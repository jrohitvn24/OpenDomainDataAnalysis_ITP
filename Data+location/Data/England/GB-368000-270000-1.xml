		<content> Situated on the high ground           
 overlooking the fertile Teme Valley,  
 the area around Mamble and Clows top  
 does not share the prosperity below.  
 Once an agricultural area with        
 coal-mining and orchards it is now in 
 a state of deepening decline.  The    
 mines are long closed; the remaining  
 orchards old and unkemp; many of the  
 farms and houses are for sale.        
 Supporting amenities mirror the       
 decline.  Clows Top has lost its pubs,
 garage, Police Station, and all but   
 two small shops.  Mamble has lost its 
 Post Office cum shop; its only pub is 
 closed (but an optimistic new owner is
 to reopen it in January 1986); even   
 the Church lacks an incumbent.  Not   
 quite all is gloom: the saw mill on   
 the site of the last colliery is      
 expanding and a pair of new houses are
 under construction in Mamble.         </content>
