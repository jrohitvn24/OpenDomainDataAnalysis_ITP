		<content> You cannot travel very far in this    
 area without seeing sheep. For them   
 the small fields and heavy clay land  
 are ideal and they have taken over as 
 the main livestock enterprise; many   
 people with a small paddock or orchard
 have a few sheep to keep down the     
 grass and provide a satisfying hobby. 
 For the serious, sometimes part-time, 
 farmer, however, it is hard work.     
 Foot-care, worming and vaccinating    
 routines can fit in between jobs.     
 Hay-making, shearing and twice yearly 
 dipping are often done by contractors.
 Lambing is the hardest time. The      
 shepherd has to be extra-vigilant;    
 prolific lambing in close proximity   
 can cause confusion and lambs not     
 correctly matched with mothers must be
 bottle-fed if rejected. However, when 
 the sheep and lambs turn on to the    
 spring fields it is well worth while. </content>
