		<title>06THE GHOSTS OF COGENHOE.</title>
		<content>{  Ghost spotting}is still quite a     
 popular hobby in Cogenhoe. Every now  
 and then groups of teenagers have     
 congregated in{St. Peter's Churchyard 
 and on a patch of rough grazing land  
 to the South. However, cynics would   
 claim that white tombstones have been 
 mistaken for gloomy apparitions.      
   The supernatural happenings revolve 
 around 2 ghosts _{both young girls.   
 The first has been sighted in a long  
 print dress with a basket over her    
 arm. Rumour has it she was jilted by  
 the local Rector's son and put an end 
 to her life.                          
   Elsewhere in the village, electric  
 lights have been turning themselves on
 and off, doors have bolted themselves 
 and shuffling and heavy breathing have
 made strong men weak at the knees.    
 Redecoration at the house has revealed
 the negative of a{dead crippled child!</content>
