		<content> From the survey we conducted in       
 Collingham and a surronding area we   
 came to these conclusions.            
 (1) The Herald and the Wetherby       
 Advertiser were the main papers       
 delivered.                            
 (2) The main items of local news in   
 June 1985 were a bad road crash       
 between a car and a tanker at the     
 Collingham road junction.This is a    
 frequent place for road crashes.      
 there had been some vandalism in the  
 churchyard,a burglary where several   
 jewels were stolen,and a dog fight.   
 Apart from all this no one could      
 recall any thing else,most people said
 it was a quiet ,even boring village.  
 (3) In most familys only two people   
 read the papers and they were the     
 adults.When interviwed the newsagent  
  said on average he sold 17948        
 papers a week.                        </content>
