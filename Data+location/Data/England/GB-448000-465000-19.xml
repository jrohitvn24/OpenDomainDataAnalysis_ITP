		<content>              {TRANSPORT               
{Roads-}In one week in Alne from the   
 3rd to the 7th of June from 1.15 to   
 2.15pm using the Easingwold road we   
 found out that there were 270 cars, 48
 vans, 48 farming vehicles, 32 bikes,  
 14 lorries, 8 motorbikes and 8 buses. 
 The bus service is to Easingwold and  
 York, approximately every two hours.  
 There is no bus service on a Sunday.  
        In a five-day survey to look   
 where traffic went to after leaving   
 the village by the cross_roads,I found
 most traffic took the Boroughbridge   
 road, then the York road and then the 
 Flawith road.                         
        The road from York to          
 Boroughbridge crosses the road from   
 Alne to Aldwark. A five-day survey of 
 traffic coming into Alne from the     
 cross-roads, I found more traffic came
 from Aldwark than Tollerton or Flawith</content>
