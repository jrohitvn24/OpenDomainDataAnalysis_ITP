		<title>17LOCAL HISTORY IN YATTON</title>
		<content>           There has                   
 been a settlement in or near Yatton   
 since prehistoric times when men      
 forfited Cadbury Hill.The remains of a
 large and well-appointed Roman villa  
 were discoverd by the river one       
 hundred years ago. The medieval linear
 village grew up along the ridge,      
 surrounding the church and village    
 green with its well. Next to the      
 church can be seen the Old Rectory, a 
 fine medieval house with decorated    
 windows. Another interesting building 
 is the 6OO year old dovecote at Ham   
 Farm, North End. With the coming of   
 the railway Yatton became increasingly
 important as the junction for         
 Clevedon, and for Cheddar with its    
 seasonal strawberry trade. It had its 
 own cattle market which existed until 
 a few years ago.
