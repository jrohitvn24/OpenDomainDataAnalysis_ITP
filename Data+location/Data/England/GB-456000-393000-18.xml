 is Christianity.Christians believe    
 that Jesus was Gods son born of Virgin
 Mary almost 2000 years ago.The 2 main

 The Christingle raises money for      
 underprivileged children.Children from
 Tickhill collect money.They receive an
 orange with a red ribbon, a candle    
 and some nuts which represent the     
 world,Jesus blood,the light and fruit 
 of the world.On Christmas Eve there is
 a carol service at the Buttercross,a  
 nativity play by children and a       
 Midnight Mass where bells are rung and
 carols sung.During Easter week there  
 are lots of special services as on{   
 Good Friday when Jesus was crucified. 
 The climax is on Easter Sunday when   
 Christ is supposed to have risen from 
 the dead.Pathfinders meet on Sundays, 
 sing songs and study the bible.       </content>
