		<content>    {Mousehole}has a Junior and Infants
 School with about eighty pupils       
 altogether.  There are three teachers,
 a headmaster and two class teachers.  
     The first day school in Mousehole 
 was provided by the{Methodists}during 
 1848 and was run by a board of        
 Trustees with each pupil paying three 
 pence a week.  Today the state pays   
 for the childrens education unless the
 parents choose to send them to a      
 private school, the nearest one to    
{Mousehole}being at{Penzance.} When the
 children reach the age of eleven most 
 will transfer from the village school 
 to{Mount's Bay Comprehensive School}  
 which is at Heamoor, Penzance.        
     Further education after the age of
 sixteen is provided by the Penwith    
{Sixth Form College}at Penzance, or at 
 the{Cornwall Technical College}which  
 is at{Camborne.                       </content>
