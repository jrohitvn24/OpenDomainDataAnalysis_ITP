		<content>{ Lammack}New extensions in 1984       
 provided extra space to serve the     
 growing community. The building is a  
 centre for a good deal of life and    
 activity for both young and old.      
 Brownies and Guides are just some of  
 the users. This year is the 25th      
 anniversary of the church and various 
 events have marked this. Recently     
 there has been a development of       
 partnerships between different        
 denominations.{                       
{Mellor}1985 saw the official opening  
 of a new chapel, replacing a much     
 larger building. During the period of 
 demolition and rebuilding, the        
 Methodists held services in the nearby
 Roman Catholic Mass Centre. During the
 two years a special relationship grew.
 Inter church partnership will continue
 to be a feature of the new life on the
 hill.                                 </content>
