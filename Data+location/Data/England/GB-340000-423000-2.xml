		<title>02LANDSCAPE OF HESKETH BANK</title>
		<content> With the area being mainly reclaimed  
 land, the land surveyed is extremely  
 flat. The only notable exceptions to  
 the north of Shore Road are the two   
 large banks, built to help reclaim the
 land. To the south of Shore Road the  
 land begins to rise quite gradually.  
 As would be expected the reclaimed    
 land is covered by a network of       
 drainage ditches which help to keep   
 the land usable for farming crops and 
 animals. The only residential area    
 consists of a council housing estate  
 and a newer private housing estate.   
 Neither of these estates have any     
 ammenities. These houses do not have  
 any gas piped in, as the Gas Board    
 have not yet piped gas into the       
 village. The only public transport    
 runs buses between Southport and      
 Preston.
