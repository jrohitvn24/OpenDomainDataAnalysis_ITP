		<title>04TEDBURN SCHOOL HISTORY 1/2</title>
		<content> "Dames" schools existed in Tedburn    
 from the early 1800's. In 1840 there  
 were 9 operating in the village.      
 In 1873 a notice was pinned to the    
 church door which said that the       
 education department required "Public 
 School Accommodation" in the district 
 for 120 children.                     
                                       
 Tedurn School was opened on the 19th  
  March 1877 for children aged 7 to 14 
 years old, and about 70 childen       
 attended in its first year. It        
 appears that boys and girls were      
 taught in separate classes.           
                                       
 Each year HMI inspectors tested the   
 standards of reading, writing and     
 arithmetic. There was also a scripture
 examination.
