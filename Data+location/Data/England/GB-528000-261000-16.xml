		<title>16Facilities in Elsworth</title>
		<content> Elsworth does not have a village hall 
 as such, and the only hall available  
 is at the school. Some members of the 
 village would like clear links and    
 both sides are looking into the       
 possibility of its being designated a 
 Community School.                     
                                       
 There is concern that because of the  
 cost of housing Elsworth is becoming  
 an aging population. It appears to be 
 losing its village identity as it     
 becomes a commuter village with an    
 independently mobile population.      
                                       
 We have just lost a small area of     
 natural woodland in Fardell's Lane for
 building houses.                      
                                       
 There is concern about the lack of    
 facilities: no medical care, only two 
 shops and very poor transport.        </content>
