		<content> St Bridget's Church, Bridgerule       
    Evidence of William Vinnicombe's   
 work can also be found in Bridgerule  
 Parish Church where he made the church
 floor consisting of 18,000 old roof   
 slates, laid tiles in the chancel and 
 installed the old heating apparatus   
 and flues. Still remaining in the     
 church from ancient times is the Saxon
 Font.                                 
    St. Bridget's Church was built in  
 the 12th Century but the first tomb   
 was laid in 1600. There are about     
 4,000 people buried in the churchyard.
 During the war one of the "ears" of   
 the tower was knocked off but there   
 have never been any break-ins.        
    Standing well above the village,   
 its tower is crowned with turrets and 
 pinnacles. It is a much loved church.
