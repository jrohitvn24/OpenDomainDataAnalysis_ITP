		<title>10LOXLEY COMMON  / GAMES</title>
		<content>{Loxley Common}is a very extensive area
 consisting of marsh,open moorland and 
 woodland. The marsh has trees growing 
 in it; mainly silver birch and small  
 oaks.There was a gibbet on the open   
 moorland in earlier times. Because the
 Common is so near to the village it is
 well used and the school uses it for  
 environmental studies.                
{Playground and Street Games}          
 The main games played by the children 
 of Loxley are Bulldog, Football,      
 Rounders, Skipping, Leap Frog,        
 Hopscotch, various tiggy games, Hide  
 and Seek and Conkers. There are rhymes
 to go with the skipping such as       
 "Tinker, tailor," and  "Salt, vinegar,
 mustard, pepper."
