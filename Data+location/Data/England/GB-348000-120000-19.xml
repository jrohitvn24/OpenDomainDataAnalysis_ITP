		<title>19UNEMPLOYMENT</title>
		<content>  An unemployed youth.Miss H>Johnston  
 has been unemployed for 4 weeks,and   
 before she was unempoyed,she was a    
 student at Yeovil College.She is      
 looking for any office work or shop   
 work and she thinks her chances of    
 getting a job are good if she keeps   
 trying.Helen thinks the job centre in 
 Yeovil is quite good but could show   
 more interest in the individual.She   
 knows a few people who have now found 
 a job through the centre,and they say 
 that their personality was as         
 important as their qualifications.    
 Helen uses her time to write job      
 applications and to do housework.She  
 says there is a lot of competition for
 the few jobs offered in Yeovil.       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
