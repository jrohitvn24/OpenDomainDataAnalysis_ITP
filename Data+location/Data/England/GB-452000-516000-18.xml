		<content> The{A174 }known as the parkway was    
 opened in 1975. It was built to       
 releive the congestion from the {     
{B1380}Normanby High Street.  The      
 Parkway is an important link between  
 I.C.I. Wilton and the {A19.           
{  }In {May 1985 } a series of traffic 
 counts took place on Flatts Lane      
 bridge above the Parkway.  Each count 
 took five minutes.                    
 Here are the results:                 
 8.25-8.30a.m.{91 vehicles west 167 E. 
 9.45-9.50a.m.{40    "      "    50 "  
 5.05-5.10p.m.{186   "      "    67 "  
                                       
 East is busiest in the morning because
 many of the vehicles are travelling to
 I.C.I.Wilton, they return to make west
 busy later in the day.
