  It is cut in two by the Parkway,the  
 A174,which separates the old village  
 from the newer housing estates which  
 serve as dormitory suburbs for        
 Cleveland.{Stewart Park,}originally   
 the private grounds of a house built  
 for the iron master{H.W.F.Bolckow,

 where James Cook was born in 1728.

 kindergarten.  The church, dedicated  
 to St. Cuthbert, was founded in the   
 1100's and rebuilt during the reign of
