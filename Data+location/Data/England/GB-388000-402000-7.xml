		<title>07The Roxy Cinema</title>
		<content>   The Mayor of Oldham opened the Roxy 
 in l938. The first manager was Mr.    
 Boddington. One of the two most       
 popular films was "The Sound of       
 Music". Below the Mini-cinema there   
 used to be a restaurant and bar. The  
 Mini-cinema opened with "Jaws" and the
 Maxi-2 with "Close Encounters". There 
 are now 3 screens in the one building.
 The whole cinema was built for        
 Â£25,000. The cinema holds 942 people  
 and they come from as far as Bolton to
 watch the films. There are 15 staff   
 with 3 full-time. Their ratings       
 boosted by 10% when other cinemas     
 closed down. The average number of    
 people who go every week is 2000. In  
 the mini-cinema the films go          
 downstairs, projected by mirrors. The 
 most popular film recently was        
 "Ghostbusters".
