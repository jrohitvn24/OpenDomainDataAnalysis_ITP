Lichfield area in 1984 these were the  
following figures for births, deaths   
and marriages: BIRTHS - 1,057; DEATHS -
777; MARRIAGES - 969.                  
A DAY IN THE LIFE FOR A:-              
YOUNG MAN - Life in Chasetown can be   
boring when he is unemployed because he
doesn't have much to do and doesn't    
have much money to do it with. He will 
not be using his education a lot in his
day. He won't be able to marry easily  
without a job.                         
MIDDLE AGED MAN - Life in Chastown can 
often be enjoyable when he has a job.  
He can get out and have a change of    
surroundings. Some education is used   
but not extensively. Children restrict 
parents finacially and sometimes       
socially.                              </content>
