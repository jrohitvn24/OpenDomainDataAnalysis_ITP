 Most of the trees in our area are     
 deciduous such as oak,ash, sycamore,  
 beech and hawthorn. The latter is used
 for hedging although many hedges have 
 been torn up to make fields bigger to 
 take the big machinery. There are some
 evergreens like yew,pine and holly.   
 There are many common wild flowers    
 like cowslip,hedge parsley,clover,    
 dandelion,nettles,vetches,campion,hop 
 trefoil,daisies and buttercups.       
 Many people enjoy growing flowers in  
 their gardens. The soil being boulder 
 clay is especially suitable for       
 growing roses.Other garden flowers are
 delphinium,lupin,sweet pea,peony,     
 aster,chrysanthemum and dahlia.       
 There are many different grasses
