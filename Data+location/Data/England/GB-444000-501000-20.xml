		<content>{Trenholme,}meaning "marshy land of the
 cranes", was drained in mediaeval     
 times by a deep stell which has needed
 regular maintenance through the       
 centuries. It also serves as a parish 
 boundary. West Lees, the{oldest farm-}
{house site,}dates from the 13th C or  
 earlier, being the Demesne farm of the
 Lords Meynill of Whorlton Castle.     
{Oxhill}dates from the 16th C. Two     
 deerparks, now farmland, lie south and
 east of Swainby. In the 18th C{Potto} 
 was a linen weaving and bleaching     
 centre; a tilery provided drain and   
 pantiles. A mineral branch line from  
 Potto Station to Swainby, opened in   
 1857 for the removal of ironstone, was
 dismantled c.1905. The{drove road}from
 Yarm to York lies just west of        
 Swainby. A{pinfold,}now converted to a
 public garden, remains in Swainby.
