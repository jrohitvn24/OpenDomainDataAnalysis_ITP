		<title>14PENJERRICK GARDENS</title>
		<content> Penjerrick gardens was first owned by 
 Robert Were Fox the second            
 (1789-1877).                          
 It is said that he was one of the     
 greatest scientists Cornwall has      
 produced.With the help of his         
 daughters, Caroline and Anna-Maria,   
 he founded the Royal Cornwall         
 Polytechnic Society.                  
 Penjerrick was one of his homes and   
 now the gardens are open to visitors  
 one day a week.The grounds are full of
 trees and shrubs including  camelias, 
 azaleas,rhododendrons and hydrangeas. 
 A picturesque bridge in the gardens   
 crosses the Budock - Mawnan Smith road
 into an area known as 'The Wilderness'
 where there is a lily pond and many   
 different varieties of tropical fern, 
 probably gathered as a result of the  
 family's shipping business.
