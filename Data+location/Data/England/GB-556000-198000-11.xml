		<content> From our survey (of families with at  
 least one child aged 8-11) it would   
 seem that almost every household has  
 one person in{full employment.}Over   
 half of our sample had two or more    
 adults employed, but in many cases the
 mother worked part-time. Occupations  
 listed were generally{skilled}or      
{professional.                         
 Many people worked locally in         
 Brentwood or other parts of south     
 Essex and used a{car}to travel to     
 work. About half of our sample worked 
 in London and drove to the station in 
 Brentwood to catch a{train}into       
 Liverpool St. Station; some continued 
 their journey by underground. For a   
 few, travelling extensively is part of
 their job, while some work near enough
 to home to{cycle}or{walk}to their     
 place of employment.
