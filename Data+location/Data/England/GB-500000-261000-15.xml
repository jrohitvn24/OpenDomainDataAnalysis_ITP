      We have three leaders who are    
 Akela, Raksha and Chil.  We have three
 sixes - blue, yellow and green.  There
 are many things which we do over the  
 year from playing football against the
 other cub packs in the district to    
 cooking competitions.                 
      This year from September l984 to 
 September l985 Riseley cubs have won a
 sports shield at Colmworth, come joint
 first in the football and won through 
 to represent the District in the      
 county at the Camp Cooking            
 Competition.  We also go camping.     
 This year the boys have been to the   
 district camp at Great Barford and    
 also a weekend camp.  There will be   
 another weekend camp with the scouts  
 at the end of the summer combined with
 a barbeque.  This will also raise     
 funds.                                </content>
