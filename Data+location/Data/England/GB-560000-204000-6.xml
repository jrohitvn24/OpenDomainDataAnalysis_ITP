		<title>06A FARM WORKER, RADLEY GREEN</title>
		<content> I have been a farm worker since I left
 school. My normal working day is 8    
 hours but I have worked as late as    
 11p.m.at harvest. When I worked with  
 cows I used to get up at 4 a.m. but   
 round here it's all arable now. There 
 used to be part-time jobs like potato 
 picking but not any more.Quite a few  
 full-time jobs have gone too like mine
 for instance. I am pleased I have my  
 own bungalow and not a tied cottage.My
 job has gone for the moment but at    
 least I keep my home.                 
 I have always done general farm work. 
 I might do 5 or 6 different jobs a day
 like spraying,setting up the combine. 
 heaping corn,baling or carting.Or I   
 might do the same job all day long.My 
 favourite is baling.I can do 2-4,000  
 bales a day.The job I dislike is spray
 ing.I might be doing it all day,though
 I've never been hurt by a spray yet.  </content>
