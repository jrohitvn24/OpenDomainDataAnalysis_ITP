 Most animal farmers go in for pig     
 rearing but there are plenty of beef  
 cattle and one farmer specialises in  
 goats.                                
       The farms are quite large and a 
 typical one is Mr.Crossley's which is 
 400 acres in 26 fields.               
      The pigs are fed on pig cobs     
 which are bought from Thomsons of     
 Murton.The cattle are fed  on Mr.     
 Crossley's own barley and also hay.   
      There are hardly any sheep at all
 to be found in this area, but there   
 are thousands on the North York Moors 
 and the Yorkshire Wolds which are     
 about  20 miles away.                 
     The area between here and Malton  
 is well known for training race       
 horses.Mr.Brittain trains 50 horses at
 Warthill in this block.
