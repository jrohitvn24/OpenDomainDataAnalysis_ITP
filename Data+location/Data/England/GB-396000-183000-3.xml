		<content>   We invited local people to answer a 
 questionnaire about their work and 42 
 replied.Of these 13 worked locally,   
 mostly in farming,while 29 commuted to
 the following places;10 worked in     
 Swindon,7 in Bath,5 in Chippenham,4 in
 Malmesbury,3 in London,2 in Lyneham   
 camp,1 in Oxford and 1 in Christian   
 Malford.                              
   Swindon is one of the fastest       
 growing towns in Europe,especially in 
 the micro-technology industries.      
   People can get to the larger towns  
 either by the M4 motorway or by train 
 from Chippenham, which is only one    
 hour from London. From our survey we  
 learned that people choose to live    
 here because it is rural,pleasant and 
 is within easy reach of their places  
 of work.
