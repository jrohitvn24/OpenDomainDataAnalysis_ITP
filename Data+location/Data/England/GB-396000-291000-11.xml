		<title>11Tipton Carnival</title>
		<content> Tipton Carnival is an event which is  
 held every year.There is a procession 
 which goes through all the streets of 
 Tipton.There are people who are       
 dressed up collecting money for       
 charities. There is  a band which     
 marches in front of  the carnival     
 floats.The floats are lorries         
 decorated according to a special theme
 such as Alice in Wonderland or Snow   
 White and the Seven Dwarves.Then the  
 procession goes to Jubilee Park where 
 there is a fair.There you can go on   
 many fairground rides which cost 40p  
 each.The fair stays there for three   
 days.In the afternoons the entrance   
 fee is 25p,but after six o'clock you  
 can get in free.The fair finishes at  
 midnight on Sunday.You then have to   
 wait another year for it to come      
 again.
