		<title>10T. JAMES HAULAGE-W.SLEEKBURN</title>
		<content> The main interest of the business is  
 haulage but in addition they also     
 store coal, coke and salt.These items 
 are stored in large huts with a       
 capacity of 32 tons each.             
   In the office two young women       
 organise the sending of bills with the
 aid of computer record keeping.Mr     
 James's son also works in the         
 reception area looking after the      
 transportation.                       
   There are many regulations          
 controlling the use of lorries which  
 must be followed before the company   
 can gain a license.If more lorries are
 wanted a new license would have to be 
 obtained.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
