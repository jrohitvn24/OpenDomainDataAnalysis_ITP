		<title>02The Landscape of Knockholt</title>
		<content> This area is on the edge of the North 
 Downs with the crest of the hills     
 running diagonally from South West to 
 North East. The scarp slope is steep  
 and chalky with richer fields at its  
 foot in the Darent valley. The dip    
 slope faces North and is undulating   
 with two deep dry valleys. It is      
 covered with clay, with flints in the 
 clay near the crest of the Downs.There
 is little surface water.              
  Although the area is extensively     
 farmed there are many woods and       
 copses.  A clump of trees on the crest
 of the Downs form the landmark of     
{Knockholt Beeches}which can be seen   
 from many miles away, both North and  
 South. There are distant views form   
 the crest of the Downs - the hills    
 beyond the Medway and the City of     
 London and its tower blocks can be    
 seen on a clear day.                  </content>
