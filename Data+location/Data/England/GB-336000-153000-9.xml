		<content>   ON THE VALLEY ROAD,ALONG THE        
SOUTHERN FOOTHILLS OF THE MENDIPS,THE  
VISITOR THROUGH RACKLEY BEFORE         
REALISING THAT HE HAS PASSED THROUGH A 
SETTLEMENT.                            
   TODAY THERE IS A ROW OF FOUR        
COTTAGES WITH A FEW ISOLATED HOUSES.   
THESE MAKE UP TODAYS RACKLEY.          
   VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE DAYS WHEN   
NAVIGATION ON THE RIVER AXE WAS A      
REGULAR OCCURANCE,WHEN RACKLEY  HAD ITS
OWN LANDING STAGE AND WHEN GOODS WERE  
REGUALARLY BROUGHT IN AND TAKEN OUT.   
   THE HAMLET NOW HAS NO AMENITIES AND 
THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE ARE LINKED     
CLOSELY WITH AGRICULTURE.              
   TO SUPPLEMENT THEIR INCOME,         
STRAWBERRIES ARE GROWN ON THE SOUTH    
FACING MENDIP SLOPES ADJACENT TO THEIR 
HOMES.                                 
                                       
                                       </content>
