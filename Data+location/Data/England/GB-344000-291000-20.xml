		<content>   There are two small, pretty pubs in 
 Little Stretton. Both of them are old 
 with very low ceilings. Lots of people
 go in for drinks and main meals. There
 is one general store called Keenans   
 Grocers. There is a new estate of     
 bungalows called Crown Close. There   
 are some biggish new houses but most  
 of the rest are old and quite small.  
 There are two biggish farms.          
   There are many old people who move  
 here to retire.                       
  {Ashes Hollow}is a peaceful valley   
 with a stream and footpath. There is  
 a camp site by the ford.              
   There is an unusual black and white 
{thatched church.}The church is not    
 registered for weddings. You need     
 permision from the Archbishop of      
 Canterbury to have a wedding there.   
 There have been only two{weddings in  
{the last 80 years.}                   </content>
