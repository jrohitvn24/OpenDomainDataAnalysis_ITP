		<content>  Dagenham Heathway is a long road     
 lined with small shops either side. It
 seems as soon as one shop opens       
 another closes down. Some people say  
 this is because of the high rates     
 people have to pay. The Heathway has a
 bingo club, ballroom and disco dancing
 and keep-fit.                         
  The Barking and Dagenham town show is
 a big event,each summer people crowd  
 the streets to watch the procession   
 pass into the Central park. It is an  
 important event, in the life of       
 Barking and Dagenham.                 
  There is room for improvement in     
 Dagenham, but compared with some other
 areas we are lucky and should         
 appreciate what we have got.
