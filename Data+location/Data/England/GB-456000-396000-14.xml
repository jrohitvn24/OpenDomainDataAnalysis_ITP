 buildings , not least of these is     
 Wadworth church.It is built on the top
 of the hill and has a commanding view 
 of the surrounding countryside.Another
 of these buildings is Wadworth        
 hall. Built behind the church in 1750 
 it is a fine example of Georgian      
 architecture. Situated at the bottom  
 of Carr lane is Wadworth manor house. 
 It was originally built around 1450   
 but was pulled down since but has been
 rebuilt by Donald Butler. The White   
 Hart is one of the two village pubs   
 and was once a coaching inn. It stands
 on the same side of the road as the   
 manor house. Opposite the White Hart  
 is The Fox and Hounds it is the second
 of the village pubs. In front of the  
 White Hart is the old maypole it was  
 an old tram pole erected at the time  
 the motorway was built.               </content>
