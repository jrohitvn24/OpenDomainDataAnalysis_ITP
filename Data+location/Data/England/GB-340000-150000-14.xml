		<content>  Fifty years ago Chapel Allerton was a
 small, quiet village where most of the
 people worked on the nearby farms or  
 were farmers themselves. There were   
 few cars, no tractors and none of the 
 noisy machinery of today. There were  
 three shops in the village then and   
 everyone used them for their shopping.
 Every morning the paperman cycled from
 Draycott to deliver the newspapers,   
 the postman came at 07:00 a.m. and was
 never late. The butcher brought meat  
 twice weekly and the baker came three 
 times a week. The houses had no       
 electricity. Oil lamps and candles    
 were used for light. The water for    
 baths was heated over a furnace and   
 poured into a large tin bath in front 
 of the fire. The only entertainment   
 was listening to the wireless or going
 to whist drives and sometimes a dance 
 in the village hall.                  </content>
