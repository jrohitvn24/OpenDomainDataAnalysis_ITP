		<content> There are also some magnificent wall  
 paintings in the Nave on the East wall
 above the chancel arch. The paintings 
 are thought to be of Anglo Saxon date.
 The picture is said to be of Christ in
 majesty within a mandorla supported by
 four flying angels. Their date is now 
 believed to be about 960 AD. This is  
 the only Saxon wall painting in it,s  
 original place. Above the replaced    
 pillar in the south wall a late 15th  
 century painting represents a warning 
 to Sabbath breakers.There is a figure 
 of christ dressed only in a loin cloth
 . It is said if you break the Sabbath 
 you put a wound on Christ's body.     
 There is also a mural of St.George and
 the Dragon. Christianity is shown by  
 St.George and Evil by the Dragon.
