		<content>  By using questionnaires and personal 
interviews a cross-section of the local
population gave opinions on life in Old
Coulsdon in 1985.It was felt that this 
was a friendly neighbourhood,with local
shops providing a homely service.      
  Children felt,however that they were 
treated less well than adults when     
shopping, often being served after     
adults in spite of queue priority.     
Pavement parking was considered a      
dangerous nuisance by all age-groups,  
and the elderly thought the pavements  
ill-maintained. Children favoured      
the extension of the vehicle speed     
restriction,but adults disagreed.      
  Police foot patrols around the       
streets, operating from a local        
station were considered a priority by  
all age-groups.The younger element     
pressed for a youth centre,and sports  
facilities.                            </content>
