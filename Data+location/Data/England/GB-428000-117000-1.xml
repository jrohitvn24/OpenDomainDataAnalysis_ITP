		<content>Wellow is a growing Hampshire country  
village split by the A36-Canada to the 
east and Wellow village to the west.   
  Canada backs onto the New Forest,and 
was named when many people moved to    
North America.The houses are mainly    
19th century and there is also the     
Abbots Farm Nursery here.              
  Across the A36,houses become mixed.  
This was once due to the number of     
evacuees who decided to settle here,but
in recent years housing estates have   
been built with commuters in mind.These
newer homes mixed with the old         
established ones and have in some cases
led to controversy.                    
  Wellow is a village combining old and
new and including many interesting     
features.
