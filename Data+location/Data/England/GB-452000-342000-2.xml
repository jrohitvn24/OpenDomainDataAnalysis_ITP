		<content> Tina interviewed Mrs Torvill,who lives
 opposite our school, about her        
 daughter Jayne,World,Olympic and      
 European Ice-dance champion,1984.     
 Jayne was nine when she started ice   
 skating.She had to get up at 5am to   
 train for four to seven hours each    
 day.Her mum felt like telling her to  
 give up at times.The first trophy she 
 won was the Rose Bud at Bristol with  
 partner Christopher Dean.Jayne enjoys 
 being professional and touring around 
 the world.She would like better       
 facilities in Britain to encourage    
 young skaters to try their skills out 
 as youngsters.Mrs Torvill did not     
 realize Jayne was going to be a       
 champion until she won the World      
 Championship for the first time with  
 Chris in 1981.She told us that you    
 don't really expect your own daughter 
 to become famous.                     </content>
