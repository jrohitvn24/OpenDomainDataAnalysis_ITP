		<title>11Education in Staverton</title>
		<content> In 1957 the number on roll at the     
 Staverton School fell to 8 so the     
 School next to the church was sold and
 is now a private dwelling.The children
 were taken to Landscove and the two   
 schools joined.For the children up to 
 the age of 11 there is quite a choice 
 of schools ,however the L.E.A. will   
 only provide transport for those      
 within the catchment area. Some go to 
 the Steiner Schooland other private   
 schools ,some to larger local state   
 schools such as Dartington but a      
 majority attend Landscove. The 1980   
 Education Act and greater parent      
 mobility has made this possible,but   
 for country children each day still   
 begins with the inevitable car or bus 
 ride.Of 32 children at Landscove only 
 8 walk regularly ,and only 5 in all   
 weathers. After 11 most children go to
 Totnes Comprehensive School by bus!   </content>
