		<title>09ALMHOUSES - BUILDING</title>
		<content> The almshouses were built 1839 and    
 became listed in 1973. They are owned 
 by a group of trustees one of whom    
 must be the Vicar of Wadsley Church.  
 The almshouses are in the grounds of  
 the church near an old school and a   
 graveyard. There are 6 houses all in  
 a row. All the almshouses are very    
 small. Wadsley Church has always      
 controlled the almshouses and the     
 people who inhabit them. There is     
 always a waiting list of 3-4 people.  
 To be eligible for an almshouse you   
 have to be a widow, over 60, and a    
 pensioner.                            
   In the midle of the houses is a     
 plaque and it says;'Thus saith the    
 Lord, 'And even to your old age I am  
 here'' -ISIAH                         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
