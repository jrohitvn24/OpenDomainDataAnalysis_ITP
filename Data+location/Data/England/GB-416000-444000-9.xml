		<title>09LEISURE FACILITIES IN OTLEY.</title>
		<content> Otley is a busy market town and a very
 interesting place to visit for the    
 day. The inhabitants disagree and say 
 that it could do with more facilities.
   In Burley there are many facilities 
 eg. four pubs, and for sports there is
 bowls, cricket, football and tennis.  
 In the park you can take a stroll. The
 town also has a library and a town    
 hall.                                 
   In Westbourne and Newall, Otley has 
 a playground, a bowling green, two    
 swimming pools, tennis courts and a   
 golf club.For the young, Prince       
 Henry's Grammar School runs some youth
 clubs.For old age pensioners there is 
 a bingo hall.                         
   We did a survey in Otley and found  
 out the favourite hobbies for men were
 gardening, woodwork and cycling. For  
 women they were knitting, gardening,  
 embroidery and reading.               </content>
