 On the walls of Kent House Stables    
 there were some orange blocks.        
 Mr.Allan said they tasted like salt   
 and the horses liked them. The big    
 wheel on the carriages had oak spokes,
 ash felloes and the centre wheel was  
 made out of elm. One of the carriages 
 once carried Peggy Mount, an actress. 
 The gypsy caravan had cupboards, a    
 fireplace, a sink and a bed.

 children can work and ride the        
 horses.{Everybody is welcome.
