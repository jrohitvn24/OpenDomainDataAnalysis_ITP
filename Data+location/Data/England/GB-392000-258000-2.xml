		<title>02Farming Around Himbleton (1)</title>
		<content>      This is a very mixed area for    
 farming , ranging from highly         
 intensive systems to extensive ones.  
      Most of the land is overlying a  
 clay subsoil , with a limestone ridge 
 running right across the area.        
      Within the area there are a      
 number of acres of woodland. These are
 a mixture of Oak , Birch and Beech    
 harbouring a variety of wildlife.     
      The extensive farming consists of
 the feeding and rearing of sheep and  
 beef animals on grass , many of the   
 meadows used have been permanently in 
 grass for centuries , especially those
 which run close to brooks. Both lambs 
 and beef are fattened on the grass    
 ready for consumption.
