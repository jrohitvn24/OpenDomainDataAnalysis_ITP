		<content> The River Torridge, makes a 1km.wide  
meander to the east about the middle of
the area,after which it is joined by   
the R.Yeo,a small tributary from the   
south-west.The tidal nature of both    
rivers explains the dramatic changes   
in scenery and atmosphere occurring    
throughout the day.At full tide when   
the saltmarshes,located mainly on the  
eastern side of the Torridge ,are flood
-ed,the normal width of the river of   
10- 20 yds.,is increased to c.200 yds..
The valley sides of both rivers rise   
sharply,close to the rivers in most pla
-ces,to heights of 300-375 ft.,and in- 
accessibility is probably the main reas
-on for the survival here of areas of  
deciduous woodland,amounting in all to 
about 1sq.km..Jennett's Reservoir in   
the extreme mid-west of the area is par
-ticularly interesting , pulsing with  
life and energy.                       </content>
