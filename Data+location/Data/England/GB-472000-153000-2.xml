		<title>02GROWTH OF HOOK</title>
		<content>    Hook is one of the settlements     
 designated in the Hampshire Structure 
 Plan as being suitable for growth.    
 Land is being developed in Hook to the
 East of the A32 and further land      
 between the A32 and A30.              
    Further development is constrained 
 to the south by Bartley Heath, a large
 area of common land. To the west and  
 north, large scale development would  
 affect an area of important landscape,
 be visually intrusive, could result in
 the coalescence of Hook and other     
 neighburing settlements and would     
 cause congestion on minor roads. To   
 the north east development would be a 
 clearly visible intrusion into the    
 open countryside.Three future options 
 for development are set out in a draft
 plan soon to be available for public  
 inspection.Hart Council's preference  
 is for expansion north of the A30.    </content>
