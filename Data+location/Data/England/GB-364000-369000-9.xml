		<title>09Locks On The River Weaver</title>
		<content> The transport on the River Weaver need
 to use Vale Royal Locks. The River    
 Weaver has been important in          
 transporting goods especially salt. Up
 until 1721AD the river was difficult  
 to navigate. The big lock was built in
 1889. The small in 1860. There is very
 little traffic mainly for recreation. 
 The lock keeper who lives near the    
 locks is a bank walker. He helps      
 people use the locks. He works        
 full-time maintaining the locks. He is
 employedby the British Waterway Board.
 The surrounding wildlife is intresting
 and includes stoats, rabbits, hares,  
 weasles and a variety of water and    
 garden birds. The fish caught include 
 bream, roach, tench, carp, eel and    
 pike. The railway line passing Moulton
 was the first one to be opened in     
 Cheshire it was built around 1883 and 
 called the Grand Junction.            </content>
