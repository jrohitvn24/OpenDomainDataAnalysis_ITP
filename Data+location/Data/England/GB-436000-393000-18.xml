 When I woke up yesterday morning I had
 a wash and went downstairs for break  
 fast. I had raisins, then I brushed my
 teeth with toothpaste. I got out my   
 coat and put it on then I put on my   
 shoes then I got in the car and we    
 went to school. When I got to school  
 we had the register. Then we went for 
 our assembly about the sower. I did
