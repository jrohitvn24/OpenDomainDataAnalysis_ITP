 1947. The school organized it for four
 years then it was taken over by the   
 village, which formed a Rose Queen    
 committee. On the committee there are 
 about 20-22 people.The first girl ever
 to be {Queen}was chosen because she   
 fitted in the Headmistress' wedding   
 dress. Years ago at the Rose Queen you
 could eat as much as you liked for{1/6
 Now all the money goes to the fund for
 the old peoples party at Christmas.But
 all the children taking part in the   
 procession are provided with a special
 tea in a marquee.  At the Rose Queen  
 there are stalls,tombola,bouncy castle
 fairground rides, pram races, sticky  
 buns,Magican,Punch and Judy shows. The
 Rose Queen officially starts by a     
 procession from the school round the  
 village: a white pony leads, then the 
 Band playing,followed by the Cubs.p.11</content>
