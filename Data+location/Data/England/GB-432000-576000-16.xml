		<title>16The New Harbour Entrance</title>
		<content>      Thomas Delaval began his work on 
 the new entrance in the Autumn of     
 1761. A cut was to be driven straight 
 East from the river bend to the sea, a
 distance of 900 feet. The task was a  
 formidable one for the way was through
 solid rock. After several months of   
 hewing at the rock and making little  
 headway, Delaval decided to use a     
 German method of blasting with lime.  
 This was a huge success and the new   
 cut was ready in 1764. However, an    
 error had been made in gauging the    
 high water mark, which meant that the 
 dock was too shallow for capacity     
 loading. To save expense and delay,   
 the cut was deepened in 1772, having a
 new depth of eleven to sixteen feet of
 water.
