		<content>   The twinning of English towns and   
 villages with others of similar size  
 on the continent began after the war  
 with the aim  of  increasing          
 international understanding and       
 friendship. Following the signing of a
 twinning charter by the county of     
 Devon and the department of Calvados  
 in Northern{France}, many towns and   
 villages in{Devon}twinned with places 
 in{Calvados .                         
   In 1976{Swimbridge}signed a twinning
 charter with{St.Honorine Du Fay,}a    
 village of about a 1000 inhabitants   
 situated approximately eight miles    
 from Caen . Every year since then a   
 group of young people has spent a week
 in houses in their twin village and in
 alternate years a party of adults     
 spend a weekend in each others        
             village.
