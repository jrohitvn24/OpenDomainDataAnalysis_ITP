		<title>05LAND RECLAMATION AT IBSTOCK</title>
		<content>   When the open-cast coal mine at     
 Ibstock is closed in 1990 the         
 contractors will fill in the holes and
 return the sub-soil and top-soil. The 
 site will be handed over to the       
 Ministry of Agriculture as            
 agricultural land and be left for five
 years. It may then be sold for farming
 or development in other ways.         
   A report from Birmingham University 
 suggested that the site could be used 
 to build an Adventure World recreation
 area. Tourists, they say, would be    
 attracted to North-West Leicestershire
 and jobs created.                     
   This scheme seems impractical as the
 deep holes need filling and the cliff 
 faces are not stable.                 
   However, new ideas may be explored  
 before the future of the site is      
 finally decided.
