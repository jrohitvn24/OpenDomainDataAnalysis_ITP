  Dinsdale is a village which looks    
 the same today as it must have looked 
 centuries ago, the only difference    
 being a through tarmac road, instead  
 of an extension of the Roman Road.    
                                       
  Stone built houses and farm houses of
 varying sizes and age stand round the 
 village church and Manor House in the 
 style of an ancient settlement.       
                                       
  There is no shop, telephone box or   
 bus service, and the children are     
 taken to school at the nearby village 
 of Hurworth by transport provided by  
 Durham County Council.                
                                       
  This is a truly rural and close knit 
 community.
