		<content>      The line runs from Melton Mowbray
 to Edwalton near Nottingham Since it  
 is now closed to regular traffic there
 are no stations at either end and at  
 least two of the old station buildings
 have been turned into restaurants.The 
 track is now used by{British Rail}for 
 testing purposes but in its heyday was
 owned by the London Midland and       
 Scottish Railway and was suitable for 
 speeds up to{100 mph.                 
      The line has been used for       
 testing various designs including the 
{Advanced Passenger Train}and the{BREL 
{Railbus}-a new vehicle which is       
 virtually a bus on railway wheels.    
      Last year the line gained fame   
 when a train was crashed into a       
{'flask'}for carrying{nuclear waste,}to
 prove that there was no chance of a   
 full flask leaking in an accident.
