		<title>10Early History Of Upton.</title>
		<content> It is likely that there was a         
 settlement at Upton in prehistoric    
 times already practising settled      
 farming and trading when the{Romans   
 arrived in AD 43, but the first       
 recorded mention was in a late 8th    
 century document when King Coenwulf of
 Mercia granted land at Upton to the   
 Abbey at Winchcombe.  In 962 a Charter
 of Oswald, Bishop of Worcester gave   
 six hides of land at Upton to his     
 Thane Cynelm.  In the{Domesday Book   
 Upton is part of the Manor of Ripple  
 (ton = area of land, up = up from     
 Ripple).  Sometime after{1066 King    
{William}granted areas of land to his  
 followers and trade with France and   
 Europe increased.  Upton became       
 important as a centre on a tidal river
 with adjacent land producing          
 exportable goods. An annual fair and  
 weekly market was held in Upton.      </content>
