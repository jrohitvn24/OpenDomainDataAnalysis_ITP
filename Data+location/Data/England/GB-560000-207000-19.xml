		<title>19CONSERVATION IN ROXWELL</title>
		<content>     The FARMERS in the area have been 
 greatly concerned about conservation  
 in recent years.                      
     Areas of waste land and woods have
 been purposely left to nature.        
     New areas of woodland have been   
 planted on several of the farms       
 including specimens of{WILLOW, PINE,  
{POPLARS, CHESTNUT, LIME, OAK, ASH,    
{LAURELS, COPPER BEECH AND MAPLE.}     
     There are many ponds and moats    
 where fish, wild geese and ducks, and 
 many native and specially introduced  
 plants can be found.                  
     There are{BADGERS}to be found     
 within the area with plans for a {    
{BADGER WATCH}to be erected at Newland 
 Hall.                                 
     {WILD DEER}are also living in the 
 area and come into gardens during     
 winter searching for food.
