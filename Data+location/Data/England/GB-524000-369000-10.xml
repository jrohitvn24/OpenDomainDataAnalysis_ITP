		<title>10SHOPS IN HORNCASTLE</title>
		<content>  We spoke to many shop owners in      
 Horncastle.This is a summary of their 
 answers to our questions.             
                                       
  Many of the owners of smaller shops  
 in Horncastle would like to be        
 positioned nearer to the town centre, 
 where most of the bigger shops can    
 afford to stay.The bigger shops can   
 also get deliveries when they are     
 needed and they can order products    
 which are not normally stocked.       
 However, the smaller shops have to    
 wait for deliveries and are sometimes 
 unable to supply  a customer's needs. 
 These shops receive deliveries two or 
 three times a month .                 
                                       
  Most shops, small or large, are open 
 five or six days a week. Some smaller 
 shops are open on Sundays which helps 
 their sales.                          </content>
