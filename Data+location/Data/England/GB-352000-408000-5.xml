		<content>      Wrightington hospital is situated
 between Standish and Parbold about six
 miles northwest of Wigan and stands at
 an altitude of 300 feet above sea     
 level.  The area of the estate is 159 
 acres.  Originally it was Wrightington
 Hall, an estate dating back to 1282.  
 The end of the last century saw the   
 beginning of decline in Wrightington  
 Hall's fortunes and in 1918 it was    
 bought by Lancashire County Council.  
      Plans and alterations were       
 completed in 1931.  It was a          
 custom-built tuberculosis hospital.   
 Today it is renowned for it's joint   
 replacement surgery.  There are also  
 departments which deal with chest     
 complaints and physiotherapy.  The    
 hospital comprises 14 wards and 3     
 operating theatres.
