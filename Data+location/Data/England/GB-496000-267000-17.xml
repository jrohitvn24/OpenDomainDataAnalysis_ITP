		<title>17THE HIGHAM FERRERS' RAILWAY</title>
		<content>A railway was built from the Midland   
main line to Higham Ferrers in 1890.   
The station master had to send 20lbs of
walnuts annually to the St. Pancras    
Hotel London from a tree still growing 
in Higham Ferrers. The passenger line  
was closed in 1959 and 10 years later  
the line was dismantled.               
                                       
Nowadays the railway line is used as a 
footpath and motorbike track. The local
scout group have their scout hut on the
line. The line which is overgrown is   
ideal for nature watchers, however some
people spoil it by dumping rubbish.    
                                       
Factories have been built and are still
being built on the site of the old     
railway.
