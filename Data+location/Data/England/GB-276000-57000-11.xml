		<title>11Food &amp; diet (Harberton)</title>
		<content> People make an effort to grow as many 
 vegetables and as much fruit as they  
 can. Many of the village gardens are  
 small but allotments are available.   
                                       
 There is a general awareness of the   
 importance of a healthy diet and some 
 people are eating less meat and dairy 
 products. Along with the interest in  
 food and diet has come a revival in   
 the growth and use of herbs. The      
 preparation of food is much aided by  
 recent innovations in electrical      
 kitchen equipment. Many households    
 rely on mixers and food processors and
 with no shops locally the freezer is  
 considered by many to be essential for
 meat, bread, and surplus garden       
 produce storage.
