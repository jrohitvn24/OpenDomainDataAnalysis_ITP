		<title>10CROSSLEY FARM - MIRFIELD</title>
		<content> We surveyed Crossley Farm, owned by   
 Messrs. Hurst &amp; Barber, who specialise
 in{dairy farming.}This is carried out 
 in buildings, some of which are 100   
 years old. The area of buildings      
 currently in use is 22,000 sq.feet.   
 Farmer Barber has 180 cows, 20 calves 
 and 1 bull. The area of farmland being
 used for{grass growing}is 200 acres   
 and there are also 3 acres of{        
{woodland. }The type of milk produced  
 is Green Top, Pasteurised and         
 Semi-Skimmed. The quantity of milk    
 produced per annum is in{excess of    
{1,000,000 litres.}The number of people
{employed}on the farm is 4 full-time   
 men, 3 part-time men and 1 part-time  
 woman. The main change that has been  
 made is that more machinery is now    
 being used, also more semi-skimmed    
 milk is being produced. Retail trade  
 has also expanded.                    </content>
