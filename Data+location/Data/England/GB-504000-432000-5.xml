		<content> Who is{JAFFA? }Nobody seems to know,  
 or if they do, and surely many must,  
 they are not telling.  During this    
 summer of 1985, a wet and cool affair,
 he/she left his/her signature all over
 the{Orchard Park Estate. }Wherever    
 there was surface large enough for    
 yard high letters the spray can was in
 use. Not only the spatial hoardings of
 gymnasia walls - anywhere secluded or 
 shut away has suffered the artists    
 spray. The shuttered{Orchard Park     
{Centre,}the numerous small underpasses
 and most entrances to high rise blocks
 have little space for any more        
 graffiti. {Happy Nude Year from the   
{Orchard Park Streaker}is faintly still
 there twenty yards along a low curtain
 wall eight months after January. The  
 glaring, multi-colour writings are    
 eyesores to most people but perhaps   
 they are "messages", cries for help.  </content>
