		<title>01OWSLEBURY CUB HUT</title>
		<content>    The two huts were built so that the
 cubs and scouts would have a place to 
 store their equipment.The builder was 
 Mr.J.Merritt with the help of Mrs.    
 Merritt,Mr. Weeks and Mr.P.Allen.It   
 took three years to build.            
    The cub huts were dismantled in    
 Winchester and brought to Owslebury by
 Mr Gough and rebuilt. The cub huts are
 used by cubs, visiting cubs and       
 brownies. The huts are made of wood   
 with an asbestos roof and concrete    
 floors.                               
    In olden days, the cub huts were   
 sometimes used by the council. When it
 was first built all scouts and cubs   
 wore shorts,socks to the knees, kakhi 
 shirts and berets. The past leaders   
 have been Mr Merritt, Mr Williams, Mr 
 Johnson, Mrs Weeks, Mr Allen, Mr Smith
 and Mr Holmes.
