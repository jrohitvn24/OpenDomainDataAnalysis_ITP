		<content> farmland,the major landcover is       
                                       
 enclosed rough grazing.The other half 
 of our D.Block is residential and     
 commercial areas.                     
   There are many games to play,that   
 are played at home and at school,like 
 skipping.There are different games for
 skipping like:on the mountain,under   
 and over,vote vote,I'm a little bumper
 car,etc.Some people play active sports
 like:tennis,football and cricket or   
 sometimes they play spectator sports  
 like:squash,table tennis and netball. 
   In one part of our D.Block,Radstock,
 we have traffic problems,because we   
 did have traffic lights,but it is now 
 being to two mini roundabouts.There is
 now hardly any pedestrian crossings,  
 which are now making pedestrians      
 angry,and that is why it is harder to 
 cross the road.                       </content>
