		<title>09HOUSING WOODSPRING VILLAGES</title>
		<content> There has been very little housing    
 development in either Wick St.        
 Lawrence or Kingston Seymour over the 
 years and the populations have        
 remained steady for more than a       
 century.The building that has taken   
 place has individual dwellings on an  
 infilling basis.Both have some houses 
 owned by Woodspring District Council  
 and let to families unable to purchase
 their own homes. They largely replace 
 the tied cottages provided by farmers 
 for their workers. There is concern   
 that the need for housing in Worle,   
 Weston Super Mare and Clevedon will   
 cause these towns to spill over their 
 boundaries and swallow up the village 
 While recognising the need for houses 
 the arguments for development have to 
 be weighed against the loss of farming
 land and the amenities of open spaces 
 for leisure and recreation.           </content>
