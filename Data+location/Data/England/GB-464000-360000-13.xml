		<content> The first the people of Bilsthorpe    
 heard of the landfill scheme was when 
 they were invited to a meeting at the 
 Junior School. Despite great          
 opposition by many of the population, 
 including meetings and petitions the  
 Notts. County Council have gone ahead 
 with the plan. An old brickyard is to 
 be filled with household rubbish from 
 other areas. The main oppositions were
 the sight of the dump, but this should
 be screened from view from all sides  
 by landscaping and tree planting. High
 fencing should stop the rubbish       
 blowing all over. With the high volume
 of lorries coming to the tip a major  
 new roundabout is being constructed.  
 There will be a footpath from         
 Bilsthorpe to Farnsfield along the old
 railway line.
