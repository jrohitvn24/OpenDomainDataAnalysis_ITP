		<title>01Emblehope Moor</title>
		<content> This is the title from the ordnance   
 survey.   A better one would be the   
 Emblehope Amphhitheatre.   Viewed from
 the south, there is an area of 7km W  
 to E &amp; 4km S to N, rough moorland with
 only two lonely farms.   There is only
 one rough road in from the south      
 passing the Comb &amp; running through the
 forest.   There is no road out on any 
 other side &amp; only one rough path to   
 the north, otherwise both bogs &amp; rocks
 have to be contented with.   It is a  
 magnificant sight on a fine door, but 
 the farms must be the loneliest in    
 England - only one is at present      
 occupied.   Many sheep &amp; a few cattle 
 are there, also the roe deer from the 
 forest.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
