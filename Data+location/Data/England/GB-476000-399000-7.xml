		<title>07THE HAXEY HOOD GAME</title>
		<content>   The earliest date that they have got
 proof of that the Haxey Hood has been 
 going on,is 1828,which is a report    
 that was in the Retford Times.        
   The Hoods that are thrown up are    
 called Sack Hoods.There are 12,and you
 get 50p by taking one to the local    
 pub.There is another Hood,called the  
 Sway Hood.That is thrown up,and a     
 scrum is formed to push it to 2       
 different pubs.                       
   The songs that are sung are:_'John  
 Barleycorn','Farmers Boy',and         
 'Canons.'                             
   The clothes that the Lord of the    
 Boggins wear are a hat,with artificial
 flowers on,and a red hunting coat.    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
