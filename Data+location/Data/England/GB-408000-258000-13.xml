		<title>13Kinwarton Dovecote</title>
		<content>      The 14th Century Dovecote at     
 Kinwarton is circular with a conical  
 roof and is about 25 feet high.       
      Inside there are 580 nest holes  
 and little perches all the way round  
 for the pigeons to land on before     
 going into their holes.               
      When you go inside it is very    
 dark. When your eyes get accustomed   
 to it you can see that there are quite
 small holes all the way round for the 
 pigeons to nest in.                   
      In the middle there is a long    
 pole. Attached to it is a ladder which
 can swing round so that the person up 
 it could reach every nest-hole to see 
 if there were any eggs or chicks.     
      The Dovecote is owned and        
 maintained by the National Trust. An  
 entrance key can be obtained from     
 Glebe Farm, Kinwarton.
