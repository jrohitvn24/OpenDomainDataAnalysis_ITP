		<title>16TRANSPORT IN BRENTWOOD</title>
		<content>  The town has good road and rail      
 communications. 3km west of the town  
 centre is a large interchange where   
 the M25 (London Orbital Motorway)     
 crosses the A12 London to Chelmsford  
 road which by-passes Brentwood. A     
 survey of traffic was taken at        
 1100-1115 on Wednesday 5th June 1985  
            {Cars  Lorries/Coaches}    
{M25 South}   316        168           
{    North}   225        187           
                                       
{A12 West}    226        117           
{    East}    196        114           
  The station was opened in 1840. About
 200 trains run per day. It takes 19   
 minutes on a fast train to get to     
 London. Because of heavy traffic in   
 London the car journey is very slow.  
 Users complained of dirty trains, poor
 service and high prices.There are also
 services to Chelmsford and Southend.  </content>
