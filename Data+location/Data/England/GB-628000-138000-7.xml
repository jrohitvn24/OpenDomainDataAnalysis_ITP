		<title>07THE WHITE CLIFFS</title>
		<content>  These are one of Dover's most famous 
 features.The cliffs were built up     
 between seventy and one hundred       
 million years ago, during the upper   
 Cretaceous period. They consist of    
 porous sedimentary rocks, which are   
 easily eroded by the sea. Many fossils
 can still be found in the cliff rock. 
                                       
 The cliffs are three hundred and      
 seventy five feet high, and fall away 
 steeply into the Straits of           
 Dover. They are continued in France by
 Camp Blanc Nez - near to Boulogne.    
                                       
                                       
 They are in a good strategic position 
 overlooking the channel, and this is  
 why Dover castle and the Roman Pharos 
 were built there.
