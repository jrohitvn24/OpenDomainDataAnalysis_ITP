 The countryside around Bruton is very 
 beautiful and peaceful.There are many 
 farms dotted here and there that make 
 the countryside seem much prettier.   
     The two woods,Pink Wood and Cogley
 Wood are different,Pink Wood is       
 coniferous and Cogley Wood is         
 dominantly deciduous.The River Brue   
 twists silently beside the railway    
 track which leads to Bruton.          
     There are many flowers which light
 up the hedges and fields.The farmland 
 is used for rough grazing,pasture and 
 some crops.There are marvellous views 
 of fields,hills,streams,valleys and   
 farms.                                
    There is a dam (which is part of   
 the flood relief scheme)to lead the   
 water onto another course and prevent 
 flooding.                             
    We are lucky to live in this area. </content>
