		<content> The area is rich in farmhouses of     
 interest to students of mediaeval and 
 Tudor architecture.The most important 
 is {Stiniel,}meaning Stonehall,thought
 to mark the transition in building    
 technique from turf and timber to     
 granite.It is recorded in 1224 and is 
 little altered except for an added    
 fireplace.{Lower Jurston }is thought  
 to date from the same period, thatched
 and with an unspoilt interior.{Upper  
{Horselake}was probably a mediaeval    
 barn-house, the original timbers may  
 still be seen below Tudor             
 additions.Bedrooms and staircase were 
 added in the 16th.C. {Lettaford,Hole  
{and Collihole}are houses of note and  
 two former longhouses exist at {      
{Middlecott }site of a manor in        
 Domesday 1086, each has superb        
 fireplaces and a bread oven.
