Most of the people we were able to talk
belong to the Church of England. They  
said that most of the villagers were   
also Church of England but that very   
few of them actually bothered to go to 
church on a regular basis. Some of the 
churches have such a small congregation
that they have to share a vicar with an
other church. There are also members of
some of the other christian faiths such
as Catholics and Baptist but they have 
tavel out of the area to go to church.
