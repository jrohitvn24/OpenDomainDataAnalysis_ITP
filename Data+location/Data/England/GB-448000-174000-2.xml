		<title>02The M4 And World's End</title>
		<content> The M4 is the busiest route in Europe.
 People go from the area to London,    
 Swindon and Basingstoke by the M4 and 
 people drive to the area. Also trucks 
 pass through the area to reach the    
 motorway and exit 13 is just 2km away.
 It has releaved the local road from   
 commuters to the larger towns and     
 cities. It has created trade, but has 
 also removed some. It has made easy   
 access to destinations.               
    Some people believe it does not    
 affect their lives at all: though some
 people think it causes a certain      
 amount of pollution. Residents often  
 complain of noise when the wind is    
 blowing their way.
