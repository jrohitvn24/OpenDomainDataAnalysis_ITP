		<title>12Leisure Activities</title>
		<content> There are plenty of leisure activities
 to do in Elston.Every Tuesday I go    
 dancing in the hall with Mrs          
 Elston.There is a pony club which lots
 of girls go to.Every Friday there is a
 roller disco at the village hall,its  
 Â£1.00 for an hour and a free  packet  
 of crisps, but more people go to      
 Bingham skating because the floor is  
 much bigger and its only Â£1.00 for an 
 hour and a half.I go shopping every   
 Saturday with my family for clothes   
 and things.There are plenty of long   
 walks about Elston.Some boys go       
 fishing at Car Dike bridge.Boys with  
 Bmx's go to a Bmx track at Farndon or 
 Newark.Somestimes I help mum do the   
 cleaning or hoovering and sometimes   
 peal the potatoes.Children go to the  
 shop for sweets.There is a pub,some   
 new people have moved in so now a lot 
 more people go for a drink.           </content>
