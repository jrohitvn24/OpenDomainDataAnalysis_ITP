		<title>20HOLIDAYS FROM BLACKBURN</title>
		<content>      Most people spend at least 2     
 weeks of the year away from home on   
 holiday. In Blackburn many people     
 take the 2 weeks at the end of July   
 and the beginning of August, this is  
 a tradition dating back to Victorian  
 times, when all cotton mills in the   
 area shut for this fortnight.         
      Holidays today can either        
 be taken in Britain or abroad. If     
 staying in Britain many people head   
 for the South coast where there is the
 chance of warmer weather. For a       
 quieter holiday many go to the upland 
 areas of the North, for example the   
 Lake District.                        
      If going abroad most Blackburn   
 people travel to the Mediterranean    
 countries, North Africa or North      
 America. A few people might go to     
 places, such as Asia and South America
 but usually these are too expensive.  </content>
