		<title>10A Message To The Future</title>
		<content>I hope there will be less unemployment 
in the world in the future although I  
think there will be more.I also hope   
that in Ethiopia there will be no      
famine unlike today.Today thousands of 
people even young children die of      
starvation or diseases.A few weeks ago 
an American T.W.A. plane was hijacked. 
The hijackers did this because they    
wanted 324 of their own people back    
from the Americans and the Israelies.  
There have been bombs dropped or       
planted by the I.R.A. They have been   
doing this because they think that     
Northern Ireland should be able to have
it's own government and not be part of 
the United Kingdom. I hope that in     
about 50-100 years everything in our   
world will be better and it will be a  
nicer place to live in.
