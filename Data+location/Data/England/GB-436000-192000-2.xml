		<content>The village of Lyford was previously   
Lingford, meaning "the ford by which   
flax grew". No such crop is grown today
but wild flax maybe found on wet areas 
fringing the river.                    
The River Ock derives its name from the
pre-Saxon word "Ock" meaning a young   
salmon. Due to heavy pollution of the  
Thames salmon has not been seen since  
the turn of the century.               
The meaning of "Charney Bassett" is    
"Cearn-isle" or the island beside the  
river Cearn or Charn, a Celtic name    
forthe River Ock. Bassett comes from   
the Norman family of Ralph Bassett who 
held land in the district.             
The names of 2 fields near Charney     
Bassett, are "Clover Ground" and       
"Nightlie", which probably originate   
from the days of common grazing.
