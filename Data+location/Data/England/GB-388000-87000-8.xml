		<title>08GAMES IN THE PLAYGROUND - 1</title>
		<content> In all parts of the{country}children  
 play games at breaktime in the school 
 playground.  The games played are the 
 same in various areas but have        
 different names.  Here is a selection 
 of games described by some six year   
 olds from Mrs. Baker's set.  Some are 
 seasonal games, but most are playes   
 all the year round.                   
{Hopscotch} A squared shape is drawn on
 the ground and numbered from 1 to 10. 
 Any number of children can play. A    
 stone is thrown on to a numbered      
 square and the child has to hop and   
 skip along the squares and pick up the
 stone.  If the stone lands on the     
 wrong number or the child loses       
 balance and fails to pick up the      
 stone, then the child is out of the   
 game.                                 
{Chase} This game is known by several  
 different names.                      </content>
