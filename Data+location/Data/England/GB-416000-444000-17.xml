		<title>17CRAFTS IN THE OLD MILLS</title>
		<content>   The older industries in Otley and   
 the district were mainly textiles and 
 engineering, with some paper          
 manufacture. These have now closed    
 down.One of the old mills, called     
 Otley Mills, is on the Ilkley road,   
 and it has now been developed into a  
 lot of workshops. One of them makes   
 furniture by hand, and the things they
 make are very expensive and high      
 quality. Another one is run by a man  
 who makes pianos. There is also a shop
 selling camping and outdoor things.   
   Prince Henry's Grammar School runs  
 some night classes for people who     
 want to learn new craft skills, and   
 these are quite well attended. A lot  
 of people think that crafts are a good
 thing for today because they help you 
 to relax.
