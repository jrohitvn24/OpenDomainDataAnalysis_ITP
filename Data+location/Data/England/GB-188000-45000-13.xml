		<content> TREWITHEN ESTATE.                     
 Trewithen Estate is much smaller now  
 than in its heyday,but it still       
 consists of about 10,000 acres.1,500  
 acres are farmed directly by the      
 estate the rest is leased.Farming     
 methods have changed since the Second 
 World War:winter corn has been        
 introduced &amp; as grass is the best crop
 to grow in Cornwall,a balance is made 
 between corn &amp; cattle.Other new crops 
 are being introduced eg.oil seed rape,
 which is used for cooking oil &amp;       
 margarine.Trewithen has always led the
 way in new farming techniques:the     
 first steam threshing machine to be   
 used in Cornwall was here,&amp; nowadays  
 computers have been introduced for    
 stock taking etc.The owner believes   
 that tradition gives a degree of      
 stability but it must not stifle      
 good,new ideas.                       </content>
