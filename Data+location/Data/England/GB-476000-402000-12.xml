		<title>12Epworth - by a Newcomer.</title>
		<content>    I have only been here in Epworth   
 for four months after being abroad    
 for most of my life.I didn't expect   
 Epworth would be this nice.I like the 
 people here and I have already made   
 lots of friends.Although it is a big  
 village,everyone seems to know        
 everyone else.                        
    I think it is a well laid out      
 village and there are many            
 historic buildings to see.There is a  
 new leisure centre here but it doesn't
 have a swimming pool.This is one thing
 which I would like to see built in the
 future.
