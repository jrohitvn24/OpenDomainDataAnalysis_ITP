		<title>09"ONE DAY" by a COLYTON child</title>
		<content>  On a normal week day, I wake up about
 7.30a.m.,and I dress, wash and go     
 downstairs to breakfast.Then I go back
 upstairs, clean my teeth,get my school
 things ready and cycle to school wuth 
 my friends. At school I study subjects
 such as: History, English, Geography, 
 Music, Art and Drama. Then there are  
 the sciences: Biology, the study of   
 plants and animals, Physics,Chemistry 
 and Maths. We also have a Computer    
 room.                                 
  At 3.40p.m. we go home. At home, I do
 my homework, which is extra work the  
 teachers give us. Then I watch the    
 television if it's a dull day, but    
 when I get home, there are only       
 programes on for little children.I    
 have tea, which normally consists of  
 bread,cakes and a cup of tea, at about
 6.00p.m. When it's 9.30p.m., I go to  
 bed often after watching more TV.     </content>
