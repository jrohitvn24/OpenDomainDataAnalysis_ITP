		<title>13 MARKETS IN FOLKESTONE</title>
		<content>   Folkestone's markets are held       
outside in car parks. A large variety  
of goods is sold off wooden tables and 
rails. These goods are often cheaper   
than shop prices.                      
   The traders gather at an allocated  
place on a specified day of the week.  
The traders often have to pay the org- 
aniser a sum of money to allow them to 
take part.                             
   Folkestone houses three markets, two
in the town centre on Thursdays and    
Saturdays and a very large one on the  
sea front on Sundays. Demonstrations,  
take-away food stalls and auctions are 
all included in the markets, which are 
popular with both local people and     
visitors.                              
   All of Folkestone's markets are open
from early morning until around four   
o'clock. Some traders leave before     
four, while others stay until the end. </content>
