		<content> The people of Littlebeck and          
 Sneatonthorpe and the farms on the    
 moors are mainly farmers and          
 agricultural workers.                 
 Most people keep many domestic pets in
 their homes, mainly sheep, dogs and   
 cats, which also give service on the  
 farms.                                
 The people also have chickens, pigs,  
 sheep, goats, ducks and cows which    
 provide them with food for the family 
 such as milk, eggs, bacon, cheese and 
 wool.                                 
 Many wives, being able to use a       
 spinning wheel, use the fleeces from  
 the sheep which they dye and spin to  
 make coollens for the family.         
 Most people own their own transport   
 which provides essential travel to the
 next town or village.
