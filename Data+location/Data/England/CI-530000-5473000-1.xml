		<content> The designated area includes all of St
 Martins and some areas from adjoining 
 parishes. The main activities in the  
 area are tourism, horticulture and    
 dairy-farming and although the area is
 rural, it is quite densely populated, 
 the only relatively sparsely inhabited
 area being the cliffs. Dotted along   
 the coast are several small rocky     
 beaches which are protected from the  
 westerlies. The cliffs rise steeply   
 and then slope into a plateau. When   
 viewed from above the boundaries of   
 the fields, roads and buildings are   
 shown to follow the pattern of the old
 strip system of farming. Further      
 inland the area becomes more built up 
 and the main shopping centre is found 
 apoproximately 2.5 kilometres from the
 coast.
