		<title>19Changes in Brookmans Park</title>
		<content>    We interviewed several people who  
 live in or near Brookmans Park and the
 interesting thing was that we were    
 told the same by all of them. The     
 village and its surroundings have not 
 changed a lot since they have lived   
 here. One couple who have lived here  
 the longest, Mr and Mrs King, told us 
 that the cottage they live in used to 
 belong to Mrs King's father and it was
 a pig farm. Mrs King is now in her    
 seventies and the pig farm is just a  
 collection of disused outhouses. She  
 showed us old survey maps of the area 
 around Bell Bar and how the large     
 estate has been divided up and sold.  
 Bell Bar used to have a post office   
 but this is now a private house.Some  
 of the land, which used to be farmed  
 has now become a market garden and a  
 garden centre but the land is still   
 basically used for agriculture.       </content>
