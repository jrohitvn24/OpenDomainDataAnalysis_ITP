		<title>18A SHOPKEEPER'S LOT - S.ALDIS</title>
		<content> In 1981 we travelled Norfolk looking  
 for a village shop/post office &amp; found
 this one;no-one could ask for a nicer 
 village shop-ASHWELLTHORPE is lucky to
 have such a large one.It's a continual
{struggle to keep P.O.busy enough so it
{isn't closed by P.O.hierarchy who also
{say,with all the recent break-ins,that
{small P.O.s pose security risks.}Peo- 
 ple's pensions/family allowances can  
 now be paid to their banks- but this  
 is backbone of small P.O.s'work.{Vill-
{gers meet up in shop, also people from
{other villages, providing company &amp; a 
{listening ear &amp; wide-ranging discuss- 
{ion!}Ash. is more &amp; more a commuter   
 village - people work &amp; shop in city; 
 younger generation think the best only
 comes from supermarkets.{In  years to 
{come will there be a shop here? Other 
{villages around here have lost theirs,
{let's hope Ash. doesn't.}Sheila Aldis </content>
