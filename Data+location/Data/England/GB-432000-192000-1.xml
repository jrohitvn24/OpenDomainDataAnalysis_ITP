		<content>  The area we are covering in our      
survey lies in the Vale of the White   
Horse, which gets its name from the    
hill figure cut into the chalk Downs   
near Uffington. It is a mainly rural   
area, but includes the villages of     
Hatford and Stanford-in-the-Vale and   
parts of Shellingford and Goosey.      
There is a church and a chapel in      
Stanford. The church in Hatford has    
been converted into a house, and       
services are now held in St. George's. 
 There is one primary school in our    
area, and most of the children travel  
to Wantage or Abingdon by school-bus   
for their secondary education.         
 Stanford is a large, active village,  
with positive links between the        
Church, the school and the community.  
Every June a Village Festival is held. 
The village also participates in the   
"Best Kept Village Competition".       </content>
