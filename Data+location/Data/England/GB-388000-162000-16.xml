		<content>   The Rachel Fowler Centre is a       
 converted church.  You can still see  
 remains of its older use inside.  It  
 is nmed after a woman who helped the  
 church.  The centre is used for       
 artistic events from local history    
 exhibitions to peotry readings and    
 plays.  It is a sort of museum.  Plays
 are often staged there , for instance 
 at Christmas there is a pantomime.  In
 the holidays a small Punch and Judy   
 show is held in the afternoons for    
 little children.  You have to pay     
 money to get in, but children get in  
 free.  On most evenings they have     
 something on.  There is a good        
 response to the events held.  People  
 can hire the centre for wedding       
 receptions and musical evenings.  It  
 is considered to be a good amenity in 
 our town.
