		<title>12AMENITIES IN TARRANT VALLEY</title>
		<content> What is it like to live in our block  
 as far as communications service and  
 amenities are concerned? As only a    
 small part of Tarrant Hinton is in our
 block we did not spend much time there
 but at least they are on a daily bus  
 service which goes from Salisbury to  
 Blandford.At Tarrant Launceston and   
 Monkton there is a bus service but    
 only twice a week,at 10 am on         
 Thursdays and Saturdays to            
 Blandford.This bus is very important  
 to those people who have not got cars 
 as it is the only chance they have to 
 go shopping.The letters are collected 
 twice a day and there is one          
 delivery.The library van visits each  
 village twice a week usually at 10 am 
 in the morning.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
