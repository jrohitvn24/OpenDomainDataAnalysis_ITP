		<title>12THE MUSEUM IN BARNARD CASTLE</title>
		<content> The Bowes Museum is an unusual        
 building to find in a town like       
 Barnard Castle.It is a large French   
 chateau,built by John Bowes in 1869 to
 keep his large collection of treasures
 .It now belongs to Durham County      
 Council and has pottery,paintings ,   
 furniture and tapestries worth        
 millions of pounds.People come from   
 all over the world to see them. St.   
 Mary's school is only a few minutes   
 walk away,so we often visit it,       
 especially the Teesdale rooms with    
 the Roman exhibits and local crafts.We
 helped to collect money when they were
 buying two Canaletto paintings.They   
 also have a Goya and an El Greco.The  
 French style flower beds at the front 
 are lovely,and you can walk all round.
 You can play bowls or tennis if you   
 belong to the club.{
