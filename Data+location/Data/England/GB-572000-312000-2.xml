		<content> During the period of the survey the   
 opinions of people, with regard to    
 current topics, were monitored in a   
 Narborough shop and the main themes   
 resulting were:-                      
{ Weather}and in particular the wet    
 cool summer resulting in a troublesome
 harvest and other delays.             
{ Cost of living}with reference to     
 heating bills and the cost of repairs.
{ Complaints}were voiced about too many
 callers after dark, as it worried the 
 elderly.                              
{ Strikes,}e.g. those of the miners and
 the teachers were regarded as harmful.
{ Crime}and the lack of sufficient     
 punishment for it worried many.       
{ Concern}was expressed at the lack of 
 public conveniences as residents were 
 often asked for them by visitors.
