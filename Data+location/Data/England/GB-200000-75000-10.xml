		<title>10BADGERS AND OTHER MAMMALS.</title>
		<content> Badgers are very common in our area,  
 the average distance between social   
 groups being less than 1km.There is   
 ample evidence of badger presence with
 "up and overs"seen in most hedges.In  
 our block, the north-east section     
 showed the most ideal habitat and     
 badger concentrations were greatest   
 here with setts well below the average
 distance apart. The farmland here is  
 not intensively cultivated and the    
 badgers are rarely disturbed.Most of  
 the fourteen setts we found were in   
 scrubland,on a slope,close to pasture 
 land with a stream nearby.            
 Other mammals found in the area were:-
 foxes,rabbits,field mice,house mice,  
 moles,hedgehogs,shrews,deer (1        
 specimen),stoats,mink,bats,rats,grey  
 squirrels,weasels,voles and otters.
