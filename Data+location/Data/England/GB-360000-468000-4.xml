		<title>04DAIRY FARMERS AND NUTRITION</title>
		<content> Another recent problem dairy farmers  
 have had to face was brought about by 
 nutrionists, who said that too much   
 fat was dangerous causing heart       
 attacks and that the culprit foods    
 were mainly dairy products. With a    
 health conscious public to cater to   
 farmers found it difficult to get rid 
 of produce and had to bring prices    
 down to compete with low-fat products.
 Until then farmers had been encouraged
 to produce cows with a high butterfat 
 content in their milk. Now they face  
 the problem of breeding cows which    
 produce less butterfat and more       
 protein in their milk. All this takes 
 time but the farmer has to act quickly
 to save his livelihood.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
