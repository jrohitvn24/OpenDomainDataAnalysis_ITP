		<title>10Shenington, Trinity Church</title>
		<content> The church was built in 1125AD to     
 1400AD, the latest addition being the 
 tower in the 15th century. The main   
 part of the church is Hornton stone,  
 but it was too soft for the tower so  
 they used Clipsham stone which was    
 much harder, but even though it is    
 hard it has withered away. In 1879 the
 Norman arch which separated the       
 chancel from the nave was moved to the
 front of the organ, so in place of it 
 a bigger arch was built. By the pulpit
 there are stairs which lead up to to  
 stalls above the old arch, but when   
 the arch was moved so were the stalls.
 In 1879, a new one built by Eber      
 Clifton, who was first to be baptised 
 in it. Outside on the south facing is 
 a stone carving of a man under an arch
 with an ox by his side. The man is    
 said to be a priest either blessing   
 livestock or the crops.               </content>
