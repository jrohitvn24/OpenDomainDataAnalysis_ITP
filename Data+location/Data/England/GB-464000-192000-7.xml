		<title>07Life in Upperton</title>
		<content> I live in Upperton which is the top   
 part of Brightwell Baldwin.  We have  
 got one church and two farms.  In one 
 of the farms my mother has some       
 calves, she feeds them morning and    
 night.  There is a pub called the Lord
 Nelson.  There is also a shop that is 
 going to close down just before       
 christmas.  When I go out I go and see
 my friends or get some shopping. Lots 
 of people go or walks and bike rides. 
 I like living in Uppeton.  Thee are   
 lots of things to o and the           
 countryside here is very beautiful.   
 In autumn the round is scattered with 
 leaves and I collect lots of conkers. 
 Sometimes in winter the school bus    
 gets stuck in the snow.  Lots of my   
 friends ride so I ride out with them.
