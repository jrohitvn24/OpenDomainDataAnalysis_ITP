		<content>      (continued from page 7)          
 No staff are now maintained and the   
 farm cottages have been sold to       
 private dwellers, but contract labour 
 and machinery are employed when       
 necessary,e.g.in Spring and Autumn.The
 land itself has seen little change in 
 Mr. McCheyne's life time.As a boy, he 
 walked down the same road to St.Mary's
 school, only now a bridge over the    
 bypass spans the original valley.     
 There are fewer houses along the      
 road,as unnecessary cottages for farm 
 labourers have been demolished.Half a 
 dozen hedges have been removed from   
 the farmland but the boundary hedge   
 between the brothers' farms has been  
 retained, since this has been dated   
 back to the 13th century.             
   Mr. McCheyne welcomes the changes.He
 says the pace of life is easier now   
 and the standard of living better.    </content>
