		<title>08WORSHIP, SOMERFORD AREA</title>
		<content>   The religious life of the area is   
 centred upon two Church of England    
 parish churches and two Methodist     
 chapels.                              
   The Anglican churches are in Great  
 and Little Somerford and the Methodist
 chapels are in Cleverton and Great    
 Somerford,the latter just outside our 
 study area.                           
   Though church attendance has        
 lessened over the years,three of these
 churches still run Sunday Schools.The 
 churches are also heavily involved in 
 the life of the community.            
   Before the State took responsibility
 for education the schools were        
 provided by churches and our own      
 school is a Church of England Aided   
 School.                               
   On the next page we will be looking 
 at the two Anglican Churches in more  
 detail.                               </content>
