		<title>11LOCAL HISTORY STANFORD 1</title>
		<content> Most of the farms still belong to Sir 
 Francis Winnington, of Brockhill      
 Estate.  The Winnington family lived  
 at Stanford Court from 1673.   Death  
 duties forced them to sell Stanford   
 Court in the 1940s, and the house and 
 stables are now used as a sawmilling  
 business.                             
 The family run tenanted farms are     
 protected by the new Succession Law.  
 A lake covering 60 acres lies by the  
 side of Stanford Court and a fishing  
 syndicate have the rights to stock and
 fish the lake for trout.  There are   
 many hardwood trees around the lake.  
 The side of the valley, called Stoney 
 Head is forestry managed by Brockhill 
 Estate.  The Church stands on the side
 of the valley just below the forests.
