		<content>  The  Parish   Church  of  All  Saints
 stands at the south east corner of the
 village  close  to  the  River  Witham
 which  passes just to the south of the
 churchyard. There has been a church on
 the  site  since  at  least  the tenth
 century the present one being somewhat
 unique in that  the  chancel  and  the
 nave are the same length.             
  The  Church no longer  owns the glebe
 land  or  the  vicarage,  the  present
 vicar living  at  Coddington  some two
 miles away.                           
  Although the average congregation  on
 a  Sunday  is  less  than  twelve  the
 church is well  supported  financially
 and is maintained in  a  good state of
 repair.                               
  The  lower  church  yard   has   been
 allowed to grow wild and  provides  an
 excellent  habitat for  small animals,
 birds(esp. finches) and butterflies.  </content>
