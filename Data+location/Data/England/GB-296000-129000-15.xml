		<title>15UPTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The village used to have its own      
 smithy but this has closed. A         
 blacksmith came for a time after the  
 last war for one day a week but now   
 people with horses usually have the   
 blacksmith call at their own farms.   
 Farming has changed considerably and  
 become much more mechanised with a    
 resulting loss of jobs, those that    
 used to be done by a few men now being
 done by one machine.                  
 Some jobs are provided by the tourist 
 industry, one farm near the village   
 doing bed and breakfast for about Â£8  
 per night or Â£10 with an evening meal.
 They also offer a tea making and baby 
 sitting service.                      
 You can also rent a holiday bungalow  
 that sleeps five people for Â£65 - Â£120
 per week in the high season.
