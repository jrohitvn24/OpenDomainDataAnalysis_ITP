		<title>12Sheep In The Wylye Valley</title>
		<content> Sheep are very important in the       
 valley.The farmers start lambing at   
 the beginning of February.They mark   
 the lambs with plastic tags as they   
 are born and when they are about six  
 weeks old they are tatooed on their   
 ears.{The}tails have to be docked as  
 they  collect a lot of dirt and then  
 attract the blow fly which will lay   
 eggs that become maggots and eat the  
 flesh of the sheep.The tails are      
 removed by using a special rubber     
 band that stops the blood.{In}May/June
 they shear the sheep.They send the    
 wool to the wool marketing board.{In }
 July and October by law they dip the  
 sheep to prevent sheep scab and       
 deter the blow fly.{Some}sheep are    
 shown and have to be washed and       
 brushed and trained to be led quietly.
{Sheep}grazing in the valley are a     
 familiar and lovely sight.            </content>
