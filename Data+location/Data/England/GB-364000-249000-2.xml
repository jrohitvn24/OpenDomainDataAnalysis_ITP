 There is a great deal of interest in  
 arts and crafts and plenty of         
 opportunity for people to improve     
 their skills and extend their know-   
 ledge in a variety of subjects        
 offered. Evening classes, most of them
 organised by the local education      
 authority, include instruction in     
 upholstery, needlework, painting,     
 pottery, woodwork, and ironwork.  Very
 skilled instruction is given by a     
 local lady in the art of cake         
 decoration: her work is well known    
 throughout the county - and even      
 further afield. Flower arranging is a 
 very popular craft and this reaches a 
 very high standard at the competitions
 held in connection with the local     
 festivals, flower shows, and galas.
