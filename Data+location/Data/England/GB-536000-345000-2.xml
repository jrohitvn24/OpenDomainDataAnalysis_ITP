{marrows,cauliflowers,onions,cabbages, 
{potatoes,carrots,sugar beet}etc.There 
 are very few  hedges and walls as most
 of the fields are separated by dykes  
 or ditches and drains.These dykes are 
 used for land drainage.               
 Some fields are very wet where old    
 ponds have now been filled in.        
 Our villages are quite busy. We       
 have{Marshall's Produce}which         
 pre_packs vegetables for many large   
 supermarkets, and a large box factory 
 called{Pearson's Packages}which       
 produces boxes and pallets for use in 
 the collection and delivery of        
 vegetables.In{Benington}we have{two}  
{dancing schools}called{'Dancing Years 
{Studio'.}The schools are run by Mrs
