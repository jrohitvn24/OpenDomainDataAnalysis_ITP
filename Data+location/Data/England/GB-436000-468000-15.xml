		<title>15A day at Kirby Hill School</title>
		<content> After I have had my breakfast I leave 
 home at about half past eight. It is  
 playtime when I get to school until   
 8.45. We work until 10.40. When we    
 start to work sometimes we do Music   
 Workshop from the Radio or have       
 assembly. Mr Hibbs tells us when it is
 playtime and when to come in again. We
 work until lunch time at 12.00. We    
 come back from lunch and have a dinner
 playtime. We come back in and work or 
 do handwork until 2.00. then we have a
 playtime and do Maths or Story. Then  
 we go home at 3.00.
