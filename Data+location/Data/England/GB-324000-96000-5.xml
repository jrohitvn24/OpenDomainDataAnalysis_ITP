		<content> as the Manor of Chinemetona.          
 The nearest town is Axminster, some   
 three kilometres away.   Axminster    
 existed in 755 and was apparently an  
 important site.   A Roman road passes 
 through the village of Kilmington,    
 although all that remains of the      
 original road is a fairly short       
 stretch which is now tarmacked.       
{The buildings.                        
 Of the 155 dwellings we surveyed, 76  
 are houses, 53 are bungalows and 26   
 are cottages.   There are varied      
 styles and ages among the dwellings.  
 One or two are mentioned in the       
 Domesday Book, and the latest bungalow
 was completed last year. There are 47 
 houses which are over 100 years old,  
 and 63 which are under 30 years old.  
 We understand that thirty or forty    
 more houses may be built soon.
