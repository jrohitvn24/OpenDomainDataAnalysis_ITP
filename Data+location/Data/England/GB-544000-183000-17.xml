		<title>17FOOTBALL VIOLENCE</title>
		<content>                                       
   There has just been a game on       
 television in which more than 40      
 people were killed in Belgium.        
 Everyone thinks this was terrible.    
 When I go to see West Ham United play 
 at Upton Park there is sometimes      
 violence there. There is a gang which 
 calls itself the 'Inter-City Firm',   
 and they get into fights with         
 supporters from other teams. They     
 travel all over to see games and they 
 usually have fights  when they get    
 there.                                
   They are just spoiling it for the   
 rest of us. Some of my mates don't go 
 to football any more because of the   
 violence. It's good to sing and shout 
 at football because that shows you    
 support your team but there is no     
 sense to  having fights and kicking   
 people for fun.                       </content>
