  One day we thought that we would make
 a mini nature reserve. So we did. We  
 are trying to encourge animals, bees  
 and birds and butterfiles and we are  
 getting seeds to grow and we are      
 hoping that our seeds will grow. Most 
 of all we want birds to come.         
                                       
 One day we thought that we must plant 
 some flowers for us to smell and some 
 trees for birds to nest in.           
                                       
 We want a wild area for flowers and   
 creatures.We will put some trees in   
 for birds to live in. We want logs for
 little insects.                       
                                       
{Tuesday 21st May}We saw two wood      
 pidgeons in a tree weaving twigs for a
 nest and if it lays eggs in the nest  
 then baby birds will hatch.           </content>
