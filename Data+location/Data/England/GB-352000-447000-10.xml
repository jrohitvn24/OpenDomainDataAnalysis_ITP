		<content>The minor road through the area is very
popular on fine sunny days in summer,  
known as the Harris End Fell Road,it   
is an excellent vantage point on a     
clear day,being about 170-200 metres   
above sea-level.Motorists park on the  
verges at the side of the unfenced     
road,from which there are splendid     
views of the Lake District Peaks,and   
over Morcombe Bay and Pilling Sands.   
    For walkers,a favourite route has  
always been known as "Nicky Nook ",    
215metres high,with a descent into     
the nearby valley,through the          
Rhododendrons and along Grize Dale.    
    The description "an oasis in the   
hills" could be symbolic of an oasis of
constancy in a world rapidly changing  
elsewhere.The character of the area has
been deliberately conserved due to the 
nature of the interest of the 3 major  
landowner agencies.                    </content>
