		<content> All accomodation is owned by the      
 National Trust and leased by the      
 Landmark Trust.                       
 Visitors come from all over the       
 British Isles and abroad.There were   
 visitors from America during our stay.
 The helicopter service was the most   
 popular means of transport to the     
 island and the majority were staying  
 for one weeks holiday.For many it was 
 their first visit but the rest had    
 been regular visitors for many years. 
 Everybody was happy with their        
 accomodation.The island was much as   
 they had expected it to be and        
 everybody wanted it kept like that.   
 The advantages of the island most     
 frequently stated were the peace and  
 quiet,unchanged landscape,the         
 beauty,the freedom to explore,the lack
 of traffic and the friendliness of the
 people.          {Joanne Castleton.   </content>
