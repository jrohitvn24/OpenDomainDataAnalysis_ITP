		<title>08The Church in Brent Knoll</title>
		<content>                                       
      The church in Brent Knoll village
 is known as St. Michael's. It was     
 built in the 15 century but has a     
 Norman doorway with a wide heavy door.
 Each of the pew ends have a different 
 carving and 3 of the carvings make up 
 a story. The story concerns an Abbot  
 of Glastonbury.                       
      The floor of the church slopes   
 upwards towards the chancel, because  
 the church is built on the slopes of  
 Brent Knoll. The font is about 600    
 years old. There is a large marble    
 monument on the wall, dedicated to    
 John Somerset, who died in 1663, and  
 his family.It is coloured in red,     
 blue, white and black.
