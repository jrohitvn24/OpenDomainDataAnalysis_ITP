		<title>15Footpaths around Swyncombe</title>
		<content>The area is criss-crossed by footpaths,
many were probably routes of access for
the villagers in the valleys to reach  
the upper beechwoods and find pannage  
for their pigs.  Many tracks are well  
documented and various associations    
have clearly marked footpaths for the  
casual walker or the more dedicated    
rambler.  The footpaths combine        
spectacular escarpment downland at     
Swyncombe with the beechwood covered   
deep folds of the Chiltern hills at    
Howe Hill, Christmas Common, Pishill   
and Maidensgrove and common land at    
Russells Water.  The beechwoods are    
carpeted with bluebells in mid-May.    
Stinging nettles may overgrow some     
paths in the summer but the views are  
splendid in autumn when the leaves turn
golden red, then brown.  The Ridgeway  
Path is now a national footpath which  
follows a pre-Roman trading route.     </content>
