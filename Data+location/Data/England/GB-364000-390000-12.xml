		<title>12Farming and the New Town</title>
		<content>   The Farmer lost a lot of land to    
 the Newtown.He has three farms but the
 one at Fernhead now has only the      
 farmhouse where his mother still      
 lives.He keeps three dogs who are     
 useful pets.They give warning if      
 strangers come to the farm.If Kim     
 barks for a short time it means       
 someone is passing, but if she        
 continues barking they need to come   
 back from the Moss to investigate. The
 farm has a 7-8year old tractor,a      
 potato-harvester and a combine        
 harvester.He also has an old balance  
 plough which he calls a farming       
 antique.He often works a 14 hour day, 
 starting at 6 a.m.He hasn't got a     
 favourite job on the farm but he hates
 doing the paper work.His father was a 
 farmer too so it does seem to run in  
 the family.His father started farming 
 at Fernhead in 1931.                  </content>
