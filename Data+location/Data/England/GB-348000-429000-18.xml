		<content>                                       
 Squares 5029 and 5129 are occupied by 
 what was formerly Preston Docks but   
 what is now a derelict landscape      
 awaiting redevelopment since the      
 closure of the docks in 1982.         
 Most of the warehouses and other dock 
 buildings have been demolished but    
 some activity remains . The oil       
 storage tanks and distribution complex
 run by 'Petrofina' are still there    
 served by the railway link whose      
 course has been re-routed across the  
 area. The tar works are still there   
 too.                                  
 There are two new buildings. One is   
 the Lancashire Analyst's Laboratory   
 and the other is a signal box to      
 control the trains going to the oil   
 storage tanks as they pass over the   
 dock gates. Both buildings are        
 pyramidal in shape.                   </content>
