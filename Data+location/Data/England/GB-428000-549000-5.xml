		<title>05BIOGRAPHY-LUMLEY BENEFACTORS</title>
		<content>{SIR JOHN DUCK,Bart.d.1691}was Lumley's
 Dick Whittington.Of obscure origins,he
 trained as a butcher in Durham,married
 the butcher's daughter, then grew rich
 from trade in coal and cattle.  An old
 panel depicts Duck standing sadly by a
 bridge, while a  raven  drops a silver
 piece  at his feet. It also  shows his
 splendid mansion in Silver St.,Durham,
 and the  alms hospital  he endowed for
 aged poor in Lumley.The hostel bell,in
 Christchurch, is  our oldest artefact.
{REV.J.DODD, Ist VICAR OF CHRISTCHURCH,
 did much for Lumley. He preached daily
 at Lumley's first National Boys'School
 and at  Duck's Hospital.  He organised
 fund-raising  for the new church,for a
 Girls'school,and later for an Infants'
 Annexe.He cared for the sick and dying
 in epidemics.  His footnotes to parish
 registers are fascinating to view  -on
 microfilm in Durham Archives.{M.Smith.</content>
