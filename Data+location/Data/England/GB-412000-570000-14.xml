		<title>14Old Railway Path/Darras Hall</title>
		<content>    During the summer months, the old  
 track appears to carry more traffic   
 than the trains ever did. It was found
 over 60% of local residents use the   
 path at least once a week. Whole      
 families can be seen jogging, walking 
 the dog or taking a 'short-cut' to the
 local shops. Horse riders from local  
 stables exercise their horses along   
 the track, which is a bridleway also, 
 at all times of the year.             
                                       
 "After breakfast I had to put on my   
 jods,gloves and riding hat. Then we   
 went to the riding stables. I rode a  
 little horse called Scoot. A man held 
 onto the leading rein. First we walked
 then we trotted but I trotted while   
 the others were cantering."
