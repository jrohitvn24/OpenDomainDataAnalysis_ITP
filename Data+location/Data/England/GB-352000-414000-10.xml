 Early English style of architecture in
 1860 by James Darlington a local coal_
 mine owner, on land given by R. E.    
 Allison Esq. The fine almshouses down 
 church lane are very beautifully      
 situated. On the campus is a chapel   
 built for the residents. The cost was 
 borne by the Darlington family. They  
 were built in 1899.
