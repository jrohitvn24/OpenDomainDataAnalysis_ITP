		<content> There is a Norman Church with an Early
 English tower and a crocketed spire.  
 The existing manor house was built in 
 1740.  This is believed to be the     
 third manor.  One is thought to have  
 been situated in the grass paddock in 
 front of the existing Manor, and the  
 other being in the farmyard.  The     
 Manor until recently was the centre od
 the Bloodstock company of the Dennis  
 family and therefore is surrounded by 
 grass paddocks and stables.  In 1973  
 the stables round the house were taken
 down along with a small windmill.  The
 house was modernized.  In 1984 further
 modifications took place.  Although   
 the Manor was built in the Georgian   
 period it is without doubt of Queen   
 Anne design and style.  At present it 
 is a Grade 2 listed building.  There  
 is also an ancient village cross.
