		<title>02Woodlands of Kent - History</title>
		<content> The Weald of Kent is part of the      
 "Forest of Andresweald".  These woods 
 were made up of oak trees.  There were
 clearings in the wood called dens.    
 This is why most of the villages and  
 towns nearby have the letters den or  
 dene at the end of their names (eg.   
 Tenterden, Halden or Bethersden).     
 The owners kept their pigs in these   
 dens, because in the Autumn the acorns
 fall and pigs love acorns.            
 Oak trees were  used for building     
 houses and furniture because it is    
 very strong.                          
 Oak trees were  good for hollowing out
 to make boats.  This was done at a    
 little town, called Smallhythe, just  
 outside Tenterden. The boats would    
 sail down the little river to the     
 coast.                                
 Oak was used for firewood.  Fires were
 used for iron-smelting and warmth.    </content>
