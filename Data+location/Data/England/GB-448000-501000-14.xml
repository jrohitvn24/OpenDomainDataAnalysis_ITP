		<content> The area, especially Carlton Bank,    
 faces conflict between those who live 
 on the land and those who view it as  
 purely recreational. The{National Park
 Committee is assessing the problems   
 associated with recreational use,     
 recently limited by fencing to retain 
 sheep. Restriction of{car parking}    
 affects what has always been regarded 
 as public moorland. With one riding   
 stable in Whorlton and others nearby, 
{equestrian damage}to verges and       
 footpaths causes resentment among     
 pedestrians and environment-conscious 
 residents. Horse owners claim that    
 metalled roads cause horses to slip   
 and increase blacksmiths' bills. The  
 site of disused poultry units as a    
 possible permanent site for{gipsies}in
 the area has been suggested and is    
 causing disquiet and some apprehension
 among local residents.                </content>
