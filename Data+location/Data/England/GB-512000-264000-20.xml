		<title>20     LOCAL GOVERNMENT</title>
		<content>    Our area lies within Cambridgeshire
 and is represented on the County      
 Council by our own Independent        
 Councillor, Mrs.Jean Willmer. At a    
 more local level Mr.Hugh Duberly      
 represents us on the Huntingdon       
 District Council.                     
    The Parish became divided when     
 Perry, with its lakeside Housing      
 Estate, formed its own Parish in 1982.
 The Parish Councils are responsible   
 for overseeing the care and repair of 
 footpaths, lighting, fences etc.
