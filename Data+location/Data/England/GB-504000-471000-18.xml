 Marbles                               
    A marble is a round glass object   
 with twisting shapes in the glass. To 
 play the game you need two people with
 a few marbles each. To begin one      
 person rolls his marble along the     
 ground and then the other tries to hit
 it with his marble. If he misses it   
 is then the other person's attempt.   
 This goes on until one marble is hit  
 and it then becomes the property of   
 the person who hit it.                
 Skipping                              
    You need a length of rope about    
 three metres long and three people.   
 Two people turn the rope and the third
 jumps it each time. When he fails the 
 game is over.
