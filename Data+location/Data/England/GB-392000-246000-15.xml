   A Day In The Life Of Daniel         
                                       
 I usually get up at about six in the  
 morning.I have cereal for breakfast.I 
 have a wash.We set off for school at  
 quarter to nine.School starts at nine.
 We go to assembly and then come in for
 maths.At half past ten we have first  
 play.When we come in we have English  
 or split classes.At twelve we have    
 our dinner and go out to play.We      
 sometimes have P.E.After that we have 
 another play.Then we have television  
 and go home.When my sister comes home 
 I have my tea.I go out to play.I come 
 in about eight.We come in and get     
 ready for bed.When we are ready we    
 go and watch television until nine.   
 At nine we go to bed.In bed I         
 sometimes read a book or I just go to 
 sleep.                                </content>
