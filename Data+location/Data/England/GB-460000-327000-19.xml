		<content> Wysall contains examples of terraced  
 houses, some of which have been moder-
 nised, and some combined to form      
 larger dwellings. There is one large  
 farmhouse of some antiquity, being a  
 listed building, but now fallen into  
 disrepair and unoccupied, possibly    
 because of difficult access via a     
 muddy yard. There are modern detached 
 family houses, bungalows and other    
 single storey buildings. Building     
 materials are brick, with slate roof- 
 ing on older buildings; modern build- 
 ings are roofed with man-made tiles   
 and occupy spare land (in-fill sites) 
 in the village. Widmerpool has terr-  
 aced farm cottages and other establi- 
 shed buildings, including the former  
 school, which have been modernised and
 converted to single dwellings. Modern 
 property is detached 1- or 2-storied. 
 All properties are owner occupied.    </content>
