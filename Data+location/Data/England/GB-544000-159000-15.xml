		<title>15 CUDHAM - CHURCH YEW TREES</title>
		<content> On the south side of Cudham Church are
two very large and ancient yew trees.  
 The female tree has an opening in the 
north of her trunk and is hollow. This 
tree has a trunk radius of up to 2m in 
some places,and a girth of 9.30 metres 
at a height of 30 cm above ground.     
 The male tree has a girth of 8.70m at 
the same height, but bulges to 9 metres
at 1 metre above ground. This tree has 
suffered damage over the years due to  
heavy falls of snow.                   
 The female was planted first around   
2,000 years ago, the male may not have 
been planted until centuries later, but
cannot be much less than 1,500 years   
old.                                   
 Because of their longevity the yew has
often been looked on as a symbol of    
immortality hence its position in the  
church.  These particular trees are a  
focal point of the village.            </content>
