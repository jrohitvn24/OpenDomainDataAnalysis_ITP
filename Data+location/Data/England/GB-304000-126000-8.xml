		<content> At Fleed Farm, there are 120 Fresian  
 cows. The herringbone parlour holds 12
 cows, and milks 6 at a time. The milk 
 is stored in two steel tanks ready for
 collection. At the factory, it is made
 into milk powder, butter and cheese.  
                                       
 The cows eat as much grass as possible
 in the fields in the summer months. In
 the winter months, they each eat about
 42kg of silage. In winter they are    
 bedded down on straw, in cubicles in  
 sheds. When they are milked they eat  
 cow cake (about 9kg/year) according to
 what milk they give.                  
                                       
 After calving, each cow will give     
 between 25 and 45 litres of milk a    
 day. In a year, they will give between
 5,000 and 9,000 litres. Mr Bale starts
 milking at 5 o'clock in the morning   
 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon.       </content>
