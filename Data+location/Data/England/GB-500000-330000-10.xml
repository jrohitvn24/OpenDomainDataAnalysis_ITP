		<title>10INGOLDSBY FIELDS</title>
		<content>                                       
    The fields on the edge of Ingoldsby
 are thought to be strip farmed.  This 
 technique was used in Medieval times. 
 One farmer divided his land between   
 his sons and each strip became        
 narrower.  We can see four or five of 
 these fields on the edges of both     
 Ingoldsby and Lenton. Each of these   
 fields is about the same size and has 
 approximately 20 ridges.              
   We have found out that the farmers  
 used to rope one or two oxen to a     
 primitive plough made of wood metal   
 and hide. They turned over the soil   
 ready for sowing. When they were ready
 to sow they took a big bag of seed and
 threw the seed around. When the       
 harvest was ready they cut it with a  
 scythe and stacked it up to dry. When 
 it was dry they threshed it by hand.
