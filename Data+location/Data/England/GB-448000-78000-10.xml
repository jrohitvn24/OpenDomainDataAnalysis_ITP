		<content>  Dawn Cotterill is a young resident   
 of Chale Green.She gave us some of her
 views on the area.                    
  Her general view is that the area is 
 very peaceful and quiet,in most       
 places.The one thing that does spoil  
 the area is the new housing estate    
 that has been built there.            
  Dawn used to live in Carisbrooke,but 
 she prefers to live in Chale Green.   
 She thinks that Chale Green area      
 will not be the same in one hundred   
 years,because the area is continually 
 developing.Therefore she believes it  
 will change for the worse.Fortunately 
 Roud will not change very much because
 of the preservation order that has    
 been issued on that area.             
  She would not move even if Â£1000 was 
 offered.She seemed to speak for the   
 majority.                             
                                       </content>
