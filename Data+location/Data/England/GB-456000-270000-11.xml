		<title>11FARMING</title>
		<content>   From our sample of six farms in our 
 km square 70% of land use is pasture  
 and 30% arable. The three cereal crops
 of wheat, barley and oats being the   
 chief crops grown with a small amount 
 of oil seed rape. Grass, swede and    
 turnips are grown for animal feed.    
 There are 3 dairy herds of 380 cows in
 all and two large flocks of sheep -   
 2586 altogether,plus a herd of 400    
 beef cattle. So it seems to be a mixed
 farming area. One farmer breeds horses
 and on his land an annual national    
 level horse show is held. This is the 
 Kilsby Gymkhana. This is a qualifying 
 round for important national show     
 jumping events and well-known show    
 jumpers come to Kilsby to take part.
