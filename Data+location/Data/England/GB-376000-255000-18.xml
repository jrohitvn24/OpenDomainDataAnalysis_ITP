		<content> the afternoon play.Usually the boys   
 are playing football so we keep out of
 their way.At half past two we go back 
 to the classroom and carry on with    
 what we were doing.At three'o'clock,  
 or later,we pack away and sometimes   
 have part of a story.                 
 Then at quarter past three we all go  
 home.                                 
   To help us with our lessons we use  
 the television, tape recordings of    
 radio broadcasts and the computer.    
   In thw sschool grounds there is a   
 Nature Reserve in which we observe and
 record all kinds of pond life, insects
 birds and plants.                     
   We enjoy music including singing,   
 playing the recorder and many types of
 percussion instruments.
