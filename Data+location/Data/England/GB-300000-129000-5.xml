		<title>05INTERVIEW - BROWN FARM</title>
		<content> Population structure                  
 As the hill farms have to be run by   
 a family unit the area is populated by
 families. Some people have            
 lived in the area all their lives,    
 however the area is becoming          
 increasing popular for retired couples
 with their own transport.             
                                       
 Transport                             
 There has never been a bus service    
 through this area, the nearest bus    
 service passing some three miles away 
 and linking the area with Wiveliscombe
 and Taunton. Around Brown Farm the    
 roads are narrow and difficult to     
 maintain. Therefore the general state 
 of the roads is bad and little appears
 to be done to maintain them. The      
 council clips the hedges once a year  
 and clears the ditches after heavy    
 rain.                                 </content>
