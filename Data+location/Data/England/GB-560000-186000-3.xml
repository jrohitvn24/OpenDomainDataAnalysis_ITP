		<title>03INDUSTRIAL SITE</title>
		<content>   There is an industrial site in West 
 Horndon. West Horndon was not a       
 particularly good place for the site  
 originally, but the land was availble.
 Now,however, there are many advantages
 because it is near to the railway,    
 M25, A128, and the A127.The industral 
 site has about 600 or more employed   
 altogether and they come from as far  
 away as Romford and Southend,on trains
 and buses.A few come from West        
 Horndon.Most people work set hours,but
 some firms  work over_time when they  
 are very busy.                        
                                       
  There are 22 companies on the whole  
 of the site. They are mainly packaging
 and distribution, but there are also a
 few  light manufacturing industries.
