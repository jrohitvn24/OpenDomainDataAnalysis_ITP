		<content> One day a man went into the Cock Inn  
 and asked for a room for the night    
 but what the owner didn't know was    
 that the man did not have any money.In
 the night the man died.Now the funny  
 thing was that the parish boundery    
 line ran across his bed.This caused a 
 few problems because the man had no   
 money and the parish normally pays for
 the burial in such cases.So there was 
 a big arguement over who              
 payed,Buttsbury or Stock.In the end   
 the parish with the head had to pay.  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
