		<title>19Living in Coleshill,150 yrs.</title>
		<content> My name is Alexander Holdsworth and my
 family have lived in Coleshill for    
 over 150 yrs.My GGG grandfather,      
 William Leason came to Coleshill in   
 1839 and worked repairing clocks.He   
 began making church clocks,in what was
 known as a Clock-yard.Altogether      
 William had 7 sons,only one of these  
 was born in Coleshill.After a while   
 business died out because cheap       
 foriegn clocks were being made,so     
 William became a Publican,keeping the 
 Clock Inn.My GGGGG grandfather was    
 Richard Pearch.He was born in 1754 and
 died in 1840.He was married to        
 Elizabeth Cashmore and they lived in  
 Workhouse Lane and had 5 children.    
         I plan to live in Coleshill   
 for the rest of my life and perhaps   
 live in the house my family have lived
 in for 6 generation,no22,Coventry Rd. 
 Coleshill.                            </content>
