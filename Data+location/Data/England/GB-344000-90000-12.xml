		<title>12Bridport's Rivers.</title>
		<content>      The River Brit, with its source  
 north of Beaminster, flows through    
 Bridport and enters the sea at West   
 Bay Harbour. Its major tributary, the 
 Asker, enters Bridport from the       
 north-east and joins the Brit near    
 Palmer's Brewery. The River Simene    
 enters Bridport from the north-west   
 and joins the Brit near St.Mary's     
 playing field.                        
      All three rivers contain brown   
 trout and are visited by migratory    
 trout. Syndicates rent water from     
 landowners, but arrangements to       
 fish can be made with individual      
 farmers.                              
      In the lower reaches of the river
 below the confluence of the Brit and  
 Asker, saltwater fish such as         
 flounders and grey mullet are caught. 
 Eels are found in all waters.
