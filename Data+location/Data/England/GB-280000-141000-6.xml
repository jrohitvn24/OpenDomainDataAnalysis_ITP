		<content> For                                   
 staghunting has taken place on Exmoor 
 for many years,and for the huntsmen it
 is an exciting way of life.For many of
 them the sport is a family tradition  
 and they love to become good at       
 it.When a young child or a beginner   
 first draws blood from an animal it is
 smeared all over his or her face;     
 this is the beginning of a good       
 huntsman and it is a very proud day.  
 Hunting is proposed as the best method
 of control of Deer as well as Foxes.
