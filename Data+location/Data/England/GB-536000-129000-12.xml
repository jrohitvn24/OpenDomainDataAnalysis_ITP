		<content> The main celebrations of the centenary
 year will take place at the Patronal  
 Festival when the bishop of Horsham   
 will attend the service and preach.   
 However, a full programme of events   
 has taken place throughout the year   
 starting with a parish party in       
 January, a barn dance in February, and
 olympic style sports event when all   
 the different sports were played and  
 an unusual ball throwing competition  
 was organised in the village lane. In 
 July a flower festival was held in the
 church and the kneelers were recovered
 in tapestry depicting scenes of the   
 countryside. Other events included a  
 harvest supper a bonfire night and a  
 pantomime. A commemorative mug was    
 produced. As a lasting reminder a     
 Cedar tree will be planted in the     
 churchyard during the Patronal        
 Festival.                             </content>
