		<content> "I was woken up at 7.45 am. when mum  
 pulled the covers off my bed. I got   
 dressed ready for school, then ate my 
{breakfast}cereal.When I got to school 
 several children were already in the  
 playground playing games or talking.At
 9 am. we went inside.Our school day   
 had begun.We spent the day doing      
 maths, English,P.E.,art, reading and  
 watching t.v. I stayed for a packed   
 lunch of cheese sandwiches, chocolate 
 wafer and fruit pie.                  
 At 3.15 pm.,{after  school,}I took the
 dog for a walk and played with my     
 friends on the village green.         
{Supper}was toad-in-the-hole and new   
 potatoes.I helped clear the table and 
 wash up.My grandparents came on a     
 surprise visit.                       
 I went to bed at 9 pm. and read my    
 scout book before going to sleep."
