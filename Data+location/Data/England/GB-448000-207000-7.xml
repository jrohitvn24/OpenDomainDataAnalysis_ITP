		<title>07    The Ferry Centre  Oxford</title>
		<content>  Many tourists come to the Ferry      
leisure centre. People can swim and    
play squash,take lessons for swimming  
or go for fun.                         
   North Oxford raised money to build  
it,then pursuaded the council to give  
them planning permission.It was        
completed in 1976,the squash courts    
were completed in 1982.                
   It is open everyday, but Sunday is  
the busiest day. The pool is used much 
more than the squash courts.It is 75p  
for an adult to enter the pool, and 45p
for a child.                           
   There is a snack bar from where you 
can view the swimmers. There is also an
extension on the building where        
community meetings are held and        
jumble-sales as well.                  
   The future is currently being       
considered:should it be expanded to    
include more facilities?               </content>
