		<title>1480 YEARS OF MONYASH</title>
		<content>   Mrs Belfield  has lived here in     
 Monyash all her life ( about 80       
 years) but not in the same house.     
                                       
  She went to school here and played   
 hopscotch on the road because there   
 weren't any cars in her days.         
                                       
  Every year the Methodist Chapel had  
 an anniversary celebration.Everybody  
 walked around the village singing     
 songs and afterwards they had a       
 picnic. She says that Monyash isn't   
 as good as it was when she was little.
                                       
   She likes Monyash and says it is a  
 very pretty village.Out of every thing
 in the village she likes the village  
 square best.She doesn't mind tourists 
 in the village.
