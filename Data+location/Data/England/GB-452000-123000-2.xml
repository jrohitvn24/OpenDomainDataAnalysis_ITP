		<title>02SHEEP HURDLE MAKING</title>
		<content>    In Colly Grove Copse, there is an  
 old man who makes sheep hurdles. In   
 Colly Grove Copse most of the trees   
 are hazel so it is ideal for making   
 sheep hurdles. It is good because     
 hazel is supple. The man has been     
 doing it for a long time.             
    Every two years the hazel hurdles  
 have to be replaced. The man has made 
 himself a little log cabin. The       
 hurdler works near the road so that   
 anyone can see him if they pass by    
 Colly Grove Copse. The man has to stay
 in the log cabin and make hurdles for 
 about six to seven months a year      
 because Longwood Estate own about four
 thousand sheep that are penned with   
 hazel hurdles. The man has used a lot 
 of trees. Colly Grove Copse is twelve 
 hectares in area. It was larger, but  
 some of the trees were cut down to    
 make more farm land.                  </content>
