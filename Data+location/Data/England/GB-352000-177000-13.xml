		<title>13TRANSPORT ON THE M5</title>
		<content> The{M5 motorway}crosses our D Block in
 the a northeast to southwest          
 direction. It was built in the late   
 1960's and goes as far as{Exeter}in   
 the south west and{Birmingham}to the  
 north east. It is therefore very      
 important for the{industry}in         
 Avonmouth and Severnside as well as   
 taking{holiday traffic}to Devon and   
 Cornwall in the summer months. The    
 motorway crosses the River Avon using 
 Avonmouth Bridge and many of our      
 pupils from Weston-Super-Mare,        
 Clevedon and Portishead use it every  
 day to get to St. Bedes. Our class did
 a{survey}from a motorway bridge on the
 traffic using the M5 on Monday 1st    
 July l985 - 9.45am to 10.15am. There  
 are 3 lanes in each direction:        
             CARS TRUCKS+VANS          
 Going SOUTH  186     180     St. Bedes
