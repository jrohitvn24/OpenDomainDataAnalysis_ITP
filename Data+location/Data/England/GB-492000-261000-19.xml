		<title>19Return of 92nd Bomber Group</title>
		<content>   On l8th May lots of Americans came  
 to Podington for a special service at 
 the church.  They had paid for the    
 rebuilding of the organ and had come  
 to see it rededicated by the Bishop of
 St. Albans.  The men had been         
 stationed at the airfield during the  
 war.  They came to our school to have 
 lunch.  There were lots of army       
 lorries and jeeps in our playground.  
 On Sunday they went to the Cricket    
 Club.  Some of the Americans came to  
 my house at the airfield because they 
 lived there in the war.  They went to 
 see a painting of a bomber in one of  
 our pig sheds.                        
   Lots of the Americans walked round  
 our village.  They waved to us.  Some 
 of them talked to Adam and Simon.
