<title>21Life in Gainsborough</title>
<content>

Gainsborough used to be a big engineering town but is no longer. The main employers were Marshalls and Roses, which have now gone. Marshalls factory is now a retail park and Roses is part factory and part housing estate. The town centre is now pedestrianised but still retains it's Tuesday and Saturday markets. There are now several supermarkets on the perimeter, such as Tesco and Morrison's. &lt;br />&lt;br />The majority of people now commute to work in Lincoln and Scunthorpe and there are better public transport links. There is used to be two secondary schools which have have since been demolished to form one new Academy (Trent Valley Academy), but still has a selective grammar school.   &lt;br />
