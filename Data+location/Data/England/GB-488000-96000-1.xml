		<content> This block is situated to the west of 
 Bognor Regis and constitutes much of  
 the {parishes of Pagham and Aldwick.} 
 Over a third of the area is sea and,  
 of the remainder, the majority is {   
{residential.}There is some farmland   
 and a number of recreational          
 facilities, including a caravan park, 
 holiday camp and Pagham harbour.  A   
 residential school belonging to       
 Birmingham Education Authority and an 
 infants school are in the area.       
                                       
 A major social feature is the high    
 proportion of{elderly people,}many of 
 whom come to retire.  Since the visit 
 of King George V, the area has been   
 famous for its mild and healthy       
 climate.  Associated with this is the 
 area's popularity as a{resort.}Much of
 the housing is very expensive and     
 there are some private estates.       </content>
