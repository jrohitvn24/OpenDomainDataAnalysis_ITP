		<title>14The Bellhouse.</title>
		<content>{ The Bellhouse}is the most interesting
 building in Eastwood village. It was  
 originally a{16th Century hunting     
{lodge}and is named after the huge bell
 that once rang out to tell the wild   
 boar hunters where they could find    
 shelter. By 1770, it was in use as a  
 farmhouse. Part of the inventory at   
 the time of its sale to the Cornish   
 family in 1903 tells of a very good   
 farmhouse,barn,stables,farmyard,ponds,
 garden and livestock. The farm became 
 the centre of the Cornish brickworks  
 for the next 60 years. Today, the Bell
 house is a{Falstaff Tavern.}Mr.Silk,  
 the present manager, has been studying
 its history and many of the old farm  
 implements now decorate the walls of  
 the pub.,with the great bell standing 
 in one corner.
