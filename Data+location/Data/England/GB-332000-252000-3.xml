<title>03Woonton, Nr Almeley, 2011</title>
<content>In 2011, Woonton remains a hamlet with one public house open part of the year, but the post office and mission room are now private houses. (The telephone kiosk and a lamp near the main road remain from the 1980s.)&lt;br />&lt;br />It is a rural area; even the main road which runs from Kington, through Woonton to Hereford, is quiet by 2011's standards. Woonton still has a good bus service!&lt;br />&lt;br />Farming still dominates the area (both crops and livestock), with some smallholdings remaining. Many people are from an agricultural background and, apart from the farms and the agricultural engineering garage, there is no employment in Woonton. Some workers commute to Hereford or Leominster, and some work online from home.&lt;br />
