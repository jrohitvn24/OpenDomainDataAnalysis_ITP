		<title>06LIVING NEAR ARUNDEL PARK</title>
		<content> The house, converted from two cottages
 beside a gateway to Arundel Park is   
 accessible by car by a long lane from 
 the cul-de-sac road between Arundel   
 and South Stoke. The house belongs to 
 the Norfolk Estates and a relation of 
 the Duke of Norfolk lives there with  
 her husband and four children. They   
 are in residence for about five or six
 months of the year, which includes    
 school holidays and weekend visits.   
 The husband then commutes to London.  
 The house is served by electricity,   
 propane gas, an aga and septic tank   
 drainage. Milk is collected at the end
 of the lane, the postman calls in a   
 van. Shopping is done by car in       
 Arundel and also brought from London. 
 The family loves living in isolation, 
 with the sights and sounds of nature  
 but deplore trippers who spoil their  
 peace.                                </content>
