		<title>14MY FRIEND FROM CHELTENHAM</title>
		<content>{LIFE STYLES.}My friend is Helen Scott,
 she is 10 years old. She has brownish 
 hair which looks as though it has been
 flicked. She has brown eyes, her nose 
 does not stick out much and it looks  
 as though it is soft.                 
  She has a nice smile which makes her 
 look very pretty. She has two         
 ambitions. One is to see the pop group
 WHAM! and the other is to be          
 a surgeon. She has quite a nice       
 personality. She isn't particularly   
 greedy or unkind. She laughs at most  
 things and does not like to see people
 upset. She sometimes shouts a lot as  
 well. Helen has a few games that she  
 likes, hockey, football, netball and  
 basketball. She always wears fashion- 
 able clothes out of school. I like    
 Helen a lot. She is my best friend.
