		<title>12CHANGING TIMES IN GREENFORD</title>
		<content> We did a{survey of elderly people     
 asking how their lives have changed.{ 
{In their homes}they said that modern  
 technology means they have more       
 appliances which make life more       
 convenient. People had different      
 comments on{clothes,}most said clothes
 were much more expensive than before  
 and some said it was very hard to keep
 up with changing fashions. The people 
 who did go to{work}worked less hours  
 but said that the work was very hard. 
 With{food}we found that most people   
 liked take-aways and frozen food. They
 don't like preservatives; they prefer 
 fresh foods. They say there is more   
 variety of foods from other countries.
 We found that they think{people}are   
 much more violent and rude. They say  
 that there were a lot of friendly     
 people before but now they are        
 selfish.      Sarita,Renu,Jasvinder L.</content>
