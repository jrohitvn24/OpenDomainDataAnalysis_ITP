      We went to Guidepost Health      
 Centre to find out how the children   
 were treated.  One four year old boy  
 was there for his eye test.  He was   
 weighed and his height was recorded.  
 Some babies were weighed, one was very
 heavy and then he was taken for an    
 injection against whooping cough,     
 tetanus and diphtheria.  Then the next
 baby was weighed, he wasn't as heavy  
 as the one before.  He did not need an
 injection so that baby went home.     
      The next baby came in and the    
 mother gave the nurse a book.  The    
 book was a record about the baby.  The
 baby's weight was recorded in it, it  
 also had when the baby first smiles,  
 when it starts to kick its feet about 
 and more importantly when injections  
 are due.  Baby's hearing is tested.   </content>
