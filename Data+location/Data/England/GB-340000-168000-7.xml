		<content> You can ask virtually any resident of 
{Kenn}about{"Kenn Pier"}and how it got 
 it's name and they almost certainly   
 will say "It got it's name from when  
 the{Banana Boats}came in." That story 
 is not to be believed it is only a    
 villiage tale, the{Banana Boats}never 
 came up the river because the water   
 wasn't deep enough.{Kenn Pier}got it's
 name because like{Wigan Pier}it's a   
 very small bridge. Another local story
 is the hangings at the{Drum &amp; Monkey  
{Inn.}Some men got drunk and set fire  
 to some hay. For this they were hanged
 and their families were deported to   
 Australlia. A more recent             
 super-natural tale is of a young      
 girl,on her way back from shopping who
 just disappeared without trace.
