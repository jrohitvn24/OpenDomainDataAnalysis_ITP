		<content> The land consists of mainly eight     
 cultivated fields.  Growing in the    
 fields are barley, sugar beet, and    
 wheat.  Two of the fields are         
 ploughed.  Seven of the fields are    
 enclosed and are used for grazing -   
 horses, sheep and cows.               
 The area is dominated by deciduous    
 trees, mainly oak.  The fields are    
 divided by hawthorn hedges.           
 Two roads run north to south.  The    
 largest is the B1363 which runs down  
 the western side of the area.  This   
 road is serviced by a bus route.  Down
 the eastern side runs a small "farms  
 only" road which serves 3 of the      
 farms.  A large ditch runs down the   
 right hand side of the road.  The land
 is crossed by 2 footpaths which are   
 very wet due to the rainly summer.
