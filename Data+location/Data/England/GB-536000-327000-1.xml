		<title>01Holbeach Hurn and it's block</title>
		<content> The area is{rural}and mostly farm     
 land.Most is{arable}but there is      
{horticulture}and{livestock}as         
 well.There are three big farms, one   
 village and some outlying houses and  
 smallholdings.The fields are separated
 by dykes or hedges.The old sea bank   
 runs through the block. It is called  
{Roman Bank}but was built by the Saxons
 just before the Norman invasion.The   
 village is called Holbeach            
 Hurn.Children from there and outlying 
 areas go by bus to Holbeach Bank      
 school 3 miles away.There are spinneys
 of trees,cover for wildlife, and      
 several ponds and"pits".The lanes are 
 narrow.Two cars can just pass but it  
 is difficult to pass a bus or         
 tractor.Most shopping,leisure and     
 medical facilities are out of the area
 at Holbeach,Boston,Spalding,Kings     
 Lynn, or Peterborough.                </content>
