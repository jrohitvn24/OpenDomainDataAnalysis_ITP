		<title>15The Village Hall Diddlebury</title>
		<content>   A committee of twenty members       
 was formed on September 12th 1945 to  
 build a Victory Thanksgiving Hall.    
 The site was donated by Mr V. Wrigley,
 owner of Delbury Hall and Estate.     
 The estimated cost was Â£3,900.        
   The Hall was opened  on March 28th  
 1951 by Lady Boyne. The name was      
 changed to Diddlebury  Village Hall   
 in June 1951. An extension was built  
 in Spring 1974. The Hall has an       
 entrance Hall with Ladies and         
 gentlemens cloakroom toilets on either
 side. The wooden floor in the Hall    
 came from a ship's boards. It has a   
 large curtained stage and a good      
 kitchen opening onto the hall by      
 a hatch. Mrs Radford holds the keys   
 to the hall and takes the bookings.   
 It is hired regularly by many         
 organisations and by people for       
 private functions.                    </content>
