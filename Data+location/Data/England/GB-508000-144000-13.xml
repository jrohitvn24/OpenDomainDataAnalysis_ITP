		<title>13ST. MARK'S PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content> The Church was consecrated on St.     
 Mark's Day l889 by the Bishop of      
 Winchester, the Right Reverend Dr.    
 Harold Browne.  It replaced the       
 mission room which too small.  The    
 Lord of the Manor of Shere gave the   
 site and Mr. Cubit (later Lord        
 Ashcome) gave Â£1,000.  The church is  
 built of local sandstone.  There are  
 several beautiful memorial stained    
 glass windows.  The wooden font cover,
 pulpit, reredos and other carvings    
 are the work of local craftsmen. The  
 church is much loved by local people, 
 many of whom have made gifts of       
 furnishings, communion vessels and    
 decorations.  This lovely church is in
 the centre of the village, surrounded 
 by lawns, shrubs and trees.  The      
 burial ground is a little further up  
 the hill.
