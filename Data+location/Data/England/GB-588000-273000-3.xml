		<title>03The School(1)</title>
		<content>A school has existed in the village    
since 1865, when the building now used 
as the school hall was constructed.    
It was a single roomed structure on    
traditional lines, and externally      
little changed today.                  
In 1927 the 'new school' was opened,   
doubling the existing accomodation to 4
classrooms, two in the old building and
two in the new. Contemporary reports   
talk of a considerable ugrading in the 
standard of accommodation!             
A staffroom block with two further     
classrooms was opened in 1950. With    
the addition of land at the back       
of the church to form a school field   
and the old Rectory stable block,      
suitably converted, we have the present
main establishment of 6 classrooms,    
plus hall.
