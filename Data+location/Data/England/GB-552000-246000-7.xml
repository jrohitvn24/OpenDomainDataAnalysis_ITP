 notable buildings are Hildersham Hall,
 Abington Hall (now the world famous   
 Welding Institute), Abington Lodge    
 which houses the local riding stables 
 as well as being a family property,   
 and an old windmill.  The building    
 style is very mixed including some old
 thatched cottages and some modern     
 estates, built since 1955. Some older 
 buildings have been updated - for     
 example,the local village shop. Little
 Linton consists largely of a modern   
 housing estate. There are two schools,
 the primary school in Great Abington  
 and Linton Village College.  There are
 the remains of a flintstone wall by   
 the High Street, together with all the
 modern additions - telephone boxes,   
 telegraph poles, litter bins, street  
 lights, bus shelters, post boxes, etc.
 all part of our modern scene.         </content>
