		<content> The first{school}in Broughton was at  
 the Dowse room. It was a boys' school 
 only; it started about 1640 and was   
 closed down about 1920.               
 There was a{National School}at Chapel 
 lane from 1870 until 1960.{           
{Broughton County  School}was opened in
 1910; it was built to hold 180 pupils.
 The first headmaster was{Mr Hoare}and 
 he retired in 1943. It was an "all age
 school" until 1960 when it became a   
{primary}school.                       
 Now the school has three classrooms   
 and a library: there are 58 children  
 on roll. The{uniform}is blue, grey and
 red. Once a year we have an outing and
 a sports day. The school hours are    
 9.00 to 3.30 and we have three        
 playtimes. We have a choir and a      
 recorder group.
