		<title>07GRETTON VILLAGE GREEN</title>
		<content>The village green lies opposite to the 
Church and was a centre of the old     
village.  On it can be found the       
stocks and whipping post - a reminder  
of past punishments for wrong-doers.   
These are surrounded by railings to    
protect them. The stocks were last     
used in 1858 for their legitimate      
purpose - apparently to hold someone   
who had drunk too much  alcohol.  The  
village green also houses the war      
memorial.  Each year in November a     
festival of remembrance is held, and   
wreathes are laid in honour of the     
people who died in the two world wars  
of 1914 and 1939.  Each spring,        
daffodils planted by the               
schoolchildren bloom on the green.  A  
bench has been sited here so that      
people may rest, look at the Church    
and admire the magnificent Welland     
valley.                                </content>
