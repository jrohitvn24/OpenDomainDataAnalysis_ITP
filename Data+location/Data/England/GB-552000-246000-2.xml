		<content> Abington Hall, formerly owned by the  
 Mortlocks, was taken over by the      
 military during the Second World War. 
 After the war it was bought by a      
 research organisation to develop and  
 investigate welding techniques.       
 Originally, called the BWRA, it       
 employed about ten people but now     
 employs 550.  The name was changed to 
 The Welding Institute.  The Institute 
 has three main functions: welding     
 research, communication, and          
 engineering. The Institute is foremost
 in developing new techniques for      
 welding modern structures including   
 underwater welding, laser and electron
 beam welding, and the welding of      
 plastics. Computers and sophisticated 
 machines, especially microscopes are  
 increasingly used to examine fractured
 metals.
