		<title>11Trout farming by R Bulbourne</title>
		<content> This farm is by the River Bulbourne   
 and was originally a water cress farm,
 a little of which is still sold direct
 to the public. The family bought the  
 farm about 120 years ago. In the      
 1890's the owner's grandfather pur    
 down 15 wells to provide running water
 for the cress. These now feed 15 tanks
 which vary between 6 and 10 ft deep.  
 Trout farming was started 8 years ago 
 and both rainbow and brown trout are  
 raised together with carp. They spawn 
 their own trout but not carp as yet.  
 The trout are usually killed and sold 
 when they weigh \-1\lbs. Excess trout 
 are smoked. The fish are sold direct  
 from the farm. The fish are fed on    
 high protein pellets. Rainbow trout   
 costs about Â£1.20 plb and brown about 
 Â£1.40. This varies according to feed  
 prices.
