 players.Four boys move in a dodging   
 movement in front of the school wall.

 they score a hit the thrower swaps    
 places with the "Target".

 in Team A to a player in Team B using 
 his hand.Ball is allowed to bounce and
 returned to other side.Game continues 
 till ball is missed or out of play.The
 winning hit scores one.Team wins when 
 they score ten first.

 rest of the group run along the lines 
 (grids marked on playground).If you

 then become "IT">                     </content>
