		<content> We asked people of different ages what
 they thought of entertainment in the  
 area.Most thought there was plenty to 
 do and many places outside the area   
 which are easy to reach,including     
 London.In the area there are Play     
 Groups,Brownies,Guides,Cubs,Scouts,   
 Youth club,Squash,Cricket,Football,   
 horse riding,BMX track,aerobics,      
 gymnastics, fishing,boating, dancing, 
 library,cinema,theatre, Bingo and     
 pubs. Chalvey and Upton have the      
 fewest facilities.                    
  We visited the Theatre Royal in      
 Windsor Famous actors in popular plays
 perform there.The theatre puts on 14/ 
 15 productions a year and can seat 600
 people.We saw the workshops where the 
 scenery is made,the dressmakers room  
 where there were hundreds of hats and 
 dresses,the computer controlled stage 
 lights and the dressing rooms.        </content>
