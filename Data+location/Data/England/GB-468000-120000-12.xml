		<title>12VEGETATION AND LAND USE</title>
		<content> The natural vegetation of this area   
 has been greatly altered by human     
 activity.Once forested,this area today
 has been cleared of trees and the     
 present scattered woodland (both      
 deciduous and coniferous) planted as a
 crop.Only on Butser Hill is there any 
 climax vegetation - the secondary     
 climax of yew woodland,which is rare  
 as it is poisionous to animals.For    
 many centuries the chalk downland was 
 covered by grass and grazed by sheep; 
 today apart from the steep slopes,the 
 pasture has been ploughed up and the  
 land used for arable crops such as    
 rape,broad beans and wheat.Such       
 intensive farming ('AGRIBUSINESS') has
 led to  the removal of hedgerows,     
 changing the look of the landscape and
 resulting in new problems such as soil
 erosion.
