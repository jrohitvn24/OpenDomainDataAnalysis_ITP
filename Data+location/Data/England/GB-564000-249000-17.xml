		<title>17The welfare of Thurlow</title>
		<content> The population of Little Thurlow is   
 approx 190 and Great Thurlow 180. The 
 biggest age group seems to be between 
 50 &amp; 60 and the smallest the under    
 10s. About half the population was    
 born here. Doctors and dentists are   
 based in Haverhill but a Monday       
 village surgery is held where about 20
 patients from Thurlow and Bradley     
 attend. A day care centre for the     
 housebound adn infirm is available in 
 Haverhill with door to door service   
 but currently no-one from the area    
 attends. A police officer based at    
 Haverhill visits several times a week 
 both day and night, and attends Parish
 Council meetings and visits the       
 school. The incidence of crime or     
 disturbance here is very low mainly   
 limited to the odd bicycle thrown in  
 the river or a late night driver      
 colliding with a tree.                </content>
