		<content> Population is sparse as basically     
 there are only 8 dwellings near North 
 Stow Hall. The Hall is now a small    
 mixed farm with 2 cows, 30 sheep and  
 horses for riding, but the owner has  
 recently ventured to plant a vineyard,
 the success of which is unknown. The  
 semi-detached houses have piped water 
 and mains electricity and a gamekeeper
 lives in one of them. The shooting    
 rights are leased out privately but   
 the F.C. still manages the trees but  
 with consideration for coverts for    
 game bird rearing.There is another row
 of 3 single storey cottages, one of   
 which is a weekend home. The data     
 countshows the lack of amenities;     
 shops, schools, etc. are in Culford   
 and Brandon, at least 5-7 miles away.
