		<title>06FARMING AROUND SOUTHWELL (3)</title>
		<content> Many farmers have small modern{houses,
 unrecognisable s a farmhouse, right   
 away from the farm itself. Even the   
 old traditional farmhouses are nearly 
 all modernised and up to date with all
{modern conveniences,}such as washing  
 machines, dishwashers, deepfreezers,  
 microwave ovens, central heating      
 etc. The modern farmhouse has, in     
 fact, characteristics of an ordinary  
 home.                                 
    When visiting a farm, I saw in a   
 storehouse a fantastic pile of{grain  
 many feet high. They say that there is
 a shortage of grain, but with this    
 amount I thought that this was pretty 
 amazing.  When I cycled round the     
 farms, I could see that it was bad    
 year for the farmer because the crops 
 were flattened by the strong winds and
 wet{weather.                          
                                       </content>
