		<title>12A Day In the Life of ...</title>
		<content>   The afternoon usually starts of with
 finishing off any outstanding work    
 from the morning.I do not much like   
 going into the class in the afternoon,
 but I end up enjoying it.For the rest 
 of the afternoon we do art,project    
 work and physical education.At 2:15pm 
 we have a break for fifeteen minutes. 
 We go home at about 3:32pm.I like     
 going into the playground after       
 school,but I do not like walking      
 home,or having a snack when I get     
 home.When I am home I usualy watch    
 televisionuntil about 5:30pm.I enjoy  
 relaxing and watching television and I
 really love going swimming at 6:00pm. 
 When I get home after swimming I have 
 my supper.Then I have to go to bed    
 which I do not like it does give me a 
 chance to read though which is my     
 greatest pleasure.I often sneek into  
 my brothers room and tell him stories.</content>
