		<content>  The Weald Squash and Tennis Club,    
 Hassocks, draws most of its           
 membership from Hassocks, Burgess     
 Hill and Hurstpierpoint. It is the    
 main{raquet sporting club}in the area.
 There are about fifteen tennis courts,
 (ten grass, five all weather), and    
 four squash courts. Adults can play in
 the Internal Leagues against others   
 of a similar standard, and children   
 can play on Saturday afternoons. This 
 period of time is called Junior Squash
 and there are leagues too. There are  
 family bar_b_ques and often discos and
 other social functions in the bar     
 upstairs. In the club house there are 
 facilities for darts, pool and        
 table_tennis.
