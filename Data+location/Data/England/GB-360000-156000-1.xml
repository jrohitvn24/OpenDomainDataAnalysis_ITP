		<title>01Cameley Vale Landscape</title>
		<content> The landscape is mainly enclosed grass
 land,but woodland dominates the n.e.  
 corner.The busy Bristol_Wells road    
 runs north_south through the middle of
 the area.The roar of its traffic is   
 soon muffled by the hedgerows of the  
 beautiful Cam valley.                 
 The village of Temple Cloud is the    
 only large settlement.The highest land
 is in the n.w where Rhaetic/Lias rises
 to 160m.To the n.e is a faulted block 
 of Coal Measures which falls sharply  
 to the Keuper marl in the south.      
 Light industry is scattered through   
 the e. of the area.In addition to     
 information about industry and        
 settlement in Cameley and Temple Cloud
 the following pages discuss recreation
 and local history,particularly the    
 'treasure' of Cameley Church and      
 associations of the area with the     
 Knights Templar.                      </content>
