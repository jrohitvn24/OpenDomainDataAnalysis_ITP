		<title>06Hosiery Industry-Shepshed</title>
		<content>   The name{Shepshed}means{"hill where 
{sheep graze".}The sheep produced wool 
 which the villagers used to knit      
{stockings.}At first they were made by 
 hand, but in 1589 a{knitting frame    
 was invented. They did not have       
 factories in those days, so each house
 had a{workshop}to put the frame in. We
 can still see some of these today in  
 people's gardens. The whole  family   
 would  have had to work, and the pay  
 was very poor. By the nineteenth      
 century{hosiery factories}were being  
 built. Gradually the frames developed,
 becoming better and faster.{Man-made  
{fibres}led to a fall in demand for    
 hose, but the Shepshed factories were 
 adapted to make other knitwear.       
 Hosiery is still important to Shepshed
 today, with Mansfield, Charterhouse   
 and many other smaller firms.
