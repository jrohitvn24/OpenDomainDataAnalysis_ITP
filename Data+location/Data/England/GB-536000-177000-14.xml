		<title>14MY LAST YEAR AT SAINT JOSEPH</title>
		<content> I enjoyed every year at st joseph,s   
primary school in the fourth year.I had
alot of fun then with my friends and   
teachers.Although we did alot of work, 
there were many privileges.my          
favourites were when i went on school  
journey and had our leavers party.In   
the third and fourth year each class   
goes on school journey. the prices are 
very reasonable, and the teachers do   
lot of organisation for the trips.I    
especially liked the trip to weston-   
super-mare where we stayed in a hotel  
by the beach.Every day we went out and 
the teachers always supervised us.Even 
when our class got prizes for certain  
achievements.The leavers party was also
a great success.We had a disco and all 
our families were invited.Our head made
made a speech showing her appreciation.
