		<content> At about 7.30 I get up, wash, put on  
 my school uniform and have some cereal
 for my breakfast. At 8.35 I cycle to  
 school with my sister Donna. I go in  
 to my classroom at 8.45. During the   
 morning I have Assembly to sing hymns 
 and pray, have English lessons, have a
 break and go back in at 10.45 to do my
 maths. After having a nice hot dinner 
 at 12.00 I go out for another break. I
 go into school again at 1.05. In the  
 afternoon I have geography, history or
 science lessons. At 3.05 I leave      
 school with my sister and bike home. I
 do my homework before having my tea at
 5.00. Then I usually watch T.V. for a 
 while or listen to my personal stereo.
 At 7.00 I have a wash and at 8.00 I   
 eat my supper and then go and snuggle 
 between the bed-sheets at 8.30.
