		<title>13CHANGE IN HARDWICK</title>
		<content> After the 1939-1945 war the soldiers  
 were given a bit of land and a railway
 carriage.The only way to get water was
 by the pump.The soldiers used to      
 collect the water in buckets and drag 
 it home.Not only no water but there   
 was no electricity or gas either.The  
 oldest houses are mostly down Hall -  
 Drive.Since the 1939 - 1945 war lots  
 of cramped ugly houses have been built
 .Not only have the houses changed but 
 the amount of people in Hardwick has  
 too.In 1945 there was 120 people      
 living in Hardwick.The village has    
 changed alot since then.There are now 
 about 1750 people that live in        
 Hardwick .The village used to be a    
 few houses and fields. There used to  
 be four roads in Hardwick now there   
 are over 50 in the housing estates.   
 Hardwick houses nowadays all look the 
 same.                                 </content>
