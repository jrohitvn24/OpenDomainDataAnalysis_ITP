		<content>{THE CARNIVAL }                        
 Every year we have a carnival in      
 Thornbury. First of all there is a    
 procession of floats and people in    
 fancy dress through the main streets  
 of the town. The carnival itself is   
 held at Mundy Playing Fields and there
 are lots of games to play and sweets  
 and things to buy. There are also     
 entertainments, usually of displays   
 and people doing stunts. This year    
 there was a free-fall parachute jump.
