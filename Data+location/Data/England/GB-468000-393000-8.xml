		<content> One of the games children play at     
 Misson School is :-Catch, Catch is    
 when you have so many people standing 
 in a circle or a square and the person
 who has the ball throws it to the next
 person standing by them ,then that    
 person throws it to the next and it   
 carries on around the circle or       
 square. If you drop the ball you stand
 on one leg but if you catch it again  
 you can stand on two feet again. Tig  
 is a game we play as well. Tig is when
 somebody is on and they try to touch a
 person when they are on. Tiggy        
 Scarecrow is something similar to Tig.
 Someone is on and they try to touch a 
 person then that person stands in that
 spot and she stands with her legs open
 and her asrms spread out and another  
 person has to go under the arms and   
 that other person is set free. If you 
 are tug three times you are on.       </content>
