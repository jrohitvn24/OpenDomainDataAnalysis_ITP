		<content> IN 1086 THE DOMESDAY SURVEY STARTED,  
 THEY GAVE OUT SHEETS OF PAPER AND THE 
 PEOPLE WHO OWNED THE HOUSE HAD TO     
 WRITE WHO WAS IN THE HOUSE, HOW OLD   
 THEY WERE, HOW MUCH THEY EARNED A WEEK
 AND ALSO WHAT THEY OWNED.             
                                       
 GREAT BOWDEN WAS JUST ONE OF THE MANY 
 VILLAGES THAT DID THE DOMESDAY SURVEY.
 GREAT BOWDEN IS MUCH BIGGER THAN IT   
 WAS IN THE LAST CENTURY.SOME HOUSES   
 ARE STILL STANDING THAT WERE BUILT IN 
 THE LATE 1600'S.WE HAVE ALSO GOT THREE
 BAKE HOUSES WHICH ARE NOT IN USE      
 ANYMORE.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
