		<title>01AROUND WELLINGTON</title>
		<content>  The area is the broad valley of the  
 River Lugg which runs North/South with
 wooded hills to the N &amp; W and Hereford
 to the S. The word "marsh" appears in 
 several local names and the land      
 adjoining the river is used mainly for
 pasture and grazing cattle and sheep. 
 There are few roads running across the
 valley. Both the main                 
 Hereford/Leominster road, A49, and the
 main railway line from Hereford to    
 Shrewesbury run North/South to the    
 west of the river. Threes are sparse  
 with very few orchards and land is    
 used mainly for pasture or growing    
 grops (eg. corn). Wellington is the   
 main settlement but with little       
 evidense of local industry. A large   
 military camp (one square kilometre)  
 lies between the main road and railway
 and is accessible from both. It       
 appears deserted. No military housing </content>
