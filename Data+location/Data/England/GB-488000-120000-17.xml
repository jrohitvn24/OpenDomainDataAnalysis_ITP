		<title>17CRIME AND LAW IN MIDHURST</title>
		<content> Vandalism is the commonest crime in   
 the Midhurst area.An average of 1 car 
 a month is stolen. About 3 traffic    
 accidents a month occur.In the first 5
 months of 1985, 23O crimes were       
 reported.There are 8 policemen and no 
 women in Midhurst. They patrol the    
 surrounding areas in patrol cars but  
 in the town more work is done on foot.
 There are none of the serious crimes  
 such as rape or murder.               
     The Magistrates Court sits in     
 Midhurst on every other Thursday.9    
 magistrates must sit on a case,split  
 5:4,male and female.A magistrate must 
 sit at least 26 times a year.The usual
 sentences given in Midhurst are fines.
 They do not often sentence offenders  
 to imprisonment.                      
     With the help of police,          
 magistrates and others we stage a     
 court scene in school every year.     </content>
