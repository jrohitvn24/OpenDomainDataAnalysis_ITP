		<title>02WIVELISCOMBE SQUARE SCHEME</title>
		<content> 1985 has seen a great improvement in  
 the appearance of Wiveliscombe.The    
 Square enhancement scheme for the town
 centre has been carried out at an     
 estimated cost of Â£35000.The people of
 the parish paid a 2p rate,raising     
 Â£4500,whilst the remainder was        
 financed by Taunton Deane and the     
 Somerset County Council.The triangular
 part of the square,used for parking,  
 was paved over.New red lamp posts were
 erected,young trees planted and       
 benches installed.One side of the     
 Square is occupied by London House.It 
 was a drapers and was purchased for   
 road widening,but was left to decay.  
 In 1984/85 it was renovated and       
 converted into flats and shops.Our    
 survey revealed that the majority     
 thought the Square much better        
 although a few though it was a waste  
 of space.Some disliked the positioning</content>
