		<content>    This rural parish lies to the      
extreme north of the county of         
Staffordshire.It is midway between the 
pottery city of Stoke-on-Trent and the 
market town of Leek.In the Endon area, 
much of the land is low lying and the  
natural drainage facilities are very   
poor.This has resulted in flooding in  
the Endon valley.Recently,plenty has   
been done to improve matters.For over a
century there has been a railway       
through Endon.Passengers and freight   
were carried until about twenty years  
ago.Now only quarried stone from Caldon
Low is transported by rail to Stoke.In 
1777 the Caldon Canal was constructed  
through Endon carrying flint for the   
pottery industry.After its decline in  
importance as a freight carrier it     
became almost derelict.In recent years 
it has become a popular source of      
leisure activity.                      </content>
