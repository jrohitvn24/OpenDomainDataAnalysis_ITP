		<content>          When questioned some people  
 said that they thought that Capital   
 Punishment should be kept only for    
 special circumstances where force or  
 violence has been used.               
          Some people owned a video,and
 said that they did not use it too     
 much,but it was nice to have it there 
 when they wanted to record a good     
 film.                                 
          We also asked people what    
 they thought about computers, and the 
 main reply was that they were very    
 useful for business and in schools,   
 but the way that Home Computers were  
 used for games and nothing else was   
 obviously wrong.                      
          Almost everyone had a        
 Television and said that they enjoyed 
 watching it, but they found that it   
 could sometimes be unsociable.
