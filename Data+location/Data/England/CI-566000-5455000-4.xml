		<content>   In the last two to three years, a   
{network of footpaths}has been built   
 along the cliffs from Bonne Nuit      
 (block to the east) to Bouley Bay     
 jetty (block to the south).  These are
 part of the island network designed to
 go all around the cliffs.             
                                       
   Dr{John Renouf,}of the              
 Education Department's advisory       
 srvice, is one of those whol          
 thinks that the path makers have been 
 too thorough. They have cut paths     
 along both the upper{and}lower        
 stretches of remote cliff which were  
 natural wild life sanctuaries.  With  
 very little more thought such         
 sensitive areas could have been       
 avoided while yet maintaining the     
 coverage of the coastal fringe. A     
{public protest}prevented a path from  
 being built in part of this block.    </content>
