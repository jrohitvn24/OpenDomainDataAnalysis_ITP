		<content> Most of the old houses in Port Isaac  
 are down by the harbour and are made  
 from cob slate and stone.They were    
 made from these materials because they
 could be dug up from the ground and   
 concrete was not invented. All the    
 windows on the old houses are small,  
 as well as the doors and the ceilings 
 low.Most of the houses in the old     
 part of the town are terraced and the 
 streets are narrow,especialy squeezy  
 belly alley because it is the         
 narrowest public thoroughfare in the  
 world.Many of the old cottages are now
 holiday cottages.                     
  All the new houses are at the top of 
 the village.The building materials are
 concrete,tiles and asbestos.Houses    
 built now are mostly bungalow and     
 many of them are detatched.They have  
 big windows and big gardens and the   
 streets are wider.                    </content>
