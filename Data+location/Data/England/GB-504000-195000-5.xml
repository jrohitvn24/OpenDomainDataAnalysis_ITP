		<title>05THE RIVER CHESS</title>
		<content> 100 years ago the river was called the
{Chesham Stream,}that is how the{River 
{Chess}got its name.The Chess used to  
 have several{watercress beds and paper
{mills}powered by the river.The river  
 has{pure,unpolluted water}with{eels,  
{crayfish,goldfish,trout,water voles   
{and shrews.    }                      
 Alongside the Chess is The Highland   
{Water Gardens}where they grow and sell
{water plants and ornamental fish}.They
 have a mail order business selling    
 ponds and fountains as well as plants 
 and fish. They{pump water from the    
{Chess}for the fish tanks and the      
 plants which are kept in large,shallow
 troughs of watery soil.They{pay the   
{Water Authority for the water,}as tap 
 water would be more expensive.They    
{maintain the river banks}which they   
 own,but the Authority clear the river 
 of weeds every year.                  </content>
