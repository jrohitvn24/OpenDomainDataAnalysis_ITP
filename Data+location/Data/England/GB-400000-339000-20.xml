		<content>The children and teachers of St Thomas'
R.C.Primary School have produced this  
work.We spoke to many people asking    
such questions as:-                    
1) How long have you lived here?       
2) How old is your house?              
3) Where do you shop?                  
4) What do you like or dislike about   
   the area?                           
We visited shops and farms. We         
interviewed local dignitaries, and we  
toured the area to find the land cover 
and amenities such as schools,garden   
centres and 'bus routes.               
Using this information we have worked  
in groups to produce articles which we 
hope represent the character and give a
picture of the village.                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
