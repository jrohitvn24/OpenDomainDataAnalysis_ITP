		<title>16Brackley school day (girl)</title>
		<content>   Today, the 6th of June, I went to   
school at 8.30a.m.. After assembly we  
went back to our class for English. We 
wrote poems about wildlife as this is  
our project this term. Playtime is at  
10.45 and I bought some crisps for 13p.
After break was maths. We have been    
doing graphs. We planted  sunflowers   
and we measure how much they grow each 
day.We show daily growth on a graph.   
   For school lunch we had hard boiled 
egg, grated cheese, salad and chips. We
had semolina for dessert.              
   After lunch - project work! We have 
made a pond and planted trees and      
plants around it. We hope animals and  
insects will come to it. In the games  
lesson after play we work for athletics
awards. We have to do ten events to get
an award. Events include running,      
jumping and throwing.
