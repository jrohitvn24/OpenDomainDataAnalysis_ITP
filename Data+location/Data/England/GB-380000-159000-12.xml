		<content>  Gas is our cheapest fuel at the      
 moment particularly as, "North Sea,"  
 gas has been piped to the town.       
 Electricity is expensive but very     
 clean and convenient. Not many people 
 use coal to heat their homes now      
 though they do like an open fire now  
 and again. Nuclear Power is a         
 controversial subject because many    
 people fear that it could be          
 dangerous, not only because of        
 accidental leaks of radiation from    
 power stations but also because       
 nuclear waste could poison our planet.
 Solar energy does not seem to be      
 fulfilling earlier promise but people 
 who have solar panels in their roofs  
 are enthusiastic about the savings in 
 fuel bills they acheive.
