		<title>01MELTON MOWBRAY</title>
		<content> Melton Mowbray lies 15 miles to the   
 north-east of Leicester, in the valley
 of the river Eye, at the foot of the  
 Wolds.                                
                                       
 'Melton' either means a mill tun or a 
 middle tun - a 'tun' being a Saxon    
 word for a settlement with a woooden  
 pallisade around it. The 'Mowbray'    
 part of the name came much later,     
 around 1125,from Roger de Mowbray who 
 was Lord of the manor.                
                                       
 Melton Mowbray has become famous for  
 Stilton cheese and pork pies, the     
 petfoood manufacturers Pedigree       
 Petfoods and the new coal mine at     
 Asfordby which is 2 miles to the west 
 of Melton Mowbray                     
                                       
 The population of Melton Mowbray in   
 the 1981 census was 23,592.           </content>
