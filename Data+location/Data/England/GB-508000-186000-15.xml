		<content> I go to a school called ( Bishop      
 Winnington Ingram School.) It has six 
 infant and six junior classes.The     
 headmaster of the school is called    
 Mr. D. Knowles. There are 6 infant, 6 
 junior and 3 part time teachers. There
 are 370 pupils. The infants are from  
 5-7 years and the juniors from 7-11   
 years. Infants usually have to start  
 half time. It is a state school. As   
 well as the usual education children  
 learn how to use computers. B.W.I. was
 first built in Eastcote Road on the   
 site of an older school known as the  
 Ruislip Church of England School.On   
 July 15th 1931 it was dedicated by the
 Bishop of London Dr. Arthur           
 Winnington-Ingram. The new school in  
 Southcote Rise was opened in September
 1968. In 1981 the school celebrated   
 its golden jubilee.
