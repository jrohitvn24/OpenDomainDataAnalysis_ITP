		<content> Most housing in Hardwick is very      
 new.Over the years Hardwick has       
 expanded in size and in population, so
 there have been many new houses built.
 Houses are made of brick and timber   
 frames.Houses have windows and doors  
 sometimes they also have a porch.The  
 bricks are a mucky brown.Most people  
 live in them have young children.When 
 the houses are nearly finshed the     
 builders paint them.Prices are aprox  
 46.000 pounds for  four bedroomed     
 house.Hardwick was in the first       
 domesday book.There was a school which
 was built in 1871 for a cost of 452   
 pounds.When the school packed up it   
 became a house.Other buildings in the 
 old village date back to the first    
 domsday book and are stone built with 
 thatched roofs. These include the old 
 blacksmiths forge and the bakery.
