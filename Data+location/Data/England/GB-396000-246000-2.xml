		<title>02TRANSPORT THROUGH FLADBURY.</title>
		<content> Fladbury is mid-way between Evesham   
 and Pershore and is bounded on the    
 Eastern side by the River Avon.       
 The road through the village links    
 the Old Worcester Road,B4084,with the 
 A44 and is the only river crossing,via
 Jubilee Bridge,between Evesham and    
 Pershore.This link is frequently used 
 as an unofficial bypass for           
 Evesham,causing the village to have   
 more than its fair share of           
 traffic,some very heavy,passing       
 through it.There is,however,occasional
 relief when the part of the road near 
 Jubilee Bridge is flooded!            
 In the whole of the County of         
 Worcester there are only about four   
 places which have public access to the
 Avon and The Wharf ,near the Mill is  
 one of them.This access is a great    
 asset for this riverside village.
