		<title>06A dairy farm, Lullington</title>
		<content>   Woodfields Farm, 1.6km north-east of
 Lullington village is a good example  
 of a dairy farm. It is a large        
 enterprise compared to others in the  
 area, covering 450 acres. The farmer  
 and his son run the business and      
 employ 2 men and a student.           
   Most of the land is left as         
 permanent pasture for the 320 Friesian
 cows which are divided into two herds.
 3 bulls are kept for breeding         
 purposes. Artificial insemination is  
 also being used to produce Friesian   
 crosses with South Devons and Belgian 
 Blues - an experiment which is hoped  
 to improve milk quality and also      
 produce some good beef cattle. One    
 herd of cows is milked 3 times a day. 
 This is done to increase milk yield.  
 1,600,000 litres are sold to Northern 
 Dairies of Ashby-de-la-Zouch every    
 year.                                 </content>
