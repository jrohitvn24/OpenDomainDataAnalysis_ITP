		<content>   {Saint Peter's Day Service. }       
 The theme of this service was  "Why   
 should I be a Christian?",and the     
 young people planned it.              
    Christians gather in Christ's house
 to worship His name.Being a good      
 Christian is a difficult thing.       
 Following the ways of Jesus and       
 repenting of your sins shows that you 
 are a Christian.                      
    The Apostle's Creed tells us about 
 Jesus and how He was crucified for His
 people.God sent His Son to save us and
 show us how to lead our lives.        
    Being a good Christian is not just 
 going to church on  Sunday, it is     
 always trying to be unselfish and     
 putting other people before ourselves.
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
