 to be the pubs.There are 7 pubs in    
 Oundle:The Ship Inn,The Rose and

 Teenagers though are unable to        
 purchase alcohol until they are       
 18.Many teenagers however spend more  
 time in the cafe.They can attend      
 fortnightly discos at the Victoria    
 Hall and can belong to the Oundle     
 youth club,which runs twice a         
 week.Tuesday nights is 14+ and        
 Thursday nights 9-13. There are also  
 several sports clubs.The sports       
 include rugby,football and            
 cricket.There is no cinema.For this   
 and other entertainments teenagers    
 need to travel to nearby larger towns 
 such as Peterborough.
