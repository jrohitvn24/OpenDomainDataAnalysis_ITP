		<content> Our area is part of one of the five   
 valleys of Stroud along which the     
 River Frome flows.  On the north side 
 of the valley a large number of houses
 have been built.  There are fields and
 woods on the hillside as well.  A     
 railway line and a canal also run     
 along the valley.  The Stroudwater    
 Canal is now fallen into decay but a  
 band of volunteers are attempting to  
 restore it.  The railway runs from    
 Gloucester through Stroud to Swindon. 
 Two woollen mills work to produce     
 cloth for suits, a reminder that the  
 Cotswolds were a centre of wool       
 production in the past.  A number of  
 light engineering factories have been 
 built in the area which has           
 encouraged building of houses for     
 those who work there.
