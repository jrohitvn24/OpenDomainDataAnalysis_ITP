		<content>    In our area there is a strict limit
 to the numbers of houses that can be  
 built,because of the Conservation     
 Zones that exist.Only 3 new houses    
 have been built in Woodham,None at    
 Ulting  and 1 at Langford-This one is 
 still being extended.Some conversions 
 of former farm workers cottages are   
 happening.                            
    Most people own their own homes{60%
 in Woodham,{65%}in Ulting and{50%}in  
 Langford.The Langford figure is       
 increasing as water work employees can
 buy their houses.
