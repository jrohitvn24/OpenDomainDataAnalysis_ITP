		<title>07THE KENNELS AT KNOTTING</title>
		<content>                                       
      Mr. Bellamy runs the Oakley Hunt 
 Kennels at Knotting.  He cares for 32 
 couples of hounds, used in fox hunts. 
 The hounds have to be fit and healthy 
 and well fed.                         
                                       
      Every morning at 6 a.m. all the  
 hounds are exercised.  They are taken 
 for a walk with Mr. Bellamy and the   
 kennel-man.  They are given one main  
 meal every two days.  The meal        
 consists of any type of animal flesh. 
 This is eaten raw, on the bone,       
 because gnawing makes the hounds' jaws
 strong.  The hounds live in lodges,   
 large, airy concrete pens which are   
 scrubbed thoroughly once a week.  The 
 hounds are bathed twice a year.       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
