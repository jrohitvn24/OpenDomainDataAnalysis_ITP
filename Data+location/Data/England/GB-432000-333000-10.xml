		<content>   The{Derby City Hospital}which       
 covered 28 acres was completed in     
 1927.Since then there have been many  
 modern extensions built and the area  
 has increased greatly. There is an    
 East Ward Block and a West Ward Block 
 each providing similiar accommodation.
 In recent years many things have been 
 done to improve the standards of      
 nursing including two acute geriatric 
 admission wards and a new ward heating
 system.                               
   The{Derbyshire Royal Infirmary}has  
 recently purchased land to enable     
 extensions, costing 15 000 000 pounds 
 to begin.  This will provide new beds 
 in ten wards, six to be for geriatric 
 care and the rest for children's      
 treatment. The catering department    
 will be  modernised. All surrounding  
 areas will be landscaped or provide   
 much needed car parks.                </content>
