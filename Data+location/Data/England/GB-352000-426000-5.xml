		<title>05MY TYPICAL SUNDAY IN PRESTON</title>
		<content>     My{Sunday}starts at about half    
 past nine. I get up,get dressed and   
 have breakfast.At about twenty past   
 ten, me and my dad set off for St.    
 Saviour with St.James'{Church.}       
     We say hello to our friends and go
 inside to wait about 5 minutes for the
 service to start.                     
     After quarter of an hour all the  
{Sunday School}children go out to have 
 a lesson,but the service continues.   
 Sunday School is very interesting.    
 After it,we have a coffee in the hall 
 and people talk to each other.        
     At half past eleven we have our   
 dinner of a few sandwiches. I then    
 usually spend my time{playing}with    
 friends, or I help in the garden, or  
 walk or read.Later my Grandparents    
 visit us.When they've gone we have    
 tea.I then play or watch T.V.When Mum 
 says "Bed",I complain but get ready.  </content>
