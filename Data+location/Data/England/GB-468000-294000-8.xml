		<content>{SHANGTON CARE VILLAGE                 
    This was opened in 1973, one of six
 CARE villages for mentally handicapped
 adults in England, with cottage       
 accommodation for fifty villagers,    
 each with their own room. CARE's      
 national H.Q. is at Kibworth, and it  
 aims to provide as normal a life as   
 possible for such people in small     
 self-help communities. Everyone, no   
 matter how handicapped, has a part to 
 play.                                 
    The villagers carry out their own  
 domestic duties, grow and cook much of
 their own food and make products for  
 sale in fund-raising events. The 1984 
 Shangton Christmas Craft Fair raised  
 Â£1500.                                
    There is regular contact with local
 towns and villages through social     
 outings and even attendance at adult  
 classes to learn new skills. CARE's   </content>
