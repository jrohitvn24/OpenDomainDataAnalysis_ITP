		<content> P.C.Thorpe has been to the local      
 youth group that knows him, as well as
 to the junior and infant school.It is 
 a friendly area and the public help   
 the police. When the policeman is not 
 present the public reports by         
 telephone or other means of           
 communication anything that is        
 suspicious. There is a neighbourhood  
 watch scheme, involving local people  
 looking out for mischief-makers,      
 going on which has had some results.
