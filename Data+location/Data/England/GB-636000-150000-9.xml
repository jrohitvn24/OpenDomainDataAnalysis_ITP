		<content> We children play some funny games in  
 the playground. I've made a graph     
 showing twenty games like these kiss- 
 chase, leapfrog, red rover, orange    
 balls, bog roll, bulldog football,    
 hockey rounders. Leapfrog and bulldog 
 are the most popular.                 
 In{leapfrog}two or more people bend   
 down and one person jumps over them   
 with legs astride.{Bulldog}is simple. 
 One person tries to hit you as you run
 by. If you are touched you are{"on it"
 also and have to chase the others     
 until everyone is touched.            
 In{bog roll}a line of people run      
 around until they are tangled and then
 they untangle. In{orange balls}some   
 children get in a ring and fall down  
 on a certain word and the last one    
 down goes away and the rest say a     
 boy's name and that's the boy who the 
 person that went way loves.           </content>
