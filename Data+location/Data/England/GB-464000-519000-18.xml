		<title>18SALTBURN GRANGE FARM.</title>
		<content> The farm, situated on Saltburn Lane,  
 consists of 216 acres of land used to 
 grow wheat, barley, oil seed rape and 
 beef cattle. The land (classed as     
 grade 3 - average) has been farmed for
 over 600 years. Many of the buildings 
 are 200 years old. The coastal winds  
 and salty sea air affect the growth of
 crops and is the farms main problem.  
 Mr.Hornsby and family run the farm and
 employ a person in the summer to help 
 with harvesting. It is hard work based
 on daily routines. Feeding animals,   
 servicing machinery, cutting hay and  
 working in the fields makes up a      
 typical days work in June. The farm   
 has 55 beef cattle (34 outside, 21    
 inside), 11 hens, 1 cockeral, 5       
 chicks, 5 ducks, 2 ducklings, 2 dogs  
 and 3 cats. Mr.Hornsby is the chairman
 of the local NUF and his family have  
 been tenant farmers for 3 generations.</content>
