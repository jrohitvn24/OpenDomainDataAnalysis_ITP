		<title>08 The Hopper Oast Bakery</title>
		<content>Near Chartham Hatch is a small firm    
called Kent Cakes which makes flan     
cases and specialist cakes.The firm    
operates from the Oasthouse            
Bakery.The business began in           
1980.They supply their products to     
the whole of the UK.The backbone of    
the business is the production of      
ready baked pastry cases.The owner     
believes that they are the only        
producers in the UK.The business       
provides employment for 23             
people.Future plans include opening    
the Oast House Bakery to the           
public and  inviting them to look at   
a Museum in the top of the Oast.In 1932
the Oast had been converted into a     
cold storage building for apples, the  
first in the country(and owned by      
Arnold Fruit Farms).By 1979 it was     
derelict,to be purchased by the present
owner and converted into a bakery.     </content>
