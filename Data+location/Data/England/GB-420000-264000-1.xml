		<title>01     The Hatton area</title>
		<content> This area consists of peaceful        
 countryside.  It is an agricultural   
 area about 4 miles north-west of      
 Warwick.  There is a lot of grazing   
 land for sheep, cows and horses.      
 Wheat, hay and oil seed rape are also 
 grown.                                
 You can travel by train from Hatton   
 station to Leamington Spa, Warwick,   
 Stratford upon Avon and Birmingham    
 Moor St.  Freight trains also use the 
 Birmingham - Leamington route, these  
 are mainly coal trains for Didcot     
 power station near Oxford.            
 The Grand Union Canal runs through the
 area, quite close to the railway line.
 The main attraction of the canal here 
 is the flight of 21 locks.  There is  
 also a Craft Centre for people to     
 visit.  The area will be changed soon 
 by a motorway - we think that it will 
 spoil the countryside.                </content>
