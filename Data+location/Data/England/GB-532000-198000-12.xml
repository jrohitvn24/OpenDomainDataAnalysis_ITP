		<content> Our school is called Worcesters Junior
 School. We start school at 9.00am and 
 finish at 3.45pm. Our ages are        
 7-11yrs. There are 177 children in our
 school. Some of the subjects we study 
 are: maths.,English, geography,       
 reading, art, physical education and  
 games. We have 8 classrooms but only 7
 classes of children. Classes 1 and 2  
 are first years, class 3 is for second
 years, classroom 4 has maths.         
 equipment in it, class 5 is for second
 and third years, class 6 is for third 
 years, class 7 is for third and fourth
 years and class 8 is for fourth years.
 We have a staff room and two offices. 
 Our school is a good school. Its      
 greatest asset is that we have a large
 playground and field. The worst thing 
 about the school is that the          
 classrooms are too small.
