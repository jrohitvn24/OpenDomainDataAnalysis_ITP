    David Mills is an employee of Jesse
 Manns .He has lived in Kingsley Green 
 all his life. He has seen many        
 changes.Much more traffic passes      
 Kingley Green now .People move house  
 more often as they change their       
 job.

 faster now. People are less friendly. 
 The quality of life is not as good as

 to work so hard now.
