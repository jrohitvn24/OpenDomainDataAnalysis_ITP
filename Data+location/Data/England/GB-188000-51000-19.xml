		<title>19Ladock Woods 1.</title>
		<content> We went to Ladock Woods and we saw    
 lots of trees. We saw a nest with     
 about five hundred ants in it. Malcolm
 found another nest that had so many   
 that it looked black. John found a    
 massive fir cone and we found many    
 cones on the ground. I found the hole 
 of a mouse or a shrew. Then we went   
 deeper into the wood.                 
 These are the creatures we found:     
{     Woodlice         Frog Hoppers    
{     Worms            Spiders         
{     Ants             Snails          
{     Slugs            Greenfly        
{     Beetles                          
 We saw many plants, trees and grasses 
 in the woods. Here are some of them:  
{  Rhododendron        Leyland Cypress 
{  Mountain Sorrel     Norway Spruce   
{  Elder               Japanese Larch  
{  Lime-stone          Monterey Pine   
{  Fir cones           Douglas Fir     </content>
