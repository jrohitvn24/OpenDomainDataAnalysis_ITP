		<title>09THE CREST HOTEL</title>
		<content>      The Crest Hotel is a modern 3    
 storied building with many luxurious  
 facilities.  It is very close to the  
 M32 which leads into the centre of    
 Bristol, and so it is very popular    
 with business men using that city.    
 Over 200 people are employed with 3   
 managers always on duty and usually 10
 chefs in the kitchen.  When there are 
 functions or conferences in the one   
 large hall (which can be partitioned  
 off to make 4 rooms) 1,500 meals can  
 be provided.                          
      There are 151 bedrooms, half     
 being double rooms at Â£53 per night,  
 and half being twin bedrooms at Â£45   
 per person.  Because weekends are not 
 so busy Crest offer special rates to  
 family groups.  The Crest company were
 one of the first to recognise women   
 executives, hence they attract and    
 encourage custom from women.          </content>
