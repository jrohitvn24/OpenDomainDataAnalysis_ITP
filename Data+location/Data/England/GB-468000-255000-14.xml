 Campion school was built in 1967.     
Extra classrooms were added in 1971 and
1975. The Headmaster is Mr Derek       
Roberts.                               
 There are 73 teachers employed in     
Campion School and there are 60        
classrooms. Some of the classrooms are 
smaller and used for special teaching  
of older children. At present the      
school has 1250 pupils. This breaks    
down to 610 girls and 640 boys. Campion
School has many football teams and     
netball teams. It also has two choirs. 
One is a junior choir, the other a     
teachers choir.                        
 They have 14 computers but hope to add
more to their collection.
