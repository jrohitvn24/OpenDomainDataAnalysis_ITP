   There is no consistent pattern of   
 homelife although many mothers do not 
 go out to work other mothers do.      
   The number of labour saving items in
 the home is generally high, virtually 
 all homes will include refridgerators 
 and or freezers in addition to        
 automatic washing machines, vacuum    
 cleaners etc. There are a growing     
 number of micro-wave ovens being      
 introduced into the kitchens but many 
 fewer auto-matic dishwashers.         
   Many homes are centrally heated but 
 in addition they have a gas, electric 
 or solid fuel fire.                   
   Most meals are taken in the home,   
 but eating out is an increasing trend,
 particularly at weekends and for      
 special occasions.                    
   Pets are very populer in homes, Dogs
 and Cats the most popular.            </content>
