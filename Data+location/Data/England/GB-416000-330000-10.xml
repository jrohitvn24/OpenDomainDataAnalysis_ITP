		<title>10SUDBURY PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content>{ Sudbury school}opened in{1831.}      
 Some people's mums and dads used to   
 come to this school, we have looked   
 in the{log books}and found lots of    
 different names.{                     
 The school has changed a lot over the 
 years while it has been open.There    
 used to be a lot of children here, but
 now there are only forty-one because  
 the number has cut down rapidly over  
 the years.  There used to be secondary
 age pupils, but now they go to Hatton 
 School and there are only{infants and 
{juniors. }In Victorian times children 
 wrote on slates and used copybooks and
 were caned for copying.  Now we use   
{computers}and{calculators.} Our work  
 is about things that interest us.  We 
 do{projects. }We find out about things
 from books, paint pictures and write  
 poems. These computer entries are part
 of a project on our village.          </content>
