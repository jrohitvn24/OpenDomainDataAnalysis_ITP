		<title>04Old Court Nurseries, Colwall</title>
		<content>  These nurseries, situated in Colwall,
 are owned and run by Paul and Meriel  
 Picton. On 0.7 of a hectare they      
 specialise in unusual hardy perennials
 and Michaelmas Daisies- they sell 40  
 varieties of these out of a total of  
 only 200 in existence. Publicity for  
 the nurseries is entirely by 'word of 
 mouth', and keen gardeners come from  
 afar to see the selection available.  
 The unusual plants include Onosma, a  
 member of the borage family, dwarf    
 Daphnes, and hardy Geraniums. Over 80%
 of Michaelmas Daisies have double     
 flowers, yet the first ever double was
 developed here in 1901 and is called  
 'Beauty of Colwall'. Owing  to the    
 delicate nature of the plants, much of
 the relatively small nursery is, in   
 fact, taken up with greenhouses.
