		<title>06ASPECTS OF SCHOOL IN G'M</title>
		<content> I am an 11 year old girl and these are
 the things I like about school:       
 I like maths because it's good fun and
 sometimes my friend and I get         
 different answers.Our teacher explains
 it clearly so we know what to do,but  
 one boy sometimes fiddles and does it 
 wrong and our teacher gets mad with   
 him.                                  
 I like drama.Drama is brilliant       
 because we can act.I like acting a    
 lot.Our teacher gives us a situation  
 and then we go away and improvise on  
 it for about 10 minutes.Our teacher   
 usually thinks our plays are funny.I  
 like doing drama in groups.           
 I like doing topics.These are fun when
 you have to find out about things.    
 I like Scripture,but my best friend   
 hates it.I like learning about        
 parables.                             
 I like reading.                       </content>
