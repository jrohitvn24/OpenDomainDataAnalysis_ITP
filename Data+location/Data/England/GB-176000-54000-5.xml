		<content> We interviewed a golf professional.His
 name is{Mark Rowe}.The professional   
 looks after the ground .You have got  
 to have a very good handicap to become
 a professional.The golf professional  
 told us that he sells all sorts of    
 equipment to do with golf in the      
 shop.Sometimes he comes every Saturday
 and Sunday to arrange some serious    
{competitions}.They sometimes get bored
 with golf especially if you use the   
 same club.They signed a contract at   
 Ross with a friend.They work in the   
 shop each day and give some{lessons.  
{Repairs}are done at the shop as       
 well.Altogether he thought it was a   
 good life.At Perranporth there are two
 golf professionals.Perranporth is a   
 very popular golf course.There are    
 competitions for all age groups or    
 standards.
