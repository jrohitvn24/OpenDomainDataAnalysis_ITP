		<content>{Graffiti}is a very popular art form in
 this area. If you go into any subway  
 you will see plenty of examples of    
 graffiti.                             
                                       
    Some of the most popular slogans   
 are connected with Break Dancing,     
 like:{Hip Hop Don't Stop!             
 Many more are connected with pop      
 groups.                               
                                       
    You can sometimes find little      
 verses written on bus stops. Some are 
 amusing, some are just rude:          
{ It was on the stroke of midnight     
{ Her heart was all a quiver.          
{ He undid her suspender belt,         
{ And her leg fell in the river!       
 or                                    
{ God made things that creep and crawl,
{ And British Rail employed them all.
