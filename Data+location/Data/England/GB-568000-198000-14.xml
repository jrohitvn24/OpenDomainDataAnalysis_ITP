		<content> Early in July we went for a walk in   
 Temple Wood Stock. We found the trees 
 were mostly sweet or spanish          
 chestnut.These give us the chestnuts  
 that we can roast and eat in the      
 Autumn. It is the horse chestnut      
 which give us conkers which children  
 play with in the Autumn. We found some
 old dried up chestnuts some had holes 
 in where squirrels and insects had    
 eaten them. We found dead bluebells   
 and bracken and a lot of moss called  
 eurynchium. The wood was quiet and    
 very peacefull, we heard all the      
 insects buzzing around.               
 Conkers is a game where you make a    
 hole in the conker or horse chestnut  
 and put a piece of string through the 
 conker &amp; then you hold the conker at  
 the end of the string and another     
 person tries to break your conker with
 his and then you try to break his.    </content>
