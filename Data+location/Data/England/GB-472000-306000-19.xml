 Horses are stabled here for their     
 owners during the hunting season.     
{JAM AND MARMALADE MAKING.             
 A thriving cottage industry has       
 developed here producing preserves    
 which are sent to W.I. Markets in all 
 parts of the country. Initially all   
 the work was done by the owner but as 
 demand grew local housewives were     
 brought in to help in Jan/Feb when    
 Seville oranges are available and have
 to be washed, minced and frozen ready 
 for use throughout the year.  Products
 include- 3 kinds of marmalade, lemon  
 curd, and apple preserve and chutney. 
{DONKEY STUD FARM                      
 Donkeys for showing, are bred on a    
 small holding here. There are only    
 mares and foals at present as the male
 donkey caused a nuisance to neighbours
 with its continual braying.           </content>
