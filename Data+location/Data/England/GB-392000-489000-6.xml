		<content> There are only two rivers running     
 through our area. The shorter of the  
 two rivers is the Bain, which is said 
 to be the shortest named river in     
 England. The larger river is the Ure. 
 The bed of the Bain is very stony, but
 the bed of the Ure is smooth in       
 places. The rivers run over limestone 
 beds and, as a consequence, there are 
 many waterfalls, known as "forces".   
 The Bain starts at Semerwater, which  
 is a glacial lake, and runs for two   
 miles,flowing through Bainbridge and  
 meeting the Ure to the north of the   
 village, passing a water-powered      
 joinery workshop and a renovated      
 water-mill.                           
 Both locals and visitors enjoy fishing
 especially for trout and crayfish,    
 although, at present, unusually heavy 
 weed growth is de-oxygenating the     
 water.                                </content>
