		<title>16PEAT CUTTING</title>
		<content> Thorne Waste, Rawcliff Moor, Goole    
 Moor but is usually known in its      
 entirety as Thorne Moors. Peat cutting
 has existed on this moor for at least 
 800yrs.                               
   Manorial grants of turbary on Thorne
 moors was mentioned in the late 12th  
 century. By 1538 peat cutting was     
 regarded as an ancient custom. Even   
 after drainage of Hatfield Chase in   
 1626 peat cutting continued. The peat 
 was cut and dried by being piled up on
 the spot. When it was dry it was put  
 onto long narrow boats. These used to 
 go along the deep natural drains and  
 artificial channels which ended in the
 Rivers Ouse, Aire or Trent.           
   By the 19th century the trade was in
 decline, the 30-40 boats operating in 
 the 18th century had, by 1820, been   
 reduced to 8 or 9.
