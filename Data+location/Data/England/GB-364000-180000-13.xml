 5.30pm. We came home and had some tea.
 For tea I had some baked beans on     
 toast and then some ice cream.        
 6.30pm. I went out to play with Paul  
 who lives next door, and Kelly and Ben
 who live up the road. Dad and Ian     
 (Kelly's and Ben's dad) also played.  
 The boys wanted to play football so we
 did. After that Kelly and I played    
 rounders. Rebecca, my sister,and      
 Georgia and Huw, my cousins, joined   
 us.                                   
 8.30pm. Kelly, Ben and Paul went home 
 and the rest of us went to Grandma's  
 house. She lives next door to Paul. We
 stayed there and I watched T.V.       
 10.45pm. We came home and went to bed.
