		<title>17Transport in the Wolfords</title>
		<content> Public transport  in rural England is 
 almost non existent. Almost every     
 household has a car with about half   
 owning two or more cars. But there is 
 a small number, mainly elderly, who   
 have no car and a further number who  
 have no use of a car during working   
 hours. There is a bus through Great   
 Wolford and Todenham each day except  
 Sunday to either Moreton in Marsh,    
 Stratford or Banbury. Little Wolford  
 has only one bus per week to Moreton  
 Market, and two a day to Stratford or 
 Oxford from half a mile away. The area
 is served by voluntary car schemes,   
 where by volunteers give lifts with   
 some contribution towards their costs.
 This transport is available for       
 necessary journeys such as visits to  
 hospitals, doctors. The nearest       
 railway station is in Moreton.
