		<content> The main feature is the valley of the 
 river Kent running north to south     
 through the survey area. At a height  
 of about 150m. above sea level, the   
 valley is typically 100-150m. below   
 the surrounding upland. It is widest  
 and flattest in the north of the area 
 where there once existed a glacial    
 lake, now largely reclaimed           
 Evidence of glaciation is to be seen  
 in the abundance of smooth mounds of  
 glacial drift, both on the edges of   
 the valley floor and on the higher    
 ground on either side, especially in  
 the vicinity of Skeggles Water in the 
 east of the area.                     
 Geologically, the area is made up of  
 slates and grits of the Silurian      
 period. The many small streams flow in
 to the Kent but the drainage is poor  
 in the area of Skeggles Water.
