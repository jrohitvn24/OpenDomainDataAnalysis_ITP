		<title>07Home Life by a village child</title>
		<content>  I wake up at 7.30 a.m. when my radio 
 alarm clock buzzes.I go down stairs   
 and watch the television till the rest
 of my family get up.I wash,get dressed
 and have my breakfast of meusli and   
 some milk.Then I get driven to school.
 I wait for my friends to come and we  
 all go into school when the bell      
 rings.My teacher calls the register   
 and we begin our school work,.Most of 
 the children have dinner at school but
 I bring sandwiches.After dinner we go 
 out to play.During the afternoon we   
 have a Science lesson and then all the
 children come together for Assembly   
 when we sing a hymn and pray to God.We
 finish school at 3.30 p.m.I sometimes 
 make my own tea.We watch television   
 while we eat it and then I go out and 
 play with my friends.Later, if there  
 is a good programme I watch television
 till I go to bed at about 9.30 p.m.   </content>
