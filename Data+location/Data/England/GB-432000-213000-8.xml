Mr.Butlers family has farmed in Lower  
Farm without help for 25 years working 
from 7.00am until he finshes at 9.00pm.
New buildings and machinary help.      
                                       
Mr.Butler thinks farming is enjoyable  
and rewarding because there are jobs   
he can do on his own. He grows wheat,  
barley, beans and rape but only has    
seven sheep and some chickens. His     
worst job is picking weeds out of the  
corn and his best job is making dry    
stone walls because he likes doing     
hard work.                             
                                       
Mr Butler's best season is autumn      
because of the weather,the colour of   
the leaves, but he looks forward to    
the new year.
