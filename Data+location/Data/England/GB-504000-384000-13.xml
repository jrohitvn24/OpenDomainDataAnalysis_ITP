		<title>13Buslingthorpe Village/Church</title>
		<content>{   Buslingthorpe}is the site of a     
 mediaeval village. Opposite the{church
 the land is covered with hummocks and 
 hollows and nobody is allowed to      
 plough it.                            
    There is a moat around the Manor   
 House. It has some water in it, but   
 not very much. It is clean enough for 
 ducks to swim in.                     
    The{church}was rebuilt in 1835 but 
 the stone tower and the chancel arch  
 are 13th Century. There is a fragment 
 of mediaeval glass in the form of a   
 shield in the East window. Inside     
 there is a brass of Sir Richard       
{Buslingthorpe}wearing chain mail. His 
 heart is between his hands which are  
 protected by plated gloves. It is     
 thought to be dated about 1290. If so,
 it is one of the oldest in the        
 country.                              
                                       </content>
