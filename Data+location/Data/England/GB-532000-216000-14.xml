		<title>14FARMING at SACOMBE</title>
		<content>Mr.Michael Pratt is the Gamekeeper of  
Sacombebury Farm in Sacombe. He is     
salaried and works for a man in London.
The gamekeeper's job is to rear        
pheasants and other game birds for the 
shooting season.                       
The pheasants are kept in an enclosed  
field and the eggs are collected three 
times a day. They are then washed and  
taken to a hatchery. At one day old the
pheasants are taken back to the farm   
and kept in heated sheds for three     
weeks. After that they spend seven to  
eight weeks in the field before being  
released into the wild.                
Pheasant eggs can be brown right       
through to blue.To stop the hens eating
their eggs red plastic beak covers are 
put on them. Jackdaws and crows are    
pests that would pinch the eggs so     
there are deterrents to stop them. The 
hens are fed on breeders pellets.      </content>
