		<title>20BLAGDON, CENTRE FOR TOURISM</title>
		<content> Although we are used to Blagdon, we   
 still think it is a very beautiful    
 place. We are on the North slopes of  
 the{Mendips,}which provide many super 
 footpaths and pony trekking routes.   
 The{Romans}used a route along the     
 ridge of Mendip all the way to the    
 coast at{Uphill}to transport goods for
 export to Wales and France. Until     
 fairly recently tin and lead were     
 mined up above the school at          
{Charterhouse. Blagdon Lake}is renowned
 for the quality of its trout and the  
 guest houses are often full with      
 anglers from all over the country.    
 Although the village has grown in the 
 past 15 years, the builders have been 
 careful not to destroy the looks of   
 the place, with its beautiful stone   
 walls, covered in wild flowers, or    
 shrubs. On the A368, Blagdon is a{must
 for visitors to the South of Bristol! </content>
