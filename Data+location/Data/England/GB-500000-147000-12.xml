		<title>12Housing in S.E. Guildford</title>
		<content> The Guildford, Shalford and Chilworth 
 areas are mostly residential. In      
 Guildford most of the houses are large
 Victorian residences and some have    
 been converted into flats and offices.
 There are also some council flats.    
                                       
 Shalford has mostly Victorian houses, 
 most of which are detached. More      
 modern houses are semi-detached.      
 Chilworth has had a new estate built  
 in the last few years. Most of the    
 other houses are much older. The      
 original settlement of Chilworth grew 
 up along the road.                    
                                       
 Residential areas on the downs, like  
 the Chantries and White Lane, include 
 large houses with big gardens. Many of
 the roads are private. The majority of
 the inhabitants are elderly and have  
 lived there for a long time.          </content>
