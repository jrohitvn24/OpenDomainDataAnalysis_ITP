		<title>20Changes and Life Style.</title>
		<content>  In spite of rapid changes since the  
 war it is still possible to go along  
 with or reject certain aspects of     
 'progress'. To ride a bicycle is not  
 so infra dig as it was 10 years ago   
 since the need for more exercise is   
 stressed. Calling acquaintances by    
 Christian names has become usual and  
 seems more friendly.  The Imperial and
 the Metric systems exist together.    
  Some changes create the need for     
 further vigilance. While some folk are
 accused of apathy, yet many react to  
 life today like the older woman at    
 Standford who concluded 'I always have
 something I am fighting for'.         
  This area was surveyed by members of 
 Headley Woman's Institute, Headley,   
 Bordon, and we gratefully acknowledge 
 help from the Bramshott and Liphook   
 Preservation Society.
