		<title>18Sinclair C5</title>
		<content>The Sinclair C5 was designed in 1981   
by Sir Clive Sinclair. The tricycle is 
driven by a small electric motor,      
powered by a 12 volt battery giving a  
maximum speed of 18 m.p.h. for a       
distance of 20 miles on one charge of  
the battery. A second battery doubles  
the range.                             
When it was designed the plastic body  
of the Sinclair C5 was the largest     
mass produced injection moulding       
manufatured. The Sinclair C5 has a     
high intensity rear light and a head-  
lamp mounted in the bodywork. A drum   
brake is fitted on one rear wheel and  
a caliper brake on the front wheel     
similar to a normal  normal bicycle.   
The brakes are operated by levers on   
the handlebars, one of which may be    
locked to act as a parking brake.
