		<content> There is a local magazine called      
 Trentside Links, which was first      
 produced in November 1984 by a        
 voluntary committee. The original idea
 for a magazine came from the          
 Kettlethorpe Parish Council, who saw a
 definite need for communication       
 between the surrounding villages of   
 Kettlethorpe, Fenton, Laughterton,    
 Marton, Torksey and Newton. The       
 magazine consists of eight pages, a   
 diary of events, schools page, quiz   
 page, church news, local business     
 adverts and a feature page. At present
 it is produced bi-monthly and printed 
 by the Aveland Youth Training Workshop
 in Grantham. A mobile library calls at
 Fenton fortnightly and local residents
 can be supplied with any type of book 
 they wish. Certain books may be       
 ordered. The service is provided by   
 Lincolnshire County Council.          </content>
