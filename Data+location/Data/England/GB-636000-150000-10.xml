		<title>10The Library and Reading</title>
		<content> The new Deal Library opened on        
 December 6th 1976. To obtain books it 
 has a van come each Monday. The       
 librarians look at the books, choose  
 some and the van leaves on Wednesday. 
 The library owns roughly 59,500 books,
 but a third should be on loan at any  
 time. The most popular books are      
{detective/murder stories, romances}and
 mainly new books. The library obtains 
 new books from bookshops in Kent.     
 Most people use Deal Library a lot. A 
 third of the people like the new      
 computer system and a third dislike   
 it. Some people wished there were     
 still{mobile libraries}and very few   
 grown-ups use a book club. A lot of   
 people seem to enjoy a good read but  
 don't read more than a book a week.   
 Overall I think peoples' reading      
 habits in Deal are very variable.
