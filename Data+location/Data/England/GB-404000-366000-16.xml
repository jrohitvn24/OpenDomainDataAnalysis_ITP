		<title>16Body in the Bog</title>
		<content>Sara Slack Age 9                       
My Dad Edward Slack works at a peat    
farm. When Dad was milling the peat he 
saw a Â£thing', his mate threw it at    
him. He thought that it was a piece    
of wood. Dad looked carefully and      
realized that it was part of a leg and 
foot. It was brown with a toe nail     
still on, bones were sticking out of   
the toes. Dad sent for the police.     
A week later they found the rest of    
the body sticking out of the peat. On  
Saturday I went to work with my Dad and
I saw the body in the bog. It was      
horrible .                             
It is now in the British Museum. They  
think he was 20 yrs when he was        
strangled. His body is about 2,500     
years old.
