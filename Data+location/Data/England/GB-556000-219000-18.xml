		<title>18GREAT CANFIELD PARK</title>
		<content> There are several interesting houses  
 in the area dating back over the      
 centuries.  One of these is Great     
 Canfield Park which was built in 1456 
 by the Earl of Oxford who owned much  
 of the land in these pats.  Originally
 the house was a hunting lodge in a    
 deer park.  In the 17th century the   
 house was acquired by the Maynard     
 family and remained in their hands    
 until it was bought in 1928 by the    
 late General Claud Charlton, High     
 Sherriff of Essex.  The Charlton      
 family still live at the Park and have
 played a very important and active    
 role in the development of Takeley as 
 it is today.
