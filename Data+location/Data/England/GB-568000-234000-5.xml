		<content> Residents feel that village life is   
 peaceful quiet and private. Although  
 living here could be lonely. An effort
 to 'get involved' is essential for    
 those needing contact with others     
 There is a good community feeling also
 a good environment to bring children  
 up in. Due to lack of amenities,      
 housing and limited number of local   
 jobs in the village many young people 
 have to leave the village.            
 A 'focal point' in the village is     
 lacking since the closure of the      
 village shop and post office in l982  
 Most residents feel a village shop is 
 needed both to help older residents   
 and also to create a centre for       
 providing a meeting place.Plans are   
 underway to restore a shop in l985    
 Planning permission was at first      
 refused but a petition has been       
 organized to object to this decision. </content>
