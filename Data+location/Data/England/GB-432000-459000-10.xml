		<title>10Homes and Housing</title>
		<content>   Housing is mainly concentrated in   
 the villages with some buildings along
 the roads. Oldest houses are built    
 with Yorkshire stone and some handmade
 bricks, with roofs of pantiles or     
 stone slabs. New houses are Yorkshire 
 stone with roofs of pantiles, blue    
 slates or concrete tiles. Some stone  
 dwellings have been converted from    
 reduntant farm outbuildings. Many old 
 buildings are historically listed so  
 that features such as catslide roofs  
 and Yorkshire lights will not         
 disappear.                            
  Housing is mainly owner-occupied,    
 except for a few council houses and   
 privately owned tenant houses.        
  The County Structure Plan reduces the
 rate of house building to local needs 
 to protect village character and to   
 preserve farmland. Mandatory grants   
 are available for basic amenities.    </content>
