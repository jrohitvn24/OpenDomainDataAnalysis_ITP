		<content>  Beep-beep. My digital watch sounds   
 the alarm. I get ready for school.    
 Downstairs I listen to the radio      
 whilst having my cereals and examine  
 the free gift from the packet. Before 
 I go to school I watch some television
 and page{'ORICAL'}to see what's on    
 later.                                
   I go off to school and arrive just  
 before the bell. In Maths I use a     
 calculator for some of the sums,      
 because they are hard. At dinner time 
 I go home for my dinner,              
 which is cooked in the{Microwave.}Back
 to school where I get ready for some  
 more boring lessons.                  
     After school I go home and watch  
 more television.Then I'll have my tea.
 Later I'll play on my{computer}or I   
 might get a{Video}or listen to my     
 records. Then I'll go to bed and      
 read for a while.                     </content>
