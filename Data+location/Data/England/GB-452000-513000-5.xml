		<content> Although the area is well provided    
 with small corner shops, specialist   
 items such as sporting equipment or   
 domestic appliances have to be bought 
 in Middlesbrough or Stockton.         
 Recreational facilities are sparse.   
 The nearest swimming baths are 4 miles
 away. There are no sports centres,    
 B.M.X. tracks or cinemas within the   
 immediate vicinity. Although there are
 several green areas, many of these are
 privately owned. Others are rather    
 small and on some the playing of games
 is prohibited. Some of the hilly areas
 on the estate have been planted with  
 trees recently and this restricts our 
 winter pastime of sledging.           
 Considering the high 'rates' which    
 residents in the area pay, we feel    
 that there is inadequate provision    
 for recreation, especially for younger
 children.                             </content>
