 Lanchester,however,has several private
 estates,the earliest built in 1963-65,
 and the latest in 1985.A four bedroom 
 detached house here costs between     
 Â£50,000-Â£60,000. Although most are now
 built of brick, the older houses      
 (oldest-1690)were built of stone mined
 from nearby Maiden Law Quarry,which is
 no longer in existance.Most houses    
 have gas- fired central heating. A    
 typical two bedroomed terrace house in
 Burnhope sells for approx.            
 Â£11,000,where as the same house in    
 Lanchester would fetch between        
 Â£20,000-Â£23,000.
