		<content> In September 1916 a German Zeppelin   
 crashed in Billericay killing the crew
 We visited Mary Needham who was aged  
 eight at the time. Her parents were   
 the Master and Matron of the Workhouse
 On this night Miss Needham was asleep 
 with her sister when her terrified    
 mother woke her. The Zepplin in flames
 seemed certain to crash on their home.
 Mrs.Needham said"If we are to die we  
 shall die together",and got into bed  
 with her daughters.Fortunatley the    
 Zepplin drifted on and finally crashed
 into a field in Green's Farms Lane.   
 Mr.Needham and his son joined the     
 hundreds of people who came from as   
 far away as London to see the         
 wreck.The farmer's mangold crop was   
 ruined and he had to wait for three   
 years for compensation.Billericay was 
 "on the map "at last!.
