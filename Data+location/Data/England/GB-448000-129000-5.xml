		<title>05The M3 Extension.</title>
		<content> The M3 extension from Popham to Bar   
 End was finished Spring 1985. Mott,   
 Hay and Anderson hope to finish the   
 Bar End to Bassett stretch in 1988.   
 They designed the M3 extension because
 of the volume of traffic. The M3 has 3
 sometimes 4 lanes. Popham to Bar End  
 has 3 sometimes 2. The motorway was   
 built by laying a base of pebbles 2m  
 down, then sand or finer material,    
 covered with layers of stone (for     
 drainage), then a surface of asphalt  
 or concrete. The next part,Bar End to 
 Bassett will cost Â£50 million . Mott, 
 Hay and Anderson are the consultant   
 engineers. They had problems with     
 purchasing the land, farmers and other
 people objecting to losing their land 
 and the noise.The old Winchester      
 By-Pass will be left.The Spitfire     
 Bridge was knocked down because it was
 cheaper to replace it with a new one. </content>
