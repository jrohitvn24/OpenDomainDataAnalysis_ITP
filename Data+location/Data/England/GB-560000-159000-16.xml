		<title>16MEDIA.The Vigo Journal.</title>
		<content> A form of the Vigo Journal was first  
 produced some nineteen years ago.At   
 first it was only a sheet of          
 paper.After eight years it was        
 transformed into a small magazine of  
 about forty pages with news of Vigo   
 Village at its best and at its        
 worst.The first editor was Dr. Bill   
 Thomas, who printed the booklet on a  
 spirit duplicator in his garage.Since 
 April 1985 Ian Wakefield has been     
 editor.                               
       There was originally ten        
 publications of the Journal a year,but
 because of a cutback in money there   
 are now only eight produced.The cost  
 of production is much higher than the 
 money the Journal receives from its   
 sales.Therefore,adverts are necessary 
 to make up the difference.
