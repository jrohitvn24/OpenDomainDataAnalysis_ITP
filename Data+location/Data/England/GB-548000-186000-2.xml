		<title>02WARREN FARM, ROMFORD</title>
		<content>    Warren Farm is a 900 acre arable   
 farm in the middle of a built up area.
 It is bordered by Chadwell Heath on   
 the West and Romford on the East.     
 Winter wheat,winter and spring        
 barley,rape and potatoes are grown.   
   Although it is convenient for the   
 farmer and his family to be near many 
 amenities the farm suffers from some  
 vandalism.Machinery gets smashed and  
 fires are lit.                        
   The farm has been owned by the same 
 family for 87 years but the day to day
 running is left to a farm manager and 
 4 staff.The family have had many      
 offers from builders to to buy the    
 farm for housing development,but they 
 have no intention of selling it.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
