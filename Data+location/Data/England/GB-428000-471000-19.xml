		<content> the subject of heated debates in the  
 council chamber are the questions of  
 where to position the jubilee fountain
 and how to improve the public         
 lavatories in the market place.It is  
 said that these have deterred tourists
 and that they give a bad impression to
 visitors.                             
  Next year the city celebrates its    
 1100th birthday,and the local people  
 have been preparing for this historic 
 event.The main sports clubs have      
 organised matches against teams of    
 international standard at Rugby,      
 cricket and soccer.The Cathedral will 
 be the scene of plays and concerts.   
 Fountains Abbey will again be the     
 scene of medieval"revels",similar to  
 those held in 1886 during the         
 millenary celebrations.
