		<content>     {Dairy farming}is an{industry.}   
{Milk}is mainly produced in the{South  
{West}of {England.                     
      The milk that the cows produce   
 must be germ free.To achieve this the 
 cows{udder}must be cleaned before the 
 milk is taken out. The milk must be   
 cleaned to{4 degrees celsius}to stop  
 bacteria from getting in to it.       
      In Clawton the main breed of     
 dairy cattle is the{British Friesian, 
 it is very good because of its high   
 milk yield.The{Jersey}is quite popular
 in Devon , for its high butter fat.   
      Cows are now nearly all milked by
{machine,}the machine is called a      
 milker.A{milking parlour}is where the 
 cows get milked,most parlours have a  
{bulk tank}it is a very large tank     
 which keeps the milk cold until the   
{milk tanker}arrives.
