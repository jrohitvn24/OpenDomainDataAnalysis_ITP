		<content> I was 10 when the war started.There   
 was a lot of war work in this area.   
 They made bombs and the aircraft to   
 drop them.School then was the{3Rs:    
 Reading,wRiting &amp; aRithmetic.We wore a
 uniform with thick black stockings.I  
 used to hate 'em.They made my legs    
 itch.The teachers were strict.No      
 wandering round the room.You got a    
 ruler over your knuckles.Work was     
 written on the blackboard.My parents  
 never went anywhere near the school   
 unless I got into trouble.            
 We used to play Tip Cat.You pinched   
 the end of your mother's broom and    
 sharpened each end.After dropping it  
 on the floor you tipped the end with a
 stick and hit it as far as you could. 
 The greengrocer's cart came round with
 rabbits hanging on the back.You could 
 buy a decent sized one for sixpence.If
 you had turkey at Xmas you'd arrived! </content>
