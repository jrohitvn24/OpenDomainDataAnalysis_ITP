		<title>19An Eighty Year Old Geranium</title>
		<content>   Just one year ago a new venture     
 appeared in{Hatherop,}a market garden.
 Since 1705 the Castle had a two and a 
 half acre garden to supply it with    
 food. As the castle has not been used 
 as a family house for the last thirty 
 years the garden has become overgrown.
  The  new proprietor intends to grow  
 his crops organically, that is without
 the use of fertilizers, pesticides or 
 weedkillers which may be harmful to   
 the soil.Although the garden is       
 producing crops, it is not yet in full
 production. It will take another two  
 years before all the ground is        
 cultivated.                           
  In one of the greenhouses there ia   
 an enormous geranium. It is almost    
 twenty foot high and more than forty  
 foot in width. It is thought to have  
 been planted before 1900.
