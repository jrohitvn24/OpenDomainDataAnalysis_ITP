		<title>01S.Tyne Centred On Dilston</title>
		<content> A rural area mainly of sandstone with 
 poor soil rising to 191 metres.   Just
 under one quarter is coniferous       
 plantations with roedeer red squirrels
 badgers, foxes, rabbits, large        
 anthrills.   The scattered mixed farms
 are old family-owned with large barns 
 for fodder for the long winters.      
 Although built of local sandstone they
 have been re-roofed in slate.         
 Interconnecting lanes are lined wuth  
 dry stone walls and /or remnants of   
 old deciduous woodland.   The ruined  
 castle of Dilston, associated with the
 Jacobite rebellion, and resident ghost
 rises from a cliff near picturesque   
 Devil Water.   Nearby is a Scouts     
 camping ground.   This isolated and   
 sparsely inhabited area gives way in  
 the north to the lower land towards   
 the River Tyne.   Here there are good 
 public transport services easily      </content>
