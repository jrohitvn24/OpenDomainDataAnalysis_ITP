   Television occupies a great deal of 
 our spare time.                       
   Our class survey showed that 60%    
 watch more than 5 hours television    
 each day.More than 50% watch          
 television in the morning prior to    
 coming to school.                     
   After school 80% switch on the      
 television using it as a programme    
 guide.The number watching falls to 40%
 between 4 and 6 o'clock.Between 7 and 
 9 it reaches 60% falling again to 40% 
 between 9 and 11 pm.64% of children   
 have a video set to supplement their  
 television diet.This is used by the   
 children to record progammes shown    
 outside their viewing time and to view
 hired films.On average 3-5 films are  
 hired per week.
