		<title>08SURVEY OF HOMES IN CAPEL</title>
		<content>   We did a survey of the houses in    
 Capel_le_Ferne and the materials used 
 in making them.The most popular type  
 of home is the bungalow. In some roads
 they are mostly semi_detached,whilst  
 in others they are detached. The most 
 recent homes have tended to be houses,
 no doubt to save land. There are no   
 terraced houses and the only flats are
 in large older houses.                
   Nearly all the properties are built 
 of brick,though there are some older  
 homes built from flint and even wood.A
 good number of houses are pebble      
 dashed.The roofs are tiled or of      
 slate.There are hardly any houses in  
 the village over 100 years old. Quite 
 a few homes were built in the 20's and
 30's, but the bulk of house or rather 
 bungalow building came after 1935 when
 the A20 was completed.
