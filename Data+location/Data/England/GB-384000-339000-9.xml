		<content>Trentham Gardens used to be the home of
the Dukes of Sutherland.At the top of  
the hill overlooking his 1000 acre     
estate stands a bronze statue of the   
Duke of Sutherland.Now Trentham Gardens
Ltd,with John Broome as chairman owns  
only 500 acres of the estate the rest  
is owned by the N.C.B;Trentham Gardens 
was the first stately home to be open  
to the public,when people paid half a  
penny entrance in the early 1900's.It  
was a day out in the country for the   
children who worked in the potteries   
around Tunstall and Burslem.The first  
Trentham Hall was either formed out of 
the old Priory building or built on    
their site.In 1634 a new Hall in the   
Elizabethan style was built.In 1834 the
2nd Duke of Sutherland had the hall    
reconstructed in an Italian style from 
designs by Sir Charles Barry R.A. but  
it was demolished in 1911.             </content>
