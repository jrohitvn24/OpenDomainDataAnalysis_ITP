		<content>  In our survey of the older children  
 of Bishop  Pursglove Primary School we
 found out that 94.6% of the families  
 had a car.This is probably because    
 Tideswell is not very near to any big 
 town.Sheffield is about 16 miles away,
 Chesterfield 17 and  Manchester 30    
 miles  away.38% of families have motor
 bikes.98.2% have at least one bicycle.
 Most of the bicycles belonged to      
 children,though a few belonged to     
 adults.There are bus services through 
 Tideswell,to Chesterfield,Sheffield,  
 Buxton and Manchester, but only 12.5% 
 of the children use buses at least    
 once a week.                          
  Some common makes of cars owned by   
 by Tideswell people are               
 Ford        Renault        Vauxhall   
 B.M.W.      Austin Rover   Land Rover 
 Mini        Datsun/Nissan  Skoda      
 Volkswagon  Subaru.                   </content>
