		<content>{Manor Farm}is situated close to the   
 Mexborough Public House in Thorner.   
 ({The land owner was Lord Mexborough)}
 The farm is run by Mr. Walmesley, his 
 wife and two others. It is a large    
 farm of over 400 acres. Wheat is      
 planted on 121 acres, barley on 120   
 acres, oil seed rape on 45 acres,     
 potatoes on 20 acres and grass on 95  
 acres.                                
 There are 120 ewes and 150 beef cows. 
 Farm machinery includes a combine     
 harvester and 6 tractors.             
 Most produce is sold at the local     
 markets at Otley and Pannal, the rest 
 feeding the stock.                    
 --------------------------------------
{Bramley Grange Farm}at the edge of the
 village rears hens, sheep, pigs and   
 cattle. They find that the kennel and 
 cattery on the farm is more lucrative 
 than farming!                         </content>
