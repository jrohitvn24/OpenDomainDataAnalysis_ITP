 only isolated dwellings amongst the   
 fields and woods. Farnborough is the  
 only village and this is very small

 adults and 16 children. The parish as 
 a whole has only 85 inhabitants in    
 total.                                
 The land is used for a variety of     
 crops including wheat,barley,oats and 
 some root crops such as swedes and    
 turnips. The cattle are mainly for    
 Dairy but some are kept for beef.     
 There are many sheep on the Downs as  
 this is traditional in the region.    
 There are several Drove roads in the  
 area. Gallops are another feature of  
 as this is one of the main race horse 
 training areas. Wildlife is abundant. 
 Woodland is both Coniferous Deciduous 
 and mixed.
