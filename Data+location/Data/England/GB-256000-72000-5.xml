		<title>05Along the Old Railway Track.</title>
		<content> It was a lovely hot day and the view  
 was superb.Along the side of the track
 we saw some hut circles (the remains  
 of Bronze Age homes) and the ruins of 
 old signal boxes. When we got to King 
 Tor Halt we saw two disused quarries, 
 Foggintor quarry and Swelltor quarry. 
 The line was originally built to carry
 granite from the quarries to Plymouth.
 The granite from Swelltor quarry was  
 used to build London Bridge. From King
 Tor Halt the track makes a huge loop, 
 several miles long around King Tor    
 because the gradient is so steep but  
 we could see the reurn line only a    
 short distance away.From Princetown to
 Yelverton is six miles, as the crow   
 flies but the track covers eleven.The 
 ladies in the canteen used to travel  
 on the railway and they told us how   
 lovely it was.I hope they wll re-open 
 the Princetown line again.            </content>
