		<title>15ECOLOGY IN GRIMLEY</title>
		<content>    Surrounding the village of Grimley 
 are several large ponds. Some have    
 been formed from  gravel excavations. 
 Water seeking plants grow here and    
 various water fowl can be seen. Swans 
 nest on the ponds between the school  
 and the River Severn. This area, the  
 flood plain of the river, is marshy   
 and left to grow naturally.           
    Crack willows and other species of 
 trees surround the school area. Hedge-
 rows are still in existence and give  
 cover for wildlife and vegetation.    
    Monkwood near Sinton Green is an   
 ancient wood and a habitat for wild   
 life. The trees are mainly deciduous. 
 Many wild flowers grow here and sever-
 al species of butterflies can be seen.
 Pheasants wander about.               
    There are many footpaths in the    
 parish which give access to the river 
 and the surrounding countryside.      </content>
