		<title>12NATURE RESERVE IN BRADWELL</title>
		<content>   Now that the nature reserve at      
{Woodlands Middle School}has been      
 established, there are plans to       
 improve it as more money is raised.   
   Recently, the project was boosted   
 with a national award of Â£500. This   
 money has been used to make a         
 tree-lined lane up to the reserve. Now
 people will be able to approach the   
 reserve unobserved.                   
   A bird hide has recently been       
 erected with money raised by the      
 Parents and Friends Association.      
   Other plans include a second and    
 larger pond to encourage birds to     
 overwinter here.                      
   One of the aims of this project was 
 to restore the name of Woodlands. In  
 years to come we hope this aim will   
 have been achieved.
