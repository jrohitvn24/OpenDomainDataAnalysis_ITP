		<content>Tuesday                                
I get up at about 7.55.I go down       
stairs,have my breakfast and clean my  
teeth,then I have a wash and get       
dressed for school.By the time I've    
done that and brushed my hair it is    
time to catch the school bus.We get to 
school at about 9.00.When we get into  
class we read our books while the      
teacher calls the register. Then we do 
some Maths or English. At 10.30 we     
go swimming at Witney swimming pool    
and we come back at 11.30.When we      
get back we carry on with our work     
until 12.10 then we go out to play     
until 1.15. In the afternoon we do     
topic and at 3.15 we go home. When     
I get home I watch T.V and have my tea 
at about 5.00.Then I go to see my nan  
and I come back at about 8.00.         
Sometimes I read a book and I go to bed
at about 9.00.                         </content>
