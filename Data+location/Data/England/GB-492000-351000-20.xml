		<title>20LANDSCAPE OF LEADENHAM</title>
		<content> Looking in any direction from the     
 village of Leadenham,the first thing  
 noticed is that all of Lincolnshire is
 certainly not flat. People from       
 outside the County always equate      
 Lincolnshire with flat countryside.The
 outlook from this village shows quite 
 a different picture.To the east the   
 land rises up towards the Lincolnshire
 Cliff.The fields which form this part 
 of the landscape show a variety of    
 colours as the seasons alter giving an
 ever changing picture.To the west the 
 land falls away towards the Trent     
 Valley.This gives a varying picture of
 fields broken only by the A17 road.   
 This survey has been compiled by the  
 Leadenham Branch of the Women's       
 Institute,assisted by Terry Cockerill 
 and Andy Anderson and with much help  
 from the residents of the Village.
