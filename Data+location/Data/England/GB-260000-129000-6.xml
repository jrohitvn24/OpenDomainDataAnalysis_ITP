		<content>{   In 1985 many families have at least
{one motor car and some have more than 
{this.} Personal transport is regarded 
 by many as a necessity. Even a few    
 years ago most children walked to     
 school, now only the nearest arrive   
 this way while all the rest travel in 
 private motor cars. {Many people      
{continue to use the hourly bus for    
{shopping expeditions into Barnstaple  
{or to go to South Molton for secondary
{education.                            
   The A.361 passes through the village
 and on a Friday in May we noted that  
 an average of 200 vehicles used the   
 route in both directions during school
 hours. It is estimted that around a   
 million vehicles use this road in both
 directions annually. {Approximately   
{15% of these vehicles are heavy       
{lorries, 80% private cars with around 
{5% bicycles, buses and coaches. }     </content>
