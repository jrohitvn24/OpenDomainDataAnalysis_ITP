		<title>02THE TOWN OF PETERSFIELD</title>
		<content>{Petersfield}was created as a new town 
 about 800 years ago. It took its name 
 from the church of St. Peter's-in-the-
 fields which was a chapel of the      
 church at Buriton. There are still    
 some old buildings, especially around 
 the Square, as well as some modern    
 ones, such as the Library and some new
 factories in a small industrial estate
 on the edge of the town. Here are the 
 factories of Whitmans Laboratories,   
 Estee Lauder Cosmetics, and the older 
 established firm of Henry Willis,     
 Organ Builders. I.T.S. Rubber have an 
 older factory near the town centre.   
 A feature of the Square is the lead   
 statue of William III. He has no      
 connection with Petersfield, but Sir  
 William Jolliffe MP left money for it 
 to be erected. It was made in l753 by 
 John Cheere, sculptor, of London.
