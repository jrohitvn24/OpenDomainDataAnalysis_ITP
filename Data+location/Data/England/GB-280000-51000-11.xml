 years.At one time the pub was{two     
{cottages,where farm workers lived.}The
 cottages were three or four hundred   
 years old.The owner of the pub came   
 about ten years ago when one end of   
 the pub was a{garage}with petrol pumps
 outside.Being near holiday resorts the
 pub has a lot of tourists.{At one time
 there used to be{four rooms to let}but
 these were{very old fashioned}with few
 facilities.                           
 The{walls}of the Sportsmans Arms are  
{22 inches thick}and the{pub is 678    
{feet above sea level.}It stands where 
 the old Dartmouth-Totnes and          
 Dittisham-Blackawton roads crossed.

 and during World War 2 separate{field 
{hospitals}for{white and black U.S.
