   We found most of the footpaths      
marked on our map, but one or two had  
vanished and one was very overgrown and
not easily walkable.                   
   A few hedges remain.  Most of these 
are of hawthorn and planted to protect 
the crops.  One stretch of ancient     
hedge contains beech, privet, sycamore 
and hawthorn in a 30 metre stretch.    
   One farmer we talked to is conscious
of the need to conserve plants and wild
flowers and will not allow council     
spraying on his land.  We saw daisies, 
buttercups, dandelions and foxgloves.  
Also he has planted 400 young trees, as
the trees have been destroyed in the   
past to make more land for crops.  He  
also keeps peacocks, ducks and         
free-range hens.
