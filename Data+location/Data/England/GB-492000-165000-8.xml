		<content> There is flourishing Gardening Society
 which meets in the Women's Institute  
 hut inthe recreation ground.There are 
 nearly 100 members,aged from 20 to    
 80.the Society was started in 1940 and
 meets once a month.                   
 Many members grow flowers and are     
 interested in flower arranging.They   
 also grow vegetables,especially       
 brassicas,which grow well in the light
 sandy soil.They often have lectures on
 gardening and hold quizzes and have a 
 special celebration at Christmas.     
 Some of the members had allotments so 
 that 26 new houses could be built.The 
 society were very glad that the       
 attempt was unsuccessful.             
 There are plenty of garden centres in 
 the area where they can buy the       
 supplies they need.
