		<title>15HEALEY MILLS GOOD YARD</title>
		<content>  {Healey Mills Goods Yard}is the      
 biggest goods yard in the area.  It   
 has two{snow ploughs.} Their colours  
 are yellow and black. There are no    
{steam locomotives.}The{goods}come into
 the yard and{shunters}shunt them into 
 the right places. You cannot go into  
 the yard, but there is a path along   
 the edge for the{public}to walk on.   
   At one end of the yard there is some
{dismantling}and a pile of{rails}which 
 are{disused.}                         
   The men who work in the yard wear   
 blue suits.                           
   In the yard there are six sets of   
{lights}which are like{floodlights}at a
 football ground, but much bigger.     
 There is a{building}which the men work
 from and a car park for them to park  
 their cars.
