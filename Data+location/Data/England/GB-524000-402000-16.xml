		<title>16Today's Farming In Waltham.</title>
		<content>   The farming land in our block is    
 mainly arable.No longer is there the  
 four crop rotation system as nowadays 
 farmers plant four or five cereal     
 crops, wheat and barley following each
 other.                                
   They can use fertilisers to enrich  
 the land and provide the nutrients the
 crops need.Most farmers use new,      
 improved corn varieties which are sown
 in September and harvested in July  or
 August.They produce more tonnes per   
 acre because of the longer growing    
 time. Linseed rape and sugar beet are 
 used as profitable break-crops.       
   Since the second world war farmers  
 have used bigger machines, in         
 particular tractors.These pull highly 
 developed implements to do the        
 work previously done manually.As a    
 result fewer men are needed to work   
 increasingly larger areas.            </content>
