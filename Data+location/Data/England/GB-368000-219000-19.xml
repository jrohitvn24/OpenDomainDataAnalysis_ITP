{Longhope, MayHill and Huntley,}so     
 people have to make their own. Local  
 clubs and societies exist to provide  
 for toddlers, Playgroup, Youth Club,  
 sports, amateur dramatics and dancing.
 The{Cubs, Brownies and Scouts}are     
 based at the churches but most other  
 societies meet in the village hall. A 
 very important amenity in{Longhope
