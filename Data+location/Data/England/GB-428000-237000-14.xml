 activities for young people.Brailes   
 Silver Band gives them an opportunity 
 to learn a brass instrument.The band  
 rehearses twice a week in the Free    
 School and it often plays at local    
 events.There is also a junior section 
 of the Badminton Club,which meets in  
 the Village Hall.                     
   Three of the groups meet at the Old 
 School;the Cubs on Monday,the Guides  
 on Wedenesday and the Brownies on     
 Thursday.They play games,work for     
 badges and go camping.                
   Some people belong to the church    
 choir which practises  every Friday.  
 After the service on Sunday morning   
 young children attend the Seekers     
 Club. On Wednesday older boys and     
 girls go to the Young Peoples         
 Fellowship.
