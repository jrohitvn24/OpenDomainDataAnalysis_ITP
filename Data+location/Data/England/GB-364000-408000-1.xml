		<content>   There are two main types of land    
 cover in this area.                   
 1. Agricultural   2. Residential      
                                       
   The agricultural land lies on either
 side of the railway which runs from   
 west to east across the block. Low    
 lying farmland in the south of the    
 block gradually gives way to hilly    
 moorland in the north.                
                                       
   The residential areas lie to the    
 northwest and southeast corners of the
 block. The residential area to the    
 southeast is developing in particular 
 around Lostock junction. The          
 residential area to the northwest is  
 older and more established. A sharp   
 contrast exists between the post      
 industrial population from the        
 established housing and the more      
 modern and affluent commuter areas.   </content>
