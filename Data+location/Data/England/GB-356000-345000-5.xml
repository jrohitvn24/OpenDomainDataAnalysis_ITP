 She has to design these by drawing    
 everything before she starts.One item 
 was a miniature watering can, another 
 a rabbit bookmark, and a bracelet     
 decorated with ebony balls.She        
 specializes in repair work and often  
 people with trophies to mend want them
 back the next day! New articles have  
 to be sent away to be stamped at the  
 assay office.There, a little of the   
 silver is scratched off to make sure  
 it is{sterling silver __ 975 parts in 
{1000 of pure silver, the other 25     
{parts are an alloy,usually copper.}The
 stamp which is called a hallmark,shows
 the initials of the silversmith, a    
 lion to say it is sterling silver, the
 leopard's head to show it has been to 
 London and a letter to show the year  
 it was made. Other assay offices are  
 in Birmingham,Sheffield and Edinburgh.</content>
