		<title>19New Houses</title>
		<content>                                       
 There is a lot of disagreement about  
 the building of seven new houses in   
 the village.  People like the insides 
 of these houses but the outsides dont 
 match the older houses here.          
 We are sorry that the new houses      
 haven't been better designed to save  
 energy,  e.g. they should have double 
 glazing.                              
 David,who lives in one of the new     
 houses, likes his house and likes the 
 men who are building the new houses.  
 He also says that they cost a lot     
 of money to build and buy.            
 Sarah wants to see more families live 
 in the area but Sara doesn't want the 
 quiet of the village to be spoiled.
