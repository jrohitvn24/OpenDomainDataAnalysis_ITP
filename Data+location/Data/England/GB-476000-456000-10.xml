		<content>      On Moat Farm there are five full 
 time workers and one student who comes
 to help at lambing time and harvest.  
 In a year they use about 450 tonnes of
 fertiliser.  There are 810 ewes and   
 the total number of tups, ewes,       
 gimmers and lambs is 2,700.  In       
 lambing time about 1,500 lambs are    
 born.  There are usually about 20 pet 
 lambs without mothers.  During lambing
 they use 10 tonnes of sheep cake when 
 the sheep are indoors and another 8   
 tonnes when they are turned out.      
      There are 130 cattle and about   
 430 through the system in a year.     
 They feed about 20 to 25 tonnes of    
 silage a year.  The farm has 11       
 tractors 4 of which are four wheel    
 drive.  They have two combines each   
 with an 18 foot cut.
