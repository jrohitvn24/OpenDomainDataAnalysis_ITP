		<title>04THE CHURCH (cont)</title>
		<content> The screen was in very bad condition  
 and was almost entirely rebuilt by    
 Mr Bushell in 1881. The three old     
 bells were rehung in 1937 quite a long
 time after the church was rebuilt and 
 two new ones were added. The oldest   
 bell is the tenor which was cast in   
 1677. The present bell ringers are    
 doing very well and have won lots of  
 trophies and cups. They have about 25 
 trophies.
