		<content> In our school there are two houses,   
 Constable and Munnings, because they  
 were both local painters. We have 140 
 children and we all wear school       
 uniform. We attend this school from   
 the age of five to eleven, then we go 
 to a secondary school. We have parties
 and a Carol Service at Christmas. In  
 the Spring we do plays and concerts.  
 During the Summer we have Speech Day  
 and Open Day. In the Autumn and Winter
 the boys play football and the girls  
 play netball. In the Summer we all do 
 athletics and play rounders. We have a
 Head Boy, a Head Girl, House Captains 
 and Prefects. Every Friday afternoon  
 parents come to Assembly.             
 This year the top two classes have all
 helped with the Domesday Project under
 the guidance of M.A.&amp; R.H.Knott and   
 Jeremy Parkin who took the            
 photographs.                          </content>
