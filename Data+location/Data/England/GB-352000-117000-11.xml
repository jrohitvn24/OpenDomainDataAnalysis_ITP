		<title>11YEOVIL COUNCIL_BRYMPTON</title>
		<content>  There are 9 members of the Brympton  
 Parish Council and they meet each     
 month to debate local issues including
 planning                              
 applications,playgrounds,street       
 lighting,road and pathway conditions  
 and amenities.                        
  The average age of councillors is 40 
 and most became members because they  
 wanted to help the community.These    
 numbers were recently increased to    
 reflect the changes in population but 
 some adjustment is still needed as one
 or two members represent a very rural 
 area,with few people but still have a 
 full vote.Some councillors felt that  
 they could do more if they were not so
 tightly controlled by the district and
 county councils who did not fully     
 understand local needs ,but much could
 be achieved given councillors with    
 enough energy.                        </content>
