		<title>06History: Cobham Hall Estate</title>
		<content> By 1660, the village of Shorne was    
 taking its present shape, with Shorne 
 Ridgeway and other outlying areas.    
 During the 17th and 18th Centuries    
 farming was done on an increasingly   
 large scale in the area.              
 In the 1780s, Lord Darnley expanded   
 Cobham Hall estate, including farms   
 and woodland. By the 1830s, the       
 Darnleys were the big landowners of   
 the area. In the second half of the   
 19th Century Lord Darnley let off     
 farms, coppiced otherwise rough       
 woodland and landscaped the parks     
 around Cobham Hall. A restoration of  
 these parks is shortly to be          
 undertaken. In the 20th Century death 
 duties and money worries led to the   
 selling off of Darnley properties. A  
 big sale of land in 1925 and another  
 after WW2 ended the Darnley influence.
 The remaining woodland is up for sale.</content>
