		<title>20The Formby By-pass &amp; Cycling</title>
		<content> The Formby By-pass (A565) carries     
 many vehicles, including a frequent   
 and well-used bus service from        
 Southport to Freshfield. Its cycle    
 track is little used because of broken
 glass. However bikes are popular,     
 especially with children, for leisure 
 because of the flat landscape.

 The co-ordinating school for this     
 block of the Domesday Survey was      
 Shoreside County Primary School,      
 Ainsdale. We were assisted by St.     
 Peter's C.of E. School, Formby, who   
 contributed the information on St.    
 Peter's Church, Woodvale Airfield and 
 farming and the second page on the    
 Freshfield shops.
