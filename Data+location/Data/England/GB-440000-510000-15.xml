		<title>15River Tees at Yarm</title>
		<content>{The Northumbrian Water Authority} have
 three targets for the river at Yarm.  
{ Target 0ne}is to eliminate the smell,
 improve the appearance of the river   
 and to increase the fish population.  
{ Target two}is to make the river clean
 enough for the re establishment of the
 salmon which have to pass up the      
 estuary and through Yarm to the upper 
 non-tidal reaches.                    
{ Target three}is to return the        
 river to the quality it enjoyed in{   
{1920} before the expansion of the     
 chemical industry. To reach this      
 target would require a masive         
 reduction in the pollution load       
 discharged into the estuary down      
 stream of Yarm.                       
{Costs }of these targets are estimated 
 to be: Target 1    30 million pounds  
        Target 2    80 million pounds  
        Target 3   230 million pounds. </content>
