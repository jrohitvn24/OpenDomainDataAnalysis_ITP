		<title>16WILD LIFE IN ALL STRETTON</title>
		<content>   You will find plenty of wild life   
 in and around All Stretton. There     
 are a lot of house martins there as   
 well. There are lots of squirrels     
 and rabbits and rats and mice and     
 hedgehogs. If you are lucky you might 
 see a badger or a fox. Mink have been 
 seen near the streams.                
   If you go to All Stretton you       
 always see sheep on the hills. Some   
 times you find sheep at school. They  
 are often seen wandering on the roads,
 even on the by-pass.                  
   You will also find ponies with their
 foals on the Long Mynd but there are  
 not as many now as there used to be.  
   There are grass snakes on the hills 
 and some people say there are adders  
 as well. We haven't seen any but we   
 have seen frogs, toads and newts.     
   In the streams there are brown trout
 and lots of bullheads that we catch.  </content>
