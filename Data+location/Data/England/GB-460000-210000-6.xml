		<title>06A day in Oakley School</title>
		<content>On a usual school day l come by car to 
school.I play until the whistle goes.  
Then our teacher calls the register.We 
usually do Maths or English. After play
we swop over our Maths and English. At 
12.00 We have our school dinners.Most  
of our  class have sandwiches, six     
people have school dinners.We have a   
play after  dinner till 1.00pm.        
Sometimes we play skipping or schools  
or play ball as we are  allowed to     
bring a tennis ball. We make up games  
of our own things like adventure       
stories.Usually the boys play          
football.Then we go in to  school.     
Sometimes we hear a story or  do       
art.After that we have another play    
at 2.00pm.Then we either do unexpected 
work, drama,music, games or swimming   
in our school swimming pool.
