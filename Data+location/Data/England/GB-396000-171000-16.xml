		<title>16Jehovah's Witnesses in Calne</title>
		<content> My name is Lynsey Mogan.I live in     
 Calne.I am a Jehovah's Witness.We     
 believe the whole of the Holy Bible,  
 and try to get to know what the Bible 
 says,so that we can practice things   
 that God says.                        
   We go to meetings at the Calne      
 Scouts Hall for two hours on a Sunday,
 to hear a talk on the Bible.Also we   
 study an article from the "Watchtower"
 magazine, which explains the          
 Scriptures.                           
   On Thursday nights we have a meeting
 that helps us to know how to tell     
 others about Jehovah. That is called  
 the Kingdom Ministry School.          
   Every six or seven months we give a 
 five minute talk on a subject like    
 "What is God's name?".Also Brothers   
 read from the Bible and explain it to 
 us.                                   
                                       </content>
