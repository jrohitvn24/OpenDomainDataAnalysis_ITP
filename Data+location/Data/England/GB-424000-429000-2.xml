		<title>02MEMORIES OF COTTINGLEY</title>
		<content>{Mrs.Watkins has lived at Cottingley   
 for thirty years,twenty years in a    
 prefab.In 1947 Cottingley Hall Farm   
 was purchased by the Council who put  
 up 630 prefabs,imported from Norway,  
 each having a lounge,2 bedrooms,      
 kitchen and toilet.After the war oil  
 lamps were used and cookers and frid- 
 ges were gas powered.The residents    
 took pride in their lovely big gardens
 receiving letters from the Council if 
 they were neglected.Permission from   
 the Housing Department was required to
 own a dog.In the middle of the estate 
 was a chapel and a neat little row of 
 shops.                                
{Mrs.Watkins commented on the lack of  
 vandalism during these years,and what 
 a happy close knit community it was.  
 She sometimes whishes she was living  
 in her little prefab today,when Cott- 
 ingley estate was well looked after.  </content>
