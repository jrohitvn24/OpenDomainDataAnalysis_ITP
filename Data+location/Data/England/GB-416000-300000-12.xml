		<content>In 1086 the village was a small farming
community with 9 villeins, 3 bordars   
and 2 mills recorded in Domesday. By   
the 1801 census the population was     
still small (395), increasing to 508   
in 1851.  The numbers declined in the  
next decade to 441, further declining  
to the lowest recorded figure of 365 in
1921.  This fits into a general trend  
of rural depopulation in the 19th      
century, with increased mechanisation  
of farming, and in this case, the      
decline of the Peel family fortunes    
with consequent cut backs on the       
estate.  The population trend has been 
moving upwards since 1945 with the     
building of new housing estates        
(council and private) for Birmingham   
commuters.  The population now         
stands at 711 (1982) and will increase 
in the future with more private        
housing planned in the village.        </content>
