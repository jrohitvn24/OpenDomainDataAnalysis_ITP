		<title>19MITCHELDEAN MARKET</title>
		<content>     The tiny Mitcheldean Town Hall    
 built in 1710, and at present used for
 exhibitions and Parish Council        
 meetings, was originally a market     
 hall. Mitcheldean was well placed for 
 exchange of goods between the Forest  
 mining communities to the west, and   
 the farming country to the east and   
 north. In common with other small     
 market towns, improved roads and      
 transport led to decline in favour of 
 the larger more distant markets. The  
 corn market never really recovered    
 from the riots of 1795, when starving 
 miners attacked loads of corn on their
 way to Gloucester docks for           
 transporting overseas to feed troops. 
 Later, according to local people, the 
 meat market suffered from a belief    
 that the flies on the meat had        
 previously been feeding on rotting    
 corpses hanging from local gallows!   </content>
