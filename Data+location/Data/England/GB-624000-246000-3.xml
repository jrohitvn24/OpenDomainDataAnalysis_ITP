 Seckford Hall was  built in  1530  by 
Thomas Seckford.  The Tudor mansion is 
now a Three Star Hotel.  Mr.Bunn  has  
been Managing Director  for 20 years.  
He has made a few changes to the       
building, the most important being an  
extension to the restaurant. The large 
gardens have been made more manageable.
 The hotel has about 8000 guests a year
from as far away as Japan.Famous people
such as the Prime Minister,Margaret    
Thatcher have stayed there.            
 There are 24 guest rooms,4 lounges, a 
ballroom and dining room.              
72 staff work there, of which 6 live   
on the premises.Food for the restaurant
comes partly from local suppliers.Fresh
lobsters are kept in a tank - the cook 
picks one out ! Vegetarians are catered
for.  Seckford Hall contains alot of   
antiques.                              </content>
