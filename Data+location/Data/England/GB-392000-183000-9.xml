		<content>    {Mr. Jones}told us the amount of   
 traffic has increased a great deal,   
 especially since the{M4 motorway}was  
 built. This has also made the village 
 attractive to commuters, who now make 
 up the bulk of the village's          
 population. For example, it is        
 possible to drive to the centre of    
 Bristol in half-an-hour. Many of the  
 new expensive houses in the village   
 are owned by commuters.               
     The{village school}childen used   
 to walk or cycle to Rodbourne school, 
 now closed down. These days children  
 go by car or bus to{school in Seagry  
{or Malmesbury.                        
     The number of people working on   
 the farms nearby has dropped          
 dramatically.However, some aspects of 
 the village life continue. There is a 
 thriving toddler group, and dances are
 still held in the parish hall.        </content>
