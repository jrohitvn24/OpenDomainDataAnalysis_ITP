		<title>19A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> In the morning I got up out of bed and
 went downstairs and had my breakfast.I
 had Weetabix. I made my sandwiches and
 got changed and at 8 o'clock I went to
 school.                               
                                       
 The school I go to is called Rushbury.
 When all the children are here and it 
 is 9 o'clock we go for Assembly.      
                                       
 After Assembly today we wrote some    
 stories then our teacher took us out  
 to look at the countryside with a map.
 Then the first and second years went  
 to watch the Domesday programme on    
 television.                           
                                       
 Then we had our dinner and played and 
 at 1 o'clock we came in and painted   
 a picture and had a story and went    
 home.                                 
                                       </content>
