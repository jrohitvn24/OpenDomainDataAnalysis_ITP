		<content> Rural areas were the birthplace of    
{Womens Institutes}which provided a    
 cetral focus for village life         
 alongside the pub and the church.     
                                       
 The Women's Institute in particular   
 grew in rural areas and although the  
 square surveyed only has one, that at 
 Milton Bryan, most of the srrounding  
 villages have an active W.I.          
                                       
 The W.I. movement also spread to the  
 towns and its interests and objectives
 moved away in the 80s from the        
 traditinal area of the home and family
 to taking a more active role in       
 matters of current interest.          
                                       
 Another body, the{Townswomen's Guilds}
 offered women a wide range of         
 interesting activities, lectures and  
 events, generally more urban based.   </content>
