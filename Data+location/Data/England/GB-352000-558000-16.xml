		<title>16Health; the patients.</title>
		<content> At the Brampton Memorial Hospital     
 there is accomodation for one long    
 term elderly patient. Ten beds are    
 used for patients sent in by local    
 practitioners. One bed is always kept 
 available for a patient in need of a  
 holiday or whose family need temporary
 relief from caring for the invalid.   
 Day care for three patients, to       
 provide a change and relieve the      
 family is available on five days of   
 the week.                             
 The hospital is pleasantly situated on
 the outskirts of the town on Tarn     
 Road. It stands in its own grounds and
 a hady-man/gardener works there for   
 two days a week. The League of Friends
 are at present raising money to help  
 towards a planned extension which will
 eventually provide an extra 9 beds,   
 more physiotherapy facilities and a   
 chiropody section.                    </content>
