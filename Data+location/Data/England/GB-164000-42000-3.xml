		<title>03Family Life in Illogan</title>
		<content> We found that families make visits,and
 here are some examples:               
 When we went to the {Isles of Scilly }
 we took our car to the car park in    
{Penzance}and went on the Scillonian.  
 In our Summer holiday our family went 
 to {Gosport}to our Auntie Pat's place 
 because it was her daughter's wedding 
 and my sister was a bridesmaid.       
 It was Christmas when my family went  
 up to {London}in a car.It took over   
 six hours. We went to see Big Ben and 
 the sights of{London. }               
 The Royal Cornwall show is held for 3 
 days early in June.Once I went there  
 with my Auntie and Uncle.My Uncle has 
 2 dogs Radiar a German Shepherd dog   
 and Glen a Border Collie and he took  
 them to a dog show.Glen won a prize.  
 Then I went to look around the stalls.
 They give you stickers,hats and       
 balloons.There are fair rides too.    </content>
