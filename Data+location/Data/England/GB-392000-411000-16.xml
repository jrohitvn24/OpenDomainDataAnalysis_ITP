		<content>   Milnrow is situated off the busy    
 Lancashire-Yorkshire{motorway,}the    
 M62,which was opened by the Queen on  
 October 14th 1971. The route taken by 
 the motorway was chosen carefully so  
 that hopefully, it could be kept open 
 even in the worst weather conditions. 
 Parts are exposed and it suffers from 
 snow drifts and high winds. The route 
 includes{Rakewood Viaduct}which is 14O
 ft. high and has six spans of between 
 12O and 15O ft.. There is a junction  
 onto the motorway at Milnrow with a   
 motorway compound in the loop of the  
 slip road. A by-pass around the       
 village was built at the same time as 
 the motorway.                         
   Milnrow and Newhey have{rail}links  
 via Rochdale or Oldham with Manchester
 The stations are unmanned.
