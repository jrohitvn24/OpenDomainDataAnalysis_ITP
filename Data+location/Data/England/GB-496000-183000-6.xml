		<content> Of the 100 people we surveyed we found
 the greatest number to be {Commuters.}
 We fond even some of the local shops  
 were staffed by people outwith our    
 area. The people travelling into      
 London on the whole preferred to use  
 the train as parking in the city is a 
 problem. Others travelled by car. Most
 people worked within a 40 km radius of
 their home. We met 3 people who       
 travelled over 60 km  to work each    
 day. They liked the area and didn't   
 wish to disrupt their children's      
 education so chose not to move.       
   Some of the{locals}in the village   
 see the people on these new estates as
 rather withdrawn from village life.   
 Some said that the village of{Farnham 
{Common}was close resembling a         
{dormitory}town for London,Windsor and 
 Slough.
