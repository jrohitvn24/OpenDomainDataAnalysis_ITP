      In Axminster every thursday,all  
 around the church and in Trinity      
 square there is a market held.        
     The market is a friendly place    
 with lots of colour and noise,you can 
 buy anything from fresh fish to fruit 
 and vegetables.                       
     As you walk into the market from  
 Lyme street,you first come across a   
 cloth stall,where good quality cloth  
 can be bought cheeply.Opposite to this
 is a jumper and "T"shirt stall,with a 
 curtain stall beside it.              
     The Silver street part of the     
 market has a variety of fruit and     
 vegetable stalls as well as some hard 
 ware stalls.                          
     People come from miles around just
 to visit the market.
