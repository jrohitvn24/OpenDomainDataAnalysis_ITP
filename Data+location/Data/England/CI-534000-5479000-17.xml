		<title>17A DAY IN OLIVER'S LIFE</title>
		<content> In the morning I get up at 6:00 and   
 go for a jog.Then I have my breakfast 
 of cornflakes,toast with jam and a cup
 of coffee. Then it is time for school 
 my mum takes me in our Mazda car. The 
 first lesson is maths then we have    
 English. I like swimming and playing  
 on the adventure playground.After     
 playtime we might have reading then at
 12:oo we have lunch in the hall but if
 it is sunny we go on the field .In the
 afternoon we do drawing or stories    
 then we have games or swimming        
 and soon it is time to go home.I watch
 telly and play games like football,   
 kick the can, rounders or go on our   
 wooden climbing frame. My favourite   
 programmes are Knight Rider and no.73 
 and usally go to bed at 8:00.
