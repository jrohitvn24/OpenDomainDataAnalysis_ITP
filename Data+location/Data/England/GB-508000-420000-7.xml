		<title>07GOXHILL PRIORY RESTORED.</title>
		<content> Goxhill Priory is a 13th century      
 Fortified Manor House. In 1976 it was 
 purchased together with the adjacent  
 18th century Hall by architects Mr &amp;  
 Mrs Graham. They chanced to see the   
 property when they missed a ferry to  
 Hull at New Holland and looked around 
 the area. They received grants towards
 the restoration of both Hall and      
 Priory. A group of volunteers helped  
 to excavate  and restore the Priory's 
 barrel vaulted undercroft. The Great  
 Hall, at first floor level, is now in 
 good repair though access to it is not
 easy as the wooden exterior staircase 
 has been missing for some time and a  
 spiral staircase is the only means of 
 entry. It was a condition of the grant
 aid towards its restoration that the  
 Priory should be open to the public on
 request. There are between two and    
 three hundred visitors each year.     </content>
