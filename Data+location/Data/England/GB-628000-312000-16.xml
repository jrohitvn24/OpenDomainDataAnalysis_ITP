		<title>16A Norfolk Reed Thatcher</title>
		<content>{Mr Cossey}has been a reed thatcher for
 nearly 40yrs.He learned his trade     
 working with another thatcher but     
 never served an apprenticeship.He has 
 seen the number of thatchers in his   
 part of Salhouse dwindle from 30+     
 before the war to himself.            
 The reeds come from within a radius of
 20 miles including{Ludham,Horning}    
 and{Catfield.}They are bought ready   
 prepared in bundles and stored under a
 thatched roof in Mr Cossey's garden.  
 Although he has not been abroad to    
 work, Mr Cossey has thatched roofs as 
 far away as Cornwall.About 20yrs ago  
 he did some work for Maxwell Joseph,a 
 multi-millionaire hotelier.           
 The strangest building Mr Cossey has  
 thatched is a 200-300ft water tower on
 the Barnet by-pass!When finishing a   
 roof,Mr Cossey chooses a pattern to   
 suit its character.                   </content>
