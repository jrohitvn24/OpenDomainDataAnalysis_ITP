		<title>11CUSWORTH HALL</title>
		<content> Cusworth Hall is a museum open to the 
 public.It has rooms which display     
 Victorian costume, furniture, kitchen 
 and washing equipment. Other rooms    
 hold items which tell the story of    
 mining and other local industries. The
 Museum holds open days when children  
 can take part in different activities.
 The grounds  are a Public Park where  
 people can have picnics, play games,  
 stroll around or even fish in the     
 lakes. Also in the grounds is a       
 Cricket Field used by local teams.    
 It became a Museum in 1961.           
  In 1669 the Wrightsons bought the    
 house and land to make money. William 
 Wrightson bought village houses as    
 well. In the 1740's William Wrightson 
 decided to build the hall, as it is   
 now. There is a gate house at the     
 entrance which used to be two little  
 cottages.                             </content>
