		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF AREA</title>
		<content> The area is almost totally open       
 country with villages to be found on  
 the very edge, but with their centres 
 into adjoining areas. The only        
 settlement that can be said to be     
 truely within this area is Curdridge, 
 but this is a relatively dispersed    
 settlement with no village centre as  
 such.                                 
 Apart from Curdridge, the rest of the 
 area is virtually all agricultural,   
 though with an interesting pattern to 
 its distribution, dividing into 3     
 types:                                
 1. In the S.W. is an area of Market   
 Gardening                             
 2. The central area is mixed arable   
 and livestock farming                 
 3. The western portion comprises small
 holdings and dairy farming.           
                                       
                                       </content>
