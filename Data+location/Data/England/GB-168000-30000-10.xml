		<title>10Farming:Making Cornish Cream</title>
		<content>      My mum gets up at 7o'clock in the
 morning and gets the cows in from the 
 field.  She has 1 Jersey, 1 Friesian  
 and 8 Geurnseys.  She milks by        
 machine, although she used to milk by 
 hand.                                 
      When she has finished milking all
 ten cows she strains the milk into a  
 churn to get any tiny bits of dirt out
 and then takes the churns to the      
 separating house, where she separates 
 the cream from the milk.  The creamy  
 milk goes into bowls to be scalded and
 the skim milk is fed to the pigs.     
      Once the cream has cooked and has
 a nice crust on it, she puts it into  
 cartons ready for taking to the shop  
 next day.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
