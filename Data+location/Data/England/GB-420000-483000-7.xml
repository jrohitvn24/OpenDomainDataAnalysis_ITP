		<content> Sunday School is organised by the     
 Rector's wife. It meets twice every   
 three weeks at the rectory. Each year 
 the children have an outing to the    
 river Ure at Burton House in Masham.  
                                       
 The children of the Sunday School     
 sometimes join with the children of   
 the School in presenting a religious  
 production in the Church, especially  
 at Christmas.                         
                                       
 Harvest Festival has a special meaning
 among the farming community and       
 because of this the Harvest Festival  
 service has a very high attendance.   
 Latecomers often find nowhere to sit. 
                                       
 The schoolchildren have a special     
 'Leavers Service'at the end of the    
 summer term just before the           
 eleven-year-olds go to Bedale School. </content>
