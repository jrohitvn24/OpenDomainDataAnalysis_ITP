		<title>05Cheadle Homes Survey</title>
		<content>We surveyed 194 homes all of which were
situated in Cheadle.Their ages varied  
from under 10 yrs(48),10-20yrs(52)20-50
yrs(53)&amp; over 50yrs(27).Most of the    
householders worked in the Cheadle area
but many were retired or unemployed.   
109 homes had the use of a car but     
people would have made better use of   
Public Transport had it been cheaper   
and more available.Residents enjoyed   
living in Cheadle because of its       
proximity to lovely countryside &amp; the  
friendliness of its people. Most people
had spent their entire lives in Cheadle
&amp; had never had any desire to move.The 
'newcomers' tended to be more critical 
of the lack of facilities for the      
young,the poor job prospects, the      
traffic congestion &amp; the litter in the 
town centre.Most people thought that   
the High Street could be improved.
