		<content> Vine Farm is a large farmhouse built  
 in l695 by W.T.S. rebuilt in l8O5 by  
 George Edell.Originally made of       
 handmade bricks but has since been    
 pebbledashed.Vine Farm has l45 acres, 
 8O acres is rented and the rest is    
 owned by Mr Everatt senior who has    
 lived here from l932. Now the land is 
 farmed by Richard Everatt and his son 
 David. Last year sugar beet, barley,  
 wheat and onions grew in the fields.  
 During July Vine Farm is locally known
 for its crop of strawberries. Harvest 
 time is the busiest time of the year. 
 Everyone has their own job e.g.       
 combining, leading the corn and taking
 drinkins. Leading the corn is the     
 transporting of wheat back to the     
 farm and drinkins are the snack which 
 the men get at teatime. In the winter 
 months Vine Farm keeps cattle.
