 In our area there are lots of         
 churches. These include Baptist,      
 Methodist,Church of England,Greek     
 Orthodox,Evangelical, and Roman       
 Catholic.Milton Methodist was rebuilt 
 in 1952 because it was bombed in the  
 Second World War.About 230 people go  
 to special services and 130 go to a   
 morning Sunday service and 50 go to   
 the evening service.If you go to a    
 Methodist church it means you are a   
 follower of John Wesley.At the Baptist
 you have to be baptised.At a Church   
 of England like St.Martins they have  
 Bishops.Nearly all the churches in our
 block have Sunday schools.Some        
 churches which include St. Martins and
 Kewstoke have bells but some do       
 not.Vicars in their spare time visit  
 people in hospitals and try to help   
 them.                                 </content>
