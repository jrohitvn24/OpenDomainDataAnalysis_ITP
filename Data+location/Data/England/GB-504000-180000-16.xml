		<title>16LITTLE BRITAIN</title>
		<content> Little Britain Lake is very important 
 as a centre for educational and       
 leisure interests.Schools in the area 
 visit the lake when they use the      
 Little Britain Nature Trail.Originally
 a shallow gravel pit,the lake and its 
 surrounding area has been turned into 
 a mini nature reserve.Many different  
 species of water fowl can been seen   
 there as well as various different    
 species of fish - the lake is a young 
 anglers paradise.Insects,wild flowers 
 and trees are plentiful and can also  
 be  studied.The water here and at the 
 ford is shallow enough for paddling   
 and safe swimming,the ideal spot for a
 week-end family picnic.Local horse    
 riders frequently use the bridle      
 path.It is a good spot for the amateur
 photographer.
