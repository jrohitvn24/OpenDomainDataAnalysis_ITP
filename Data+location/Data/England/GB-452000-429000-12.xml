		<content> St.Mary's church is positioned in     
 St.Mary's Approach just opposite the  
 Old School.People used to go to       
 Brayton Church to worship before St.  
 Mary's was built .In 1872 the Old     
 School was built and on Sundays people
 could worship there.The first stone of
 the church was laid in 1881 and in    
 1882 the church was opened.It cost    
 Â£2012 1s 9d to build.The church is    
 made of brick and the tiles on the    
 belfrey tower are made of wood.The    
 bell is made of bronze  and the height
 to the top of the tower is 40ft.The   
 stained glass windows have all        
 different scenes of Jesus's life.     
 Normally on Sundays there are 40-50   
 people in the church.There have been 7
 vicars counting the present who is    
 called George Greenhough.This year    
 there has been an appeal to raise     
 money to replace the wooden tiles.    </content>
