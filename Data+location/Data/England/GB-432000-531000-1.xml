		<title>01BISHOP MIDDLEHAM AREA</title>
		<content> Bishop Middleham is the only village  
 that is wholly included in the survey 
 area.                                 
                                       
 The original village centred mainly   
 around the green has now expanded to  
 incorporate new housing.              
 The village has few shops,little      
 industry,an ancient church and a      
 modern primary school.                
                                       
 The surrounding countryside is almost 
 exclusively agricultural with farms   
 well distributed throughout the area. 
                                       
 Very few of the inhabitants of the    
 village are employed locally. The     
 majority travelling to the larger     
 towns and cities for their employment.
