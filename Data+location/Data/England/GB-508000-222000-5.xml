		<title>05POPE'S MEADOW/PEOPLE'S PARK</title>
		<content> Near the centre of Luton, going north,
 there is a hill. On one side is a park
 area called Pope's Meadow, on the     
 other side is People's Park. When     
 Luton had many hat factories in the   
 area these parks were for the workers.
 Pope's Meadow has trees at the top,   
 where it is very steep and then a     
 meadow where there are football       
 pitches in winter. People go there to 
 play games.                           
 People's Park also has a lot of trees 
 at the top, where it is very steep,   
 and also around the edges. It has     
 footpaths and games pitches. It has a 
 children's playground with swings and 
 roundabouts. In winter, Richmond Hill 
 School goes sledging in People's Park.
 The boys go cross country running in  
 People's Park and around Pope's       
 Meadow. We are lucky having these     
 parks so near the centre of Luton.    </content>
