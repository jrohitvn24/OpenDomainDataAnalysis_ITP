		<content>  THE MOST IMPRESSIVE BUILDING IS THE  
{CHURCH}IN ITS PEACEFUL WELL-KEPT      
 CHURCHYARD. THE RIVER USED TO FLOW    
 BESIDE THE ROAD BUT IS NOW DIVERTED.  
 THE LIST OF RECTORS GOES BACK TO THE  
 13TH CENT. BUT THE OLDEST PART OF THE 
 CHURCH IS THE 14TH CENT. TOWER WITH   
 ITS SIX BELLS. THE REST WAS REBUILT   
 AFTER A FIRE IN 1610. IT IS SIMPLE AND
 IN A TRADITIONAL MEDIEVAL STYLE AND   
 SHAPE. THERE IS A LARGE MEMORIAL TO   
 THE FREKE FAMILY IN THE CHAPEL IN THE 
 NORTH AISLE. THEY REBUILT THE CHURCH  
 BUT HAVE NOW DIED OUT AND THEIR MANOR 
 HOUSE IS RUINED. NEXT TO THE CHURCH IS
 A GROUP OF THATCHED FARM BUILDINGS    
 INCLUDING AN{ELIZABETHAN TITHE BARN,}A
{WAGONSHED}AND THE REMAINS OF A        
{DOVECOTE.}THE FARMER FINDS THEM A BIND
 AS HE IS NOT ALLOWED TO MODERNISE     
 THEM. AT THE OTHER END OF THE VILLAGE 
 THERE IS A 19TH CENT.{METHODIST CHAPEL</content>
