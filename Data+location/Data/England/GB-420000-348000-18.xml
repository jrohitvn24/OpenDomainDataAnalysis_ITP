		<title>18ATLOW VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content> The village hall is a small           
 building.It closed as a school in 1923
 and since then has served for Atlow's 
 social functions.In recent years plans
 for extensions to the hall have been  
 put forward and are now in the process
 of being carried out.The aim is to    
 enable the hall to accommodate larger 
 events.                               
 Atlow has also undergone a sizeable   
 influx of commuters,with the result   
 that individual farms have grown      
 larger but fewer in number.
