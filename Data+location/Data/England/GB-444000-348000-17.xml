		<content>  School is a happy and busy place for 
 children age 5 years to 11 years with 
 a pre-school Nursery for children aged
 three to five years.The children do a 
 lot of varied work from clay to       
 science,music to maths.We enjoy doing 
 Drama and every term each class has a 
 class assembly when we invite all the 
 mum's and dad's grandma's,grandads,   
 sisters and brothers to come and see  
 our assembly,have a cup of coffee and 
 look around classrooms and talk with  
 the teacher.We have lots of mums who  
 come in on a regular weekly basis to  
 help with all kinds of work around    
 school.We have lots of events,sports  
 days,discos for parents,social        
 evenings following for example youth  
 hostel visits.Children work very hard 
 and we are very much part of our local
 community.
