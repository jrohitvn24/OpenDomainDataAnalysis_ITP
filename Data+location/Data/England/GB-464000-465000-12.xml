		<title>12FARMING AROUND SHERIFF HUT'N</title>
		<content> Much permanent pasture still shows and
 'Rigg and Furrow'pattern of mediaeval 
 farming in small fields,but with many 
 made into larger ones,still hedged    
 though cut low by machines.Some farms 
 are worked by the owners alone,with   
 expensive machinery and casual labour 
 when needed.Some employ one or two men
 otherwise relying on contractors for  
 tilling,manuring and spraying.A racing
 stable with 50 horses in training,    
 employs 24 men on 50 acres of gallops.
 Two men still own or rent small fields
 scattered in the area.Chief crops are 
 wheat,barley,oats,oil seed rape,      
 potatoes and sugar beet.Pigs are      
 reared intensively.There are also     
 sheep,beef cattle(free range and      
 housed)and two dairy herds.           
 Old barns are being replaced by large 
 corrugated iron sheds,to house the    
 larger modern machines.               </content>
