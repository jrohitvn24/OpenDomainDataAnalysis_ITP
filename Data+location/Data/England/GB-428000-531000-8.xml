		<title>08Ferryhill Market</title>
		<content> Every Friday it is very busy in Ferry-
 hill because of the market.It is very 
 noisy with people shopping and stall  
 holders shouting things like"Lovely   
 apples only 30p a pound".As well as   
 the noise there are also lots of      
 smells.Some are nice smells like      
 flowers others are not so nice like   
 the fish or the dog food.It is also   
 very colourful.                       
 Everyone rushes about buying fruit and
 vegetables,plants and flowers,toys and
 clothes.Some stalls have very good    
 things.                               
 There is a lot of traffic in Ferryhill
 every Friday.The market starts at     
 about 8:30 and finishes at about 4    
 o'clock.
