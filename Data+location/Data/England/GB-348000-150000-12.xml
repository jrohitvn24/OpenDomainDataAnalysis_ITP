		<title>12TRANSPORT IN RODNEY STOKE</title>
		<content> Most people have access to a car for  
 travel to areas outside the Parish but
 the bus service is still important for
 a few, albeit a declining few.        
 Bristol Omnibus operates a service    
 between{Wells}and{Weston-Super-Mare   
 which passes along the A371 through   
 Rodney Stoke. In a normal summer week 
 day there are 16 buses from about 7.45
 a.m. to 9.00 p.m. so a reasonably     
 regular service is available but the  
 frequency drops in winter. A major    
 problem for local residents is the    
 volume of through traffic particularly
 lorries, and many people fear an      
 accident in the near future. Many of  
 the lorries are connected with the    
 local Mendip quarrying industry and   
 are passing to and from Westbury      
 quarry on the edge of the Mendips near
 the village.
