		<title>05LIFE OF ONE OLD MAN, HESSLE</title>
		<content> George is 85. He has lived all his    
 life in Hull. When he was 20 years    
 old, he was a stoker on a trading     
 ship. A stoker kept the fires clean in
 the boiler room and in working order  
 so that they could fuel the boilers to
 power the ship. His ship visited      
 Canada, USA,Argentina and Germany. He 
 left the ship after 7 years and became
 a roadmender in Montreal to make money
 to return home. He did so on a ship   
 called the "Empress of India". When he
 returned he obtained a job as a       
 bricklayer and joiner in a firm called
 "Dave Smith of Hessle, Building       
 Contractors". This was at the time of 
 World War II and because of his trade 
 he was made foreman of a Bomb Damage  
 team, which helped repair houses when 
 the bombs had hit them.
