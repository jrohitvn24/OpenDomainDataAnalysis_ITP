		<content>                                       
    {Peat}has been extracted from      
{Crowle Moors}now for many centuries;  
 but only quite recently has it been   
 the centre of a thriving industry. Two
 companies presently extract peat from 
 the Moors. One is a relatively small  
 concern run by Mr. Ken Crow; the other
 is part of the large Fisons           
 corporation.                          
     The{peat}is dug from the ground   
 using large mechanical diggers; it is 
 then loaded onto lorries. Ken Crow    
 then has his peat sent by road to his 
 processing plant some two miles away, 
 at Medge Hall. Fisons peat is sent to 
 the Fisons processing plant, in the   
 North Western area of this block,     
 using a{small guage railway.
