		<title>20Sparham Estates</title>
		<content> Sparham Hall is an irregular ten-bay  
 house, built in 1856 for Â£736 it      
 replaced a brick Manor House when this
 was part of the Holkham Estate. It    
 stands in its own grounds with views  
 over the River Wensum and water       
 meadows. Sparham House is a five-bay  
 Georgian House built about 1820. Both 
 these houses are homes of the Sayer   
 family, local landowners and keen     
 conservationists. In 1969 the Sayers  
 bought 20 acres of land, previously   
 worked as gravel pits, to revert the  
 area to its natural state. Leased to  
 the Norfolk Naturalists Trust, the    
 pits were flooded and now Sparham     
 Pools provides a natural habitat for  
 animals, birds, insects and flora.
