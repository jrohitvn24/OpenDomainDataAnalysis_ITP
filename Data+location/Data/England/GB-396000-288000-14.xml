		<title>14SANDWELL &amp; DUDLEY STATION</title>
		<content>  This railway station was first built 
 in 1860 as Oldbury station. It linked 
 Oldbury to Birmingham and             
 Wolverhampton. The old station was    
 demolished in 1984 and replaced by a  
 new one, re-named Sandwell and Dudley.
 Nowadays the station has three trains 
 per hour which stop. A large          
 proportion of the passengers who use  
 the station are commuters who travel  
 into Birmingham. The station handles  
 up to 500 passengers each day, except 
 at week-ends which are quieter. The   
 station does not have freight sidings 
 and therefore only handles parcel     
 freight.
