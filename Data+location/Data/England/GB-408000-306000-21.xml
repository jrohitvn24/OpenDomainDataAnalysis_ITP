<title>21Victoria Hospital - Gone!</title>
<content>The Victoria hospital was knocked down a few years ago. Houses have recently been built on the site. The new Samuel Johnson hospital on Trent Valley Road was opened in January 2007 by the Princess Royal. It encompasses x-ray, radiology, renal and a maternity unit as well as a minor injuries unit. Many people were very sad to see the 'Vic' go - there were campaigns to get it listed but this did not happen.&lt;br />
