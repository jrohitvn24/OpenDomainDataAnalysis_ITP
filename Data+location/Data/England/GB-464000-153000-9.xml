 Saint Mary's Church in the parish of  
 Basing,lies to the N.W. of the        
 village. It was originally built of   
 flint, known locally as 'Hampshire    
 Diamonds'.The walls have been rebuilt 
 of mostly red narrow brick, after the 
 Civil War.The oldest existing parts of
 the church are the Norman Arches of   
 the tower on the north and south sides
 and parts of the north wall of the    
 chancel.                              
      During the Civil War all but one 
 of the statues were smashed by the    
 Roundheads.The surviving statue of The
 Virgin Mary had been concealed by ivy.
      In the churchyard some of the    
 gravestones have skulls engraved on   
 them to mark possible victims of 'The 
 Plague'.                              
 There are no other churches in the    
 block.                                </content>
