		<title>03Shopping survey of Cranbrook</title>
		<content>Cranbrook has always been an important 
centre for trading . A market was      
originally founded in the 13th Century,
and although no longer in existence ,  
the town boasts a wide variety of shops
for its size . A survey revealed that  
most people in Cranbrook found shopping
convenient and easy despite prices for 
most goods being cheaper elsewhere .   
The International and Liptons are      
popular shops as are sweet shops , veg 
shops , and newsagents . With a wide   
variety of shops trade is good . The   
clothes shops and shoe shops tend not  
to sell many fashions for young people 
and the gift shops although selling    
nice gifts are rather expensive .      
Recently a number of farm shops have   
opened outside Cranbrook.Although some 
prices are high traders realise that   
they have to compete with the larger   
towns especially Maidstone and T.Wells </content>
