		<title>18PEACE PAGODA MILTON KEYNES</title>
		<content> Willen Peace Pagoda was started in    
 April 1979 and finished in August     
 1980. It took one year and four months
 to build. The Peace Pagoda was built  
 for the Buddhists that came to Milton 
 Keynes. It is made out of concrete but
 the pictures were carved and sent from
 India. A Japanese man called Matsuura 
 Yoshijke and his men built the pagoda.
 The buddhists use the pagoda every    
 day, usually late at night. The Peace 
 Pagoda is set by Willen Lake. It is   
 mainly white with a gpld painted      
 statue of the Buddha. The steps go up 
 in two flights; after the first there 
 is a big marbled square then more     
 stepd up to the pagoda. Just before   
 you reach the top there are two big   
 concrete lions which are very         
 attractive.
