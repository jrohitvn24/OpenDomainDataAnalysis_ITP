		<content>{Mr. Bosomworth's farm}                
 This farm is a dairy farm it has 44   
 cows and they are fresians.They are   
 thorough_bred fresians and you can    
 tell they are thorough_bred because   
 they have black legs,not black and    
 white.Mr.Bosomworth has no bulls      
 although he had 3 bulls at one        
 time.One of the bulls was slaughtered 
 as he was dangerous and since that    
 time he has not replaced the bull.The 
 cows give on average 25 litres of milk
 a day .The milking is not done by     
 hand it is done by machinery.Clusters 
 are put on the cow and these are      
 connected  by pipes to a sort of      
 metal tank.In the tank the milk is    
 kept moving and is kept at the right  
 temperature.This method of milking is 
 called "pipe_line milking ".The       
 milk_tanker arrives at about 11.00 am.
