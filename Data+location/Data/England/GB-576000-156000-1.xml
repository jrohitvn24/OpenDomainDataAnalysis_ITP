		<content>Maidstone has grown into a thriving    
commercial centre and an important     
market town from being a small river   
settlement in prehistoric times.       
Maidstone is an area of considerable   
archeological and historical           
importance. There have been remains    
found dating back to Palaelothic and   
Neolithic times.  The area includes    
part of the track known as the         
Pilgrims' Way, one of the most         
important pre-Roman roads in England.  
We also know that a Roman road ran     
through Maidstone.  The town received  
its first charter in 1549.             
MAIDSTONE'S NAME                       
The most likely origin is Anglo-Saxon. 
It was known as "Medweyestun" (Medway's
Town) and later in the Domesday Book as
"Meddestane" (The Mid-town). The name  
was later interpreted as "the town of  
the Maidens"                           </content>
