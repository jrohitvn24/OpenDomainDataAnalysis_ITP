 at 6.00pm.This is a club only for     
 girls.It is at Hellifield School.We   
 play games there and make hats and    
 things like that.Sometimes we make    
 sweets  and other times we go to the  
 Brownie Hut.                          
    On Thursday I go to the Swimming   
 Club in Settle.We swim 10 lengths     
 nearly every week.We water tread for  
 three minutes,and do other            
 activities concerned with swimming.   
    On a Saturday I go to the Skipton  
 Music Centre.Children travel to this  
 Centre from many towns and villages to
 play instruments together and make an 
 orchestra.We play a piece of music    
 called Star Gazing.
