		<content>  During the many years this area has  
 been inhabited fact and fancy have    
 become intermixed to give us a wealth 
 of legend. Secret tunnels leading from
 a prioy to the nunnery across the     
 river. Monks who had given their lives
 helping others during the plague years
 being exhumed only to haunt those who 
 dug them up.The ghost of 'Old Mo' who 
 haunts a factory so well no-one will  
 take the night shift.The last hanging 
 to take place in Lowtown was of two   
 rivermen who had killed and partly    
 eaten a foal belonging to a local     
 magistrate. The wild and bawdy life in
 the Lowtown doss-houses where life was
 cheap, as was the gin which was served
 throughout the twenty odd taverns in  
 the area.These old stories, some true,
 linger on, handed down from one       
 generation to the next.
