		<content>{    RICKFORD POND}IS A VERY DEEP      
 ONE.IT IS ABOUT 80 METRES BY 37 METRES
 AND ABOUT 4 METRES DEEP.THE WATER     
 WHICH  FILLS UP THE POND COMES OUT OF 
 THE MENDIP HILLS.IN 1968 THERE WAS SO 
 MUCH WATER THAT IT OVERFLOWED EVEN    
 WITH THE FLOOD BARRIERS OPEN.         
    THE POND HOLDS OVER 200,000 GALLONS
 AND IT WAS BUILT BEFORE THE REIGN OF  
 JAMES THE FIRST.A MILL WAS BUILT AT   
 THE SAME TIME AS THE POND.FIRST IT WAS
 A FLOUR MILL THEN A PAPER MILL.THEY   
 WERE BOTH POWERED BY THE WATER FROM   
 THE POND.THE MILL IS NOW IN RUINS BUT 
 THE MILL HOUSE IS STILL THERE.        
    THERE IS A{SMALL ISLAND}IN THE     
 MIDDLE OF THE POND. THERE ARE BIRDS   
 SUCH AS HERONS,DUCKS AND SWANS THAT   
 LIVE ON THE ISLAND.                   
     RICKFORD POND AND THE MILL HOUSE  
 ARE OFTEN USED AS SUBJECTS FOR        
 PAINTINGS AND PHOTOGRAPHS.            </content>
