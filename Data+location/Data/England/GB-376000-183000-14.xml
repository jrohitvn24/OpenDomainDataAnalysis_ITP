		<title>14GRICKSTONE FARM,HORTON</title>
		<content>    Today we went to Grickstone Farm,  
 which belongs to the Duke of Beaufort.
 The man who farms the land grows wheat
 and barley and keeps French Charollais
 and Pedigree Hampshire sheep. The     
 tenants of the house sell farm        
 machinery,keep a few pigs and sheep   
 and collect old farm implements. We   
 were shown the way to the Grickstone, 
 which is very very old, and told about
 the Long Barrow and how they found it.
 In 1890 they were ploughing the field 
 and the horse fell down a hole. They  
 found some skeletons and some pottery.
    We followed the stream through the 
 Seven Mile Plantation. In the next    
 field there was a sign in remembrance 
 of a little house where some people   
 lived who had plague a long time ago. 
    When we came to the airfield we had
 to look both ways before we crossed   
 the runway.We saw an aeroplane.       </content>
