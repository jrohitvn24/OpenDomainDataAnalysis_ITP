		<content>Codsall Gardening Society  was formed  
in 1973 by a small group of keen       
gardeners and now has 120 members. Aims
are to learn about our hobby from Talks
-sometimes on one species of plant,    
others more general, eg. diseases and  
pests. We make several visits per year 
to famous gardens or nurseries and have
been as far afield as Kew and the      
Savill Garden at Windsor. We hold one  
Flower,Fruit and Vegetable Show each   
year, with mini-competitions at        
meetings, eg. a "single Dahlia Bloom". 
The Society participates in the Best   
Kept Village Competition and has raised
money for Compton Hall Hospice.Projects
this year include planting Russell     
Lupins near Russell House in Codsall   
Square, where they originated. Last    
year we had a talk from Clay Jones of  
TV fame and hosted a visit from BBC    
Radio's "Gardeners Question Time".     </content>
