		<content>  First we went around Durweston in    
 groups looking at the houses. We went 
 around Stourpaine in the same way.    
 Four people went around farms in the  
 area. We all took a sheet home to fill
 in about our homes and our families.  
                                       
  All the pages were written by the    
 children in the top class of          
 Durweston First School.               
  We are all eight or nine years old.
