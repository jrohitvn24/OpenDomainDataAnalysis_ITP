 Holliers is situated in the N.E.      
 corner of our area in the fertile     
 Arreton valley. Owned by the Isle of  
 Wight County Council, it is used by   
 the College of Arts and Technology for
 vocational training in farming to     
 higher education students. It is      
 operated on a commercial basis and is 
 expected to be profit-making. A mixed 
 farm, it covers 80 acres divided into 
 10 fields, 3 of which are permanent   
 pasture. Crops, barley, wheat and     
 ryegrass are rotated on a 3-year      
 cycle. In 1985 18 sows, serviced by   
 1 boar, are expected to produce 300 - 
 350 piglets; 40 calves are bought each
 year and a flock of 3 rams, 100 ewes  
 and at present 140 lambs are kept.    
 These are reared to be sold to the    
 meat market.
