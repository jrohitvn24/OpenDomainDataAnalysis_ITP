{No longer is there a village school of
{Sutton, it having been closed eleven  
{years ago.                            
                                       
 The old buildings are still there     
 however and still have the charm of   
 the victorian era. They have been     
 converted very tastefully into a      
 number of private houses.             
                                       
{The children of the area, mostly of   
{agricultural workers and gamekeepers, 
{now have to take a bus ride to schools
{in Melton or Woodbridge. During       
{term-time, the service runs from the  
{gates of the schools: Kingston Middle 
{School, Woodbridge and for the older  
{ones, Farlingaye High School,         
{Woodbridge, which are themselves to   
{be reorganised very soon. }
