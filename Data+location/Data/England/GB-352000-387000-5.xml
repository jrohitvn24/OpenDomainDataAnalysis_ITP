		<content>  Most grouped settlements are to the  
 East of the area. The central areas   
 are mostly open fields with isolated  
 farms and cottages. South West Barrows
 Green district contains a group of    
 houses near the works. New estates are
 being built in Lingley Green along    
 side an area of recent large          
 bungalows, detached houses and large  
 semi detached. Older semi detached    
 houses are found near Warrington Road 
 and Friends Lane. All the above houses
 are well kept and have large gardens  
 and garages. Stocks Lane contains some
 flats, bungalows and 1930's semi -    
 detached. The area around Penketh     
 County School contains some of the    
 oldest houses. e.g. Green Bank House  
 1869.                                 
  A desirable district for commuters.
