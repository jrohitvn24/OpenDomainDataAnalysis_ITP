		<title>17EMPLOYMENT IN PAXFORD AREA</title>
		<content> In this rural area where many people  
 are retired, most of the working      
 population is employed on the land.   
 Some people are self employed, and    
 some find work in other areas. A large
 number of women in the area work.     
 Campden Food Preservation Research    
 Association, a service industry to    
 food manufacturers and processers,    
 employs 123 permanent and some        
 seasonal part time workers. A garden  
 centre, The crafts of wheelwrighting  
 and fencemaking also offer employment.
 Agricultural workers earn Â£90 for an  
 approximate 40hr. week. Many vegetable
 and fruit farmers employ students,    
 travellers and foreign immigrants from
 areas of high industrial unemployment 
 on a seasonal basis.
