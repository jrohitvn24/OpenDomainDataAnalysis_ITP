 There are no schools in either Wick   
 St. Lawrence or Kingston Seymour.     
 Until the Education act of 1944 pupils
 stayed in the same school for their   
 entire education. Older children were 
 taken out of the village to secondary 
 modern or grammer schools. Gradually  
 the village schools have been closed  
 owing to the falling school rolls and 
 the difficulties of teaching children 
 of varying ages and abilities in the  
 same classroom and the cost of upkeep 
 of the ageing schools.All the children
 are now taken out of the village to   
 bigger,more modern schools. This does 
 mean that there are more facilaties   
 and greater chances for               
 extra_curricular activities for them, 
 but it has contributed in some part to
 the break down of the tight_knit      
 village community of earlier times.   </content>
