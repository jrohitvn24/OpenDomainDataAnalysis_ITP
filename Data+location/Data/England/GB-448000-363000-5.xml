		<content> Two local people were interviewed, an 
 86 year old gentleman  and a young    
 housewife.                            
 The old gentleman said there was no   
 entertaiment at all in the area, in   
 fact the old people made their own    
 entertaiment in the Senior Citizens   
 common room attached to the new flats 
 or bungalows. There were only the pubs
 and the local club where people could 
 play 'bingo'. In the pubs the games of
 darts, dominoes and cribbage were     
 played on a competitive basis between 
 the pubs, they also had a league in   
 which points for games were added up  
 and the public house that at the end  
 of the season ended up at the top of  
 the league plus runners up received   
 money prizes plus trophies for the    
 various games and was "very           
 competitive".
