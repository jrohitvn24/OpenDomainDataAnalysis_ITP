		<title>09SWIMMING IN SCARBOROUGH</title>
		<content> As Scarborough is a seaside town it is
 not surprising that swimming is very  
 popular.Children and adults take      
 advantage of the three swimming pools 
 in the town.The Waterscene which has  
 two of the longest slides in Europe   
 offers outdoor facilities and heated  
 water.The Indoor Pool hosts the       
 Scarborough Kingfisher Club and the   
 Scarborough Amateur Swimming Club     
 whilst the south pool provides        
 facilities for holiday makers and the 
 Scarborough Long Distance Swimming    
 Club.School swimming is no longer     
 financed by the County but many       
 schools offer swimming financed by    
 voluntary subscriptions. Gladstone    
 Road Junior School has an active      
 swimming group and uses the 12m pool  
 at the North Riding College.The 8 year
 old pupils also receive basic swimming
 instruction weekly.                   </content>
