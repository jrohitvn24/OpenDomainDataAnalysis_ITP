 do their local shopping at Hartley    
 Wintney, Odiham or Fleet.{Fleet       
{Services}have a terrific passing trade
 with their various restaurants, cafes 
 &amp; shops but most of the trade within  
 the block is done in the{public houses
 &amp; restaurants.{The Beauclerk Arms     
 (which does B &amp; B) is largely pat-    
 ronised by locals but attracts other  
 people with its regular barbecues &amp; is
 very popular at Sunday lunchtime.{The 
{Barley Mow,}another Courage pub, has  
 its own cricket team &amp; is near the    
 Basingstoke Canal but trade is largely
 local.{The Plane Tree Barn}was opened 
 in 1981 &amp; has a restaurant in its C.17
 barn, also used for wedding recep-    
 tions, office lunches etc. Another    
 imported barn is the public house.    </content>
