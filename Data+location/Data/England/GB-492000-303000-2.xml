		<content> Edith Weston village is relatively    
 large.                                
 The village has a 12th century church 
 with a whipping post and a one handed 
 Commonwealth Clock.In the Church the  
 top  of the font was given to the     
 village to mark 60 years of Queen     
 Victoria's reign.                     
 It has one surgery,a primary school   
 and also a village hall which is being
 rebuilt with an extension.There are   
 two shops, one a Post Office and      
 the other a General Store.            
 Opposite the Post Office is a Silver  
 Jubilee monument placed there in      
 1977.                                 
 There was an old school now used as a 
 house.
