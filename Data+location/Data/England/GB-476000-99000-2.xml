		<content>    Chichester Harbour occupies about  
 5km of this 12km block, a salt water  
 estuary running from SW to NE, of     
 which app. 4km are sand/mud flats at  
 low tide. A deep water channel runs   
 between Stockers Sand and East Head to
 the head of the harbour, with narrower
 channels, Thorney going east of       
 Thorney Island and Bosham running N.  
 opposite Itchenor.                    
  Pilsey Island lies SE of Thorney,    
 being joined by a causeway.           
  The harbour is used mainly for       
 sailing though there is some fishing, 
 bass, mullet,plaice and flounders     
 being caught; oysters are dredged.    
  East Head, a sand dune promontory    
 managed by the National Trust, is a   
 popular anchorage for yachts and a    
 pleasant place for picnickers and is  
 also a habitat for sea and shore      
 birds. Coots and herons are seen.     </content>
