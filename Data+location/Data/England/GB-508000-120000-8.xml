		<content>  Hungerhill Farm (500 acres) on B.2139
 has an internationally known herd, the
 Hungerhill Highland Fold, largest in  
 the south of England.  The owner, Mrs 
 McPhail, is a principal breeder of the
 cattle in this country, a major prize-
 winner at Agricultural Shows, and a   
 highly esteemed judge.  She exports   
 widely to Europe.  This year she has  
 bred what is thought to be the first  
 white (not albino) Highland heifer    
 calf.  With the Highland fold of about
 95 is a pedigree Friesian dairy herd  
 of 140. The farm is on 90% Wealden    
 clay;  40% of the pasture is down to  
 winter wheat;  20% to spring wheat,   
 20-25% to barley, the rest oats.  The 
 farmhouse, probably 16th C, with      
 Horsham slab stone roof, has ancient  
 yews and acacia trees in its pleasure 
 gardens, with avenues of trees. An old
 stone quarry once yielded winklestone.</content>
