 Our area is in the Cotswold Hills.I   
 like the Cotswolds because it is      
 mostly unspoiled countryside.The hills
 are not flat but there are valleys,   
 streams and springs and it is quiet,  
 very quiet because there are not many 
 roads.There is one big main road but  
 all the others are small and winding. 
 Our area is mostly covered in fields  
 and you can see lots of animals like  
 deer, rabbits and pheasants. The      
 farmers put hay bales out for the     
 deer.There are lots of fossils.Most of
 them are prints. I love the country.I 
 would not leave it for anything.
