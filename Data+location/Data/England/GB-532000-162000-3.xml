		<title>03A S.CROYDON CHILD</title>
		<content> A typical child from the Ridgeway     
 School,Sanderstead, lives in a        
 semi_detached home with double        
 glazing,central heating,T.V.,a washing
 machine and tumble drier.His parents  
 have one or two cars.                 
 It is likely that his father works in 
 some type of engineering or finance in
 London,and ,if his mother works,it is 
 probably locally doing secretarial    
 work.                                 
 There may be only two children in the 
 family,and they have many hobbies and 
 interests.About half of them will play
 a musical instrument,have swimming    
 lessons and be in the cubs or         
 brownies.They will enjoy all          
 sports,and will watch television about
 10 hours a week if in the first year, 
 and 18 hours a week in the third year.
