 Smalley Richardson Endowed Primary    
 School is its full name and it teaches
 children up to the age of 11 when they
 transfer to Heanor Gate School.  The  
 school is of red brick, was built in  
 the nineteenth century and has a      
 playgrond at the front.  One teacher  
 said it was the right size for the    
 village, that it was a very friendly  
 school with hardly any violence.      
 Certainly we found the children were  
 very happy at their work. There was   
 once a separate infant school in the  
 village but this was closed a few     
 years ago and the building is used as 
 a community hall.                     
{SHOPS}                                
 There are four shops in Smalley       
 1) The post office and grocery shop (R
 Hughes).  This shop is at the north   
 end of the village.                   </content>
