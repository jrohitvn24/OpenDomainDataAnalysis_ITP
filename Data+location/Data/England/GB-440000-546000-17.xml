		<title>17HOUSING IN SEAHAM.</title>
		<content> MUCH OF THE RESIDENTAL AREAS OF SEAHAM
 IS TAKEN UP BY THE OLDER FASHIONED    
 TYPE OF COLLIERY TERRACED HOUSE.IN    
 DAWDON,SEAHAM HARBOUR AND NORTHLEA    
 THESE HOUSES SPRING OUT FROM THE      
 COLLIERIES IN LONG ROWS.THEY ARE VERY 
 OLD HOUSES BUT ARE STILL EXTREMELY    
 STURDY AND MANY PEOPLE HAVE MADE      
 MARVELOUS MODERNISATIONS.THERE ARE    
 MANY ESTATES OF COUNCIL HOUSES,THE    
 MOST MODERN AND SOUGHT AFTER BEING IN 
 NORTHLEA ESTATE.BECAUSE SEAHAM IS     
 SURROUNDED BY A "GREEN BELT" ON THREE 
 SIDES,MORE HOUSING ESTATES ARE        
 SPRINGING UP ON THE OUTSKIRTS.AT      
 DALDEN HEIGHTS PEOPLE HAVE HAD HOUSES 
 DESIGNED TO THEIR OWN SPECIFICATIONS  
 AND HAVE DONE MUCH OF THE BUILDING    
 THEMSELVES OR WITH THE HELP OF        
 FRIENDS.IT IS PROPOSED TO HAVE MORE OF
 THESE HOUSES TO THE EAST AND SOUTH OF 
 SEAHAM.                               </content>
