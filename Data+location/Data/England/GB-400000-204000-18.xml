		<title>18PRIMARY SCHOOL, CIRENCESTER.</title>
		<content>  A primary school day starts at 09.00 
 and ends at 15.40. We have two breaks 
 one at 10.45 until 11.00. The other   
 one is  from midday until 13.25.      
 During that time we eat our lunch. We 
 have a maths lesson every morning, and
 P.E. every day. We write a story once 
 a week. There are six classes in the  
 school, 5 of the teachers are ladies  
 the other is a man, We also have a    
 headmaster. There are about 29        
 children in each class.               
  Our school uniform is a grey or navy 
 blue skirt for the girls, grey or     
 black trousers for the boys. Grey,    
 white, or shirt for everyone,         
 with a plain jumper on top. We only   
 wear school uniform for special       
 occasions like music concerts, carol  
 service or harvest festival.
