		<title>02HOME FARM - PARKS</title>
		<content> The Parks at{Hutton}extend to 210     
 acres and abut the eastern, southern  
 and western edges of the Hall grounds.
 They are split into 4 parts.  The     
 largest and most easterly, known as   
 the 'Big Park', extends to 137 acres. 
 It is split by the deep valley of the 
 River Petteril and contains a number  
 of mature trees, especially oak.  A   
 number of plantings have been carried 
 out to replace existing trees and to  
 provide habitats.  It is used for hay,
 and as grazing for ewes, lambs and    
 dairy replacements.   The remaining   
 three areas are more or less the same 
 size and also contain park trees and  
 again some plantings have been        
 established.  One area adjacent to the
 dairy unit is grazed by dairy cows,   
 and the two others, next to the Hall, 
 are grazed by ewes, lambs and dairy   
 heifers.                              </content>
