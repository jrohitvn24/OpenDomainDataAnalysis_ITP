		<title>18Car and People Count</title>
		<content> On July 1st Crispin,Andrew and I went 
 into the school courtyard which is at 
 the front of our school,to count cars 
 and other motor vehicles that passed  
 Church Road.We counted for an hour.In 
 that time 510 vehicles passed by.We   
 then multiplied this number by 24,and 
 found that in one day 6,120 motor     
 vehicles on average would pass by our 
 school.The next day we went to Rectory
 Road to see how many people I saw walk
 down the road.Owen was counting cars.I
 saw 102 people walk down Rectory Road.
 Owen saw 82 cars go by.Down Rectory   
 Road there is the library,the Rectory,
 our school back entrance and some     
 houses.Rectory Road is a lot more     
 peaceful than Church Road.            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
