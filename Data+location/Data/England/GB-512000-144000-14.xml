		<content> On the Western edge of the block is a 
 house known as "Goddards" which was   
 built in l899 and extended in l9l0.   
 The architect was the great Edwin     
 Lutyens  (who was 30 in l899).  He was
 inspired by Stokesay Castle and The   
 Prior's Lodge at Much Wenlock Priory  
 (both in Shropshire),                 
                                       
 A great deal of matured older         
 material was used in the building -   
 e.g. the traditional Horsham slabs for
 the roof, brought from Slinfold,      
 together with two l7th Century barns  
 from there and an old waggon house    
 from Horsham Brewery.                 
                                       
                                       
 The gardens were designed by Gertrude 
 Jekyll - the sunken stone gardens were
 considered as part of the house.  As
