		<content>    The housing in Wickham Skeith and  
Stoke Ash is a mixture of old and new  
buildings.There are several interesting
old buildings.                         
    There is a house in Wickham Skeith 
called Mill House.The doorsteps are    
millstones.It was built in 1648.The    
oldest house in the village is a       
farmhouse.In one of the bedrooms there 
is soot which has appeared on the wall 
because there used to be an old chimney
stack there.                           
    In Stoke Ash there is a farm called
Low Farm.When we did our survey        
there,we didn't knock on the door      
because we knew the people there had   
some black labradors!                  
    The oldest house is about 450 years
old.The newest house was built in      
1984. In Wickham Skeith there is a     
house which used to be a school.It     
closed in 1947.                        </content>
