		<title>17Seaweed Fertilizer,Wiltshire</title>
		<content>   My name is Mark Edgcumbe,I live in  
 Calne.I am writing about my father's  
 interesting job.SEAMAC is where my    
 father works,in Chippenham.He is the  
 manager of the factory.Six other      
 people work there too.                
   They make fertilizer out of seaweed.
 It is most unusual.All the seaweed    
 comes from Scotland,on big lorries.It 
 goes into a heater.Then the hot       
 seaweed goes into a press and the     
 juice drips out into a tray.          
   After that the mulch is put into    
 bags and the juice is put into drums. 
   It is sent off to farmers all over  
 the British Isles and overseas.       
   At the moment one bag costs about 15
 pounds.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
