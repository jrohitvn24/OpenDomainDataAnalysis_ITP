		<content> I interviewed the man who looks       
 after the graveyard. We asked him what
 was in the little shed and he told us 
 he kept his lawnmowers in it. He is   
 employed by the Parish Council and has
 done this work for three years. Not   
 many people are buried there, about   
 five a year. Some are family graves.  
 In November 1984 there was so much    
 rain the graves sank so more soil had 
 to put on top.There are thirty eight  
 trees down the middle of the          
 graveyard. It takes two days to prune 
 the trees. There is some ground at the
 back of the graveyard that is not     
 being used.
