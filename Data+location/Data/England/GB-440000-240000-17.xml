		<title>17Wroxton Abbey 1933-1985</title>
		<content>Up until 1933 the Abbey was the home of
the Pope and North family. In 1963 the 
Abbey and 56 acres of grounds were     
bought by the Fairleigh Dickinson      
University of New Jersey U.S.A. It was 
in a very bad state of repair and had  
to undergo extensive repairs before it 
was ready to receive students in 1965. 
In 1973 the University received a gift 
of money which allowed it to convert   
the stable and carriage block into     
sleeping accommodation, kitchens and   
dining rooms. In 1975 a car park was   
created and in 1982 a lodge at the     
entrance to the Abbey was restored.    
From 1978 to 1982 150,000 pounds was   
spent on restoring the stonework, and  
re-roofing. This was paid for by the   
help of a 44% grant from the Historic  
Buildings Council.
