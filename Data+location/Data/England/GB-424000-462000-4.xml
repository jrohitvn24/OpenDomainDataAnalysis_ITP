{Doctors have become concerned about   
{our diet because of the increase in   
{the number of deaths due to heart     
{disease. We have found out that most  
{of our 25 children eat a good balanced
{diet.}4 children sometimes eat        
 vegetarian meals but most children eat
 meat or fish and vegetables and fruit 
 every day. 4 children eat only white  
 bread, 8 children eat both white and  
 brown bread but 13 children eat only  
 fibre enriched wholemeal bread every  
 day. Our favourite fruit is banana and
 our favourite vegetables are          
 cauliflower and peas. We found out    
 that 9 children go to bed before 7.30 
 and 2 children go to bed at 9.30 but  
 most go to bed about 8.30. 7 parents  
 smoke cigarettes which is very bad for
 their health but we are trying to     
 persuade them to stop.                </content>
