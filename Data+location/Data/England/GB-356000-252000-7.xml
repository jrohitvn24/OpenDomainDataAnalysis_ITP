		<title>07Ecology in Pencombe</title>
		<content> In the past little thought seems to   
 have been given to ecology. Nowadays  
 we are very much aware of the         
 importance of retaining what we have. 
 Hedges are less frequently torn up to 
 create larger fields and we are       
 encouraged to leave plots of land     
 uncultivated to give nature a         
 chance. More effort is now made to    
 retain the beauty of the countryside. 
 There is still plenty of wildlife     
 around us and seen recently are       
 otters, badgers, foxes, hares,        
 rabbits, stoats, weasels, moles, rats 
 and various mice and voles. Birdlife  
 is abundant. Care taken not to pollute
 ground and surface water means that   
 fish, frogs and newts (local dialect: 
 adzels) are to be found in the stream 
 in Pencombe. Trees are preserved      
 wherever possible and replaced when   
 felled.                               </content>
