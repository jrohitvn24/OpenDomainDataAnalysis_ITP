People living here seem generally      
concerned with rural matters and the   
preservation of the countryside, either
because they are involved with farming 
or because they choose to live in this 
rather isolated area.  The nearby      
U.S.A.F. Bases of Bentwaters and       
Woodbridge, however, make a direct     
impact upon the people in contradictory
ways. There is some resentment         
concerning the high noise level of     
aircraft, and the increased volume of  
traffic on the road, as well as the    
pressure on housing.  Even in this     
isolated area with a total of 26       
dwellings, 4 American Service personnel
live.  On the other hand, people are   
generally pleased about the employment 
generated by the presence of the Base  
(some English people living in this    
area work on the Base).                </content>
