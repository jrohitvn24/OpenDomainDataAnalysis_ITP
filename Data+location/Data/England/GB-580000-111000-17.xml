		<title>17My Family's Life Styles</title>
		<content> My family came from Wembley about 12  
 years ago,so that my dad could go     
 round mending cookers and washing     
 machines and micro-waves etc.He has a 
 van and it says T.I. Creda (T.I.means 
 "Trust It.")                          
    My mum and my sister work in rest  
 homes for the elderly.Old people      
 pay to live in such buildings         
 where they are looked after by the    
 owner and his staff or by a warden.   
  I am mad on football.  I play for    
 Hastings Town Football Club and       
 Spartans Football Club.I also         
 go to Hollington Youth Centre,and do  
 break dancing.I can do handspins,     
 headspins, donkey kicks,windmills,    
 caterpillars, turtles,backspins, knee 
 spins,crazy legs, swipes and halos.   
 These are all names given to ways of  
 moving acrobatically to modern beat   
 music.                                </content>
