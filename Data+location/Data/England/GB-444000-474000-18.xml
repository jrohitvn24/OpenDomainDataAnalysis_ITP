		<title>18SESSAY  -  TRANSPORT ?</title>
		<content> Possession of a{car}is becoming an    
 essential of village life and Sessay  
 is no exception.  Hutton Sessay is    
 only a short walk, albeit uphill, from
 a regular{'bus service}to most nearby 
 towns.  From Sessay however, apart    
 from the school 'bus, there are only  
 three services per week, two of which 
 run on Mondays to Thirsk - also our   
 nearest railway station.              
 However{mobile services}can provide   
 the necessities of life. Butcher,baker
 fishmonger and general store all call 
 at least once a week; a mobile library
 comes once a fortnight, and Sessay has
 a Post Office. In Summer such services
 are supplemented by a shop at the     
 caravan site and fresh produce avail- 
 able at the two market gardens which, 
 ironically, draw people from the towns
 to shop in the country :-             
{but only of course if they have a car!</content>
