 The farm has 7 fields for cows. Cows  
 give 4 gallons of milk each every day.
 The cows are milked twice a day,      
 morning and evening. The farmer buys  
 Friesian cows from Congleton          
 Market. He keeps the cows for 8 years 
 until they stop giving so much milk.  
 Then he sells his cows at Chelford    
 Market. The farmer has 60 cows        
 altogether. The cows give 190 gallons 
 of milk every day. The farmer gives   
 them silage and corn and straw to eat.
 They need to have a calf every year   
 and then they will give milk for 10   
 months. The farmer puts red tape on   
 the tails of the cows which are       
 resting, before they have their next  
 calf .
