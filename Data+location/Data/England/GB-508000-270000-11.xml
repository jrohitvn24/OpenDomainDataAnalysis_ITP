		<title>11EDUCATION IN WEST CAMBS.</title>
		<content>  Neither Stow Longa nor Catworth has a
 village school, but special buses     
 are provided to take pupils to schools
 in other towns and villages. Children 
 between the ages of five and eleven   
 attend the village primary schools at 
 Brington, Spaldwick or Kimbolton,     
 travelling a maximum of 6 kilometres. 
 For their secondary education, pupils 
 transfer to the larger comprehensive  
 schools, farther away at Huntingdon or
 St. Neots.                            
                                       
                                       
    A significant minority of parents  
 choose to send their children to      
 Kimbolton School, an independent fee- 
 paying school for children between the
 ages of eight and eighteen.   Some    
 families have moved into the area to  
 live near Kimbolton School, a trend   
 which has inflated house prices.      </content>
