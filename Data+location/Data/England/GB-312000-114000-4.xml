		<content> Ashculm Turbary is a common of 6.572  
 hectares leased at nominal rent from  
 Parish Council and managed as a nature
 reserve by the Devon Trust for Nature 
 Conservation. Peat was dug here until 
 it was worked out about 100 years ago.
 The Reserve is designated by the      
 Nature Conservancy Council as of      
 special Scientific Interest. Habitats 
 range from acid bog to wet heath,     
 birch scrub elder and willow carr. The
 aim of management is to maintain range
 of habitat for plants and animals.    
 This involves planned cutting of      
 scrub. Experiments in progress show   
 that the number of species increases  
 spectacularly when an area dominated  
 by Molinia grass is close cut yearly. 
 A small plot skinned of vegetation has
 provided an open habitat now being    
 colonised by some uncommon plants     
 which were endangered species.        </content>
