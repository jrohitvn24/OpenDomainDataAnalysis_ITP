		<content> These are the views expressed by Mrs. 
 Sage during an interview with her.    
                                       
   In the past there was more{community
{life.}People lived, worked and shopped
 in the village. This has declined due 
 to the many{commuters}but there is    
 still a good{community spirit.}I      
 accept the fact that people want to   
 move out into the country and although
 some are not interested in{village    
{life}many are. I think people have an 
 obligation to support the village in  
 which they live. {                    
{                                      
   I think the "values" have gone. In  
 the past people where more            
 conscientious and had a better sense  
 of right and wrong.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
