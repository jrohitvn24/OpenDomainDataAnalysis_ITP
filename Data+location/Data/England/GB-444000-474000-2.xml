		<content> The main acreage of old established   
 woodland, conifers and birch, is Clark
 Wood, but it was reduced from 73 acres
 to 21 acres in 1984.                  
{FLORA:}primroses, bluebells, dog      
 violets, a few cowslips and a wide    
 variety in roadsides and hedges.  The 
 fields are mainly cleared by selective
 weedkillers.                          
{FAUNA:}plenty of deer, foxes, rabbits,
 hares, grey squirrels and hedgehogs.  
{CULTIVATED FIELDS:}grassland,         
 cereals, potatoes, sugarbeet, also    
 some acreage of soft fruit.           
{CLIMATE:}humid temperate area but can 
 be subject to fog. Generally mild     
 winters. High winds mainly from west  
 but some protection by trees and      
 hedges and where not protected the    
 soil tends to blow in dry weather in  
 spring.
