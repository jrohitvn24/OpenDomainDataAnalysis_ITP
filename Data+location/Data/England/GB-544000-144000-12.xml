		<title>12STAGE SCHOOL</title>
		<content>    I have recently left{stage school }
 where you sing and dance. The day     
 starts at 9.30 and ends at 3.30 p.m.  
 In the morning we do the traditional  
 school lessons, but after dinner we   
 change into our dancing gear and      
 limber up. We normally start with{    
{ballet}initially doing bar exercises  
 followed by work in the middle of the 
 floor. Secondly, we do{tap dancing}   
 followed by{modern dancing.}After a   
 short break, the afternoon proceeds   
 with a session of acting, singing,    
 drama and stagework. The day is       
 finished by discussing acting and     
 television work and then we all go    
 home. A great deal of time is also    
 spent rehearsing and performing       
 productions...by Susan Aylward.
