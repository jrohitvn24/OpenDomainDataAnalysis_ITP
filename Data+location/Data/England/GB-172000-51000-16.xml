		<content>  THE BUS SERVICE PASSES THROUGH THE   
 AREA FOUR TIMES DAILY  AND TWICE      
 AT WEEKENDS. MOST OF THE PEOPLE OWN   
 THEIR OWN CAR, MOTERBIKE, TRUCK OR    
 BICYCLE.THE NEAREST TRAIN STATION IS  
 AT TRURO WHICH IS 14 KILOMETRES AWAY. 
 THERE WAS ONCE A RAILWAY LINE RUNNING 
 FROM ST.AGNES TO PERRANPORTH AND THEN 
 TO TRURO. IN THE SIXTIES IT BECAME    
 DISUSED AND ITS SURROUNDINGS ARE NOW  
 OVERGROWN GRASSLANDS.THOUGH PUBLIC    
 TRANSPORT IS VERY LIMITED PEOPLE DO   
 NEED TO TRAVEL BECAUSE AMENITIES,SUCH 
 AS SHOPS, THEATRES, AND PUBLIC        
 SERVICES ARE ALSO VERY LIMITED IN THE 
 IMMEDIATE AREA.
