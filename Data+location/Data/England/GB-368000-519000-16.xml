		<title>16Appleby Cub Pack</title>
		<content>    The Cubs are very  popular in      
 Appleby because almost every time you 
 go to Cubs you engoy yourself .But    
 as well as enjoying yourself you also 
 earn badges.I have done between 5 and 
 10 badges at Cubs I enjoyed doing     
 the cookery badge because I like the  
 smell of the food.Our main leader is  
 Joyce Brockbank who we call Akela.    
    The Cub hut is quite small but it  
 seems bigger on the inside. It has a  
 kitchen,a toilet,and a hall where we  
 play the games.We also earn ourselves 
 badges eg,atheletes badge-jump one    
 metre run 80 metres in a certain time.
    We play good games at Cubs such as 
 British Bulldogs.We have to run to the
 other side of the room without being  
 caught.If the person who is it manages
 to lift you fully off the ground then 
 you are a bulldog as well until       
 everybody is caught.Carl Sowerby      </content>
