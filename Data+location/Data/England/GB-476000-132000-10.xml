		<content> Large parts of our D-block are covered
 with swamp, heath-land, and wood-land.
 There are many wild deer, foxes,      
 rabbits and snakes. This area is      
 particularly famous for the Natterjack
 Toad. This toad has become so rare    
 that it is now an endangered species. 
 Several of the roads have signs with a
 picture of a toad to warn motorists.  
 The natterjack toad lives in sandy    
 places and buries itself during the   
 day. It does not hop like a frog, but 
 walks about on all four legs.It is    
 green in colour and has warts all over
 its back.                             
 There are many different types of bird
 living in the woods. There are other  
 kinds that live in the open           
 farmland.There are both coniferous and
 deciduous trees. The soil is rather   
 acid in places so rhododendrons grow  
 well.                                 </content>
