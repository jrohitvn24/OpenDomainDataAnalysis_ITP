		<title>06Playing in the Band</title>
		<content>   Our band was started three years ago
 by two men called Brian Stephenson and
 Rex Spiller. The band started off with
 six members but now there are fifty   
 four players. Some are from{          
{Christchurch}and the rest are from{   
{Ringwood.                             
{ }Every weekend in the summer season  
 we go out to{carnivals, fetes}and{    
{competitions.}Besides this we practise
 three times a week so the band is     
 taking over my life.                  
   Our{uniform}is black skirt or trou- 
 sers, a red shirt, white waist-band   
 and red sash, white cravat, white     
 socks and white plimsolls. The girls  
 wear mink colour tights.              
   The band is called the{Christchurch 
{and District Marching Youth Band}also 
 known as the{Scarlet Imperials.}
