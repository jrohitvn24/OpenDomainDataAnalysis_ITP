		<title>12Sport in Framlingham.</title>
		<content>Framlingham Sports Club was founded in 
1947,and there are about 350 members.  
There are seven different sections:    
badminton,cricket, croquet, hockey,    
rifle range, soccer and tennis.        
Framlingham Sports Club owns 15 acres, 
to the east of the town.The main fund  
raising event is the annual Gala and   
other events like car-boot-sales and   
jumble sales are held.The money goes   
towards providing and maintaining club 
equipment. Current major projects are  
the surfacing of 3 hard tennis courts  
and the building of a store for the    
tractors and other equipment. Each     
section has to provide smaller items   
for itself, contribute a sum to the    
general Sports Club funds as well as   
supporting fund rasing efforts. All the
sections compete in local leagues      
except the quite newly formed croquet  
section for older members.             </content>
