		<title>12   Anderson Manor.</title>
		<content>        Anderson Manor was built in    
 1622 by John Tregonwell. In those days
 it had a farm and stables and many    
 servants. Now my family owns the      
 house and I live in it with my parents
 and my two brothers. The stables are  
 now a holiday cottage and the farm    
 belongs to somebody else. We own three
 big fields and have some cattle on    
 them. The gardens are about 80 years  
 old and are surrounded by old walls   
 and yew hedges. There is a Dutch      
 garden with small box hedges and a    
 bowling green and a Ladies walk with  
 roses. We sometimes feed sheep in the 
 orchard. The church is part of the    
 Manor and my brothers and I were      
 christened there. My name is Morwenna 
 Isaac.
