		<title>04Amenities in Lawhitton</title>
		<content>    The population of Lawhitton is     
 about 110.There are few amenities in  
 Lawhitton.Transport is very poor.     
 There  are no buses except those      
 which take the children to school in  
 Launceston.  People in the area need a
 car if they are to get anywhere. Most 
 people believe that there should be a 
 better service. In Lawhitton there    
 isn't a shop or a Post Office. The    
 Post Office closed a few years ago    
 because it was uneconomical. To go    
 shopping most people come into        
 Launceston.There is a beautiful church
 in Lawhitton which was built in the   
 twelfth century. It has a very large  
 graveyard. Most inhabitants of        
 Lawhitton like the peaceful atmosphere
 but the younger people wish there was 
 more to do.
