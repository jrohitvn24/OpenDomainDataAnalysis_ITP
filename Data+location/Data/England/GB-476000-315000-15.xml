		<content> The styles and ages of the buildings  
 in Burton Lazars varies               
 considerably.The materials include    
 brick,stone,wood,slate,tile and       
 thatch.The church is part Norman while
 the newest building is still under    
 construction.Some buildings display an
 interesting combination of different  
 styles and materials.One in particular
 including stone,concrete and brick    
 (both bare and painted and in various 
 bonds).                               
  Previous uses of some of the older   
 buildings can be detected from their  
 names.For instance a bakery and       
 stables.Other information to be found 
 in house names includes a reminder of 
 the area's strong hunting associations
 in the two neighbouring pairs of      
 houses named after the four famous    
 local hunts (Belvoir, Cottesmore,     
 Fernie and Quorn.)                    </content>
