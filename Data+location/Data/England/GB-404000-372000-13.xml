		<title>13Buxton:Rail Transport.</title>
		<content> Buxton has an hourly train service to 
 and from Manchester. During the       
 morning and evening periods the trains
 run every half hour. People going to  
 work, students, schoolchildren,       
 shoppers, and tourists use the train, 
 and it is important in the Buxton     
 winter when the roads are blocked by  
 snow and ice.                         
  Buxton people also work on the       
 mineral railways which take stone away
 from Hindlow, Topley Pike and Tunstead
 Quarries. The line to Hindlow crosses 
 the Buxton streets on a mighty        
 viaduct.                              
  Peak Rail is a private steam railway 
 which is growing at the old Midland   
 Station. In 1985 they have some small 
 working steam locomotives,and some    
 larger ones they hope to restore.They 
 want to run trains on the old route to
 Matlock.                              </content>
