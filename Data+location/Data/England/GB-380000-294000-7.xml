		<title>07EMPLOYMENT NEAR SEISDON</title>
		<content>   Undoubtedly the major occupation in 
this area is farming, though as most of
the farms are family ones they do not  
employ many other people.  Horticulture
also accounts for a number of jobs both
in growing and dealing with the public.
A few part-time jobs occur in the local
public houses and restaurant.          
   Probably the largest employer is the
Egg Packing Station at Seisdon, though 
the majority of its employees are      
brought in by car from the             
Wolverhampton area and there is little 
employment there for local people      
except for the "Sunday girls".         
   Other people living in this area,   
parcularly the younger ones have to    
travel some distance to work, probably 
in Bridgnorth or Wolverhampton.  There 
unemployment is very high and it may be
difficult to obtain work at all.
