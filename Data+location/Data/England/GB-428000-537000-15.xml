		<content> In September I am going to Whinney    
 Hill Comprehensive which is in Durham 
 but really I do not want to go because
 I like this school better.Also the    
 worst thing is that we have to wear a 
 school uniform.The girls have to wear 
 a navy blazer (or black),a white      
 blouse,but with that blouse you must  
 wear a school tie.With a blue blouse  
 you cannot wear a tie.The best thing  
 that you can do is C.D.T.,which is    
 woodwork,metalwork and cookery.Also   
 you have two seperate yards one for   
 the girls and the other one is the    
 boys.First time I did not want to go  
 but now I can't wait,the girls have to
 wear a flared skirt but all the in our
 class are not wearing one.Sometimes in
 Whinney Hill they have discos.you can 
 get the uniform from Parkins and R.M.K
 &amp; Fashions.
