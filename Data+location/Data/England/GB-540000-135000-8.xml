 The area is served by 2 churches.One  
 is St.Dunstan's, Ashurstwood, and the 
 other is Holy Trinity,Forest Row.There
 were 2 churches in Ashurstwood until  
 1973 when the Congregational Church   
 was shut.This was bought by the       
 Anglian Church and it was re-dedicated
 as St.Dunstan's in Sept.1979.The      
 church is well attended by families   
 and the elderly but young people on   
 their own tend to shy away. The same  
 is true at the Holy Trinity Church.   
 This church was built in 1836. This   
 can seat 350 people.                  
 A Christian Community was established 
 in Ashurstwood in 1954 and it moved to
 its present site ,The Barn,Woodshill  
 Lane, in 1964.
