		<content> Many of the people we talked to were  
 old and had grown up families.Most of 
 them had lived in South Mimms for over
 twenty years and some had been born in
 the village.Many of them had family   
 connection in the area although some  
 had originally moved there because of 
 their job.Most of those interviewed   
 thought there was not much to do in   
 the immediate area especially for     
 young people but that you could soon  
 get to the sports facilities in       
 Potters Bar,Borehamwood or Barnet if  
 you had a car.The only other social   
 activities mentioned seemed to revolve
 around the family or visits to local  
 pubs.Older inhabitants said they      
 didn't leave the village often and    
 preferred gardening and a quiet       
 lifestyle.
