 reference to a church on this site is

 is a monument to Sir William Cecil, a 
 local court member, who died in 1599

 probably one of the churches in the   
 domesday book. The spire is 152ft high
 ST JOHNS CHURCH This is in the        
 perpendicular style of the 14th-15th  
 century. It is similar to St. Martins 
 ST MICHAELS CHURCH A church stood here
 from 1158, but it has recently been   
 closed down due to the movement of    
 population away from the centre, and  
 it has been sold for redevelopment.   
 ST MARYS CHURCH The earliest records  
 of this church date back to 1146. The 
 tower and spire cannot fail to awaken 
 admiration.The roof is also very fine.</content>
