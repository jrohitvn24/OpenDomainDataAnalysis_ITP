 international airport in the{North    
{East,}it plays a vital role in the    
 communication and economic growth of  
 the region.                           
                                       
{Newcastle Airport}was opened on July  
 1935 by Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister,   
 the secretary of state for air.  Now

 50th birthday.  It also was a dream   
 come true for Newcastle's former{Lord 
{Mayor}Sir Stephen Easton, chairman of 
 the Municipal Aerodromes Special      
 Committee because it took him 6 years 
 to persuade his colleagues in the city
 council that spending a total of 35   
 million on a{City Airport}would not be
 a waste of money.                     </content>
