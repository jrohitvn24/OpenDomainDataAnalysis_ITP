		<title>08Gt.Coxwell's Agriculture.</title>
		<content> The agricultural land belongs mainly  
 to 8 farms,the largest proportion be- 
 ing National Trust tenancies.There is 
 only one dairy herd,the other farms   
 having beef cattle &amp; one herd of pigs.
 (Twenty years ago there were at least 
 three lots of milking cows).          
 Less milking cows have led to reduced 
 pasture and more arable land.This is a
 result of Common Market Policies,e.g. 
 the milk quota etc.                   
 The first cut of grass is mainly used 
 for silage and the second for hay,    
 weather permitting.                   
 The arable crops are wheat,barley,a   
 little maize and some potatoes.       
 There is a plantation of larch and    
 other conifers on land owned by the   
 National Trust,and partly managed by  
 the Forestry Commission.
