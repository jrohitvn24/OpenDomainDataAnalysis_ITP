		<title>18A CHILD'S DAY IN CLITHEROE</title>
		<content>    My day usually starts at 8.00 a.m. 
 I go downstairs and have my           
 breakfast, then get dressed ready for 
 school. My mum comes downstairs after 
 me and makes my packed_lunch. I get my
 bags ready. Today is Thursday so I do 
 not need anything special.            
    When I get to school me and three  
 other girls have to line up the       
 infants and send them in. There is    
 no assembly this morning so we get on 
 with our work straight away. We       
 usually do S.M.P. in the morning. At  
 10.00 a.m. we have our music lesson   
 then we go out to play. Straight after
 dinner we have assembly, we usually   
 have a radio programme.               
    After school I go to the Music     
 Centre this finishes at 6.00 p.m. When
 I get home I have my tea then play out
 for a while. Usually I watch Top of   
 the Pops then get ready for bed.      </content>
