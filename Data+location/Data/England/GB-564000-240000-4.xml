 Virgin dates from the eleventh        
 century.Some of the narrow round      
 topped windows are typical of the     
 period around the{Norman Conquest.}   
 Some of the church was built between  
 1350 and 1450 in the {Early           
{Perpendicular}style of architecture.  
 The church  is built of brick and     
 flint.Inside there are vaults below   
 the east end of both aisles,and       
 members of the {Gent}family of Moyns  
 Park and the {Bendyshe}family of Bower
 Hall are buried in them. Stone corbels
 supporting the main beams of the nave 
 are carved in the form of various     
 heads.There is also some {medieval    
{graffiti}on the clunch piers in the   
 arcading of the nave. The church has  
 a tower. A folk poem tells of the     
 destruction of the steeple by a storm.
