		<content>White Lodge, perched on a hillock near 
the middle of Richmond Park, has been  
called "a small architectural treasure 
- a miniature palazzo with Palladian   
portico and spacious garden." It was   
built in 1729 as a hunting lodge for   
George 1 and enlarged for later        
Sovereigns. It still belongs to the    
Crown. Queen Victoria and Prince       
Albert were in residence there from    
time to time; the Duke of Windsor was  
born there and finally King George 6th 
and Queen Elizabeth lived there as     
Duke and Duchess of York.  In 1955 the 
Royal Ballet School aquired it as a    
Junior Boarding School, to replace the 
day school at Barons Court. Now the    
children aged 11-16 were put in this   
villa, most of them as boarders. As    
well as intensive ballet training they 
receive general education up to "O"    
level examinations.  (continued over)  </content>
