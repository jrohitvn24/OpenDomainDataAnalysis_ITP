		<title>17Hinton St George Village</title>
		<content> Hinton is a peaceful village. The     
 houses are mostly terraced but there  
 are some big detached houses here as  
 well. Some houses have steps at the   
 front door that have a dip in the     
 stone step where people over the years
 have stepped on them to go into the   
 house. Many of the houses in Hinton   
 are cottages built of hamstone with   
 thatched roofs. Some of the newer     
 houses are built of concrete blocks   
 with tiled roofs. Hinton is a quiet   
 old village but these new houses fit  
 in with the old cottages. Hinton is   
 quite a safe place to play, not like  
 towns that have cars going through    
 them all the time. I think Hinton is a
 very picturesque village.
