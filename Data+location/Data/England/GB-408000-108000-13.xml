		<content> The 'Viewpoint Magazine' was started  
 by the Parish Council to help everyone
 know what was going on in the parish  
 of Verwood. It has letters from       
 residents, advertisements, a village  
 diary, stories and news from the      
 village organisations and the Parish  
 Council. There is an editor, a paster 
 and there are other committee members.
 It is published once a month and costs
 30p. The committee organise a village 
 concert once a year, when people from 
 the village take part. The profits    
 help towards the cost of the magazine.
 The local churches publish their own  
 magazines about all their activities. 
 A Verwood and Three Legged Cross Guide
 is published annually. Some local     
 history has been recorded in three    
 booklets: Verwood and District        
 Potteries - A Brief History of Verwood
 - Verwood Church School 1847 to 1985. </content>
