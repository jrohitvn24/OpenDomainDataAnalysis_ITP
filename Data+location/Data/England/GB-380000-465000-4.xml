		<title>04LANGCLIFFE: MISCELLANY</title>
		<content> Langcliffe is a small village near to 
 the town of Settle in the Yorkshire   
 Dales. The village looks old, but     
 there is evidence that there was an   
 even earlier Langliffe which was      
 burned by the Scots. The present      
 village was apparently built further  
 up the valley. Cotton mills once      
 provided work for the people of       
 Langcliffe, but when these fell into  
 disuse in the middle of the 19th      
 century, Langcliffe became for a short
 time like a deserted village. The     
 mills became paper mills, and provided
 employment once more. In the centre of
 the village is a tree, called 'The    
 Tree' by local people, under which    
 they have talked, argued and debated  
 for many years. It is also used on    
 Mischief Night (called 'Flitting      
 Night' here,) as a place where        
 children 'flit' every moveable object.</content>
