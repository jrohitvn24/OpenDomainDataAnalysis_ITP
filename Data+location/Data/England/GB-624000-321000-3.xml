		<title>03LAMMAS, with LT. HAUTBOIS</title>
		<content> In local government terms Lammas and  
 Buxton are no different as both have  
 the same{Parish Council.}However      
 geographically and ecclesiasitically  
 they are different.                   
 The River Bure alone separates the two
 parishes. Lammas is much smaller      
 having only about 200 inhabitants. The
 buildings in Lammas are older than    
 those in Buxton. It has only one      
 street which in true Norfolk fashion  
 is called{The Street.}There is an old 
{Manor House}parts of which are        
 Elizabethan. The present{Hall,}now an 
 Old People's Home, is Jacobean in     
 style and certainly dates from that   
 period.                               
 There is only one shop which also     
 serves as a{Post Office.}             
 The authoress{Anna Sewell}of 'Black   
 Beauty' fame is buried in the Old     
 Quaker Burial Ground.                 </content>
