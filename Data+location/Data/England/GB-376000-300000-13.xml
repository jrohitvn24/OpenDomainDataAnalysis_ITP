 The roof was black.The windows were   
 stained glass in the church at        
 Beckbury.                             
                                       
 We have a church to pray in and for   
 the babies to get christened.We have a
 church for Sunday School.

 tell us to help poor people and to    
 tell us to say thank you to people.Mr 
 Dorrington showed us the cassock and  
 the surplice.Mr Dorrington showed us  
 his dog collar and he showed us the   
 stole.                                </content>
