		<title>07An old woman in Killamarsh</title>
		<content> Our O.A.P. lived close to School so we
 walked there with our teacher. She    
 lived in a very pretty and well looked
 after house on a Council Estate. She  
 was a widow and her husband had died a
 year ago. She told us that she had    
 lived in the house since it was built 
 42 years ago. She seemed very proud of
 her house. We asked her if she had    
 many visitors but she said she didn't 
 because people round there weren't in 
 the habit of calling on each other    
 although they would always help each  
 other if there was trouble. She spent 
 most of her spare time knitting for   
 her Grandchildren who live in         
 different parts of the country and she
 visits them quite often. She finds it 
 difficult to manage on her Pension and
 especially thinks that having to pay a
 full Television Licence, when some    
 O.A.P's don't, is very unfair.        </content>
