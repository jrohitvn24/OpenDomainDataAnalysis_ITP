		<content> Buxton has ten general medical        
 practitioners and three hospitals.    
 Corbar Hospital specialises in        
 maternity care, The Royal Devonshire  
 Hospital deals with orthopaedic cases,
 a logical development of a Buxton     
 tradition, and the Cottage Hospital   
 deals with those general medical cases
 which are not of a complex or urgent  
 nature. The nearest Casualty Unit is  
 at Stockport Infirmary, and many other
 Buxton cases are dealt with at the    
 Stepping Hill group of hospitals,     
 Stockport. Stockport is nearly twenty 
 miles away, and many people are       
 concerned with the continuing threats 
 to cloes Corbar Hall Maternity Unit   
 and transfer all its facilities to    
 Stockport. They point out the long and
 hazardous road journey from Buxton to 
 Stockport, especially during the      
 winter.                               </content>
