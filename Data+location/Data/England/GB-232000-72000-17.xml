		<title>17FARMING-AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE</title>
		<content> The largest acreage in this part of E.
 Cornwall is held,under tennancy from  
 the Duchy of Cornwall,by Cornwall     
 County Council as an Agricultural     
 College.This was formed in September  
 1984 having been farmed until then by 
 Duchy Home Farm.Of 45o acres, about   
 12o acres of grass are intensively    
 cultivated for silage and 16 acres cut
 as hay.6o acres are under grain.1o    
 acres grow main crop potatoes. The    
 remainder is pasture.No milk quota was
 available,and a herd of 8o cows is    
 milked at Westcoobeshead in a modern  
 12/12 herringbone unit.A flock of 45o 
 sheep is grazed.Bullocks are kept in  
 the traditional way of part grazing,  
 part yarding.but an innovation is the 
 establishment of a shed where animals 
 are housed from 6 weeks old until     
 marketting at 2 years old.The acreage 
 shown is not all in the survey area.  </content>
