		<title>11CORSTON WEST OF BATH</title>
		<content>{Corston}is a small village to the West
 of Bath. All Saints Church is a big   
{church}and is still used regularly for
 services, weddings, christenings and  
 funerals. The{school,}which was opened
 in 1884, was closed in 1984 as the    
 number of children attending had      
 dropped to 25 making it uneconomical  
 to run. The village{shop}and the{Post 
{Office}are next to each other and are 
 the only shops in the village.The     
{village hall}is used for all different
 kinds of social activities. St.       
 Theresa's{Nursing Home}is where       
{elderly people}are cared for. There is
 a run_down{recreation ground}with only
 two swings and a slide_this is also   
 used by the village football team.    
 Corston is the home of a very well    
 known{television personality}and the  
 village people are very proud of this.
