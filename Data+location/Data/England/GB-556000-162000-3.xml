		<title>03Brands Hatch and noise</title>
		<content> The village of{West Kingsdown}lies    
 immediately to the south of Brands    
 Hatch.  The gardens of some houses    
 go right to the edge of the longer,   
 Grand Prix, circuit.                  
                                       
 Despite the fact that most of the     
 houses were built after the racing    
 circuit there is considerable{local   
{opposition}to racing at Brands Hatch. 
                                       
 The chief causes of concern are{noise 
 and{traffic.} The noise problem is not
 helped by the local topography which  
 serves to funnel the sound in the     
 direction of the local communities.   
                                       
 Race days are mainly at weekends and  
 the{local authority}have fixed a{usage
{constraint}that racing must cease by 8
 p.m. and no activity is allowed before
 9 a.m. on any day.                    </content>
