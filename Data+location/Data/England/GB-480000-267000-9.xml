		<content>The youngest children start school at 4
years old. At 11 they transfer to      
Moulton Comprehensive School. They     
travel there by bus. The children wear 
a school uniform- grey skirts or       
trousers, grey or white shirts, bottle 
green jumpers and a yellow and green   
striped tie. In summer, the girls wear 
a green and white striped dress and the
boys wear a yellow tee-shirt. The      
school is divided into 3 classes- 1    
infant (4-7yrs) and 2 juniors (7-9,    
9-11). There are 3 teachers. There is a
secretary/ancillary helper. On Friday  
mornings the children go by coach to   
Wellingborough swimming baths. The     
school attends Church on Friday        
mornings during Lent, on Sunday at     
Harvest Festival, and at Christmas. The
caretaker looks after the school and   
keeps it clean. After school we have   
netball, football and gym clubs.       </content>
