		<content>{C}hurchill Playing Fields is a large  
open space. There is a big field in    
which you can play football or some    
other sport. It has also got a running 
track. There is a park as well. In the 
park there are swings,slides,climbing  
frames,stepping stones and tunnels.    
A lot of people go there mostly        
children. On a Sunday when it is not   
raining,a lot of people go there.      
People go there when they are taking   
a dog for a walk,because the dog can   
run around the field. Just recently    
there has been a tractor built for the 
younger ones to play on. It is a       
climbing frame with a slide.
