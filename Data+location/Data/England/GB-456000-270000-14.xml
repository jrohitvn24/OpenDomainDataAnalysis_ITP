		<content>  The Parochial Charity is divided up  
 into 5 different charities. They are  
 the Beef Charity of Richard Drayson   
 1806,the charity of John Bucknill     
 1622,the Benjamin Cerr charity 1872,  
 the poor lands charity 1776 and the   
 charity of Sarah Ann Robinson 1874.   
 All of these are based on money that  
 was left.From the money that was left 
 they put some in the bank and bought  
 land with the rest. The income from   
 the land and interest from the bank   
 goes to the needy people of the       
 village.                              
{The Ashby Trust}is based on money that
 a Police Sergeant left.It was put into
 the bank and now gains interest twice 
 a year.This goes to the trustees one  
 of which is the Headteacher in Crick  
 School. This money pays for the food  
 and entertainment of the school's     
 Christmas parties.                    </content>
