		<content> inspectors come round to inspect the  
 fields. Their winter wheat is exported
 as food.                              
       On the farm they have two boar. 
 Fifty sows run onto cutters, this     
 means that they are 180 pounds in     
 weight. 500 pigs on average house,    
 that means that they have enough room 
 for 500 pigs. 30 acres is for the     
 sheep to graze on. They have 350 acres
 of winter wheat, 50 acres of potatoes,
 20 acres of sugarbeet, 62 acres of    
 peas, 34 acres of winter barley, 82   
 acres of spring barley and 100 acres  
 of grass seed. On the farm they plan  
 four years ahead. The planning is very
 complicated. If they get grass seed a 
 field within each each other,the bees 
 will cross_pollinate the grass seed   
 and they will not get the true        
 variety.
