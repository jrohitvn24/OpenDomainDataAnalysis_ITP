		<title>13LANDSCAPE:ASHLEWORTH</title>
		<content> Ashleworth presents an attractive     
 riverside {Landscape.}Lush meadows    
 adjoin the {River Severn }with the    
 first settled buildings clustered at  
 the ancient ferry point:the Church,   
 Court,Tithe Barn and Elizabethan Manor
 House.The ground rises gently towards 
 the old village centred around the    
{Village Green }and then towards the   
 hundred foot contour,where the Post   
 Office is,another focal point of old  
 and new buildings.The road to Hasfield
 runs by Ashleworth Ham,a wetland area 
 and{Nature Reserve.}Hasfield is a     
 pretty hamlet which almost seems to   
 have been preserved in a time         
 capsule,with a picturesque Church,    
 Georgian Old Rectory,Victorian Mansion
 and the interesting Great House.Both  
 villages continue to slope upwards    
 towards their north and west          
 boundaries.                           </content>
