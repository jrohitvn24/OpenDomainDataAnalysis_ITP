		<content> On 23rd October the people of Kineton 
 would not be surprised to meet the    
 ghost of Prince Rupert on his white   
 horse.  The nearest Sunday to the     
 anniversary of the{Battle of Edge Hill
 is today marked by a parade of the    
 regiments of the Sealed Knot Society  
 at the monument alongside the road to 
 Edge Hill.                            
   Present day members of the armed    
 forces lead Kineton's{Remembrance}of  
 the fallen in wars around the Village 
 War Memorial in November.  Poppy      
 Wreaths are laid by representatives   
 of various organisations and this     
 ceremony is followed by a united      
 Service in St Peter's Church.         
   Just prior to Christmas Kinetonians 
 gather in the Market Square to sing   
{carols}led by a choir standing on a   
 farm cart.  Roast Chestnuts, mince    
 pies, soup and coffee are sold.       </content>
