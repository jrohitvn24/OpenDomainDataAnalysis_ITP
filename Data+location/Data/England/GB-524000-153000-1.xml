		<title>01Introduction: Kingswood area</title>
		<content>    The area is a predominantly{rural  
 one.{Housing}is concentrated in the   
 west side of the block in{Lower       
{Kingswood}and{Kingswood.              
{  }The area could not stand as a self 
 sufficient one since it is necessary  
 to travel out of it for farely basic, 
 every day requirements. The few       
 shops, petrol stations and similar    
 amenities there are, can be found in  
 Lower Kingswood (south western most   
 square). The residential area of      
 Kingswood Warren (nw corner) contains 
 many well-to-do, expensive properties.
   {Farmland}occupies all most all of  
 the remaining area, and farming is    
 certainly the main{employment}concern 
 in the area. Much land is given over  
 to grass and to grazing for cattle and
 horses. The only other main employer  
 is a publishing works at Kingswood.
