 The centre was built in two parts. The
 main hall and squash courts were      
 finished in 1972. The two swimming    
 pools were ready in 1975.             
                                       
   The sports facilities currently     
 available include squash, weight and  
 fitness room, table tennis,           
 popmobility, circuit training,        
 netball, indoor bowls and karate.     
                                       
   The main hall is also used for      
 social functions such as discotheques,
 wedding receptions, dog shows, bingo, 
 and public meetings.                  
                                       
   A creche is planned, so too is a new
 health room with sunbeds.
