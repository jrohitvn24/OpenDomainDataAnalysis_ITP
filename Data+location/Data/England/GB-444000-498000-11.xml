 G.R.455002 since 1958.The Bell family 
 owns 3000 acres of land in the area   
 including 4 farms which are part of   
 the estate.She and her sons run the   
 estate and organize their farm        
 managers and farm workers.Beef        
 cattle,sheep,pigs and goats are kept  
 as well as arable crops being grown.  
 Arncliffe Hall itself was built       
 in 1754 and was owned by the          
 Mauleverer family.It was passed onto  
 the Brown family and the Bell family  
 bought the Hall and estate at the     
 beginning of the century.The Hall is  
 renowned for its beautiful ceilings,  
 one of which depicts nearby Roseberry 
 Topping.The house has three floors    
 plus a cellar.Outside there is a      
 decorative moat which has recently    
 been restored and cleared.
