		<title>17A fire at Perse School</title>
		<content>       FRIDAY JULY 5th 1985            
 Mystery blaze at the Perse School for 
 Girls,Union Road,Cambridge.           
   The fire broke out at approximately 
 4am this morning causing extensive    
 damage. Two laboratories were gutted  
 and the rest of the building was      
 severely smoke damaged. Firemen were  
 called from the surrounding areas to  
 help fight the massive fire. Tiles had
 to be taken off the roof to let the   
 smoke escape. Altogether seven fire-  
 engines and thirty firemen were in    
 attendance to bring the fire under    
 control. No-one was in the building at
 the time and police searching for the 
 cause of the fire would like to hear  
 from anyone who saw anything          
 suspicious near the school last night.
   The school is closed today but the  
 headmistress,Miss Bateman,said lessons
 would continue normally next week.    </content>
