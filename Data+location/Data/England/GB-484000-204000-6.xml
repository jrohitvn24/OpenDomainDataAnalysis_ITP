 The farms in the area have a variety  
 of livestock. Milk production is much 
 the fore. There are two large pedigree
 Friesian herds at Little London Farm  
 and Wendover Dene Farm, while the     
 Jersey herd at Grove Farm is          
 internationaly known and acclaimed.   
 This farm also has a herd of Limosan  
 cattle. Beef cattle are also a feature
 of the district, and the parkland at  
 Chequers Court has a herd of suckling 
 beef. Sheep, while not so plentiful,  
 are reared on several farms. A tenant 
 of the beautiful Tudor Small Dene Farm
 has a herd of the rare breed Soary    
 Sheep. Horses are of course a great   
 part of the Chiltern landscape and    
 besides the riding establishments many
 farms have grazing land for these     
 animals.
