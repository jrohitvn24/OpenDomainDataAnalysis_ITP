{Unemployment}in the Newton Abbot area 
 does not seem to be a great problem   
 with the unemployment rate about      
 average. Most people work for{small   
{firms}and many have to travel outside 
 the area to larger communities. Most  
 people work for{service industries    
 rather than heavy manufacturing       
 companies. During the summer months   
 there are more opportunities for jobs 
 because of the{tourists}that come in  
 to the area and make for jobs in      
 hotels, holiday camps etc. When a firm
 closes it does cause a great shock,   
 but most people seem to find other    
 jobs fairly  quickly. One problem     
 people were concerned about was the   
 fact that many{young people}had to    
 move away to find a suitable job.
