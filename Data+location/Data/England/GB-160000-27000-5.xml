		<title>05POPULATION OF ASHTON</title>
		<content> Approximately sixty-five years ago the
 village of Ashton was well populated  
 and contained far more people than it 
 does at present. All the children in  
 the village were sent to Breage School
 in the neighbouring village of Breage 
 which lies less than one mile to the  
 east of Ashton. In those days the     
 local school had over 144 pupils on   
 the school roll. Today the school has 
 14 pupils.                            
                                       
       The total decline of tin mining 
 and quarrying of china clay saw the   
 main economic activity, apart from    
 farming, disappear. This meant that a 
 large part of the population migrated 
 in search of work. Only three people  
 today were born in the village of     
 Ashton.
