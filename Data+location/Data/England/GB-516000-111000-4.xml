		<title>04Steyning's Strange Stories</title>
		<content>  There are several strange stories    
 about Steyning.                       
   In the church porch there is a pagan
 stone which was supposed to be magic  
 and people wouldn't touch  it. When   
 Cuthman came to town he picked up the 
 stone and put it down again. When     
 nothing happened people thought he was
 magical so took notice of him.        
   Cuthman's 2 oxen had been stolen by 
 Fippa's two sons.So Cuthman yoked her 
 two sons together and when Fippa tried
 to put a curse on Cuthman she was     
 drawn up into the air and dropped into
 a muddy pool.                         
   Another supernatural story is that  
 over by Chanctonbury ring a saxon man 
 buried his treasure and after he died 
 at Hastings his ghost was seen by the 
 ring digging with a spade.The treasure
 was found by someone and the ghost    
 hasn't been seen since.               </content>
