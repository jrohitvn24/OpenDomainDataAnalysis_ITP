		<title>18POLITICS IN HEADCORN</title>
		<content> The S.E. part of the area is the most 
 densely poulated and lies entirely    
 within the Parish of Headcorn. 13     
 members are elected to the{Parish     
{Council}to serve for 4 years. These   
 elections are carried out on a semi   
 perty political basis. The whole area 
 lies within the{Borough of Maidstone  
 and so elects Borough Councillors. At 
 present Headcorn Ward returns 1       
 Liberal and 1 Conservative member.    
 Staplehurst Ward in which the S.W.    
 part lies returns 2 Coservative       
 members and the N. part (Sutton       
 Valence Ward) returns 1 Conservative. 
 The{Kent County Councillor}for the    
 area lives in Headcorn (Mr.S.Burden   
 Cons.). The local{M.P.}is Sir John    
 Wells (Cons.). Our{M.E.P.}Mr.Jackson  
 is also Conservative. The{trend}over  
 the last few years seems to have been 
 for an upsurge of Liberal activity.   </content>
