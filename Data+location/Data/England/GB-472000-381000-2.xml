		<title>02ST.JOHN THE BAPTIST'S CHURCH</title>
		<content>  St John the Baptist's church was     
 founded in 1258.Probably there was an 
 earlier church on the same site.There 
 are three bells  in the tower.One is  
 inscribed "SANCTE GABRIEL ORA PRO     
 NOBIS"(St. Gabriel pray for us.)The   
 second bell was made in 1822.The      
 largest bell is marked "JESUS BE OUR  
 SPED"(Speed).This bell is probably    
 dated between 1539 and 1589.The       
 smallest bell is one of the oldest in 
 Great Britain,there are only three    
 bells like it,one in Scotland one in  
 Lincolnshire and one in{Clarborough}. 
 The parish registers go back to       
 1567.The church can accommodate 400   
 people.The churchyard has been used   
 for hundreds of years.                
 The yew tree in the churchyard is     
 believed to be over 1000 years old.   
 There are gargoyles on the walls and  
 the tower.                            </content>
