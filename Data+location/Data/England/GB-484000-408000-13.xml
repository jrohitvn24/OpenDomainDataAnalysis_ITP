		<title>13Burringham School.</title>
		<content> Burringham school has been open for   
 114 years.                            
 There are four classrooms.            
 Most of the classrooms are very small.
 The way it was built was very strange 
 because half was made of brick and the
 other half was made of limestone.     
 The limestone had very interesting    
 fossils in it.                        
 The school field is just an ordinary  
 field with an oak tree in it.         
 The school was extended in 1971 which 
 made more room for classrooms.        
 The field is 60 metres long.          
 The children have to go through the   
 car park to get to the pavement.      
 Also there is no barrier to stop them 
 running on to the road.
