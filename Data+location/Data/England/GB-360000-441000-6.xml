    The Village of Chipping is now     
 becoming a centre of Tourism, due to  
 the exceptional beauty of the         
 countryside throughout the whole area,
 and Tourism is now being encouraged by
 the Ribble Valley Borough Council in  
 association with the North West       
 Tourist Board.                        
                                       
 In the summertime hundreds of people  
 visit the Village, especially on      
 Sundays, most of them coming by car   
 and bicycle, as there are only three  
 buses into the Village on Sundays, and
 some of the local traders are busy    
 catering for their needs. This summer 
 trade provides part-time employment   </content>
