		<content>   Throughout the block the older      
 houses are built of stone, often with 
 slate roofs. In the Drybrook area the 
 Forest stone is used, and in          
 Mitcheldean the Old Red Sandstone as  
 well. Here many houses are covered in 
 painted stucco, and there are one or  
 two timber frame ones. There has been 
 some new building in Drybrook, but in 
 Mitcheldean two private estates have  
 been built in recent years. The       
 largest, Carisbrooke Gardens dates    
 from the late 1960's - early 1970's,  
 and the Baynham Road area from the    
 middle 1970's. Most of these modern   
 dwellings are of brick and tile       
 construction. There are some          
 bungalows, but a typical modern home  
 in Mitcheldean would be a small       
 semi-detached or detached house with  
 garage or car port and gardens front  
 and rear.                             </content>
