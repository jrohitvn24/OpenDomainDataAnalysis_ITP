		<title>10THE VICAR'S TYPICAL DAY</title>
		<content> The Vicar of Walesby is also the Vicar
 of Egmanton and Rector of Kirton.     
 Although no day is the same as another
 these are a few activities that he may
 engage in. He will rise at 6:45 and be
 in Egmanton church at 7:30 for a mass 
 at 8:00. He says daily offers at      
 Walesby church at 9:00 and mass at    
 10:00. After this he may take the sick
 communion set around to the ill in    
 their homes.                          
 After lunch he may have a number of   
 things to do, such as visiting people,
 or on Thursday afternoons he will take
 assembly at Walesby school. At 6:00 he
 will go to church to say prayers and  
 on some evenings he will have a       
 meeting, his day then ending between  
 9:00 and 10:00.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
