		<title>16RELIGION IN STAMBOURNE 1</title>
		<content>  Stambourne's parish church (Church of
 England), St. Peter &amp; St. Thomas, is  
 just outside the area surveyed by this
 group. Stambourne shares a Rector with
 Toppesfield, and a new Rector was     
 appointed in July 1985 after a vacancy
 of 3 years. He lives in Toppesfield.  
 The building, which seats about 200,  
 is almost full for the Harvest        
 Festival and Christmas Carol Services,
 but the regular congregation numbers  
 about 20. One service is held each    
 Sunday. A Sunday School has just been 
 started and numbers 18 children under 
 eleven years of age.                  
  There is also a Congregational chapel
 which belongs to the Congregational   
 Union; churches which preferred to    
 remain independent when the United    
 Reformed Church was set up in the     
 early 1970's.                         
                                       </content>
