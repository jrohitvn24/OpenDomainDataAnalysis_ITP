		<title>07FARMING CROPS AND PRACTICES</title>
		<content>The farms in the area produce mostly   
arable crops including fruit such as:  
cherries, pears, apples and plums.     
Vegetables such as: beans, potatoes,   
peas, carrots, beetroot, cabbages and  
lettuce are also grown. Wheat and      
barley are the most common crops, while
it is not uncommon to see sheep grazing
in the orchards. Thus some land has to 
be used for treated grasses for silage.
The farmers work seven days a week on  
the land, and the hours are long       
especially at harvest, which can last  
up to three months.Each of the farms   
covers about 700 acres of land which   
is separated out for the growing of the
various crops.Land types vary from the 
flat and dry to lush U shaped valleys  
which will support orchards.The farms  
in the area have a great advantage in  
that the M2 motorway provides easy and 
quick access to markets.               </content>
