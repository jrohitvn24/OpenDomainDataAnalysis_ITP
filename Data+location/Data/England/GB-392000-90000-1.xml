		<content> A lot of our area is made up of pine  
 forests and heathland.                
                                       
 There  are a lot of fallow deer  in   
 the forests. It is  mainly  pine  but 
 there  are  a  few  decidous  trees   
 around  the  outside  of  the forest. 
                                       
 On the heath there are a lot of adders
 and grass snakes.There is clay under  
 the heathland and there are lots of   
 ponds which are dug to find clay for a
 pottery.                              
                                       
 There is an{Admiralty Research        
{Establishment}in our  area and  many  
 people from Holton  Heath are employed
 there.                                
                                       
 We  have an {industrial estate}and    
 lots  of people work there.
