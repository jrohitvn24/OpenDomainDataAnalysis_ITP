		<title>15OVER SIXTIES WEDNESDAY CLUB</title>
		<content> I am a Senior Citizen living in       
 Chaddesley Corbett, which is a very   
 friendly village. We have a Wednesday 
 club which is run by the W.V.S.       
 We have two meetings a month except   
 August, we are taken by our voluntary 
 drivers and brought home again.       
 There are lots of interesting speakers
 on a variety of subjects, then we     
 finish with tea and a raffle.         
 The Club Birthday is remembered with a
 Special Tea and has been going for    
 many years.                           
 Christmas is celebrated with a party  
 and entertainment.                    
 Through the summer months we have many
 trips to the coast and country houses 
 by coach which is all arranged for us.
 The club members take part in many    
 events which are held in the village  
 throughout the year.
