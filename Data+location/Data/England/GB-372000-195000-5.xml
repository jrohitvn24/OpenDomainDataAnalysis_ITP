		<title>05Local History in Nibley</title>
		<content> At Nibley Green in 1471 the last      
 private battle in England was fought. 
 It was between William Berkeley and   
 Lord Lisle of Wotton, to settle the   
 family feud as to who was the rightful
 heir to the Berkeley estate. Both men 
 had armies of about 500 men and the   
 battle was won by the Berkeleys, after
 Lord Lisle was shot in the eye. The   
 Berkeley family owned the Nibley area 
 from 1126-1920. They then were forced 
 to sell it to pay off their debts. In 
 1845 the remains of a Roman villa were
 discovered in the grounds of Stancombe
 Park, by the man who lived there, Mr. 
 Purnell. Following excavations, the   
 finds were sent to Gloucester Museum. 
 Unfortunately all the evidence of the 
 villa was lost. Farming and to a      
 lesser extentthe woollen industry have
 been the main influences in the area.
