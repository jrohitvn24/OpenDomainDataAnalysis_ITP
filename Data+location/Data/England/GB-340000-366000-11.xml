		<content> AROUND OUR AREA THERE ARE MANY WEEDS. 
 JUST OUTSIDE OUR CLASSROOM DOOR WE    
 FOUND A MAYWEED,GROUNDSEL AND A DOCK. 
 THE MAYWEED LOOKS LIKE A DAISY BUT HAS
 FUNNY SHAPED LEAVES.IT IS SMALLER THAN
 THE DAISY AND HAS A YELLOW MIDDLE AND 
 WHITE PETALS. THE GROUNDSEL IS LONG   
 AND THIN IT HAS LITTLE GREEN BUDS     
 COMING OUT OF THE SIDE WITH YELLOW    
 TIPS. THE DOCK IS A STALK WITH  LOTS  
 OF LITTLE SEEDS STICKING OUT OF THE   
 SIDE. THE LEAF OF THE DOCK IS VERY    
 GOOD FOR NETTLE STINGS.IT IS VERY SOFT
 AND FURRY. ANOTHER TYPE OF LEAF IS A  
 CLOVER AND THERE IS A SAYING THAT SAYS
 IF YOU FIND A FOUR LEAF CLOVER YOU CAN
 HAVE A WISH THAT WILL COME TRUE.      
 ANOTHER WEED IS A BUTTERCUP WHICH HAS 
 A THIN STEM AND YELLOW PETALS.
