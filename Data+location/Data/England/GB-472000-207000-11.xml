		<content> An Interview.                         
 What is a{ceilidh?}This is a{folk     
{dance,}for anyone to come and join in.
 There will be{folk dancing, singing   
 and{display teams.                    
 What gave you the idea? For a long    
 time I ran a folk song club in Harrow,
 and when I moved to Haddenham I felt  
 it would be a good idea to run a      
{monthly ceilidh}in the{large village  
{hall.                                 
 When did they start? The first ceilidh
 was on the first Saturday in{December,
{1972                                  
 How many people go? We have about{250 
 who come every month.                 
 Have you ever planned to hold a       
 festival like they have a Towersey?   
 No, I have no plans for a large       
 festival. We have a{full day ceilidh  
 in{December}which is a big event,{full
{of music and dance.                   </content>
