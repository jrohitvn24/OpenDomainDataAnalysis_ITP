   The old stone houses are mainly at  
the centre of the village and a few are
still thatched. There is quite a lot of
what was originally council housing on 
the north and west sides of the village
although some of it has now been sold  
to and improved by the tenants.        
                                       
   The majority of homes are owner     
occupied and the village has been      
added to over the last thirty years by 
the building of small estates and      
individual houses. In the small        
development at the southern edge of    
the village, recently built, the       
houses cost 55 000 pounds.             
                                       
    Most of the houses have gardens    
and the bungalows have generally had   
rooms put in their roofs.
