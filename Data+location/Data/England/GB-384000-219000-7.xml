		<title>07MAYOR OF TEWKESBURY BOROUGH</title>
		<content> MRS. ROBERTS WAS MAYOR OF TEWKESBURY  
 BOROUGH DURING 1984-85 (CHURCHDOWN IS 
 IN TEWKESBURY BOROUGH). SHE ATTENDED  
 170 COMMITTEE MEETINGS AND CHAIRED    
 MANY OF THEM. YOU HAVE TO BE DEPUTY   
 MAYOR BEFORE YOU BECOME MAYOR. THE    
 MAYOR IS ALWAYS ADDRESSED AS 'MR.     
 MAYOR' EVEN IF A WOMAN HOLDS THE      
 OFFICE. YOU CANNOT LOSE YOUR SEAT     
 UNLESS YOU DIE OR COMMIT A CRIMINAL   
 OFFENCE. BEING A MAYOR IS VOLUNTARY   
 WORK. THE HOURS THAT MRS. ROBERTS     
 WORKED WERE 7.30 A.M. UNTIL 2.00 A.M. 
   SHE NEVER LOST ANY FRIENDS BUT HAD  
 MANY THREATENING TELEPHONE CALLS.     
 DISADVANTAGES WERE USING HER OWN CAR, 
 HAVING TO PAY FOR ALL THE PETROL AND  
 MISSING OUT ON FAMILY LIFE.           
   MRS. ROBERTS IS STILL AN ELECTED    
 COUNCILLOR FOR CHURCHDOWN PARISH, BUT 
 DOES NOT WANT TO BE MAYOR AGAIN.
