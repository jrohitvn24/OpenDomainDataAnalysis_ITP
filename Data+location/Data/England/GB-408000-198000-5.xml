		<content>  We sent out a questionnaire about    
 life in the area and had about 200    
 replies, not all of them complete.    
  100 houses were built before 1970,   
 half of them before 1900. 30 houses   
 (including mobile homes) were built in
 the last 10 years and 4 were built    
 this year. Because of local quarries, 
 twice as many were built of Cotswold  
 stone than anything else. 90 houses   
 have garage facilities, sometimes in  
 outbuildings. 85 houses have vegetable
 and flower gardens, 60 have just      
 flower gardens and 1 has just a       
 vegetable patch. 1 has no garden at   
 all.                                  
  An equal number of dwellings use logs
 and electricity for heating. Oil is   
 used by the least number (40) and the 
 most used fuel is coal. There is no   
 gas available in the area. 116 homes  
 are owner occupied and 23 are rented. </content>
