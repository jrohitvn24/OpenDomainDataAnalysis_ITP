		<title>17DOULTING STONE.(ONE)</title>
		<content>{Doulting Stone}has been quarried in   
 and around{Doulting}since at least    
 709 A.D. We know this because the     
 monks who built and owned{Glastonbury 
{Abbey}allowed some people to dig some 
 Doulting Stone to re-build the wooden 
 church in Doulting after{St. Aldhelm  
 had died there. There have been a lot 
 of{quarries}around{Doulting}and those 
 which were a long way from the railway
 line had a tramway connecting them to 
 a mason's shed next to the{Great      
{Western Railway}near Merrifield Lane. 
 The tramway which connected the       
 quarries in{Doulting}and{Chelynch}was 
 taken up when the{Bath and Portland   
{Stone Company}bought them. The lines  
 are still underneath the Frome to     
 Shepton Mallet road. Nowadays lorries 
 are used to take the stone away to be 
 used in building.
