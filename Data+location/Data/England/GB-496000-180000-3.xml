		<title>03THE CATTLE MARKET AT SLOUGH</title>
		<content>     We went to the Cattle Market on   
 Tuesday, which was auction day, so it 
 was packed with buyers and sellers.   
 The animals came from nearby farms and
 the customers came from a 15 mile     
 radius. What people looked for in an  
 animal was health, strength and       
 quality, and the animal must match the
 purpose the buyer requires.           
     There were bulls, cows, calves,   
 pigs and piglets for sale.   When we  
 came the calves were up for auction.  
 The pigs were usually sold and        
 slaughtered for meat.  Apart from farm
 animals, rabbits, ducks, geese, hens  
 and chickens were sold.  Farm         
 equipment was also being sold.        
     The cows and other animals were   
 waiting in pens.  There was a nasty   
 smell.  The pens which the animals    
 were in, were dirty and wet.
