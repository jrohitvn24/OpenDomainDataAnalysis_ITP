		<title>19Feed Merchants-Hade Edge</title>
		<content> Most farmers buy their feeding        
 supplies from feed merchants. These   
 merchants can be found in any country 
 area and sometimes in towns.Some of   
 these merchants buy the{grain}from    
 farmers and they mix several varieties
 together to make a complete food for  
 farm animals.Vitamins are also added  
 to make a better feed.Other merchants 
 buy their supplies from large mills   
 and deliver it to farms as the farmer 
 requires.A firm like this can be found
 at{Hade Edge.}They buy wheat,barley,  
 oats,etc.from suppliers in the North  
 and East Ridings of Yorkshire.All     
 these supplies are delivered by road  
 transport to store at Hade Edge.      
 Someone from the store goes around the
 local farms to take orders from the   
 farmers and this is delivered by wagon
 to the farms when the farmer needs it.
