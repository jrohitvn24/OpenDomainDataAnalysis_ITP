		<title>02The Bishop of Peterborough</title>
		<content>  I write this from one of the few     
 houses in England called a Palace,    
 where my predecessors, the Abbots and 
 Bishops of Peterborough, have lived in
 unbroken line from before the first   
 Domesday Book. Parts of my home were  
 built in the year 1200 and every      
 century since has brought something   
 new. Living here is like living inside
 history. The new communities built    
 around this ancient centre are in a   
 long tradition of building and renewal
 which has characterised this city, and
 the giant Cathedral, our neighbour, is
 in a similar tradition, that of an    
 ever-renewing faith, which has been   
 here for 1300 years and which still   
 has significance in the lives of many.
 If there is anyone reading this _ for 
 we are pessimists in the 1980s _ well,
 I wish you a history and a faith for  
 your time.        {+ William Petriburg</content>
