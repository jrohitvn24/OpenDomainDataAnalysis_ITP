		<title>14FARMING</title>
		<content>     Besides the main task of milking  
 twice a day there are many other jobs 
 that need attending to by the farmer. 
 In the Sandbach area most farms employ
 only one skilled farm worker.         
     During the winter months when the 
 herd is kept indoors the cleaning  and
 feeding is a further time consuming   
 excercise.In summer this is less of a 
 problem because the cattle can be     
 turned out to graze.                  
     During the summer the most busy   
 time for the farmer is when he is     
 involved in the cutting of grass for  
 silage.Between May and September there
 will be three cuts which will         
 hopefully provide enough silage for   
 the winter months.                    
     Other jobs include the growing of 
 potatoes,small amounts of cereals and 
 other fodder crops and the grazing of 
 store lambs during the winter months. </content>
