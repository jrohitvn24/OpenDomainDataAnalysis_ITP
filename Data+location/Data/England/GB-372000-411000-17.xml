		<content> The air freshness of the area is quite
 good because of its elevated position 
 and the hills around.However on the   
 main roads fumes and noise from cars  
 make the area less attractive.The road
 safety is poor as the roads are busy  
 and often have parked cars.The roads  
 contain a lot of litter and some road 
 signs are covered with graffiti.The   
 pavements are poor,often broken and   
 uneven,because they are old and badly 
 maintained and because tree roots have
 pushed some of them up.               
 Some of the council estates have a run
 down appearance but most of the modern
 housing estates are attractive and    
 well maintained.Their main problem is 
 inadequate street lighting.           
 Generally the area is attractive with 
 modern housing and green open space.
