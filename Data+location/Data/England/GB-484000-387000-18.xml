		<title>18Springthorpe Church. Inside.</title>
		<content>{The Church of St. George and Lawrence.
                                       
  Just inside the door of the church   
 there is a Norman font with a cover on
 it. This is used for christenings.    
 Next to the font there is a glass case
 with a paper garland in it. This was  
 made to remember a girl who died when 
 she was ringing the church bell on    
 Shrove Tuesday 1814.                  
  If you turn round and face the alter 
 on your right you will see the south  
 aisle and the vestry which were added 
 later and are not part of the original
 church.
