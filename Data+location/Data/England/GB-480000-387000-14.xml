		<title>14TRAFFIC SURVEY</title>
		<content> To find out about the cars in our area
 we made a survey of cars that were    
 parked or travelling during one       
 afternoon.Nearly one car in every     
 three that we saw was made by ford.The
 Escort was the most popular car.The   
 second most popular was the Vauxhall  
 Cavalier.We had expcted to see many   
 Datsuns but did not.We saw seven      
 taxis.Although we were looking at cars
 we were surprised by the high number  
 of lorries and vans that were using   
 roads,almost as many as cars.About a  
 quarter of the cars we saw were less  
 than two years old.One car in every   
 six was more than ten years old,and   
 the oldest was E registerd,about      
 eighteen years old.Most cars were     
 travelling too fast.
