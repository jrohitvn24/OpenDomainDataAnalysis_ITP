 coming mainly from Bangladesh,Pakistan
 and India. In Nuneaton there are 2400 
 muslims,250 hindus and 150 sikhs. In  
 our area there are over 50 muslims,15 
 hindus and 23 sikh individuals.There  
 is no mosque in our area but there is 
 a large one at Frank Street which cost
 Â£750,000 and is also used as a        
 religious and community centre. The   
 old mosque was in Edward Street and   
 was just two houses. This was used    
 until 1984. Prayers are held five     
 times a day, seven days a week at the 
 mosque. On Friday a special           
 congregational prayer is performed. In
 the evening 450 children attend       
 religious instruction and study       
 classes. The first known muslims in   
 Nuneaton came in 1955.The sikhs do not
 have a temple in Nuneaton. The hindus 
 are hoping to open a temple soon.     </content>
