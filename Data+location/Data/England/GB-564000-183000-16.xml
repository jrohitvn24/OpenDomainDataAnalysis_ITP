		<title>16The Flower Festival-Horndon</title>
		<content> The Flower Festival in the Parish     
 Church is an important, beautiful and 
 colourful activity which takes place  
 during the annual Feast and Fayre.    
 The original charter stated that the  
 Feast and Fayre should be connected   
 with the Patron Saints of the Church. 
 Each year Margaret Leigh and her team 
 of flower arrangers work vey hard to  
 get the display ready.  They show a   
 different theme each year.  This year 
 they have chosen Fact or Fiction, and 
 the various flower arrangements show  
 different stories from the Old        
 Testament.  They attempted to show how
 in some cases history and legend have 
 been combined in the actual writing of
 familiar stories from the Old         
 Testament of the Bible.  Many people  
 listen to the musical items arranged  
 by M. &amp; J. Rawlinson.
