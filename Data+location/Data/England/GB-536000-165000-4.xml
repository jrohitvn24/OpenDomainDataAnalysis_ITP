		<title>04Some Natural Areas-W.Wickham</title>
		<content>   Our area is urban with owner-occu-  
pied family houses. There is much traf-
fic in Pickhurst Lane and Westmoreland 
Road resulting in much pollution. There
are four main conservation areas:Pick- 
hurst Park,which includes a small      
copse;Pickhurst Green with a wood and  
pond;Southill Woods and Pickhurst      
School grounds.Here there is a variety 
of trees and a pond.In all these places
parts have been left wild for animals  
and birds to find homes.

   High Broom Wood is a quiet, relaxing
place.It contains much wildlife. Stick-
leback, together with frogs and toads, 
live in and around the stream which it 
contains.There are many birds and foxes
also. Sadly, we found a felled elm tree
which had been infected with Dutch Elm 
Disease.
