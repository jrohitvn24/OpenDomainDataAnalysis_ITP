		<content> We interviewed a husband and wife     
 who have been living in Arborfield for
 aroud 57 years. The wife came when she
 was 20.She is now 71.                 
 They brought 3 children up in the     
 village.The children now have jobs    
 and don't live in the village.        
 The wife worked in a place called     
 Newlands, that building isn't standing
 anymore.She has a chicken called      
 Junior which lays some eggs but they  
 sell eggs from another man.They grow  
 peas,onions,potatoes and a few other  
 vegetables and they sell some of them.
 Their bungalow is 58 years old, the   
 husband built it himself. His Great   
 Grandma and Grandpa owned Newlands    
 Farm at one time.They say they like   
 the village how it used to be.        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
