		<content> 22nd May {Sylvia Barrett}and myself{  
{Marie Pitt}went out to Newbold, and we
 went to three people's houses, and    
 talked to people we knew. We went and 
 asked them some questions. All of the 
 people had{telephones, gardens and    
{garages.}None had open fires, all of  
 them had semi-detacted houses. All of 
 them had toilets upstairs, all we     
 interviewed lived up{Main Road.}Most  
 of them had 2 or 3 bedrooms, 6 to 10  
 rooms and pattio's at the back. All of
 them had bathrooms upstairs. None of  
 them had cellars, and they all had    
 attics. All the houses were modern.   
 Most of them had a big house.
