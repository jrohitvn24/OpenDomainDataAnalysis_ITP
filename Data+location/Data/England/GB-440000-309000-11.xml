		<title>11IBSTOCK COMMUNITY COLLEGE -1</title>
		<content>   Ibstock High School has been a      
 community college since l963, as a    
 result of the Director of Education's 
 desire to open up the school's        
 facilities to the community at large. 
   It has a large catchment area,      
 drawing people from Measham, Groby,   
 Barlestone and Thringstone.           
   In a year it runs 145 different     
 classes, catering for the educational 
 (e.g.'O' level French) and            
 recreational (e.g. badminton) needs of
 the area.                             
   About 3,200 people use the college  
 facilties each week. This includes    
 classes, affiliated groups and local  
 primary schools.                      
   Around 2,500 of them use the        
 swimming pool which was opened in     
 l976. The local community raised the  
 Â£50,000 cost of the pool.
