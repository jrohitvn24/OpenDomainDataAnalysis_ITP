		<title>09SHOPPING PRECINT</title>
		<content> Waterlooville Shopping Precint,which  
 was formally opened in May 1985,is    
 fairly large and has a variety of     
 shops,although there is not an open   
 market.if there were one,we think even
 more customers would come to the      
 precint.                              
     In our survey we found that there 
 were many food and non-food shops,with
 not so many pubs,snack bars,and       
 take-away hot food shops.There were   
 quite a few restaurants,but no wine   
 bars.The area could do with more      
 garages with services.We counted 12   
 Building Societies Offices and 8      
 Banks.We noticed some DIY Stores and a
 good library,with a bookshop nearby.  
   We think Waterlooville Precinct is  
 well equiped with shops,attractively  
 laid out,and is highly recommended for
 shopping.
