 The hairdressing salon has been       
 established since 1984 and although   
 only open for 3 days,is well used.    
 The village undertaker organises      
 burials and cremations.The Parish     
 Cemetery is next to the Churchyard    
 while cremations are carried out in   
 Plymouth.                             
 Milk is delivered daily by the Hawkin 
 family of Stoke Climsland who have    
 built up a reputation for their       
 reliability.A Co-op milkman also      
 delivers door to door in the village. 
 Down the hill to the east of the      
 village is the local garage at Notter 
 Bridge.This sells petrol,second hand  
 cars and carries out MOT tests and    
 repairs.Also at Notter Bridge is a    
 public house of the same name.Here the
 customer can enjoy refreshment beside 
 the River Lynher.                     </content>
