		<content> At 8 o'clock I get up. I get dressed  
 then have my breakfast at about       
 8.20am. I make my juice for my packed 
 lunch. I then sit around until 9      
 o'clock when I go outside and wait for
 the bus. The bus comes at 9.05. School
 starts at 9.30am. We have a break at  
 10.30 and start work again at 10.50.  
 We have lunch at 12.00. We start work 
 again at 13.00. We have another break 
 at 14.30 and we come in at 14.50. We  
 leave school at 15.30. When I get home
 at 15.45 I have a drink and do my     
 homework. Next I change out of my     
 school uniform and go and watch T.V.  
 until 17.00 when I have my dinner. I  
 have to wash the dishes and then I    
 watch T.V. or I go outside and play   
 until it is time to go to Guides.     
 Guides start at 19.30. We do all sorts
 of things there. I go to bed at about 
 22.10.                                </content>
