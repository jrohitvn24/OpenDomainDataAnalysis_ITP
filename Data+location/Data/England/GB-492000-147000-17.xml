		<title>17SHOPPING IN PUTTENHAM</title>
		<content> Twenty-five years ago there were five 
{shops in Puttenham;}a grocer, a       
 butcher, a baker and a newsagent, as  
 well as a large post office and       
 general store.                        
                                       
 In 1985 there is only one, a small    
 newsagent which is also the Post      
 Office. The nearest{shopping centres  
 are in{Guildford or Godalming,}each of
 which is about five miles away.       
                                       
 Village residents, particularly       
 pensioners without cars, find shopping
 very difficult as there is only one   
 bus a day through the village to      
 Guildford and no public transport to  
 Godalming.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
