		<content>   Scouts is on every Friday night and 
 we go to church every first Sunday in 
 the month or very special occasions   
 like Christmas. Every year we have a  
 "Drink-station" for the runners in the
  Half Marathon. There are 8 camps a   
 year. About 20 of us camp at Hesley or
 Squirrel Wood. The uniform is a green 
 shirt, brown trousers, green beret and
 a purple and white necker.At scouts we
 play games and learn how to do things 
 like tying ropes and skills for       
 badges, first aid etc. Sometimes we   
 go to the woods or on to the field,and
 learn to make bivouacs and so on. Cubs
