		<content> Intensive cultivation with destruction
 or trimming back of hedges had        
 resulted in the decrease of many      
 country birds and animals until the   
 last year or two. A more positive     
 conservation policy seems to be       
 encouraging their resurgence.Coppicing
 of part of Hayton Wood will,it is     
 hoped,bring back the nightingale and  
 woodpecker. Tree planting nearer the  
 Downs has encouraged the return of    
 badgers.Foxes abound,the rabbit also. 
 Traffic on the lanes has,on the other 
 hand,decimated the hedgehog,&amp; in only 
 one small area are glow worms to be   
 found. Elvers have disappeared from   
 the springs. Two large mixed farms    
 sustain large herds,one of pediigree  
 dairy cattle,the other of sheep being 
 bred experimentally as cross between  
 Romneys &amp; the German Oldenburg.
