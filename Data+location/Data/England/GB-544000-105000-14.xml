 In Firle village there is only one    
 means of saving and that is the little
 Post Office which most people use     
 instead of going to the town to the   
 bank.You can draw pensions and buy    
 stamps here as well as getting        
 money.There are no banks or building  
 societies which is difficult for old  
 people.

 There is no gas in Firle because it is
 not joined to the gas mains. Some     
 people have electric cookers and some 
 use solid fuel cookers called         
 Rayburns. Sometimes peoples homes are 
 heated by their Rayburns. Some houses 
 have electric central heating. Some   
 houses have Calor gas heaters.
