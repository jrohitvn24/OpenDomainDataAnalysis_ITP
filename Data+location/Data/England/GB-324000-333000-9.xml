 We have done a  survey of {employment.
 In our area.Very few people are       
 employed in this area.There aren't any
 factories in our area and most people 
  have to go out of our area to work.  
 Farmers are one of the few groups who 
 don't have to go out of our area to   
 work.I have found that in 1 square    
 kilometere of our area grid reference 
 26,33 that 9 people are retired.There 
 are 4 teachers, 2 people that work at 
 British Telecom, 2 lorry drivers, 1   
 publican, 1 civil servant, 1 plasterer
 1 t.v. shop owner, 1 lecturer, 1 coach
 operater, 1 army officer, 1 rector, 1 
 nurse, 1 plumber, 1 joiner,2 builders,
 1 clerk, 1 salesman, and 1 riding     
 stable owner.The square I did my      
 survey in was 26,33 and this is the   
 most densley populated square in our  
 12 sqaure kilometre area.             </content>
