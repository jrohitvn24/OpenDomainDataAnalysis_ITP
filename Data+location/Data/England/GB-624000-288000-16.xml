		<content> Originally small farms,60% of the land
 around Denton is farmed by 2 land_    
 owners.No organic fertilizers are used
 on the large wheat fields(miles of    
{hedges}removed)tractor &amp; aerial       
 spraying is frequently done.There are 
 now(because of milk quotas)only 3     
 dairy herds of cows.The{Footpath}     
 Society formed 2yrs ago,has re_opened 
 some of the footpaths,many remain     
 overgrown.Less cutting of road verges 
 has encouraged resurgence of{wild     
{flowers,}including Early Purple &amp;     
 Spotted Orchids,consequently more     
 moths &amp; butterflies are seen.The water
 ways suffer high nitrate levels;toads,
 frogs,freshwater fish,kingfishers &amp;   
 herons now rarely seen.{Birds of Prey 
 are increasing again due to more      
 selective pesticides &amp; more tolerant  
 gamekeepers;as are rabbits after myx_ 
 amatosis.We have a temperate climate. </content>
