		<content>   Sainsbury's Supermarket is on the   
 ground floor and sells fresh fish,    
 meat, greengroceries and bread as well
 as tinned packaged and frozen foods.  
   The Supermarket was built in 1980.  
 The land was sold to Sainsbury's by   
 Croydon Council on the condition that 
 Sainsbury's provided a swimming pool  
 and a car park.                       
   The average daily takings are       
 Â£75,000-Â£100,000 and the supermarket  
 is open six days a week.              
   The swimming pool is very popular   
 with local residents and cost 55p for 
 children, 95p for adults.             
   It has an eight floor multi-storey  
 car park with an automatic barrier and
 cost 20p for a two hour stay. It has  
 lifts and staircases and disabled     
 people have parking near the lifts.   
   Both the swimming pool and car park 
 are run by Croydon Council.           </content>
