		<content>{There are no public recreational      
{facilities within the block.}The      
 countryside is riddled with footpaths 
 for those who enjoy{walking}&amp; bridle- 
 ways for the many{horse-riders}in the 
 area. Bluehouse Farm offers training  
 facilities for pony &amp; rider &amp; has     
 livery stables. It prides itself on   
 the fact that Diana Clapham, who won a
 silver medal when she rode in the 1984
 Olympics, was trained here. The Rivers
 Whitewater &amp; Hart plus several small  
 ponds provide for the{anglers}whilst  
 the network of country lanes attract  
{cyclists. Hazeley Heath is a Site of  
{Scientific Interest}&amp; consequently    
 attracts bird-watchers, botanists &amp;   
 the like - its sandy tracks are used  
 by budding{motorcyclists &amp; BMX riders.
 Council{allotments}have recently been 
 opened in West Green Road to cater for
 the increasing demand.                </content>
