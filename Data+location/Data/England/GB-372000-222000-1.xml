		<content> DESCRIPTION OF AREA AROUND KENTS GREEN
 The land itself is largely given over 
 to agricultural use, growing crops and
 grazing cattle and a few sheep. There 
 are a few areas of woodland which     
 contain mainly deciduous trees.       
 The area is very rural in appearance  
 with few houses. The land is gently   
 rolling hills not rising to more than 
 100 feet. The roads through the block 
 are country lanes usually only 1 car  
 width. There are some small streams   
 cutting through on their way to join  
 the River Severn.                     
 People either work on the local farms 
 or travel to the surrounding towns.   
 There is no manufacturing Industry.   
 The area is served by a local bus     
 service, The Post Office and British  
 Telecom. Schools are in the local     
 village and towns. A car is almost    
 essential to get around.              </content>
