		<title>14THE FARM LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content>    In the last twenty-five years the  
 changes which have taken place in     
 British Farming have been so rapid and
 so striking that they have been       
 referred to as an "agricultural       
 revolution".There has been a large    
 extension of crop farming; on the     
 heavy clay soils where more powerful  
 machines are able to plough the       
 land. These were originally under     
 permanant grassland.                  
    There has been a tremendous        
 expansion in the use of fertilisers   
 and insecticides. Vast quantities of  
 chemicals are put into the soil to    
 increase yields and keep down         
 weeds. Plants are sprayed from the air
 against diseases. Improved methods of 
 handling and marketing farm produce   
 have been developed. Another trend in 
 marketing is the increased importance 
 of the frozen foods industry.         </content>
