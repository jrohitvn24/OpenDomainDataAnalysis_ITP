		<content>{WHAT THE INHABITANTS THINK.           
{GOOD THINGS                     }     
 Nearly everyone said that Kilmington  
 is a very pretty village which has    
 lovely views around it.   Other       
 aspects which people like are that it 
 is peaceful and quiet, it is clean and
 tidy, the people are friendly and are 
 good neighbours, and it is near to the
 mainline railway station at Axminster.
{BAD THINGS.                        }  
 The things which people do  not like  
 are that there are no buses or public 
 transport serving the village, there  
 are no street lights and that it is   
 too far from good amenities.   Some   
 said that there are too many old      
 people in Kilmington, not enough night
 life, too few teenagers and not enough
 jobs in the area.   A few objected to 
 any new buildings.
