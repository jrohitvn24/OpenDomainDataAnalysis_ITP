		<content> The area of this block is pre-        
 dominantly agricultural.Recently it   
 was noteable for its orchards and     
 fruit production but it is now an area
 of mixed farming.                     
 The soil,being river deposits,is      
 mainly rich but heavy clay.A large    
 range of cereals and vegetables are   
 grown and livestock are kept;beef and 
 milking cattle,sheep and pigs being   
 dominant.                             
 The land undulates gently,nowhere     
 being unavailable for agricultural    
 development.Large areas of woodland   
 are left standing and though some of  
 these are managed for timber many are 
 left for shooting and hunting.        
 Worcester is the dominant urban focus,
 many local people go there shopping,  
 for entertainment and for schools.    
 It is a very quiet rural backwater    
 with a sparse population.             </content>
