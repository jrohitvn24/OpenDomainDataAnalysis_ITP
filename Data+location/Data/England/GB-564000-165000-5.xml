		<title>05TOURISM IN MEOPHAM AREA</title>
		<content> A few tourists come to Meopham, they  
 come from Canada, America,  Japan,    
 Yugoslavia, India, Australia and they 
 sometimes come from Germany. The      
 tourists come to Meopham to see the   
 cricket on the Green, the big Windmill
 and the Cricketers Public House. A    
 long time ago, a man from the         
 Cricketers Public House said,         
 "Whoever puts the ball through the    
 Cricketers window will get            
 Â£5O."Someone did it about six years   
 ago.  His name was Brian Sambrook, and
 it happened in l979. Outside the      
 Cricketers Public House is a flag with
 the initials M.C.C. _ Meopham Cricket 
 Club. The tourists like the Cricketers
 because it is like an old typical     
 English pub and it is by the Green.The
 tourists like to take photographs of  
 the flag because the initials M.C.C.  
 are very famous.                      </content>
