		<title>14 PUBLIC TRANSPORT DECLINE</title>
		<content>The survey emphasises the problems     
connected with the decline in public   
transport.72% of those asked owned cars
&amp; 76% said that car ownership was      
essential.87% found the bus-fares too  
high &amp; most complained about the cuts  
in &amp; infrequency of public transport.  
These are typical rural problems which 
affect old people most.The closure of  
the railway,under Beeching in 1967,was 
a blow to the area.This branch line    
linked the Otter valley to the Southern
Region main line &amp; London.It was opened
in 1897 &amp; ran up the west bank of the  
Otter;E.Budleigh Stn was across from   
Otterton.Now only a trackless embank-  
ment remains &amp; the station is a house. 
The loss is the greater as the bus     
service has not been increased to      
compensate.Local children are bussed   
to Exmouth Community College &amp; may face
journeys of up to 45 minutes.          </content>
