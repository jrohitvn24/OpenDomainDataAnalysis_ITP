		<title>06COASTAL EROSION AT GURNARD</title>
		<content> The Isle of Wight is suffering from   
 coastal erosion.The cliffs are going  
 into the sea because the waves are    
 washing them away. The land at the    
 bottom of the gardens in Solent View  
 road is slipping into the sea. The    
 landslips are caused by blue slipper  
 clay which slips into the sea after   
 heavy rain.On the beach by the bottom 
 of my garden was a hut that got       
 smashed to pieces by a storm in May   
 this year.The land of Gurnard is      
 washing away in a few places. Along   
 the Marsh beach it is coming away     
 everywhere.When the land slips, it    
 does it gradually instead of a sheer  
 drop. To try and stop any more        
 slipping people have planted trees    
 and bushes.Down on the beach we saw   
 people had tried netting the stones   
 to stop them being washed away by the 
 sea.                                  </content>
