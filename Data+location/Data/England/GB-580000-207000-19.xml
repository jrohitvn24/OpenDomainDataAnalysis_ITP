		<title>19Happy Older Villagers.</title>
		<content>    We wanted to know if people were   
 happy to live in our area.There were  
 grumbles like poor transport          
 facilities but especially,at Langford 
 people were happy to live in the      
 village.There were only a few         
 teenagers in the village and they all 
 complained that they lived too far    
 from their friends and that there was 
 not enough to do in the village.The   
 older people recognised the problems  
 of the young and worried that the     
 village was losing its youth.
