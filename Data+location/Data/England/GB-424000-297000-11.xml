		<content> CONKERS. Two people stand about half a
 metre apart and one person holds out  
 their conker (a horse chestnut) on    
 the end of a piece of string.The other
 person takes a shot with their conker 
 and tries to split his opponent's     
 conker.If you succeed then your's is a
 'oner'.If you split a conker which is 
 a 'fiver' then yours would be a       
 'sixer'.Some people use 'laggies'     
 which are more than a year old.They   
 are rock hard and last much longer.   
 MARBLES. When you play marbles you    
 start by tapping your opponent's      
 marble to show that it is 'keeps'.    
 Then you roll the marbles about five  
 metres apart.The object of the game is
 to try to hit your opponent's marble. 
 If you do then you keep it.We invent  
 extra rules as we play.
