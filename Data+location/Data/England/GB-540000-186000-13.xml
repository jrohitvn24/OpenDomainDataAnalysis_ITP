 Christians celebrate Christmas by     
 exchanging presents, cards and money. 
 Also people put up and decorate       
 Christmas trees.Young children believe
 that Santa Claus delivers presents to 
 them. At Easter people also exchange  
 cards and give each other Easter Eggs.
 Chinese people have many customs. In  
 the New Year children and unmarried   
 people get a little red bag with money
 in from parents and relations.        
 If somebody dies a special table with 
 a picture of that person on it is set 
 up. For the next few weeks, whenever  
 the family eats, food is placed in    
 front of the picture and they bow     
 seven times in front of it.  This is  
 in remembrance of the person who has  
 died.                                 
                                       </content>
