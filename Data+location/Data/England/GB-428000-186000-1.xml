		<title>01Uffington White Horse Hill</title>
		<content> The Northern slopes of the Wessex     
 Downs fall to the Vale of the White   
 Horse. The area is dominated by the   
 White Horse Hill, with its ancient    
 styalised Horse &amp; the Hill Fort of    
 Uffington Castle, owned by the        
 National Trust &amp; open to the public.  
 It is farming country - crops, cattle 
 &amp; sheep: there is also a stud farm    
 near Woolstone. There is no other     
 industry. The villages in the vale are
 small &amp; attractive. Few of the        
 inhabitants are now needed to work on 
 the land, many are retired - often    
 from professional classes, whilst most
 others have a variety of occupations  
 in towns &amp; larger villages &amp; a few    
 commute to London. Public transport is
 minimal but almost every family has a 
 car or access to one.
