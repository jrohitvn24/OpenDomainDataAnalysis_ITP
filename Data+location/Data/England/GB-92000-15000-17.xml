		<content>   After a three year campaign mains   
 electricity is finally coming to the  
 off islands.This will replace small   
 diesal generators and provide a       
 continuous supply unlike before.      
   MAINS ELECTRICITY IS ON IT'S WAY.   
 Chattering like a machine gun the     
 pneumatic drill breaks off lumps of   
 rock.While at the other end of the    
 island the J.C.B.clatters like a tank 
 in action,battling with a slab of     
 granite.The workmen whistle and shout 
 as they dig ditches laying cable as   
 they go.Cauldrons of tar bubble and   
 steam like a witches spell as they are
 heated on gas burners to seal,the     
 transformers.The cable ship lays cable
 on the sandy bottom of the calm sea   
 while divers swim down to the seabed  
 to pin the cable to the floor.Finally 
 when their time is done the men leave.
 Mains electricity will have come.     </content>
