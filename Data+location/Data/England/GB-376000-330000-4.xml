The Postal Service makes one delivery  
each day and collects mail twice daily.
There is one sub-post office and there 
are four telephone kiosks in the area. 
Most houses have their own phones and  
there is a Telecommunication           
sub-station in the area.               
The post is delivered by van in the    
most inaccesible areas and by post men 
or women who also play a large part as 
carriers of news within the community. 
They are also very valuable as         
watchdogs for the elderly and report on
the sick and infirm.
