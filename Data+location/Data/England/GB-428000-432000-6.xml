		<content> THIS IS A POPULAR (SHOPPING CENTRE)   
 AND LOCAL POEPLE SHOP HERE ABOUT ONCE 
 A WEEK.ITS POPULARITY IS DUE TO THE   
 LOCATION OF THE CENTRE IN RELATION TO 
 DIRECT BUS ROUTE AND PLACES OF WORK.  
 POEPLE USING THE CENTRE FELT THAT MORE
 CLOTHES SHOPS AND BETTER LIGHTING ARE 
 NEEDED,AS WELL AS LESS SLIPPERY       
 FLOORS.THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ENJOYED 
 THE FRIENDLY ATMOSHERE WITHIN THE     
 CENTRE.A LOCAL (HOTEL MANAGER) FELT   
 THAT THE ENVIRONMENT AS TOO BUILT UP  
 BUT THAT RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE   
 AREA COULD BRING BUSINESS TO THE      
 HOTEL.ON INTERVIEWING (SHOPKEEPERS) IN
 THE CENTRE, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE     
 YOUNGER GENERATION IS THE PRIMARY     
 CONSUMER AND THAT SATURDAY IS THE     
 BUSIEST DAY.PEOPLE FEEL THAT          
 IMPROVEMENTS NEED TO BE CARRIED OUT   
 SOONIF THE CENTRE IS TO MAINTAIN IT'S 
 ATMOSPHERE AND STANDARDS OF SHOPPING. </content>
