		<title>04Employment in Carsington</title>
		<content> Employment in the village was chiefly 
 cocerned with lead mining until the   
 early 1900's and Quarrying still      
 continues nearby.Farming has seen the 
 five farms within the village,each    
 supporting at least one family fifty  
 years ago reduced to just one farm    
 worked by the farmer and his wife.    
  Today only four people resident      
 within the village actually gain      
 employment from within the village    
 these being the farmer and his wife,  
 the local publican and the local      
 shopkeeper.Many people now living in  
 Carsington have reached retiring age  
 but those that do work commute to     
 nearby towns such as Ashbourne,       
 Wirksworth and Matlock and to the     
 city of Derby.
