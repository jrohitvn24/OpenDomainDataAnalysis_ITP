Since New Year's Eve, The Evening      
Telegraph has launched a Cancer Scanner
Appeal to buy an 80,000 pound scanner. 
The sum of 90,000 pounds has been      
collected by the readers who held      
discos, dances, raffles, collections   
etc. Additional equipment will be      
bought for the Kettering Health        
District nuclear medicine department.  
Meanwhile patients have to travel to   
Northampton for scanner treatment.     
800 Jehovah's Witnesses from all over  
the world came to Kettering to build a 
Kingdom Hall costing 50,000 pounds. The
foundations were laid last month and   
they began building on Saturday        
morning. Of the 300 skilled workers, 50
came from Kettering and more than 100  
worked all night. People formed human  
chains to pass the bricks and 30 hours 
later the Montagu St building was done.</content>
