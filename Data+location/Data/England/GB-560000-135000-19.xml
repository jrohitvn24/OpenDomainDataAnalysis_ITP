		<content> "... Now for the interviews, bring    
 cassette recorders, knock on people's 
 doors, ask them little questions like 
 'Do you have a car or use the public  
 transport?'  'Do you keep a pet, and  
 if so more than one?'   Arrange some  
 time to interview a shopkeeper or two 
 ... Afterwards back to the same old   
 school, where we interpret our notes, 
 and write them out neatly to put in   
 our folders, and then type them on to 
 a computer disk, write them again to  
 photocopy and send them to people we  
 interviewed." (Sonia Bruce, 10)       
{  "Bells Yew Green is an attractive   
{place, Countryside lanes and views    
{which look for miles.  Over the week  
{we had lots of fun visiting people,   
{The minibus driving for miles and     
{miles,  In the back you could see the 
{children's smiles... "
