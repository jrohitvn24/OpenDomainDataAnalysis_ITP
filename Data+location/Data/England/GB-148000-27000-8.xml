 Lady and Lord St.Levan have their own 
 path and entrance to their{private    
{apartments}in the castle. In the hall 
 just inside their front door is a     
 giant sun fish found off Lands End,   
 which has a glass eye. In one of the  
 guest bedrooms is a four poster bed   
 which some people think is haunted    
 because carved on the posts are the   
 heads of Spanish soldiers who were    
 drowned in a ship wreck. The curtains 
 in the drawing room are usually kept  
 drawn to protect the paintings from   
 the bright light.                     
 Lord and Lady St. Levan also have     
 their own {private garden}with many   
 rare plants. These grow on the Mount  
 because it has a mild climate.
