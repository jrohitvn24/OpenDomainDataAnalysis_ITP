		<title>17ATTITUDES OF THE OFFLEY FOLK</title>
		<content> People responding to the question on  
 the form "What improvements to the    
 village do you suggest"? gave a wide  
 variety of responses.Several people   
 wanted better shopping facilities in  
 the village itself,others would like  
 to have a Doctor's Surgery and some   
 would like squash courts to be        
 built.Many people felt that there     
 should be many more things to occupy  
 the youngsters in the village.Some of 
 the teenagers tend to hang around the 
 street corners and make a nuisance of 
 themselves as there is little else to 
 do- so they say.                      
 There were requests made for more help
 for the housebound,more street lights,
 more houses and some at prices young  
 couples could afford,a main gas supply
 to the village and repair work to be  
 carried out on the pavements which are
 uneven and broken.                    </content>
