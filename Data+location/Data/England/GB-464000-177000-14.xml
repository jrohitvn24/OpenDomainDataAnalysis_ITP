		<title>14Page 14 Government - Closure</title>
		<content> The decision to close Goring Heath    
Endowed C/E School was made by Sir     
Keith Joseph,Secretary of State for    
Education, in May 1985, after a year   
long battle by parents and friends of  
the school to prevent the closure.     
Parents submitted objections to the    
closure proposal in December 1984. They
were hopeful that the Local Government 
Ombudsman's decision to investigate the
manner in which Oxfordshire dealt with 
the closure proposal and the fact that 
a new County Council had been elected{a
HUNG Council},might delay a final      
decision and enable the school to      
remain open. However, before the new   
Education Committee had met, Sir Keith 
Joseph stepped in to close the school. 
  The County will provide transport to 
Checkendon C/E School for those        
children transfering there. There will 
be 20 pupils when the school closes.   </content>
