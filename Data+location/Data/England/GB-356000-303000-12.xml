		<title>12Village Events - July 1985</title>
		<content>   One of the things that happened last
 week was the{village fete,}where there
 were toys to buy,{stalls}to win prizes
 on, and{games}to play. There were also
{strawberry teas}served by the         
 Brownies.                             
   Just lately a{new landlord}has moved
 into the pub called The Eagles.       
   Over the past year there has been   
{building}in Oak Meadow, and it is     
 possible that there might be building 
 on the field north of the vicarage.   
   At school we have had{sports days   
 and we are looking forward to the{six 
{week summer holiday}which begins in   
 two weeks time. There will be         
 twelve{pupils leaving}the school soon 
 and{transferring}to secondary school. 
   We have had a{Comfirmation Ceremony 
 recently at the Church, and in        
 September our village{vicar is        
{retiring.                             </content>
