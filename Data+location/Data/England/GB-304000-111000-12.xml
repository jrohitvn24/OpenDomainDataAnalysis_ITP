		<title>12HILLHEAD QUARRY</title>
		<content>  {Hillhead Quarry, Uffculme}belongs to
{English China Clays (E.C.C.) Ltd.}and 
 was opened in{1963. Twenty people}are 
 employed here and most of their       
 orders come from construction sites   
 within a twenty mile radius of        
 Uffculme. The{materials quarried}are  
 concrete aggregate and fine and coarse
 sand. Just at present there are no big
 contracts but in the recent past this 
 quarry has supplied materials for the 
 following: The{M5 Motorway}from       
 Bristol to Cullompton, Hinkley Point  
 Nuclear Power Station, Wimbleball and 
 Meldon Reserviors.There are no plans  
 to increase production but excavation 
 inevitably moves to new sites as the  
 old ones are reinstated. E.C.C. own   
 enough ground to continue quarrying on
 this site for{many years.}There is    
 speculation that a{Council Tip}may be 
 sited here and this is{not popular!   </content>
