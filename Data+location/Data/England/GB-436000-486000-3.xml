		<title>03Leachfield Grange Farm.</title>
		<content> This farm belongs to Mr.N.Bell.It has 
 four hundred and four acres.Inmost of 
 the four hundred and four acres wheat 
 is grown.The farm is a mixture of     
 growing crops and keeping stock.The   
 stock is beef cattle and sheep.We     
 visited the farm in July and the crops
 we saw were wheat,barley,corn,sugar   
 beet,peas,oil seed rape and linseed.  
 There are four people who work on the 
 farm as well as the farmer.In the     
 Second World War there were seven     
 people.Less people are needed to work 
 on a farm nowadays because machines do
 a lot of the work peole used to do and
 they do it quicker.                   
 Mr.Bell had taken some of the hedges  
 out in small fields so the tractor    
 could work more easily.
