 other vegetables and fruit.There was a
 village on this site in Saxon times   
 called Herfortune.The village now has 
 a mixture of black and white cottages 
 and modern estates.There are about    
 two thousand people living in         
 Harvington.This area is also very     
 famous for its {Blossom Trail }which  
 runs through Harvington.The river Avon
 divides Harvington from the village of
 Offenham which is a local beauty      
 spot.The Fish and Anchor Inn lies on  
 the banks of the river and can be     
 reached by a hand ferry from          
 Harvington.The river provides for     
 leisure and irrigation of the         
 surrounding area.In Littleton there is
