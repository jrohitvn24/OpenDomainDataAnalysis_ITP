		<title>06NEW INDUSTRIAL UNITS.</title>
		<content>{New Industry}has provided jobs to     
 replace those lost when the{Textile   
{Industry,}which was once{Blackburns}  
 biggest employer,went into decline and
 all but{3 Mills}have now closed.One   
 such new{Industrial Development}is in{
{Cherry Tree,}where new firms such as{ 
{C.C.T.V.}have moved into{newly built }
 premises for a variety of{reasons.    
 There are 4 small units:some firms    
 have{bought}their premises,but others 
 only{rent}them because they are{cheap}
 and offer a{convenient location}on the
 edge of town,with{easy access}to the  
 road network and their customers.     
{Thirty}people are employed on the site
 off{Preston Old Road}and the firms are
 mostly starting off in business,one   
 was only formed in Nov.84. These units
 serve as a kind of{Industrial Nursery 
 _a place to{start in}and then perhaps 
{move on}from to a{larger site}in time.</content>
