		<title>16MOOR ROW - THE VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Moor Row is a very quiet village of   
 very little but housing. It is rather 
 a dowdy and unpicturesque place.      
 Housing is typical of the area - no   
 gardens - front or back - two         
 bedroomed stone terraces. There are   
 few garages so the streets are full of
 parked cars.                          
                                       
 There is a strong objection from Moor 
 Row residents to the caravan site near
 the disused station. It has not got   
 planning permission, and indeed has   
 been ordered to cease operating by the
 council, but its owners carry on      
 letting the caravans. As fast as the  
 council rehouse people from the       
 caravans, the owners put more people  
 in, who then say they have nowhere    
 else to live, and need rehousing!     
 Local people accuse them of vandalism,
 theft and noise, and want rid of them.</content>
