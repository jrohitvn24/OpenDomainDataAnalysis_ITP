 Infants  School to talk  to  ten Asian
 children in Form 3.The area around our
 school has a  large Asian  population.
 All the  Asian  children  live  within
 walking distance of Battye Street, and
 most have relatives living nearby. The
 family  size  varies from five to ten,
 and  only  one home  had a pet.  Their
 favourite  subjects,  food,  and their
 favourite  television  programmes  are
 similar to  those of our  children, as
 are  their games. All the children are
 Muslims  and attend  the Mosque in the
 evening  reading the  Koran.  They all

 spoke  no English on  admission to the
 school.  They speak Urdu or Punjabi at
 home.  All the fathers  speak  English
