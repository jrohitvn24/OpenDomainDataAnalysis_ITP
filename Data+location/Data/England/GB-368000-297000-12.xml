 76.7%,FEMALES 46%). IN ALL 65.4%      
 WORKED IN THE PARISH,1.9% WORKED      
 ELSEWHERE,O.9% UNEMPLOYED AND 3O.9%   
 RETIRED.NEARLY 6 IN 1O OF HOUSEHOLDS  
 WERE HEADED BY MALES EMPLOYED IN      
 FARMING OR AS APLEY ESTATE WORKERS.BUT
 AGRICULTURAL EMPLOYMENT IS FALLING    
 COMPARED WITH THE NUMBERS EMPLOYED IN 
 THE 195OS.                            
 OF THE 1.9% EMPLOYED ELSEWHERE THE    
 MAJORITY WERE IN THE PROFESSIONAL     
 CLASSES EG. TOWN PLANNER,RESEARCH     
 WORKER,TEACHERS, OTHERS BEING BANK    
 CLERKS, SHOP WORKERS &amp; CAR MECHANICS.

 YOUNGER NORTON RESIDENTS WILL HAVE TO 
 WORK OUTSIDE THE AREA THUS INVOLVING  
 THEM IN A DAILY JOURNEY TO WORK.
