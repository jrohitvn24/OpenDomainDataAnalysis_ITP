		<content> The study block contains a section of 
 most interesting heathland on the edge
 of the larger Goonhilly Downs. The    
 majority of the Downs is now          
 controlled by the Nature Conservancy  
 Council (NCC) and has been designated 
 a Site of Special Scientific Interest 
 (SSSI).                               
 It is of importance for its unique    
 communities of plants and for the fact
 that it is one of the few lowland     
 heaths remaining in the Southwest.    
 The heathland is a sub-climax         
 vegetation area maintained by         
 burning,grazing and 'furze            
 cutting'.Much of its value to the     
 local people goes back to the 1700s   
 onwards when the area was croft farmed
 and small communities used it to eke

 ceased about 50 years ago.  contd...  </content>
