		<title>20HISTORY OF GOSFORTH, CUMBRIA</title>
		<content> Gosforth has a long history, although 
 there are few records, other than odd 
 documents held at St. Bees Monastery. 
 The presence of the Runic crosses in  
 the churchyard and the hog's back tomb
 show that a group of people must have 
 lived here in the 900's.The church was
 sadly improved in the 1870's, and     
 little remains to show its long       
 history.                              
   Gosforth Hall is now a hotel, but   
 the inscription,"R.&amp; I.C." dated 1673 
 can still be seen over the fireplace,&amp;
 a door heading in the barn is         
 inscribed 1658.                       
  The library used to be someone's     
 house bearing, over the doorway, the  
 names John &amp; Margret Sherwen, and the 
 date 1628.                            
  Park Nook is mentioned in writing in 
 1575,&amp; many farm houses have histories
