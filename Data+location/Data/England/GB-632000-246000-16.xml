		<content> The majority of the population in this
 area are Americans based at RAF Wood- 
 bridge. They watch British TV and some
 have video recorders.  Some of the    
 local population choose not to have   
 television, preferring to make their  
 own entertainment.  Among local people
 there is keen interest in Citizens    
 Band Radio.  There is a regional daily
 newspaper,'The East Anglian Daily     
 Times', which is widely read by locals
 and some Americans.'The Peninsular' is
 a small periodical, written, published
 and distributed every two months, by  
 local people to the residents of its  
 namessake area, a triangle of land    
 bounded roughly by the River Deben,   
 the sea, and a line from Woodbridge in
 the west to Orford in the East.  The  
 USAF base also has a weekly magazine  
 called 'Forum' publishing items of    
 topical interest.                     </content>
