		<title>03HOUSING IN WHALTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The majority of houses in Whalton are 
 grey sandstone and were built in the  
 19th.century. There is also a group of
 Council built houses originally       
 intended for agricultural workers,    
 several of which are now privately    
 owned. These together with 6 old      
 peoples' bungalows are grouped around 
 an attractive grassed area. Very many 
 of the older houses have been         
 modernised but there are still several
 rented properties which do not even   
 have indoor toilets.  All the houses  
 have mains water available. Mains     
 drainage is available in the village  
 but not to the outlying farms. One    
 farm, Ogle Dean, has no mains         
 electricity and relys on a generator. 
 Even though a very large gas line was 
 laid across our survey block recently,
 there is no gas available for domestic
 users.                                </content>
