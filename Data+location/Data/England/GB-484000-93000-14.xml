		<title>14THE PEOPLE OF SELSEY</title>
		<content>   The population of{Selsey}is about   
{9000},a large village.We had a small  
 survey and discovered that most people
 were not born in Selsey ,but in London
 and came down to Selsey in the last 14
 years,10 years after the sea wall was 
 built.Many people who live in Selsey  
 are retired but there are about 1000  
 children at the 3 schools.The most    
 popular reason people like Selsey is  
 the sea, according to our survey and  
 then the village atmosphere.The       
 quietness is quite popular also the   
 fresh air.The friendly Selsey people  
 help to make people more welcome.The  
 community spirit makes people feel    
 happier in Selsey.Most people would   
 not like Selsey to change but some    
 want more opportunities for youth,no  
 more houses,better shops,roads and    
 jobs.                                 
                                       </content>
