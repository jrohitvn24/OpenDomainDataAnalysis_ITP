		<content>  The factory has just two computers   
 but these have about fifty terminals  
 and are used for dealing with         
 production, sales, distribution,      
 accounts and management information.  
  The production of the factory is     
 taken in company lorries and trailers 
 mainly to the South and the Midlands  
 though some also goes to Northern     
 England.                              
  The company is part of the Wavin     
 Group that is the largest plastics    
 processor in Europe, with companies   
 also in Holland, Germany, France,     
 Denmark and Ireland. They have one    
 other factory in Great Britain, at    
 Ashford, that makes similar products  
 that are mainly larger than those made
 in Chippenham.
