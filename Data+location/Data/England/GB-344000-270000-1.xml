		<content> The area comprises mainly of          
 intensively cultivated grassland with 
 dairy and sheep farming together with 
 some arable farming. The other main   
 use of land is for forestry with      
 comercial growth of coniferous trees. 
 There is a small estate with shooting 
 rights. The majority of people work on
 the land although a few work in the   
 local towns of Ludlow and Leaminster. 
 A very small number work overseas.    
 There are a number of people who have 
 retired to the area. There is no      
 public transport system nor are there 
 any local amenities which means that  
 all families must have their own      
 transport.
