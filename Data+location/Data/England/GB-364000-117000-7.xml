		<title>07Small Businesses</title>
		<content> There are a number of small businesses
 in Milborne Port,they range from one  
 man operations to concerns which      
 employ a dozen people.A survey showed 
 that most of these businesses employed
 local people but that several were run
 by people from outside the village.   
 About 25% of the concerns were run by 
 women,these tended to be catering ,   
 cleaning or selling agencies.There are
 also a small number of women doing    
 outwork for local industries.The other
 75% were run by men.Most of them were 
 connected with the building trade such
 as plumbers,decorators,carpenters and 
 bricklayers.                          
 When surveyed,most proprietors saw the
 area as a good one to work in but all 
 of them complained about the poor     
 postal services in the area.
