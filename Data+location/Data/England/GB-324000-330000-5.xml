		<content> Because of the isolated location of   
 many households have{television}and   
{radio.}Few black-and-white televisions
 remain, and some houses have more than
 one television set. Some televisions  
 serve as monitors for home{computers  
 which have become popular in recent   
 years. Also some households possess   
 video tape recorders though, being    
 available only recently, these        
 appliances are not yet universal.     
 Daily newspapers and periodical       
 magazines can be purchased from the   
 little shop in Rhyd_y_croesau, though 
 a larger selection is available at    
 newsagents in Oswestry. The local     
 newspaper is the well established     
{"Oswestry and Border Counties         
{Advertizer"}which covers the main news
 and events of the area. Its editorial 
 offices are in Oswestry and microfilm 
 of past issues is kept in the library.</content>
