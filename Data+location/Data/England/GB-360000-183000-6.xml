		<title>06ALMONDSBURY FORGE.</title>
		<content>  The{Forge}has been in Almondsbury for
 250 years, and the owner has been     
 associated with it for all his working
 life. Soon he will be 80. He started  
 work there because "the pay was good  
 in those days".Orginally it was a     
{shoeing forge.                        
                                       
  Today the forge specialises in       
 making{gates}and{ornaments.}Mild steel
 is used these days as opposed to iron 
 before. The charge is Â£8 per hour of  
 work. The Forge is operating 6 days a 
 week and is very busy.                
                                       
   The owner sees forges changing in   
 the future and says women work just as
 well as men,though there are more men 
 employed there.
