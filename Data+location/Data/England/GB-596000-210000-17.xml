		<title>17Sail-Lofts</title>
		<content> By the estuary there are four sail    
 lofts dating probably from the late   
 19th century.   They are timber framed
 and weather boarded and raised on     
 saddle stones.   They are two storeys 
 high with casement windows.    In the 
 west gabieenels fronting into the     
 road, are sliding doors of horizontal 
 boarding, on each floor, the upper    
 ones approached  by ladders.   Three  
 of the lofts have hoist tackle to the 
 roof space.   The roofs are of        
 corrugated iron, except for the most  
 southern loft, which has a recent     
 asbestos roof.   These lofts have     
 recently been renovated by the        
 Manpower Services Commission on a     
 job_creation scheme and won a         
 Conservation and Design Award.
