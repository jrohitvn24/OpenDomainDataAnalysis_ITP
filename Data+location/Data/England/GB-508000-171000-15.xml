		<title>15THE WEEKEND</title>
		<content> Its Sunday morning and the last chance
 for a lie in before the start of      
 another hard week. Mum and Dad depart 
 for their regular run in Richmond Park
 and leave us to come to our own       
 senses.                               
 It always seems so hard to cycle to   
 the stables to feed the animals on the
 day after the night before. Exercising
 and working with the animals is tiring
 and Mum and Dad spend the afternoon   
 bowling at the Heathrow Bowl on the   
 outskirts of the airport. Dinner is   
 not the usual 1 o'clock event but it  
 has become later and later and we now 
 sit down to eat at about 6.o'         
 clock along with most of the bowling  
 team. The house is in havoc. At about 
 10.o'clock the visitors go home and we
 can sit down to rush what homework has
 to be done or read the Sunday p@apers 
 before it is Monday.                  </content>
