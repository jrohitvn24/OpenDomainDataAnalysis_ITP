		<title>19HOLMESFIELD PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content> Holmesfield Parish Church,St.Swithin's
 serves our area.The vicar described   
 that the Church tries to give help to 
 all sections of the community and that
 besides unemployment the main problem 
 centres around the possible loneliness
 of elderly people and lack of shopping
 facilities.Besides the 'good          
 neighbour' scheme a voluntary meals on
 wheels service also helps.            
     The church doesn't have a Sunday  
 School but it does have a 'J' (Jesus) 
 club attended by children from a wide 
 area.                                 
    The vicar also visits Penny Acres  
 School to give services and lessons   
 for the pupils.                       
    The money the church needs for its 
 activities is raised from the         
 collections at services,from garden   
 parties,jumble sales and Christmas    
 fairs.                                </content>
