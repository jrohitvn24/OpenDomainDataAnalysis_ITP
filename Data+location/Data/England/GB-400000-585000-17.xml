		<content>{1953.}The village looked very much as 
 it does now,except that the village   
 green was used as gardens.Large lime  
 trees stood inside it's North wall    
 with irish Yews planted between.These 
 gardens became less well tended as the
 inhabitants became aged,and when the  
 National Trust took over in 1958 this 
 central area was laid out as a Green. 
 So much had the numbers of estate     
 workers dwindled in the early 1950's, 
 there were almost no young people in  
 Cambo,and for a considerable time no  
 children,except those of visitors.But 
 as the National Trust increased their 
 staff,the village gradually became the
 home of young families with a lively  
 set of village children.              
 The school children used to come to   
 the village hall for thei dinner,until
 the large new hall and kitchen were   
 built on to the school in the 1970's. </content>
