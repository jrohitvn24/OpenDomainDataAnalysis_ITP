 The church serves the community of    
 Instow. It is 800 years old with      
 tombstones of that date in the        
 churchyard. The oldest part of the    
 church is the font dating from Norman 
 times. The first recorded vicar was   
 Clement De Langeford in 1260. The     
 churchyard has a well preserved       
 lychgate. One of the most             
 interesting tombstones dates from 1160
 and commemorates two children who died
 from smallpox. Today it is a lively   
 church with an active congregation. It
 is currently undergoing               
 renovations to its tower and roof. The
 present Vicar is John Spear who       
 maintains regular links with the      
 school.
