		<title>02Banwell Spring</title>
		<content>   Banwell spring is the fourth largest
 in the Mendip Hills and has never been
 known to fail. It gives approximately 
 2,300,000 gallons a day,rising to 7   
 million after heavy rain. Of this over
 2 million goes to Weston and the rest 
 flows into the River Banwell. Banwell 
 village is supplied from Cheddar      
 Resevoir and not from it's own spring.
   Around 1920 it was decided to cover 
 in the spring. This difficult job was 
 successfully carried out by an        
 engineer,H.H.Brown. The concrete      
 lining of the receiving tank was      
 re-inforced with steel.The spring is  
 connected to the Milton Road Pumping  
 Station in Weston by a 16" mains pipe.
   The water, which in the past has    
 been used in the manufacture of Bank  
 of England notes and by a brewery, is 
 exceptionally pure and only needs     
 slight chlorination.                  </content>
