		<title>17A day in the life of ......</title>
		<content> On a typical day away from school a   
 young girl will do a lot to help her  
 mum. She will go shopping and then do 
 housework such as tidying up her room.
 Boys don't do a lot of this unless    
 their parents force them to do it.    
 Usually some time is spent watching   
 television, especially after eating   
 dinner. If they have grandparents     
 living nearby they will visit them as 
 often as they can, doing things for   
 them like errands. A lot of kids go to
 discos and youth clubs if there are   
 any nearby. Discos are good because   
 everyone can get dressed up in their  
 best gear. If it is a nice summer day 
 then a lot will go to Southport which 
 is only a few miles away and has a    
 beach and fair as well as amusement   
 arcades. When at school most kids go  
 to bed about 10 o'clock.
