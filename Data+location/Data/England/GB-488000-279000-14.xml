		<content>  Close to the church are some former  
almshouses which were originally known 
as the {Montagu Hospital}. Dating from 
1611 they were built by the 1st. Lord  
Montagu to house 6 old men from the    
neighbouring villages who had no one to
look after them.  The architecture is  
imposing with a large gable, obelisks, 
sundial, coat of arms and inscription- 
  "WHAT THOV DOEST, DO YT IN FAYTH".   
We are reminded that "Tempora labuntor 
tacitisque senescimus annis"   - time  
slides by and we grow old with the     
silent years.                          
  A {Jacobean Free School}, now a house
and once the vicarage, is close by.    
Built by the same Lord Montagu the     
inscription reads: "A FREE SCHOOL FOR  
WEEKLEY AND WERCKTON FOUNDED BY NICOLAS
LATHAM CLERKE PARSON OF BARNEWELL      
S.ANDREW TO TEACH THEIRE CHILDREN TO   
WRITE AND READE."   ANNO DOMINI:1624.  </content>
