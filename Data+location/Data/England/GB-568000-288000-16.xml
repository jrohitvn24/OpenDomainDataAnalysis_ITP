		<title>16BUILDINGS IN FELTWELL</title>
		<content>   The oldest buildings in the village 
 are around St. Nicholas' church and   
 near the centre of Feltwell. The      
 oldest ones are built of clunch, which
 is blocks of chalk, dug from pits     
 locally. Some are flint and brick     
 mixed together. Many houses have tie  
 bars to hold them together. There is  
 one house with a thatched roof and    
 very many with very steep roofs       
 because they used to be thatched. Most
 of the Georgian houses around the     
 village are farmhouses. There are not 
 many Victorian houses in Feltwell.    
   New houses were built on the R.A.F. 
 Base in the 1940s. Western close      
 has council houses built after the    
 war. There are three large new estates
 built in the 1960s and 70s; mostly of 
 brick with concrete tiles on the roof 
 instead of the Norfolk pantiles which 
 the older houses have.                </content>
