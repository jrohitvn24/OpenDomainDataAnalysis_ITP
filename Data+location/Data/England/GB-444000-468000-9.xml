		<title>09GAMES CHILDREN PLAY,PART 1</title>
		<content>{It is difficult to explain why some   
{games are suddenly popular and then,  
{equally suddenly, lose their          
{popularity. Of course some games seem 
{to have their particular seasons.     
{Conkers is the obvious example but the
{same thing seems to apply to such     
{non-seasonal activities as marbles.   
{  In this area the children like to   
{play computer games when they are in  
{the house. One of the favourite games 
{here is called 'Mr Ee'. You have to   
{dig channels through the earth        
{collecting the cherries. Whilst doing 
{this you have to crush the hungry     
{Umphs and Diggers with the apples,or  
{bounce the Crystal Ball down the      
{tunnels to catch one.                 
{  'Pacman'is a little man whom you    
{move around a maze eating little dots.
{Four ghosts come after him but they   
{can be eaten by the 'Pacman'.         </content>
