		<title>12HOME LIFE</title>
		<content> Carol Barton lives at Binchester, a   
 small community just west of the A688 
 which passes through the SE corner of 
 the block. The village, built using a 
 greyish sandstone, consists mainly of 
 two long rows of terraced streets or  
 blocks (see slide 1). Carol lives in  
 one of these.                         
 "My family have lived here fourteen   
 years",she told me."My father used to 
 work at Newtons at Auckland Park until
 he injured his back. He has not worked
 since".                               
 Carol's family now depend largely on  
 her mothers employment in the local   
 glove factory (worked 12yrs here).Home
 life can be frugal at times, but for  
 Carol, a pleasantly happy girl,it also
 seems a contented one. She has friends
 here, the Comm. Centre Youth Club, &amp;in
 summer,enjoys camping."Maybe its quiet
 but people say they would never move".</content>
