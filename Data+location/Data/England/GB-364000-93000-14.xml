		<title>14Herrisons Hospital's Future</title>
		<content> At present the Mental Illness Unit is 
 providing a full Psychiatric Service  
 to both West and East Dorset. However,
 in the future, as Mental Illness      
 Services develop in East Dorset, it   
 will provide a service to patients    
 within the geographical area of West  
 Dorset.                               
 Over the last hundred years, Herrsion 
 Hospital has been extended, and today 
 it consists of a large complex group  
 of buildings.  It is quite possible   
 that over the next ten years or so,   
 many of these buildings will be       
 closed.One of the main reasons for    
 this appears to be the changing       
 attitudes towards the mentally ill.   
 Until recently they were drawn from a 
 large area to a central site, but now,
 whenever possible, former patients are
 e4ing encouraged to live more normal  
 lives in the local community.         </content>
