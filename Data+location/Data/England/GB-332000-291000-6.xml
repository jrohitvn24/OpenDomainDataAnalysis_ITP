		<title>06HOME LIFE - Lydham/More</title>
		<content>  The woman's part in the home has been
 greatly changed by{labour saving      
{devices}such as washing machines, food
 mixers, vacuum cleaners, deep freezers
 and central heating (though most homes
 still have at least one open fire). As
 some wives also go out to work, house-
 hold chores and child care are often  
 shared with husbands, enabling both to
 enjoy social pursuits. Television,    
 videos, computers, telephones and     
 radios play a large part in home life 
 of all ages.  There is{no shop}in     
 the area so people travel 2 miles to  
 Bishop's Castle or 4 miles to a large 
 supermarket at Churchstoke.  Bottled  
 milk is delivered to all households 3 
 times a week and costs 24p per pint.  
 Bread, meat, local evening and        
 National Sunday newspapers are deliv- 
 ered.  Coal and mobile library call,  
 and refuse is colllected, fortnightly.</content>
