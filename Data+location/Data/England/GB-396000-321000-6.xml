		<title>06SHUGBOROUGH PARK FARM</title>
		<content>  Shugborough Park Farm is being       
restored as a museum of agriculture,   
displaying farm machinery and local    
historic breeds of livestock.          
  The workers at the farm are members  
of the Rare Breed Society. This means  
that they can keep and breed rare      
animals that are dying out. The main   
Staffordshire animals are the Tamworth 
pigs and  Baggot goats. There are also 
Longhorn cattle, White Park  cattle,   
Shropshire and Southdown sheep,        
Gloucester Black Spots (pigs), rabbits 
and ducks such as Crested white, Black 
luger and common mallard.              
  There are also two horses, Kitty and 
Alfie. Alfie is a retired police horse,
31 years old (the oldest animal on the 
farm).                                 
  Upstairs you can see bees making     
honey and some 2-3 week old chicks and 
turkey eggs in an incubator.           </content>
