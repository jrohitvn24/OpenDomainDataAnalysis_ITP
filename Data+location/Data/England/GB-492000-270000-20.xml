		<title>20Living in Irthlingborough</title>
		<content>    A collection of the opinions of    
children who have been taking part in  
this project:                          
    Although I have not lived anywhere 
else, I like living here. It is lovely 
being so near the countryside and yet  
you are not too far from large towns.' 
    I don't like living here because   
there is nothing to do.'               
    I suppose you really need to have  
a car because the bus services are not 
very good and it is expensive to take a
family group any distance.'            
    The good thing about living in     
Irthlingborough is that you would never
get lost and most people make you very 
welcome.'                              
                                       
     As you can see, there are as many 
different opinions as there are people.
