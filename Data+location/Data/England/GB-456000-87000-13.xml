		<title>13Shopping</title>
		<content>  As there are no shops in our area    
 everyone has to travel for all their  
 requirements. The{bus services}on the 
 edge of the area are all through      
 routes and do not serve the residents.
  All the people we spoke to used      
 private cars to shop.Mr.Mills in      
 Rowlands Lane makes a trip to Tesco   
 every Wednesday.Most of the shopping  
 was done in Ryde or at Tesco.         
  Some of the residents grow their own 
 vegetables including the Aylmers at   
 Nunwell.                              
  Nunwell also has a cafe for the      
 visitors and food for this is mainly  
 delivered.Some of the cakes made for  
 the cafe are eaten by the Aylmers.    
  Sometimes there would be the need    
 for a visit to Newport and on very    
 special occasions the better off      
 families would make a shopping        
 expedition to the mainland.           </content>
