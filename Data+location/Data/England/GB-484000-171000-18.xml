		<title>18TERROR RAID AT PUBLIC HOUSE</title>
		<content> At 2am on Monday 2nd July 1985,two    
 raiders armed with a gun and jemmy    
 broke into the (Three Legged Cross) in
 Warfield. The raiders wearing red     
 stocking masks, entered the premises  
 through an upstairs toilet window. The
 landlord Mr Turton, was kept in bed   
 while his wife was forced at gunpoint 
 to go downstairs to hand over Â£1000   
 from the weekend takings. Before the  
 raiders left they tied the couple     
 together.                             
 We went to Bracknell Police Station to
 interview Sgt. Ginty about the crime. 
 Police officers were on the scene     
 within minutes and an area search     
 using sniffer dogs was made. Vital    
 clues were found. A description of the
 raiders was broadcast and road blocks 
 were set up. Apparently this is not a 
 common crime here; there is every     
 chance the culprits will be caught.   </content>
