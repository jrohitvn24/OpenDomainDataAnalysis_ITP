		<title>18A walk near Lutton.</title>
		<content>   On our walk from Lutton we went     
 through some fields used for grazing. 
 On one side there was a wood and a    
 stream. Soon we came to a road. There 
 was a cottage near-by and a wood of   
 larch trees. We went into Slade.      
 Sometimes there are sheep grazing     
 there. By Slade House is a wood and   
 there is a pony in a paddock. A path  
 goes from the drive, along by the wood
 and under the viaduct.                
   We went through the wood along a    
 path. Soon we came to a road and we   
 went along it, over a stream and when 
 we came to a T -junction we went left.
   That road led past an old station,  
 now used as a private house, and to   
 Corntown. Corntown is a hamlet of     
 mostly old houses. Then we went back  
 up the hill to Cornwood.
