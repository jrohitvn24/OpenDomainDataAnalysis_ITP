		<title>03BARCLAYS BANK AND WISBECH.</title>
		<content> As in most large towns there is a     
 branch of Barclays Bank situated in   
 the Old Market,Wisbech.This building  
 was opened in 1879 though not in the  
 name of its present owners.It was in  
 1896 that Barclays took over the      
 building when they amalgamated with   
 the Wisbech and Lincolnshire Bank.This
 bank was founded by Jonathan Peckover 
 in 1782 who had already bought a house
 on the North Brink.This house known as
 Peckover House and it is a most       
 imposing building which dominates the 
 river-side approach to Wisbech.Today  
 the house is in the hands of the      
 National Trust and is one attractions 
 for visitors to Wisbech.              
 Thus it is that an aspect of local    
 history is linked with both a broader 
 national story and a vital modern day 
 amenity.
