		<content> The present manager has been in       
 charge of the{box factory}at          
 Latchley for ten years.This factory   
 has been in existence for{thirteen    
{years.}There are only{three employees 
 on the premises. The box factory makes
 all sorts of items, such as{coasters  
 and{table mats}as well as{egg         
{cartons}and{packaging}for various     
 goods. They use{cardboard}to make     
 their boxes. Their supply of cartons  
 and items extends as far as Penzance, 
 and the{delivery of these goods}is    
{made by van.}Thousands of boxes are   
 made in just one week.The supply of   
 boxes increases as is necessary, in   
 the harvest time. A  drop in the      
 number of market gardeners does       
 affect the demand for boxes locally.
