		<title>02LANDSCAPE-RIVER DARENTH</title>
		<content>  he river Darent runs past our school 
field. Many of us live in Eynsford and 
Farningham which would probably not    
exist if it was not for our river.     
Relics of settlements have been found  
proving that man has always lived near 
it. Ancient Britons called it Durentio 
meaning oak river because then the     
valley was covered with oak trees. In  
our area there is an Anglo Saxon Burial
ground and three Roman Villas so it has
always been a good place for man to    
live. We have found out that the river 
used to be much wider and deeper, so   
ships could use it. The Domesday Book  
describes a fishery at Eynsford. Today 
the Darent is getting narrower. Last   
year we had a pageant in Farningham    
some people played Vikings who sailed  
up the river, which is impossible      
today.
