		<content> The Pioneer Stores is managed by an   
 Indian family who moved to Silver End 
 about 18 months ago.Their daughter    
 attends Silver End School.The family  
 like the village but may return to    
 India sometime,where their relatives  
 still live.The school caretaker has   
 lived in Silver End for over 50 years 
 The family moved from Wales when he   
 was five.He attended the school,which 
 was smaller then,as was the village.  
 He owned the Hardware shop until 7    
 years ago,when he took up his present 
 job.The first villagers were all      
 Crittall workers,but gradually the    
 population has increased.During the   
 2nd World War there were a number of  
 Polish refugees,some of whom stayed   
 on.The families that came to the new  
 village were from a varied background,
 industrial and mining as well as from 
 many Essex towns and villages.        </content>
