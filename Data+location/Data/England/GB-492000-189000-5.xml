		<title>05The Court</title>
		<content>Before the building was a magistrates  
court it was a police station and      
was built in 1870.There were 4  cells  
in the building.These were called      
uncertified cells because nobody was   
allowed to stay in them overnight      
because there are no facillities for   
them. The main courtroom has a long    
very high bench at the far end with    
the Royal Crest over the top of        
it.There can be a maximum of 7         
magistrates,and a minimum of 2 can be  
asked to sit.The accused stands in     
the dock.The other large room,again    
a court room,was the juniville court.  
This is where offenders from the age   
10- 17 are brought before the          
magistrates. The court sits daily      
with the exeption of Thursday.20% of   
all crimes can be tried at this        
court.The maximum  penalty that        
someone can have is 6 months in prison.</content>
