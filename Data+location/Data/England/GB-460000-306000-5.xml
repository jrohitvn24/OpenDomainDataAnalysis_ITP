 most important activity allied to the 
 hire of video films from local retail 
 outlets.Going out for a drink/meal is 
 increasingly popular and there are    
 many public houses and restaurants in 
 the area.                             
 Active sports e.g. football,bowls and 
 tennis are still played in local      
 recreational areas and cricket is very
