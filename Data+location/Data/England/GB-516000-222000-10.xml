		<title>10FAUNA IN THE PRESTON AREA</title>
		<content> The fauna is varied and the largest   
 animals seen in the area are Roe deer.
 The herd numbers over 20 and is in_   
 creasing.They graze on the growing    
 crops and other vegetation and have   
 become a problem to local farmers.The 
 original members of the herd escaped  
 from the deer park at Kings Walden.   
 There are many Muntjak deer also which
 live in the woodland.Hares,rabbits and
 grey squirrels are plentiful and foxes
 are regularly hunted in the area.There
 are a few badgers in the woodland but 
 they are rarely seen by day.The bird  
 life is extensive and the natural pop_
 ulation is enhanced by large numbers  
 of pheasants and a few partridge which
 are bred in captivity for the shooting
 season on the two large privately_    
 owned estates in the locality.
