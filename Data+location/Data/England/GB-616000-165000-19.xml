  WHERE I LIVE THERE IS LOTS OF SPACE  
 TO PLAY OUT BECAUSE NOT MUCH TRAFFIC  
 COMES DOWN OUR ROAD. IN MY SPARE TIME 
 I GO DOWN THE PARK AND BEACH WHICH ARE
 NOT VERY FAR AWAY. WHEN I HAVE TO RUN 
 ERRANDS IT IS NOT VERY FAR AWAY TO THE
 SHOPS BUT THE TOWN IS. SCHOOL IS CLOSE
 AND SOMETIMES WE GO IN THE CAR. I ALSO
 GO DOWN TO MY ALLOTMENT WHICH IS      
 NEARBY.  THE RAILWAY STATION IS ONLY  
 AT THE BOTTOM OF MY ROAD.             
                                       
  I PLAY WITH MY FRIEND JAMES AND WITH 
 MY RABBIT AND A TORTOISE. I LIVE IN   
 LINDEN AVENUE AND WE GO TO SCHOOL     
 BETWEEN 8.45 A.M AND 3.OO P.M. WHICH  
 IS QUITE A LONG TIME.                 
                                       
 SOMETIMES I GO OVER TO THE GOLF LINKS 
 WITH MY MUM, DAD AND SISTER.
