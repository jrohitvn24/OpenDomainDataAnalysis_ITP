		<title>20Housing in Hebden Bridge</title>
		<content> Hebden Bridge is a valley town in the 
 Pennines. The valley sides are steep  
 and much of the housing is built on   
 the hillsides. As a former mill town  
 most of the houses are between one and
 two hundred years old and are of the  
 terrace type. There is of course a    
 variety of dwellings including        
 detached, semi-detached, bungalows,   
 farmhouses on the hilltops, and flats.
 The most interesting is the{double    
{decker terrace type house}built in the
 valley sides. One side of the terrace 
 has three or four storeys while the   
 other may have only two or three      
 storeys with one family living at the 
 front and another family living in the
 rear house. Access to these houses is 
 by a road to the front and a lane or  
 "ginnel" at the back. Some of these   
 roads still have stone 'setts' or     
 cobbles dating back to the 19th cent. </content>
