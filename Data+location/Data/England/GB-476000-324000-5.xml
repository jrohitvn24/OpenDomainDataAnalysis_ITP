		<title>05Changes in Village Life</title>
		<content> Mrs Pearson has lived in Scalford all 
 her life and was married here 40 years
 ago. She says that Scalford has       
 changed a great deal since her        
 marriage.                             
     There were more shops in 1945 so  
 that the people didn't need to go to  
 town so often. There was a skittle    
 alley in the pub called the Plough,   
 and many more clubs and activities for
 the villagers to enjoy. Now many of   
 these have disappeared or changed.    
     Queens Close was a play area then 
 for the village children, where they  
 used to play such games as whip and   
 top, as well as football.Now houses   
 have been built there.                
     More people worked in the village 
 then, now most people travel out to   
 work. Mrs Pearson feels that Scalford 
 was a closer community in those days, 
 although it is still a friendly place.</content>
