		<content> This area has a great deal to         
 recommend it.It's current attributes  
 are:-superb views, minimal man-made   
 development,typical flora and fauna   
 and varying types of farmland and     
 woodland.The views will remain a part 
 of the area always but the rest are   
 always at risk.   Proposals for the   
 upgrading of the C13 road will,if they
 reach fruition,bring increased heavy  
 traffic and the possibility of        
 development along it's verge.Changes  
 in farming and tree management may    
 upset the delicate balance of flora   
 and fauna. Intensive techniqiues may  
 destroy the remaining downland.Only   
 time will tell.   The project has been
 carried out by a small band of        
 villagers from Sutton Waldron helped  
 by some of the village children.
