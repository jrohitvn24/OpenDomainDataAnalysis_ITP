		<title>20LOCAL HISTORY OLD CROSSES</title>
		<content> In the church yard just outside the   
 church door stands the upright of a   
 granite cross.Each of the four sides  
 is decorated with Celtic patterns.This
 cross shaft is reputed to be one of   
 the finest in Cornwall and it probably
 dates from about the 10th century.Mr  
 Axford,a well known local historian,  
 believes this cross was associated    
 with a college of priests at St Neot  
 in the time of the Norman             
 Conquest.There are also four other    
 ancient crosses nearby.There is a     
 Latin cross which originally came from
 St Kew and three fifteenth century    
 Latin crosses in the garden of the    
 vicarage.One of these crosses came    
 from the Crow Pound (see page 19) on  
 Goonzion Downs.There are also ancient 
 crosses at Hilltown,                  
 Polmenna,Newtown,Tredinnick Chapel    
 and at Wenmouth Cross.                </content>
