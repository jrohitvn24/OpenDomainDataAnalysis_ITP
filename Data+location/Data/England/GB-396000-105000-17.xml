 On Sunday I got up at 11 o'clock and  
 Eleanor was making a mess and I       
 couldn't get up because Eleanor had   
 made such a mess that I couldn't even 
 stand up in my bedroom. When Eleanor  
 had tidied it up I got up and changed 
 into my clothes I had my breakfast at 
 12 o'clock and then we went           
 blackberrying in our garden. Then we  
 went looking for cooking apples, when 
 we had done that we had to get ready  
 for Daddy to go to Bristol. I had fish
 for tea.
