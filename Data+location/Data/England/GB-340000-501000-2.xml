		<content> The deep and steep sided valley of the
 Trout beck is the dominant feature of 
 the area (although "river" gives a    
 more accurate indication of its size  
 than "beck"). The land rises steadily 
 on its western side from the valley   
 floor at about 120m., via Troutbeck   
 village at about 180m. to over 350m.  
 above sea level. The eastern slope is 
 steeper, rising in the same distance  
 to over 475m.                         
 As in the rest of the Lake District,  
 glaciation has had a marked effect on 
 landscape. The valley has the usual   
 U-shaped cross section although the   
 floor is choked with moraine deposits 
 especially in the south. It widens    
 towards the north as an old lake bed  
 is approached. There is a marked      
 contrast between the rough grazing    
 above the village and the improved    
 pasture below it.                     </content>
