		<title>11Marldon Footpaths</title>
		<content> Marldon has many footpaths and 'green 
 lanes'. Being near Torquay and        
 Paignton most of them are well used by
 walkers, horse riders and motor       
 cyclists who like rough riding. They  
 are specially pleasant in the spring  
 with the primroses.                   
 One footpath starts on the ring road  
 and then goes to Stantor and on to    
 Cockington. Another, with good views, 
 goes from Compton Castle to Style Park
 Nurseries. Well used by horse riders  
 is the one from Wrigwell in the n.w.  
 of our block, top the Marldon-Ipplepen
 road, and then along a green lane     
 called Aptor Lane. You can follw this 
 all the way to Berry Pomeroy castle.  
 You can walk up to Beacon Hill, where 
 the T.V. and police radio masts       
 are. The Beacon was used for an alarm 
 fire in the times of Elizabeth 1.
