		<content>   I am 9 years old and I live in a    
 terraced house which has two small    
 gardens where I sometimes play. I also
 play in the street with my friends but
 I am not allowed to play in the park  
 because my mum says there are a lot of
 glue-sniffers there. Near our house   
 there is a beck but not much else of  
 interest. In our house we have an     
 organ, a video, two televisions and   
 two record players.                   
 Another 9 year old writes: My house is
 a detached house, it is big and has   
 two gardens. Around our house there is
 a park,a football pitch and a river to
 watch. We play in the street or on the
 football pitch or sometimes in the    
 park. At home I like to use my radio  
 and the television with the video. We 
 also have a record player in the      
 living room.
