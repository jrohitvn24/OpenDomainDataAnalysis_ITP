		<title>15LOCAL CHURCHES</title>
		<content>In the grounds of Mongewell Park       
{Carmel College}stands the Church of   
St John the Baptist.Although           
originally Norman,it has mostly fallen 
into ruin.                             
The east end (chancel and altar)has    
been restored to form a tiny chapel.   
Services are occasionally held here in 
the summer.At the ruined west end is   
t{he tomb of Shute Barrington,who was  
Bishop of Durham and an owner of       
Mongewell House at the turn of the     
19th  century.In the tiny hamlet of    
Newnham Murren (parish of Crowmarsh    
)down a side road marked "private" off 
the A4074, there is an originally      
Norman church.There is a brass to      
Letitia Barnard dated 1593,which has a 
Civil War bullet.The key is at the     
nearby farmhouse.
