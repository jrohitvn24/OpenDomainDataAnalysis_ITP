		<title>20CUB SCOUTS IN KELVEDON</title>
		<content>{Cubs}are held at the Scout hut which  
 is near our school. I am in a pack    
 called{"Eagles"}which has meetings    
 every Tuesday at 6.15 p.m. There's    
 another pack called{"Panthers"}who    
 meet on Thursday. Before you can be a 
 cub you have to be{"Invested".}This is
 a small ceremony when you say your Law
 and Promise. After a while you become 
 a seconder and you are given a badge  
 to wear on your right arm. A little   
 later you get your sixer badge which  
 goes under your seconder badge. There 
 are many activity badges to do like:- 
 fishing, sportsman, swimming, animal  
 lover, home-help and many more. Each  
 year we go to camp where we cook our  
 meals over a camp-fire. We cook       
 sausages, baked beans, bacon and eggs.
 Each month the six with the most      
 points wins the gold woggles.
