		<content> There is no industry in this area now 
 but from the 18th century onwards     
 there was a thriving coal-mining      
 industry on Clee Hill.                
 Coal was first mined in bell-pits at  
 Crumps Brook from about 1760.There are
 still mounds showing where the pits   
 were in the area known as             
 Lubberland. Later on shafts were sunk 
 to reach lower layers of coal in the  
 Whatsill and Magpie area, as more coal
 was needed for melting iron.          
 As the demand for Clee Hill coal      
 became less and pits were             
 exhausted, coal-mining on Clee Hill   
 ceased before 1940. The men went to   
 work in the mine at Highley until that
 closed in 1970.                       
 The slag heaps which were left have   
 now been covered over with grass and  
 other plants making mounds on the     
 hill.                                 </content>
