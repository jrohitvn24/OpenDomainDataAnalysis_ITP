		<content> It was a Friday afternoon in December 
 and we were all at school. It was     
 raining very fast and it seemed as if 
 it would never stop. The playground   
 was like a lake and Lawefield Lane was
 also flooded and running like a river.
 About 2 o'clock it was so bad that    
 people were ringing home for their    
 parents to come and collect them      
 because the water was rising rapidly. 
 I didn't get home until after 3       
 o'clock and I was soaked. When I saw  
 our house I was very upset. The water 
 had got in and it was a foot deep all 
 downstairs. Luckily my brother Chris  
 had not been working so when he saw   
 the water rolling up the garden he    
 took the television and video         
 upstairs. The suite would not go up so
 the rims of it got soaked. We had only
 decorated 3 weeks before and we had to
 redecorate with a new carpet as well. </content>
