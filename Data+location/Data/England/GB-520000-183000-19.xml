		<title>19SCHOOL LIFE IN WILLESDEN GRN</title>
		<content> I am a 4th year pupil of{St.Mary      
{Magdalen's R.C.J.M.School.}Very soon, 
 my friends and I will be leaving to   
 start our secondary schools. I will   
 miss this school and the staff very   
 much. As a 4th year,I have more       
{responsibility}e.g.as a prefect I help
 to look after the younger children.The
 school has changed a lot even since I 
 started. We have{two computers}now and
 lots of calculators too. After school,
 we have the chance to join many clubs 
 or groups. There are clubs for  Drama,
 Creative Dance, Football, Netball and 
 Short Tennis. There are also groups   
 for recorder and guitar. I like making
 music and during the year I was       
 involved in a concert,an assembly and 
 a Mass with my class or year group.   
 Many of us are involved in clubs out  
 of school.Most common are the{Cubs,   
{Brownies and Irish dancing clubs.     </content>
