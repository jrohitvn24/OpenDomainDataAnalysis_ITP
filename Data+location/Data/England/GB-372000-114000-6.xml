		<title>06BLACKMORE VALE MIXED FARMING</title>
		<content> Here is a completely isolated area    
 served by a rough track, with one     
 deserted house.Mostly the land cover  
 is the outlying pastures of a big farm
 with a small area of barley.          
 Hotham Plantation,a cultivated        
 woodland area of 12 acres,consists of 
 well grown oak and ash trees with     
 hazel and bramble undergrowth.Roughly 
 3 acres have been newly planted with  
 young beech trees well protected from 
 rabbits by plastic sheaths around the 
 trunks.A well used bridle path circles
 this plantation.Young pheasants and   
 grey squirrels are seen.The well      
 trimmed hedgerows have the usual      
 plants,nettles,hedge-parsley,comfrey. 
 No one lives in this area which       
 probably has no water or electricity  
 supplies.In fact not even a good road.
 But in spite of the lack of amenities 
 it is a most productive area.         </content>
