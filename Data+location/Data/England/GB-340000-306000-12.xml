		<title>12A PONTESBURY SCHOOLGIRL</title>
		<content> Sarah gets up at 7.30 every weekday.  
 She has cereal and toast for breakfast
 and then puts on her grey school      
 uniform.  She collects the books she  
 needs for her lessons and her pens,   
 pencils and geometry instruments.  She
 cycles to the 'bus stop to catch the  
 School Bus.                           
 The school day begins at 9 o'clock.   
 Some days start with Assembly.  There 
 are five lessons during the day, with 
 Clubs at lunchtime and after school.  
 There is lunchtime detention for those
 who misbehave.  Sarah studies Maths,  
 English, French, Art, Home Economics, 
 Music, Humanities and Metalwork or    
 Woodwork.  Her favourite subject is   
 Art.  Every night there is homework,  
 usually two or three subjects.  She   
 gets home at 4 o'clock, ready for a   
 typical tea of beefburgers and chips. 
 Sarah goes to bed by 9.30pm.          </content>
