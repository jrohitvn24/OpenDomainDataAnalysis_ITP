		<content> In Hawkchurch they have only got a    
 small school with 2 classes which are 
 an infant and a junior class.All      
 together there are 21 children. When  
 we interviewed 2 children , we asked  
 them what games they play; they said  
 that they  play football, hopscotch , 
 cricket and sevensies but mostly they 
 like playing etball and rounders. This
 is how to play sevensies: you have to 
 bounce a ball against a wall seven    
 times then six times and so on to     
 zero. If you drop it you have to start
 again.
