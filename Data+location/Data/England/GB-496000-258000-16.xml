		<title>16Felmersham Nature Reserve</title>
		<content> This reserve is 53 acres of peace and 
 beauty.                               
 Following the{extraction of gravel    
 from riverside fields in the 1940's,  
 shallow lakes with islands were       
 formed.  The islands and margins have 
 been colonised by a wealth of         
 vegetation.  The deliberate creation  
 of marsh, woodland and grassland      
 habitats by the{Beds &amp; Hunts          
{Naturalist Trust}has further enhanced 
 the site.                             
 The reserve attracts many leisure     
 seekers.  For the{angler}there are    
 course fish, possibly including 25lb. 
 pike; for the{country lover,}tranquil 
 walks in fragrant meadows inhabited by
 butterflies, dragonflies and damsel   
 flies; the{serious naturalist}may find
 bee orchids, bean aphids or           
 grasshopper warblers.
