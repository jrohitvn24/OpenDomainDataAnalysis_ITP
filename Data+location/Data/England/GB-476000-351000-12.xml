		<title>12Knackers yard, Newark</title>
		<content> The knackers yard smelt horrible as we
 entered it, especially as it was very 
 warm weather.  The man told us that   
 you get used to the smell after a     
 while.  In one shed were horses and   
 cows carcases hung up. These were     
 unfit for human consumption so they   
 were used for dog meat &amp; for feeding  
 the maggots while they bred there. The
 fat is used to make soap.  The maggot 
 farm was right next door. There were  
 trays full of maggots which were dyed 
 different colours to attract different
 types of fish when they were used for 
 angling.  The flies which produced the
 maggots fed on rotten fish and sugar.
