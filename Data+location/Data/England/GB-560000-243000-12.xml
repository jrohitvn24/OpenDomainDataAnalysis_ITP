		<title>12Footpaths at Castle Camps</title>
		<content> Most of the footpaths are used in     
 Castle Camps. The famous one is the   
 church path. My mum use to go up the  
 church path when she was small.There  
 are several footpaths in Castle Camps 
 though I dont know how many.Nearly    
 every Sunday we go up to the church   
 path. Some of the foot paths are short
 and ploughed up.The footpaths are used
 every day,or nearly every day.Some of 
 the foot paths go from Castle Camps   
 and right down to Shudy Camps.Some of 
 the footpaths have seats to stop at.  
 Two years ago, a teacher used to run a
 Footpath Club, during which we walked 
 paths to help keep them open. Farmers 
 plough very near the edges sometimes.
