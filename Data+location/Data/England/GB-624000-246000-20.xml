		<title>20CHANGE IN MARTLESHAM VILLAGE</title>
		<content> We talked to a lady who had lived in  
Martlesham for 30 years and from her   
we've learnt how the village has       
changed in that time.                  
 The village has grown a lot. The main 
road or A12 was much narrower than it  
is now and Bealings Road, School Lane  
and the Felixstowe Road were the only  
other roads. The Blacktiles Estate and 
Redwold Close were built in the 1950's 
and 1960's and since then Viking       
Heights and Angela Close.              
 The water main only reached the Police
House - houses to the east along the   
A12 {drew water from wells}. The only  
shop was the Post Office, near the Red 
Lion, which sold food. There was a     
{forge} which has now closed.          
 St Mary's Church has not been altered,
but the number of Sunday services are  
fewer now.
