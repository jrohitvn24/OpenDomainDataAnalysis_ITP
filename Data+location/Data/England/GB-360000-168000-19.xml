		<title>19St Peter's Hospice</title>
		<content> A hospice was originally a shelter    
 where travellers could be cared for.  
 Today{St.Peter's Hospice (Knowle)}    
 provides a source of care and support 
 for those people suffering from       
 progressive and incurable diseases.   
 When death is near patients are       
 brought to St.Peter's Lodge to spend  
 their last hours in a caring          
 atmosphere. Nurses are specially      
 qualified to support such people who, 
 in pain, are frightened of death and  
 powerful drugs are used to alleviate  
 needless pain. Nurses also visit homes
 of the incurably ill at all hours of  
 the day and night. This is a{Christian
 foundation which has evolved over the 
 centuries and is supported by many    
 voluntary contributions and a great   
 deal of help from local benefactors.  
 The nurses are the only salaried      
 members of the St.Peters Hospice.     </content>
