		<title>11North Anston</title>
		<content>{North Anston}is a village in{South    
{Yorkshire}which is 12 miles from      
 Sheffield and 6 miles from Worksop.   
 Most of the Anston area is farmland   
 and there are still farms in the      
 village. The boundary between North   
 Anston and South Anston is Anston     
 Brook but the A57 road leading to     
 Worksop and Sheffield is often        
 mistaken for the boundary. To the     
 north is{Dinnington}to which most of  
 the population of Anston go shopping.{
{Dinnington Colliery}employs people    
 from Anston as well as the surrounding
 district. Permian Magnesian Limestone 
 used to be quarried in Anston and some
 of the stone was used to build the    
 Houses of Parliament. Most of the     
 older cottages were built from the    
 local limestone. Housing estates were 
 built in the 1950s and 1960s but many 
 new houses are still being built.     </content>
