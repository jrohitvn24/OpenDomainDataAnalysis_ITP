		<content>      Ham Hill is a popular walking    
 place for the people of the nearby    
 towns and villages.  There are quite a
 few land marks on the hill.           
      The{Monument}is seen clearly from
 the surrounding area.  It has the     
 names of the local people who died    
 during the world wars. There are some 
 slendid views to be seen here of the  
 countryside.                          
      The{Bomb Shelter}has been used   
 during the last world wars. It is very
 small and compact. There is also a    
 destroyed Bomb Shelter which is       
 covered with rocks.                   
      Ham Hill is also used for        
{quarrying stone (Ham Stone)}some of   
 which is used for the local houses.   
      Children and Families like to    
 play games and have picnics and       
 barbecues there.  It is a child's     
 paradise.                             </content>
