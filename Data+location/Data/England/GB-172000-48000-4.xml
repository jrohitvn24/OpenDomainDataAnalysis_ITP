		<title>04St. Agnes: Thomas Tonkin</title>
		<content> Born in 1678, Thomas Tonkin was the   
 second son of Hugh and Frances Tonkin 
 who lived at Trevaunance, St. Agnes.  
 In 1696 he drove a mile-long leat from
 the tail of Pell adit - restoring the 
 water level to eleven sets of stamps  
 and a gaunt, grist mill.              
 In 1699 he married Elisabeth Kempe and
 they had 8 children.  He died in 1742.
 Tonkin played the "Squire" of the     
 village, spending money he could ill- 
 afford on the small harbour and quay  
 at Trevaunance Cove, St. Agnes.       
 Tonkin (described by H.L.Douch as "The
 neglected historian") wrote of St.    
 Agnes "It has forty houses and a      
 weekly market for all sorts of wares  
 and victuals - except corn".  He tried
 to obtain a patent for a market and   
 two fairs yearly.  This was granted   
 but later revoked.
