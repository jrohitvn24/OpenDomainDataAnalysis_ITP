		<content>Norbury Church serves the villages of  
Roston and Norbury and has currently 55
people on Church Electoral Roll, with  
an average of 27 regular Sunday        
worshippers, giving approximately 37   
pounds between them each week.         
  In recent years the Great East Window
has been altered and restored.  The    
work was completed in 1983 and a Flower
Festival to mark the completion of 10  
years glass restoration was held in May
1984.  The work, carried out by        
D.King and Sons of Norwich, entailed   
carefully cleaning the glass with      
specially discovered techniques and    
releading it.  The span of the Great   
East Window is about 18ft 6in by 28ft  
and the glass has been sheeted in a    
very tough layer of plain glass to     
protect it from the lichen.
