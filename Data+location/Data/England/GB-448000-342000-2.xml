		<title>02Nuthall:about the village</title>
		<content>   Nuthall is a quiet and peaceful     
 place . It was a small village but it 
 has grown and new houses have been    
 built, the Larkfields and Horsendale  
 Estates.                              
   The{A610}road splits Nuthall into   
 two halves and joins the nearby{M1    
{MOTORWAY}at junction 26. The motorway 
 goes over part of the village on a    
 flyover.                              
   There are 2 churches in the village 
 Nuthall Methodist Church and Saint    
 Patrick's Church, and there are three 
 schools, Larkfields Infant, Larkfields
 Junior, and Horsendale Primary. There 
 are a few shops and two Pubs. Close to
 the village is a coal mine,{BABBINGTON
{COLLIERY.}Most of the land round      
 Nuthall is farmland, and just outside 
 the village is a small lake called    
 Temple Lake. Nottingham is the nearest
 city.                                 </content>
