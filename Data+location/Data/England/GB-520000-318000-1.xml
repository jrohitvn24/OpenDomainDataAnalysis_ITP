		<content> This area is mainly farmland. The A16 
 trunk road passes through from        
 Spalding to Market Deeping. The people
 mostly live in houses near to this    
 road and either work on local farms or
 travel by car, bus or train to        
 Spalding or Peterborough to work in   
 offices, shops or factories. The only 
 other housing is farm houses usually  
 reached by farm roads leading from the
 the minor roads crossing the area. The
 landscape is very flat and drainage   
 dykes are a feature of this type of   
 land on which sugar beet and cereal   
 crops are mainly grown. The River     
 Welland also passes through part of   
 this section and a feature of this is 
 the high banks formed to stop         
 flooding. The banks provide occasional
 grazing for cattle. The rail link     
 between Spalding and Peterborough is  
 also seen crossing this section.      </content>
