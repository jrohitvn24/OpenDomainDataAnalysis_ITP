		<content> These are the industries in our block.
 Local shops. Antique shop. Farming.   
 Garden Centre. Brewery. Builders.     
 Two of the shops in our block are just
 general stores, one of them also acts 
 as a Post Office. The antique shop    
 sells a large variety of              
 goods,especially things made out of   
 brass. There is also a small          
 collection of pictures and old        
 furniture. There are some china items 
 also on display. There are six main   
 builders on our block. Most of them   
 just do general repairs,but one of    
 them builds houses and is a much      
 larger company than the others.       
 Agriculture is the main industry in   
 our block. The brewery has just opened
 up in our village,it sells real ale.My
 teacher says it tastes great! One of  
 our local shops has just closed down. 
 It has been turned into a Tea Room.   </content>
