		<title>15THELWALL'S SUPERNATURAL TALE</title>
		<content> The Little Manor in Thelwall was built
 in 1642 for a General in Oliver       
 Cromwell's army. He lived there for   
 many years until tragedy overtook his 
 family in the form of his death at the
 hands of the housemaid  whom he loved.
                                       
   She murdered him in the porchway    
 during a fit of rage when he tried to 
 disentangle himself from her          
 affections. Overcome by remorse, she  
 then hanged herself on a tall fir tree
 in the driveway.                      
                                       
   It is common knowledge with the     
 local people that the HOTEL is{haunted
 by the{ghost}of this young woman whose
 name was Rachel. There is even a bar  
 named after her at the Little Manor   
 Public House.
