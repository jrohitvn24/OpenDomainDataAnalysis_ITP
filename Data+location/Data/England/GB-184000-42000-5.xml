		<content> Hurling the Silver Ball is an ancient 
 Cornish game which is still played in 
 Saint Columb.In this game two teams   
 made up of people from the village and
 its surrounding area,called Town or   
 Country try to score a goal with a    
 ball made of apple wood and covered in
 silver.The goals are about three miles
 apart and the game can last all day.It
 starys in the village and the teams   
 frequently stop to allow spectators to
 touch the ball for luck.The game is   
 very rough and amongst the 100 or 200 
 players there are quite often broken  
 arms and legs but scoring a goal      
 entitles you to keep the ball provided
 that you pay for another to be made.A 
 new ball costs several hundred pounds 
 and around it on the silver is        
 engraved Town and Country do your     
 best.
