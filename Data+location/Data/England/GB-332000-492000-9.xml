		<content>{   The playground,}which was          
 built by local volunteers (map ref.   
 336925), was opened on the 9th July   
 1983. The Silver Jubilee Fund and the 
 Rawdon-Smith Trust in Coniston gave   
 some money to buy the land and        
 equipment.                            
                                       
    At the time of writing there are 2 
 big swings and 2 low swings, a slide  
 and 2 tunnels. There is also a big    
 log and a wooden rabbit. The slide is 
 the most popular with the children.   
 There are 2 badminton courts and a    
 rounders pitch.                       
                                       
    The committee are hoping to buy a  
 large new wooden climbing frame soon. 
 They are also going to buy a hut to   
 house the grass cutting machines;     
 the grass is cut once a week in the   
 summer by members of the committee.   </content>
