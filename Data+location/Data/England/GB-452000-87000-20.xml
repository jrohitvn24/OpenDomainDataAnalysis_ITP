    The Calbourne, which was the first 
 locomotive purchased by the 'Wight    
 Locomotive Society', is the last of   
 the larger O2 class engines.  It was  
 designed by William Adams for the     
 London and South Western Railway.  It 
 was made at Nine Elms at the cost of  
 Â£1,5OO.  It still runs at the station.
   The 'Invincible' locomotive, built  
 in 1915, was reconditioned in 1959 and
 bought for the society in 1971.  Since
 1978, when it was refurbished, it has 
 been one of the main locos used at    
 Havenstreet.                          
  Various carriages, road vans and     
 cattle wagons etc. are scattered      
 around the station.  A lot are        
 deteriorating, but parts are used to  
 servive other engines.
