		<content> CONSIDERABLE LOACAL FEELING HAS BEEN  
 RAISED OVER PLANS TO ALTER THE PATTERN
 OF ROADS ACROSS THE FAMOUS GREEN IN   
 GREAT BENTLEY. NUMEROUS ACCIDENTS HACE
 OCCURED AT THE CROSS-ROADS AT THE     
 CENTRE OF THE GREEN AND NOW ONE OF THE
 ROADS HAS BEEN CLOSED, MAKING A TEE   
 JUNCTION.  PART OF THE GREEN IS TO BE 
 USED TO MAKE A NEW ROAD AND THE       
 MAJORITY OF LOCAL PEOPLE WOULD APPEAR 
 TO OPPOSE THIS . THE BUIL;DING OF A   
 NEW DUAL CARRIAGEWAY CONNECTING       
 CLACTON AND COLCHESTER HAS INCREASED  
 TRAFFIC THROUGH THE VILLAGE WHICH HAS 
 AGGRAVATED THE PROBLEM.               
 FIVE NEW HOUSES HAVE BEEN BUILT, WITH 
 PLANS FOR TEN MORE.  THIS IS THE      
 LARGEST NUMBER OF HOUSES BUILT IN THE 
 VILLAGE FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS.    
 PLANS ARE ALSO WELL ADVANCED FOR A NEW
 VILLAGE HALL/COMMUNITY CENTRE WHICH   
 HAS CAUSED GREAT EXCITEMENT.          </content>
