{Castle Cary}was mentioned in the      
 original{Domesday Book}of 1086.It was 
 part of a barony held by Walter of    
 Douai.There was land for 20           
 ploughs(a plough being enough land for
 a family to farm and support itself   
 on).This amounted to about 2,000 acres
 being farmed.At that time 23 villagers
 and 20 small holders with 17 ploughs,7
 hides and 3 mills were recorded.Land  
 cover was said to be 100 acres meadow 
 and woodland 1 league square.         
 The name of{Castle Cary}appears to    
 have derived from the building of a   
 castle at the source of the River     
 Cary.Today the site is hard to see and
 the source of the river is now a pond 
 called Park Pond.
