		<content> The church dedicated to{St. Mary}lies 
 on rising ground at the eastern edge  
 of the town. A stream separates the   
 town from the church. Parts of the    
{chancel }and{north transept}are the   
 oldest being built around{1250.}The   
 main part of the church was built in  
 the{14th century}and the{tower}and    
{porch}were added in the{15th          
{century.}There are six bells in the   
 tower and the oldest bells are 18th   
 century. At this end of the church    
 there is a plain round{font}which is  
 very old. Next to the porch is a small
 tower with stone steps leading up to  
 where the{Sunday School}meet. The     
 chancel contains a big colourful      
 window of Jesus at the last           
 supper. Separating the chancel from   
 the main church is a beautiful wooden 
 screen which has carved figures and   
 flowers.                              </content>
