		<content>   Bricks are used for the outside     
 walls and turbo blocks for the inside.
 Turbo blocks are very light and look  
 like grey Aero chocolate. The little  
 pockets of air make them good for     
 insulation. The bricklayer's mate     
 carries the bricks in a hod.          
   Downstairs inside walls are built of
 turbo blocks. Upstairs walls are built
 of wooden uprights and spaces between 
 are covered with plaster board. The   
 roof is built of triangular wooden    
 frames held together with beams.      
 Roofing felt is laid then battens.    
 Tiles are then laid on those battens. 
    The plaster board is fixed to walls
 with blobs of plaster, leaving a      
 narrow gap. This, with roof           
 insulation and double glazed windows, 
 aids in keeping the house insulated.
