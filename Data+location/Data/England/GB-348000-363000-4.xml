		<content>   The survey area is sparsely         
 populated except for the village of   
 Duddon. Apart from Duddon the houses  
 are mainly agricultural in origin,    
 although often renovated and adapted  
 for life in the 20th. century.        
                                       
   The village of Duddon has had       
 several housing developments in recent
 years.  An area of council housing    
 came first, followed by several       
 developments of small houses and      
 bungalows. There are no current plans 
 for any significant housing           
 development.
