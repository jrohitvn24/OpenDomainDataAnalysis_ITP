		<title>10   SHOPPING ON WOOSEHILL</title>
		<content> On Friday 28th June we interviewed the
 manager of{SAFEWAYS SUPERMARKET.}He is
 29,married with two sons,he moved from
 Warminster.He enjoys living on        
 Woosehill and finds it very           
 convenient.The store occupies a 30,000
 sq. foot site and sells a huge range  
 of goods:but there are no plans to    
 include toys or clothes,these are not 
 profitable lines.He would like to have
 a cafe but hasn't room,the store      
 employs 132 people.The car park(also  
 30,000 sq. feet)is soon to be twice as
 big because most cutomers shop by car 
 weekly.Shoplifting is a problem       
 commited by all age groups.He dislikes
 the office block built in front of the
 store but likes the doctors surgery   
 which brings people to use the        
 pharmacy department.                  
                                       
                                       </content>
