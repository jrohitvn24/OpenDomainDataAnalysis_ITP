		<title>20A Typical Monday at School</title>
		<content>  On a Monday morning I get to school  
 just before 9a.m as usual. The whistle
 goes and we go into school, hang up   
 our coats and bags, change our shoes &amp;
 go into the classroom. Our teacher    
 does the dinner register then we give 
 in our Â£2.25 dinner money and read    
 until it's time for P.E. which we do  
 on the field or in the hall. After PE 
 we go out to play for ten minutes.    
 When the whistle is blown we go into  
 school and do maths until dinner time.
 A typical dinner is ravioli, chips,   
 peas and carrots followed by treacle  
 pudding &amp; custard. Then we play out on
 the field if the weather is nice or on
 the playground until the whistle goes.
 During the afternoon we work on a     
 project such as 'Communications' with 
 a break of ten minutes in the middle. 
 We clear up the classroom before we go
 home at half past three.              </content>
