		<content> Upper Heyford Air Base has three      
 squadrons of aircraft stationed there,
 mainly F111 swing wing fighter bombers
 plus all the ancillary services e.g.  
 fire, medical and police services.    
                                       
 Being so dominated by the aircraft    
 causes several problems in the area.  
 The most noticeable of these is       
 aircraft noise. An announcement has   
 been made by the Ministry of Defence  
 that grants will be made available to 
 local residents to install sound      
 proofing in their homes. Planning is  
 sometimes refused for new building    
 which is likely to be badly affected  
 by noise.                             
                                       
 The number of airmen together with    
 their families far outnumber the local
 population  so stretching housing and 
 services to the limit.                </content>
