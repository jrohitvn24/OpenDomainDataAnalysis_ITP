		<content> wash ourselves. We came back and      
 went into our tents at 12 o'clock. We 
 had a feast. We had a nutty bar and   
 chocolate fingers. These were the     
 people who were in my tent. There was 
 Paul Lander, Steven Roberts, Jonathan 
 While, James McFarlane, David Jones   
 and me. We got to sleep at 2 o'clock  
 in the morning and woke up at 4       
 o'clock in the morning. We were       
 absolutely tired out the next day.
