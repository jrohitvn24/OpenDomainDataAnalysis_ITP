		<title>08A FARM IN STAINFORTH (2)</title>
		<content> Milking is done by machines, but they 
 still need to be fixed onto the udders
 by hand. When being milked the cows   
 stand above the farmer who is in a    
 sort of pit. From here he is able to  
 fit the machines onto the udders. The 
 milking parlour is joined to a cow    
 house and a silo. This is where the   
 cows are housed and fed in winter. One
 full-time farm hand (male) is employed
 by the farmer. He lives nearby.       
 Contractors are brought in to do the  
 siloing, with some part-time helpers  
 if necessary. All the family help on  
 the farm and work together. Their home
 life is a close one. The majority of  
 the house-work and meal preparation is
 done by the farmer's wife, and this is
 a very important part of keeping the  
 farm going. The two daughters are     
 expected to help, but the son is      
 encouraged to help his dad.           </content>
