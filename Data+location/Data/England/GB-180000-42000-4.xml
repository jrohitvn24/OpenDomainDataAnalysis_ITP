		<content> For the hard-up youth of the area the 
 amenities are insufficient and too    
 expensive. What they enjoy is Machine 
 Arcades, Cafes, Youth Clubs,Discos,   
 Clubs, Cinemas, Pool Halls, etc..     
 Although towns like Truro do not have 
 enough, outlying districts have even  
 less. A lack of amenities coupled with
 unemployment and underage drinking may
 contribute to increased vandalism     
 assisted by the presence of too few   
 police. Tourism is important to the   
 area for jobs and money but there is a
 general distrust of foreigners who    
 cause prices for local people to rise,
 leave rubbish everywhere and cause    
 traffic jams. Church is not well      
 attended by the young and opinion     
 is split concerning Nuclear war but   
 generally most accept the possibility,
 are resigned to it, and then choose to
 forget about it.                      </content>
