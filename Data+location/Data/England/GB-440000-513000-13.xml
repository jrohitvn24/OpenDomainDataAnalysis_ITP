		<title>13MRS.PUNTINS (continued)</title>
		<content>   Mrs. Puntins said that rationing was
 shocking and there was very little to 
 eat. The kitchen differs a great deal.
 Things are made easy by having        
 electric cookers and fast boiling     
 things and easy to clean things that  
 she didn't have when she was          
 young.When she was a little girl she  
 couldn't buy tins of food; you bought 
 everything fresh, so she was often    
 sent out for the groceries. Mrs.      
 Puntins prefers the old coinage       
 because she got more to the pound; she
 got 240 pennies then but now she only 
 gets 100. Nowadays Mrs.Puntins has to 
 have a special diet. She has to buy   
 meat, fish and anything with no fat   
 in it and brown bread. She bakes      
 her own cakes so she knows what she is
 eating. She intends to stay in the    
 same house now for the rest of her    
 life.                                 </content>
