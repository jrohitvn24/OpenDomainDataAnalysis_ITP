		<title>13Living In Keynsham In 1985</title>
		<content> far from the High Street.After school 
 I like going down to Manor Playing    
 Field which has swings,a slide and a  
 see-saw.The field is quite big_it has 
 goal posts so you can play football.  
 Also there is some horses near by so I
 like going up there and feeding them. 
{ In Keynsham there is plenty of things
 to do.I like dancing,swimming,and     
 Brownies.The swimming pool is heated  
 and has a great big floating dragon.  
 They have plenty of sports too like   
 tennis,gym,and karate.The dancing     
 class I go to is very good.Mrs Veale  
 teaches us flick kicks,step flicks,and
 many other steps.At Brownies you go   
 for walks,dance and sing.I also have  
 four pets,a cat called Twinkie and 3  
 guinea pigs.
