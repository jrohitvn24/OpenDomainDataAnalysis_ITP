		<title>16ADULT LEISURE PURSUITS</title>
		<content>  There are many facilities and outlets
 for leisure activities for adults.    
 One of the most recent trends has been
 towards jogging.  There are many 'fun-
 runs' organised that cover a distance 
 of between five and ten miles. Many   
 people young and old can do this      
 activity and it does not cost them    
 much money all they need is a pair of 
 'trainers'.                           
  As well as this many people play     
 football and cricket for 'works' teams
 at the weekend, and make use of their 
 company's facilities. The local sports
 complex is alo very popular with      
 adults as they can play squash,       
 swimand even do 'Pop- mobility' which 
 is exercise in a dance style.  There  
 has been a growth in such sporting    
 activities due to a greater interest  
 in personal health but also because   
 there is more 'leisure' time free.    </content>
