		<content> The A384 is the only main road which  
 borders the block on the north. Minor 
 roads connect Moortown and Plaster    
 Down, one road running through        
 Sampford Spiney. This forks just below
 the church, both branching out onto   
 the moor, joining a road leading      
 across open moorland into Tavistock.  
 Longash, Daveytown and Parktown are   
 linked by a bridlepath from the A384  
 at Merrivale. Vixen Tor Cottages,     
 Heckwood HOuse and Hecklake are       
 reached along a track which the       
 residents maintain themselves,        
 enabling them to reach Tavistock or   
 other built-up areas by way of        
 Sampford Spiney. Hence everyone relies
 upon the use of a motor vehicle for   
 contact with shops and entertainment. 
 The only car parks are small ones at  
 intervals on the A384 designated by   
 the Dartmoor National Park.           </content>
