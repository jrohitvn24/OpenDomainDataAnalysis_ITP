		<title>12TRAVELS FROM PETROCKSTOWE</title>
		<content>{52%}of the{Petrockstowe}adults have   
 travelled{abroad,}most of them in     
 Europe, which many have visited more  
 than once.  6% have been to North     
 Africa or the Middle East, 4% have    
 crossed the Atlantic to the USA or    
 Canada, and another 4% have been      
 further afield, including Malaya,     
 South Africa and India.  Half the     
 adults have travelled by ship, inclu- 
 ding cross Channel ferries, 39% by    
 'plane, and 5% have been in a heli-   
 copter. Most of this travel has been  
 for holidays, with a very small amount
 a result of work or Armed Forces      
 travel. A large proportion take       
 regular{annual holidays abroad,}and go
 to both London and Exeter more than   
 once a year. Only 44% visit Plymouth, 
 only 15% go to Bristol. 26% of the    
 adults have never been to London and  
 10% have not been to Exeter.          </content>
