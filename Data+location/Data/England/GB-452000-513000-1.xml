		<content> Our D block can be conveniently       
 divided into an area of suburban      
 housing covering the N.E. part of the 
 block and agricultural land covering  
 the rest (see 'land cover' survey).   
 The suburban area comprises the       
 villages of{Marton}and{Nunthorpe.}Both
 villages are of early origin. Marton  
 is also well known as the birthplace  
 of Captain James Cook. Little evidence
 is left of the past and most of the   
 housing is recent. The villages       
 serve as a dormitory area for nearby  
{Middlesbrough.}The area is crossed by 
 roads and a railway, and well served  
 by schools such as Captain Cook       
 Junior, Chandler's Ridge Primary, St  
 Bernadette's Primary and Nunthorpe    
 Primary - the schools contributing the
 following chapters. A big THANK-YOU to
 all the children and staff involved.
