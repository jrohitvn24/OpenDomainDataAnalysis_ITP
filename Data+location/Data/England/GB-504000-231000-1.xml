		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION.</title>
		<content>  The whole area covered by our twelve 
 kilometre squares is a rural one.Part 
 of Pulloxhill village with the school 
 and the church is included as also are
 the outskirts of Barton,Harlington and
 Sharpenhoe.The majority of the area is
 one of very large arable fields. The  
 two dominating crops are barley and   
 oil-seed rape.                        
  During the last twenty years several 
 farms have been amalgamated and the   
 people living in the farm houses have 
 no connection with farming. Many      
 hedges and trees have disappeared so  
 that fields may now be as much as 60  
 acres in size. Some farmers have      
 planted small copses of trees in      
 awkward corners of fields where the   
 large machinery cannot reach.         
  There are no main roads in the area  
 at all.                               
                                       </content>
