		<content> The compulsion by law for schooling   
 causes delinquency in a minority of   
 children,while others query the       
 validity of main stream schooling.In  
 old days such children were punished  
 by imprisonment,even transported,but  
 now they are cared for and educated in
 the best possible manner.Deighton     
 Close Special School was opened in    
 1967 for 56 boys who had difficulty   
 fitting into ordinary schools.The     
 Victorian house was bought by the     
 Lincolnshire County Council in 1964,  
 and adapted and added to between 1965 
 and 1975 with staff houses,boarding   
 houses and a large teaching block. It 
 stands in over 3 acres of parkland and
 woods on the border with Louth.The    
 skilful blending of old with the new  
 has resulted in a Civic Trust Award.
