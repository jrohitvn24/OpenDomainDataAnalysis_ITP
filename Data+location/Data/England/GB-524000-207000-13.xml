		<title>13TRADE _ The Forge</title>
		<content>{ The forge is at the top of Essendon  
 hill. It used to be about ten yards   
 down the road on the opposite side of 
 the road. Its been going for over 100 
 years. They used to shoe horses and   
 make farm machinery but the farmer now
 gets his machinery from factories and 
 the farrier shoes the horses. At the  
 forge they make railings, stairs and  
 gates and mend things. Their work is  
 very dangerous from all the sparks and
 sharp metal. They dont need protective
 clothing except for eye protectors and
 hard tough shoes. The blacksmith needs
 five years training. The forge has a  
 guillotine that can cut metal 6mm     
 thick. There were some rollers to     
 curve the metal and a bending machine 
 to make angles. There are six workers 
 and two in the office. None live in   
 the village and they work from 8am to 
 6.30pm.Some work is sent abroad.      </content>
