		<title>01THE VILLAGE OF GRETTON</title>
		<content>The village of Gretton is situated on a
hill overlooking the beautiful Welland 
Valley.  Old stone houses line the main
street, giving way to council houses   
and a private estate on the outer      
perimeter.  Four shops serve the people
- a Post Office cum general store, a   
newsagent's, a Co-operative store and a
hairdresser's.  St. James's Church is  
the oldest building in the village.    
There is a village hall which is the   
meeting place of many social groups,   
also of a playgroup for children under 
school age.  Gretton Primary School    
provides a good education for children 
up to 11 years old.  There are three   
public houses where the local people   
can meet for a drink and to play bar   
games.  A craft workshop offers tuition
in spinning and weaving, whilst a local
factory employs several village people.
