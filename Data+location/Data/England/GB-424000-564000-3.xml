		<content>    The{Newcastle Inner City Motorway} 
 was completed in 1975 after 13 years  
 of objections. The{Â£20M per mile}was  
 much higher than estimated due to     
 large compensation payments.          
    The original plan for West and East
 encircling arms round the CBD and an  
 additional Tyne bridge was scrapped.  
 Instead the{East Central}arm runs from
 the Tyne Bridge, touching the one-way 
 city centre network at key points and 
 linking out on new surface to the{A69,
{A1}and the eastward dual carriageway  
{'Coast Road', A1058.}                 
   {Tz land loss}was reduced by putting
 the N-bound deck over the S-bound, by 
 shaving parks and by using redundant  
 railway yards.                        
    It works as a{by-pass,}better still
 for centre access including{emergency 
 services.  The{bridge is a commuter   
{bottleneck.}                          </content>
