		<title>17A WOOD IN GREAT BROMLEY</title>
		<content>   There are several small woods in    
 the area.Typical of these is{Boudge   
{Hill Wood.}Ground cover is so thick   
 it is often impenetrable, comprising  
 thorns,nettles,thistles and brambles. 
{Trees}are mostly{oak, ash, silver     
{birch, larch, spruce and pine}with    
{poplars}ringing the wood. The conifers
 appear to have been planted but the   
 deciduous trees are for the most part 
 naturalised. The wood has two distinct
 characteristics; the western end is   
 much older with many silver birches   
 and old oaks; the eastern end is      
 mostly firs, ash, and younger oaks.   
{ }The{wood}is used for{game}and is not
 public,{pheasants}being reared in one 
 corner. The wood provides cover for   
{rabbits, magpies and wood-pigeons.}It 
 is close to the new Elmstead by-pass  
 road and when this was built an       
{underpass was provided for badgers.}  </content>
