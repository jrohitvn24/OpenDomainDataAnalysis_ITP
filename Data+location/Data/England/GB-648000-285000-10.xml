		<title>10FARMING</title>
		<content> Most of the farms have many buildings 
 11-20 including the farmhouse. The    
 houses tend to be old most dating from
 land enclosures in the 18th C. The    
 Henstead Estate was sub-divided and   
 sold to the tenant farmers after World
 War 2. Fields tend to be large and    
 most have hedgerows. Copses are used  
 for rearing game birds. Acreages vary 
 from approx 350-700, making for large 
 farms given over mainly to arable.    
 Soils are mixed, ranging from light   
 sandy loams to heavy boulder clays,   
 the result of glacial drift. In the   
 river valley are peaty soils          
 waterlogged in winter. There are on   
 average 4 men per farm. Farming is    
 capital intensive making much use of  
 machinery and all the farms have      
 workshops. Wheat is the predominant   
 crop, while recent changes include the
 phasing out of peas &amp; increase in rape</content>
