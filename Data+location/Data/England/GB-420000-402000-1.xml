		<content> Our area consists of a small valley   
 and its surrounding hillsides in the  
 Pennine hills.  The valley is occupied
 by the River Don, a railway (now      
 disused) and a main road linking      
 Barnsley with Manchester and parts of 
 Cheshire. The river rises a few miles 
 away to the west on the moors above   
 Winscar reservoir, near Dunford       
 Bridge, and then flows East. It flows 
 through Doncaster, to which it gives  
 its name, and eventually joins the    
 River Humber. In the narrow valley are
 the township of Thurlstone, and       
 westwards, the village of Millhouse   
 Green. They are situated just outside 
 the small market town of Penistone.   
 Both settlements come within the      
 Barnsley council area.  Although      
 Barnsley is only 9 miles away, and    
 Sheffield 13 miles, this area is      
 rural and of great beauty and historic</content>
