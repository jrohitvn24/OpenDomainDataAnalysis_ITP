		<content>VILLAGE FACILITIES                     
The village playing fields, with their 
modern brick built pavilion are home of
the football team and the cricket team.
Sadly the majority of the players for  
each of the teams is drawn from outside
the village.                           
                                       
PRIVATE FACILITIES                     
Within the grounds of East Haddon Hall 
is a private squash club and also a    
small swimming pool. A number of       
villagers use the courts together with 
many more people from Northampton.     
                                       
Many children are taken by parents to  
either Northampton or Daventry for     
swimming and gymnastic clubs. Mini     
rugby is available in nearby Long      
Buckby.
