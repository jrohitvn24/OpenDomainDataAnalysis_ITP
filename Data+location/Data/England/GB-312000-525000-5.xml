		<title>05ATTITUDES IN LORTON</title>
		<content> The Planning Board is often critised  
 for the inconsistency of its          
 decisions. Dissatisfaction is felt    
 because members appointed to the Board
 by the County Council for their       
 political views are men who do not    
 live in the National Park and do not  
 represent the residents. The          
 unspoiledness is jealously guarded by 
 articulate residents. A proposal to   
 make Lorton Hall an outdoor pursuits  
 centre was refused planning permission
 after public protest. Some people     
 dislike the Caravan Club rallies and  
 the Girl Guide camp. A folk festival  
 was not repeated after protests. Low  
 flying military aircraft cause sudden,
 frightening noise which is mostly     
 tolerated as a necessary evil. Farm   
 animals have become used to it. The   
 nearness of the Atomic Power Plant at 
 Sellafield disturbs only a minority.  </content>
