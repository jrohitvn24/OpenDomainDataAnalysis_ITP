		<title>12The Common,Bayston Hill.</title>
		<content>   In the middle of the oldest part of 
 Bayston Hill,East of the A49,is       
 The Common.It is a big round piece    
 of ground which everybody can play    
 on and there are grazing rights which 
 means you can graze sheep or any thing
 on it.                                
     There was a very old ram on the   
 Common.Everyone knew him.He was big,  
 fat,and his name was Starsky.Mr.      
 Edwards who owned the ram used to tie 
 Starsky to a stake on the Common so   
 people could come and stroke him. You 
 could see where he had eaten the grass
 from around him because he could      
 hardly stand up. He wasn't very well  
 because of all the weight he was      
 carrying about with him.I used to go  
 up every night and see him but one    
 time I went up Mr. Edwards told me    
 that Starsky had gone blind and had   
 died of old age.                      </content>
