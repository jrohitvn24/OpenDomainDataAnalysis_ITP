Hadleigh May Show is an agricultural   
show held on the last Saturday in May  
in Holbecks Park. It attracts many     
people from Hadleigh and the           
surrounding districts. All the shops in
Hadleigh have a stall and there are    
many trade stands and some clubs have  
stalls as well.Local schools enter an  
Art competition. One end of the field  
is used for farm animals.              
Usually the Hadleigh Fire Engine stands
at the entrance and little children are
allowed on it. There is also a fair    
which goes on into the evening.        
All through the day there are events   
going on in the Ring.
