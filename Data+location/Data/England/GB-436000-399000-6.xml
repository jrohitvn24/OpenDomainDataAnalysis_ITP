		<content> On the 1st May I went with some of    
 my class to the job centre to find out
 what the employment situation was like
 in Hoyland. Three people work there   
 and they have to have 5 'O' levels.   
 The main work in Hoyland is in making 
 clothing, engineering, bars, catering,
 cleaning and building. The most       
 popular jobs are driving and building 
 and the least popular labouring and   
 cleaning.17% of the people are        
 unemployed. People come from Wombwell 
 and Barnsley to get jobs but people   
 are not leaving the area to take up   
 jobs. Most of the jobs being offered  
 now are part_time and temporary in    
 pubs and sewing factories. The highest
 paid job is a computer tutor at Â£131  
 per week. The strangest job is for a  
 kissogram girl. In the last week in   
 April 312 people used the job centre.
