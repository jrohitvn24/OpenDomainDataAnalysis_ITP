		<title>14The Eel Trap, Alrewas</title>
		<content>There is only one item from the        
original Domesday Book that is still in
existance.  It is written that Alrewas 
was retained for the King because of   
the eel trap.  It yielded 1,000 eels   
per annum.  The mill has owned the trap
since 1614 when it was repaired.  The  
flood gates across the river (now      
removed) controlled the flow of water  
to the mill.  The trap was reached     
across the top of the gates.  The eels 
were caught in the shallows whilst sun-
ning themselves.  The river was        
diverted in the 1970's and no longer   
flows through the trap.  Some original 
stonework remains, but most of the     
structure is later brick.  The tunnel  
is 8ft 7ins wide and 10 ft long. There 
is a small opening with a gate at one  
end.  The other end is open.
