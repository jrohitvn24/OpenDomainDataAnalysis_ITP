		<title>12Anna Valley Trout Farm.</title>
		<content>     Anna Valley Trout farm is situated
 on the Salisbury Road next to the     
 Andover Garden Centre. The farm was   
 started in 1981 and has now grown to  
 have a large turnover of fish.        
     The fish are kept outside in long 
 tanks with a constant running water   
 supply. The trout are fed five times a
 day on special fish pellets. The fish 
 are reared from eggs that are bought  
 from all over the world. The baby     
 trout are called 'fingerlings'.       
     On average 200 trout a day are    
 sold to the public. There is a shop on
 the site which sells the fish and also
 pate made from the fish.
