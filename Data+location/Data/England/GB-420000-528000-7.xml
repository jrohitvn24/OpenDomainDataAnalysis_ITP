		<title>07THE SCHOOL DAY</title>
		<content> My name is Daniel Humble. I live in a 
 semi-detached house in Bishop         
 Auckland. These are the events of a   
 typical Tuesday.                      
 I get up at 8.00am and get dressed. I 
 go down for my breakfast which is     
 usually Cornflakes. Then I go upstairs
 and get ready for school. I travel to 
 school in the car and leave home at   
 8.45am. At 9.30am Andrew, James and I 
 have clarinet lessons. At 10.00am we  
 go back to the class for mental       
 arithmetic. At playtime we go to      
 Woodhouse Close school for a swimming 
 lesson. They have a small learner pool
 which our class uses once a fortnight.
 We have our lunch in the school hall. 
 In the afternoon we have P.E then     
 science. When I get home I have my tea
 and then I go to my grandmas with my  
 mam.
