   This mansion, set in its own        
 grounds, with numerous outbuildings,  
 was built in the 1870's after the     
 demolition of an earlier mansion in   
 1875.  It was used as a residence of  
 the Abel-Smith family until 1922,     
 whereupon it was bought by the        
 Dr.Barnardo organisation becoming the 
 William Baker Technical School for    
 Orphaned Boys.  It continued as such  
 until the 1960's when it was acquired 
 by Herts.County Council.  It now      
 houses the County Highways Department 
 and part of the Education Department. 
 There is  a T.V studio where courses  
 are run for teachers &amp; children; an   
 Art Store which loans out paintings to
 schools &amp; a musical instrument repair 
 workshop.  The grounds contain various
 sports pitches, some for public use.
