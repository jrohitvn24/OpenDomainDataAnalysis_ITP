		<title>11Home Life in Malhamdale</title>
		<content> Almost every household in the block   
 owns a freezer from necessity,since   
 there are no food shops in Malhamdale 
 and food must be bought in            
 Skipton,Settle or Gargrave,which      
 sometimes proves difficult during     
 periods of bad weather.               
 Almost every household owns at least  
 one cat and one dog since many        
 houses are isolated,although the crime
 rate is very low.                     
 Most houses are heated by solid fuel  
 and have open fires.There is no gas   
 supply nearby.Many farmhouses are also
 partially heated by the agas which    
 they have in the kitchens.            
 The divorce rate in the dale is almost
 non-existent,as are the known cases of
 child abuse.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
