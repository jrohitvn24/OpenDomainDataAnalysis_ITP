		<content> The original Denton (Town in the hole)
 was in the valley by the church, built
 C12. After the Great Plaque in C17    
 villagers moved up the hill. Family   
 farmhouses were built about 1650 with 
 a few fields enclosing stock. The     
{Chapel}was built 1655 by Thomas Lawson
 and was the Mother church for the     
 area. The present Chapel was rebuilt  
 in 1821 following a fire.             
 The late Saxon Motte &amp; Bailey{Castle} 
 is on Castle Hill, next to Hangmans   
 Hill. Many finds of pottery etc. here.
 Local names are taken from History.

 woman in blue drowned, her headless
