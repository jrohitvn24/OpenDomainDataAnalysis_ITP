		<content> This block covers part of a rural area
 much of which is low lying and is     
 Known as The Weald Moors,and includes 
 the village of Kynnersley in North    
 Shropshire.                           
  The area is mainly                   
 agricultural,arable farming           
 predominating.                        
  There no major manufacturing         
 industries within the area.           
  There are few public facilities,the  
 nearest being Wellington,Telford or   
 Newport.                              
  There are no major roads within the  
 area and few public transport         
 services.                             
  Settlements tend to be small,often   
 little more than hamlets and are often
 nucleated.
