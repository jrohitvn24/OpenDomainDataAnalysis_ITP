		<content>In the south-west of our area the land 
is almost entirely agricultural. It    
is intensely farmed in fields of       
approximately 20 hectares.  It is flat 
and productive land which can be seen  
from the fact that it is used for crops
which require the most fertile soil:   
oil-seed rape, winter wheat and sugar  
beet.  This would be categorised as    
Grade 1 agricultural land. The owner   
of Grange Farm (670 acres) has lived   
there all his life and employs 4       
people to work with the dairy herd     
and the growing crops.  Peas are       
grown for processing in Lowestoft      
factories.  Towards the east, by the   
edge of the cliff is an area of wet    
grassland and some fields of wheat. In 
square 52 89 much of the land which    
was used for {agriculture} has been    
developed as an industrial estate.
