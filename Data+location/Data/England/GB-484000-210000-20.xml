		<content>    Bedgrove being a small place does  
not have much varying landscape and    
wildlife,but what it has is very       
interesting.There is a pond which has  
two mallard ducks on it.Also we have a 
spinney where squirrels and other      
creatures dwell.                       
    In Halton there is the canal.Many  
birds nest there such as a pair of mute
swans,coots,moorhens,and mallard       
ducks. Being in the country means      
having rabbits,foxes and hedgehogs.    
    Owls,kestrels,sparrowhawks,and     
woodpeckers are common visitors in our 
area.
