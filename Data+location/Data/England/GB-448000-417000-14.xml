		<content>      Between Darrington and Stapleton 
 there is a crop sraying unit and a    
 chemical supply depot,where farmers   
 are able to buy the chemicals they    
 need if they wish to carry out the    
 spraying themselves.                  
     The crop spraying machines are    
 used over a radius of about seventy   
 miles, from Scarborough to South      
 Nottinghamshire. They work on         
 contract.                             
    Much of the spraying is of a       
 certain kind of fertilizer, but they  
 also spray herbicides and pesticides. 
    Although Stapleton Park prefer to  
 use tractor-drawn spraying equipment, 
 this is not really possible when the  
 peas have reached a certain height. In
 this case a helicoptor is used. We saw
 it spraying against aphids on the     
 peas.                                 
    A light plane is also used locally.</content>
