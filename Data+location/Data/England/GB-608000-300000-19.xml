		<title>19TOWN PLAN</title>
		<content>   In 1985 the{Wymondham Town 10 year  
{Plan}was published, amid objections.  
  Chapel Lane residents objected to    
 buildings opposite their homes because
 it would spoil the view of the valley.
  Pedestrianisation was suggested      
 because so many lorries came through  
 the town centre. The shopkeepers      
 thought it would take away trade.     
  The proposals suggested moving a     
 bowling green to Kings Head Meadow and
 the use of the vacated space for      
 car_parking.The local bowls club and  
 football team objected to that.       
  The S.N.D.C. wanted to put a large   
 estate on Harts Farm. The W.T.C. said 
 it should be in small patches to avoid
 social problems.                      
  Local people are against moving      
 Browick Road recreation ground to     
 Tuttles Lane because the site is away 
 from the town centre and too wet.{    </content>
