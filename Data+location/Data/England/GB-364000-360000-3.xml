		<content> They are now painted black and white. 
 Wades Green Farm, however, has been   
 restored to natural timber and brick  
 infill. There are other{manor houses }
 of this period in the area. The next  
 wave of building, in the early 18th   
 century used local{field made bricks.}
 These bricks are not very resistant to
 weathering and several of the build-  
 ings have been rendered(the Vicarage, 
 the Badger,Bridge and Woodside        
 Cottages). Some( Bridge House,Village 
 Farm) have been built round the frame 
 work of an earlier cottage.The church 
 (1702)is not a beautiful building,but 
 the inside is friendly and welcoming, 
 with an attractive colour scheme of   
 blue,white and gold,recently repainted
 by YTS workers. The school and many of
 the farmhouses are Victorian,the      
 former now redundant and the latter   
 too large for times without servants. </content>
