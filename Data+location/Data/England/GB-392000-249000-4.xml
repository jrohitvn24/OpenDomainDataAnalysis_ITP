		<content> After asking the children of today, we
 conducted a survey of the older       
 members of our community to find out  
 how they spent school breaktimes.     
    The most popular games were        
 hopscotch, what's the time Mr Wolf?,  
 tig-tag, skipping, marbles, and whip  
 and top.                              
    Apart from whip and top, all of    
 these games are still played          
 periodically by children today in     
 this area. Such games tend to come as 
 crazes probably triggered off by one  
 child talking to his or her           
 grand-parents about the games they    
 used to play.                         
    Teachers do not usually encourage  
 hopscotch unless there is a marked    
 pitch on the playground because       
 children make a mess on the ground    
 with chalk.
