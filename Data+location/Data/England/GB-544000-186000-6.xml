  {My Bedroom}is always untidy and I   
 hate tidying it up. My bedroom has a  
 long white{wardrobe}in which I put my 
 clothes. I have a{cupboard}with a set 
 of drawers where I keep my{toys}and   
 the things that I cannot hang up. In  
 my bedroom I have a{bed}that folds    
 into a sofa for two. I have got a pink
 carpet and a brown bed. At the side,  
 on a wall I have got a{Sindy House    
 with two dolls in it. I do a lot of   
 moving about with the things in the   
 rooms. I like to read{books}and I have
 a lot of them. I spend a lot of time  
 in my bedroom.
