		<title>10Horses and Riding 2</title>
		<content>  With all the interest in horses,     
{riding centres}are a popular feature. 
{The Shirley Holms Activity Centre}    
 which comprises of a country house    
 with{150 acres}of land has direct     
 access on to the New Forest. It caters
 for all kinds of riding, jumping and  
 cross country, carriage drives,       
 swimming and educational farm visits. 
 However, at the time of our survey    
 (June 1985),it was in the process     
 of being sold. We were told it would  
 be re-opening under new management.   
{ East Street Riding Stables}in Pitmore
 Lane opened in 1983. They have 12     
 stables and 30 horses and 1 stable in 
 which to keep grain. They keep 2 cats 
 to protect the feed from rats &amp; mice. 
 They own{1\ acres}of land but are able
 to use other fields for grazing. Only 
 a few horses are kept in the stable as
 most are hardy enough to stay outside.</content>
