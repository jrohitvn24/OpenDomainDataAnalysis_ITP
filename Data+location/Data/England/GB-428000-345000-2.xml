		<title>02Buildings around Turnditch</title>
		<content>      The  majority of local  buildings
 are of red brick  although  there  are
 some  notable  exceptions.  There  are
 many buildings dating back at least in
 part for over 400 years. Of particular
 interest is the{Thatched Cottage}which
 is comparatively modern  but  contains
 beams obtained  from  the  Old Dolphin
 Inn in  Derby  when  part  of  it  was
 demolished  for a road widening scheme
 in the l930s.                         
      The  {Flower Lilies }in   Windley
 takes its name from  medieval times.It
 is  a  large  building   which  is  at
 present divided into flats.           
      Many  of  our  older  buildings ,
 including  {Turnditch  Hall ,    }were
 constructed  from  bricks  made in the
 now obsolete  brick kilns  to be found
 at the end of Lime Kiln Lane.
