		<content> I rise early, usually at about six.   
 After getting my husband and daughter 
 off to work I see to my own breakfast,
 then wash up and do some housework. By
 eleven I am ready to go out and I may 
 do some shopping then; by twelve I    
 must be at school, where I am a lunch_
 time supervisor. I enjoy this, though 
 it is no easy job.                    
                                       
 Part of the afternoon is my leisure   
 time. I may spend it in the garden, or
 with a book or the television; or I   
 may get on with more housework. Then I
 must get ready for my family's return.
 I like to have their meal ready, and  
 to hear about their day. After that I 
 may see more television, or I may be  
 busy on household jobs till bed-time, 
 which is often at about 10 o'clock.   
                                       
                                       </content>
