		<title>16GOOSTREY VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content> The Village Hall building is shared   
 with the Infant department of the     
 local school. The teaching areas are  
 not used by the public but the rest of
 the building - hall,lounge,stage and  
 dressing rooms - is available for use 
 by the school and the community.      
 Several clubs hold their meetings in  
 the village hall.                     
                                       
 Last week a day centre was set up.    
 This is intended as a meeting place   
 for lonely or housebound people.      
 Volunteers collect the members and    
 assist with running the activities.   
 It is hoped to establish close links  
 with the school. Already the junior   
 children have helped to choose a name 
 for the centre, made suggestions for  
 activities (including French cricket!)
 and entertained the members with a    
 performance of Pinnochio.             </content>
