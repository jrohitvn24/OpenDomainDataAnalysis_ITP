		<content> "Festival 700" celebrating the seventh
 centenary of the church's foundation  
 has been held this year with a variety
 of festivals and social events.  This 
 church is very closely involved in the
 community through the play scheme,    
 women's institute, youth and senior   
 citizen's clubs.                      
 Listed in the Domesday Book the church
 of "Badechitone" it retains its       
 original character with additions and 
 restoration work in keeping with a    
 medieval church.  Only the electric   
 lighting seems incongruous.  The spire
 repaired in 1982 has stone taken from 
 Baginton castle. Some rebuilding      
 during the 1930's and '40's was       
 necessitated by the ravages of wartime
 bombing. Like many parish churches the
 vicar is shared with nearby villages  
 holding regular Thursday and Sunday   
 services.                             </content>
