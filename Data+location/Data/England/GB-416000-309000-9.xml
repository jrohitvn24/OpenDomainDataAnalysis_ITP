The village shop is a very important   
part of our village.The older members  
of the village rely on it for their    
groceries.The shop has a post office.It
sells groceries,sweets,ice lollies and 
ice cream,stationary,batteries,small   
torches,cooked meats,cream,milk,cheese,
butter,cigarettes,matches,wines and    
spirits and a lot more.Mr.John Ottiwell
is the owner of the shop and he has    
made it the best village shop we have  
had for years.My family uses it alot.  
The shop is situated at the bottom of  
The Square.Late night openings are     
Tuesday and Friday and early closing   
days are Wednesday and Sunday.The      
things are very reasonably priced.I    
think it is a very good shop.
