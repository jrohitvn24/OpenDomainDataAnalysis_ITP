		<title>07Teenager in Baston interview</title>
		<content> We interviewed a boy of 16 who has    
 lived in the same house in the village
 for the last 12 years. Five people    
 live there including a merchandizer   
 and engineer, and 2 other children.   
 During the 12 years{village life}has  
 not changed,much to his disgust. He   
 does not like living there and he     
 finds the other{teenagers}uncongenial.
 He does not like the company in the   
 public houses. The{bus service}to     
 Peterborough is not too bad but he    
 feels a car is an essential. He shops 
 occasionaly in the village shop, of   
 which he approves. He finds that most 
 of the villagers are friendly to      
 newcomers, but about a quarter keep   
 themselves to themselves. As there is 
 nothing for his age group to do in the
 village he finds it boring and cannot 
 wait to leave.                        
                                       </content>
