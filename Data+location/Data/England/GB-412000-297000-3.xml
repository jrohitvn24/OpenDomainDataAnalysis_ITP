		<content>The maintenance of law and order is a  
social concern. Middle-aged and older  
residents are very anxious that        
elements of teenagers are making a     
nuisance of themselves on the streets  
and in the shopping areas in a manner  
which is aggressive and hostile towards
ordinary residents. This may partly be 
an attitude of the older generation    
towards the younger but is also an     
acknowledgement that people do not feel
as Â£safe' in the 1980's because crime  
is on the increase.                    
Numbers of burglaries have increased   
andoffences associated with motoring   
are commonplace. Sutton Coldfield      
police station recorded the driver with
the highest alcoholic intake in the    
whole of Birmingham. The ready         
availability of alcohol is abused by   
teenagers. People want more policemen.
