		<title>13Education in Kinver</title>
		<content>     Local children start school at    
Foley Infants which is at the foot of  
Kinver Edge. At age 8 they go to       
Brindley Heath Junior School. Both     
these schools are in new buildings.    
     Part of Edgecliff Comprehensive   
School was built in the 1960s but the  
Old Block was built before the war. It 
has open corridors and is very cold and
draughty in winter. However all the    
schools have excellent facilities.     
     Brindley and Edgecliff share      
the same site with extensive playing   
fields. Pupils come to Edgecliff not   
just from Kinver but from villages     
several miles to the north outside     
this block. There are about 700 pupils 
in the school including 80 in the      
Sixth Form.
