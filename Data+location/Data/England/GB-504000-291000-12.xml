		<content>                                       
We eat  a mixture  of vegetables, meat,
fruit, dairy  and cereal products.     
We  eat different parts of {vegetables}
We sometimes eat the  leaves, roots  or
flowers and seeds.     The most popular
vegetable is {potatoes} because you can
have them in all sorts of ways. We like
carrots because they are good for us.  
Some {meat} which we eat are pork which
comes from pigs, beef which comes  from
cattle and lamb which comes from sheep.
Most of  our {dairy products} come from
cows.    We consume milk, cream, cheese
and butter.                            
{Cereal Products}  include  Cornflakes,
Weetabix, porridge and muesli.         
Cereal  products  are  made from grains
like corn, barley and  wheat.
