		<content>{ECONOMICS.}Nowadays very few people   
 are paid in cash.Most people have     
 cheque books and credit cards.To use a
 cheque you must have a bankers card to
 support it.Credit cards like Access   
 and Visa allow you to buy goods and   
 pay later.The Post Office pays out    
 Pensions and Allowances.You can have  
 a Savings Account and also use the    
 Giro like a bank.Many people including
 children use banks for saving money.  
 You put money into an Investment      
 Account and get paid Interest on that 
 money.There are two Banks in          
 Coggeshall,Barclays and Natwest.They  
 also lend people money.To buy your own
 house you have to borrow money.People 
 either get a bank loan or a mortgage  
 from a Building Society.There are only
 sub-branches of Building Societies in 
 other peoples offices.
