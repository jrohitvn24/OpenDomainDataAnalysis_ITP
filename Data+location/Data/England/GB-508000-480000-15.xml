		<title>15Employment in Filey.</title>
		<content> On July the 17th we sent a small      
 questionaire to the children of Filey 
 Junior School.We asked about the      
 occupations ofthe people in their     
 families, where they worked and what  
 sort of jobs they did. A total of     
 300 people were involved. 58% worked  
 in our block and 42% work outside our 
 block.                                
   We then looked at the people who    
 worked in our block and tried to find 
 the main occupations. 32% were        
 involved in tourism.We included pubs, 
 hotels and cafes under this heading.  
 16% had jobs connected with the       
 fishing industry,either on the sea or 
 one of the back-up jobs ashore. 22%   
 had jobs in shops of one kind or      
 another. Of the rest the only major   
 employer was Dale Electric in which 4%
 of those surveyed were employed.
