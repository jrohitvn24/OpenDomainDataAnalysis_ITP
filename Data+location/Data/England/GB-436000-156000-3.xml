		<title>03ECOLOGY OF LINKENHOLT</title>
		<content> Linkenholt is a typical chalk downland
 village; the soil being loam and clay 
 on chalk. Arable crops grown are wheat
 and barley. Sheep are kept but no     
 other livestock. Pheasants are reared 
 for shooting, the shoots              
 organised by a syndicate that pays the
 estate. One keeper is employed.       
 Deer are to be seen in the woods near 
 the village. A Barn Owl nested near   
 farm buildings this year. Bats live in
 the church and woodpeckers are often  
 to be seen on the church roof, and    
 have caused damage to the wooden tiles
 on the bell turret in the past.       
 There                                 
 are many footpaths and green lanes    
 crossing the land. The wet weather in 
 the summer in 1985 produced a wet and 
 expensive harvest.
