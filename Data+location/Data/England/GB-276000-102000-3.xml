		<title>03LEGENDS OF THE CROSS</title>
		<content>     There are many legends associated 
 with Copplestone Cross.  It does after
 all commemorate the murder of a       
 Bishop.  The main legend says that a  
 curse will fall on anyone who moves   
 the stone, and they will shortly die. 
 When it was decided the cross must be 
 moved because it was a danger to      
 traffic, many workmen refused to touch
 it.  When it was eventually excavated,
 several lucky charms were found buried
 underneath, and these were replaced   
 under the stone in its new position.  
 However, the locals will tell you that
 of all the men involved in working to 
 move it, nearly all suffered a        
 dreadful fate in the following months,
 and the man who took the decision to  
 move it became ill within days, and   
 died a week later.
