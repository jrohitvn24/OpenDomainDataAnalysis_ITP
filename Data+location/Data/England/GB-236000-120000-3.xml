		<title>03A TYPICAL FARM</title>
		<content>  The North Devon farms tend to        
 concentrate on milk  production as a  
 general rule. The farms usually have  
 between fifty and a hundred friesan   
 cows. Many of the farmers also keep   
 some sheep and all grow grass for     
 silage and hay. Some also grow some   
 grain crops for feed ,the straw being 
 used for winter bedding. A few farmers
 have started growing fodder beet to   
 supplement winter feeding.            
   The milk produced goes to the       
 creamery in Torrington where it is    
 made into butter and cheese. Mr       
 Pickard sells some of Mr. Lang's milk 
 direct to the people of Parkham. The  
 farmers use the local markets at      
 Holsworthy and Bideford to sell and   
 buy their stock though some is sent   
 direct to the abattoir at Torrington.
