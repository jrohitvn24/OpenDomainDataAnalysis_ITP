		<content> Newton-on-Ouse has a very good playing
 field where football and cricket      
 matches are played.Team members are   
 drawn from Linton-on-Ouse,            
 Newton-on-Ouse and the surrounding    
 area.Children's recreational equipment
 is sited on the Playing Field and on  
 several playing spaces on the housing 
 areas of R.A.F. Linton-on-Ouse.       
   Fishing is very popular on the River
 Ouse and the Kyle,which flows into the
 Ouse.Barbel,roach,dace,trout,perch,eel
 and pike are caught.Salmon travel up  
 the river to spawn.Fishing rites are  
 privately owned and tickets are needed
 to fish these waters.                 
   People from the two villages meet in
 Newton Parish Hall to play bowls.     
   Every house has its own garden,with 
 flower beds,vegetable plots and lawns;
 the whirr of the lawn mower is a      
 familiar sound on summer evenings.    </content>
