		<title>16Strensham Court Estate</title>
		<content> The estate of Strensham Court now     
 exist's mainly as a piece of natural  
 wood. The ground covers an area of    
 approx 15 acres. There are a large    
 number of trees yew, holly, sycamore, 
 horse water and sweet chestnut. The   
 remains of the old house are still to 
 be seen. The stable block is about to 
 be rebuilt to make twelve dwellings in
 the style of a mews. These buildings  
 are listed as grade two.              
   The plants and animals that are to  
 be found are varied and some are quite
 rare. There is a very active badger   
 set, lots of foxes and rabbits, the   
 bird population is also very prolific 
 ranging from birds of prey, owls      
 and wood peckers, nightingales, jays, 
 to the more common birds. Views of a  
 large man made lake, used for Otter   
 hunting, now lie on private land. An  
 ice house still remains from the past.</content>
