		<title>12STOCKLAND SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Stockland School is beautifully set in
 the heart of tha Devon countryside.   
 It was originally built in 1859,by the
 church.It is a Voluntary Controlled   
 School for Primary children aged      
 between 5 and 11.At present there are 
 86 on roll,divided into four classes. 
 It still maintains firm links with the
 church situated nearby.The pupils come
 from a large catchment area,which     
 includes Yarcombe,Marsh,Buckland St.  
 Mary as well as Stockland.In July 1965
 the local school at Yarcombe was      
 closed and now children are bussed    
 daily from here.The site enjoys a     
 large field,gardens used for          
 environmental education,a pond,and a  
 swimming-pool.IT is well supported by 
 an active P.T.F.A.&lt;Parents Teachers   
 Friends Association>.
