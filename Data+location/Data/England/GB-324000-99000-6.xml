		<content> There are 9000 W.I's in England and   
 Wales. Dalwood's W.I has 40           
 members.You have to be 16 years old to
 join the Dalwood W.I and it costs Â£4 a
 year.The meetings are held every first
 Wednesday of each month except August.
 The meeting always starts with the    
 minutes which tells the people who    
 weren't at the last meeting what      
 happened in the last meeting.They     
 also have a speaker to tell them      
 different and interesting things.The  
 Dalwood W.I has its own market at     
 which they sell home made cakes,      
 fruit,hand made toys and other things.
 They have a Christmas bazaar to raise 
 money for charity.                    
   When the village school was         
 threatened with closure several years 
 ago, the W.I started a playgroup to   
 support the school.
