		<content> I am retired now. I get up and do my  
 housework. After that I do some       
 gardening if it is fine. Sometimes I  
 go to play golf at Marlborough Golf   
 Club. If it's wet, I do some knitting 
 or some jobs indoors.                 
 At lunchtime I listen to the Archers  
 on the radio, before doing some       
 cooking. Sometimes I go into          
 Marlborough to help in the Oxfam shop 
 and do a bit of shopping.             
 In the evening after dinner I usually 
 do the Daily Telegraph crossword      
 puzzle and watch television for a     
 while, if there is anything           
 interesting.                          
 Then I go to bed. I read a chapter of 
 my library book before I go to        
 sleep. I get my books from the mobile 
 library van which comes round the     
 villages every two weeks.
