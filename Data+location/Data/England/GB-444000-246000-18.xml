		<content> Banbury market is our nearest market. 
It is the biggest cattle market in     
Europe and it is busy every weekday.   
We also have a general  market on      
Thursday and Saturday.                 
 Farmers go to market to buy and sell  
things.They sell them in areas known as
rings.The men stand outside of the     
rings and bid for the animals that     
enter the ring.When animals get to the 
market they are all given a number, and
put in a pen. There are different pens 
different types of animals:- the       
milking cows are all put in one pen.   
You can take any type of farm animal to
market.The farmers get their animals to
market in a lorry or cow box.When they 
get to market they drive into a loading
bay to unload the animals. Sometimes   
the animals stay overnight in sheds.   
They also have fields to put big herds 
in.                                    </content>
