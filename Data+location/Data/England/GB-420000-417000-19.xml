		<content> In the community at large there are   
 many talented people.These people have
 often developed in artistic ways      
 following on from many hours spent at 
 evening classes doing such things as  
 painting,pottery,embroidery,weaving &amp; 
 flower decoration.The skills often    
 only come to light if one visits the  
 home,an exhibition of paintings or    
 other crafts at a church or evening   
 school.                               
    {  MIRFIELD ARTS CENTRE}           
 The Centre has recently been opened in
 refurbished premises which previously 
 housed Easthorpe C.E. School.Upstairs 
 is a gallery in which photographs &amp;   
 paintings are on display.The rest of  
 the building is set out in studios    
 which are used mainly by young artists
 who have just left art school.Groups  
 of children can go and see artists    
 working with various media.           </content>
