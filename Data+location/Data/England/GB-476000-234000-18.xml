		<content> Energy requirements are confined to   
 domestic and agricultural use, there  
 being no industrial users. The choices
 are restricted as there is no gas     
 main. The area is dependant on        
 electricity for much of its domestic  
 energy; cooking, lighting and domestic
 appliances; a few homes have solid    
 fuel cooking ranges.                  
 The majority of homes use oil fired   
 central heating, but since oil prices 
 have soared several have converted to 
 solid fuel, with the occasional one to
 bulk gas.                             
 On the farms energy mainly comes from 
 2 sources, diesel fuel for motive     
 power and electricity for heating,    
 lighting, milking etc.                
 Current approximate costs:            
 Oil          19.2p litre              
 Coal         Â£5.00  cwt               
 Electricity   5.3p  unit              </content>
