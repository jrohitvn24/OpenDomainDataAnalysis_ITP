		<title>11OUT OF MY WINDOW I CAN SEE</title>
		<content>                                       
      I look out of my{bedroom window  
 and I have not got a good view! I look
 and I can see the train tracks and the
{trains}going past. When I look over   
 the wall where the{trains}pass I can  
 see Somers Town but that is not a good
 view either. Everything is just the   
 same. There are not many trees. I can 
 see blocks of flats and boys and girls
 playing in the park.                  
      When I look to the other side I  
 can see people coming home from work  
 or getting into their cars and        
 children riding by.                   
      When night comes I look from my  
 window and it is pitch black. I see   
 the{trains}go past with lights on and 
 sparks coming from the tracks and cars
 flash past with their headlights      
 shining.                              
                                       </content>
