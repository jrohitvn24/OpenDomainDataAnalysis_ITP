 village of Old Warden.It was built in 
 the 12th century,and has six bells,the

 scenes.Some are in memory of members  
 of the Shuttleworth family.There are  
 many beautiful carvings,some from     
 Italy,Belgium and France,particularly 
 carvings of snakes on the end of the  
 pews.Some of the panels come from a   
 private chapel in Bruges and are of
