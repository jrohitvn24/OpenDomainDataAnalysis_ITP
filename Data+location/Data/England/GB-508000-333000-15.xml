		<title>15MOBILE SHOPS</title>
		<content>  As the choice of shops in a rural    
 area is limited people rely on the    
 mobile shops a great deal especially  
 older people who cannot manage on the 
 buses and who have nobody either to   
 take them to town or to go for them.  
  Horbling and Billingborough have     
 several mobile shops including 4      
 butchers who come on different days, a
 greengrocer who comes once a week, a  
 baker, a grocer, a wet fish van, a    
 Fish and Chip van and of course the   
 daily milk delivery. The latter is    
 very important in rural districts as  
 it is the only way of getting fresh   
 milk.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
