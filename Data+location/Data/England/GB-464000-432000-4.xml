		<title>04Pig farming near Cliffe</title>
		<content>      Pigs are usually kept in big     
 cubicles with about 20 pigs in each.  
 In summer when the weather is hot they
 are allowed to roll about in mud and  
 dirt to keep them cool.               
      When the sow is going to have    
 piglets she is kept separate. When she
 has had her litter she is put in a    
 farrowing pen. That has a fence to    
 stop the sow lying on the piglets, but
 they can feed from her through the    
 fence. They don't get any warmth from 
 their mother, so they have a heater to
 keep them warm.                       
      The pigs can feed themselves from
 hoppers, and they can drink by        
 pressing their snouts on a valve.     
      Pigs are bred for pork or        
 bacon. Porkers weigh about 45kg. at   
 three months, and bacon pigs weigh    
 about 65kg. at four or five months.
