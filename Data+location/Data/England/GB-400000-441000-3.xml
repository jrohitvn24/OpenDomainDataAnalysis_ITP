		<title>03THE SOUTH-EAST VIEW.</title>
		<content>  The south-east view from the highest 
 point,is largely urbanised.In the     
 distance one can see the outskirts of 
 Bradford and in the foreground the    
 town of Keighley.In the valley bottom 
 is the industrial area of Keighley and
 on the slopes above are the           
 residential areas including the Fell  
 Lane Estate,Riddlesden,Braithwaite,   
 Ingrow and the Shann Park Estate.     
  Looking S.W. one can see in the      
 distance the Haworth Moors including  
 Penistone Hill at 1030ft.These moors  
 are said to have been used by the     
 Bronte Sisters for the backgrounds to 
 their novels.                         
  A sand quarry can be clearly seen on 
 the hillside above Keighley.One can   
 also see Goose Eye,a quaint village,  
 in the valley bottom,famous locally   
 for the Turkey Inn.
