 The Methodist Church at Stibbard is   
 part of the Fakenham and Wells Circuit
 and is served by a Superintendent     
 Minister, the Reverend Arthur Kirkman 
 based at Fakenham. The meetings for   
 worship, held at 11.00am each Sunday  
 are attended by about 12  people, and 
 are led, either by the minister or a  
 local preacher.                       
 A Sunday School meets at the same time
 as the adult congregation, leaving for
 their own lessons in the schoolroom   
 after the first 15 minutes.  Each     
 service would consist of 4 or 5 hymns 
 with prayers, and readings from the   
 Old and New Testaments.
