		<content> The nearest doctors surgery is 2Km SW 
 at Markfield,other GP's are at least  
 4KM away.Accident cases are taken to a
 Leicester hospital 14Km S.Police cover
 is minimal the nearest police station 
 is in Coalville 8Km W.The government  
 of Charnwood can pose quite a problem 
 for the residents as within this area 
 there are 6 Civil Parishes,3 District 
 Councils and 3 Parliamentary          
 Constituencies.Four parishes meet at  
 the Copt Oak crossroads.This can      
 present 4 different policies for the  
 hamlet.                               
 Several ecclesiastical parishes       
 cover Charnwood but the one C of E    
 church is at Copt Oak and the parson  
 is shared with Oaks in Charnwood.     
 Times for the one Sunday service vary 
 weekly.This is the only place of      
 worship,Charley Chapel in Charley Road
 now converted to a house.             </content>
