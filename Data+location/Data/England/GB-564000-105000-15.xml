		<title>15Rockhouse Bank</title>
		<content> Rockhouse Bank was so named because it
 was built on a rocky bank in the      
 marshes. There was once a monastery on
 the Bank but now there are only stone 
 and ruins. You can see the sea from   
 Rockhouse Bank. There is a house now  
 on top of the Bank and one outside    
 wall is painted black to try and      
 lessen the damage from the sea salt   
 spray. The monks dug the ditches      
 around their monastery and made sure  
 that they ran into Waller's Haven     
 which leads to the sea. Most of this  
 land is summer grazing. Much of the   
 marsh is owned by the Nature          
 Conservation Council and it is like a 
 reserve and the farmers are required  
 not to use chemicals (sprays) on this 
 land.
