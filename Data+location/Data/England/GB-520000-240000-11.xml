		<title>11EVENTS IN HINXWORTH</title>
		<content> Hinxworth cannot be accused of being  
 without a soul. There is a plethora of
 organisations adding generously to the
 colour and flavour of its life. It is 
 a mini society ready and able to jump 
 into action when any part of it has a 
 problem.For example when the village  
 rallied round to plant 400 trees on   
 the old sewage farm site or when the  
 village hall needed extending or when 
 the lead was stolen from the church   
 roof and scores of straw bales were   
 needed to secure it.Among the annual  
 events are the village supper with its
 homespun entertainment, the WI's      
 birthday party, the over 60's outing, 
 the children's christmas party, the   
 summer Jazz evening and the New Year's
 Eve party.Church gift Day shows the   
 wish to keep the church in good repair
 for future generations and the newly  
 restored bells will continue to ring. </content>
