		<title>18BLACKO VILLAGE POLICEMAN</title>
		<content> We interviewed our Village Policeman  
 about his job, his name is{Police     
{Constable Michael Duerden.}His base is
 Nelson Police Station and he is in G  
 Division. He patrols{Blacko, Barley,  
{Roughlee and Newchurch.}He has to     
 carry a two way radio with him which  
 is called a{Walkie Talkie.}He has to  
 carry this with him even when he isn't
 in uniform. Mr. Duerden comes to      
 Blacko four times a week usually for  
 four hours each day. The crimes in    
 rural areas are very different to     
 those in towns. He says that compared 
 to the big towns of Nelson and Burnley
 there is very little vandalism in our 
 block. He has to deal with crimes like
 sheep stealing and poaching. He said  
 that his worst job was when he had to 
 shoot a stray bull in Barrowford.He   
 enjoys his job very much.
