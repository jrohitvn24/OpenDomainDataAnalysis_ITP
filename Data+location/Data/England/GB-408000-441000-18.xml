		<content> and other jewellery by Carol Atkinson 
   Some of the houses in Micklethwaite 
 were built in 16O1.The windows were   
 made in tudor times at the begining of
 the sixteenth century.Two of the three
 houses still have the original lantern
 above the windows on the ground floor.
 There is a stone ledge,the dripstone  
 above all the windows this was to stop
 the rain leaving streaks on the       
 windows also to stop the noise of the 
 rain.Most of Micklethwaite is farmland
 the houses all look down onto         
 farmland.
