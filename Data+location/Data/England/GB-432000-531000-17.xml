		<title>17PLAYGROUND GAMES</title>
		<content> Usually the boys play football in the 
 playground especially in the Winter   
 and Autumn, and cricket or rounders in
 the Summer. When there is snow on the 
 ground children bring large plastic   
 sacks with which to slide down the    
 hill.                                 
 Another game is British Bulldog. In   
 this game one person who is the       
 'catcher' stands in the middle of the 
 playground. The rest of the players   
 line up at one end of the playground  
 and then have to run to the other end 
 without being caught by the catcher.If
 a player gets caught before reaching  
 the other end of the playground he    
 must then help the catcher 'catch' the
 others. When everyone has been caught 
 the game restarts usually with the    
 first person who was caught being the 
 catcher.                              
                                       </content>
