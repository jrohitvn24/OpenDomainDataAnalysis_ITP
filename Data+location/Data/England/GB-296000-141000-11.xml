		<content> growth is protected by a kind of moss,
 known to the huntsman as 'velvet'.    
 This shields the horn in the growing  
 period, but as the horn matures, the  
 covering irritates and the stag gets  
 rid of it by rubbing its head against 
 trees. Once this protection has gone  
 it is only then that the horn becomes 
 bone hard. In the growing stage a     
 stag's horns are quite soft.          
 It is a rule of Exmoor Forest that    
 whoever finds a pair of horns may keep
 them.                                 
 There are some magnificent specimens  
 of deer to be found on Exmoor some of 
 the finest weighing perhaps 350       
 pounds.
