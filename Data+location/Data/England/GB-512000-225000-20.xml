		<title>20CHANGING TIMES IN OFFLEY.</title>
		<content> The First and Second World Wars       
 brought great changes to Offley as    
 they did to the rest of the country.  
 Farming methods perforce were changed,
 labourers were no longer content with 
 their lot.Mechanisation on the farms  
 meant that fewer men were needed to   
 work the land.The local people looked 
 elsewhere for employment,transport was
 available to take them daily into     
 Luton or Hitchin.                     
  Offley became a main thoroughfare    
 between Hitchin and Luton and the     
 steep hill became a bottleneck on the 
 A 505 until a by-pass was built.      
  The Luton straw hat industry declined
 as foreign competition increased but  
 other industries came to take its     
 place.The Vauxhall Car Company and the
 airport at Luton now provide          
 employment for many of the local      
 people.                               </content>
