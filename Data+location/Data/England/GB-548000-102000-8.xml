		<title>08THE POPULATION OF ALFRISTON</title>
		<content> Alfriston has a population of 807,    
 many of whom have come to live in     
 Alfriston on retirement.  It has a    
 Parish Council, non-political, of 8   
 members elected every 3 years who make
 recommendations to the Wealden        
 District Council which administers the
 area.  They are in the Lewes          
 Parliamentary constituency.  There is 
 no resident policeman. The area to the
 west of the High St. is residential.  
 There is a garage for servicing cars. 
 The Primary School is in North Road   
 and next to it is the playing field   
 which belongs to the Parish Council.  
 Also in North Road is the Doctor's    
 Surgery and an Abbeyfield Sheltered   
 Home for the elderly is being built.  
 Any new building in Alfriston is      
 infilling for which planning          
 permission has to be sought. Council  
 houses were erected in the 1930s.     </content>
