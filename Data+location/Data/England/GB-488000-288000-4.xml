		<title>04The Town Centre, Corby.</title>
		<content>Corby's town centre was originally     
planned in the 1950's and so today is  
considerably out of date, although     
there have been numerous attempts to   
update it. Originally there were two   
rows of shops along the main street    
with a market and bus station at one   
end. In the 1970's the main street was 
pedestrianised allowing safer shopping 
and a new development which included   
shops and offices, a library, cinema   
and multi-storey car park was built.   
This is known as Queen's Square. The   
later development of a large           
supermarket completed the facilities.  
The area has been given covered walk-  
ways but because it is on a split level
catches the wind. Plans were unveiled  
this year to completely enclose the    
centre but the decision by the District
Council to build a new shopping centre 
has jeopardised these plans.           </content>
