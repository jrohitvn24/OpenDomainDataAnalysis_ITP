		<content> On the outskirts of Harden can be     
 found St.Ives Estate which combines   
 moorland, woodland, parkland and      
 recreation facilities.                
 There is a Nature Trail through the   
 Estate which enables you to see the   
 varied plant life. There are          
 snowdrops, bluebells and many         
 rhododendron bushes depending on the  
 season.                               
 You can find both coniferous and      
 deciduous trees in which birds such as
 curlaws, woodpeckers and cuckoos nest.
 If you are quiet you may see foxes,   
 squirrels or rabbits.                 
 The coppice pond provides a variety of
 fish for the fisherman. The ducks     
 which nest and breed on the central   
 island enjoy being fed by visitors.
