		<title>09MOOREND DAIRY FARM ASHPERTON</title>
		<content> Moorend Farm covers 148 acres and has 
 been the same size for at least the   
 last 30 years. The land is gently     
 sloping and is mainly sown grass, the 
 soil being good and fertile although  
 heavy. Altogether the farm has about  
 Â£20,000 invested in machinery         
 including four tractors. The farm     
 keeps its own Dairy Shorthorn bull    
 which serves the better cows in the   
 herd. Artificial Insemination is used 
 for breeding from the poorer stock.   
 There are seventy cows in the herd,   
 predominantly Shorthorns (but with    
 three or four Friesians). Twenty five 
 per cent of the calves bred are kept. 
 The farm also has ten ewes which are  
 of a rare breed.
