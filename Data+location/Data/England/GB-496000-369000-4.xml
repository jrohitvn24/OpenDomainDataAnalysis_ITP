		<title>04THE CASTLE BESIEGED,LINCOLN.</title>
		<content> Every year the{Civil War  siege}of the
 castle is re-enacted.I  went to  watch
 it. I  walked  through  the  gates and
 found people dressed in  old-fashioned
 clothes sitting around their tents and
 cooking. Then came the  best bit - the
{storming  of  the  castle.}It  started
 with a large bang which  made everyone
 jump. This  was  to  represent the    
{Parliamentarians}coming up{Steep Hill.
 You could hear  the  distant beat of a
 drum  and  then  another  bang as they
 reached the{Castle square.}People fled
 for their lives  as  the Castle  gates
 opened. The {Royalists }were  building
 a  barrier  when  the Parliamentarians
 arrived holding guns,pikes and swords.
 There  were a lot of bangs and screams
 as  the  attackers  moved  forward. A 
 priest who killed a boy had his throat
 cut. The  coward who kept running away
 was kicked.Soon{the castle had fallen.</content>
