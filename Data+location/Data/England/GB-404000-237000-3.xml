		<title>03MONDAY IS MARKET DAY - 1</title>
		<content> A morning in the life of a farmer's   
 wife. Monday is Gloucester market day.
 Up at 5.30am to help sort out fat     
 lambs and cattle and load them in the 
 lorry for my husband to take to       
 market. By 7.30am he has left with his
 breakfast, bacon and egg sandwiches,  
 not having had time to sit at table. I
 help take the sheep back to their     
 field. I look at the other flock, the 
 cattle in the Rough Ground and the    
 cows and calves in Shepherds Leys, not
 forgetting the mares and foals. Back  
 at the house the coffee pot is a      
 welcome sight. I am ready to enjoy a  
 cup only to be disturbed by the       
 telephone. "Are your cattle out on the
 road?" asks the caller. "I don't think
 so I have just looked at our stock,   
 thank you for calling." The morning   
 has flown - lunchtime already.        
                                       </content>
