		<title>17Chatteris - Factory Fire</title>
		<content> On Wednesday 19th June, 1985 the      
 potato packing factory in New Road,   
 Chatteris, caught on fire.  It started
 in the canteen only minutes after the 
 production line workers had left to   
 begin their 8.00am shift.             
                                       
 The Production Line Manager, Mr David 
 Baxter said he was pleased at the     
 speed with which everyone got out of  
 the building.  People did not panic,  
 leaving the building in a sensible    
 way.  This he said made it easy to    
 check that the building was clear.    
                                       
 The Fire Brigade arrived very quickly 
 and took about half an hour to bring  
 the fire under control.               
                                       
 Mr Baxter hoped production would start
 again as soon as possible.
