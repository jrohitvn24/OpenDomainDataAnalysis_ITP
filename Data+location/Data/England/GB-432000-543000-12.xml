		<title>12FARMING</title>
		<content>   The land around Pittington and      
 Littletown sustains a variety of      
 farming. Eight farms were studied by  
 the children, and they learnt that    
 farming is considered more of a "way  
 of life" than a "job of work".        
{  Hallgarth Farm}is approximately 230 
 acres. The Hodgson family keep pigs   
 and a beef herd. This year 100 acres  
 was used for cereals and 20 acres for 
 peas, with 90 acres of grass for hay. 
   The Middlemass family at{Littletown 
{Farm}farm 66.5 hectares. They grow    
 wheat (9.2 hectares), winter barley   
 (14.1h), spring barley (9.7h), oats   
 (2.9h), &amp; potatoes (3.8h). Their beef 
 herd consists of Limosin and Charolais
 crosses.                              
  {Glenmoor Farm }and {Town Farm}are   
 now one farm of 200 acres. They have a
 fine Friesian dairy herd &amp; 3,000 hens.
 Cereals,potatoes &amp; turnips are grown. </content>
