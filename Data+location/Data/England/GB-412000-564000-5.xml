		<title>05THE DAY OF A NURSERY CHILD.</title>
		<content>    I am 4. I go to  school in the     
 afternoon. You play all different     
 things. I play in the baker's shop. I 
 play with the slide and the jigsaws. I
 like  painting best. I paint rainbows.
 We sit down in the home corner and do 
 the register.                         
    Sometimes we go outside. We play on
 the bikes outside and run around. We  
 do planting. George, the gardener,    
 made the butterfly garden. It is      
 round. We planted pretty flowers.     
    My mammy comes to Nursery to bake. 
 We have snacks and milk. Then we sing.
 I like playing with the "Lego".We have
 a story. We do our prayers when mammy 
 is coming.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
