		<content>Most of the houses in the village have 
been built since 1960. They are        
constructed of brick or stone and are  
in small groups off the one through    
road - Priory Close, Ventfield Close,  
The Orchard, Forge Close and more      
recently Mill Lane. Several groups have
won design awards for their architects.
Most of the houses in the village have 
garages for one or two cars. Our survey
showed that about 60% of the houses    
have some double glazing and most of   
the houses are heated by oil, although 
coal, wood and electricity are also    
used. There is no mains gas supply to  
the village. A few houses use bottled  
gas. Of the older houses there are     
still one or two thatched houses once  
so common in this village.
