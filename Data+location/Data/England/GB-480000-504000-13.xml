 Our school is 111 years old and was   
 built by the{Foster}family. It is     
 built of stone and has a slate roof,  
 and has the original fire places still
 intact.                               
                                       
 The school is little, having 2 class  
 rooms which are separated by a screen.
 The school has changed a bit since    
{1874,}it has a computer now (!) and we
 do different maths.                   
                                       
 Outside the school we have a liitle   
 kitchen joined on, in which our 2     
 cooks cook dinner for us to eat.      
                                       
 It is a pretty little school with     
 lovely scenery all around it. The     
 school's{30 pupils}took part in the   
{Domesday Project}in 1985.             </content>
