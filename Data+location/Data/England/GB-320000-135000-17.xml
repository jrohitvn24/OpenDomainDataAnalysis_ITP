		<title>17A DAY AT SPAXTON SCHOOL</title>
		<content> I arrive at school at about five to   
 nine. The bell goes at nine and we go 
 into the classroom.Mrs Bryant calls   
 the register.Then we line up for      
 assembly which lasts for about twenty 
 minutes. When we come back to the     
 classroom usually on Tuesday we do our
 spellings.  When we have done our     
 spellings Group 1 and 2 do Basic      
 English and Groups 3 and 4 do Scottish
 Maths until play time. At 11.00 we do 
 country dancing then our Group work   
 again. At 11.55 we pack up for dinner.
 Our classroom is used as the dining   
 room. A lady called Mrs Barks comes to
 look after us. Each  table has a      
 leader.We start work at 1.10 with     
 project and reading.During playtime we
 change for swimming. There are three  
 Groups according to how good they     
 are. Back in the classroom we say a   
 prayer then we say Good after noon.   </content>
