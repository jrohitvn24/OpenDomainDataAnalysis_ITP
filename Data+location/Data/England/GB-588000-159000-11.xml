		<content>The Church of England School was built 
in 1868.There are two full-time staff  
and one part-time secretary.Pupils are 
taken from the village, their ages     
ranging from five to eleven.They then  
have to make the three mile journey to 
secondary schools in Sittingbourne.The 
school is very much a part of village  
life and all the people are very       
supportive; the parent teachers        
association does most of the fund      
raising.The number of pupils has       
decreased over the years, from 74 ten  
years ago to 36.The school still has a 
Second World War air raid shelter in   
the grounds which is used for storing  
cleaning and sports equipment.The      
school buildings include a teacher's   
house and recent modifications have    
included lower ceilings, the old being 
thirty feet high.
