		<content> The Flower Festival was held in the   
 parish church from 13-15th July,1984. 
 The theme was, " Following in the     
 steps of the Lord." There was a       
 Festival Service in the church on the 
 Sunday morning. In the evening the    
 Hereford Madrigal Society gave a      
 concert. The Festival raised Â£3,000   
 for church funds. Clun Road Show took 
 place on the Old Castle Grounds. It   
 was a pilot programme for a possible  
 series based on country life. BBC     
 cameras came to film the village show 
 which they had arranged. The programme
 was broadcast on BBC television. The  
 church bells came back in October     
 1981. They had gone to the bell       
 foundry in Loughborough to have       
 new headstocks, clappers &amp; bearings   
 fitted. BBC regional news filmed      
 their return to Clun. There was a     
 procession through the streets.       </content>
