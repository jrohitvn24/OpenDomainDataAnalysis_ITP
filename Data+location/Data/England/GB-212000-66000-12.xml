		<content> My name is Emily my mummy and daddy   
 are{artists their names are Graham and
{Annie Ovenden}and they make a living  
 from it.  In Cardinham there are not  
 very many artists.  In Mount Jane     
 Dickenson makes{patchwork quilts.     
 Joseph Hewes paints in oils like my   
 mummy and daddy.  Mum also does       
 acrylics.  My daddy is also a         
 photographer, you can make quite a lot
 of money being an artist, it depends  
 on how good you are. I asked Joseph   
 Hewes if he like painting - he said   
 "yes, but sometimes I think I will    
 give it up".  He does not really know 
 why he likes painting it's just       
 something he has to do.  They all sell
 their things at exhibitions and from  
 home.  My dad is a member of the      
{Ruralists}which hold exhibitions.
