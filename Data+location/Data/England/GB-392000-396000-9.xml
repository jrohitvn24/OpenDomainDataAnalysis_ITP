		<title>09HOUSING AROUND AUDENSHAW (1)</title>
		<content>   Audenshaw is very much a suburban   
 area and its development of housing   
 dates from the early 1930's; with two 
 industrial estates bordering the area.
   There are many{detached}and         
{semi-detached}houses with gardens.    
 Large bay windowed{terraced}houses are
 found on the main Ashton to Denton    
 road - most of which have back        
 gardens. Two new housing developments 
 cater for{detached}and{semi-detached  
 modern homes. The 1930's bay windowed 
 houses were not built with garages,   
 they have small kitchens and large    
 gardens which is somewhat opposite to 
 the building trends of 1985.          
   There is a council house estate of  
{semi-detached}houses, each has its own
 garden.
