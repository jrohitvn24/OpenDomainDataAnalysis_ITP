		<title>05NEW SUPERSTORE IN WEST HULL</title>
		<content>  We were met by the supervisor who was
 to show us round the new superstore.  
 First we saw shelves being checked and
 learned that the information would be 
 fed into the computer for fast        
 re-ordering to maintain an efficient  
 service.                              
 Wearing special hats and following our
 noses we went into the bakery where we
 saw modern equipment making bread and 
 cakes. We learned how to put jam into 
 doughnuts and cream into buns.        
 Next door the butchers were cutting,  
 packing and labelling meat.           
 Vegetables and fruit are stored in a  
 "cold" room and wine behind locked    
 doors. We watched as supplies were    
 unloaded with the aid of a forklift.  
  On our way out we caught sight of the
 enormous cake specially made for the  
 stores first birthday.
