		<content>  Many religions are represented in our
 area.Members of the{Christian faith   
 predominate but many immigrants coming
 here have brought their religions with
 them.                                 
  We have found members of the         
 following religions-{Buddhism,Judaism,
{Islam,Sikhism}and{Hinduism.}The       
 Sikhs,Hindus and Buddhists have       
 shrines within their own homes and    
 visit their places of worship less    
 frequently than the Moslems and       
 Jews.Most adhere closely to their     
 feasts and fasts although this may    
 cause absences at school or work.     
  Of the people who call themselves    
 Christians few attend church regularly
 and many are ignorant of what this    
 faith proclaims-that there is only one
 way to{God}and that is by belief in   
 the{Lord Jesus Christ}as a personal   
 Saviour,and following Him.            </content>
