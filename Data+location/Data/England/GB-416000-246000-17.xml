		<title>17BROWNIES:           QUINTON</title>
		<content>   The movement for young girls, known 
 as Brownies, has had some connection  
 in the village since 1962.            
   The Brownie group used to meet in   
 the Women's Institute room at the top 
 of Friday Street. They moved from     
 there to the village hall, and are now
 based in the community centre which   
 occupies a pair of army quarters.     
   They meet for about two hours each  
 Thursday evening in school term time. 
   The girls in Brownies are aged      
 between 6 and 11. They wear a brown   
 dress with various badges on.         
   Their activities include bookwork,  
 games and working for badges.         
   There are about 24 girls in the     
 Brownie pack.                         
  Brownies are the only national youth 
 group based in the village, apart from
 the youth club.
