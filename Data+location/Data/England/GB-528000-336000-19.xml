		<content> Interviews with two local people have 
 indicated many ways in which life has 
 changed dramatically in Kirton in     
 recent years.Mr.Timson,the village    
 Pharmacist,notices a particular       
 increase in Kirton's elderly          
 population.Two local Old Peoples'     
 Homes,improvements in health care and 
 people retiring to Kirton,are all     
 contributory factors.Previously,most  
 people living in Kirton also worked in
 Agriculture; now a larger proportion  
 are mobile'white-collar'workers.      
 Closure of the local railway has      
 greatly increased freight  and goods  
 traffic on our roads.Bus services have
 decreased,but so has the popularity of
 South Lincs'most popular mode of      
 transport-the bike!Greater mobility   
 has resulted in the use of Kirton far 
 more as a'dormitory'area;in fact one  
 third of our pupils'bus-in'each day.  </content>
