		<content> Older village houses are built in     
 Hornton stone. Although two or three  
 old houses were built with some       
 deference to style, most are very     
 basic cottages which were originally  
 thatched. An estate of council houses 
 is situated in Wheeler's Rise, next to
 the Playing Fields.  There are also   
 12 council bungalows in the Portway   
 Estate, at the eastern edge of the    
 village - in the main for pensioners. 
 The whole estate of about 50 houses   
 consists of middle price range        
 bungalows and houses, occupied by     
 families who are mostly integrated    
 within the community, although they do
 have their own 'inner' community too -
 they ran a Fireworks Party last year. 
 At the end of the Estate is a         
 development becoming known as 'Little 
 America', as 8 of the 10 houses are   
 occupied by US personnel.             </content>
