		<title>17A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> I wake up at 7am thanks to my alarm   
 clock and take an annual from my      
 cupboard and read for 25 minutes. Then
 I get up and get dressed. I wake my   
 mum and dad up, take my bag down and  
 leave it by the door. Then I bring in 
 the milk, have my breakfast (which is 
 usually Coco-pops),and pack my        
 lunchbox, which consists of cheese and
 marmite sandwiches, a Granny Smith    
 apple, a packet of crisps, a chocolate
 biscuit and a small carton of milk    
 shake.After I have put my lunchbox in 
 my bag, I go upstairs, wash, brush my 
 teeth and comb my hair.Then I put on  
 my coat and feed my rabbit and then I 
 am usually taken to school by car.I am
 dropped off at school 5 minutes before
 the bell is rung.I put my bag in the  
 cloakroom and go up on to the         
 playground to play football with my   
 friends.                              </content>
