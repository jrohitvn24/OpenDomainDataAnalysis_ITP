		<title>19THE LIFE OF A MINER</title>
		<content> It is quite difficult changing your   
 eating habits and organising your home
 life when you are on a different shift
 every week. When Jonathan's dad is on 
 nights he sleeps all through the      
 morning until about 1 o'clock, so     
 everybody has to be very quiet in the 
 house during this time.               
 Some men still take their 'snap' or   
 food underground with them in a 'snap 
 tin', an air tight tin that keeps out 
 the coal dust. Others get a meal at   
 the pit canteen when they come up.    
 The cage or lift that takes the men   
 down the shaft travels at 4 metres per
 second and the pressure affects your  
 ears as you go down. The temperature  
 gets higher as you go deeper under the
 ground. The coal seam they are working
 at the moment at Creswell is less than
 a metre high, so there isn't much room
 to work in. It's hard being a miner!  </content>
