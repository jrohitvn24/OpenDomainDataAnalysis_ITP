		<title>13Keswick's Cottage Hospital</title>
		<content> The Cottage Hospital is a small       
 hospital and it is only used for      
 people who are ill or have broken arms
 or legs.If you were about to have a   
 baby you would have to go to a big    
 hospital like Carlisle or             
 Whitehaven.The busiest day in the     
 hospital is a Saturday because schools
 are off and the children are playing  
 around the market square.There are two
 stairs in the hospital.One of the     
 stairs leads to the staffs rooms.The  
 other leads to the physiotherapy.This 
 is where they lift things to get their
 muscles working.Each day they have a  
 good variety of food,and tea is at    
 3.30pm.In the kitchens they have a    
 large fridge.In the hospital they have
 one floor for their work and they have
 an Xray room.They have no children's  
 wards in this hospital.
