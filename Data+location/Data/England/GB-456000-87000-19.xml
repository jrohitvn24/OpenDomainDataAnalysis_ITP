		<title>19The Nursery at Ashey</title>
		<content>  Mr and Mrs Fox run the nursery. They 
 have lived here for 22 years.They do  
 their shopping in Ryde and go to      
 church in Brading. They find there is 
 always plenty to do in the nursery but
 when they want some entertainment they
 have a barbecue.                      
  For their holidays they have visited 
 Holland and Guernsey.                 
  Their nursery is right on the road   
 and Mr Fox has to see the customers'  
 cars safely out of his entrance.
