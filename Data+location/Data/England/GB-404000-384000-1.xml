		<title>01South West of Kinder Low</title>
		<content> The area is on the South Western side 
 of Kinder Scout in the Peak District  
 National Park. The land slopes down to
 the west, its eastern margin being the
 edge of Kinder Low. The word 'Low'    
 means an ancient burial mound. The    
 geology is gritstone and shale. Many  
 springs rise from the slope and give  
 rise to the River Sett and the area   
 forms a catchment area for Kinder     
 Reservoir. Many old pack horse routes 
 cross the area and there is a fine    
 example of a pack horse bridge. The   
 land is mainly used for sheep grazing 
 and there is a cover of rough grass   
 with heather high up on the slope. The
 National Trust own much of the land   
 and 2 farms in the area and are doing 
 experimental work on re-planting and  
 conservation on the moorland. The area
 is a very popular rambling area. The  
 Pennine Way runs northwards in the E. </content>
