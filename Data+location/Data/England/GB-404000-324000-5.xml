		<title>05A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A CHILD</title>
		<content> I wake up and get dressed and I go out
 to feed the ducklings and get water   
 for the sheep and I help in the       
 milking parlour and then I have some  
 tea and then I go in for breakfast and
 then I come to school by taxi and then
 we go to the hall and when we come out
 we do a drawing and then we do maps   
 and then we go for dinner and then we 
 go swimming and then I go home by taxi
 again and I play outside and I come in
 for my tea and go to bed about half   
 past seven and stay up playing in my  
 bedroom until about nine o'clock.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
