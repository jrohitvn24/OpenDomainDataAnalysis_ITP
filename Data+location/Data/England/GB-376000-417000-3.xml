		<content> Most of the houses in our block are   
 concentrated in the eastern quarter,in
 the villages of Edenfield and         
 Stubbins.Ninety per cent of the houses
 are terraced or semi-detached.The     
 terraces were mainly built in the 19th
 century from locally quarried         
 stone.Most of the semi-detached houses
 are on estates,including one large    
 council estate,and are made of        
 brick.There are one or two smaller    
 estates of detached houses.There are  
 very few flats,all of which are in    
 low-rise blocks.Among the oldest      
 houses in the area are the {CROFTERS' 
{COTTAGES}in Market Street,Edenfield,  
 and{LUMB MANOR HOUSE}nearby.The most  
 recent houses have just been built on 
 a small development at Church Lane    
 near Edenfield Parish Church.
