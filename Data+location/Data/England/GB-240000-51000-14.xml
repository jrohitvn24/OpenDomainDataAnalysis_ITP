		<content> 1 tonne packs -this looks like sugar  
 crystals.It is expanded 20 times by   
 forcing air into it,so that they      
 become polystyrene beads,which are    
 very light in weight.These are then   
 used to produce surfboards,all kinds  
 of packaging,floats,coving etc.Now    
 they are colouring the beads to       
 produce multicoloured surfboards.Any  
 items made for the MOD are coloured   
 olive green.Items are transported by  
 contracted lorries to the rest of     
 Britain.They do not export because of 
 the volume of the packages and the    
 high cost of transport.The Poron      
 Factory is owned by the Metal Closures
 Group PLC.
