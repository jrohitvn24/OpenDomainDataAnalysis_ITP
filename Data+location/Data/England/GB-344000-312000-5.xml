		<title>05ROYAL SHREWSBURY HOSPITAL.</title>
		<content> People from all over Shropshire and   
 Mid Wales come to the Royal Shrewsbury
 Hospital for treatment. The oldest    
 part, Shelton, is a large Psychiatric 
 hospital. In 1938 the Americans built 
 Copthorne South, which was originally 
 used for wounded soldiers, but is now 
 a busy general hospital with 389 beds.
 Copthorne South has 2 children's wards
 and will soon have the 'Tiny Tim      
 Playroom' built with money raised     
 during the filming of 'A Christmas    
 Carol' in Shrewsbury in 1984. The     
 Maternity hospital is on the same site
 as the new Copthorne North, which was 
 opened by Prince Charles in 1978. A   
 cobalt unit, costing Â£100,000 was     
 built in 1982. The money was raised by
 local people, and the children at our 
 school, Woodfield, gave Â£268.
