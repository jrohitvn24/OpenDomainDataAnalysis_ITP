		<title>11Children's Views of Aldridge</title>
		<content> Aldridge is a nice place to live      
 because it is quiet and I have friends
 here to play with. Aldridge Shopping  
 centre is better than Walsall because 
 all the shops are in one big group and
 so you only have a short distance to  
 walk to get to another shop. It is a  
 good place because you have plenty of 
 ground in the area to play on. Behind 
 the factory called T.I. there are     
 football pitches and a woodland walk. 
 Opposite where I live there is a park 
 but it keeps getting vandalised and   
 the council take things away like the 
 slide. Anchor Meadow could be improved
 by removing some of the rubbish. They 
 cleared ground there to build a       
 hospital but changed their mind. I    
 really enjoy living in Aldridge, the  
 people are friendly. At school in     
 Summer I play on our sports field. At 
 least we are not stuck in the town.   </content>
