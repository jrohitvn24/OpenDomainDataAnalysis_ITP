 very old houses, some date back to    
 before Tudor times.There is also an   
 old church which is 150 years old.The 
 only shop in the village is the Post  
 Office which sells most things needed.
                                       
{LEISURE}-Around the motorway,there is

{HEDGES AND BUSHES(VEGETATION)}-There  
 are many hedges and bushes, mainly on 
 the Eastern side by the ridge.The     
 vegetaton is plentiful in the area.In 
 the hedges we found wild plants       
 growing.Some examples are dogroses,ivy
 and also a lot of hawthorn and some   
 bramble bushes.
