		<content> Predominantly high heather covered    
 moorland devoted to sheep farming and 
 grouse shooting. West Beck runs north 
 through the area creating a valley    
 that can be used for farming.         
 Predominantly sheep and cattle grazing
 but in the northern part of the valley
 towards Goathland quite a lot of      
 woodland, deciduous and coniferous    
 plantation. Below the moorland there  
 is a scattering of farms and the north
 contains part of the spread out       
 village of Goathland, mostly          
 residential houses and a couple of    
 hotels. Because the area is very      
 picturesque (especially Goathland) it 
 is much visited by tourists, some of  
 whom stay in the area in hotels or    
 youth hostel. Also a popular area with
 walks because of the unspoilt woodland

 accessibility and facilities in       </content>
