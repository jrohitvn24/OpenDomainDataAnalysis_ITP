		<content> THE LIFE STYLE HAS BEEN GREATLY       
 INFLUENCED BY THE CLOSING OF THE      
 VILLAGE SCHOOL,POST OFFICE,SHOP,AND   
 THE CUTTING DOWN OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT  
 DURING RECENT YEARS.CHILDREN FROM 5   
 YEARS HAVE TO TRAVEL TO SCHOOLS       
 OUTSIDE THE AREA.WORKERS OTHER THAN   
 THOSE LIVING ON THE FARMS NEED PRIVATE
 TRANSPORT TO REACH WORK IN KENDAL,    
 WINDERMERE,OR AS FAR AFIELD AS BARROW 
 OR LANCASTER.THERE IS NO DOCTOR'S     
 SURGERY,BUT THERE IS A DISTRICT NURSE.
 THE GREAT WAR MEMORIAL HALL IS THE    
 MEETING PLACE FOR THE YOUNG FARMERS   
 CLUB,THE WOMEN'S INSTITUTE AND THE    
 CROOK FOLK DANCE SOCIETY.TO RAISE     
 MONEY FOR THE UPKEEP OF THE HALL,2    
 RUMMAGE SALES AND 2 WHIST DRIVES ARE  
 HELD EACH YEAR,PLUS COFFEE EVENINGS,  
 AND OTHER PARTIES ON FESTIVE          
 OCCASIONS.                            
                                       </content>
