		<content>The local Liberal Association was      
formed in 1981 originally as part of   
the Sudbury and Woodbridge constituency
but following boundary changes is now  
part of the South Suffolk constituency.
The liberal association is very active 
on local issues with campaigns to      
improve street lighting, pavements,    
safety on school buses and dangerous   
road junctions.This has been           
particularly important in the area as  
increased road traffic on the A12 has  
caused hazards where it has            
intersections with minor               
roads.Fund-raising and social events   
 re held regularly to fund             
 county,distict and parish             
council elections.Also a newsletter    
called Focus is produced twice a       
yearnd and delivered to every          
household in the area.
