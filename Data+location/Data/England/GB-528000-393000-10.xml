		<content> I usually have 4 meals a day,         
 breakfast, dinner, tea and supper. For
 breakfast I have a cereal then a round
 of toast and a cup of tea. For lunch  
 in school I have four sandwiches, a   
 bit of cake and a drink, but in the   
 holidays for dinner I have anything   
 from shepherd's pie to salad. For     
 sweet I have from chocolate pudding   
 with chocolate sauce to ice-cream.    
 When I get in from school I sometimes 
 have a Twix and a drink or something  
 like that. For tea I have a cold meal;
 salad or sausage roll, or thing like  
 that, with a cup of tea. But sometimes
 I have a cooked meal. For supper I    
 have 3 biscuits ,the Jacob's ones,    
 with some cheese and a drink of milk  
 and sometimes I have some biscuits.
