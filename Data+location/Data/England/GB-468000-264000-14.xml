  Harlestone,Church Brampton and       
Althorp are served by mains water      
supply.Many springs and wells have     
existed and still do.                  
  The sewerage works near Church       
Brampton was taken out of commission in
1981 and most of the site sold.A small 
pumping station remains to pump        
Harlestone waste to a further station  
serving Church Brampton and another    
village.                               
  There are artificial ponds in Althorp
Park and a large artificial lake in    
Harlestone.The bottom is of concrete   
but it is much shallower now due to    
silting.Fed by a spring the outflow is 
under an eight arched bridge.This      
outflow feeds the old mill stream.     
  An ornamental animal drinking trough 
at Harlestone was erected by the fifth 
Earl Spencer commemorating his wife.   </content>
