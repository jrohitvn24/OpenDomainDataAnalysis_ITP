		<title>02THE CHURCH IN THORNER</title>
		<content> Thorner has two churches-Methodist and
 St. Peter's Church of England church. 
{St. Peter's Church}was founded before 
 Domesday 1086. The present building   
 dates from the 15th Century. The tower
 has{William Nettleton's}gravestone as 
 its foundation.                       
 The church is licensed for funerals,  
 weddings and christenings. There is a 
 regular Sunday School, and a Parish   
 magazine.                             
 There is a regular church attendance  
 of 150 out of a population of 2086.   
{Attendance is increasing slightly,}and
 more people go to church in a         
 village than do in a town.            
 The vicar helps with pastoral problems
 and has said that the basic problems  
 of{finance and marriage}do not seem to
 change with time.                     
 No celebrities are buried in the      
 graveyard!                            </content>
