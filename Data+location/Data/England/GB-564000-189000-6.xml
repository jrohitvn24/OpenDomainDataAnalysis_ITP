		<title>06Unemployment in Laindon</title>
		<content>  A serious problem of 1985 is         
unemployment. The Basildon area has the
highest unemployment rate in South East
Essex and in May 1985 it stood at 14.7%
compared with a national average of 13%
  The national decline of manufacturing
industry is particularly worrying for  
Basildon, as 48.3% of those employed   
work in this sector. In the rest of    
Britain this averages 28.3%.           
  The problem of unemployment may well 
continue to increase. The population of
the area is still growing, and about   
1,300 people enter the job market each 
year. Even to keep unemployment at its 
present level, 5,400 new jobs will have
to be created by 1990.                 
  The A127 divides Basildon into two   
halves. To the north Billericay and    
Wickford have unemployment rates of    
6%, but Laindon averages about 16%.
