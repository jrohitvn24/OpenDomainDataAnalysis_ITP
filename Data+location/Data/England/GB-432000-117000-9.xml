		<title>09SHELLEY NURSERY:WIGLEY</title>
		<content>  Shelley Nurseries at Wigley have 2   
 working glasshouses,each covering half
 an acre of ground.One is used for     
 growing chrysanthemums and the other  
 for tomatoes.(The unused glasshouses  
 are let to Hilliers to plant trees and
 shrubs.)In winter it is not warm      
 enough in the glasshouses,so they use 
 gas heating.In an emergency,they use  
 oil.If it gets too hot in summer,they 
 have vents which are controlled       
 automatically or manually.            
  The nursery employs 6 people all year
 round and an extra person for summer  
 help.The crops are packed at Shelley  
 Nurseries,then collected by lorry and 
 sent to markets all over the country. 
 All the sales and deliveries are taken
 care of,so that the only worry for the
 workers is getting a good crop.
