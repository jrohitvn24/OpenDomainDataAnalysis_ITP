		<title>15DARTMOOR RESCUE GROUP</title>
		<content> The moor can be a dangerous place for 
 those who are not well equipped or are
 unlucky enough to have an accident. It
 is very difficult terraine in which to
 gain the attention of the normal      
 rescue services, even if you can find 
 a call box to dial 999. The North     
 Dartmoor Rescue Group has its         
 headquarters in Okehampton which      
 covers the northern part of the moor. 
 They respond to calls for help with   
 the knowledge and experience needed to
 find a casualty often in bad weather  
 or isolated places and make a         
 successful recovery. Members of the   
 group train weekly for this voluntary 
 service to those using the moor.      
 Many of their call outs could be      
 avoided if people went on to the moor 
 suitably equipped for walking in this 
 type of area.
