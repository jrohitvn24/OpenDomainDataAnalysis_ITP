		<title>03PARISH COUNCIL (1)</title>
		<content> The Parish Council, is the central    
 point in the working of the local     
 authority, although it may appoint    
 subcommittees of which at least two   
 thirds of the members must be parish  
 councillers. The council is required  
 to hold an annual meeting and to meet 
 on at least three other occasions     
 throughout the year. In practice most 
 councils meet either monthly or       
 quarterly, with occasional additional 
 meetings.                             
 The Parish Council as an executive    
 body is endowed with statutory powers,
 some of which are obligatery whilst   
 others are optional. It is expected,  
 and is often asked to voice the views 
 of the community it repersents on many
 matters eg: planning applications,    
 local plans, etc: It is also asked to 
 nominate persons to outside bodies.
