		<content>  The villages of {Ashton Keynes}and{  
{Leigh}are in{The Upper Thames Valley} 
 which consists of silts, clays, sands 
 and gravels. The sands and gravels    
 have been extracted since the 1920's. 
 They are used in concrete, blocks,    
 tiles. lintels, pipes and in road base
 construction.                         
  Industry in the area is confined to  
 mineral extraction and the building   
 industry.                             
  Large lakes have been formed in the  
 excavated areas because of the high   
 water table.  These lakes are being   
 developed as nature reserves and for  
 recreational purposes.                
  The rest of the area around the      
 villages is agricultural, with mainly 
 permanent pasture, used for dairy,    
 beef and sheep farming.
