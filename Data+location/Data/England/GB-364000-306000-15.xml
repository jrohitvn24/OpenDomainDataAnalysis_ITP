		<content> and football. The 'Travellers Joy' has
 a plaque, dated 1806, on the outside  
 wall. Within memory it was one of five
 cottages, of which only one other is  
 still standing, and sold beer by the  
 jug. Now it has a 'sixties' jukebox   
 with pictures of the Beatles . Despite
 the hanging baskets, with geraniums,  
 lobelia, and begonias, it does not    
 offer meals like the 'service' pubs.  
   The landlord of 'The Station' admits
 that he gets his living from 'the     
 food'. Over the last few years he has 
 transformed the pub from a local,     
 where men from the works would        
 congregate into a 'snacks' pub.       
 Clients come from the town centre for 
 a cheap snack and a pint. His daughter
 has just completed a catering course  
 and one of the services he offers, is 
 to 'take' meals to firms in Telford,  
 when they are having meetings etc.    </content>
