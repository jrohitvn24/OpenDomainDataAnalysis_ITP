		<title>15*Agricultural contracting***</title>
		<content>My dad is an agricultural contractor.  
He has got a contract with Burrough    
Court cutting hedges.  A contract with 
the owner of the local stud where my   
dad dics the gallops.  The gallops are 
four metres wide and a mile and a half 
round. We have to stone pick which     
means that we collect all the loose    
stones and they are used for hard core.
If we didn't pick them up the horses   
would damage their hooves. Dad also    
does ploughing hay making wood sawing, 
tree felling and lopping.  He also uses
diggers to make ornamental ponds and   
does fencing.  He also uses a drott    
which is a tractor with tracks and a   
loader.
