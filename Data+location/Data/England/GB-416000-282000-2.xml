		<content> SURROUNDING THESE COMPLEXES IS        
 FARMLAND SUCH AS DUNSTAN FARM.ALSO    
 ANOTHER IMPORTANT FACTOR IS ELMDON    
 TRADING ESTATE WHICH IS A STORAGE     
 FACILITY MADE UP OF WAREHOUSES.THE    
 AIR,RAIL AND ROAD NETWORKS MAKE THIS  
 AN IDEAL SITE FOR COMPANIES TO STORE  
 GOODS READY FOR DISPATCH.THESE MAJOR  
 ROADS ARE M42,M6 AND THE A45.IT IS    
 UNUSUAL THAT SUCH HIGHLY DEVELOPED    
 COMPLEXES SHOULD BE SITUATED ON AND   
 AROUND PRODUCTIVE FARMLAND.IT WILL BE 
 INTERESTING TO SEE IF THE FARMLAND    
 WILL BE ABLE TO SURVIVE THE GROWTH OF 
 THESE DEVELOPING INDUSTRIES.
