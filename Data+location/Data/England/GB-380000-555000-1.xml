		<title>01WELCOME TO ALLENDALE</title>
		<content> This straggling moorland haelth resort
 on the East Allen was once an         
 important lead_mining centre;now it is
 a pleasant little town,its            
 market_place and wide main street     
 decorated with trees and shrubs and   
 lined with substantial houses of grey 
 stone.On a high and steep wooded bank 
 above the river stands the Church of  
 St.Cuthbert.An unusual feature on its 
 walls is a sundial which bears a worn 
 inscription indicating the town's     
 latitude and longitude;this supports  
 Allendale's claim to be exactly in the
 middle of Great Britain.              
  A curious custom is still kept up    
 here on New Year's Eve, when 24       
 quaintly_clad men march round the town
 with half barrels of blazing tar on   
 their heads.At midnight a big bonfire 
 is lit in the market_place,and the new
 year is welcomed in.                  </content>
