		<title>18A TYPICAL SUNDAY 1985</title>
		<content>I've woken up and it's a typical Summer
Sunday. It is raining. Well at least   
I've got a cooked breakfast: Eggs,     
Bacon, Sausage, Fried Bread and Toast. 
After the meal I've got to go and get  
washed then I sit down and read the    
Sunday papers, we have the Sunday Mail 
and the Sunday People . In   today's   
papers there is nothing much           
except the usual terrorists and        
murders . We only have a light lunch   
and after that we go out for a walk    
somewhere. We end up at Oulton Broad   
feeding the ducks and the swans who    
prefer hands. When we get back I decide
to have a "bash" on Hypersports on my  
48K ZX SPECTRUM. I soon "notch" up my  
highest score "99 048". Then my brother
came in and I then let him have a go . 
At 9'0'clock I go to bed dreading some 
of the lessons to come in the          
forthcoming week.                      </content>
