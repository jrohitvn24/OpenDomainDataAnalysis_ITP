		<content>{The Vicar of Swanmore interviewed by  
{Alan:}Mr. Paterson thinks his job is  
 wonderful.  He conducts Sunday        
 services, weddings and baptisms and   
 visits the sick.  It is a 24 hour day 
 but the Bishop insists that they must 
 have four Sundays off a year and some 
 days after Christmas and Easter.  He  
 let me look at his books.  He used to 
 be a sailor.  He is involved in all   
 sorts of village and Church activities
{The Methodist Minister interviewed by 
{Clare and Emma: }Mr. Barrat looks     
 after six village churches, preaching 
 to about 38 adults each service.  He  
 has been a minister for 37 years and  
 enjoys his work.  He is on call all   
 the time, but has 48 days' holiday a  
 year.  Once he went to a hospital and 
 saw a baby dying.  He christened him  
 and he prayed that he would recover   
 and he did.                           </content>
