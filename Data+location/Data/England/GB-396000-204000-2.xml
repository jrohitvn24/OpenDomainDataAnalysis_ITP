		<content>    Most of the farming land belongs to
 the Duchy of Cornwall. The farmers say
 that the rents are high and they have 
 to use very efficient methods in order
 to survive. There are some areas of   
 land which are privately owned.       
                                       
    Mixed farming methods are used and 
 a variety of animals are kept and a   
 mixture of crops grown, thus retaining
 the appearance of traditional English 
 farming methods. Recently, the use of 
 rape as a crop has introduced a vivid 
 yellow into the spring landscape, and 
 Dutch elm disease has deprived us of  
 many beautiful old trees.             
                                       
    The introduction of mechanisation  
 means that less workers are employed, 
 and many of the old tied cottages have
 been converted into expensive houses.
