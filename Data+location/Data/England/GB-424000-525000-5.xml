		<content>      The hamlet of{Old Eldon}comprises
 of some nine houses. The largest of   
 these is the farmstead named{Eldon    
{Hall Farm.}The land is owned by Lord  
 Eldon and managed by Mr. Harrison.    
     {Eldon Hall Farm}is a substantial 
 building which, with its adjacent     
 outbuildings, possibly dates from the 
 Georgian period.                      
      The hamlet is situated on a minor
 crossroads which lead to adjacent     
 villages including Eldon, once a      
 thriving mining community.            
      The land surrounding the hamlet  
 is mainly agricultural. The majority  
 of the area is situated on broken     
 ground used for grazing, with the     
 disused Eldon Quarry used as a tip,   
 predominating the landscape. The      
 remaining fields are used as arable   
 land, crops grown include barley and  
 oil seed rape.                        </content>
