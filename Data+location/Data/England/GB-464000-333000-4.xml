		<content> The school had a bell tower used for  
 calling people to school and it was   
 rung again at 12:50 to tell people it 
 was lunch time.The school had exactly 
 the same classes and the partition    
 separating Mrs Mayor's class from Mrs 
 Storer's used to move .The only time  
 they moved the partition was to make  
 room for a stage when they performed  
 plays.                                
 In Cotgrave the post office used to be
 divided in two and the left part was a
 bake house where people used to bake  
 their bread and it would cost them    
 half a penny. The bake house was owned
 by Mrs Upton and it was closed down   
 during the First World War,but even   
 today the bake house is still there.  
 Outside our school just across the    
 road were stocks that people who were 
 bad got locked in.
