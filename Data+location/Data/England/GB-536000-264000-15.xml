		<title>15LONGSTANTON TRAFFIC</title>
		<content>   Nearly every Longstanton family has 
 a car. Two or even three cars in a    
 family is not uncommon. Nearly        
 everyone in a job leaves the village  
 daily. And Longstanton is on the route
 from Over and Willingham to the A604. 
   The result, obviously, is busy      
 roads. We counted the traffic at a    
 peak time: between 8 and 9 on a       
 weekday morning. We found 355 vehicles
 came in from Willingham, and 248 from 
 Over. 808 left the village: averaging 
 one every five seconds. And these     
 joined 3807 an hour on the A604- 2245 
 travelling towards Cambridge and 1562 
 towards Huntingdon.                   
   Longstanton drivers tell us that    
 they meet few serious hold-ups:       
 Cambridge in 20 minutes seems pretty  
 general. But it is careful nose-to-   
 tail motoring all the way.
