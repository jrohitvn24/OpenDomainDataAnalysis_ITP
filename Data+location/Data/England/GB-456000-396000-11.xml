 television. Then I went upstairs, got 
 dressed, brushed my teeth. Then mum my
 sister and me went to my grandmas.    
 Afterwards we went to town. First to  
 the butchers then into a fish shop for
 some fish. Next we went to a vegetable
 shop, then to the market. Mum looked  
 at curtains I went to the sports      
 shop. Then to Martin Raymonds followed
 by Cooplands for my dinner. Then into 
 a freezer shop we then we caught the  
 bus home. When we got home i helped my
 mum wash up. Later I split some logs, 
 mowed the lawn, put some records on

 more logs. I watched television then  
 put a video on till 10-45 and went to 
 bed.
