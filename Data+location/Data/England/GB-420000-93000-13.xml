 is built of bricks with a tiled roof. 
 In 1985 it had{307}children who were  
 divided into nine classes. The main   
 lessons given were Maths, English,    
 Spelling, Topics (Geography, History, 
 Nature), Singing and Craft. We use    
 pencil or ballpoint pen mostly. The   
 ages of the children range from{7-11  
 years old and all of them wear a      
 special uniform. The girls' uniform is
 a green and white checked dress for   
 summer and a grey skirt and white     
 blouse for winter. The boys wear grey 
 shorts and a white grey shirt.In the  
 winter when we play sport it is       
 usually netball or football and in    
 summer it is rounders, cricket, long  
 jump, stoolball and swimming. We do   
 our activities and lessons in five and
 a half hours each day.
