		<title>05The brick works in Nacolt</title>
		<content>                                       
 When we went to Nacolt we saw lots of 
 derelict houses.we went over to look  
 at one of them.Inside it there was    
 glass on the floor and bricks and     
 wood.The windows were bared up.I could
 see inside because the door was       
 open.It was a real mess inside.I could
 only just see through the windows when
 I was on tiptoe.Then we went up to    
 this dugout quarry.It used to be a    
 dugout quarry but now it is a lake.It 
 is quite big and it had trees in the  
 water.It had ducks swimming on        
 it.There are marsh frogs and great    
 spotted orchids.There are Ramond Court
 Cottages near the brick works. These  
 cottages were built in Victorian Times
 for the brickworkers and so were the  
 Naccolt Cottages. Brook School is     
 built from the bricks made at Naccolt 
 Brick Works.  The bricks are very red.</content>
