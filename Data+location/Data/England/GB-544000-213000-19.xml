		<content>  The well-known nursery of Rivers,    
 founded by John Rivers in 1725, lies  
 to the South of our area. The nursery 
 was famous for the introduction of new
 varieties of plums and damsons. The   
 firm has had a member of the Rivers   
 family involved in it, without a      
 break, for over 250 years. It is      
 claimed to be the oldest fruit nursery
 in Britain. Peach trees were first    
 planted there at about the time Nelson
 was fighting The Battle of Trafalgar. 
 In the last two years the family have 
 sold the property and it has been     
 turned into a garden centre.          
 Developers are hoping that houses will
 be built where once the fruit trees   
 grew, although this land is within    
 London's green belt.
