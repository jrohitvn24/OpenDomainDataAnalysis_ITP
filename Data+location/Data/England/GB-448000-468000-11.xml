 As far as we could tell the statistics
 from the 1981 census still hold       
 good.They show 80% of households      
 having a car and as few as 7% of      
 pensioners without access to a car.In 
 such a rural area this is partly      
 necessity,partly a sign of a good     
 standard of living.A bus does link    
 Raskelf to Thirsk,Easingwold and      
 York.Of these Easingwold is the most  
 popular for day to day shopping and   
 York for special shopping, even though
 it is furthest away at 15             
 miles.Several superstores are         
 available about 10 miles from the area
 and an irregular big visit to one was 
 thought a big reason for having a car.
