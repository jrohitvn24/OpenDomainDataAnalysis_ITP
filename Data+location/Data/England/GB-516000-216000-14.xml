		<content> Many people have a home computer but  
 only one person,each,has a C.B.       
 Radio,car telephone or metal disc     
 hi-fi. The amount of cars that belong 
 to people in Ayot village, around     
 two per family,are mainly manual. No  
 daily papers are delivered to the     
 village and the families who get      
 papers mainly read The Times followed 
 by The Telegraph,The Guardian and     
 then The Financial Times. Most people 
 shop in Harpenden for their           
 groceries. The other main place is    
 Welwyn Garden City. Many people grow  
 their own vegetables and a few keep   
 poultry. Most of the few children of  
 school age attend state schools.
