		<content>This is fairly flat farming country.   
Many hedges have been removed and      
therefore many fields are now huge with
perhaps the odd tree in the middle of  
the field marking the line of an old   
hedge.                                 
Many elm trees have died and there are 
skeletons of those which have not been 
felled.                                
The crops are barley, oil seed rape and
sugar beet.                            
The hedges are ripped into shape by    
mechanical means.  Verges are cut, when
County  Council funds allow, by the    
same means.  Because of the lack of    
main through traffic, these lanes often
remain uncut and already narrower roads
become even more 'narrow' and dangerous
because approaching traffic cannot     
truly judge the edge of the road.
