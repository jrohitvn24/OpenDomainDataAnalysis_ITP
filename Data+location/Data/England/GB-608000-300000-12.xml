		<title>12THE HEALTH CENTRE</title>
		<content>  {Wymondham Health Centre}is a large  
 new building opposite our school.     
 It was built by a Norwich firm        
 and opened on 7th February,1983.      
  The building is occupied by about    
 40 local staff, including 7 General   
 Practioners, a school Doctor, Health  
 Visitors, 2 Midwives, District Nurses,
 2 chiropodists, an orthopist, an      
 audiologist, a speech therapist, and  
 several receptionists. It is kept     
 clean by a Caretaker and 3 cleaners.  
  When we visited the Centre the Friday
 morning baby clinic was almost over.  
 We were interested in how the babies  
 were handled.On arrival each baby's   
 name,date of birth and weight was     
 recorded. As well as seeing 60 or 70  
 babies per week,doctors share the four
 surgery times each day, seeing an     
 average of 48 patients. Staff also    
 deal with emergencies at week-ends.   </content>
