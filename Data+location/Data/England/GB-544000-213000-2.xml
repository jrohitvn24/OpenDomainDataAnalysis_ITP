		<title>02SAWBRIDGEWORTH</title>
		<content>  Many of Sawbridgeworth's buildings   
 date from medieval days,evidence has  
 been found which clearly shows that   
 the first settlers came to the area   
 nearly 3,000 years ago.The name of    
 Sawbridgeworth is derived from the Old
 English of Sabrixteworde,meaning the  
 settlement beside the bridge made of  
 withies.It was first mentioned in the 
 Domesday Survey of 1086 and the manor 
 was granted to Geoffrey de Mandeville 
 by William the Conqueror.But later the
 estates were lost by Geoffrey's son in
 the 12th Century.Time has worked      
 further changes but when expansion and
 development came,the town still       
 retained its charm.
