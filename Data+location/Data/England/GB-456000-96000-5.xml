      Browndown Training Camp is a     
 barren stretch of scrub-covered       
 shingle covering a large area of      
 landscape.                            
      The earliest records of Browndown
 atthe latter end of the 18th Century  
 were of deserted heathlands between   
 the villages of Alverstoke and        
 Titchfield. At the beginning of the   
 l9th century French prisoners of war  
 made the first stop butts for a       
 musketry range. Curiously this barren 
 area was also a favourite place for   
 people ofthe district to come and kill
 themselves or others.  The last fatal 
 duel in England was fought here       
 between Lieutenant Henry  Charles     
 Moorehead-Hawkey,Royal Marines and    
 James Alexander Seaton of the llth    
 Dragoon Guards.                       </content>
