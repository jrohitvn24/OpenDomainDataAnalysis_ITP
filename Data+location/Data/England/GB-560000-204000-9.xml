		<title>09FOX AND GOOSE COOKSMILL GRN</title>
		<content> This is one of the oldest pubs in     
 Essex.It is at least 300 years old.   
 When the A414 was improved it was di- 
 verted north of the pub so the Fox and
 Goose "crossed over" the road.It used 
 to be a travellers' inn and a "local" 
 pub but now it's more like a restau-  
 rant.Most customers go there for a    
 meal,although the pub has kept its    
 licence for drinks only.The landlady  
 says that most customers are not local
 people but "passing trade" or busi-   
 nessmen.It is also a popular place for
 people from nearby towns.             
 Bad weather usually means a quiet day,
 but a sunny Sunday or Bank Holiday is 
 very busy.They work from 8.00 to Mid- 
 night with a break in the afternoon,  
 but if lunchtime has been busy,then   
 everyone has to help cook more food.At
 least 10 people are employed here with
 more casual work in Summer.           </content>
