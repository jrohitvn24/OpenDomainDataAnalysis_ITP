		<title>12A DEVON VILLAGE.</title>
		<content> In Coffinswell there are many         
 lanes.They are narrow yet still two   
 way &amp; usually steep.Often these lanes 
 are used to separate fields.they have 
 high hedges on each side consisting of
 grasses,wild roses,cowparsley,campions
 and many other small flowers.The lanes
 are not tarmaced but just worn down   
 stones.The hedges date back to the    
 middle ages and provide good habitat  
 for animals.There are many "chocolate 
 box" cottages such as are seen on     
 jigsaw puzzles etc.They have thatched 
 roofs and are usually stone washed.   
 Inside the cottages usually have low  
 roofs and wooden beams.Quite a lot    
 have lead windows.One cottage,350 yrs 
 old has a "Rumainian" thatched        
 roof.The ridge has to be re_thatched  
 every 10_15 yrs.but the roof should   
 last 50 yrs.Properties are expensive  
 because of the charm of the village.  </content>
