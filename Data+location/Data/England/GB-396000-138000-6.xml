		<title>06The Supernatural in Stockton</title>
		<content>   One of the ghosts in this area is   
 the Blue Lady. She inhabits Stockton  
 Manor.She has an unlikely story behind
 her but it could be true.A young girl 
 was said to walking to a party at     
 Stockton Manor one Christmas Eve.She  
 was wearing a blue dress.A car came   
 speeding down the drive and she was   
 knocked down.She was all right but    
 some dogs tore her apart.They  say her
 blood still stains the doorstep.Every 
 Christmas eve her ghost appears at    
 approximately 11.30 pm and then       
 disappears at midnight.All you can see
 of her is her blue head and neck. She 
 is all in blue including a blue       
 pendant. Also in Stockton there is a  
 swing which moves  by its self.A boy  
 was killed on it and ever since then  
 its been haunted.
