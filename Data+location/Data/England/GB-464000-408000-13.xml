		<title>13LIFE OF A MINER IN HATFIELD</title>
		<content> A typical miner rises at 5.00 am and  
 walks to work. At the pithead baths he
 changes into working clothes and then 
 collects his 'safety lamp' and 'self  
 rescuer' which helps him breath safely
 through poisonous and harmful gases.  
 He then goes to the time office where 
 he collects two brass discs. One is   
 handed over before going down the pit 
 and the other as he comes out. He then
 goes to the shaft side where a lift   
 takes him to the pit bottom. Then a   
 'paddy train' takes him nearer to his 
 place of work,where he works with a   
 'Dosco dinter header' which cuts out  
 roadways to develop new faces.        
 Most miners work a 7h 15m shift.      
 Although their job is dirty and       
 dangerous they soon adjust to it and  
 quite enjoy it. Their main hobbies are
 fishing, darts, and pidgeon racing.
