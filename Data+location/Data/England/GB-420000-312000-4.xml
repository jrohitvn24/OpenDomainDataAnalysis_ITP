		<title>04Edingale Church  Its History</title>
		<content>                                       
     Edingale church began as a        
chapelry of Alrewas and the great      
tithes were given to the clergy of     
Lichfield Cathedral.In the early days  
there may have been two chapels since  
the county boundary then divided the   
village.There was no mention of the    
church in the Domesday Survey 1086 but 
this proves nothing since William      
didn't ask for ecclesiastical buildings
to be counted.The first mention of a   
chapel at Edingale seems to be 1191    
when the chapel was confirmed to the   
See of Lichfield.                      
     About the year 1159 the vicar of  
Alrewas had a house in Edingale and    
from medieval times the parish was     
served by a curate.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
