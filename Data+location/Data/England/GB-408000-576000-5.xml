		<content>   The school was heated by{coke stoves
 and sometimes the children warmed soup
 on them because they had to bring     
 their own dinner to school.           
   The{school bell}rang at 9 o'clock   
 and if anyone was even one minute late
 they got the cane. They remembered one
 boy coming to school on a pony. The   
 boys, girls and teachers all came in  
 by different doors and no-one was     
 allowed to use some-one elses         
 entrance.                             
   The children were very keen on      
 singing and Mrs. Bowman showed us     
 photographs of herself in{singing     
{competitions}which Belsay often won.  
 These were held in Morpeth.           
   The boys grew vegetables which they 
 gave to the villagers. One of the     
{vegetable gardens}was where we now    
 have our mobile classroom.
