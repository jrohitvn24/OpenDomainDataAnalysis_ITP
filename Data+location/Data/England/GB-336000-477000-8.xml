 Martin's  Farm.                       
 Our farm has 47.4 ha. and a mile and a
 half of beck.  The farmhouse was built
 in 1663.                              
 Each year 35 - 40 calves are born and 
 around 25 beef bullocks are sold.     
 Our main concern is dairy cattle.  A  
 good cow can yield 8 gallons of milk a
 day, but a heifer after its first calf
 usually gives about 5 gallons.  The   
 E.E.C. milk quota, which sets limits  
 on milk production, has affected us   
 slightly.                             
 We buy food supplements from West     
 Cumberland and Preston Farmers.  Most 
 of this is in the form of cow cake and
 sugar beet.
