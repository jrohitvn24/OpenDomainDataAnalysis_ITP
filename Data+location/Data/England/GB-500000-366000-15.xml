		<content> A lot of houses in Branston are very  
 old, but a lot are new.We have some   
 cottages built in the 18th century.   
 Branston Hall was built then and      
 around it,many houses were built. Some
 of these houses still survive. Most of
 the houses in the village were built  
 since the 2nd world war. There are 3  
 new housing estates,the Valley estate,
 the High Moor estate and the Brook -  
 fields estate which is still being    
 built.Mr Taylor is building Brookfield
 and he will still be building here in 
 about 3 years time. He builds semi    
 detached and detached bungalows which 
 cost Â£23,000 to Â£24,000 and semi      
 detached and detached houses which    
 cost from Â£19,000 to Â£30,000. They are
 all made of brick. He only does 2 to 3
 bedroom houses and bungalows. Most    
 houses are owner-occupied,but there   
 are some council houses too.          </content>
