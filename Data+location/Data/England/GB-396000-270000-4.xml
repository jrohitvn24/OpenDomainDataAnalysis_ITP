		<title>04A DAY IN MY LIFE PART 3</title>
		<content> When Superman ends I switch off the   
 video and I put on Mary Poppins which 
 is on another tape. Then I leave Laura
 to                                    
 watch Mary Poppins and I go and get a 
 biscuit for myself.Then I normally go 
 outside afterwards. The house is      
 opposite the garages. In one of them  
 my bike is stored. I play on it when  
 it is a very nice day. Then I would   
 probably go to my friends house. My   
 friend is called Rosalind. We normally
 go out in the garden and have lunch.  
 Then after I have played with her I go
 home.My dad comes in at about 8o'clock
 that is when I have my bath and hair  
 wash. My dad always comes with        
 something for me so I have a lot of   
 lovely things.Then at nine o'clock I  
 go to bed.                            
                                       
                                       </content>
