		<title>13LIFESTYLE:VICAR &amp; POLICEMAN</title>
		<content>{The Vicar's Work.}We asked the Vicar  
 to describe his work.He said he is    
 very busy.His easiest day is Sunday   
 when he takes services.On other days  
 he visits people in hospital or at    
 home,reads the Bible and prays for    
 his people,and answers letters.Some   
 times he takes services of baptism,   
 marriage or funerals.He takes classes 
 for people preparing for baptism,     
 confirmation and marriage services.He 
 looks after West Looe,Talland,Polperro
 and Lansallos.                        
{The Community Policeman}told us that  
 when he joined 30 years ago he had to 
 wear his tunic even on hot days.Police
 were not as well educated.Nowadays,   
 they need to be 5'9" and need "o"     
 levels.There was no vandalism and no  
 drugs,and there was much less traffic 
 when he joined.He used to cycle,but   
 now he has a Panda car.               </content>
