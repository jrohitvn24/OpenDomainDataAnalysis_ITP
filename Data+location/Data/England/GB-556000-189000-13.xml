		<title>13SHOPPING: WARLEY, ESSEX</title>
		<content>   The main shopping area in the block 
 is a small{precinct}opposite the Ford 
 Offices at Warley, containing a bank, 
 a laundrette, a take-away food joint, 
 a butchers, a newsagent, an           
 off-licence, a hardware shop and a    
 small supermarket/general store. The  
 general appearance is windswept and   
 untidy, a design better confined to   
 the architect's drawing board. A      
 questionnaire survey of shoppers in   
 May showed that most users travelled  
 less than a mile to get to the centre,
 they mostly went there between two and
 three times a week, the vast majority 
 coming on foot. Most used it because  
 of its{convenience}to where they      
 either lived or worked. In spite of   
 the car park, few were attracted to   
 the centre by it. The most frequent   
 criticism was the lack of choice of   
 goods, together with the appearance.  </content>
