		<title>05The Population of Bramdean</title>
		<content> The total population is 402 persons,  
 of which approximately 18% are        
 children under 16. Approximately 15%  
 of the adults are retired, 53% work   
 full time outside the home, (this     
 number is almost equally divided      
 between those who work in the village 
 and those who travel outside the      
 area). Approximately 0.5% of adults   
 are unemployed.  Approximately 32% of 
 adults work in the home or are        
 students, a small proportion of those 
 working in the home also have part    
 time jobs.  The percentage of people  
 working away from the village do so   
 mainly within a radius of 10 miles, a 
 very small proportion commute further 
 afield.
