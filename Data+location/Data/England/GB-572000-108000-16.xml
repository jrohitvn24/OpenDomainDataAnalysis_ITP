		<title>16A CAMEO OF SIDLEY VILLAGE</title>
		<content>    This was a{farming hamlet}until    
 about 100 yrs ago. It contained two   
 old inns, a forge and a wheelwrights. 
 The latter two are no more. Now there 
 is a{modern shopping centre}with about
 sixty premises, around a third of them
 selling food and drink. There is only 
{one supermarket}however, and although 
 one can buy most daily needs in       
{Sidley,}none interviewed claimed to do
 all their shopping there.             
    There is a{market}held one day a   
 week which sells things cheaper than  
 the shops can, but which encourages   
{more trade}generally on a{Monday.}Some
 shops keep changing hands and there   
 were three empty in July '85. There is
 no Chamber of Commerce now.{Sidley}is 
 the area of{youngest population}and   
 most{council housing.}It also has a   
 dismantled{railway}line, axed during  
 the{Beeching cuts}of 1964.            </content>
