		<content>     2 GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO AREA.   
                                       
  The 6X4 kilometre square we have been
 given the task of surveying is to the 
 north east of a town called Devizes.  
 Devizes is a historic market town in  
 Wiltshire, with a population of       
 approximatly 10,000 people.           
  The block we surveyed is initialy a  
 rural area, but it has  a number of   
 secondary roles to play in the life of
 the surrounding area. These roles     
 include agriculture, defence, industry
 and a small area is used for          
 residential purposes.                 
  Running through the area is the      
 London road which gives direct access 
 to Swindon, the main industrial centre
 in the area. Along this stretch of    
 road, there are two petrol stations,  
 one of them has breakdown and garage  
 facilities to serve the road.         </content>
