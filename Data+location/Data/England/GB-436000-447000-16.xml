		<title>16HEALTH CONCERNS IN WETHERBY</title>
		<content> Although life expectancy has increased
 (in Wetherby in 1984 it was 68.9 years
 for males and 73.8 for females)       
 concern is growing over the general   
 health of the population. Particulary 
 alarming is the number of deaths from 
 heart disease (32.6% of male and 26.5%
 of female deaths). If all circulatory 
 system diseases are taken into account
 the figures rise to 47.7% and 48.2%.  
 The other major cause of death is     
 cancer (27.1% and 23.4%) especially   
 lung cancer. Groups such as the Health
 Council and the British Heart         
 Foundation are trying to reduce the   
 number of deaths from these diseases  
 by advocating changes in people's     
 eating habits, eg reducing the        
 consumption of fats, sugar and salt   
 and increasing the amount of fibre.   
 A reduction in cigarette smoking and  
 alcohol consumption is also encouraged</content>
