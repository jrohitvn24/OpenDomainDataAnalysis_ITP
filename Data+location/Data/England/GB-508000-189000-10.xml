		<content> Northwood and Northwood Hills are both
  on the  Metropolitan tube line.From  
 these two stations you have a choice  
 of going North to Watford or South to 
 Baker Street.It does not cost alot to 
 travel on the train,for an adult to   
 get to Baker Street it only costs     
 Â£1.40.For a child it costs Â£0.40.To be
 eligible to pay a child fare you have 
 to be under the age of 16 years.Every 
 child under the age of 16 but over 13 
 must have a child rate card to prove  
 they are under 16.the card has a small
 picture of the card holder which must 
 be shown on request by the station    
 official.Northwood and Northwood Hills
 stations have 2 platforms.one of them 
 takes the trains to Watford,the other 
 to Baker Street.The platforms are     
 situated below street level,in many   
 cases the train line has to go under  
 the road.                             </content>
