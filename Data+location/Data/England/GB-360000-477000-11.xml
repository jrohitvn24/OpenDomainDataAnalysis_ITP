		<title>11LIFE IN CASTERTON</title>
		<content> Casterton is a{small village}which is 
 very friendly and pleasant to live in.
 Newer residents comment that when they
 moved in they were made to feel very  
 welcome.Although some families have   
 lived there for many years,there is   
 some{movement of population}which     
 means that in a small village the     
{community atmosphere}can be changed.  
 The presence of girls at{Casterton    
{School}obviously gives an added       
 dimension to normal rural life by     
 their participation in{village        
{activities.}Before the school moved to
 Casterton it was housed at Cowan      
 Bridge and was attended in the last   
 century by the{Bronte}sisters.For many
 residents the lack of public transport
 is a major problem and the car is     
 essential.The village is very spread  
 out with{detached houses}and bungalows
 with large gardens.                   </content>
