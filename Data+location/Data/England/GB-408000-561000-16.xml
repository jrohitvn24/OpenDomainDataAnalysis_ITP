		<title>16PRUDHOE CASTLE</title>
		<content> Prudhoe Castle was built by the       
 Umpravilles between 1161 and 1189. The
 castle is situated overlooking the    
 river on the outskirts of Prudhoe. The
 entrance fee is 30p for adults and 15p
 for children.                         
 The castle is undergoing restoration  
 work. There is a tarpaulin over the   
 roof of the keep to shelter the       
 rebuilding work.                      
 There is a bridge by the castle which 
 is unique, it has a pointed arch at   
 one side and a rounded arch at the    
 other. By the bridge is the mill.     
 Inside is a grinding stone which      
 weighs about 2 tons. The watermill dam
 has since dried up, but the stone     
 chute is still there, covered in moss 
 and algae.
