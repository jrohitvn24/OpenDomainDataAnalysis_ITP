		<content> Much of the countryside was devoted to
 farming, the main crops being wheat   
 and barley. There are abut 8 farms in 
 the area and this includes the only   
 cattle and pig farm. Even though there
 were some woods in the area, forestry 
 did not seem like a major industry.   
 However there was some forestry near  
 Bradley Court. Also in these woods are
 the remains of a motte and bailey     
 castle.                               
    Twenty years ago there was a       
 railway from Hampstead Norreys to     
 Didcot. The M4 runs through the South 
 of the area and the A34 through the   
 West. These can be inconvenient as    
 they sometimes split a field in two.
