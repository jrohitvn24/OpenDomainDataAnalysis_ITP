		<title>12PIGEONS</title>
		<content> I have been racing pigeons for two    
 years but have worked with them for   
 nine.I am a member of the Pigeon      
 Fanciers Club in Alnwick.Every Friday 
 night I take my birds down to the Blue
 Bell Pub which is where the club is   
 based.In all,I have 100 birds. Around 
 January I put a cock bird with a hen  
 bird. Three weeks later two white eggs
 will have been laid at an interval of 
 one day .These eggs are nearly always 
 a cock and a hen bird.The chicks are  
 born featherless and yellow.After 1_2 
 weeks the young are getting their     
 feathers and arpund this time they are
 ringed on any leg. And one month old  
 they can fly .My birds race all over  
 Britain.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
