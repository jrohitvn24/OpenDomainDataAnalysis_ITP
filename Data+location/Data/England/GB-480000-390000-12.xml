		<title>12Morton Feast</title>
		<content> Morton Feast is an annual event which 
 takes place in the village at the     
 beginning of July.It starts on Friday 
 with a cross-country run.We entered 27
 runners in this year's three-mile     
 race, including our teacher Mr.Greig. 
 Our best runner came in fifth,and our 
 girls team came second in the female  
 team event.On Saturday there is a     
 five-a-side football competition.This 
 year only our girls' were successful  
 in winning a trophy.A disco is held on
 Saturday night.The boys had to take   
 their shirts off this year and show   
 their muscles.The best won a record   
 token.We played games as well,like    
 musical chairs,statues and doing      
 animal impressions.On Sunday there is 
 a cricket match and a fancy-dress     
 contest.Unfortunately it rained this  
 year and spoilt the match.The Feast   
 lasts three days and is good fun.     </content>
