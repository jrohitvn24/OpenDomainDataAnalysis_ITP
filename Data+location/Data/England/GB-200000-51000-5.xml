		<content> In 1985 there are 21, taxis belonging 
 to six firms,licensed by Restormel    
 District Council and based at         
 St.Austell Station.They pay rent to   
 British Rail for parking spaces.      
 The drivers are in contact with their 
 offices by radio telephone so that    
 requests for taxis are relayed to     
 them.They also inform the office when 
 they have a passenger and tell them   
 their destination. Most of their      
 journeys are within 3 to 4 miles      
 radius of St. Austell and many are to 
 Crinnis.                              
 They have been adversely affected by  
 the introduction of the Hoppa Buses,  
 particularly in loss of fares between 
 the town and Boscoppa.
