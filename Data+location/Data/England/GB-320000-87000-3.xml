		<content>{Beer lace}is often confused with      
 Honiton Lace.This is because when it  
 was sent off to different places in   
 olden times the boxes were marked     
 "HONITON" because they were sent from 
 Honiton to London.                    
    The most famous pieces were:the    
 dress of Queen Victoria,Queen Mary's  
 dress and the piece presented to      
 Prince Charles and Princess Diana.Mrs 
 A.Allen and Mrs Bidney were famous    
 makers of Beer Lace.                  
   Nowadays it is still made by a band 
 of village ladies.They made the Prince
 and Princess of Wales a wedding piece 
 which was in the form of the three    
 feathers and the motto"ICH DIEN".
