		<content> As my husband commutes 42 miles to    
 work each day are weekends are our    
 family time. The children swim at a   
 nearby Leisure Centre on Saturday     
 morning.My daughter rides in the      
 afternoon while we garden. Fish       
 fingers and chips is their favourite  
 tea. We all watch television until the
 children's bedtime. We enjoy a        
 relaxing meal with a bottle of wine   
 aroud 8pm. Sometimes we have friends  
 over for the evening but we rarely eat
 out in restaurants as we think it is  
 expensive.On Sunday morning my husband
 golfs while I tidy the house. The     
 children play in the garden or do     
 homework. Sunday lunch,normally roast 
 meat, is the only meal that we all eat
 together. We walk in Black Park with  
 the dog in the afternoon. After a     
 light supper the children bath wash   
 their hair and go to bed. We read.    </content>
