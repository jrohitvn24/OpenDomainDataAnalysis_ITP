		<title>11Tour of Old Warslow</title>
		<content>                                       
     Warslow used to have many more    
shops.                                 
      The house below the Middle and   
First schools was once a joiner's shop 
before it became a farm.               
     Continuing down Leek Road, the    
second house down from the Greyhound   
pub was once a local book repairer's   
shop, but that closed about 30 years   
ago.                                   
     Smithy Cottage, opposite Church   
Terrace used to be a shop selling      
sweets and tobacco.                    
     Coming back up the quarter,       
Grouse Farm was once a public house to 
which the Ecton lead miners used to    
come.  A boy used to tap dance and     
perhaps get a penny.  This was in the  
1880s and before.
