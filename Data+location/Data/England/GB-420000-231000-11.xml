		<title>11HOLIDAYS IN MORETON</title>
		<content> We visited one out of the 8 local     
 people who have guests for{Bed and }  
{Breakfast.}Six people at one time can 
 stay with her. The busiest time is    
 from June until September. Most people
 who stay are on holiday and they come 
 from all over the world as well as    
 England. She said that some people    
 from Germany come over to buy         
 antiques. The{caravan site}holds 180  
 caravans (80 can plug into mains      
 electricity). The site is open from   
 March until September.People stay in  
 caravans because of the cheapness and 
 the freedom they have. The{restaurant}
 owner said he is busiest at the       
 weekend and on{Tuesday (market day).} 
 The people who eat at the restaurant  
 are mainly tourists rather than local 
 people. Both he and the Bed and       
 Breakfast owner belong to the{English}
{Tourist Board.}                       </content>
