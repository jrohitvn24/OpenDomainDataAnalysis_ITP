		<title>18PLAYGROUND GAMES IN SOUTHALL</title>
		<content>     In our school we play{Bitthu.}We  
 have two teams with normally four in  
 each team. We play with a small ball  
 and a pile of small flat stones. The  
 stones are put in a pile in a circle. 
 The teams stand opposite each other   
 with the pile of stones in the centre.
 One person throws the ball at the pile
 of stones (if they miss three times a 
 member of the opposite team has three 
 shots) until the pile is knocked over.
 While they try to build up the pile,  
 the other team tries to hit them by   
 throwing the ball at them. The game   
 either finishes when the pile is built
 and that team then shouts "Bitthu",or 
 when all the team has been hit by the 
 ball.   ______________________
