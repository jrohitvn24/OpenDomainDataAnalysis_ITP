		<content>   I first started Wellsmead First     
 School when I was five.I learned to   
 read,write and count.There were guinea
 pigs,rabbits and gerbils.There were   
 also fish and frogs in the pond.I used
 to like playing with the sand and the 
 water bowls.There are eight classes   
 altogether and a dining room.         
   Wellsmead Middle School has nine    
 classes.Each class shares a computer. 
 We have a video,electric organs and   
 many other musical instruments.Our    
 Library is well stocked with all sorts
 of books.We are very lucky,we have a  
 large grass playing field as well as a
 hard playground and many courtyards.We
 also have a swimming pool,greenhouse, 
 overhead projector and a T.V. room    
 which is also used as a music room.We 
 have an art room where a kiln is used 
 for firing pottery.
