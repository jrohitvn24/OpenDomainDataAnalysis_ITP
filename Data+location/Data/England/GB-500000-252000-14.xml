		<content> Marbles is a game with tiny balls     
 made of glass or clay.   There are    
 different kinds like chinas, oilies,  
 clears, pearls and clays.   One game  
 we play is called "Chinese Bombers" in
 which you take one step and drop your 
 marbles on your opponent's.   If you  
 hit you win the marble.               
 "Friendsies" is when you play not to  
 win but to play for the fun of it.    
 When you play in the playground it    
 goes in different directions because  
 there are too many bumps.   So we play
 indoor on the smooth carpet by the    
 notice boards in our classroom.       
 Stuck in the Mud.   This can be played
 by any number of people.   Someone is 
 "It".   He or she chases after another
 person until they are tigged.  They   
 then stand in a shape until someone   
 rescues them by crawling through their
 legs.  They can then rejoin the game. </content>
