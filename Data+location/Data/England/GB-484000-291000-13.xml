This is a very isolated area with few  
roads. In the past the four villages   
were well served with regular bus      
services and a rail link. Today the    
railway has gone and the bus services  
have been greatly reduced. Many of the 
older ladies complained that they felt 
trapped in the village. A lot of the   
blame was put on the newcomers because 
they all worked out of the village and 
had their own transport. This has cut  
down the number of people using the bus
service which as a result meant a cut  
in service.
