		<title>03Plym valley ecology</title>
		<content> The steep_sided vally of the Plym runs
 north to south. The weather is        
 variable with similar rainfall pattern
 to Plymouth. In the sheltered vally   
 bottom the climate is much warmer and 
 the air humid. Over night and early   
 morning mists are common and billow up
 to the level of the army camp. These  
 conditions promote growth of lichens  
 ,mosses and ferns. Some flat alluvial 
 stretches near the river have rank    
 grass and rushes alternating with     
 patches ofscrub-mainly willow,alder   
 and blackthorn.The primary climax     
 vegetation of the slopes is deciduous 
 woodland,mostly oak,with a carpet of  
 woodrush and bluebells.Much of this   
 timber has been felled and replaced by
 mixed conifers planted about 35 years 
 ago.These trees now form dense forest 
 with undergrowth only in the rides    
 where brack and bramble edge the grass</content>
