		<title>13OLD BUILDINGS IN GODMERSHAM</title>
		<content> A 13C Stone Court Lodge, demolished in
 1955 is now being excavated to uncover
 the foundations of the original house,
 a chapel dating from 1289 and the     
 solar from 1313. The church of St.    
 Lawrence contains every major style   
 of architecture from 1066-1500. A 15C 
 Hall House built by Thoams Pope still 
 stands at Pope Street. Dane House     
 (1578) was the dower house to Chilham 
 Castle from 1780-1920.                
 The donkey wheel and well house beside
 Eggarton Manor is 16C and still       
 intact.  The only other working       
 example is at Carisbrooke Castle (Isle
 of wight). Godmersham Pakr(1732) is a 
 palladian style mansion with an       
 interior rich in plaster work. In the 
 grounds is a dovecote and a "folly".  
 The Great Barn (1400)later the        
 Rectorial Tithe Barn, is 121ft long   
 with a crown post at the north end.   </content>
