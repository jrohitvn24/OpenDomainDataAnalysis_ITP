		<title>19HISTORICAL HOUSES</title>
		<content> THERE STILL REMAIN MANY OLD HOUSES IN 
 THIS AREA THESE ARE MAINLY THATCHED   
 COTTAGES WHICH ARE NOT VERY LARGE.    
{SALDEN HOUSE}IS ALL THAT REMAINS OF   
 THE PALATIAL MANOR HOUSE THAT WAS     
 BOUGHT BY SIR JOHN FORTESCUE IN       
 1570.AS IT TOOK TWENTY YEARS AT A COST
 OF Â£33,000 TO REBUILD.THE LADY CECILY 
 NEVER LIVED TO SEE IT.WE SAW SOME OF  
 THE OLD WINDOWS.THE GLASS WAS YELLOW  
 AND VERY THICK WITH AGE.WE SAW SOME   
 OLD COBBLES THAT WERE PART OF THE OLD 
 FLOOR.WE WERE TAKEN OUTSIDE AND SHOWN 
 THE REMAINS OF THE ARCHES WHICH FORMED
 THE DECORATION OF THE FRONT OF THE    
 HOUSE.THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF THE       
 BOWLING GREEN AND THE OLD DRIVE WITH  
 YEW TREES LINING IT.THIS MUST HAVE    
 BEEN VERY IMPRESSIVE.NOWADAYS IT IS A 
 FAMILY HOUSE WITH ONLY TWO ACRES OF   
 LAND.                                 
                                       </content>
