		<content> promised to try to improve the        
 environment and help to create new    
 industry.                             
 In less than a 50% turnout, which was 
 probably due to the bad weather, Mr   
 Armstrong polled 2037 votes, Mr       
 Priestley 935 votes and Mr Walton     
 polled 219 votes. Therefore, Mr       
 Armstrong was re-elected for another  
 four years.                           
 Countywide the results were as follows
 with last election's results shown in 
 brackets.  Labour won 50 seats (52);  
 Alliance won 7 seats (8);             
 Conservatives won 6 seats (7) and     
 Independents and Others won 9 seats   
 (5).  This left the Labour Party very 
 much in control of County Durham for  
 the next four years.
