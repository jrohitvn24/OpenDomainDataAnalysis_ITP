		<content>   The village of Choppington in       
 Northumberland is quite small         
 consisting of a council estate, a     
 private housing estate, a few terraced
 houses, some bungalows for the        
 elderly, a school, a church, a caravan
 site and a Community Centre or Welfare
 Hall. There are only 4 small shops    
 within the village.                   
   The surrounding land is mainly      
 farmland although between Choppington 
 and the Industrial Estate at          
 Barrington land reclamation is taking 
 place. This area was once part of     
 Barrington Coal Mine. It was also the 
 area where clay was dug out for the   
 once thriving brickworks which was the
 main industry before the mines were   
 sunk. The main road which runs through
 Choppington leads north to Guidepost  
 and south to Bedlington and the city  
 of Newcastle.                         </content>
