		<title>04PONTIN'S HOLIDAY CAMP</title>
		<content>The camp covers 52 acres and was       
started in 1932 as a tented camp. These
were replaced by wooden chalets and,   
later, permanent chalets were built.   
Each chalet has a bath and shower and  
sleeps up to 6 people.  Pontin took    
over in 1958.  The camp presently      
employs a staff of 240, 1 per 5 guests.
It is equipped with modern kitchens    
serving up to 1000 meals a night and   
offering a wide range of self-service  
menus. There are ample {leisure} and   
{recreational} facilities: heated      
indoor pool, bingo, wrestling, 12      
snooker tables, table tennis, T.V. and 
cinema, a large outdoor children's     
playground, putting, miniature golf,   
walking and the beach.   The camp has  
its own linen service but no laundry.  
Security is minimal.
