		<title>13WOODFORD VALLEY ARCHITECTURE</title>
		<content>   The cottages in this area are of cob
 or an attractive checker board effect 
 of squares of flint and rose red      
 brick. They are either thatched or    
 slated.                               
   Heale House is built of brick and is
 Carolean. There are several beautiful,
 Georgian, brick built houses and there
 has been some recent development,     
 particularly in Upper Woodford, which 
 manages to blend in well with these.  
   There is a local thatcher whose     
 trade-mark is a pheasant, which can be
 seen perched cheerfully on many a     
 cottage roof. It is painted           
 realistically.                        
   This is a most favoured area and    
 whenever houses come on to the market,
 they are snapped up at very high      
 prices.
