		<content> This is a rural area with very little 
 settlement.  the south ofthe area     
 ajoins a larer reservoir which        
 supplies Leeds with its water supply. 
 Around this part the land is divided  
 into small fields each bordered by a  
 dry stone wall a feature of the area -
 and grazed by sheep and few beef      
 cattle.  Looking up the hillside the  
 grass changes from green to a yellowy 
 tussocky covering, and the fields     
 increase in size.  The walls become   
 uncared for and develop many gaps.    
 There are small woods-mainly          
 coniferous trees standing in organised
 rows. Higher up is dark open moorside 
 - the heather taking the plce of the  
 grass.  In this area rocks can be     
 seen.  Here pheasants are reared and  
 enjoy their short lives beore shooting
 parties make sport.
