		<content>In our area most people live in semi-  
detached houses. Most are made of      
concrete &amp; brick. The windows in these 
houses are large with wooden or metal  
frames &amp; an opening for fresh air. Many
houses have central heating &amp; gardens. 
People with a lot of money may have    
swings &amp; slides for their children in  
the garden. Inside the house there is  
furniture to sit on, to eat at and to  
store food in. We have many electrical 
gadgets to wash &amp; dry our clothes, wash
the dishes, prepare &amp; cook food, to    
store and keep food fresh for a long   
time. These gadgets enable people in   
the home to have more leisure time.    
Many of the floors are covered by thick
wool carpets except in the working     
areas e.g. kitchen. Most toys are made 
from plastic &amp; metal. Some have        
electrical parts. Many houses have TV, 
computers, videos &amp; music-centres.     </content>
