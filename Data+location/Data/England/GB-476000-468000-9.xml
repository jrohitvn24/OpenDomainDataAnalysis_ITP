		<content> The school opened in new buildings in 
 1963 on an open 15 acre site on the   
 edge of Norton-on-Derwent. About half 
 of the pupils come from the local     
 primary school in Norton, the         
 remainder being brought in school     
 buses from village schools in         
 Rillington,Langton,Settrington,West   
 Heslerton,Leavening,Luttons and       
 Weaverthorpe. The school has a fully  
 comprehensive five-form entry and     
 caters for pupils aged 11 to 16 years,
 sixth form education normally being   
 provided at Malton School. On entering
 the school pupils join mixed ability  
 house based Tutor Groups in which they
 normally remain for the rest of their 
 school career.                        
 The four houses provide the basis for 
 a wide range of school competitions   
 including Drama and General Knowledge 
 as well as the sports.(continued)     </content>
