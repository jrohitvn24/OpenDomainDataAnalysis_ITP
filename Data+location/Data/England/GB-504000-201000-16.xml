		<content>{SCHOOLS}_ In 1984 the Infant School   
 (built in 1838) was closed and        
 transfered to combine with the Junior 
 School in a new extension. Most pupils
 attend the Local Authority primary and
 secondary schools situated on the west
 side of the A41. Traffic patrols      
 safeguard the safety of the children  
 crossing the busy roads.              
 The Independent Rudolph Steiner School
 providing for children from primary   
 age to sixth form, occupies the site  
 of the former Royal Palace built by   
 King EDward I and uses a building,    
 known as the Priory (The remains of   
 the Dominican Friary consecrated in   
 1312) Nothing remains today of the    
 13th century Royal Palace other than  
 written evidence from archaeological  
 excavations of 1962, 1970 and 1974_76.
