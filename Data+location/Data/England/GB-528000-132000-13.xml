		<content> In the morning their routine is to    
 clean the place up, do the garden,    
 switch on the fruit machines and the  
 video games. They open from 7.30a.m to
 11.00 for breakfasts. Sometimes they  
 have people come down from Gatwick for
 breakfast as not many places serve    
 breakfast. They open again from 12.00 
 to 2.30p.m. when they serve pub       
 lunches. Evening opening times are    
 from 6.00p.m.until 10.30p.m. They have
 tried to make it a family pub, by     
 having a children's room with 2       
 electronic games, a mirror and lots of
 posters on the walls. There is also a 
 speaker which plays music and the pub 
 workers can talk to the children if   
 they want to. When we visited it      
 poured with rain and we had to paddle 
 from the children's room to the pub!  
 In the cellar the beer barrels,       
 crisps, vegetables etc. are stored.   </content>
