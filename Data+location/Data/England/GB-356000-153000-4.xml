		<content>    Pullins Dairy is one of the largest
 businesses situated in this part of   
 the Mendips. Milk is collected daily  
 from farms in Litton, Chewton Mendip  
 and Farrington Gurney. When the milk  
 arrives at the dairy it is pumped into
 bulk storage tanks, holding up to a   
 total of 7000 gallons.                
    The milk is pasteurised at the rate
 of 1000 gallons per hour and then     
 passes on to the boiling stage.       
    The bottles are filled at the rate 
 of 150 per minute. Filling is done by 
 means of a vacuum which sucks out all 
 the air inside the bottles. The milk  
 is then loaded on to lorries and      
 floats and delivered to surrounding   
 villages and towns as far afield as   
 Glastonbury and Midsomer Norton.
