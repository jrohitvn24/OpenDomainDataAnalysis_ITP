		<title>05PUBLIC TRANSPORT SEAHOUSES</title>
		<content>  The only public transport running    
 directly into Seahouses is provided by
 the United Bus Company.               
  Most buses come from Alnwick 16 miles
 away which lies on the A.1 Trunk Road 
 where they connect with main services 
 to Newcastle and the South and Berwick
 and Edinburgh to the North.           
  This service is heavily subsidised   
 and is only well used in the summer,  
 mainly by visitors, however, it is    
 essential as the only means of        
 transport for many residents.         
  Following railway closures the       
 nearest railway station is at Chathill
 (5 Miles) on the main London -        
 Edinburgh line. There are only two    
 trains in each direction daily.  For  
 those without cars a useful link is   
 provided by the relatively new Post   
 Bus Service.
