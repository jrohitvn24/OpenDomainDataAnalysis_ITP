		<title>04DEVIL'S DYKE FARM</title>
		<content> At the{Devil's Dyke Farm}(Map         
 Reference 260104)the crops that are   
 grown are Winter wheat,Spring barley  
 and kale (Cow feed).The farmer has    
 about 50 cows each worth about Â£600.  
 The cows are used for milk and the    
 milk is sold to the{Milk Marketing    
{Board.}There are no sheep on the      
 farm because of people walking their  
 dogs on the{South Downs Way}and       
 footpaths. When the cows grow too old 
 to milk they are sent to{Haywards     
{Heath Market}for meat. None of the    
 cows are bought, they are all bred on 
 the farm.The farmer buys his seeds    
 from local seed merchants. The land   
 belongs to the Crown and was used for 
 Army training during the 1939-1945    
 war. All the buildings were destroyed,
 including the disused Dyke Railway    
 Station. New farm buildings now occupy
 that site.                            </content>
