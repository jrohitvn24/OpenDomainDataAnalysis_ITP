 In Birsley Wood, there are Beech      
 trees, Japanese Larch, Sycamore       
 Lawsons Cypress, Poplar, Alder, Norway
 Spruce, Oak, Birch and Douglas Fir. At
 the NE corner of the wood is part of a
 disused railway which ran from Alnwick
 to Coldstream. It entered the block at
 the SE corner and crossed the         
 Edlingham Burn by a fine old arched   
 viaduct, then ran NW and near Hillhead
 Farm, entered a tunnel some 200 metres
 long, before crossing the Alnwick /   
 Whittingham road.                     
 About 100 acres of a large coniferous 
 forest juts into the SW corner of the 
 block, this is part of Thrunton Woods 
 owned by the Forestry Commission. This
 corner of the wood, boasts a picnic   
 area and is the starting point for a  
 number of specially marked walks.
