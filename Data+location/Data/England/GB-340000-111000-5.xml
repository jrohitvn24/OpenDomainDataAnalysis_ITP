		<title>05School Morning</title>
		<content> The school is pretty small. It's      
 got two classrooms with two teachers  
 and 30 children and it's called Hinton
 St George First School. First we come 
 in for registration. That means the   
 teacher calls our names out to see if 
 all the children are there. During    
 the morning we do reading and language
 and sometimes maths until playtime. My
 friend called Anthony and I are the   
 monitors for milk. We get the milk    
 ready for the other children to drink 
 at playtime. After having our milk we 
 go out to play in the playground.     
 Usually after play we go back to class
 and do maths till lunchtime. Then we  
 put all our work neatly in front of us
 and get lined up ready to go into the 
 dining room for dinner.
