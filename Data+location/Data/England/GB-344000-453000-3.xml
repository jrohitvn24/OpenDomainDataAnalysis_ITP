		<title>03Family Life - Sunday.</title>
		<content>One Sunday in a month our family go to 
church.We can only go once a month     
because our church is a Morman church  
in Lancaster.We have no transport of   
our own and a friend transports us to  
church.There are no buses to Glasson   
Dock on a Sunday.                      
We are mother,father and five children 
in our family. When we come back from  
church we all have a sandwich.Sometimes
my father takes me and my brother for a
walk by the shore or on the canal. We  
watch television in the afternoon. At  
about five o clock we have a hot meal. 
My mother makes the meal.My mother does
most of the work. On Sunday nights the 
children all have a bath.Dad uses the  
scrubbing brush to get us clean. We    
then have to go to bed at about half   
past seven.I say my prayers knelt by my
bedside. I enjoy my Sunday.
