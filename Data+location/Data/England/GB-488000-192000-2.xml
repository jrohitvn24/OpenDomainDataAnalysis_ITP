		<content> There are nine{churches}in the  area .
 Four were built in this century, the  
 rest are over 100 years old. The      
 oldest is{Penn Parish church}which was
 built in{1077}using local flint,      
 clunch,{Roman}bricks and even{Pre-    
{historic stones.}It stands{600 feet   
{above sea level}and the view from the 
 top of the{bell tower}can include     
{twelve counties.}On the tower is a    
{unique, blue clockface.}It has Roman  
 numerals and only one hand which tells
 the time. The Baptism font is made of 
 lead. It is very rare because of it's 
 unusual shape. One of the newest      
 churches is{St. Andrews}in Hatter's   
 Lane. It is built from brick and      
 concrete and the church is now being  
 extended. A lot of community work is  
 done there. Some pensioners who meet  
 at the church were at{St. Andrew's    
 first service 25 years ago.           </content>
