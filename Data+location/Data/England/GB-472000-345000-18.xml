		<content> Both villages entered the{Best Kept   
{Village Competition}in 1985. Syerston 
 made the finals in their category of  
 villages under 300 people.            
                                       
 The{Flintham Scout Group}recently     
 celebrated it's 10th anniversary and  
 entertained the Parish Council and    
 scouting dignatories to a buffet lunch
 in the Old School after church.       
                                       
 After years of ancient{street lighting
 which failed when it rained, Flintham 
 now has modern lighting designed to be
 in keeping with a conservation area.  
                                       
 Flintham's{sewers}are archaic and re- 
 sewerage is threatened. Although holes
 have been dug in preparation nothing  
 else is happening and the holes could 
 become permament features of the      
 street!                               </content>
