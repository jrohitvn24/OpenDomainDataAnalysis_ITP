		<title>09ALDHAM MILL</title>
		<content>  Aldham Mill wasn't a Mill with sails 
because the wheel turned instead.The   
river flowing turns the large water    
wheel,rotating cogs inside which       
eventually turned the grinding stones. 
 It was used for grain because of all  
the fields around.It's not used anymore
  Aldham Mill is no where near Aldham. 
It was built there because of the river
and it could be sold at the market.    
  The staddle stones outside the mill  
were used for keeping the grain in.The 
stones had beams on top and a barn was 
built on top so that the grain could be
kept there, without the rats getting at
it.                                    
  There is a house by the mill where   
the miller would have lived when the   
mill was used.
