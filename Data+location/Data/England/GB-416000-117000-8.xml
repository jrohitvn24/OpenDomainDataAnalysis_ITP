		<content>  I NEARLY ALWAYS WALK TO SCHOOL WITH  
 MY FRIENDS AND WHEN WE GET THERE WE   
 PLAY IN THE PLAYGROUND . USUALLY WE   
 PLAY STINGBALL, WHEN YOU HAVE TO GET  
 ACROSS THE PLAYGROUND WITHOUT BEING   
 HIT BY THE BALL.                      
  WHEN THE TEACHER COMES WE ALL GO IN  
 AND SIT DOWN AND SHE CALLS THE        
 REGISTER. SHE GETS VERY CROSS IF WE   
 TALK WHILE SHE IS DOING IT.           
  MOST OF US WEAR SCHOOL UNIFORM. THE  
 GIRLS  WEAR A GREEN  CHECK DRESS IN   
 SUMMER AND IN WINTER THEY WEAR A GREY 
 SKIRT, A WHITE SHIRT, A GREEN TIE AND 
 A GREEN PULLOVER. THE BOYS WEAR GREY  
 TROUSERS IN WINTER AND GREY SHORTS    
 IN SUMMER.                            
  OUR PLAYGROUND IS RATHER SMALL SO WE 
 USUALLY PLAY ON THE GREEN AND OFTEN WE
 HAVE TO SHARE IT WITH PONIES AND COWS.
  WHEN WE LEAVE HALE SCHOOL MOST OF US 
 GO TO THE BURGATE IN FORDINGBRIDGE.   </content>
