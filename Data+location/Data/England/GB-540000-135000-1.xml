		<content> This particular area is essentially   
 covered with rough grazing land though
 there is one complete village in our  
 block, Ashurstwood ,and the northern  
 end of Forest Row. We have            
 concentrated on issues such as law and
 order and the attitude of people to   
 such things as politics and religion. 
 Four large farms dominate the region  
 and their land takes up 65% of our    
 area.We visited a number of farming   
 locations and some work was done on   
 Owletts Farm. Our block has 3         
 different types of schools in it and  
 we studied two. Sackville School is a 
 1600 comprehensive while Emerson      
 College is a private college          
 specialising in rural studies.
