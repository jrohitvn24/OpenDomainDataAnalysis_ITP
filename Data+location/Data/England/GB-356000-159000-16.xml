		<title>16SUTTON COURT</title>
		<content> This ancient Manor House is over 670  
 years old and is at present owned by  
 Charles Townley Strachey, the 4th     
 Baron O'Hagan.Unfortunately the old   
 house is in a poor state of repair and
 is no longer occupied.Lord O'Hagan has
 plans for its restoration and a       
 certain amount of essential building  
 work has already been carried out.The 
 building is of local stone and the    
 battlemented walls around the Court   
 are considered to be among the oldest 
 walls in England.The Court is         
 surrounded by fine pasture and park   
 land.
