		<content> Of the families interviewed in        
 Glasshouses we found that about 45% of
 the people had lived in the village,or
 within 2 or 3 miles of here all their 
 lives; about 11% had come from towns  
 and villages up to 15 miles away,     
 whilst the remaining 44% of the people
 have moved into the area in the past  
 ten years from all over England and a 
 few from all over the world.          
 About 25 of the houses had only one   
 resident; 30 houses had 2 people      
 living there and 15 houses had 3      
 people in residence; there were 25    
 houses with 4 people and 9 with 5     
 people living there.  There were no   
 large families.

 had a fridge,15% had a freezer, 16%   
 had an automatic washing machine, 8%
