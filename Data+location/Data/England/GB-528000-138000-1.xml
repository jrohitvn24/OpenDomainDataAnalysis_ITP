		<content> An area of flat terrain, bordered to  
 the east by Copthorne village and to  
 the west by the light industrial area 
 of Crawley New Town and Gatwick       
 airport-the second largest airport in 
 Britain.  The area's economy is       
 dominated by these industrial and     
 airport complexes, which provide the  
 country's highest level of employment 
 in a wide variety of jobs. The main   
 London/costal railway and the M23     
 motorway bisect the area north/south. 
 This has enhanced the area as a       
 commuter belt, with people travelling 
 to London/Croydon/Brighton and beyond 
 for employment. The undeveloped areas 
 contain small livestock farms and     
 woodland.  Copthorne village is       
 expanding, with several housing       
 developments.  Bothschool and church  
 have been focal points for over a     
 century.                              </content>
