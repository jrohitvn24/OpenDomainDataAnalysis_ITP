		<title>01THE SURVEY AREA - GENERAL</title>
		<content> MOST OF THE AREA WITHIN THE GIVEN GRID
 REFERENCE CONSISTS OF AGRICULTURAL    
 LAND, FARMED BY LOCAL OWNERS OR TENANT
 FARMERS. SOME OF THE LAND IS WORKED BY
 FARMERS WHO LIVE IN VILLAGES SITUATED 
 IN SQUARES WHICH ARE ADJACENT TO OUR  
 GRID REFERENCE AND WHO CONSEQUENTLY   
 WERE NOT INTERVIEWED BY US.  THE      
 LANDSCAPE UNDULATES, FORMING A NATURAL
 VALLEY IN WHICH IS SITUATED PITSFORD  
 RESERVOIR FORMED BY THE CONSTRUCTION  
 OF AN EARTH-FILLED DAM.  THE SOLE     
 CENTRE OF POPULATION IN THE DESIGNATED
 AREA IS THE VILLAGE OF PITSFORD, BUILT
 ON THE CREST OF THE HILL. THE SITE OF 
 THE ORIGINAL VILLAGE AS RECORDED IN   
 THE DOMESDAY BOOK IS A LITTLE LOWER   
 DOWN THE HILL WHERE A TOLL-GATE       
 COTTAGE IS THE SOLE SURVIVOR OF THE   
 FREQUENT FLOODS WHICH PROMPTED THE    
 CHANGE OF LOCATION TO A MORE SENSIBLE 
 SITUATION IN THE 17TH CENTURY.        </content>
