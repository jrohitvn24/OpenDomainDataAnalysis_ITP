		<title>13A Saturday on the Farm</title>
		<content>        by Sharon Holloway (Aged 10yrs)
 I wake up with my sister Rachael,     
 after we have dressed we go into the  
 kitchen with our Mum and Dad it is    
 5.00 am .We have a cake and a drink of
 orange squash.At 5.10 am Rachael goes 
 up the farm and washes the parlour    
 down while I get the cows in.When they
 are in Dad gets the cow cake ready for
 the calves. Rachael feeds four calves 
 I feed two calves while Dad beds them 
 up .Next we fill a wheelbarrow with   
 silage which we give to the calves.   
 When we go in Anne, my little sister, 
 is awake we play with her then we have
 breakfast at 8.30 am. Dad comes in at 
 9.00 am.We go out to play until dinner
 at 1.00 pm.We usually play horse      
 jumping. After dinner we play in our  
 hut which is an old chicken hut on    
 wheels.Dad has been cleaning the yard 
                                       </content>
