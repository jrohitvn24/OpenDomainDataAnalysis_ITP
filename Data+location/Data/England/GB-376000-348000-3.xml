		<title>03THE OLD RAILWAY LINES</title>
		<content>The old railway lines,or "LINES" as it 
is known to the locals was first opened
on 24.7.1870.Most of the trains were   
owned by the North Staffs Railway Co.In
its day the railway was busy carrying  
coal and iron stone from local mines   
and passengers into Newcastle-u-Lyme.  
In the early 1900's Silverdale Iron    
Works closed and in the 1930's the iron
works at Apedale closed losing a lot of
business.Passenger traffic also dropped
and the double line was reduced to a   
single in 1934/5.More local collieries 
closed and forced the line to close in 
January 1963.                          
The lines today have been converted    
into a walkway streching from Halmerend
opposite the school,to Bignall End. The
track is made of red ash and the old   
railway embankments are covered in wild
flowers,brambles,bushes and small trees
or just grass.                         </content>
