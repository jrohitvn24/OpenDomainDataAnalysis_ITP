		<content>IN ADDITION TO THE LARGE SHOPPING      
CENTRES IN OUR AREA,THERE ARE SEVERAL  
LOCAL PARADES OF SHOPS LIKE THOSE AT   
MOTSPUR PARK AND THE PLOUGH,MALDEN     
ROAD.                                  
A SURVEY OF THE FIFTEEN SHOPS AT THE   
PLOUGH WAS UNDERTAKEN TO FIND OUT IF   
THEY WERE USING MODERN TECHNOLOGY IN   
THE DAY TO DAY RUNNING OF THEIR SHOPS. 
IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THREE OF THE    
SHOPS USE A COMPUTER FOR STOCK ORDERING
WHILST TWELVE USE MODERN EQUIPMENT SUCH
AS CALCULATORS AND ELECTRONIC TILLS TO 
RUN THEIR SHOPS.                       
RESEARCH ALSO REVEALED THAT LOCAL      
PEOPLE USED THIS SMALL PARADE OF SHOPS 
EVERY DAY,PROVING THAT THESE SHOPS ARE 
CONVENIENT AND USEFUL TO THE RESIDENTS 
OF OUR AREA.
