		<title>13GRAFFHAM POLICE</title>
		<content> Our local policeman has a car in which
 he patrols his 'patch'. He must check 
 that people have a fire-arms licence  
 if they own a gun. He must help the   
 people to make sure there are no      
 burgularies. Our liaison officer loves
 working with children. He trained for 
 3 months &amp; had 2 years practice. He   
 visits 36 schools altogether. He      
 teaches us about safety at home, road,
 &amp; farm. He reminds us to be careful on
 bonfire night &amp; warns us about being  
 friendly to strangers. Sometimes      
 mothers ask him to speak to their     
 naughty children. In secondary schools
 he speaks to the older children about 
 driving cars, riding motor cycles, the
 stupidity of drinking &amp; driving &amp; the 
 taking of drugs.
