		<content> THE VITAL COLOSTRUM AS YOU PROBABLY   
 WOULDN'T KNOW,BUT THIS IS VITAL TO A  
 NEW_BORN CALF.IT WARDS OFF ANY BUGS   
 THAT THEY MAY HAVE,BUT HE             
 HAS DONE QUITE WELL WITHOUT IT.SO WE  
 ARE KEEPING OUR FINGERS CROSSED ON    
 HIM.THIS BIG CHAP HE DIDN'T HAVE      
 QUITE SUCH A GOOD START IN            
 LIFE,BECAUSE HE HAD A VERY LONG       
 BIRTH.AS YOU CAN SEE HE IS QUITE A BIG
 BOY,HIS LUNGS TOOK QUITE A PACING,AND 
 HE'S HAD PNEUMONIA QUITE A FEW        
 TIMES.AT THE MOMENT WE'RE KEEPING OUR 
 FINGERS CROSSED THAT HE'LL NOW        
 OVERCOME IT AS HE'S NOW MUCH          
 LARGER,BUT TOMORROW HE'LL PROBABLY    
 HAVE A TEMPERATURE AND THEN IT WILL BE
 ANTIBIOTICS.BUT THE THING IS WE TEND  
 TO LOOK ON THEM MORE AS PETS.         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
