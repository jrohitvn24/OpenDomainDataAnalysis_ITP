		<content> At the top of Ochrewell Avenue there  
 is a Police Box.  I once had my bike  
 stamped there.  There are police cars 
 and vans going in and out all day.    
 Outside this there is a bus-stop.     
 Further down at the side of it there  
 is a Post Office and at the side of   
 that there is an Off-Licence.  At the 
 top of that road, there is a Chinese  
 take-away and a Newspaper shop.  There
 is also a phone-box.  Most of my area 
 is covered in housing but there are   
 some fields at the back of the        
 bungalows which run along the bottom  
 road. We have a graveyard but men are 
 removing the remains to move elsewhere
 so that they can build something else 
 on the site.  We have a dentist, a    
 video shop and a supermarket.         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
