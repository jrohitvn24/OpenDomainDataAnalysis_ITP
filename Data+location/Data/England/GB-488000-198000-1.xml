		<content>   Little Kingshill is a small village 
 in the Chilterns. It has a school,a   
 chapel,two pubs,a scout hut and a     
 cricket club. Various groups meet     
 regularly in the Village Hall,such as 
 the W.I.,Brownies,Guides and the      
 Gardening Club. There are no shops in 
 the village but a small garden centre 
 opens in the summer months.           
   The area is rural despite being     
 within easy access of London. Many    
 people commute to the Capital or work 
 in the neighbouring towns of Amersham,
 Chesham,High Wycombe or Aylesbury.    
   The Chiltern Hills are very popular 
 with walkers and ramblers.Many people 
 come here to use the numerous public  
 footpaths and enjoy the countryside.  
  The nearest station is Gt. Missenden 
 with a regular service to London,but  
 buses are less frequent and most      
 people are dependent on private cars. </content>
