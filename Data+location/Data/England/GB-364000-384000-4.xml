		<title>04BRADLEY HALL, DAIRY FARM</title>
		<content> Bradley Hall dairy farm is located at 
 Grappenhall near the junction of the  
 A5O and M6, just North of the M56.    
 Three people work on the farm, the    
 farmer, his brother and one hired     
 person.                               
 The farm is 67.4 hectares in area.    
 The land is gently undulating and the 
 soil is heavy clay with some loam.    
 The land is drained by Bradley Brook  
 and no artificial drainge is used.    
 The farmer improves the soil by       
 putting cow manure and fertilizer on  
 it.                                   
 The livestock consists of 161         
 Freisian cows, 1O Murray Greys, and   
 2 Murray bulls.  The Murrays are      
 mainly for showing, but the main      
 income on the farm is from milk       
 production.
