		<title>09EMPLOYMENT AROUND BURGHFIELD</title>
		<content> Although agriculture and estate work  
 were probably the original sources of 
 employment in the Burghfield Common   
 area,most of the development of the   
 village has been due to post-war in-  
 dustries.In particular,the Atomic     
 Weapons Research Establishment (AWRE) 
 at Aldermaston,and the Royal Ordnance 
 Factory (ROF) in Burghfield,provide   
 work for a large proportion of the    
 community.Many local mothers work     
 part-time at these establishments.    
  Information Technology is another    
 important industry for the residents  
 of the area,which is situated in the  
 so-called "Silicon Valley",a hi-tech  
 region spreading from London to west  
 of Reading.Many people commute to     
 local towns or London to work with    
 electronics- or computer-based firms. 
 In a survey,over 50% of fathers of 10-
 11yr.olds worked in Reading or London.</content>
