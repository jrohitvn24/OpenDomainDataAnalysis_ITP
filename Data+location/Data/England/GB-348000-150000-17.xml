		<title>17RODNEY STOKE NATURE RESERVE</title>
		<content> Stoke Woods are located on the S.W.   
 slope overlooking Rodney Stoke and    
 the Somerset levels. Because these    
 woods are rich in both flora and fauna
 they were declared as a National      
 Nature Reserve in{1957.}The total area
 of the Reserve is 35 hectares and it  
 is owned by the Nature Conservancy    
 Council. The Reserve consists of two  
 wooded spurs with a small dry valley  
 between. The woods used to be coppiced
 but were mostly felled during the     
 1914-18 war and West Wood was again   
 felled during the 1939-45 period.     
 Hence the trees in West Wood are      
 younger than those in East Wood.      
 Temperature extremes are{-7'C}to{30'C 
 and annual average rainfall is about  
{1000}millimetres. Permits are         
 required to enter this Reserve.
