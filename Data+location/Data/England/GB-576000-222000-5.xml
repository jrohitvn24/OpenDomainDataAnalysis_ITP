		<content>{The East side of Braintree has a      
 variety of housing stock. Two         
 particular housing styles stand apart.
 Both were commissioned by families who
 had important industrial interests in 
 Braintree. The older houses were built
 by the Courtauld family. They have a  
 distinctive style which can be found  
 in other parts of Braintree and North 
 Essex.They are imposing solid houses  
 of red brick, exposed timber facades  
 and narrow leaded light windows.      
 The newer houses were built by the    
 Crittal family. Their striking        
 features are their flat top roofs,    
 angular streamlined facads and,       
 uniformity. They were built along the 
 lines of industrial housing where the 
 house is made in parts offsite.
