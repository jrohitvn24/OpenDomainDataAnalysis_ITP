		<title>10LEISURE TIME</title>
		<content> We interviewed 11 people to find out  
 how they spent their leisure time. We 
 foundthat gardening is the most       
 popular hobby for people whe lived in 
 our area. None of them go to sports   
 centres .In the tweleve KM. squares   
 and the most popular sport was horse  
 riding and a lot of people went       
 swimming in their spare time.Reading  
 was quite popular too.Some of the     
 children play tennis go bike riding   
 and play  hockey. Football and rugby  
 were very popular in the hobby        
 section. Only one person went to a    
 sports centre some people just watch  
 the sport they like on television.    
 Television is the most popular leisure
 activity  for children.Many people own
 cats and dogs ,and walking the dog    
 accounted for a lot of leisure time.
