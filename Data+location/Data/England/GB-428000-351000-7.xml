		<content> THE ONLY SECONDARY SCHOOL IN THE AREA 
 IS THE ANTHONY GELL SCHOOL. IT HAS    
 BEEN A COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOL FOR 20    
 YEARS BEING BUILT ON THE SITE OF THE  
 GRAMMAR SCHOOL. THE CURRENT           
 HEADTEACHER IS MR.R.PEARCE WHO HAS    
 ENCOURAGED THE GREATER USE OF THE     
 SCHOOL AND ITS FACILITIES BY THE      
 COMMUNITY, SO MUCH SO THAT THERE IS A 
 LOCAL NEWSPAPER RUN FROM THE SCHOOL,  
 ART AND CRAFT EVENTS TAKE PLACE,      
 SPORTS TOO. ADULTS ARE ENCOURAGED TO  
 TAKE PART IN EXAMINATION LESSONS TO   
 FURTHER THEIR OWN EDUCATION. MANY OF  
 THE THEATRICAL AND MUSICAL EVENTS FOR 
 THE AREA TAKE PLACE AT THE SCHOOL. THE
 SCHOOL IS RUN BY DERBYSHIRE COUNTY    
 COUNCIL.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
