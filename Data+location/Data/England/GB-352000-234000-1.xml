 Dinedor Camp was originally an{Iron   
{Age hill fort.}  It covers            
 approximately ten acres, and          
 rises about 400 feet above the        
 surrounding countryside.   It is quite
 separate from the other hills         
 surrounding the city of{Hereford}and  
 can be seen quite clearly whichever   
 way you approach it.   The Iron Age   
 men who made their home on it chose   
 the best place in the neighbourhood to
 live as they had a very good view all 
 around.                               
 There is only one path up to the top  
 now, and some of the earth ramparts   
 that the people who lived there built 
 can still be seen.
