 I enjoy swimming a lot. I am a member 
 of Avonbourne School Swimming Club run
 by Miss Bones and Miss Cannan. Before 
 I went to swimming club I was afraid  
 to go out of my depth but now I have  
 gained confidence and I am able to go 
 to the deep end. I have gained my 25  
 metres and my 50 metres badges.

{Drama}                                
 I belong to a drama group at the      
 Boscombe drama centre, it is on       
 Saturdays at 10am to 12 o'clock. I    
 enjoy it very much, I have been in one
 production "Charlie and the Chocolate 
 Factory" and I was Mr Salt.           
 I was very nervous at first but       
 afterwards I enjoyed it and I was very
 pleased with my performance.
