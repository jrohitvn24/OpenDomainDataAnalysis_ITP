		<title>16HEADCORN'S BUILDING MATERIAL</title>
		<content> Many of the houses in the area display
{typical Wealden characteristics}of    
 style and materials. There are several
 very fine examples of{half-timbered   
{Tudor houses.}Yeomen's houses with    
 main beams of Wealden Oak and with    
 wattle and daub infilling of hazel.   
 The foundation courses are of brick or
 stone. The{smaller cottages}of the    
 18th. and 19th. centuries are usually 
 weatherboarded. Local timber was used 
 and is now white painted. Roofing is  
 of locally made clay Kent peg tiles.  
{The Parish Church}and the older part  
 of the{Primary School}are of Kent     
 Ragstone and Bethersden Marble. The   
 former is a sandstone from the ridge  
 to the N. and the latter a fossil     
 bearing conglomerate. There are also  
 many{cottages and larger houses}built 
 in red brick from the old Pluckley or 
 Frittenden works.                     </content>
