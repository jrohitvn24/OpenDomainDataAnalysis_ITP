		<title>08RETIRED HEADMASTER EDGMOND</title>
		<content>   20 years ago, Mr Wase,now 85,retired
 as a headmaster. He bought his house  
 in 1960, he and his wife renovated it 
 to their liking. He told that the part
 of Edgmond that includes the Church,  
 Rock Lane, Pond Lane, Provost's House 
 and Manor Road can be considered as   
 "The Old Edgmond", but now there are  
 many new estates. The Church is 900   
 years old and it plays an active part 
 in the community of Edgmond,          
 Traditional Services are held and many
 activities are linked with it. A house
 in Rock Lane, which was built in 1574 
 was a Youth Hostel and is now a       
 Private House.                        
   There used to be an old language in 
 Edgmond but no one speaks it now.     
 Other organisations include           
 T.O.C.H., Mothers Union, Senior Social
 Club. There is Entertainment eg.      
 Talks, Holiday Slides, Outings.       </content>
