		<content> Through the area flows the River Goyt.
 To the North of the block this has    
 been dammed to make two reservoirs to 
 provide water for Stockport.The Goyt  
 Valley to the North of Whaley Bridge  
 is very beautiful and is a popular    
 tourist attraction but as it reaches  
 Whaley Bridge it becomes very polluted
 from industrial effluent.             
   The 2 other reservoirs in the area  
 were built as feeders for the canal.At
 one time the canal terminus at Whaley 
 was linked to one at Cromford by a    
 tram and later a railway line.The     
 remains of this can still be traced.  
  The school is situated in the part of
 Whaley known as Horwich End.Botany    
 Mill here now bleaches cotton.        
   There is a mixture of old and new   
 houses in the area parts of which used
 to be mined for coal.There is little  
 industry here now.                    </content>
