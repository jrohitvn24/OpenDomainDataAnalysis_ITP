		<title>09  ILFRACOMBE GOLF CLUB</title>
		<content> Ilfracombe Golf Club was founded in   
 1892 on land acquired near Mullacott  
 Cross.This land was good pasture and  
 the grass grew too quickly,so many    
 golf balls were lost.At the turn of   
 the century it moved to the present   
 site at Hele,where the rough land was 
 more suitable.The site covers about 90
 acres and has 18 holes.There are      
 almost 500 members.Besides the adult  
 section there is an active junior     
 section.There is a club professional. 
 In recent years the club house has    
 been extended.It now provides the     
 professional's shop,changing          
 facilities with showers,a dining room 
 and bar and a flat for the full time  
 steward whose wife does the catering. 
 Improvements have been made to the    
 watering system to the greens in 1984.
 One of our teachers is a very keen    
 player and gave us this information.  </content>
