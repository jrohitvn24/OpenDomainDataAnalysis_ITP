		<content> dual purpose of replacing woodland and
 forming a windbreak, but the keen     
 winds have made it difficult for the  
 saplings to establish initial growth. 
      At Fulling Bridge Farm Mr. Bush  
 has replaced woodland and created a 5 
 acre lake with islands by damming a   
 small river valley. The lake is stock-
 ed with trout, but other fish, notably
 tench and roach have established      
 themselves in great numbers. On the   
 farm itself the waste drainage system 
 has been designed so that the water is
 recycled over the land to avoid the   
 pollution of the streams and lake. In 
 front of the farm an old water meadow 
 system has been preserved.            
      At Lower Dunge Farm the medieval 
 moat is an official preservation area.
 Consequently it is a flourishing wild 
 life haven. The area inside the moat  
 has not been officially excavated.    </content>
