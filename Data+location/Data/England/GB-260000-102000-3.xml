		<content> I live at Coxwell Farm, which was     
 mentioned in the first Domesday       
 Book.This is a day in my life.        
       I get up at 7.45 and get ready  
 for school,while dad is doing the     
 milking.While Janet and I are         
 at school,dad works on the farm,mum   
 does the housework,my sister Helen    
 works in a shop in Okehampton.        
   When I get home I change and go to  
 feed the Guinea pigs and rabbits.I let
 out my Bantams.They are like small    
 hens,they lay two to four eggs a      
 day.Some are black, one is ginger,    
 three are grey.I also have a Silver   
 Dorking cockerel and seven chicks.    
 When dad comes in from mending hedges 
 or making silage,we have our tea.Dad  
 milks the cows again while we play or 
 watch television.I lock up the hens   
 against the fox. Then I go to bed and 
 read for a while before I go to sleep.</content>
