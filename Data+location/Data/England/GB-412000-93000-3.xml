		<title>03THE FLOODS IN CHRISTCHURCH.</title>
		<content> In 1980 at{Iford}there were           
 floods.This does not happen very often
 unless there are heavy rains the day  
 or night before.This has only         
 happened a few times when the{River   
{Stour}gets too much water in it and   
 causes it to overflow.Lots of houses  
 that were nearby got flooded.There was
 one house where there was an old lady 
 and man asleep.They didnt wake up in  
 time and they had to be rescued.In    
 some cases new houses had to be       
 built.You had to swim up the road to  
 get out.People had to buy new beds new
 curtains and all new furniture        
 including new carpets.The river is    
 down at Iford.As I said before it does
 not overflow very often.              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
