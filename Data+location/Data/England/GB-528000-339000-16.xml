		<content> The{Candlemas Supper}is a delicious 5 
 course meal enjoyed by 80 members of  
 the two Frampton churches. One person 
 is chiefly responsible for the        
 cooking. The young people serve the   
 meal.The identity of the cast in the  
 pantomime which follows is always a   
 closely kept secret. The production in
 1985 was "Who's Been Stalking" which  
 included the appearance of a 3m giant!
{Frampton Gardens Open Weekend}was at  
 the end of June when 11 gardens were  
 open to the public on Saturday and    
 Sunday afternoons. Teas were served in
 the garden of Cotton Hall. Programmes 
 at Â£1 with a printed route gave       
 admittance to all 11 gardens. The     
 event raised Â£800+ for church funds.  
 Other events include Whist Drives,    
 Beetle Drives, Jumble Sales, Sausage &amp;
 Mash Supper and a Wine Tasting.
