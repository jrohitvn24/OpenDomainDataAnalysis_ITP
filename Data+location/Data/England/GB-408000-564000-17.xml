  As far as we are aware, few former   
 Wylam residents have ever been called 
 obituaries in the times paper! But the
 late Basil Bunting, a poet who lived  
 on Elm Bank Road during the 1970s,    
 did so with a substantial entry       
 following his death on the 17th April 
 at the age of 85. The quality of his  
 poetry was not widely recognized until
 the mid-1960s, but in recent years the
 critics have regarded him as one of   
 the finest living English poets. Wylam
 is pleased to have him as a former    
 resident.
