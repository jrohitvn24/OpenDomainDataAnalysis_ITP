 Yalding has long been an important    
 bridging place of the rivers Beult and
 Medway. Roads B2010 and B2162 carry   
 much traffic through Yalding including
 heavy lorries to and from Paddock     
 Wood. Bow Bridge, Wateringbury carries
 a minor road. On B2015 Wateringbury &amp; 
 Nettlestead have Maidstone-Tunbridge  
 Wells traffic. Most families have a   
 car. The Strood-Paddock Wood line     
 serves Wateringbury &amp; Yalding railway 
 stations. The daily hourly electric   
 trains in each direction are augmented
 on Mondays to Fridays in peak hours.  
 Passengers change at Paddock Wood and 
 Strood for main line trains. Sunday   
 services start slightly later and     
 finish slightly earlier. There is     
 through freight traffic, but none to  
 or from Wateringbury or Yalding       
 stations.                             </content>
