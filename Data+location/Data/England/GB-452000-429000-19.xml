		<content> Mrs. Joan Scott lives at 6 Orchard    
 Drive,Hambleton.She has worked for the
 Royal Society for the Prevention of   
 Cruelty to Animals for 20 years on a  
 voluntary basis.At the moment she is  
 caring for a large white rabbit,some  
 cats and a baby Kestrel.A man in      
 Thorpe Willoughby was gardening,when  
 the kestrel landed on his head,he     
 walked inside with it still there,and 
 got in touch with Mrs.Scott.We saw    
 Mr.Scott feeding it rabbit meat.The   
 rarest animals she has looked after   
 are a fox,ferrets and a Pyrennian     
 Mountain Dog.These were also the most 
 interesting cases.She enjoys her job  
 very much even though she is paid     
 nothing but she has won 2 awards,one  
 was worth Â£1000 with this money she   
 has built a well equipped cattery.
