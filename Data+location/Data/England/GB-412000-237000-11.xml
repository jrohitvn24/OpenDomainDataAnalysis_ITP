		<title>11BUILDING</title>
		<content> The planners have placed limits around
 Campden and Broad Campden outside     
 which building may not take place.    
 This has placed very heavy pressure on
 the available land within the limits. 
 The High St.houses had gardens which  
 stretched to Back Ends, now for the   
 most part built on and that within the
 last ten years. The Parish Council    
 fear that further development in this 
 area will spoil the country lane      
 aspect. The new housing is being built
 for the most part by speculative      
 builders who do not follow the rules  
 evolved over generations therefore the
 houses look out of place,the materials
 used are unsympathetic, and in order  
 to take a profit there are two many   
 houses crammed into too small a space.
 The local people are concerned ,they  
 feel that the unique atmosphere of    
 Campden is being destroyed .          </content>
