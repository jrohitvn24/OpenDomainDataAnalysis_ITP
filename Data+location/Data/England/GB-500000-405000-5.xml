		<content> have their premises in this hundred   
 yard long street and the Trustees     
 Savings Bank is the sole bank.  At the
 eastern end of the street the cinema  
 has been replaced by a group dwelling 
 for the elderly and the former police 
 station now houses the magistrates    
 clerk's offices, the courtroom        
 remaining in its original site.  A    
 residential home for elderly people in
 need of care is situated at the very  
 end of the street where the workhouse 
 once existed.  There are a few empty  
 properties including a disused        
 congregational chapel but two         
 saddlers, an art shop and craft shops 
 help to retain Brigg's links with the 
 past as a market town.
