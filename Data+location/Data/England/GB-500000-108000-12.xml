		<title>12VILLAGE LIFE IN SOUTH STOKE</title>
		<content> 'Life's quiet in a weekday, hectic    
 weekends though, tourists parking all 
 over. I couldn't live anywhere else,  
 not in a street. A car's vital mind,  
 no shops, no deliveries. School? Taxi 
 fetches the child. Easy living here,  
 me being a carpenter, but we'll have  
 to leave when I can't drive any more. 
 We're economical, grow the veg.       
 collect wood, almost live for nothing.
 Problems? Once a year about twenty of 
 us have a parish meeting, thrash thing
 out! I'm not a christian - wouldn't go
 to church elsewhere, but here - it's  
 a friendly society, smoothes things.  
 Undercurrents? Well, we have          
 difficulties - take the man who won't 
 have his dog neutered - our bitches   
 are in trouble see! Festivals? Well   
 there's Harvest when they come up     
 river by boat from Arundel. Villagers 
 must fit in, obey the rules like.     </content>
