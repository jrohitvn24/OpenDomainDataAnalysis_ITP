		<content> The children are up with their father 
 and see him off to work, I am usually 
 up and about by 8 o'clock, checking   
 that they have had their breakfast and
 that my son has had a wash, contact   
 with soap and water is not high on his
 list of priorities at the moment. By  
 8.15am. they have left for school. I  
 switch on the washing machine, prepare
 my breakfast and try and watch the    
 8.30am. news on Breakfast Television. 
 I then shower and change and make sure
 the beds are made, venturing with     
 great trepidation into my daughters   
 room, her promise to 'keep it tidy'   
 hasn't been kept, nine times out of   
 ten it resembles a church jumble sale,
 with piles of clothes everywhere. I   
 make a mental note to remind her of   
 her promise, yet again!
