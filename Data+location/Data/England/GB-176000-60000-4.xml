		<content> A{Barrow}lies on the end of Pentire   
 Head.  A Barrow is a burial place for 
 an important Bronze Age Person.       
 There has been a settlement and       
 church in Crantock for over 1200      
 years.  It grew as a fishing port and 
 boat repair centre but the estuary has
 sanded up in recent years. The village
 has grown with retired people.Our     
 retirement ages at present are 65 for 
 men and 60 for women. West Pentire has
 evidence of{early settlement.}The     
 Bowgie Pub in Cornish means cow       
 shelter.  Treago farm is mentioned in 
 the 1086 Domesday Book.  Kelsey Head  
 has the remains of a{cliff castle}at  
 least 300 years old.  Robert described
 it as a big place with a wooden fence 
 and a stone wall, each with a gateway.
 The 2 gates were never in line in     
 order to make entry difficult
