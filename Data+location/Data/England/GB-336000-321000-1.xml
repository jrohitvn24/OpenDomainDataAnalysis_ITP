		<content>{Ruyton of the Eleven Towns,}once a    
 borough town, is now a parish and     
 village of 1,000 inhabitants. In the  
 middle of the 12th Century the 3      
 manors of Ruyton, Wykey and Felton    
 were united to form 1 manor of Ruyton 
 comprising 11 townships namely Coton, 
 Eardiston, Haughton, Rednal, Shelvock,
 Shotatton, Sutton, Tedsmore, West     
 Felton,Wykey and of course, Ruyton.   
 All eleven still appear on ordnance   
 survey maps but possibly now only as a
 farmhouse. To the East of the village 
 flows the River Perry which marked the
 boundary between medieval Shropshire  
 and the Marcher land of Wales. It is  
 said that any Welshman found on the   
 eastern side of the River Perry was   
 slain on sight.                       
 All that is left of the castle is a   
 fragment of, possibly, the base of the
 square tower.                         </content>
