		<title>03The People</title>
		<content> Originally the majority of the people 
 worked on farms but since the advent  
 of mechanization etc.there are no     
 longer many farm workers, most of the 
 work being done by the farmers        
 themselves and their families.        
    Consequently the population fell   
 but quite a number of city workers    
 decided that they would like to live  
 in the country and to assist them the 
 Carlisle City Council decided to make 
 Smithfield into a development         
 area.Stage 1 of this plan has just    
 been completed in 1985 with the       
 building of just over 30 houses and   
 bungalows on Ryehill Park Estate in   
 Smithfield.Quite a number of other    
 city workers have bought country      
 properties in the villages of         
 Hethersgill, Scaleby and Scaleby Hill 
 this has tended to restore and        
 increase the local population.        </content>
