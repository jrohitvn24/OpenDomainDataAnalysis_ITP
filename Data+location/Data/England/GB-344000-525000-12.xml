		<content> Home of the Hasell Family,Dalemain is 
 a most attractive house with a fine   
 Georgian facade of pinkish_grey       
 ashlar,situated about half amile from 
 the village and faces the River       
 Eamont.                               
 Sir Edward Hasell bought the estate in
 1679,his son added to the house its   
 East front and sides in about         
 1740-50.Most of the West wing is much 
 older,probably 15th or early 16th     
 century;it incorporates a former tower
 and a newel staircase and a large     
 medieval Hall.The tower is probably   
 another of the line of the pele towers
 to which Dacre Castle belongs.The     
 house is owned by the McCosh Family   
 direct descendants of the Hasell      
 Family.The house is open to the public
 during the summer,about 16000visitors 
 per season.There is a licensed        
 restaurant,shop,museums and deer park.</content>
