		<title>13   A FARM IN CHURCH FENTON</title>
		<content>   {Church End Farm}is an{arable farm }
 of 250 acres.                         
    The soil varies,near the village   
 it's sandy, further south is clay.    
 Crops grown are wheat,barley,oats,    
 potatoes and peas.                    
    Potatoes are sold in bulk and peas 
 are sold to Kings Lynn.               
    To drain each acre costs Â£750 and  
 pot or plastic pipes are available.   
 Both will silt up in time.            
    Now the only animals on the farm   
 are pets but he hopes to buy beef     
 cattle.                               
    Machines are combine harvester,    
 tractor,plough and potato sorter.     
    Two men help Mr Boddy,his future   
 plans are to knock down farm buildings
 and build bigger ones for cattle.     
    His only problem is lack of water  
 and the water authority won't let him 
 install an underground water system.  </content>
