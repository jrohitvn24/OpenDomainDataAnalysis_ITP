		<title>08The Animal And Bird Garden</title>
		<content>   The Animal and Bird Garden was      
 opened in May 1983.They chose this    
 area because many people come to walk 
 on the Malvern hills and the Gardens  
 offered another interest for them.The 
 Gardens are open every day of the year
 except Christmas day.There are 100    
 different species of animals and birds
 .The most expensive a black spider    
 monkey costing Â£1,600.Strict safety   
 precautions are taken,the animals are 
 brought from zoos in different parts  
 of the world,not wild from the jungle.
 All dangerous animals are caged but to
 keep interest,visitors are encouraged 
 to handle snakes and get as close as  
 possible to most creatures.           
  They had difficulty getting          
 permission for the Gardens many people
 didn't want it because they were      
 afraid of animals escaping,but today  
 they've won support of the locals.    </content>
