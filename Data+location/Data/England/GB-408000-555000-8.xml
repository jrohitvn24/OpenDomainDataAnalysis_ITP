		<title>08A Factory Worker.</title>
		<content> I work night-shift at Marley Tiles    
 from 8p.m until 4a.m.There are certain
 jobs which must be done every night in
 order for the factory to run the      
 following day.The most important of   
 these jobs is in the{Batching Plant.} 
 This is where the sand and cement are 
 mixed to make the tiles.The finished  
 mix is called{Pug.}The pug is mixed in
 a large pan shaped mixer.Inside the   
 mixer pan is a device called a{Spider.
 This consits of zinc steel arms .There
 are steel paddles attactched to three 
 of these arms and the other three hold
 a steel bracket to which are fixed    
 three steel fingers called{Tines.}    
          When the pug is being mixed  
 it builds up on the tines and paddles 
 and it is my job to make sure these   
 are cleaned for the following day.My  
 average wage is Â£85 per week.
