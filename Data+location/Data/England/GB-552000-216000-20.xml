   The text of the foregoing pages has 
 been compiled from material researched
 and written by eight to eleven year   
 old pupils of St. Mary's Primary      
 School, Hatfield Broad Oak.           
                                       
                                       
   Our thanks are due to many local    
 people who have generously given of   
 their time and expertise and patiently
 answered our questions. We are also   
 indebted to the authors of numerous   
 books and pamphlets (many of which are
 no longer in print) from which we have
 drawn many of the facts we have used.
