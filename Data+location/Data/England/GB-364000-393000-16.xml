		<title>16Attitudes In Culcheth</title>
		<content>    We surveyed the parents or         
 neighbours of the 23 children in our  
 class, who live in Culcheth. Most     
 people seemed to think Culcheth was a 
 good place to live. 19 people thought 
 there were enough shops; others wanted
 more childrenswear shops. 17 people   
 felt that there were enough parks and 
 open areas. The same number agreed    
 that Culcheth is tidy.                
    Over 3/4 of the people interviewed 
 were pleased that there were lots of  
 motorways nearby, but 13 people       
 thought that there should be more     
 buses.                                
    18 people were happy to stay in    
 their present house, the rest would   
 have preferred to live in other parts 
 of Culcheth.                          
    Some thought that the amount of    
 traffic was becoming a nuisance;it was
 getting harder to park at the shops.  </content>
