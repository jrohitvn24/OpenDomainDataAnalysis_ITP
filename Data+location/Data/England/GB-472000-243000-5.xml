		<title>05Potterspury Church Belltower</title>
		<content> At one end of St Nicholas Church,     
 Potterspury is a square stone tower   
 containing six bells. The oldest of   
 these was made in 1480. The bells are 
 worked from the ground floor by ropes 
 going through the ceiling. Up one side
 of the tower is a stone spiral        
 staircase and this leads right up to  
 the roof. On the first floor in the   
 tower you can see an extremely fine   
 clock mechanism worked by heavy       
 weights which have to be wound up once
 a week. In the actual bell room you   
 can see the six bells with their large
 wooden wheels by their side. The bell 
 can also be rung by metal strikers if 
 there is only one bell ringer. In 1985
 the top part of the tower was restored
 and many fund-raising events have     
 taken place to raise money for the    
 project including a sponsored 'Hush'  
 by the school children.               </content>
