 The original primary school was opened
 in 1906. The village grew and a       
 separate Junior Dept. was opened in   
 1968. The first building became the   
 Infant Dept. where there are now 108  
 children in 4 classes.                
 The Junior building has 6 classrooms  
 with 180 children. We have a library  
 where we find out things from books.  
 In the hall we do P.E., watch TV. and 
 have lunch. We have 2 large           
 playgrounds where we skip and play    
 ball. Most children learn to swim in  
 our swimming pool. We have a large    
 playing field at the top of the bank, 
 with woods on the far side. At        
 lunch-time the kitchen provides about 
 50 meals and 100 children bring pack  
 lunch.
