 there are terraced houses with blocks 
 of two story flats set in the middle  
 of them.  {                           
{MANSIONS}The only Mansion House in the
 district was Hale Hall, which is now a
 ruin and overgrown with creepers,     
 briars, and trees.{                   
{FARMHOUSES}There are still a few      
 operational farmhouses in th district 
 although some of the others have now  
 been converted into residences for the
 local population. {                   
{OWNER OCCUPIED}A number of the council
 houses in the area have been offered  
 for sale to the sitting tenant, and a 
 number of them have now or are taking 
 this opportunity to purchase their    
 property which is offered to them at a
 much reduced rate, and to alter or add
 extensions to them.
