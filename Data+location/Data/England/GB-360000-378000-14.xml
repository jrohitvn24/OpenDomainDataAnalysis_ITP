		<content> There are four public houses in our   
 D-Block.Their names are The Chetwode  
 Arms, The Birch and Bottle, The Mill- 
 Stone and the Antrobus Arms.  The     
 Chetwode Arms has been an inn for over
 400 years,and served for centuries as 
 a coaching stop on the main Shrewsbury
 Road. The stables are still being used
 as storerooms. Originally the name was
 "The Cock of Whitley" until Sir John  
 Chetwode renamed the house around l700
 after his family, as it was then part 
 of the estate. The Millstone used to  
 be a windmill and the house next to it
 was built for the miller. Austin Wood-
 vine is the Landlord, they sell beer, 
 spirits and wine. It has always been  
 called the Millstone.It was built in  
 l890.The Birch and Bottle has 12 to 14
 people on a part-time basis. The Land-
 lord is Ian Holt.The Antrobus Arms    
 changed its name from The Wheatsheaf. </content>
