		<content>  The{fourth year}children held a      
 traffic survey on{Abbey Rd.}It started
 at{7am}and finished at{7pm.}The       
{weather}was very cold. There was{snow 
 on the ground but the{road was clear. 
  During the day about{4,500 vehicles  
 passed our checkpoint. Of these{4,310 
 were cars. The{busiest}times were     
 around 8am and 5pm. We think this     
 is because people were going to and   
 from work.                            
  Between 8am and 8.15am 200 cars      
 passed our checkpoint. Between 5pm and
 5.15pm 185 cars passed. A total of 385
 cars in these two periods.            
  The{peak for commercial vehicles}was 
 between 1pm and 1.15pm with a total of
 21 passing. At 9am, 12 noon and 3.30pm
 about 120 pedestrians were recorded.  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
