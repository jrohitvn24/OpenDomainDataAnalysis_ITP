 The village of Raskelf has firm       
 connections with hunting.In the       
 Domesday Book Raskelf is spelt Rascill
 and is often pronounced like this     
 today.The name of the village can be  
 traced Ra (roe deer) and skelf (shelf 
 of land).This implies that roe deer   
 would have been found upon the ridge  
 where Raskelf now stands.When Richard 
 III was living in the castle at       
 Sheriff Hutton he hunted at           
 Raskelf.Today hunting is still a      
 pastime enjoyed and encouraged by some
 people in the area. It has been quite 
 widely hunted by the York and Ainsty  
 hunt.Few people expressed opposition  
 to this kind of hunting though whale  
 hunting was less popular.
