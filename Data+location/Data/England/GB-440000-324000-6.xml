		<title>06Donington Sunday Market</title>
		<content> Until very recently a regular open-air
 market was held, on Sundays, on land  
 belonging to the owner of Donington   
 Park Racing Circuit. It was well      
 supported by both traders and the     
 public with the latter travelling from
 many parts of the East Midlands.      
 The future of the market is, however, 
 uncertain as a temporary injunction   
 banning the market is in force. This  
 injunction came into force after a    
 Trading Association from a nearby town
 complained of loss of trade.
