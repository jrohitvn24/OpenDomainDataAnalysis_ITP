		<title>16RECREATION AREAS</title>
		<content> In our survey we had the opportunity  
 to find out about the different       
 Recreation and Leisure areas that the 
 people in Harbury visited.  From our  
 questionaire 80% of those asked,      
 ranging from children to adults, went 
 to the local playing fields.  People  
 said that they went here to relax and 
 enjoy themselves for there was a play 
 area of swings and slides, a tarzan   
 swing and logs, an extensive grassed  
 area for different sports (and to     
 exercise the dog) with two tennis     
 courts.  The average travelling time  
 to the area was approximately 5       
 minutes due to the central location   
 and on average people stayed between  
 one and two hours at a time.  It was  
 used more often in the Spring and     
 Summer months.
