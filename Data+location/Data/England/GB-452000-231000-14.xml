		<content> Croughton CofE (Controlled) Primary   
 School is housed in a new school      
 opened in 1977.  The previous stone,  
 thatched building was built in 1886,  
 and had become impractical for modern 
 educational practice.  It now houses  
 the village playgroup and the Rural   
 Schools Educational Project, set up to
 help enrich the scope of the syllabus 
 in rural schools. The Primary School  
 currently has 34 on the roll, and a   
 staff of Headmaster, Infant teacher   
 and a part timer.  A cook produces    
 meals on the premises. Certain events 
 of the school year, such as the       
 Christmas Plays, are focal points for 
 the older members of the community.   
 After the age of 11, most children    
 attend Magdalen College School,       
 Brackley. A few under 11's go to      
 school in Brackley; some ten village  
 children are educated privately.      </content>
