		<title>03NOTTINGHAM-MY RELIGION</title>
		<content>     My religion does not allow me to  
 eat meat that is not{"halal".}"Halal" 
 is{specially prepared meat.}At school 
 we have meals which do not contain    
 meat - but we can eat fish.           
     We practise our religion at home  
 and at{the mosque.}The mosque is near 
 our home, in the J.I.P.A.C. centre. My
 brothers and sisters go to the mosque 
 most days, for 2 hours after school.  
 They go to{learn}to read{the Kuran.}  
 The Kuran is the Muslim bible.At home 
 we{speak}both{Punjabi}and{Urdhu.}The  
 Kuran is written in another language  
 which we are learning to read. I think
 it will take me a long time before I  
 will understand it.                   
     We all have our own{prayer mats}at
 home. We have to learn many prayers by
 heart. We should{pray 5 times a day - 
 when we are at school we pray at 5    
 a.m.,12 noon, 5 p.m., 9 p.m. &amp; 11 p.m.</content>
