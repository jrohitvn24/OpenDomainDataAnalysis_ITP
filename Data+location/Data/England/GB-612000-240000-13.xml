		<title>13Sport survey, 7-11 year olds</title>
		<content>A survey in one of the local primary   
schools showed that 75% of the children
took part in active sport out of       
school. The most popular sports were   
swimming and football. 85% of the      
children made use of local sports      
centres and 70% made use of sports     
centres elsewhere in the town.         
Sport is mainly undertaken by the      
younger members of the community. How- 
ever the 167 households surveyed in the
area showed that 53% of the sample had 
members of the family engaged in active
sport. This suggests considerable adult
participation.                         
The area is well served with a wide    
variety of sports facilities, but the  
nearest swimming pool is in the town   
centre.                                
                                       
Survey made in Downing C.P. School.
