		<title>01A SUMMARY OF THE AREA</title>
		<content> The area varies from being very urban 
 in the N.W. to rural in the S. and E. 
 This results in a very interesting    
 variety of subjects to study. The area
 includes a great variety of housing   
 from the very old farms to new modern 
 estates. We have an industrial estate 
 and a large factory- Sterling Metals. 
 We have both farms for animal rearing 
 and crops. The Coventry Canal runs    
 through the area, as does the Wem     
 Brook, which is a tributary of the    
 River Anker. The area is steeped in   
 history. There is, for example The    
 White Stone,which marks the stopping  
 place on the old coaching route from  
 Nuneaton to Lutterworth. To many      
 people, the most famous person who is 
 associated with the area is George    
 Eliot. One of the local schools is    
 named after the famous novelist.
