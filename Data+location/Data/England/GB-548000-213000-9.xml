		<title>09The Maltings</title>
		<content> The{Maltings}stands beside the river. 
 100 years ago it must have been a very
 pleasant sight as barges unloaded     
 barley and loaded up with barrels of  
 salt or cargoes of wood.Now the       
{Maltings}have almost closed working.  
 Instead many of the buildings have    
 been altered and small firms have     
 taken over parts of them, making it a 
 mini-shopping estate.  Carpet         
 warehouses, bathroom equipment,       
 antiques, tyre sellers and wine       
 merchants all compete with each other.
 The goods no longer go by river but by
 road; a continuous stream of traffic  
 is always turning into or out of the  
 main road bringing customers or       
 equipment to keep these places        
 provided with stock.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
