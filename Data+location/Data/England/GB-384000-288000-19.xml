		<title>19Life in Wall Heath [2]</title>
		<content>Wallheath is very near Kingswinford    
which is in the South of the West      
Midlands.It is also on the edge of the 
greenbelt and on the border of         
Staffordshire.My house is on the main  
road through Wallheath(A449).I go to   
Summerhill High School.There are also  
two primary schools,Maidensbridge CP   
and Ascension Church School.I am the   
first generation of my family to grow  
up in Wallheath.My dad comes from      
Netherton,which is a few miles from    
Wallheath,and my mom from Sheffield.   
Dad met her while at Sheffield         
University.The shops in Wallheath are  
scattered but are mainly near the cross
or on the main road.My mom does most of
her shopping at the shopping precinct. 
Shops seem to have a job staying open. 
The Co-op has closed and the other     
supermarket is always closing down and 
reopening.                             </content>
