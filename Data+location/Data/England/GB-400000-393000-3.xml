		<title>03A GLOSSOP FAMILY DAY OUT</title>
		<content> The {Doyle Family }: if we are going  
 out for the day we rise at 8.30am. get
 dressed and have a good breakfast.    
 On this Sunday morning we set off for 
 church just before 11am. and after the
 service set out for our destination by
 car.    On this particular occasion we
 had decided to go to {Holmefirth}, now
 famous for making the TV comedy series
{Last of the Summer Wine.}    We walked
 through the town and found some of the
 places used in filming, such as {Sid's
{Cafe. }After a stroll we went to Sid's
 Cafe to sign the visitors' book which 
 is left on the counter.      We looked
 through the pages, finding that people
 from far away, like {America,}had come
 to see our {local }place of fame.     
 After a satisfactory day out we headed
 for home to prepare for work or school
 the next day.                         
                                       </content>
