		<title>09SCHOOLS NEAR KIRKBURTON</title>
		<content> I started at Highburton First School  
 when I was 4 years old. I liked Topic 
 lesson best because it was interesting
 I liked the school because all the    
 children and teachers were friendly.  
   Now I am at Kirkburton Middle       
 School.We start here at 10 years old  
 and stay for 3 years. I like this     
 school because there are a lot of     
 different subjects and a lot more     
 friends to play with.                 
   When I leave I will go to Shelley   
 High School.You can leave there when  
 you are 16 or stay on until you are   
 18. If you leave at 16 you can go to  
 Technical College or go to work.I     
 think I will go to Technical College. 
   The Special School is right next to 
 our School. Some of us visit their    
 school and some of them come to us. I 
 think that is a good idea because they
 can be mixed with other children.     </content>
