		<content> Many pheasants and partridges can be  
 seen in the fields . Wild rabbits,    
 haresm hedgehogs, squirrels, molesand 
 field mice are common. Bird life is   
 extensive; common sparrows,           
 blackbirds, thrushes, crows, yellow   
 hammers, kestrels and magpies. The    
 footpaths in this area are not        
 signposted due to a decision by the   
 Parish Council and are gradually being
 lost due to lack of usage. Opposite   
 the Hadingham's farm there is a pond, 
 wired off to the public and like the  
 dykes and ponds found on either side  
 of the Rushmere road they are green   
 with algae. Very little other life    
 exists in these waters probably due to
 fertilizers running off the fields.   
 The hedgerows are a very attractive   
 feature of this area with their wide  
 verges full of grasses and beautiful  
 wild flowers. Mnay have been removed. </content>
