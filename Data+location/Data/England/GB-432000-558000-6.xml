 The Nissan Motor Companies first U.K. 
 factory is under construction between 
 Sunderland and Washington on the site 
 of Usworth Airport.                   
 Production of cars is scheduled to    
 begin in August 1986 with 24,000      
 cars.50% of the initial 100 management
 staff are local people.  In phase two 
 production will increase by 1990 to   
 100,000 cars per annum with 80% E.E.C.
 content built by 2,700 employees.     
 Japanese management personnel have    
 arrived with their families.  Their   
 children are attending local schools  
 and interest has been stimulated in   
 Japanese culture.  This is reflected  
 in the factory dedication ceremony of 
 DARUMA.  This is a traditional 15th   
 century Japanese ceremony of          
 persevering to overcome obstacles and 
 achieve objectives.                   </content>
