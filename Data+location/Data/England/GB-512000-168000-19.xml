		<content>  {In Percy Road,}near the gate of     
 Hampton Junior School{is an old       
{grating on which are the initials     
{"G.J.W.W."} This stands for the Grand 
 Junction Water Works which was one of 
 the three first water companies that  
 set up pumping stations in Hampton in 
 1854.                                 
  {In the Upper Sunbury Road there is  
{an archway on which is written        
{Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company. 
 This was another of the original      
 London water companies that came to   
 Hampton in 1854.  The original        
 buildings, although now only used for 
 storage are "listed" and are at       
 present being restored.               
  {On Platt's Eyot is a large hill     
{which was created when the soil       
{excavated during the constuction of   
{the filter beds in 1899 was dumped.
