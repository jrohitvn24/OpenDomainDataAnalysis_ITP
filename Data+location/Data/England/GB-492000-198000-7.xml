		<title>07Birdwatching</title>
		<content>   Going on holiday to the coast is a  
 real treat for me. It is lovely to see
 all the seabirds. One thing you will  
 need to be a succesful birdwatcher is 
 a pair of binoculars. A good pair of  
 binoculars will cost about Â£13.       
   I go birdwatching as often as I can.
 There are many good birdwatching huts 
 around the country, and even if you   
 can't see any birds it's nice to see  
 the countryside. When you are watching
 a bird and you want to get closer for 
 a better look you should always follow
 these rules:                          
 1) Creep up silently and slowly.      
 2) Do not get too near the bird.      
 3) Sudden noises will frighten birds. 
 4) Never pick up an egg from a nest   
 and put it back because your scent    
 will cause the mother to neglect it.  
 5) A bird may mistake a pointing      
 finger for a gun.                     </content>
