		<title>18FARMING IN MARSTON VALE</title>
		<content> FARMS ARE MOSTLY ARABLE WITH BARLEY   
 AND WHEAT BEING THE MAIN CROP.        
 SUGAR BEET AND OIL SEED RAPE ARE BASIC
 ROTATION CROPS WITH RAPE INCREASING IN
 POPULARITY. THERE ARE SMALL AREAS OF  
 POTATOES,BEANS AND PEAS BUT NO        
 HORTICULTURE OR GLASSHOUSE PRODUCTION.
 THE AREA HAS TWO MILKING HERDS OF 120 
 PLUS COWS AND A FLOCK OF 350 PLUS     
 SHEEP. GRASSLAND PRODUCTION IN GENERAL
 IS STATIC-IN AREA EXCEPT EXTRA LAND   
 BROUGHT IN AGRICULTURE FROM EXHAUSTED 
 CLAY PITS. THERE IS A SMALL LIVESTOCK 
 MARKET IN BEDFORD AND A LARGER ONE IN 
 NORTHAMPTON. MOST SMALL FIELDS HAVE   
 BEEN OPENED UP INTO LARGE AREAS WITH  
 TRACTOR POWER IN EXCESS OF 240        
 HORSE-POWER.TRACKED VEHICLES ARE USED 
 ON THE HEAVIER SOILS. THE AVERAGE     
 MANPOWER ON LARGE ARABLE FARMS IS ONE 
 MAN TO 500 ACRES. AGRICULTURE EMPLOYS 
 A LOW PERCENTAGE OF LOCAL WORK FORCE. </content>
