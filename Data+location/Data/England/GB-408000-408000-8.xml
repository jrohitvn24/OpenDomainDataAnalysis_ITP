		<content> A Report from the Holme Valley Express
 of 17/5/85: Mr Peter Middleton,the    
 headmaster of Meltham School,hit back 
 at suggestions that a school swimming 
 pool could be used by the public. Mr  
 Middleton was replying to suggestions 
 made at an annual Meltham Town        
 Council meeting that the pool should  
 be thrown open to the public."The     
 design made it unsuitable for leisure 
 use by either secondary age children  
 or adults.Perhaps Mr Hilton,who made  
 the suggestion, would like to visit   
 the school to see the pool for himself
 before making further erroneous       
 comments," he added.Twenty years ago  
 the school amenities committee raised 
 the money to build a learner pool as  
 an extra facility for the school with 
 no financial help from the then West  
 Riding Authority.
