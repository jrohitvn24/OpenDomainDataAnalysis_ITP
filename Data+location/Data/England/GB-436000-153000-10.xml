		<title>10THE GEORGE AND DRAGON</title>
		<content> There used to be six pubs in          
 Hurstbourne Tarrant, but now there is 
 only one, the George and Dragon which 
 faces the crossroads.                 
 It was a coaching inn, and in the     
 lounge bar, there is still evidence of
 this. A small{kneehole desk}which     
 formed the parcels office faces the   
 car park where the stables used to be.
 Parcels were handed in through the    
 window. The{letter rack}(where both   
 outgoing and incoming letters awaited 
 collection) forms the mantleshelf of  
 the inglenook fireplace.              
 A small window facing the road was a  
 bar for customers who stayed outside. 
 The area around the window is shelved,
 and there is a bottle opener set into 
 the frame                             
 A restaurant now occupies a room      
 once used as a cycle shop.
