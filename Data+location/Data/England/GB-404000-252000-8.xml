		<content> The farm consists of 3 main           
 enterprises, a fruit farm, a 'Pick    
 Your Own' arrangement and the farm    
 shop. The fruit farm grows apples and 
 pears for market in Leicester and     
 Northampton. There are about 80 acres 
 of eating apples. These apples are    
 picked, sorted and put into cold      
 storage until market prices are good. 
 The trees are replaced every 12 to 15 
 years. There are 40 acres of cooking  
 apples. The varieties grown are       
 Bramley, Howgate Wonder and Early     
 Victoria. The 'Pick Your Own'         
 area has 30 acres of strawberries,    
 about an acre of tomatoes, an acre of 
 sweetcorn and the same of beetroot, an
 area of raspberries and a small area  
 of peas.The farm shop sells fruit,    
 vegetables and eggs produced on the   
 farm. Mr and Mrs Beach rent the farm  
 from the Marquess of Hertford.        </content>
