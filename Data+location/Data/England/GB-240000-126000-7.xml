		<content> Probably the greatest change in land  
 use for at least one hundred years is 
 now taking place in this area. A new  
 road, an extension of the A39 Taunton 
 to Fraddon is now cutting a swathe    
 through farms and woods. A            
 continuation of the Barnstaple By-pass
 the new Torridge Bridge and Bideford  
 By-pass, it is due to be opened in    
 Spring 1987. Realignment of existing  
 roads and a massive fly over in the   
 Kenwith Valley are involved. It is    
 doubtful whether as much human        
 activity has taken place in that      
 valley since the Saxon King Hubba     
 fought the Danes there in the 9th     
 century.                              
 A low power independent television    
 relay station exists to serve low     
 lying areas  of Westward Ho!
