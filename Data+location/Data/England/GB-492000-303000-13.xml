		<title>13Rutland Sailing Club.</title>
		<content> Set on the southern bank of Rutland   
 Water are the buildings of Rutland    
 Sailing Club. The club caters for     
 sailing and non-sailing members many  
 of whom travel considerable distance  
 to sail. A number of different classes
 sail from the club but the only motor 
 assisted craft are rescue boats. The  
 club has been the host to a number of 
 major sailing events.                 
 Facilities at the club house include  
 accomodation for residential courses  
 in sailing and also school and youth  
 group visits for environmental and    
 nature studies.                       
 The Club maintains a small permanent  
 staff but provides further casual     
 employment at weekends and when club  
 facilities are at high demand.
