<title>24Changes at the Churches</title>
<content>

The Parish Church is still very active onder the leadership of the Priest in Charge, Rev Lorraine Summers, the first woman incumbent. A large wall hanging was created as a community project to celebrate the Millennium and the Millennium Room was created.&lt;br />&lt;br />The decision to close the Methodist Church was taken in 2008. It is now being converted into a private dwelling, under the constraints of the Conservation Area, by a local couple.&lt;br />&lt;br />The Roman Catholic Mass in the Parish Church has been discontinued.   &lt;br />
