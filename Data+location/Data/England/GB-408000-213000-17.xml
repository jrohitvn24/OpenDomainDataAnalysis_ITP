		<title>17GOVERNMENT- TOWN COUNCIL</title>
		<content> There are 7 men and 2 women sitting on
 the Council, mainly professional      
 people.They stand for election every 3
 years by the rate payers of Northleach
 . Meetings are monthly, the public    
 attend but can only speak at the      
 annual meeting which provides a       
 useful exchange of views. Decisions   
 are taken by a voting majority. Their 
 power is limited but is not           
 decreasing in the town. They do       
 however steer away from controversial 
 views. They are financed by rates and 
 have been rate capped to 5%. Finance  
 is the limiting factor for their      
 plans. Their responsibilities include:
 street cleaning and lighting, main_   
 tenance of the cemetery, paying the   
 clerk and giving permission for events
 to take place in the town centre. With
 the recent bypass, a major achievement
 ,the council see many opportunities.  </content>
