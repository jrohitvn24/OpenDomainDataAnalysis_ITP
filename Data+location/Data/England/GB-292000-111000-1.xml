		<content> The main town in our area is Tiverton.
  It has a population of about 16,000. 
 It stands at the point where the River
 Exe meets the River Lowman.  It has   
 got several Factories but it is not   
 really very industrial.  In the middle
 of the town there is the Market Place.
  There are several parks in the town  
 and it is surrounded by hills and open
 countryside.  Some of us still think  
 that the town is smelly compared with 
 the country!  There are many council  
 houses.  These are on estates around  
 the edges of the town.  Most of the   
 shops and older buildings (eg the     
 Castle and St Peter's Church) are in  
 the centre of the town.               
 A new Link Road joins the town to the 
 M5 Motorway in the East but to the    
 West the roads are much smaller.  They
 run through land used mainly for beef,
 dairy and sheep farming.              </content>
