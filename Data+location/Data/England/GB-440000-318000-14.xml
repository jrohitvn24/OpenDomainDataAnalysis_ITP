		<content> No doctors have a{surgery}in the      
 village.When people are ill they have 
 to go to the doctors surgery in other 
 places.Sometimes doctors call to see  
 patients.In a sample 38 of familys    
 40% had Dr. Jolly (Belton)            
  9% had Dr. Graham(Coalville)         
  4% had Dr. Lee   (Coalville)         
  4% had Dr. Church(Ashby)             
  4% had Dr. Baker (Coalville)         
  4% had Dr. Divigher(Coalville)       
  4% had Dr. Speedle(Ashby)            
  4% had Dr. Hoffman(Ashby)            
 If villagers need to go to{hospital   
 they go to Leicester,Burton or Derby. 
 Also there isn't a{dentist}in the     
 village so they go to Ashby,Coalville 
 or Loughborough .The school dentist   
 comes to the school once a year to    
 look at the children's teeth.
