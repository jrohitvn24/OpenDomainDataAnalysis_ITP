		<content>  The church which has stood on the    
 same site for 900 years dominates the 
 cross roads ,once it was a very busy  
 shopping area with a cobblers, a beer,
 a tailors, a blacksmiths, a grocers   
 and a bakers shop.                    
    There is still a sign of the beer  
 shop ,an old house called the Red     
 Lion, even the old dame school has    
 been converted into a house.          
    The one shop which has remained is 
 called Rogate Stores with its little  
 Post Office tucked inside where people
 can get their pensions. It provides a 
 valuable meeting place for village    
 folk besides giving many a passing    
 motorist a chance to do some quick    
 shopping.Unfortunately it is closed at
 the moment as it has gone bankrupt but
 probably someone will buy this        
 thriving business.
