		<content> We noticed a big difference in the    
 amount of traffic using one of the    
 lanes in the village, compared with   
 the traffic along the main village    
 road "The Street" and the A429 link   
 road between Malmesbury and           
 Chippenham. On a very wet afternoon we
 recorded the traffic using these      
 three roadways in a given half hour   
 time. Our count showed that 6 vehicles
 used Hill Hayes Lane; 33 vehicles used
 The Street,(through the village) and  
 207 vehicles passed along the A429. We
 found that most vehicles were private 
 cars; 5 out of the 6 in Hill Hayes    
 Lane; 18 of the 33 along The Street   
 and 176 of the 207 on the A429.Of the 
 total from all three counts (246), 61 
 were lorries and vans, and 5 included 
 bus,coach and minibus transport.One   
 tractor used The Street.
