		<title>05FARMING REPORT IN BOLTON</title>
		<content> Mr Roberts, his wife and 2 children,  
 farming at Bank House farm for the    
 past 14 years, have worked hard to    
 improve the standard of their 100     
 acres of grazing land. Previously the 
 land was used as an open cast mining  
 site and when the top soil was        
 replaced it was not entirely suitable.
  Now the quality of their grass is    
 good enough to enable cows to produce 
 good milk and calves to be reared     
 successfully. The farm has 150 cows   
 but no bulls; artificial insemination 
 is used instead.Farmers cannot allow  
 themselves to become attached to new  
 calves as all males are sold at 12    
 months.  Mr R. works 7 days a week    
 without holidays but feels that       
 working in the countryside is worth   
 the disadvantages. His greatest dread 
 is that the coal board will reclaim   
 his land but he remains optimistic.   </content>
