		<title>12BUILDING STYLES IN NE LEICS</title>
		<content>  Most buildings in the area are       
 private houses or farm buildings      
 constructed of red brick or marlstone 
 rock, a sandy coloured stone used     
 abundantly in the Rutland area.  Some 
 cottages are rendered and painted     
 white while others retain their brick 
 or stone appearance. The row of       
 cottages by the old Lowesby station   
 originally built for railway employees
 are still occupied as private houses. 
 Most housing in the area is owner     
 occupied as is Lowesby Hall, a fine   
 mansion whose records date back to    
 1313.It is set in nine acres          
 of ornamental gardens laid out by Sir 
 Edwin Lutyens. Lowesby church is even 
 earlier, it and Lowesby village being 
 erected to serve the hall. The ruins  
 of an earlier village may be seen in a
 nearby field, evident by the mounds   
 and bumps which can be seen there.    </content>
