		<title>14Befcote Farm, near Gnosall</title>
		<content>  Farming is the most important        
economic activity in the countryside   
surrounding Gnosall. There are 15 farms
named in the area of our survey.       
  We went to visit one of the largest  
and most modern of the farms in our    
area, Befcote Farm.                    
  835 acres of land are farmed. There  
are 160a of winter wheat, 80a of winter
barley, 47a of spring barley, 40a of   
sugar beet, 13a of fodder beet and 460a
of grass of which 300a are used for    
silage. The winter wheat and barley are
planted before Christmas and the spring
barley in March. There are 2 or 3 cuts 
of grass for silage                    
  There is a dairy herd of 295         
Friesians and altogether 691 cattle.   
The farm produces 6,000 litres of milk 
per day. It takes about 1.5 hours to   
milk about 200 cows. There are ten     
workers on the farm. It is very modern.</content>
