		<title>01GENERAL REVIEW OF BLOCK</title>
		<content> The block is bisected from N to S by  
 the narrow valley of the River Calder.
 Almost in the centre is the pretty    
 village of Calder Vale set in a wooded
 hollow, and dominated by the Lappet   
 Mill which is still producing cloth.  
                                       
 The surrounding area is mainly        
 farmland either for pasture , hay or  
 silage, with small hill farms having  
 cattle for milk or beef, and sheep.   
                                       
 Rounded hills rise gradually from S to
 N and end in bleak fell and moorland  
 on the higher slopes.                 
                                       
 To the NE is the private estate of    
 Bleasdale Tower, surrounded by        
 woodland, while to the SW rises Sullom
 Hill. The land dips gently to the SE  
 and the valley of the River Brock.
