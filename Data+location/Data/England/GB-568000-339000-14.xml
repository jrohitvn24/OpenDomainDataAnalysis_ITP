 a memorial to him exists in the glass 
 of the east window.The clerestorey was
 added at the time of the restoration.A
 canopied tomb of Henry LeStrange and  
 his wife,of 1485,is to be found in the
 church.A monument in the north aisle  
 to Roger LeStrange has on it a        
 portrait of him in brass,acknowledged 
 to be one of the finest in England.   
 The LeStrange family has held the     
 manor for 800 years and,until fire    
 destroyed the Hall,were still in      
 occupation.The earliest part of the   
 Hall was built before 1500.Inigo Jones
 designed the archway of the forecourt 
 in 1618.The gate,courtyard and some   
 outbuildings(now converted to flats)  
 are all that survived the fire.The    
 public has right of way through the   
 parkland on Thursdays.                </content>
