		<content> Country day is the main annual fund   
 raising event of Fakenham Lions Club. 
 This year's profits go to help The    
 Talking Times newspaper for the blind,
 Fakenham Day Centre and to buy        
 equipment for Fakenham Surgery's      
 Physiotherapy Dept. The event, in the 
 centre of the racecourse, consists of 
 Trade Stands, sideshows, craft stalls 
 and Grand Ring displays. Country Day  
 1985 was opened by local TV           
 personality and farmer, Dick Joice.   
 The visiting celebrity was actor John 
 Inman. Grand Ring events were a clown,
 an Alsation dog display team, an axe  
 racing club, a band, an escapologist  
 and a gun dog training display. Events
 that day also included the Fakenham   
 Ten Mini Marathon, a goat show, a     
 flower show, a small animal show, a   
 golf competition, a clay pigeon shoot 
 and a display of static engines.      </content>
