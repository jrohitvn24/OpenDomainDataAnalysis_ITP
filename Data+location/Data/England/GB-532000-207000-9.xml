		<content> My name is Gareth. I am 11 and I live 
 on a Company farm called Highfield. I 
 wake early every day and always have a
 cooked breakfast,usually bacon,egg and
 toast,sometimes with cereals. Then I  
 go out to see what is happening on the
 farm &amp; talk to the farm staff. During 
 the holidays &amp; week_ends I help at a  
 nearby farm,washing cars or gardening.
 The farmer gives me a lift home,and   
 after a bath I have my lunch at 1 p.m.
 Mum always gives us a good meal,meat, 
 vegetables and pudding. As no-one of  
 my age lives nearby I have friends to 
 stay sometimes. Often Mum takes me and
 my sister swimming where we have great
 fun. Tea is at 5 p.m.,usually         
 something on toast,and then we watch  
 television,play games or I ride my    
 bike. I normally go to bed after the  
 9 o'clock news,very tired!
