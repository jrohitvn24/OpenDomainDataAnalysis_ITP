		<title>14RUISLIP/EASTCOTE ENVIRONMENT</title>
		<content>  The majority of people we interviewed
 had lived in the area for more than 10
 years indicating that they are content
 and when asked most people thought the
 area to be a pleasant environment and 
 would not wish to move away. To       
 measure the quality of the environment
 an appraisal method was used assessing
 features such as graffitti, vandalism 
 and litter on a scale of 1 (poor) to  
 10 (good). The areas scored highly    
 with an average of 8, with many people
 liking features such as the duck pond,
 Old Ruislip and Saint Martin's Church.
  There appears  to be some concern    
 from local residents over the lack of 
 sports facilities. At present there is
 a squash club but this is due for     
 closure shortly. Local societies      
 include a Bridge club and a British   
 Legion branch.                        
                                       </content>
