		<title>15DURHAM PIKELETS</title>
		<content> DURHAM PIKELETS are very good for     
 tea.They are  served hot and but-     
 tered piled up on a plate.Sift 200g   
 flour with 50g caster sugar and a     
 good pinch of salt into a basin.Get   
 some buttermilk or milk and little    
 by little stir in about 125ml of it   
 just enough to make a thick batter.   
 Melt 1teaspoon bicarbonate of soda in 
 2 tablespoons of boiling water.Stir   
 this in too.Now grease a frying-pan   
 and get it hot.Take a table spoon and 
 drop the batter on to the hot pan in  
 rounds from the spoon but keep them a 
 bit apart as they spread. Fry your    
 pikelets until they are brown below   
 and bubbly on top, then turn them with
 a fish slice and fry the other        
 side.Put plenty of butter on them and 
 eat them before they are cold.
