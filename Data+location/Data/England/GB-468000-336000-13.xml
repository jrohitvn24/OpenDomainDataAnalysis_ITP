		<title>13GROUPS AT CROPWELL BUTLER</title>
		<content> The{Toddler Group}and the{Playgroup}  
 have a very important role in the life
 of the three villages. Young parents  
 and children are given the opportunity
 to meet, have a cup of tea, and       
 relieve for a little time the stresses
 of the difficult task of bringing up  
 young children.The Toddler Group meets
 on Friday mornings only &amp; all parents 
 must accompany their toddler. The     
 Playgroup meets on Tuesday, Thursday &amp;
 Friday from 9:30 to 12-00. This Group 
 has a small grant from the Social     
 Services Department for toys, and     
 employs a paid qualified Supervisor.  
 Between 10 to 24 under-fives attend   
 and voluntary helpers and even a      
 Grandmother are always on hand.       
 Sometimes one of the Rendezvous       
 members plays his mouth-organ and his 
 melodian for the children's delight.
