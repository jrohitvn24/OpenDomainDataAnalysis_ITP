		<title>15PEEL HALL, INCE</title>
		<content>{ Peel Hall}is a manor house built by  
 the Earl of Makerfield in{1345}and is 
 situated near Rose Bridge. The house  
 is being renovated by the family of   
 one of our{pupils}who says, "I like   
 living in Peel Hall because of its age
 and style. It has more space and      
 bigger rooms, which makes living there
 different. It's peaceful and quiet;   
 there's a large garden for pets and   
 farm animals." His{mother}commented,  
 "Sometimes in this house you feel as  
 if time has stood still; but with gas 
 heating, a washer and a freezer, life 
 is much easier than it was in the     
 past. However, it is draughty in      
 winter." His{father}described the half
 complete renovation, "We bought the   
 house in 1982. To make it water tight 
 the English oak timber frame needed   
 treatment; all the mediaeval wattle   
 and daub had to be removed."          </content>
