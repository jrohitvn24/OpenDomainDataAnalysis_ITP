		<title>16Homes in the Calverton Area</title>
		<content>Calverton is sparseley populated.Well  
maintained, renovated cottages are     
historically interesting and line one  
street.Most are stone built.Some have  
thatched roofs and exposed beams.Three 
alms houses remain.                    
Older "one-up,one-down" cottages are   
situated by the factory in             
Deanshanger.Their walls are brick,stone
or whitewash with sash window.Behind   
those lie semi-detached council houses 
characterised by half brick and half   
pebble-dash walls. Windows have small  
panes of glass. Some have been         
purchased and extended.Many bungalows  
surround the town.The newest           
development of light brick             
semi-detached have large windows and   
glass doors.Stony Sratford's homes     
range from Victorian terraced with red 
bricks to light brick detached houses  
with integral garages.                 </content>
