		<content>The Wrea Green branches of Dr. Barnados
N.S.P.C.C. and R.N.L.I. are all formed 
to raise money for their National      
Institution.   As a result of their    
efforts over a thousand pounds a year  
is sent to various charities.          
     The "Friends of Wrea Green School"
was formed to raise money for the      
village school which is spent on       
educational equipment but also to      
organise social events for the         
families.                              
     There are no village organisations
for boys of primary school age but for 
girls there the Guides, the Brownies   
and the Girls Friendly Society.   For  
children of pre-school age there is the
Tuesday break and also a Play group.   
     The men of the village find their 
recreational meeting place is the pub  
overlooking the Green - The Grapes!
