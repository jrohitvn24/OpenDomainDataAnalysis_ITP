		<content> At Landport, Malling Cooksbridge and  
 Earwig Corner are{allotment gardens.  
{People rent}them from the district    
 council for leisure and to grow their 
 own fruit and vegetables. A 10 pole   
 plot costs{Â£16 a year}but there is a  
 waiting list for allotments in Lewes. 
 New allotment holders often find their
 land very weedy so they have a lot of 
 weeding to do at first.               
 Most people improve their soil by     
 crop rotation and making their        
 vegetable waste into{compost. Manure  
{can also be bought}from a local farmer
 and the many riding stables nearby.   
 Harveys brewery provides used{hops}to 
 put on the soil.                      
 Many of the sheds were once World War 
 2 air raid shelters. A lot of the     
 allotment holders are older men but   
 more and more younger men and women   
 are renting them now.                 </content>
