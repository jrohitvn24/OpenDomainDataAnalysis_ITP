		<title>20A Day With Stephanie cont.</title>
		<content>The morning ends at 11.55am and we eat 
our lunch in the canteen. We play in   
the playground until 1.25pm when after-
noon school begins. In the afternoon we
do painting or modelling, projects or  
games. We finish school at 3.20pm. I   
wait for mummy to finish taking the    
children across the road and then we   
walk home. I change out of school uni- 
form and do any homework I have. Then  
I read or watch television until       
6.30pm when daddy comes home from work 
and we have our dinner. Afterwards we  
either play a board game like Cluedo or
watch television until it is time to go
to bed at 8.00pm. I always have a wash 
or a bath and clean my teeth before I  
go to bed.
