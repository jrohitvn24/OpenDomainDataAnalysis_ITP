		<title>07STONEHENGE POP FESTIVAL</title>
		<content> In June each year thousands of pop    
 fans converge on the site owned by the
 National Trust near Stonehenge to     
 "celebrate" the Summer Solstice with  
 an illegal festival of pop music. This
 has caused anxiety among local        
 residents for a variety of reasons:   
 1 There are no facilities, this causes
  (a) Serious health risks - no toilets
      or proper running water.         
  (b) Mountains of foul smelling       
      rubbish, abandoned cars etc.     
  (c) Damage to trees in the Fargo     
      Plantation, crops and fences.    
 2 Attracts drug pushers and such like.
 3 Shoplifting and theft are increased.
 4 Congestion on roads by hitch-hikers.
 There are, of course, those who feel  
 that the festival should be allowed to
 continue and that facilities should be
 provided, but generally most residents
 are against it taking place.          </content>
