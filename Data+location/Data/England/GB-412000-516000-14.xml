		<title>14LIFE IN WINSTON TODAY.</title>
		<content> The essential conservatism of rural   
 dwellers is reflected in the village  
 of Winston today.   Significantly, the
 th8ngs that attract Winston to its    
 inhabitants are the surrounding       
 countryside, the tranquillity of the  
 village and the friendly atmosphere   
 generated by a caring and hard-working
 community.  this spirit is no better  
 exemplified than by the village hall, 
 constructed in 1956 by the men of the 
 village working without pay.  The cost
 of the materials was raused by holding
 concerts.  Concerts, discos, badminton
 and the Womens' Institute all benefit 
 from the building.                    
 This attitude of community improvement
 is now shown in the Winston Playing   
 Fields Association, which has provided
 a large play area for the village     
 children with climbing frames and     
 tennis courts.                        </content>
