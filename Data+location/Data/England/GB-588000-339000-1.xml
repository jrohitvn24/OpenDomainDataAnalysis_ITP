		<title>01Holkham Park and New Holkham</title>
		<content> This block is a mixture of parkland   
 woodland and agricultureal. What was  
 previously all grassland, has been    
 ploughed and cultivated. It is part of
 the Holkham estate, founded by Coke of
 Norfolk. The estate in its heyday was 
 a model for agriculturalists to       
 emulate. Totally self supporting, it  
 fell into decline but now under       
 Viscount coke is steadily regaining   
 its lost glory.                       
 Totally agricultural in all aspects   
 farming is the only industry. Small   
 model village. Triumphal arches and   
 obelisk the whole Landscape is manmade
 No shops, no pubs, nothing, but a     
 group of houses, but they have a post 
 box.
