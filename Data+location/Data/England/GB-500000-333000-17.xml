		<title>17RELIGION - BRACEBY</title>
		<content> Braceby has 1 church - St. Margaret   
 (CofE) in the Ropsley group parish.   
 Rector Rev. B. Foster, Churchwardens  
 E.Pellew- Harvey, Mrs B. Limb. After  
 years of neglect following a big drop 
 in population, this 13th C. building  
 was very dilapidated &amp; in 1972 was    
 about to be made redundant. Then a    
 doubling of population occurred and   
 the village revived. By the enthusiasm
 and hard work of everyone the church  
 was restored. Braceby shares a parson 
 with 4 other parishes &amp; has 2 services
 a month, (Holy Communion &amp; Family     
 Service alternating) with special ser-
 vices for church festivals including  
 Blessing the Lambs on Shepherds Sunday
 - average attendance over the year is 
 10 from a population of 31. Two bells 
 dated l275 &amp; l590 rehung this year(see
 photo). Members of other faiths have  
 to travel to nearby towns to worship. </content>
