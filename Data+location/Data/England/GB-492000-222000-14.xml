		<content>  Grove priory is an archeological site
 near Leighton Buzzard. It was         
 discovered in 1930 and todays         
 archeologists started work in 1972,   
 but on 20th August 1985 it is due to  
 be turned into a sand quarry.         
  The earliest archeological remains   
 found at Grove Priory were from a     
 small Saxon Settlement. Small pits    
 were first discovered and then holes  
 called  Post Holes. There have also   
 been monastic finds dated around 1254.
  Everything on the site is kept clean 
 and tidy. Trowels are used to remove  
 the soil in layers and trowelling is  
 done systematically so that all the   
 ground is covered. Patches of coloured
 soil can tell the archeologists what  
 had been there in previous years.     
  The finds of the digs are stored in  
 plastic seed trays before being sent  
 to Bedfrod Museum to be catalogued.   </content>
