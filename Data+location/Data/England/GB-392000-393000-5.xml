		<content>   At the end of the last century the  
 area was highly industrialised.There  
 were large cotton mills in Hyde,which 
 had developed becouse the climatic    
 conditions were suitable and sources  
 of power were readily available. In   
 Denton,hatting was prolific,as it had 
 been for hundreds of years. These     
 industries provided many opportunities
 for employment which brought with them
 an influx of population.              
   In the course of this survey we have
 found that most mills are still in use
 as industrial units but in a rather   
 different way.They have been let      
 off in individual units to countless  
 small companies. Premises are used for
 a variety of manufacturing purposes   
 such as light engineering and "the rag
 trade" but also for recently popular  
 activities such as fitness,karate and 
 judo clubs and dance studios.         </content>
