		<title>11Barn Owls</title>
		<content> It all started when Mr Marney came    
 jogging past our school and stopped   
 for breath.Teresa Deasy shouted him on
 and the next thing we knew he came    
 into school with his animals and told 
 us stories about various animals he   
 had looked after in the past.         
         About the owls                
 He had got 2 Barn owl that had been   
 hurt in the wild,John kept the owls.1 
 was a male and 1 was a female,They    
 were soon well.They mated and         
 incubated the eggs.They hatched and   
 sadly the owls were'nt capable of     
 looking after them,themselves.The     
 chicks died and the next year they    
 laid more eggs,4 of them hatched and  
 Annie,Johns helper fed the owlets on  
 cut up chicks and fed them with care  
 and patience.This time they lived to  
 be strong and healthy.(Cont.at 12,13)
