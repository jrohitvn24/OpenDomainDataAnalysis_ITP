		<title>05Building Tradition,Stebbing</title>
		<content> Stebbing has a wealth of timber framed
 houses.There is no local stone and the
 basic building materials available    
 were oak, elm and flint,used almost   
 exclusively over the centuries.Timber 
 frame construction flourishes in      
 Stebbing to the present day.If you    
 remove all the walls and roof of a    
 timber framed house the load bearing  
 frame remains.Unseasoned timber was   
 used and as the oak warped,unusual    
 house shapes formed.Infill material   
 was wattle and daub,changing to lath  
 and plaster.Damp proof courses were   
 not used until the 20th century.The   
 horizontal sole plate stopped rising  
 damp.There are local builders skilled 
 in repairing these old houses as well 
 as constructing new houses using brick
 and modern materials.
