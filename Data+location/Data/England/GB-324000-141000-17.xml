		<title>17Fishing the Parrett Estuary.</title>
		<content>{Mr.Sellick},who lives at Stolford, is 
 the only man that fishes on the mud   
 flats on the River Parrett Estuary.He 
 has been fishing since he was 14! His 
 father and grandfather also did it    
 before him. He goes out every day,2   
 hours before low tide. He catches     
 shrimp,crabs,eels,squid,mullet,plaice,
 doversole,bass,salmon and other common
 fish.If there are Westerly Gales the  
 seaweed is brought up and gets caught 
 in the nets and he does not get so    
 many fish.He pushes a wooden sledge,  
 which he has made,out onto the mud. He
 collects the nets he has set on the   
 previous low tides and puts out empty 
 ones for the next catch.He has a small
 building near his house in which he   
 has a big freezer to keep his catch.He
 cooks the shrimps in a container over 
 a wood fire.He sells them to locals,if
 his catch is big it's sold at Bristol.</content>
