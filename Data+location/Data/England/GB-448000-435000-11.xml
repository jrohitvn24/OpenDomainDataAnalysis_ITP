		<content>    The area is mainly {arable farming,
 the average farm size is 138.2        
 acres.The farmers don't employ many   
 people,the average being only one.    
    The most common piece of machinery 
 is the tractor.Most farms don't hire  
 anything but between three other farms
 they hire 2 sugar beet lifters,1      
 combine harvester,1 grain drier and a 
 wagon.                                
    On the farm the busiest time of    
 year is harvest time,when the crops   
 have to be collected and sold to      
 companies.The main crops are wheat,   
 barley,potatoes but some rape and     
 grass.Wheat provides the most income. 
                                       
          Barkston Ash drainage is good
  because the soil is made of{limestone
  but in Church Fenton the soil is hard
 and made of{clay}so it isn't well     
 drained land.                         </content>
