 Deighton village remains small,       
 consisting of the church,village hall 
 and a row of cottages built of local  
 brick,several of which are single     
 storey, and surrounded by farms.  The 
 main change is that most of the       
 cottages are now privately owned and  
 not attached to the "Manor",which is  
 about 120 years old and has now been  
 divided into two residences. All the  
 cottages have been modernised and are 
 owned by people who work outside the  
 village. In 1935 the cottages were    
 sold for around Â£60, today prices are 
 around Â£45,000. Four new houses have  
 been built by farmers for their       
 retirement. A Riding School is run    
 from one of the cottages.             </content>
