		<content> The age of the houses built by the    
 council is 30-40 years. Most houses   
 are semi-detached with some terraced, 
 maisonettes and bungalows . Most are  
 built of brick with tiled roofs and   
 casement windows.The average number of
 people living in a house is 5. Most   
 have at least one TV, and many have   
 videos, computers and Hi-Fi. Most     
 children go to Pilgrims Hatch and     
 Hedley walter school.All homes have a 
 garden. Most people shop in Brentwood 
 at large supermarkets. There are small
 old peoples' housing estates. Peoples'
 opinion of Pilgrims Hatch transport   
 service is that it is satisfactory.   
 It's a quiet place,close to the town  
 and close to the countryside but could
 do with more leisure facilities.
