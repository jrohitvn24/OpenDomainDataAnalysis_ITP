		<title>09THE BUILDINGS OF ALDERTON</title>
		<content>   Our square included most of the     
 village of Alderton and we undertook a
 survey of the buildings.              
   We counted 125 buildings of which   
 120 were private dwellings. The other 
 5 were a shop, barn, school, village  
 hall and a church. These other        
 buildings constituted the amenities of
 the village apart from a public house 
 which was outside our square.         
   We sorted the private dwellings into
 4 categories, detached &amp; semi-detached
 houses, terraced houses and bungalows.
 We found that there were almost equal 
 numbers of each category except for   
 terraced houses of which there were   
 only 20. These were older, terraced   
 cottages in the village centre.       
   Over half the houses surveyed were  
 new, having been built in the last 20 
 years. Of the remainder only 21 were  
 considered to be over 100 years old.  </content>
