		<content> The bulk of this block is gently      
 undulating moorland covered mostly    
 by heather species. Thre are no roads 
 so the area is litte visited except by
 walkers. There is one house and a few 
 grain fields in norht east and about  
 1.5km of coniferous forest plantation 
 in the north west. The rest is        
 moorland and a small amount of        
 deciduous woodland in NE. The only    
 uses apart from forestry is the few   
 sheep that graze the moors and rough  
 grass in valley. Also bee keeping in  
 the summer and grouse shooting in the 
 winter.                               
 It is in the National Park but because
 it is remote it attracts few tourists,
 apart form walkers or backpackers, who
 seem to prefer the less barren        
 landscape or areas closer to the      
 roads.
