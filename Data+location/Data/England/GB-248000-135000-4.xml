		<title>04Boode Farm.</title>
		<content>{Boode farm}was roughly built around   
{1840},but historians cannot say for   
 certain.{Mr Fowler}who runs the       
 farm,took up farming through his      
 father who passed the farm onto him.In
 the days when his father owned it,the 
 farm was quite small.More recently    
 though,it has expanded.The total area 
 of the farm today is{540}acres.The    
 land is used to produce a variety of  
 products.Mr Fowler keeps a variety of 
 animals on his farm.These include;-   
{sheep,cattle,horses and dogs.}He also}
 grows a variety of{crops:             
{wheat,maize,barley and fodder.        
 He doesn't know about the future.He   
 might pass the farm onto one of his   
 children if they are interested or he 
 might sell the farm.We think this     
 would be a shame as it has been in the
 family for a long time.
