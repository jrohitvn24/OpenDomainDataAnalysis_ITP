		<title>03THE RIVER HULL</title>
		<content> The River Hull cuts through the centre
 of the area flowing north to south. A 
 number of small industries cluster    
 along the banks of the river but the  
 main impression is of decay. Though   
 there are many small businesses there 
 are large areas of abandoned          
 properties and dereliction. The River 
 Hull is still important for trade,    
 barges still ply the tidal waterway,  
 some as far as Beverley ten miles     
 away, but the bulk of the industry has
 gone. The effect of this on the       
 community is devastating. The         
 industrial collapse combined with the 
 disintegration of Hull's Fishing      
 Industry has led to an unemployment   
 level in excess of 50% in certain     
 sections of this area.
