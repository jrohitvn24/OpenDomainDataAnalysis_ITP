		<content>  LEAKY:-Leaky is like hide and seek   
 except,when the person who is on spots
 one of the people who are hiding he   
 runs back to a post and says,"Leaky   
 David ,1,2,3,4,5."When everyone is    
 caught,the person who was caught first
 is on and the game starts over again. 
                                       
 HOP-SCOTCH:-Hopscotch is another game 
 that is marked on the playground.It is
 a fairly small game but many children 
 can play as you take turns throwing a 
 stone onto numbers.The numbers are    
 written in squares and are from one to
 ten.You reach your chosen square by   
 jumping and hopping to it.When you get
 to 10 you come back down until you    
 reach 1 again.You are then allowed to 
 pick one of the numbers for a bed and 
 the other players have to avoid       
 treading on it.
