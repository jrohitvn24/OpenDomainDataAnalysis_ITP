 study and fellowship. Confirmation    
 classes are also organised in the     
 home.

 Witnesses, Christian Scientists, Roman
 Catholics, Methodists, Athiests,      
 Agnostics, Faith Healing, Born Again  
 Christians and Superstitions Combined 
 with Christianity and Church Ritual.

 cleaning, flower arranging, teaching  
 the children who attend Sunday School
