		<title>01The Great Bromley District</title>
		<content>{Great Bromley}is a small village in   
 North East Essex, about 9 kilometres  
 from the town of Colchester.          
   The surrounding area is mainly      
{farmland}and woodland. There are many 
 arable farms and a poultry farm.      
   The village is very quiet. The      
 houses and other buildings are        
 scattered. The new A120 road ,to the  
 port of Harwich ,was built 5km. away, 
 but the narrow roads in the village   
 have very{little traffic.}            
   The public transport is very poor.  
 Only{3 buses per day}pass through the 
 two main villages of Little Bentley   
 and Great Bromley.These are operated  
 by the Eastern National Bus Company.  
   In the centre of Great Bromley is   
 St.Georges Church, which most         
 villagers attend on Sundays.          
 We conducted a{survey}of 31 villagers 
 via children at the local school.     </content>
