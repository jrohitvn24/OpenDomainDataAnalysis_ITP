		<content> The local spring is near Hammerpot    
 Inn, but springs are a common feature 
 of this region.                       
 A spring is a name given to any       
 natural outflow of water from rocks.  
 They are commonly found where         
 permeable rocks lie above an          
 impermeable layer.  In this area chalk
 downs lie to the North, and a clay    
 lowland to the Southern coastal plain.
 The well jointed chalk is saturated to
 the level of the water-table and      
 water, guided by joints, flows out at 
 the junction with the impermeable clay
 rocks and runs down the hillside as a 
 tiny stream.  Springs commonly occur  
 at the foot of the steep chalk slopes.
  Villages have grown up around these  
 powerful springs and the line of      
 villages sited at regular intervals   
 along the scarfoot is known as        
 spring-line settlement.               </content>
