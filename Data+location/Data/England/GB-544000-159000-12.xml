		<title>12 CUDHAM - CHURCH</title>
		<content>                                       
 {The Church of St. Peter and St.Paul} 
is the oldest building in the parish of
Cudham. It is a pretty, knapped flint  
building standing on the edge of the   
recreation ground in the centre of the 
village.  Mentioned in the original    
Domesday Book  it has been altered and 
extended over the years and changes    
are still being made.  The tall spire  
can be seen for some distance through  
the surrounding trees.  An old tunnel  
once led to a monastry out on the      
hillside, but this has now been filled 
in.  A large and interesting graveyard 
surrounds the church, some of the      
tombstones dating back many hundreds of
years. Sheep are used to keep the grass
short during the summer.               
 Two ancient yew trees stand on the    
south side of the church. (See Page 15)
