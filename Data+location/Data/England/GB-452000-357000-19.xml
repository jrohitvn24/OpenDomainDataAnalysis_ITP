		<content> Berry Hill Hall is on the southern    
 outskirts of Mansfield.Some of the    
 owners who lived there from 1790 were 
 Mr.William Bilbie,Sir Edward Walker,  
 George Lees and Mrs.William Hollins.  
          In the eighteenth century    
 the owners would have owned all the   
 land in the area and would have been  
 lords of the manor.On the 3rd May 1924
 the hall was officially opened as the 
 Mansfield and District Miners Welfare 
 Convalescent Home.                    
 In 1953 the Health Service took over  
 and it is still used for many other   
 sorts of accident victims.
