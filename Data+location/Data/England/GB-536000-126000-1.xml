		<content>{HISTORY IN HORSTED KEYNES             
    Horsted Keynes is an old village in
 West Sussex, tucked away in the woods 
 between Haywards Heath, East Grinstead
 and Crawley. It dates back to before  
 the Norman Conquest, when the Saxons  
 called it Hors stede (horse place). A 
 Norman named de Cahainges was given   
 the land and so it became Horstede de 
 Cahainges. A lot of old houses are    
 still to be found which make the      
 village more attractive and give it a 
 pleasant character.                   
{Hope Cottage                          
    Probably built in about the  17th  
 century as a bakery. Later it was a   
 sweet and toy shop, then an antique   
 shop, and now a house. During the 2nd 
 world war the garage was used as the  
 local fire station. This pretty little
 cottage has only four rooms.
