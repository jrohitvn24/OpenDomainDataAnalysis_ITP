		<title>08STRATFORD CATTLE MARKET</title>
		<content> On Tuesdays in Stratford is a Cattle  
 Market,{pigs, sheep}&amp;{cattle}are sold.
 They arrive by lorry,each kind of     
 animal is put in an area of pens in   
 groups.To be sorted sheep are dabbed  
 with paint,pigs are sprayed and cattle
 have labels with numbers on.When the  
 auctioneers are ready to auction they 
 ring a bell.Sheep and pigs are sold   
 from pens and the{auctioneers}walk    
 along planks above calling out a price
 for each animal.Farmers bid for       
 animals,but instead of calling they   
 use a special signal.Small pigs are   
 Â£40,big pigs are Â£120 and sheep Â£30.  
 Cattle are sold by weight,and cost    
 Â£600.It opens at 9am.They stop{selling
 cattle at 12pm, sheep and pigs at 1pm.
 Sheep have big holes punched in 1 ear 
 after they are sold because farmers   
 can claim a subsidy, this stops the   
 possibility of them claiming it twice.</content>
