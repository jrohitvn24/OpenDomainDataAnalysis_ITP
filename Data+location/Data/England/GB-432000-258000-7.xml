		<title>07THE CHURCH-WARDEN-CHESTERTON</title>
		<content> There are two church wardens who work 
 for Chesterton church only.One has    
 been church warden for about 25 years.
 The other has recently taken on the   
 job.They are unpaid and their duties  
 include mowing the grass in the       
 churchyard,dealing with maintinance in
 the church and when a new vicar is to 
 be chosen the church warden helps to  
 decide on the most suitable person.The
 longer serving church warden finds it 
 quite hard work.He made a candle      
 holder for the Easter candle from a   
 local elm tree in the shape of the    
 ancient font.He also helps the vicar  
 look after the people.
