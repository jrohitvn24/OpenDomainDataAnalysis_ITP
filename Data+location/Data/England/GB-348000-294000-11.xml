		<title>11MUSIC IN CARDINGTON,SHROPS.</title>
		<content>                                       
    The music of a small village like  
 Cardington is necessarily a microcosm 
 of that of society as a whole,although
 we are perhaps blessed with an above- 
 average sprinkling of musicians. There
 is the sacred music of the church     
 choir,the duo that play for pints in  
 the Royal Oak,the duo that play for   
 the local gigs and the pianist who    
 teaches music at home and neighbouring
 school.                               
    The children too play a variety of 
 instruments with strains of piano,    
 violin,clarinet,bassoon,recorder,flute
 and latterly a selection of brass band
 instruments supplementing the         
 background of constant murmurings in  
 this quiet community.
