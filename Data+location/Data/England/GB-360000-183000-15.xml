		<title>15A SHOP OWNER'S VIEWS.</title>
		<content>  A small shop owner in Almondsbury    
 was interviewed. She said that{farms  
 are{disappearing}very quickly and new 
 houses are being built instead.       
  The{farmhouse}which used to be next  
 to the shop has now been{knocked down 
{and is}now {AZTEC WEST}offices.The    
 same thing will be happening to       
 Woodlands Lane.                       
  An average of about 600 people live  
 in the village. In the evening the    
 younger people in the village go to   
 the{social club}which is just down the
 road from the shop. The older people  
 go to the sports centre for outside   
 activities and bowling.               
                                       
  The{motorway}hasn't made any         
 difference to the store because the   
 owner has learnt to live with the     
{noise}and the motorway is quite along 
 way from the shop.                    </content>
