		<title>06WILDLIFE IN TERLING</title>
		<content> Terling is surrounded by farmland with
 a good selection of trees, but Dutch  
 Elm Disease has destroyed most of the 
 elms. The area abounds with wildlife  
 including hares, rabbits, pheasants,  
 partridges, moorhens and numerous     
 smaller birds and animals. There is an
 occasional siting of woodpeckers, tree
 creepers, heron and a good number of  
 finches. Deer are very rare here now, 
 but one was seen in 1984. Foxes, jays,
 magpies, and crows are rarely seen    
 since they are kept to a minimum by   
 the gamekeepers who rear pheasants all
 round here.There are not so many frogs
 now.The River Ter contains among      
 others trout, eels, stickleback and   
 minnows. Also water voles can often be
 seen.Terling Village and the          
 surrounding area is fortunate in still
 retaining it's many small woods and   
 hedges virtually unchanged.           </content>
