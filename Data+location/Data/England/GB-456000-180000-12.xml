		<title>12CHALK DOWNLAND FLORA</title>
		<content>      The rock under the Downs is      
{chalk.}This makes a special type of   
 soil,called an alkaline soil,on which 
 some wild flowers grow particularly   
 well. When you walk on the Downs you  
 see a{magnificent landscape.}Much of  
 the land is used for growing crops;the
 flowers grow on parts which are not   
 cultivated.                           
     {Rest Harrow}can grow up to 30cm. 
 high with tough stems. The leaves are 
 small, serated and oval. The flowers  
 are usually pink and their petals look
 like cups' handles.                   
     {Common Rock Rose}is a pale yellow
 flower which appears between June and 
 September. The caterpillar of the     
{Brown Argus Butterfly}feeds on its    
 leaves.
