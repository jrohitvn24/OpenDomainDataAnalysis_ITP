		<title>19Parish Church of W Kingsdown</title>
		<content> The{Church of Edmund, Saint and Martyr
 is picturesquely set in a clearing in 
 woodland, with a{well-tended burial   
{ground.} The churchyard is entered by 
 a very heavy and not particularly     
 ancient{lych-gate}of{Victorian}origin.
                                       
 The church itself is{small,}reflecting
 the size and wealth of its            
 congregation until recent times.      
{Norman}in origin, there are still     
 signs of the early church visible in  
 the fabric of the building today.     
 Unusually the{tower}is on the{south   
 side of the church.  In one of the    
 window arches can be seen traces of   
 very old{wall paintings.              
                                       
 The church is kept locked when not in 
 use, but has a{viewing panel}in the   
{west door}to permit the visitor to see
 some of the beauty of the interior.   </content>
