   School ends at 3.15 pm but on       
 Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday there 
 are voluntary after school activities 
 until 4.15 pm. After that on Tuesday I
 go to the local library, which is just
 up the road from my house. Also on    
 Tuesday evening I go to bell-ringing, 
 which is great fun! On Thursday at    
 5.30 pm I have a piano lesson. (My    
 teacher is the son of a famous        
 orchestral conductor who died a few   
 years ago.)                           
   On Saturday I go shopping with my   
 mother. We go to Bishop's Stortford,  
 which is our local market town. At    
 about 5.00 pm we have our tea, which  
 is, of course, again bran, "which is  
 good for you"!
