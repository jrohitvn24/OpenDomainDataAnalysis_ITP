		<content> The church building was begun in about
 1150; it was rebuilt and had a tower  
 added in the 1250's and remains almost
 unchanged today.                      
{The pastoral care, or 'cure' is the   
{responsibility of the Bishop of St.   
{Albans,}who shares this care with the 
 Rector.  The Rector also has the care 
 of the church building; this he shares
 with{two churchwardens and the        
{Parochial Church Council.} The Rector 
 leads worship, baptises people,       
 marries them and buries the dead.     
 There are{joint services}with the     
{Methodist Church,}and the{Roman       
{Catholics}use the church for their    
 worship.  A liaison committee of      
 clergy and laity from each church     
 meets to plan joint services and      
 events.  Members of the churches meet 
 for Bible study and discussion.
