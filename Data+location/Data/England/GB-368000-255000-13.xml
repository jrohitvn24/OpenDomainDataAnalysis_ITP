		<title>13Lower Brockhampton</title>
		<content> Lower Brockhampton is a black and     
 white moated manor house.Today it is  
 a farmhouse one room serves as a      
 minimum.There is  a lot of armour and 
 a big oak table with long benches and 
 there are even the old fire buckets.  
 To date the old manor house has been  
 standing for over 350 years and is    
 very old fashioned. The house         
 continued to be lived in either by a  
 farming tenant or employee and        
 fortunately was never modennised.     
 Lower Brockhampton is today in the    
 care of the National Trust and still  
 the home of a farming family.         
 A delightful drive winding steeply    
 down though woodland and stream from  
 the lodge at the A44 is a pleasure    
 enjoyed by many visitors before       
 reaching the seclusion of the postion 
 of Lower Brockhampton in a beautiful  
 valley.                               </content>
