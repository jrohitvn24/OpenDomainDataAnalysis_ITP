		<title>07FARMING.</title>
		<content> A high percentage of farm owners have 
 changed from keeping live stock to    
 arable farming.They changed to arable 
 farming because it is more profitable.
 Most of the farmers grow Corn, Sugar  
 Beet, and Potatoes, e.t.c.            
 Among their machinery they have       
 Combined Harvesters, Tractors, and    
 Sugar Beet Harvesters. They also have 
 machines to spray their crops with    
 chemicals, to protect the crops from  
 insects and parasites.                
 The farmers own the farms they        
 work.The farms have been in their     
 families for years. The farmers employ
 out side help to work for them in the 
 busy seasons but they depend on their 
 own families to do most of the farm   
 work.Every farmer owns around the same
 amount of land- approximately Two     
 Hundred and Thirty acres.
