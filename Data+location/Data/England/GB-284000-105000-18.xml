 Most people who are able to drive have
 access to a{car.}Drivers give lifts to
 others. A{bus}makes two journeys on   
 Fridays to Crediton for shopping      
 linking with buses and trains to      
 Exeter. Adults can use the school     
 bus in term time. Some{suppliers} and 
 services visit to the village         
 regularly, which compensates for the  
 absence of public transport. These    
 include a butcher, a fishmonger, a    
 county library, a hairdresser, fish &amp; 
 chips, a milkman, Sunday newspapers.  
 In 1965 there was a weekly bus to     
 Tiverton, two buses a week to Exeter, 
 via Crediton weekly. In 1905 there    
 were 2 horse-drawn{carriers}to Exeter 
 each Friday. People then walked,      
 cycled or went by pony and trap.
