		<title>03FARMING:DARTMOUTH ESTATES.</title>
		<content> The land is mainly good grassland     
 pasture and is currently worth between
 Â£1000-Â£1200 an acre with vacant       
 possession.Land values have fallen    
 recently.Lord Dartmouth does not sell 
 his land but re-allocates it to his   
 larger tenants when tenancies are not 
 renewed due to a farmer retiring or   
 selling his farmhouse to a third      
 party.Six farms are being built up in 
 this way for only the larger efficient
 farmers can make a worthwhile living. 
 The largest farm is around 230 acres. 
     It costs about Â£85 an acre        
 annually to keep the land in good     
 condition.Sprays,fertilizers and      
 careful cultivation are needed or the 
 land will quickly revert back to rough
 grazing.The upper moorland ridges have
 hungry,acidic soil and they are not   
 likely to be used for stock-bearing   
 in the foreseeable future.            </content>
