 There are many different buildings in 
 Carlisle. Some are just ordinary      
 houses, and others are of historical  
 interest. Carlisle is a city because  
 we have a cathedral which is very old.
 It is about 700 years old, and is     
 built of sandstone.                   
       We also have a castle which now 
 has a museum. There is also another   
 museum called {Tullie House}.         
       There are also different types  
 of houses such as Victorian and       
 Edwardian. In Carlisle there are a lot
 of old factories. {Carr's}biscuit     
 factory is an example. It is now owned
 by United Biscuits.
