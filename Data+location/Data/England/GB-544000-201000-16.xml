		<title>16SCHOOL IN EPPING ON MONDAY</title>
		<content> When the whistle is blown we go       
 upstairs and sit at our desks.Our     
 teacher has words written on the      
 blackboard and we have to make        
 sentences using these words.When I    
 have finished the sentences I read a  
 book.Later I do Maths until breaktime,
 when I eat crisps or a chocolate      
 biscuit.After break I settle down to  
 English.I next work at my organisation
 project.I finish it at 12.00, when I  
 have my lunch.After lunch,at 1.10 p.m,
 Mrs Miller reads to us until 1.30 when
 we have P.E. After P.E.(Physical      
 Education) I do work cards until      
 French at 2.45 p.m. After French I go 
 home in my mummy's car with my        
 sisters.I get home,have a drink,read, 
 watch television and then my daddy    
 comes home from work.I have tea amd go
 to bed ready for the next full,happy  
 day.                                  </content>
