 People came from as far as Australia. 
 British people from London,Coventry,  
 Bath.                                 
 3 out of 4 people wanted dogs banned  
 from beaches because of the mess and  
 because they don't like them.         
 Most people walked to the beach.      
 People come to  Treyarnon because it's
 safe for children,the rocks and sea   
 are pleasant,the surf is good and the 
 sand is fine.                         
 Most people come to the beach daily   
 while they are on holiday and have an 
 ice cream once a day.Most people      
 thought that the ice cream cost too   
 much,they think it should be          
 ten - twenty five pence instead of    
 thirty to forty pence.                
 Some people use the beach shop but    
 many don't.                           </content>
