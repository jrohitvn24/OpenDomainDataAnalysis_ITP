		<content> Most people have in the village for   
 about 7 years, and they came because  
 it was near their work or because they
 liked the village and the area.       
 Everybody liked living there, and none
 of them wanted any changes made,      
 except for one man who said the       
 village hall was in the wrong place   
 and wanted it moved. The village has  
 grown over the last few years, but    
 nobody minded.   One woman did say it 
 had grown enough, and if it got any   
 bigger it would turn into a town.     
 Most people go to work by car, some by
 bike, and one even walks.   They all  
 go into Hereford at least once a      
 month, most of them once a week.   The
 usual means of transport is by car.   
 Watching television is the most       
 popular entertainment, though some go 
 into town.   Most people would like   
 more to do in the village.            </content>
