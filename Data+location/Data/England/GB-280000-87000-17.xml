		<title>17OTHER SOCIETIES IN DUNSFORD</title>
		<content> In the past small communities had to  
 create their own entertainment.With   
 increased personal transport this is  
 no longer true but thankfully the     
 community spirit still survives here. 
 With a small population many people   
 will be members of several societies. 
 This helps to promote cooperation.What
 is most noticable is the way in which 
 a person will be a leading organiser  
 at one event and a minor helper or a  
 passive onlooker at another without   
 jealousy or criticism.                
 In addition to the D.A.D.S.there are  
 many societies in this area including-
 Women's Institute,  British legion,   
 P.T.A.,Junior Sports Club,Cricket Club
 Charity Action and Fund Raising Groups
 Church based Societies and Royal Oak  
 based teams.
