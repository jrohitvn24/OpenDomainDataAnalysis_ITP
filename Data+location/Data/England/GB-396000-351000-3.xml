		<content>   Cheddleton has grown from from a    
 very small hamlet to a village with a 
 population of 6,500.                  
   Brittains Paper Mills provided      
 employment for men and women. A row of
 houses were built for them in 19xx.   
   Joshua Wardle Ltd. at Leekbrook     
 needed more workers as they expanded. 
   St. Edwards Psychiatric Hospital    
 provided employment for ancillary     
 staff (nurses male and female had to  
 come from a distance of 50 miles      
 before they were employed by the      
 hospital).   St. Edwards Hospital will
 close about the year 2000.            
   Joshua Wardle Ltd. are still dyeing 
 and manufacturing textiles.           
   There do not appear to have been any
 disputes between management and       
 employees when Brittains had to lay   
 off a number of their workers. This   
 has been achieved amicably.           </content>
