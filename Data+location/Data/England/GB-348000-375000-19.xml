		<content> Miss Blythe is ex_chairman of the     
 Frodsham Parish Council.She handed    
 over the chain of office after her one
 year to Mr.Astbury.Miss Blythe told us
 that the council meets twice a month  
 to discuss issues relating to the area
 such as footpaths,litter and play     
 areas.Miss Blythe enjoyed her year in 
 office but found it hardwork and is   
 now having a well earned rest.She is  
 still very busy working in the village
 She is a keen gardener and produces   
 all her own vegetables.Miss Blythe is 
 a non_driver and so keeps fit by      
 walking.This is easy as she lives at  
 the top of Frodsham Hill.Miss Blythe  
 has lived all her life in Frodsham and
 was educated at the old infants school
 and Frodsham Girls School before going
 to convent school in Chester.She      
 enjoys watching sport on television   
 particularly snooker and rugby.       </content>
