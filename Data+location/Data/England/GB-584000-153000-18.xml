		<content>     Each year there is a village fete 
 held on the village green and         
 sometimes a carnival procession       
 through the streets in which the      
 school takes part.                    
     There is an annual "Superstars"   
 competition in which families from the
 village compete against each other in 
 feats of sporting skill.              
    The village school and football    
 club hold annual "Boot Fairs" to raise
 funds and these have become popular   
 social events.                        
     The school holds an annual Sport's
 Day and every few years hosts a       
 combined carol service in the parish  
 church for all the village schools in 
 the area. This year an egg rolling    
 competition was held on the downs at  
 Easter.                               
    An entertainment evening is held at
 the school, devised by the children.  </content>
