		<title>12PETS IN AYLESFORD AND ECCLES</title>
		<content> The result of a small sample survey of
 Eccles, taken by the children of St   
 Peters, showed that 30% of the        
 household's kept a cat.The children of
 St Peter's School were surveyed       
 regarding dog ownership,revealing that
 a similar proportion of families kept 
 a dog.                                
       Twice as many people chose to   
 keep pedigree rather than mongrel     
 dogs.Less than 10% had bred from their
 dogs.To our surprise not one family   
 attended dog training classes.Less    
 than 10% feed their dogs on fresh     
 meat.About twelve estavlishments in   
 the block either keep horses or       
 provide livery facilities for others  
 to do so.                             
          Horse riding is an important 
 recreational pursuit in the area.
