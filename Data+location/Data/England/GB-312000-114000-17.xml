		<content> Simon came to N.Devon with a Danish   
 raiding party,mutinied,was put ashore.
 He found his way to the cave of Old   
 Mol,Overlord of Exmoor,who was ill.   
 Simon cared for him until he died,    
 married his daughter and became Over- 
 lord himself.He bathed at Simonsbath, 
 Exmoor.About 700 AD King Ine of Wessex
 who farmed near Taunton led the Saxons
 to clear Celtic Dumnonii tribes of    
 Devon and Exmoor from Blackdowns.     
 Simon fought many battles,but was     
 defeated and killed at Symonsborough, 
 buried at Simon's Burrow.Friends made 
 a huge barrow surrounded by four      
 smaller cairns. The large Barrow was  
 thought to contain treasure guarded by
 devils, who would punish those who    
 dared to move the stones,but in 1870, 
 James Bale,a road contractor despoiled
 the barrows by removing all the stones
 without apparent harm to himself.     </content>
