		<title>07THE GRAND UNION CANAL</title>
		<content> The stretch of waterway from the      
 Flakes north of Coppermill Lock to    
 Black Jack's Lock falls within the    
 sphere of Hillingdon Borough's Canal  
 Locks Conservation Area Advisory      
 Panel.During 1985 plans for           
 redeveloping the old industrial area  
 to the south of Coppermill have been  
 mooted.The Panel wanted industry to be
 maintained and opposed a new housing  
 scheme here,well outside the village  
 and adjoining chalk downland of       
 special scientific interest.Even so, a
 change to residential use remains a   
 possibility. A factory site beside the
 canal in South Harefield has already  
 been turned into a housing estate - so
 the precedent has been set.           
  The canal remains an important       
 recreational site and any development 
 should also take cognisance of this   
 fact.                                 </content>
