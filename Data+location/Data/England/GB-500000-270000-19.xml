Children in the 1980's play many games 
to keep themselves amused.             
SCHOOL PLAYGOUND GAMES -These games    
usually fit in with the time of year.  
In Winter we skip - In Autumn we play  
"Conkers" - In Summer we like to play  
"Rounders" and in Spring we play       
"French Skipping". We also play many   
other games. "Football" and "Tig" are  
played all through the year.           
STREET GAMES -The main games here are  
"Tig" and "Football". Children also    
play on their bicycles and roller      
skates. Some of the games, for example 
"Hide And Seek","Bulldog" and          
"Redrover" can be rather noisy.        
PARK GAMES -Football and Cricket are   
the main games but Rounders, Athletics 
and "Tig" are also played.
