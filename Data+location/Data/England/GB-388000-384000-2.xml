		<title>02HAZEL GROVE STATION.</title>
		<content> There were originally two stations at 
 Hazel Grove, one operated by the      
 Midland Railway which was closed in   
 the early 1930's.  The track is still 
 in use for freight only, but from next
 year it will carry diverted passenger 
 traffic from Manchester to the South  
 of England via Sheffield. Engineering 
 work is currently in progress to      
 connect a new link line.   The        
 existing station is on the suburban   
 line and carries heavy commuter       
 traffic.  The station was rebuilt in  
 1977.  The Buxton/Manchester service  
 is operated by diesel multiple units. 
 Since early 1980 electric multiple    
 units have operated through services  
 to Altrincham station. The road bridge
 is narrow and hazardous. It is        
 scheduled to be widened next year.Bus 
 and rail services combine at the      
 station.There is also a free car park.</content>
