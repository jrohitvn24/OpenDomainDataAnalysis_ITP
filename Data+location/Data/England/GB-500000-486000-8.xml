		<content> In the eastern part of our area there 
 are many signs that we live in a      
 tourist area.Many of the terrace      
 houses are used as guest houses and   
 bed and breakfast homes.One of the    
 main signs of tourism is the number of
 parked cars.People try to avoid paying
 for car parks.People can be seen      
 walking in the streets in holiday     
 clothes.Shops have started selling    
 buckets and spades,rubber rings and   
 other beach equipment hang outside the
 small general stores.In our school we 
 have 300 families.25% have parents    
 working directly in the tourist trade.
 And 23% open their homes to           
 holidaymakers.
