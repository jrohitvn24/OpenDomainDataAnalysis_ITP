		<title>09 The first Council Estate</title>
		<content> North Hull Estate is fifty years old, 
 and it shows. Sameness is even more   
 evident than on Orchard Park. If there
 are twelve house patterns on Orchard  
 Park Estate, there are only six on the
 North Hull Estate. But fashions change
 and a huge advantage for North Hull   
 was the vogue for building very low   
 density housing during dthe 1930s. The
 great spin-off was huge front and back
 gardens. People were not pressed close
 together in their living space. Could 
 this just be the reason for limited   
 spoiling graffiti? Perhaps it is more 
 simply the lack of spatial opportunity
 as there are no "wall hordings" to    
 to match the High School gymnasia;    
 there are no secluded underpasses; and
 there is no single large shopping     
 centre to match the Orchard Park      
 Centre.  On the other hand the degree 
 of social deprivation is the same.    </content>
