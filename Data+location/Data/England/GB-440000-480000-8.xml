		<title>08The Shopping Centre cont.</title>
		<content> ll were on holiday, l9 had come to do 
 their shopping, 3 worked in Thirsk,   
 and l was visiting friends.           
 Most people who live in Thirsk had    
 walked or cycled to the centre. The   
 others had all used cars, except one  
 who had come by train.                
 People who live in Thirsk go to places
 such as York, Middlesbrough,          
 Northallerton and Ripon to buy most of
 their larger articles e.g. furniture. 
 We think there are quite a lot of     
 shops here, considering that Thirsk   
 is not very large. It is probably     
 because a lot of people come in from  
 the villages around, and also because 
 there are a lot of tourists. A        
 good trade is done from them.         
 There are about 5O market stalls on   
 Mondays and 3O on Saturdays. Type of  
 stalls: fruit, clothes, shoes, plants,
 toffee, tools, vans sell fish.        </content>
