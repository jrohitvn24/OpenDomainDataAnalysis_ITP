<title>21HIstory of Barlaston Methodist Church</title>
<content>

Barlaston Methodist Church was built in 1932 in Park Drive (then known as Park Avenue). Methodist worship began in a cottage in Tittensor following visits from Charles Wesley to the area in the 1780s. From 1880 services were held in two converted cottages in Tittensor road. By 1932 the £1500 needed to build the new church had been raised (£1 was requested for 33 bricks). It was the first United Methodist Church to be built in Staffordshire. In 1962 a Youth Hall was built behind the chapel at a cost of £1240 but by the late 90s it was badly in need of repair. The land attached to the church, which had been given by a local farmer Mr. Evans, was sold and with the proceeds the new hall was completed in 2001. This was followed by the refurbishment of the chapel which was rededicated in 2006. Church activities include a Women’s Guild, Boys Brigade and Youth Club for youngsters up to 13 years.   &lt;br />
