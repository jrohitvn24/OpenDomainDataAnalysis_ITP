 A Butchers Day:                       
 Mr Minshall is a Butcher and Green    
 grocer. He opens both shops at 7.30am.
 On Tuesday he collects meat and fish  
 from the market. His job involves the 
 preparing and purchasing of meat and  
 slaughtering of animals. He grows his 
 own vegetables to sell. Mr. Minshall's
 job involves more hands than machines.
 He and his employees wear special     
 clothing, an overall and apron. The   
 busiest days of the week are Thursdays
 and Saturdays. The busiest times      
 of the year are Christmas and Easter  
 when people buy special food.{
