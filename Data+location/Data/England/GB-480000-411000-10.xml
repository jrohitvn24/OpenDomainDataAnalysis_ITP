		<content> -Along Chapel Lane,Keadby.            
 There is rail access to the stores.The
 3 chimneys are 97m high and weigh 4420
 tonnes.The internal diameter being 5.7
 m.The station was gradually run down  
 and officially closed in October 1984,
 because the Drax station had 11 times 
 larger output capacity,and many of the
 machinery parts were obsolete.When    
 the plant was closed the workforce    
 were given 3 options-early retirement,
 voluntary severance pay or alternative
 employment within the industry.At the 
 moment contractors are taking out the 
 machinery most of which is being sold 
 for scrap.The precious metals e.g.    
 copper and brass are being removed and
 sold.Then the asbestos will be removed
 under controlled conditions so none   
 gets into the atmosphere.The brickwork
 demolition will not be for another    
 two years.                            </content>
