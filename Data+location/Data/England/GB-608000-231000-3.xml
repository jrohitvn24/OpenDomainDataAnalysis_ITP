		<content> In the High Street the houses are     
 fairly old. My house (no.48) is over  
 300 years old, you can tell by the    
 structure of the beams in the loft.   
 It has two fireplaces upstairs, which 
 we think are Edwardian. The two houses
 beside us (no.46,44) are about the    
 same age as ours. All of these three  
 houses used to be one doctor's surgery
 and there is a door in one of our     
 cupboards connecting to next door.    
 After that it was a grocer's shop and 
 you can see the lump where the sign   
 was. There are also large windows like
 shop windows.
