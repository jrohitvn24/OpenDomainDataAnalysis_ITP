		<content>{Sheep.} When  we went to visit the    
 farms we found that thirteen farmers  
 kept sheep in the area that we        
 surveyed and four farmers had no sheep
 at all . The different kinds of sheep 
 we found are Devon Longwool, Poll     
 Dorset, Dorset Horn, Dorset Cross and 
 Suffolk. Most farms had a mixture of  
 these breeds.The total number of sheep
 kept in the area amounted to 3,416.   
{Lambing.}                             
 The time of lambing varies from farm  
 to farm. Some farms have lambs in     
 December and March and some have      
 lambing all the year round. The total 
 amount of wool collected during the   
 year was 6,704 kg,s. Adding all the   
 farmer's lambs together the total     
 number of lambs born in 1984/1985     
 was 4,724.
