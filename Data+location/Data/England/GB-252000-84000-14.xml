		<title>14Bogflowers of Dartmoor.</title>
		<content>    When walking Dartmoor in the summer
 keep you eyes open for the white tufts
 of{cotton grass.}This is generally a  
 sign of wet boggy ground coming up. In
 a dry summer there are no problems,   
 but when it is wet, beware of the     
 cotton grass.                         
    The signs of the bog are to be     
 looked for if you are interested in   
 flowers. The nitrogen starved wet soil
 has caused some plants to become      
 insectiverous. The commonest of these 
 plants on the moor is the{Sundew.}Its 
 sticky leaves close on the unwary     
 insect crawling over it, and gives the
 plant much needed nitrogen.           
   Finally there are the{orchids.}These
 are generally small, but give a splash
 of colour to the bog, yellow against  
 the brillient green of the moss. Rare 
 now, but still around, if you look for
 them.                                 </content>
