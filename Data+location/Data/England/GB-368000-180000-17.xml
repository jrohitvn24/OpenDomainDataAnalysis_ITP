		<title>17LOW FLYING AIRCRAFT</title>
		<content> In this area we get quite a lot of low
 flying aircraft on training flights.  
 Sometimes they are as low as thirty   
 metres.The ones that are very low make
 a terrific noise. The ones that are   
 not too low still make a loud noise.  
 One of the aeroplanes nearly knocked  
 our roof off once. Fighting squadrons 
 sometimes fly overhead in groups.     
 Sometimes they are cargo planes and   
 some are fighters. Some people object 
 to planes flying low but some like it.
 The fighters fly very fast and they   
 also make the most noise. The cargo   
 planes are just the opposite. They fly
 slowly and do not make too much noise.
 The cargo planes are very big too. The
 planes practise here a lot because it 
 is more out in the country. If they   
 practised in the town or city that    
 would disturb more people.
