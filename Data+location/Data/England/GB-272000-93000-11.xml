		<content> A Victorian school and master's house,
 as well as a chapel and a farmhouse,  
 are in red brick, providing an        
 unusually great contrast from the cob 
 and thatch. The School is now the     
 Village Hall, and the master's house  
 a private dwelling. At the same time  
 several houses were built in pale     
 orange brick, produced locally at     
 Tilery, now Thornemoor. There are 2   
 wooden dwellings and 2 residential    
 caravans. All the modern buildings are
 bungalows, because of planning        
 regulations, requiring them to blend  
 into the landscape.
