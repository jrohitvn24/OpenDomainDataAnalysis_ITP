		<title>18TOURISM ST NEOT'S WELL</title>
		<content> The well is  about a quarter of       
 a mile west of the church,in Milltown 
 fields,and may be reached by a lane   
 close to the corner of the St Neot    
 garage.Very many years ago the garage 
 was an inn.About the same time there  
 was an ancient arch of stone over the 
 well with doors to the entrance.About 
 the year 1762 a large and spreading   
 oak grew on the bank above.It was of a
 fan like shape and had probably been  
 allowed to grow untouched for         
 centuries.It was however cut down by a
 tenant for building purposes.The well 
 was restored by Captain Charles       
 Gerveys                               
 Grylls,in 1852.People believed that   
 the well had strange powers and people
 came from as far away as Exeter to    
 bathe their children in the waters of 
 the well on the first three mornings  
 in May.                               </content>
