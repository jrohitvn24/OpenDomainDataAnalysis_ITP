		<title>14RADSTOCK COUNCILLOR</title>
		<content> We interviewed Mr Chalk who is a      
 councillor for Norton Radstock town   
 council.He has worked on the council  
 for a year.The full council meets     
 every six weeks but other commitees   
 meet twice a month.                   
   Mr Chalk enjoys being a councillor  
 because he likes helping people with  
 their problems and seeing things done.
 Duties include meeting people and     
 contacting other councils.This work   
 takes up two evenings a week of his   
 time but he does have other interests.
 He likes sport and also makes wine.   
  He did not need any educational      
 qualifications but only a residential 
 qualification.The council have no     
 financial problems because there is no
 overspending.Unfortunately there is no
 computer available to the council but 
 they hope to have one soon.           
                                       </content>
