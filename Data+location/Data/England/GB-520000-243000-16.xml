		<content>   Newton Farm is owned by Mr Bath. It 
 was previously owned by Mr Albert     
 Course and his family. The farm was   
 built on land originally owned by 3   
 families.                             
   As a vacant possession Newton Farm  
 is worth about Â£400,000. The farmhouse
 was built in 1826.                    
   The farm has 200 acres of arable    
 land which produces corn for seed     
 which is sold under contract to Banks 
 of Sandy. The farm produces 800 tons  
 of corn seed a year which is worth    
 about Â£80,000.                        
   Nitrogen fertilizer is used on the  
 fields. Mr Bath owns 5 tractors, 1    
 combine harvester and 1 fertilizer    
 spreader.
