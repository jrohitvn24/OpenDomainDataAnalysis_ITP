		<title>12Preparation for Show:Pateley</title>
		<content>   On the evening before the show, my  
 Uncle selects pairs of pork pigs for  
 evenness of size and weight. At 7.30am
 on show day, they are fed and watered.
 He arrives at the show by about 9.00am
 and the pigs are then put into pens.  
 There he washes the pigs with hot     
 water and detergent. Then he rinses   
 them and dries them with a towel.     
 Finally, he dusts them with white     
 sawdust so they look clean.           
  Our cattle are washed thoroughly the 
 day before the show. The next day, if 
 needed, they are given a quick wash   
 and then taken to Pateley. Once at the
 show ground, the animals are brushed  
 in order to make them look wider and  
 fatter. When our class is called, we  
 lead our animal into the ring for     
 judging. All the cattle are lined up  
 side by side.The judges then look at  
 each animal and decide on a winner.   </content>
