		<title>01THE SOUTH DOWNS &amp; ALFRISTON</title>
		<content> Except for one kilometre square which 
 is Alfriston, the rest of the area is 
 chalk downland, used for arable       
 farming, though there are some sheep  
 and cattle.  There are many trackways 
 across the downs which have been in   
 use since the Bronze Age and earlier  
 which are now used by walkers, riders 
 and joggers.  There is a great deal of
 wildlife on the downs and in the      
 spring and summer there are           
 wildflowers of great variety and      
 beauty growing particularly on the    
 scarps.  It is a bare landscape and   
 what trees there are have been blown  
 lopsided by the prevailing S.W. winds 
 coming up the English Channel.
