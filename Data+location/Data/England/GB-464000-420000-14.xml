		<title>14HOSPITALITY IN SNAITH</title>
		<content> There are four public houses in       
 Snaith; the Plough, Black Lion, The   
 Downe Arms and The Bell and Crown. At 
 one time there were as many as        
 sixteen. Two of those that have       
 disappeared are the Clock Face ( now a
 house) and the Cross Keys. The owners 
 of these vanished 'pubs' were         
 Elizabeth Gilderdale and Mary Riley.  
 Behind the Plough there are three     
 stables which used to be used for     
 clients horses when too far gone to   
 ride home.
