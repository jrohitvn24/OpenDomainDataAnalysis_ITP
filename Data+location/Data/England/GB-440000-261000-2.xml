		<title>02Housing in Southam</title>
		<content> Southam is a market town, occupying a 
 convenient position and is accessible 
 to a number of other Midland towns.   
 This contributes much to its success  
 in attracting new residents. There are
 three council estates although many   
 tenants are now buying their homes.   
  There are numerous private estates.  
 The latest to be completed lies to the
 north of the town and consists of 50  
 new houses. Adjacent to the playing   
 fields of St. Mary's R.C. School, a   
 new private development is nearing    
 completion.                           
  There are many types of homes to     
 choose from. There are flats by the   
 river Stowe, delightful bungalows with
 views over open fields, thatched      
 cottages and modern executive homes,  
 all occupying prime positions in this 
 delightful market town.
