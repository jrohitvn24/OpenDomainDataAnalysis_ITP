		<content> crop potatoes which sometimes cause   
 the fields to be unready for the      
 Autumn sowing of wheat.               
  Fertilisers are used on a large      
 scale,for although the peat is fertile
 ,elements of copper and manganese are 
 often lacking and aplications of these
 minerals are sprayed over the area.   
 Crop rotation is also practised to    
 help reatain soil fertility.In the    
 fertile peat not only crops grow but  
 also weeds,so as the organic content  
 of the soil makes herbicides difficult
 to develop special chemicals are used 
 and insecticides have also been       
 developed.Fenland farms tend to be    
 smaller than those on the surrounding 
 upland,being on average only 50 acres.
 Good profits can be made from a       
 relatively small area.There is a      
 variety of crops grown which include  
 cereals,rootcrops and vegetables.     </content>
