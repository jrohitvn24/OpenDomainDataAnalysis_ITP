		<title>20Christmas in Wolverhampton</title>
		<content>Christmas is a time of rejoicing,of    
asking relatives around. On Christmas  
Day in 1984 my Nan was with us. I had a
lot of lovely presents,a record player,
skirt and lots more. Christmas at home 
is lovely and I feel sorry for people  
like tramps who haven't any home and   
countries like Ethiopia where there is 
a famine and families are dying. The   
record "Feed the World" has helped them
a lot but they need more. I am glad I  
am not there. We had a Christmas Tree  
with lights and glittering baubles.    
There was a really big Christmas Tree  
with lights on outside St.Peters Church
and the nativity scene is there as     
well. I hope this custom lasts because 
this helps people to realise that it is
Christmas and,if only for a short      
time,they are kind to each other.
