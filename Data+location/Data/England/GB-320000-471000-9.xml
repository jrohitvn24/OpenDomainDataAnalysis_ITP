		<title>09A typical day of Mr.Wilson</title>
		<content> My Dad is an insurance agent.His      
 office is at Barrow but his customers 
 live in the Coniston to Ulverston     
 area.He gets up in the morning and has
 a cup of tea .Then he gets dressed .He
 goes down stairs to get the post if   
 there is any.Before  he goes to work  
 he spends about an hour on paper work.
 People sometimes phone him in the     
 morning to see if he can come round to
 give them advice about insurance.He   
 starts his round of his costomers at  
 about 10.30am.His work involves going 
 to people's houses to give out life   
 insurance and other insurances.He     
 comes home at dinner time and then    
 goes back to work.When he gets home at
 tea time he has his tea and watches   
 T.V.  Sometimes he goes to the pub to 
 play snooker at about 9.00 pm and gets
 back at 10.30pm and watches a film and
 then goes to bed.                     </content>
