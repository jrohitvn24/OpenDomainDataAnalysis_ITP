 about 30 people working for him.9 of  
 them work full time-40 hrs.per        
 week.They start at 7.00 a.m.&amp; stop    
 when all their work is finished.They  
 sell cup &amp; open mushrooms &amp; a special 
 quality for caterers.Prices start at  
 65p.per pound for,"rejects," &amp; rise to
 80p.for cups.Spawns are sprinkled on  
 pasteurised horse manure &amp; in a few   
 days a layer of chalk &amp; peat is added.
 Mushrooms grow through this layer.    
 There are 12 sheds &amp; it takes 12 days 
 for the whole process.They are picked 
 over 3 days. Each shed has 78 "beds", 
 6ft. by 4ft., which are stacked about 
 8 feet high, &amp; there are 20 tons of   
 compost per shed. Compost can only be 
 used once so it is then sold. The farm
 was established in 1948. Mr. and Mrs. 
 Sum have owned it for 4 years.(Written
