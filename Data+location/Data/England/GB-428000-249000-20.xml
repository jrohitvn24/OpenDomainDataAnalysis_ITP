		<content> The "D Block is overwhelmingly        
 rural,with in reality only two        
 important roads traversing the        
 area,namely the B4451 passing through 
 Butlers Marston,and the ancient Roman 
 road "The Fosse way".The Fosseway runs
 from the bottom left hand corner of   
 the "D Block"- north passing to the   
 west of Combrook with a spur to the   
 village.The road then runs to its     
 first main population centre Leicester
 in the north and Stow to the south.The
 main characteristic of the road is its
 straightness,allowing the traffic to  
 move speedily.At peak traffic times   
 the road is very busy indeed and quite
 comparable to a very busy road in any 
 urban area,for it must be remembered  
 that this is a largely commuting area.
 That this ancient road should be so   
 prominent in this backwater of England
 is somehow appropriate.               </content>
