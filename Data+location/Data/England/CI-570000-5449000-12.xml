		<title>12GEOFFREY'S LEAP</title>
		<content>    Just north of Gorey is a headland  
 known as 'Geoffrey's Leap', sometimes 
 spelt 'Jeffrey', about which there is 
 an interesting legend.                
                                       
    At some time in the 14th or 15th   
 century Geoffrey was convicted of a   
 serious crime against a woman, and his
 punishment was to be thrown off of    
 this high rock between Gorey and Anne 
 Port. A masked executioner threw him  
 into the sea, some sixty feet below,  
 but despite the huge drop Geoffrey was
 seen swimming back to the shore. Some 
 of the crowd wanted him thrown over   
 again; others said that he should go  
 free. Geoffrey settled the argument by
 throwing himself over the cliff again,
 in a fit of bravado. He struck his    
 head on a rock on the way down, and   
 died.
