		<content>{RELIGION:}A group of about 30 twelve  
 year old children were asked about the
 influence of religion in their life.  
 almost all were nominally Church of   
 England,1 Methodist &amp;4 not christened.
 Despite this only 2 went to church    
 regularly, the remainder only going on
 special occasions.The maximum distance
 anyone lived from a church was 3 miles
 &amp; only 1 person said church was       
 significant in his/her life.          
{SUPERSTITIONS:}Don't open an umbrella 
 indoors;Pick a 4 leaf clover for      
 luck;Don't put new shoes on a         
 table;Touch wood for luck;Don't cut   
 toe nails on Sunday or finger nails on
 Friday;Don't pass somebody on         
 stairs;Don't walk under a ladder;Don't
 sing carols before Christmas;If spill 
 salt throw some over left shoulder;   
 Break a mirror- 7 years bad luck;     
 Wearing green is bad luck.            </content>
