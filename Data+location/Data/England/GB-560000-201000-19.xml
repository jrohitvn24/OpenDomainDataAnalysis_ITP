		<title>19The River Wid</title>
		<content> The source of the{Wid}lies somewhere  
 to the north of Blackmore,probably in 
 a triangle formed by Redrose Lane,    
 Spriggs Lane and Fingrith Hall Lane.  
 Here the{landscape}consists of several
 ponds and springs.Much of the water   
 has  been channelled into{ditches}and 
 runs along the Chelmsford Road, from  
 Elkins Green to the{Pond}.The Wid then
 forms two ponds divided by a road     
 bridge .At the end of this pond a dam 
  regulates the flow southwards.Until  
 recently the Green was subject to     
 flooding and an outflow of{sewage }   
 after heavy rain. For a time the      
 stream forms part of the defensive    
 ditch of the old{Priory}and then flows
 under Wenlocks Lane to the south a    
 eventually becomes a{tributary}of the 
 Can{.Ecology}along the Wid includes   
 fish,kingfishers,huge dragonflies ,   
 small mammals and plant life.         </content>
