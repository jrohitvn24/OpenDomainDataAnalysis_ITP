		<title>07A Day in my life.(R.Taylor)</title>
		<content>When I first woke up,I washed and put  
on my School uniform before breakfast  
of Weetabix and toast.My mother took my
brother and me in the car to St Thomas'
school. Before school we played Tig    
until 9a.m. After Assembly and Prayers 
we had Maths , English and Religious   
Knowledge. For lunch I had sausage,peas
and potatoes followed by a jam         
doughnut. I went on the field with my  
friends where we played Bulldog and    
Sticky Toffee.After Prayers in the     
afternoon I worked on my topic about   
flies, followed by some History. I     
played line tig in the afternoon break 
and then I read my book. When I went   
home at 3.30p.m.I had a clarinet lesson
before my favourite tea of kebab and   
chips. I played outside with my friends
for a while before my mother called me 
to go to bed at about 7.30p.m.
