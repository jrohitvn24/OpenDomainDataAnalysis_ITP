		<title>08Planes over Holbeach Marsh</title>
		<content> The R.A.F Holbeach Weaponry Range has 
 been used since 1928 for training     
 British and Western Alliance Military 
 Pilots .The weapons they use are      
 strafe, firing, bombing and           
 rocketry.The bombs and rockets have a 
 small flash and smoke charge so that  
 they can  be plotted.There are eight  
 targets at R.A.F Holbeach ,including  
 three ships,for bombing.The targets   
 are widely spaced in the safety       
 zones.They have to rebuild the targets
 at weekends and evenings.R.A.F        
 Holbeach is a small unit on the       
 marsh.The aircraft can fly very low   
 over our school because there are no  
 towns or hospitals in the area .They  
 must fly above 500ft.The aircraft that
 they use are A10s,Harriers and F1 11s 
 which belong to the U.S.A.F.The       
 aircraft that go over cause a lot of  
 bother night and day.                 </content>
