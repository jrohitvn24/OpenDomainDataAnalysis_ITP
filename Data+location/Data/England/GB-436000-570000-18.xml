More nightlife and entertainment       
needed.Gardens could be improved while 
the sea front houses could be tidied   
up.There could be better seafront      
seating and toilet facilities.There    
should be more parking areas,more      
Metros and a better bus service.There  
should be more events organised during 
the day as there is little on offer-   
local events should be better          
publicised and there should be more    
local authority organised events such  
as beach parties.The promenade and sea 
front walking areas could be improved. 
There should be more hotels and some   
indoor sports centres.The beach should 
be cleaned up.*

of our survey).
