		<content> Seamer lies about 4 miles from        
 Scarborough and buses run frequently  
 between the two.The buses stop 4 times
 in Seamer village.The journey itself  
 takes about 12 minutes and costs 48p  
 for an adult and half that for a      
 child.Fares go up often so the number 
 of Seamer people using the Seamer     
 services has dropped in the last 10   
 years.Approximately 500 passengers use
 Seamer station per week.The trains    
 used to be diesle units but now are   
 main line coaches hauled by           
 locomotives.In the summer 84 trains   
 pass through Seamer per week and in   
 winter 60 per week.Their main         
 destinations are York,Liverpool,Hull, 
 Holyhead and Manchester and returning,
 to Scarborough.The speed of the trains
 between Scarborough and Seamer is     
 60mph and between Seamer and York     
 70mph.                                </content>
