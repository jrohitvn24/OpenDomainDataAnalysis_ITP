		<title>01OWLS IN BLUE-BELL WOOD</title>
		<content>{Bluebell wood}is in the{Piethorn      
{valley}in the{Pennines. Bluebell wood 
 is a nature reserve and you are not   
 allowed to take any plants or animals 
 without permission from the{Piethorne 
{Warden.}In{Bluebell wood}we found some
{owl pellets}which show that{owls}live 
 in the wood or near by. If you look   
 inside a{pellet}you will find{        
{bones,grass}and{leaves.}The owl has no
 teeth and usually eats its prey whole 
 all that is left comes in a pellet out
 of the owls mouth after its eal. But  
 we did not see any owls because we    
 went during the day but there is other
 evidence that{squirrels,mice}and{voles
 live there. We saw a squirrel and a   
 mouse and found vole bones in the owl 
 pellet.
