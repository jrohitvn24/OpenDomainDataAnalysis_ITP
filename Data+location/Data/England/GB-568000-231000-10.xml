		<title>10Playing out 1985</title>
		<content>     We did a survey of what people    
 call playing out and which things they
 did most often.The most popular was   
 bike riding which was chosen by 12    
 people .Then next most popular was    
 making dens chosen by 7 people.Netball
 was next with 6 people then swimming  
 with five people and play fights with 
 four people.                          
      Lots of people in Finchingfield  
 play  in the pond.Sometimes they have 
 stone fights and mud fights,they ride 
 bikes quite a lot.I like it best when 
 we play with boomerangs and frisbys.  
 It is also quite good when we play    
 cricket and football.We play rounders 
 and dabber(a local Braintree area name
 for "He")also we play army in the     
 churchyard. Sometimes we make dens and
 have water fights.
