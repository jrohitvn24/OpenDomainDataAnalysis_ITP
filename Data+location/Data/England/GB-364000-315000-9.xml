		<content> The only existing place of worship in 
 the village is the parish church of St
 Chad,although there is evidence of an 
 earlier chapel on the site.The present
 building was erected around 1300.A    
 tower was added in 1722,and the       
 present windows are Victorian.One     
 distinguishing feature inside the     
 church is the Minstrels gallery.      
  Although historically an independent 
 parish for many centuries the village 
 now shares an incumbent with nearby   
 Preston and Tibberton.There are       
 however regular Sunday services still 
 held,with a Sunday school continuing  
 weekly.The Parochial Church Council   
 with its elected offices of           
 churchwarden,Secretary and Treasurer  
 still flourishes as part of the       
 Diocese of Lichfield.There is a Parish
 Council of five who meet several times
 a year.                               </content>
