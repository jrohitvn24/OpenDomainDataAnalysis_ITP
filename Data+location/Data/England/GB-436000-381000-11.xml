		<title>11Law and Order-Hackenthorpe</title>
		<content> The area is under the control of      
 Hackenthorpe Police Station.Generally 
 this is a quiet area with very few    
 crimes.The most frequent calls on the 
 police are for traffic accidents      
 especially on Birley Moor Road which  
 is a notorious blackspot for          
 pedestrian accidents.Radar guns have  
 been used on here and White Lane to   
 detect speeding motorists.The most    
 frequent crimes are teenage           
 crimes:e.g.Inter-school rivalry       
 leading to fights; thefts-of and from 
 cars and motorbikes; burglary,        
 especially near Christmas.            
 There is only one small police station
 in Gleadless,but it is not always     
 manned.Every police station in the    
 area is connected to the early warning
 system in the event of a nuclear      
 attack.                               
                                       </content>
