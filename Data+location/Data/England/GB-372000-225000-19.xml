		<content> During my life I have seen many       
 changes in the Town. When I was a boy 
 a car was a rare sight and most people
 either walked or had a pony and trap  
 or used the train. The train and      
 ponies have gone and there seems to be
 cars everywhere it's quite a problem  
 finding a safe place to cross the road
 sometimes. I'm glad the big lorries   
 don't come through the Town now, they 
 use the by-pass.                      
 The shops are better and there is a   
 wider choice of goods, but did you    
 know that there used to be two boot   
 and shoe repairers in Newent -we did  
 alot of walking before cars.          
 There are lots of new people in the   
 area, once I used to know everyone    
 that I met in the streets. I suppose  
 people have got to live somewhere     
 and I can think of no better place to 
 live than Newent.                     </content>
