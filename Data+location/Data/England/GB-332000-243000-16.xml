		<title>16Bredwardine; Farming I</title>
		<content> Farming is the most important         
 occupation in the area; one-third to  
 one-half of the total population is   
 engaged in this. Farms vary in size   
 from 500 acres down to 25 acres and   
 there are three which form part of a  
 very large estate (Moccas Estate), the
 western part of which is in our area. 
 Most farms are run by the farmer and  
 his family, although the larger ones  
 employ extra manpower on a regular    
 basis together with some seasonal     
 help. They are all mixed farms, those 
 on high ground being given over       
 largely to grassland and trees,       
 although some cereals and rootcrops   
 are grown. Lower down in the valley   
 wheat, barley, roots, hay for silage  
 and some green vegetables are grown.  
 There is also a fruit farm catering   
 for the 'Pick-Your-Own' trade.
