		<title>05LIFE AT WRITTLE COLLEGE</title>
		<content> Part of the College is on the site of 
 an old palace belonging to King John  
 from the 13th Century but this has    
 since been demolished. To get into the
 Colege the students must have worked  
 on a farm for at least one year. They 
 must also have 'O' Levels for the     
 National Diploma or 'A' Levels for the
 Higher National Diploma. The College  
 day lasts from 8.45a.m.to 5p.m. with a
 one hour break for lunch. During the  
 day they study either agriculture,    
 agricultural engineering, commercial  
 horticulture or amenity horticulture. 
 Some of the results of these studies  
 could lead to assistance with the     
 construction of golf courses and      
 sports fields.
