 necessary school belongings in a tray.
 This measures 35 x 25 x 7cm.You keep  
 books in it such as reading books,text
 books and exercise books.Other objects
 you keep in your tray are,lined       
 backing sheet,pens and coloured       
 pencils,rulers,rubbers,occasionally   
 calculators,compasses,protractors and 
 pencil sharpeners.Coloured pencils are
 usually kept in a bag or a            
 box.Dictionarys can be kept in you    
 tray but usually kept on a shelf in   
 the classroom.Trays are stacked in a  
 wooden trolley overnight.Another form 
 of storage is the desk.The desk holds 
 about 5/6 times more than the         
 tray.It's lid lifts up so you keep all
 your school things in there.You sit at
 your desk for lessons.Some schools    
 dont have trays or desks.Children
