		<content>{   Newcomers}seem to settle quickly   
 in Ellesmere Port and enjoy the       
 amenities.{A boy from Colchester}felt 
 there was less violence here.He also  
 commented "I have made more friends   
 here".{A person from Belfast}wrote    
 "Primary Schools here are about half  
 the size of the ones back home, so I  
 seem to get to know less people.One of
 the things I like is the public       
 library system - more libraries and a 
 better selection of books.{Ellesmere  
{Port has fewer shops}but is smaller   
 than Belfast... people travel in much 
 the same way but there are more       
 bicycles".                            
    People living in{Great Sutton and  
{Little Sutton}think the area is{clean,
 and like the{open spaces.}A survey of 
 pupils showed that most homes in this 
 area have either a{video recorder, a  
{computer,}or both.                    </content>
