		<title>12HISTORY (FROYLE/HOLYBOURNE)</title>
		<content> There was a a church in Froyle at the 
 time of Domesday, owned by the nuns of
 Winchester.                           
 There were apple orchards and later   
 hop fields in the village.  There are 
 Tudor, Georgian and Victorian houses  
 and farms.                            
 Roads have always crossed the area.   
 The Harrow Way was a{prehistoric track
 near the hill fort at Dickets         
 Plantation.  There were two{Roman     
{roads}and later the mediaeval road    
 through Alice Holt by the pass of     
 Alton.                                
 Pilgrims travelled past{Froyle Cross  
 along the{Pilgrims Way.}              
 The main road was a coaching route and
 the railway was built alongside it.   
 The modern bypass made the village a  
 quiet backwater
