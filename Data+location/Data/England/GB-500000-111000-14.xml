		<title>14FARMS IN BURY &amp; HOUGHTON</title>
		<content> There are 2 dairy farms, both in      
 Houghton, one of 500 hectares and the 
 other of just 30 hectares.  The price 
 of their cows varies from a basic     
 Â£1000 up to Â£5000 for a top quality   
 animal. Both farms grow barley for    
 their animals and store large         
 quantities of silage for winter feed. 
 The milk is collected daily and taken 
 to Chichester for distribution. The   
 two farmers help each other especially
 at times of intensive activity e.g.   
 harvesting. Both farm houses are very 
 old being built as 3 cottages in the  
 14th century and the other as large   
 house in the 16th century.            
 There are 3 other types of farms, two 
 are fruit farms, one concentrating on 
 apples whilst the other grows mainly  
 soft fruit;the third is a Trout farm.
