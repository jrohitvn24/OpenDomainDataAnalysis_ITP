{BURTON HOUSE}in{NETTERFIELDS}at {     
{BYBROOK.}There were gallows at what is
 now known as {SPEARPOINT CORNER}, as  
 well as on at{PENLEE POINT}used to    
 warn incoming travellers of the strict
 laws of{KENNINGTON.}What is now called
{FAVERSHAM ROAD}was once a toll road   
 with the main toll house being the    
 small house outside the {TOWERS SCHOOL

{ULLEY ROAD}called {ST.MARY'S}which was
 built in 1270 which is part of the    
 Church of England. During the Second  
 World War, a plane crashed into a     
 garden which is now part of Church
