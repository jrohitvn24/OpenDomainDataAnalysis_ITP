		<title>05Change in Strelley Village</title>
		<content> Mr Clarkson, Chairman of the Strelley 
 Village Preservation Society says:    
   "I think it is a pity that{Strelley 
{Hall}is no longer the main house of   
 the village as it was in Miss Edge's  
 time. But I think it is better to have
 a firm in it like PAFEC than to let it
 fall down. Mr Henshell has done more  
 towards preserving the hall than you  
 would expect. I believe that, where   
 possible, if he has had to put a door 
 way through he has used old blocked up
 door ways and pierced them and has    
 retained the stable stalls for office 
 cubicles. I don't think the{church    
 will ever be knocked down because it's
 too important as a building. Perhaps  
 some historic trust will look after   
 it. But, in the future, as a religious
 building it will probably close down  
 because there are too few people to   
 form a congregation."                 </content>
