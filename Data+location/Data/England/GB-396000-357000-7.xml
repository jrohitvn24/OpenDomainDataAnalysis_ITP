HASN'T BEEN EATEN OR HAS GONE OFF.     
CARDBOARD AND PAPER PACKAGING ARE USED 
TO MAKE PRODUCTS MORE ATTTRACTIVE AND  
TO CATCH YOUR EYE SO YOU WILL BUY THEM.
THIS IS UNECESSARY RUBBISH AND WASTES  
OUR NATURAL RESOURCES. IN YEARS TO COME
PEOPLE MAY  DISCOVER THE RUBBISH TIP   
AND FIND TINS WITH PICTURES OF PEAS ON 
THE LABEL AND WILL REALISE THAT WE ATE 
PEAS I WONDER IF, WHEN FINDING A TIN OF
DOG FOOD (FOOD WHICH WE FEED TO OUR PET
DOGS) THEY WILL THINK THAT WE ATE DOGS.
THERE ARE OTHER KINDS OF RUBBISH       
BESIDES HOUSEHOLD RUBBISH. INDUSTRIAL  
WASTE COMES FROM FACTORIES AND HAS TO  
BE   DISPOSED OF VERY CAREFULLY. OLD   
CARS OLD FRIDGES, DISHWASHERS AND BEDS 
OFTEN END UP ON THE RUBBISH TIP.PERHAPS
IN THE FUTURE ALL RUBBISH WILL BE      
RECYCLED IN ORDER TO SAVE THE WORLDS   
NATURAL RESOURCES BEFORE ITS TOO LATE. </content>
