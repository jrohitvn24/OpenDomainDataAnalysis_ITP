		<title>14 HAMPRESTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The village consists of about 20      
 buildings including a farm,church and 
 school. Originating in Elizabethan    
 times,today's village was rebuilt in  
 the 1930's.The oldest part of the farm
 is 400 years old.                     
    The 13th.century church has a      
 congregation of one villager and      
 various people from the Ferndown and  
 West Moors area.About 20 years ago    
 there was a village shop.             
    The village school with 74 pupils  
 remains open when nationwide small    
 country schools are being closed.     
    Local development plans as outlined
 in the Ferndown and West Parley       
 consultative document provide for the 
 preservation of the original character
 of the village area.
