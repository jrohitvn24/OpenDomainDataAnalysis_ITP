		<title>09QUARRINGTON PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content> In{Domesday Book}the entry was for two
{churches,}but now there is only one.  
 It is dedicated to{St Botolph.}The    
 rectory is not occupied at the moment 
 but it is hoped that the new Rector   
 will move in when he is appointed. The
 Bishop is considering joining         
 together the five parishes of{Silk    
{Willoughby, Quarrington, Leasingham,  
{Cranwell}and{Sleaford}under three     
 Rectors.                              
 During May l985 there were 5{Baptisms 
 and 5{weddings}in{Quarrington}church. 
 There are three{keyholders}in the     
 parish. Each keeps the church keys for
 a fortnight or three weeks by         
 arrangement. The keyholder must wind  
 the{church clock}every fourth day.    
 There are two{church wardens.}The     
{church hall}in Grantham Road is used  
 by a dancing school and for many      
 social pastimes.                      </content>
