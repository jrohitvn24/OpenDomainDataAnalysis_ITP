		<title>16THE MOUSE TRAP</title>
		<content>   The{mouse trap}belongs to{Mr and Mrs
{Cooke of Coppice Farm.}It has been in 
 their family for many years and       
 is still in working condition.        
   The mouse trap consists of five     
 small compartments, each big enough   
 for some cheese or bacon rind and a   
 mouse to fit in.It is made of wood and
 metal.                                
   The trap is a musty brown colour.The
 metal is covered in dried blood,and   
 is a reddish colour.Fixed on top of   
 each compartment is a small piece of  
 twisted wire tied in a{noose}in  a{   
{slip knot.                            
   When the mouse is tempted by the    
 cheese he puts his head through the   
 noose and walks towards the cheese,and
 chokes to death.                      
   The most mice the Cookes have caught
 in one night is four.
