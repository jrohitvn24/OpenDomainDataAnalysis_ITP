		<content> On either side of Island Road, which  
is an old Roman Road, there are 3      
ancient burial grounds i.e. Roman,     
Anglo-Saxon and Iron Age. There are    
rumours of the ghost of a headless     
Roman Soldier said to wander round     
the Convent and the old burial         
grounds. Also at the Swan Public House 
in the village there is supposed to be 
a ghost of a smuggler who was arrested 
on the premises and hung in            
Canterbury. A popular Kentish          
pastime is "bat and trap" which is     
played in the public house gardens.    
Another pastime is a shooting range,   
owned by "Greenfield and son",         
situated on Sturry Hill. It is one     
of the five clay pigeon ranges in Kent 
and so attracts people from a large    
area. People nearby complain of the    
noise.                                 
                                       </content>
