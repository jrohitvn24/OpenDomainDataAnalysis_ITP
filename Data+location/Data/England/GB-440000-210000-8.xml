The church is about 100 years old      
built 1869). We entered under the lych 
gate which is for resting the coffin   
when it's raining. In the graveyard    
there were a lot of graves and we      
looked at those of the Taunton family, 
local landowners who gave money to     
build the church and school. These     
graves are nearest the church. There   
is also a war memorial. The windows    
look dull from outside but inside we   
saw that the windows were stained      
glass. The inside is very colourful as 
there are also a lot of wall           
paintings.  In the vestry we saw       
photographs of all the vicars since    
1888, and on the wall near the door is 
a list of vicars since the foundation  
of the church. There is also near the  
door a memorial to Lt.Taunton who      
died fighting in the 1st World War.    </content>
