		<content>{WESTON-cum-WEEDON}is a small village  
 of great interest; the Old Manor House
 or Armada House is so named as it was 
 built in 1588, year of the abortive   
 Spanish Armada Invasion.  Amongst the 
 prettiest cottages is the old Post    
 Office &amp; Stores - now closed, &amp; Garden
 Cottage, being among the remaining    
 three thatched cottages.  Early 16th. 
 Century records show the old Weston   
 Hall as belonging to the Ovetts; the  
 present Hall was built by the Hiccocks
 &amp; passed through the female line until
 it was bought by Sir Sitwell Sitwell  
 from his wife's father Col. Hely      
 Hutchinson.  It remains in the Sitwell
 family to this day.  Those parts of   
 the estate not owned by the Hall      
 belong mainly to St. John's College,  
 Oxford, being part of the endowment &amp; 
 the old stone farmhouses are now      
 rented although retaining their charm.</content>
