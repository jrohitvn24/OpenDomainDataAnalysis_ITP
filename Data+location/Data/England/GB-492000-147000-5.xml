		<title>05WANBOROUGH CHURCH AND BARN</title>
		<content> Wanborough is a small hamlet with a   
 church built in the time of the       
{Saxons.}It was destroyed by the{Norman
 invaders but rebuilt by the monks of  
 Waverley Abbey. It was damaged again  
 by the soldiers of{Henry VIII}and     
 there was a secret passage to the     
 nearby manor where two priests holes  
 have been found.                      
                                       
 It fell into disuse and was used as a 
 workshop until{1861}when the church   
 was reopened.The old{tythe barn}close 
 to the church was built by the Monks  
 of Waverley Abbey and is one of the   
 finest in the county. It has crown    
 posts and ancient beams but now holds 
 grain drying machinery. The name      
 Wanborough is said to come from a     
 local barrow where bronze age people  
 buried their dead -{"Wenberge".
