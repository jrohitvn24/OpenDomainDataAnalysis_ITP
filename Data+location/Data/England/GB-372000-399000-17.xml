		<title>17More About the Houses</title>
		<content> The houses round our school were      
 mainly built in the 1960s and 70s.    
 There are a lot of semi-detached      
 bungalows (many with dormers), built  
 from red brick with tiled roofs. Those
 with garages had them at the back or  
 side. Most of them had gardens which  
 were small at the front and large at  
 the back. Many of them had lawns with 
 flower-beds around the edge.          
                                       
 The newer buildings were detached and 
 semi-detached houses built of lighter 
 brickwith tiled roofs. Very few had   
 double garages, as the incidence of   
 two car families was low.             
                                       
 Amenities in local housing include:   
 central heading (mostly gas), double  
 glazing, ownership of a car, freezer  
 and a TV. Most cook by electricity.
