		<title>08Mr.Whittle's Farm (cont.2)</title>
		<content> ready by 7.00 a.m.To do the work.He   
 used to have eight workers,but he's   
 only got two now because of           
 technology.One of the reasons that he 
 does not have eight men is  he has an 
 automatic potato harvester.When they  
 used to have an elevator digger they  
 had to have about twenty hand pickers 
 which were usually women.His two      
 skilled tractor drivers are,Bill Farr 
 and Glen Prinold. Mr. Whittle's has a 
 secretary who comes once a week.
