 The school was built in 1869, the     
 front part is 116 years old, and the  
 new extension is 13 - 15 years old.   
 There are four classrooms, an activity
 area where we cook, paint or work on  
 our computer. We have a playground and
 an adventure playground with climbing 
 frames and stepping stones. In the    
 summer we go in the seimming pool.    
                                       
 Our school has a headteacher and three
 other teachers who all come to school 
 by car. We have 80 - 90 children who  
 start school when they are 5 years old
 and go on to Kirdford School when they
 are 8.
