		<title>15 WEEDON'S HOUSES</title>
		<content>  Most of the older houses in Weedon   
are made of brick with slate roofs.Some
of the oldest houses are made of stone 
and may have thatched roofs.Recently   
two large houses in Church Street had  
their thatch replaced with tiles.      
  The older houses can be found in the 
High Street,Church Street and much of  
Upper Weedon.The oldest house is       
thought to be {The Old Priory},Oak     
Street.                                
  The modern houses in Weedon are      
smaller and neater,they are all built  
of brick and tile.Most of them are on  
the {Regents Park Estate},built on the 
site of the {Royal Pavillions}.Another 
much smaller estate is centred around  
St. Peter's Way.                       
  The only houses being built or       
planned at the moment are in West      
Street and on the site of the {Royal   
Military Depot}.                       </content>
