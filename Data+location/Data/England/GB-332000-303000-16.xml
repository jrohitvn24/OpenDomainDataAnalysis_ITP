		<content>  Group Four is the name give to a     
 co-operation scheme involving the four
 local schools, Minsterley, Hope,      
 Stiperstones, and Worthen. Although   
 separate schools the four schools join
 together for the benefit of the       
 children when this seems most         
 appropriate. Areas covered include    
 games, sports, drama, swimming, music,
 and environmental activities.         
 All the children from the youngest to 
 the oldest are involved in some part  
 of the programme, and the facilities  
 of every school are used as needed.   
 This scheme has been in operation     
 since 1977. When competitive          
 activities are undertaken the children
 compete for a team rather than their  
 own school - red, green, blue, and    
 yellow. Each child remains in that    
 team throughout its Group Four time.
