 School has a long history. According  
 to records there was a school in the  
 village in 1500. In 1632 a Commission 
 of Charitable uses found that property
 in the area "had been long thereto    
 given for the maintenance of a free   
 school". The trust funds are now      
 administered by the Chaddesley Corbett
 Educational Foundation and the school 
 is designated a Voluntary Aided School
 Children are admitted when they are   
 rising five and normally transfer to  
 Sladen C.of E.Middle School

 birthday. There are approx. 40        
 children on roll and on average 10    
 children are admitted each year.
