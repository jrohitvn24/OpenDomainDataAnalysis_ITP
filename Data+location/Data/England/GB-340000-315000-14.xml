		<title>14PARACHUTING - ARGUMENTS FOR</title>
		<content> As working hours are reduced and      
 unemployment rises, there is a greater
 demand for leisure facilities of all  
 kinds.                                
                                       
 Parachuting is becoming an            
 increasingly popular sport and we are 
 fortunate to have the space and       
 facilities available locally.  The    
 parachuting centre has been developed 
 on an abandoned airfield and so good  
 use is being made of disused land.    
                                       
 The sport provides an exhilarating    
 experience and a great deal of        
 pleasure for a large number of people.
 It can also produce a fascinating     
 spectacle for people in an area where 
 sporting facilities are rather        
 limited. This activity has also raised
 considerable amounts of money for     
 charity.                              </content>
