AKELEY FIRST SCHOOL is C.of E. volun-  
tary controlled, taking children from  
5 - 9 years.  Some of the local chil-  
dren attend Akeley Wood School at 4.   
Classes are small, 36 children, 2.1    
teachers and a half day helper.  There 
are two linked classrooms, hall/dining 
area and playground.  Aims are to teach
basic skills of literacy, language and 
numeracy, encourge self expression and 
develop full potential.  School is a   
busy, happy place where children learn 
without pain.  At 9 they transfer to   
middle school where they take the 12+  
exam and if successful go to Grammar   
School, otherwise the Secondary Modern 
which worries some parents who transfer
them at 11 to Brackley Comprehensive or
pay for private education.
