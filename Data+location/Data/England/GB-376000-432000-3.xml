    Read           871      1525       
    Simonstone     618      1828       
 In 1951 most adults in Read worked in 
 the two active cotton mills and lived 
 in the terraced property, or farmed.  
 In Simonstone many adults travelled to
 Padiham and Burnley for work.  Since  
 1951 a small council estate has been  
 built in Read but large numbers of    
 expensive detached houses have been   
 built in both villages, occupied      
 largely by business and professional  
 people some of whom travel over 20    
 miles to work.                        
 The primary schools have both been    
 enlarged because the new property is  
 largely occupied by young families.   
 Until the 1970's Simonstone,to        
 preserve its social superiority, had  
 no street lighting to deter           
 undesirable visitors from Padiham!    </content>
