		<title>14FARMING</title>
		<content> There are many farms that work this   
 area.All are mixed farms,covering some
 one hundred and sixty six acres,mainly
 producing cereal  crops and           
 potatoes.Some of the land is used for 
 producing  arable grass.This is cut   
 and harvested and stored to make      
 silage for winter fodder,for the      
 barley bulls.These only play a small  
 part in the economy of the            
 farm.A small section of land is       
 unsuitable for crop growing,because   
 the ground stays too  wet so this is  
 kept for open meadow.The next largest 
 farm,120 acres,operates in much the   
 same way.However this farm has a flock
 of 52 sheep and lambs.The smallest    
 farm keeps quite a lot of animals,in  
 all there are 24 horses,30 chickens   
 and 4 dogs.The farm also has a good   
 collection of machinery.
