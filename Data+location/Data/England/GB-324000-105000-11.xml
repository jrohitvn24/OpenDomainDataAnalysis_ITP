		<title>11HOUSING COTLEIGH/STOCKLAND.</title>
		<content> There are 12 council houses in        
 Cotleigh.Farms are scattered,         
 consisting of up to 400 acres, the    
 majority being from 50 to 100         
 acres.Some farms have been sold to    
 retired people and the land sold to   
 other farmers.Cottages are also bought
 and extensions added.These are then   
 priced too high for local people to   
 buy and so the area contains a large  
 number of retired people.New housing  
 is restricted to agricultural needs.  
 There are a number of thatched and cob
 houses, some of them                  
 medieval,although increasingly thatch 
 is being replaced by tiles,due to the 
 exceedingly high cost of rethatching.
