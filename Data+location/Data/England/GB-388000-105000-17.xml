		<title>17Blandford Camp</title>
		<content> Major Harfield author of'Blandford &amp;  
 the Military'met us at the camp.We    
 noticed'Mercury'on a picture.He was   
 standing on a globe.Mercury was the   
 winged messenger of the Greek Gods &amp;  
 he was chosen as the Royal Corps      
 Signals emblem in 1875 because they   
 send messages all over the world.A    
 1000 officers &amp; soldiers &amp; 370 staff  
 (civilian) work there now.Building of 
 the present day camp started in 1963  
 &amp; the School of Signals moved here in 
 1967.Racedown Road reminds us of the  
 old Blandford Race Course.We got off  
 the minibus in a Car Park surrounded  
 by trees.We walked through a field of 
 yellow flowers.We saw the gymnasium,  
 medical centre,NAAFI shop &amp; Garrison  
 Church.We ended up in the Museum where
 we noticed the old Cable Wagon drawn  
 by a six horse team.
