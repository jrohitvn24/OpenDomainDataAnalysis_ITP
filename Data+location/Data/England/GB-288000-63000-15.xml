		<title>15A Old House in Ellacombe</title>
		<content>    I live at 31 Warbro Road. It is a  
 very busy road. My house is quite     
 near to six schools: St.Margaret's    
 Primary, Ellacombe Primary, Westlands 
 Bilateral - Lower and Higher,         
 Homelands Infants, and Babbacombe     
 Primary.                              
    The house is about a hundred years 
 old. The walls are made of granite.   
 The roof is now grey tiles but these  
 were put up only a little while ago to
 replace the old slate. We also have   
 new double glazed windows to make the 
 house warmer and to cut down on the   
 noise.                                
    I have a small back garden and     
 there is a lane behind our garage.    
 Next door there is an old shop where  
 my dad's friend lives. Close by there 
 is a park, Plainmoor shops, the       
 swimming pool and Torquay United      
 Football ground.                      </content>
