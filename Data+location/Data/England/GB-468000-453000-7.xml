		<title>07Sunday at Home-Stamford Br.</title>
		<content> On sunday I get up,get dressed,go     
 downstairs and have bacon and eggs.   
 When I finish I ride around the       
 estate.After that I watch a James Bond
 film or I play on a mud pile.I go back
 and have tea.Then I play on my        
 synthesiser for a'pop'tape Michael and
 I are making. Then I read and go to   
 bed.I like Doctor Who books.          
  My mum cooks all the meals.My        
 favourite food is cheese burger and   
 chips.My dad's is  cauliflower cheese 
 and my mum particularly likes         
 sausages.                             
 I have some chores to do each day.I   
 have to tidy my room because it  gets 
 untidy .                              
 I have a pet cat called Angel.It is 14
 years old and I like it very much.It  
 sleeps in my bath,when of             
 course,there is no water in it.
