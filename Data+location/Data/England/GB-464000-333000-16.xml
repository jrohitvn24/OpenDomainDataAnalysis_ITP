		<title>16MINERS STRIKE</title>
		<content> I haven't got a dad so he couldn't be 
 on strike or not but every day we     
 heard a lot about the strike on       
 television and in the papers. One day 
 the television cameras came to        
 Cotgrave and a big meeting was held in
 the Welfare Hall. The striking miners 
 and the ones at work were on the      
 television and had an argument. They  
 could never agree. My grandmother gets
 free coal from the pit                
 because her husband was a miner. One  
 night most of her coal was stolen by  
 striking miners who had no coal. The  
 next day she told the police but they 
 could not find the coal.The strike    
 went on for over a year.              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
