		<title>14       Being a Guide</title>
		<content>  I go to 2nd Chalgrove Guides and its 
on Friday,7p.m. till 9p.m. and I've    
been on camps as well.On thinking day  
(February 22nd) the day the guides     
started and Lady Baden Powell made up  
the idea.Because Lord Baden Powell made
up cubs and scouts,Lady Baden Powell   
made up brownies and guides.           
  The initials B.P.stand for BE        
PREPARED and Baden Powell;you can      
start brownies at 7 until you are 10.In
guides you have to make bedding rolls  
and pitch tents and cook and you do    
badges and games.I have 10 badges and I
am in Thistle Patrol and there's       
Bluebells,Snowdrops,Orchids and Forget 
Me Nots as well.
