 considerable numbers of business      
 activities in the village including   
 2 Caravan sites,a Riding Centre,a     
 small woodyard and several B&amp;B.

 Malton and Pickering as well as at    
 the Goverment Radar and radio         
 establishments at Fylingdales and     
 Irton Moor (transport porovded).      
 Most people work in offices and       
 shops as there are very few           
 factories in the area.                
 Although thre is a regular bus service
 to Scarborough and Pickering (Hourly  
 during all the day) most of the       
 commuters travel by car.              
 Although there are few farms in       
 Snainton several people in the village
 work at jobs related to farming e.g   
 contract work and machinery.
