		<title>02TOURISM IN BROADWAY</title>
		<content> The village of{Broadway}is often      
 called{'The Gateway to the Cotswolds'.
 Its delightful main street, lined on  
 either side with mellow stone cottages
 and shops, is crowded with tourists   
 for much of the year. Hotels and guest
 houses abound, the most famous hotel  
 being the{Lygon Arms}where visitors   
 may sleep in four-poster beds and     
 sample the delights of a traditional  
 English country inn. The village      
 shopkeepers cater for tourists by     
 offering a wide variety of high       
 quality British made goods. The       
 neighbouring village of{Willersey}is  
 equally delightful with its famous    
{duckpond.}It too boasts picturesque   
 stone cottages. The lovely church of  
 St. Peters lies hidden from the main  
 road.{Broadway}and{Willersey}are      
 typical Cotswold villages. Traffic    
 congestion is a problem in{Broadway.  </content>
