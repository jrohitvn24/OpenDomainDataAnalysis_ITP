		<content>Our school, {Bournville Infants} was   
built 75 years ago, about 4 years after
the{Junior School}next door. They were 
built by {Mr George Cadbury} because   
his wife, {Dame Elizabeth,} wanted the 
young children to have a local school  
without having to travel to Selly Oak  
or Kings  Norton. We have a {special   
holiday} called {Founder's Day} on the 
last Friday in June each year to       
celebrate Dame Elizabeth' birthday.    
The two schools lie along one side of  
the{village green.}From the windows we 
can see St. Francis' Church and the    
shops. Some of the older children go   
to Dame Elizabeth {Secondary School}   
nearby in Woodbrooke Road opposite     
the yachting pool. Up the hill from    
our school, at the corner of The       
Green, is the{Art College}and running  
along the third side of The Green is   
{Bournville College of Education.}     </content>
