		<title>11SPEED CHECK</title>
		<content>We saw that many vehicles appeared to  
be ignoring the 30 mph speed limit in  
the village and so we set out to check 
on this. We measured out 100 yards and 
put a cone and a person at each end. 1 
person put his hand up when a vehicle  
went by and the person at the other end
started a stopwatch and when it reached
him  he stopped the watch. When we had 
timed for half an hour we typed the    
results into our computer and then     
worked out the speeds. We did this at  
different times on different days.     
{CARS} 90 cars; 34 went over the limit,
       the top speed was 45.4 mph.     
{VANS} 28 vans;  7 went over the limit 
       the top speed was 40.9 mph.     
5 BUSES, 17 LORRIES, 4 TRACTORS &amp; 1    
MOTORBIKE were within the limit.       
{N.B. One day the limit went down to 20
mph, loose chippings on the road, and 7
out of 19 CARS exceeded it.}           </content>
