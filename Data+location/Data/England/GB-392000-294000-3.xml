		<title>03Junction of two Main roads</title>
		<content> At the North West of our survey area  
are two main roads.   They are the     
Birmingham New Rd &amp; the Parkfield      
Rd. The Birmingham New Road is being   
made wider.   There are not many       
Pelican crossings so it is dangerous to
cross the main road.   There are many  
traffic lights along its length so     
there are not many crashes.   In the   
morning and evening these main roads   
are very busy.   There are lots of     
small side roads in the vicinity and   
sometimes these get busy as well, as   
people take short cuts.                
 I live on the Birmingham New Road.    
It is very busy and noisy and when the 
cars are at the filling station you can
smell the petrol.   I think that there 
should be more pelican crossings making
it easier for people like me to cross.
