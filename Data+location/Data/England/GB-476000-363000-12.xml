 Trent. In 1878 the present Methodist  
 Chapel was established in the village.
           The present minister is the 
 Rev. G. Middlemist.He lives in        
 Southwell.On average only 16 people   
 attend each week. There are 10        
 children in the Sunday School.        
           There are no clubs or       
 societies attached to the chapel,but  
 some social functions take place      
 there.                                
      In 1960 a new Methodist hall was 
 built with interesting stained glass  
 depicting the village mill.           
      The hall is currently used for   
 chapel events,clinic and play group.It
 may also be hired for private         
 functions.
