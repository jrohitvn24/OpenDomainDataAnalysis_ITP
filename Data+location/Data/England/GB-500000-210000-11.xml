 because it is beautiful &amp; quiet.They  
 care about the well-being of their    
 VILLAGE.  They are a farming family.

 for 46 yrs. It was built by Lord      
 Brownlow in 1876. They have never     
 moved within the area. There are 7    
 other people in the family; their son,
 daughter and 5  grandchildren.

 his daughter's FARM which is within   
 walking distance of their home. The   
 Elders are interested in the Buddhist 
 monastery recently established in the

 COMMUTERS and only 2 labourers left.  </content>
