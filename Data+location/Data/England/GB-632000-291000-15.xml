		<title>15Ditchingham Hall (part 1)</title>
		<content> The hall was built in 1711 in the     
 reign of Queen Anne.Its imposing      
 presence,lieing in front of a lake &amp;  
 in the centre of a park landscaped by 
 Capability Brown,makes  it one of the 
 most beautiful houses in Norfolk &amp;    
 important part of the nation's        
 heritage.In 1984 some 30,000 tons of  
 silt were removed from the lake when  
 it was cleaned out.                   
 At the same time the Hall was reduced 
 in size by eliminating the unnecessary
 -and the architecturally unaesthetic- 
 parts of the building &amp; the interior  
 was modernised in order to make it as 
 labour-saving as possible.The lead &amp;  
 slate roof was renewed &amp; the Hall is  
 now heated by straw.This recent       
 innovation enables heat to be provided
 by the waste products of agriculture.
