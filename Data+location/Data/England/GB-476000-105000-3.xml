		<title>03SOUTHBOURNE IN WORLD WAR TWO</title>
		<content>                                       
 During the Second World War,there was 
 very little bombing in Southbourne    
 but two planes crashed,one on the     
 Hermitage and one on the mud at       
 Prinsted.A lot of planes went over    
 because Thorney Island was an         
 R.A.F.airfield.Some people had their  
 own air raid shelter,but if you       
 didn't,you hid under the stairs or    
 in another safe place.                
   Children from two schools were      
 evacuated to Southbourne,despite its  
 nearness to Portsmouth.They came from 
 a High School in Wimbledon and a      
 Council School in Tooting.            
   The sirens went when there was going
 to be an air raid.When the war was    
 over,children were given mugs with    
 Union Jack flags on them.There was a  
 big street party to celebrate V.E.Day.
