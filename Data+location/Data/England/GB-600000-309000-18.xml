		<title>18Some Yaxham Clubs and Groups</title>
		<content> The children at the Primary School did
 a survey of 17 families to find out   
 what Clubs and Societies were         
 supported by their close relations.   
 Several pointed out that the children 
 spent a lot of time playing with      
 friends outside in the good weather,  
 and in watching Television at night. A
 number of young people help with farm 
 work; particularly in picking fruit   
 and in lifting potatoes. Formal sport 
 took place mainly through schools, but
 it was difficult to get into (or back 
 from) school in the evening. Clubs    
 supported included: Good Companions(1)
 Youth Club (4) Playgroup (2) Mothers  
 Union (2) Women's Institute (4) and   
 Keep Fit (4)                          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
