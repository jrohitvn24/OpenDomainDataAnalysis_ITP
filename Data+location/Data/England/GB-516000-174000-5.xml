		<content>  The piece of river between Richmond  
 and Twickenham bridges is all{swan    
{sanctuary.}A swan sanctuary is a place
 where you can't fish because the lead 
 poisons the swans .We need a swan     
 sanctuary to protect the swans as they
 are becoming rare.                    
  The river is used for{house boats}.  
 House boats are instead of houses.They
 are half boat and half house.Other    
 boats are for nomal rides up and down 
 the river .                           
{ Richmond Bridge}was built out of     
 stone .It has 7 arches and is very    
 elegant. It has a row of grand lights.
  {Twickenham Bridge}is made of        
 concrete. Before  Twickenham Bridge   
 was built there used to be a ferry to 
 take people to the other side of the  
 river. Shortly after the bridge was   
 built the ferry closed down.
