		<title>12ST. MARTIN'S CHURCH HOUGHTON</title>
		<content> This 13th. century church stands in   
 the park of Houghton Hall.Its original
 village was moved outside the park    
 gates when Sir Robert Walpole was     
 building the Hall in 1729             
 The church has long associations with 
 the Walpole family.It is famous for   
 the nine hatchments, painted wooden   
 heraldic shields,hanging in it.There  
 is some heraldic stained glass, nine  
 Walpole memorial slabs, and a fine    
 effigy of a Prior of Coxford dated    
 13O7.In 1726 the tower was built and  
 the rare weeping nave restored.The    
 North aisle is late perpendicular     
 period.The chancel arch and the nave  
 arcades belong to the earlier         
 decorated period.Four grand box pews  
 were made in 1855 for prominent local 
 families. The church now belongs to a 
 group of parishes,services are held at
 intervals and on special occassions.  </content>
