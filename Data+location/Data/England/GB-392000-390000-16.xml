		<content> Trains travel through Woodley to      
 Manchester Piccadilly via Hyde and    
 Guide Bridge.                         
 The main feature of the main road from
 Stockport to Hyde which passes through
 Bredbury and Woodley (A560) is its    
 congested nature.  Heavy traffic      
 travelling through to Sheffield has   
 increased since the opening of the M63
 junction at Portwood, Stockport.      
 Children from Arden, St. Mark's and   
 Woodley Primary Schools are heavily   
 dependant on school crossing patrols  
 because of this pelican crossings at  
 Osborne Street, Lower Bredbury and    
 Woodley Precinct help pedestrian      
 safety and are used by some children  
 at Arden and Woodley.                 
 Traffic through Romiley centre is     
 lighter, tending to be local and      
 domestic.
