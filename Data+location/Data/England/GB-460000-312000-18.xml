		<title>18Sand and gravel excavation</title>
		<content>  A compromise solution was finally    
 voted through by the County  Council  
 that ensured that any further         
 excavation would be carried out in    
 such a way that it caused minimum     
 inconvenience to the community.       
 The company was compelled by the      
 Council to carry out such procedures  
 as tree planting,water table          
 maintenance and noise and dirt        
 control. The action committee as      
 such,is in abeyance,and the residents 
 of Cossington have now formed a Parish
 Society with a much wider brief as a  
 conservation group affiliated to the  
 Civic Trust, but a Liaison            
 Group,comprising the Charnwood Planing
 Officer and members the Parish        
 Council,the Parish Society and the    
 excavating company,continues to meet  
 to moniter progress. by Mrs A.Smith
