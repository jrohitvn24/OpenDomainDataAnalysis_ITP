		<title>18A Hall Green Inhabitant</title>
		<content> Alison Ross and Trudi Ward went       
 to visit Mrs Cusworth, about how she  
 used to live. Mrs Cusworth is an      
 elderly widow. She was in a bad       
 physical condition, she couldn't speak
 all that well and she kept on         
 coughing. she had a serious chest     
 complaint called Brochial asthma. Her 
 second husband had been dead twenty   
 two years but she didn't mind talking 
 about him as she had had a happy      
 marriage. This is what Mrs Cusworth   
 said,"I've lived in Hall Green since i
 was ten months old. I was born in 1909
 and my earliest memorys of hall green 
 are that everywhere was fields and    
 there was a big country house called  
 Tanners Arms and there was a farm     
 where the co_op is. The first school I
 went to was Painthorpe first school   
 and it makes me sad to see that its   
 been knocked down.                    </content>
