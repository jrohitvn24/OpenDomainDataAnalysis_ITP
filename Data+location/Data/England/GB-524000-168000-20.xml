		<content> It's nearly big enough for an aircraft
 to fit in.Not far from my house is a  
 row of small shops.I don't mind going 
 around to the shops as they are clean 
 and the shop owners are really kind   
 and friendly which also helps the     
 shops to do a good trade.The shop     
 I like going in best is the "do it    
 yourself" shop.The old man in there is
 always cracking jokes that ancient but
 you still laugh because of the way he 
 tells them .I end up staying around   
 there for half an hour instead of ten 
 minutes.But I'm still glad because    
 soon they are going to be a thing of  
 the past,replaced by big food chain   
 stores. The only problem with them is 
 the people at the checkout haven't got
 enough time to have a good chinwag.
