		<title>10THE KNIGHTLEY WAY</title>
		<content> The Knightley Way is a public footpath
 which goes from Greens Norton to Badby
 The path starts in Greens Norton off  
 Blakesley Hill and is an exact        
 diagonal of our block.The Way is well 
 marked and thanks to the co-operation 
 of the two farmers over whose land it 
 passes is easily negotiable.The only  
 diversion is around the Caswell       
 Research Centre where there is an     
 opportunity to view a well constructed
 lake complete with wild life.Most of  
 the route is over arable land with a  
 wire fence on each side,but on        
 approaching Foxley care has to be     
 taken to remain on the route as one   
 marker sign is over the horizon.The   
 Knightley Way is a continuation of The
 Grafton Way which enters Greens Norton
 from the south-east.
