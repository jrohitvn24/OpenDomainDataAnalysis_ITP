		<title>19OCCUPATIONS IN TREGONY</title>
		<content>  The largest group of people in the   
village is the retired.There are very  
few unemployed people.Most people      
either work for E.C.C.or are           
self-employed artisans.Service         
industry constitutes the second        
largest employer with health service   
workers and others working in shops    
and offices, mainly in Truro.There     
are a few farm workers   but it is not 
a very significant source of           
employment considering Tregony is in   
the centre of a farming community.     
Currently jobs are very difficult to   
find, especially for school leavers,   
so that there is quite a high          
proportion of students studying at the 
St.Austell  Sixth Form College or the  
Mid Cornwall  College of Further       
Education.
