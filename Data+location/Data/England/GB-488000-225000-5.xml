		<content> Linslade is mainly a secondary        
 shopping area, supplying the day to   
 day needs of the local business and   
 residential community.                
 There are a well distributed number of
 grocery/general stores, opening from  
 early morning (7.30a.m.) to late      
 evening (9.30p.m.) in certain cases to
 accomodate early workers and late home
 coming commuters. There is a Sub Post 
 Office attached to one of the general 
 stores, thereby making it a more      
 viable financial proposition.         
 A small independent bakery exists side
 by side with a small branch of the    
 Co-Operative Society and there is an  
 excellent independent butcher who is  
 also a local farmer breeding nearly   
 all his own meat for slaughter and    
 selling in the shop. He also sells    
 game such as partridge, pheasant and  
 rabbits shot by local inhabitants.    </content>
