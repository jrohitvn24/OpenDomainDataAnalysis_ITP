		<title>04Watford: Some changes</title>
		<content> In our area many old buildings were   
 were being knocked down and new ones  
 built on the same site.               
 Houses near the{High St.}have been    
 cleared and a large supermarket built 
 there instead.The{Odeon}cinema has    
 been knocked down to be replaced by   
 shops.Detached houses in{Cassio Road} 
 are being replaced by blocks of flats.
 The{Peace Memorial Hospital}built in  
 1920 to replace the smaller one in    
 Victoria Road has now itself been     
 replaced by a larger hospital.        
{Holy Rood Church School}is            
 being pulled down.Our own school      
{Chater Junior}will be pulled down     
 in 1987 and replaced on a new site    
 in{Addiscombe Rd.}                    
 The whole area seems to be one of     
 a  changing land use.No building was  
 more than 100 years old.
