		<title>02Farming on the Pennines.</title>
		<content>                                       
  In recent years the farming in this  
 area has experenced a decline, as     
 several farmers have sold out to      
 nearby farmers and moved out,         
 resulting in fewer, but bigger farms. 
 The land in the area is of a poor     
 quality and the bulk of the area is   
 used for rough grazing. Farmers       
 have not attempted to improve the     
 land. Such land is only suitable      
 for sheep farming. But some but       
 some dairy cattle are also kept       
 which supply milk locally.            
 The land is too steep for the use of  
 machinery. Lower down the slopes, the 
 farm land is fenced off and used      
 either for dairy cattle or for        
 pregnant ewes and new_born Spring     
 lambs.The nature of the farming does  
 not offer much employment to people   
 outside the families of the owners.   </content>
