		<content>  There are several pubs in the area,  
 typical of these pubs is the Oasis.   
  The Oasis public house is situated in
 the North_East corner of Roseberry    
 Square Shopping Centre to cope with   
 demand from the new estates built     
 nearby.                               
  Being a working mens pub,beer is 3   
 times as popular lager and cider.The  
 public drink about 3600 pints a week, 
 the 60 regulars drink about 2 thirds  
 of it.The house is owned by a company 
 (The nation wide group.)Deliverys come
 once a week(about 500 gallons).They   
 always have a supply lasting about 10 
 days.An interesting feet is that the  
 younger generation prefer cider to    
 beer.These basic facts seem to be the 
 same throughout all the pubs in this  
 area.
