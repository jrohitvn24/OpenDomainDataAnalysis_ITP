		<content>   For our{Domesday Survey}we have     
 attempted to present a picture of     
 Chandag Junior School in 1985.        
  It has taken us a month of hard work 
 to collect this information.We have   
 tried to make our description of what 
 it is like to live in Keynsham as     
 detailed as possible.We have completed
 hedge,land use and house surveys as   
 well as describing two local events   
 i.e.the hospital fete and the school  
 fair.We have also included a          
 description of a walk to Chewton      
 Keynsham,three accounts of what it is 
 like to live in Keynsham in 1985 and  
 some information about Keynsham       
 Cricket Club.
