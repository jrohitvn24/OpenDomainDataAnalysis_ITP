		<title>03Thornes Park,Wakefield(cont)</title>
		<content> When asked some people felt the park  
 was spoilt by litter, a big school    
 centrally situated in it and the lack 
 of more play facilities for young     
 children. There are some interesting  
 places in the park.{Holmfield House   
 now provides refreshments, a          
 conference centre and gardens and     
 rockeries to sit in.{Thornes House,   
 built between 1779 and 1781 for a     
 wealth cloth merchant called{James    
{Milnes,}was partially burnt down in   
 1953 and now houses a school of the   
 same name. Finally, Lowe Hill is a    
 major feature of the park. Its local  
 nickname is{"Cannonball Hill".}This is
 the second highest natural feature in 
 Wakefield, the first being{Sandal     
{Castle Hill,}and was the site of an   
 unlicensed motte and bailey castle.
