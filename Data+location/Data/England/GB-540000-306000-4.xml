		<content> The Manor House, Station Road         
 The Manor House is a large house of   
 great character which was built in    
 1791.  It is a listed building which  
 means that the front of the house may 
 not be altered.  We interviewed Mrs   
 Dorothy Bunting who moved into the    
 house in 1964 when Miss Williamson    
 died.  The Manor House was built by an
 ancestor of Miss Williamson's and it  
 is said that there are as many bricks 
 in the cellars as there are in the    
 house above ground. In 1964 there was 
 no electricity or water in the house. 
 The original furniture is still there.
 The house is now heated by an         
 oil-fired Aga in the kitchen and wood 
 fires in the other rooms.  Mrs.       
 Bunting gives the top class of the    
 village school a conducted tour of the
 Manor House shortly before they leave 
 the school.                           </content>
