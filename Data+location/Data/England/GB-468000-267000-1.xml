		<content> TOURISM THRIVES BECAUSE EARL SPENCER  
 OWNS MUCH OF THIS LAND. HOLDENBY IS   
 THE NOTABLE EXCEPTION.THE GENERAL     
 LANDSCAPE IS SOFTLY UNDULATING WITH   
 MANY TREES ADDING INTEREST TO THE     
 VIEW. FROM SPRATTON,PERCHED ON THE    
 HILL CREST ONE MAY LOOK ACROSS TO SEE 
 BRIXWORTH AND CHAPEL BRAMPTON.        
 THE ELIZABETHAN PALACE AT HOLDENBY WAS
 ORIGINALLY EIGHT TIMES ITS PRESENT    
 SIZE WHEN BUILT BY SIR CHRISTOPHER    
 HATTON,LORD CHANCELLOR TO ELIZABETH I,
 AS THE LARGEST HOUSE OF ITS AGE. THE  
 SURROUNDING HAMLET OF HOLDENBY IS VERY
 UNSPOILT AND A DELIGHT TO THE EYE.    
 SPRATTON HAS MANY OLD HOUSES BUILT    
 FROM LOVELY WARM LOCAL STONE BUT THE  
 VILLAGE IS LESS ATTRACTIVE BECAUSE OF 
 THE AMOUNT OF CONTEMPORARY BUILDING.  
 THE OLD PART OF THE VILLAGE IS SITED  
 JUST BELOW THE CREST OF THE HILL AND  
 THE MODERN DEVELOPMENT SURROUNDS IT.  </content>
