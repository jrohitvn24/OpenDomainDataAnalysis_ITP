		<title>20THE  DOMESDAY PROJECT</title>
		<content> We went around the parish to get      
 information for the Domesday Project. 
 On our way up Jubilee Hill we saw     
 some Saxon mounds which were part of a
 field system. Our one industrial site 
 around here is the firework factory.  
 On the side of the road we saw a      
 little pill box that was used in the  
 war. These are rather rare now and    
 there are not many left. Around one   
 field were some little Nissen huts    
 which are semi-circular. We also saw  
 some cows in the field and most of    
 them were Fresians or Herefordshires. 
 In the distance were some silos for   
 storing grain.                        
 On the Highpost Hotel's sign post     
 there was a picture of a hanging      
 gibbet, so it was most probable that  
 they used to hang criminals at the    
 crossroads.
