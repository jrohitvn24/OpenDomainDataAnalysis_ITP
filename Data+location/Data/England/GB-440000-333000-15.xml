		<content>{FOOTPATHS:}Footpaths in the village   
 are used regularly by walkers and     
 riders.Many Elms,dead from Dutch Elm  
 disease,can be seen.One large field   
 full of wheat (because of E.E.C.      
 subsidy)was previously five different 
 fields.Evidence can be seen of{hedges 
{lost}as a result.{Hawthorn hedge}     
 formed the boundary,nettles,dogrose   
 and elderberry.The bright yellow of { 
{Oil Seed Rape}growing in one field is 
 a common sight in the English         
 countryside today due to the increased
 use of vegetable oil as opposed to    
 animal fat in today's diet.  Some     
 fields are given over to {Barley}for  
 animal feed.An electricity pylon can  
 be seen in one field and many {power  
{lines}are visible across the sky.In   
 the angle of Victoria Ave. and A52    
 by-pass are some boarding kennels for 
 dogs.{P.19 All Saint's Church Ockbrook</content>
