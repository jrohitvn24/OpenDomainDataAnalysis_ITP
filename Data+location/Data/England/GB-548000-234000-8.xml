		<content> In the area,there are two churches.The
 1st is the{St Mary the Virgin},and    
 the 2nd is the{Methodist}church in    
 Arkesden.The first church on the site 
 of St Mary's was probably built in the
 8th century.When the Domesday book    
 was written,the church was built in   
 stone.In the 13th and 14th centuries  
 different extensions were added.      
   For 200 years,nothing was done to   
 the church apart from maintenance.    
 Heavy buttresses were built around    
 1780 to hold up the east wall.Major   
 restorations were undertaken in the   
 19th century when the church was      
 finished as it stands now.In 1904 the 
 4 bells were recast and another 2     
 bells were added to make 6.
