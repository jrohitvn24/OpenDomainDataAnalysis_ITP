		<title>06EMPLOYMENT AROUND OSSINGTON.</title>
		<content>    Approximately one half of the      
 working population are employed within
 the block. These mainly consist of the
 farming community,{farmworkers}and    
{gamekeepers.                          
    The people who live in the area,   
 but work elsewhere range from         
{teachers, office workers, nurses }and 
{hairdressers}to{power station         
{opperatives.                          
    Although unemployment is a major   
 problem nationally, there seems to be 
 a niche somewhere for most of the     
 local workforce.                      
    The{labour relations}in this area  
 are quite stable, no massive strikes  
 although there are occasionly         
{repercussions}felt here from          
{industrial action}taken elsewhere.
