		<title>02A Day at Temple Newsam I</title>
		<content>     One day during the seven week     
 holidays one of my friends and I went 
 up to{Temple Newsam.}It was a very hot
 day. We had sandwiches and bottles of 
 pop.                                  
     We went around the{farm}to look at
 the animals. We found the animals very
 interesting.                          
     Then we went to the{flower gardens
 to look at the flowers. There were    
 flowers there I'd never heard of      
 before. There were some{peacocks}which
 had their wings open, which was very  
 interesting, then in the greenhouse   
 there was a little fish pond which had
 goldfish in. It was there for people  
 to throw money in to improve things in
{Temple Newsam}grounds.                
     Then we went down to the{lakes}to 
 have something to drink and something 
 to eat. (continued)
