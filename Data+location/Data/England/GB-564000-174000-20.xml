		<content> The{Fort Gardens}are on the site of   
 various forts, dating back to Tudor   
 times. Much work is being done to     
 renovate the tunnels and underground  
{Magazines}as a tourist attraction. The
 gardens are set out as a pleasure park
 with trees, flowerbeds, benches, ponds
 and a{Bandstand}.A number of cannon   
 from different periods are on display.
{The Chantry}is a very old monument,   
 used originally as a church and later 
 as{Barracks}in the fort.{English      
{Heritage}are hoping to stage different
 exhibitions. The{Gordon Promenade}runs
 from the gardens to the Canal Basin.  
 It has been renovated and offers      
 pleasant surroundings whilst looking  
 at the{River.}As you walk along the   
 river you come to the lock leading to 
 the{Canal Basin,}now used as a harbour
 for small craft. Access to the{Thames 
 is at high tide only.                 </content>
