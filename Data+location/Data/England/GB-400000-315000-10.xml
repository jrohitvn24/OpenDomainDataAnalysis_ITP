		<title>10Shooting Butts Cannock Chase</title>
		<content>  Shooting Butts was originally a      
boarding school, but it is now used as 
an{Educational Environmental Studies   
Centre.}                               
  It is still at an early stage of     
development, but it offers a variety   
of areas of study, such as mature      
woodland, a deer run, squirrels, insect
life, woodland birds etc.              
  There are 2 ponds with man-made      
islands for nesting ducks. Both ponds  
are rich in pond life with many        
different plants, insects and animals. 
  There is a nursery plantation from   
which schools are supplied with shrubs 
and trees. The same plantation provided
some of the many trees for the centre. 
  The aim is to provide an environment 
attractive to wildlife while giving    
children a chance to study nature and  
to learn to respect it.
