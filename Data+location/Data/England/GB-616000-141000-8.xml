		<content>   Conkers: Two players try to smash   
 their opponents conker which is tied  
 on a piece of string.                 
   British Bull Dog: One person stands 
 in the middle of the playground, all  
 the other children try to run from one
 side to the other, if they are caught 
 they join the person in the middle,   
 when all are caught the game is over. 
   52 Bunker: A form of hide and seek. 
 One child counts to 52 while the rest 
 hide. The idea is to get back to the  
 "Bunker" without being seen by the    
 person seeking.                       
   Other games played are Marbles,     
 Skipping, Football, Cricket, Netball, 
 and Hockey.
