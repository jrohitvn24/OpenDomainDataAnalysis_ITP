		<title>09LIVING IN JERSEY</title>
		<content>   We like living in Jersey and think  
 that it must be better than living in 
 England. The island is not as crowded 
 as the cities, and there is not as    
 much crime here. There are so many    
 beaches to go to and the sea is nice  
 and clear, and there are places to    
 visit such as the sand dunes or the   
 commons.                              
    Our parents like living here       
 because they only pay twenty pence in 
 the pound tax, and they think that    
 Jersey is a good place to bring       
 children up in. We asked some visitors
 why they had chosen to have their     
 holiday here.                         
   They all said that they were hoping 
 for lots of sunshine and intended to  
 spend most of their time relaxing.    
 They were also happy that there were  
 places to visit if the weather was not
 so good.                              </content>
