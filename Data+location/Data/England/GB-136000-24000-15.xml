		<title>15Visit to Cape Cornwall</title>
		<content> When we got in we sat down and        
 listened to Mrs James,then our prefect
 gave out our uniform.Once we had done 
 that we had a tour around the school  
 going into some of the classrooms.Also
 we were shown which door to go in and 
 out of.At 3.30 we were allowed to show
 our parents around the school.Then we 
 went back home.I enjoyed my visit to  
 Cape Cornwall and I am looking forward
 to going there.
