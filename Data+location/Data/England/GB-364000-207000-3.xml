		<title>03FORESTRY COMMISSION</title>
		<content>   The Forestry Commission, formed in  
 1919, has looked after the forest     
 since 1924. The compartmented area of 
 forest totals nearly 11000 hectares of
 which 9500 hectares grow trees. Annual
 timber production approaches 50000    
 cubic metres - about one-third        
 hardwood products and the rest        
 conifers. In addition to the growing  
 of timber, its objectives include the 
 provision of facilities for public    
 recreation and the                    
 protection/enhancement of the area.   
 All areas of the forest are open to   
 the public on foot and many waymarked 
 footpaths exist. As most visitors to  
 the forest now arrive by car, much of 
 the recreational development in recent
 years has catered for the motorist.   
 Its headquarters, at Coleford also    
 houses the Deputy Gaveller who looks  
 the area's mines and quarries.        </content>
