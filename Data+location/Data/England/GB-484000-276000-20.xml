		<title>20 EMPLOYMENT IN KETTERING</title>
		<content>                                       
Many people in Kettering are unemployed
because of the closing of shoe         
factories. Also Corby British Steel    
made men redundant. In the Evening     
Telegraph we found that there are very 
few jobs for unqualified people. So    
many young people who have no job      
experience cannot get work. Older      
people too find it difficult to get    
work these days.                       
Here are some jobs advertised in the   
Evening Telegraph                      
A qualified artist   An experienced    
sheet metal worker   A U.K. sales rep. 
Personal assistant to sales director   
Secretary receptionist   Skilled motor 
mechanic    Electrician  Hair fashion  
designer                               
Most of the advertisements said that   
you have to be qualified in some way.
