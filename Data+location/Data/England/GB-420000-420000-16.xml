		<title>16MARATHON RUNNING FOR FUNDS</title>
		<content> I watched the{London Marathon}on      
 television on Sunday 21st April 1985. 
 I was looking for my Dad, he was      
 number 193.{17,500}people entered the 
 26 mile race and{16,000}finished the  
 course and received a medal from the  
 organisers,  Mars Confectionary Ltd.  
 My Dad's time was 2 hours 31 minutes  
 and 10 seconds.                       
 He was running to raise money for our 
 school. We needed{Â£265}to pay our     
 share of the cost of installing 2{sink
{units,}with hot and cold water, for   
 classrooms 1 and 2. Everyone in school
 sponsored him and altogether he raised
{Â£664.71.}We are going to buy{musical  
{instruments}- descant recorders,      
 chime-bars and glockenspeils with the 
 extra money. We should also have      
 enough money left to buy another      
{computer.
