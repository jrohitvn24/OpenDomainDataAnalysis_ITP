		<title>20GENERAL SUMMARY</title>
		<content>In this flat Vale countryside, local   
surroundings have undergone changes:-  
trees have been decimated by disease   
and little replanting has been done.   
Changed agricultural policies are      
reflected locally:- indigenous breeds  
have been superceeded by European      
stock, some permanent pasture has been 
ploughed, hedgerows have been removed  
leaving sparse habitat for wildlife,   
the use of agricultural chemicals has  
increased, manpower has been replaced  
by machinery (1 employed farm worker   
to every 300 acres).                   
There is little local employment, but  
the villages are well situated for easy
commuting to surrounding modern        
industries in Swindon, Oxford, Didcot, 
Harwell, Wantage, Grove, and London.
