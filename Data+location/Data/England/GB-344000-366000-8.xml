		<content> As in many communities that have had  
 new housing added there is some       
 feeling of resentment towards         
 newcomers. These are gradually being  
 broken down as more contact through   
 school, church &amp; clubs is made. Most  
 people are content to be living in a  
 rural enviroment.There is some concern
 that the bus service is sparse,       
 expensive and does not run at night.  
 Some nuisance from groups of youths   
 mostly noise &amp; some vandalism.        
{SOCIAL CONCERN}Major concern to       
 Guilden Sutton and Littleton is the   
 final link between the M53 &amp; the North
 Wales trunk road which will affect the
 villages and may lead to their being  
 engulfed by Chester's urban           
 development.Maintaining the{SCHOOLS}in
 both communities has a high priority. 
 Guilden Sutton has been scheduled for 
 a new school for 15 years.            </content>
