 Peatling Magna, or Great Peatling is  
 two and a half miles south-east of    
 Countesthorpe, and nine miles south of
 Leicester centre.                     
                                       
 The village is situated in a small    
 valley, fed with water from a small   
 stream which flows through the village
 but is not seen from the street. It is
 a plain, old-fashioned village, but   
 quite attractive in its way.          
                                       
 The main activity is farming. There   
 are 8 farms in the parish of Peatling 
 Magna, all are quite old. They provide
 the village with produce, work and    
 income.
