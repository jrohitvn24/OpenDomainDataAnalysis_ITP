		<content> Entertainment in Hexham is very good  
 because there is a big place called   
 the Queens hall.It shows lots of films
 and plays.It also has a library and a 
 cafe.You can go and make things at    
 Easter time there is an exhibition as 
 well.Every year we have a festival    
 called the Tynedale festival for      
 people who want to sing.I liked       
 listening to the Tynedale festival    
 because the standards are high.Twice a
 year there is a fair.One fair is small
 but another is massive.One of the     
 rides is called Octopus which goes    
 very fast.It comes in July.There is a 
 cinama which has a bingo hall and a   
 bar.There is a nightclub called       
 Turnbulls where you can go Disco      
 Dancing they have flashey lights as   
 well.
