 from the back of a van. Another van   
 sold hardware items. About 3 bakeries 
 supplied bread. Milk was delivered in 
 bottles but extra supplies could be   
 obtained from the local farms. Most   
 people grew their own vegetables.

 grow food. Rabbit,hare,pigeon,pheasant
 and trout supplemented rations.
