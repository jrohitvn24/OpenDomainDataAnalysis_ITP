		<title>09RELIGION IN OSSINGTON (2)</title>
		<content>    Although the majority of people in 
 Ossington are{Anglicans}there are     
{Methodists}and{Catholics}resident in  
 the area.                             
    The nave of the church is filled   
 with several memorials, mostly        
 dedicated to the{Dennison}family. One 
 of the stained glass windows is in    
 memory of{Lady Elinor Dennison,}who   
 did all the carving in the nave along 
 with the Estate joiner William Mawson.
 She also carved the pulpit, did most  
 of the needlework and made the        
 vestments which are still worn for the
 Eucharist.                            
    To enter the Sanctuary you have to 
 pass under the{Rood-screen}where the  
 figures were brought back from        
{Oberammergau.}On the North side of the
 altar is an Elizabethan monument      
 commemorating{William Cartwright,}his 
 wife Grace and their twelve children. </content>
