		<title>12FORD HISTORY AND FOLKLORE</title>
		<content> Ford has very little interesting      
 history.Perhaps,although being        
 situated in the WELSH MARCHES,it was  
 too far from both the Welsh Border and
 the troubles of the Midlands.Neither  
 battle nor war has affected Ford since
 its origin in medieval times.         
 The poultry farm was once used as an  
 ammunition store. There was a large   
 pond in Butts Lane but it was infilled
 in order to provide building land.
