		<title>11Torbay Hospital</title>
		<content> My mum is a nurse at the hospital. She
 works on the Casualty Ward. She has a 
 brown uniform and the other nurses    
 wear blue.                            
 There are many accidents in Torbay    
 during the summer months when the     
 tourists come. Sometimes you have to  
 wait a long time for an operation     
 during the summer. Perhaps you would  
 have it in the autumn when the        
 tourists are not here.                
 The hospital has been made bigger     
 recently. They knocked down half of a 
 building and built a huge new section 
 with a swimming pool. The mothers have
 their babies here. They have also     
 built a new section for children who  
 need to have stitches and for people  
 who need to have operations.
