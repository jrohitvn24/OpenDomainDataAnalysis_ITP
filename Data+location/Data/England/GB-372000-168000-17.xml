		<title>17COURT FARM, LANGRIDGE CONT.</title>
		<content> The chief corn crop of the area is    
 barley as wheat requires a more       
 fertile soil, for the same reason oil 
 seed rape is not grown. Swedes and    
 turnips are grown as cattle fodder for
 the 75 cattle.Their dairy herd was    
 replaced by sheep 6 years ago. They   
 have 80 ewes,mainly Suffolk Cross     
 which this year produced l40 lambs.   
 Mr.Bowyer and his son Mr.G.Bowyer farm
 the land and employ no permanent staff
 .Mr.G.Bowyer goes to Chippenham Market
 on a Friday when necessary. Mrs.Bowyer
 Senior, used to help with calves and  
 milking,but Mrs.G.Bowyer has her own  
 career outside the farm.A few chickens
 and a house cow are kept for the needs
 of both families.They have one sheep  
 dog,3 tractors and one combine.Farm   
 cottages are no longer agricultural   
 dwellings,and now provide homes for   
 people working in Bath.               </content>
