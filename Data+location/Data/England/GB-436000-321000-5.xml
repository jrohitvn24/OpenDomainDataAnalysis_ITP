		<title>05CALKE CHURCH</title>
		<content> The present church of St Giles, in    
 Calke Park, was built in 1820. It is a
 small church standing on a hill       
 overlooking Calke Abbey with an ivy   
 covered tower over the entrance on the
 West side. The tower houses the bell  
 and harmonium. Down the short         
 aisle there are 9 rows of enclosed    
 seats. On the walls,covered to 1 metre
 high with woven rushes,are 3 tablets  
 dedicated to past generations of the  
 Harpur-Crewe family. The East window  
 is unusual in that the stained glass  
 is set in wrought iron. Throughout the
 church are candle holders as there is 
 no electricity. Surrounding the       
 graveyard is a metre ha-ha with an    
 avenue of lime trees leading off on   
 the north side, down to the abbey.    
 Services are irregular.
