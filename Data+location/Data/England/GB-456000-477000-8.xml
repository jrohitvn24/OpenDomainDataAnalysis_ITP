		<content>  Unusually for a village of its size  
 Ampleforth has two primary schools:   
 St.Hilda's (C of E) and St.Benedict's 
 (RC). Both schools take boys and      
 girls. St.Hilda's has a few more      
 children and therefore has one more   
 full-time teacher.                    
  Neither school has a uniform. The    
 school day begins at 9:00 a.m. and    
 finishes at 3:30 p.m. The three R's,  
 games, religion, art and music are    
 taught. As the same teacher takes the 
 class for the whole day the timetable 
 is flexible.                          
  Both schools take children from a    
 wide area. Most children from St.     
 Hilda's go on to Ryedale Comprehensive
 wheras an increasing number from      
 St.Benedict's go to the new RC All    
 Saints Comprehensive school in York.  
 One or two boys from both schools go  
 to Ampleforth College as day boys.    </content>
