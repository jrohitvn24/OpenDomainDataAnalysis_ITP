		<content>  There is not much in Crossens except 
 church and chapel activities such as  
 Boys and Girls                        
 Brigade,Scouts,Guides,Cubs and        
 Brownies.The church and chapel also   
 have groups for adults.Some children  
 play on the recreation ground.There   
 used to be a library on Crossens Rec. 
 but the council closed it to save     
 money.It is a pity because the        
 childrens section was very popular.Now
 our nearest library is in Churchtown  
 two miles away.Not many children      
 bother to go.Sometimes the mobile     
 library comes.There are two football/ 
 cricket pitches_the Rec. and New      
 Lane.Some boys from Crossens school   
 are in the cricket teams.There is also
 a bowling green.A Riding school has   
 opened down New Lane.
