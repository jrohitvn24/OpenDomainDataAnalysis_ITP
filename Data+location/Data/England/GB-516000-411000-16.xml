		<title>16The Village Blacksmith</title>
		<content> Stallingboroughs blacksmith told us   
 that when he worked as an apprentice  
 for 7 years he was paid 5 shillings   
 per week but now pay is Â£10 an hour.He
 came to Stallingborough in 1952 and   
 he's been here 33 years.When he came  
 he mostly repaired farm machinery.He  
 also used to shoe horses but he rarely
 does it now.In those days there was no
 electricity so every thing was done by
 hand which was hard work when you were
 smashing metal with a 14 pound sledge 
 hammer.Even the forge was hand pumped.
 Nowadays he has machinery for cutting,
 beating,welding and lifting and with  
 all these appliances he can make more 
 things in less time with fewer people.
 The work he mostly does now is to make
 and repair heavy goods vehicles.He    
 also does a lot of industrial work and
 just a little agricultural work.
