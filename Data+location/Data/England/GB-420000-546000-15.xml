		<title>15FULFORTH FARM P6</title>
		<content>   There are many sprays to choose from
  and the can be very expensive        
    eg. "Roundup" costs Â£20 per acre   
 but is considered good.               
   We had the impression that the      
 farmer had reservations about such    
 widespread use of chemicals;but felt  
 he had to use them to control weeds   
 and pests and so get good yields.     
   There were also three sheep dogs on 
 the farm (one chained outside as a    
 watchdog) ,a pony ,some goslings and a
 few chickens.
