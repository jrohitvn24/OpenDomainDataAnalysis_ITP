		<title>02POPULATION IN AREA</title>
		<content> The demographic trends in the area are
 basically downwards.  The last two    
 national censuses reveal the total    
 population falling from 529 to 488 -  
 almost 8%.  As there has been a slight
 increase in the total number of       
 houses, the conclusion is that the    
 average population per house has      
 fallen.  There are two main reasons   
 for this which can probably be applied
 nationally in reasonably affluent     
 rural areas.  The birth rate has      
 fallen so there are certainly fewer   
 children in these villages. House     
 prices have also risen considerably   
 with the result that many house       
 purchases in these villages can only  
 be afforded by  older people. Young   
 wives find the isolation and lack of  
 public transport facilities a         
 discouragement to living rurally.
