		<title>07CATFIELD VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The name Catfield may be a shortened  
 form of "St.Catherine's Field", or    
 possibly a derivation of "Field of the
 Wild Cats". It is a small village with
 a population of approximately 800     
 people. The village is surrounded by  
 fields containing crops. Many village 
 activities are centred around the     
 church and Sunday Chapel. Both have   
 Sunday schools for the children. The  
 chapel also runs a youth club. The    
 village hall, which stands next to the
 playing field, can be booked for      
 parties. It is also the home of the   
 W.I. and the Old Folk's club. The Post
 Office and public house are situated  
 on a double bend in the centre of the 
 village. Towards the by pass is the   
 industrial estate. Opposite Catfield  
 Mushroom Farm is Bleak House where    
 parties and fetes are held on the     
 lawn.                                 </content>
