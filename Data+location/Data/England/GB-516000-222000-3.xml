 pand and change the character of the  
 pub in 1982 the village community

 hold.A company was formed with 97     
 shareholders and a board of directors 
 was elected.68 shareholders were      
 directly involved with an extensive   
 refurbishment programme.It reopened on

 and press coverage.It is the focal    
 point of the village and used for     
 special village occasions and shoot   
 lunches.
