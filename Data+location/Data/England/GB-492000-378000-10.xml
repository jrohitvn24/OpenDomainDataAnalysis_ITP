		<content> The Postmistress of Scampton post     
 office is Mrs Voase.  She and her     
 husband both come from Yorkshire.     
 Before they came here they had a small
 holding of 12,000 Chickens, 300 pigs, 
 200 Ducks, 6 Geese and 5 acres of soft
 fruit.  They have two sons called     
 Jamie and Garry.  The post office is  
 stone built and it is attached to     
 their house.  Four helpers begin      
 sorting the mail out at 7am in the    
 morning.  The post office opens at    
 8.30am to 5.30pm every day except on  
 Thursdays and Saturday which are half 
 days. The post office's sections are  
 stamps, postal orders, pensions, child

 certificates.  In the general section 
 are a great selection of frozen food, 
 knitting wool, stationery, grocery,   
 green grocery, sweets and many more   
 items.                                </content>
