		<title>17ST.MARY'S CHURCH, CLIFFSEND</title>
		<content> This church was built in 1871 as a    
 Methodist Chapel and was used up      
 until the 1940's. After the War it was
 no longer used and so it was bought   
 by the Church of England in 1956 and  
 in the 1980's it was altered to give a
 porch and vestry at the back.

 The first marriage to take place at   
 St. Mary's took place this year (1985)
 as before this marriages could only be
 solemnised with permission from the   
 Archbishop.                           
 The Church, now that it has its own   
 incumbant Rev.Clinton Davies,         
  has become a thriving focal point    
 again for religion at Cliffsend.
