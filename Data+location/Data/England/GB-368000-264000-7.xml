		<content> With a scattered population of        
 approx. 120, Stanford and Orleton has 
 a strong community spirit. The feeling
 of belonging is engendered by the     
 relaxed friendly atmosphere of this   
 part of the Teme Valley.              
 Local activities are based at the     
 Parish Hall which is a converted      
 school building provided by the       
 Winnington family and financed by     
 parish activities.                    
 The local gatherings are varied and   
 well-attended and social life in this 
 community provides entertainment for  
 young and old alike at little cost    
 through the seasons.  Harvest time is 
 given special attention as locals deck
 the church with produce and after the 
 Harvest Festival Service adjourn to   
 the Parish Hall for a traditional     
 supper.                               
                                       </content>
