		<title>06STROUD GOODS SHED</title>
		<content>   Stroud Goods Shed was built by I.K. 
 Brunel in 1856,nine years after the   
 station.Attached to the good's shed is
 a Permanent Way office.There is a door
 from the office into the goods shed,  
 where up some steps there is a box    
 room to look down on the goods shed.  
   The shed and office are now         
 derelict but some things remain       
 today,like the"Wait order"post cage   
 which was used for post to Painswick  
 (BR Road) and Dudbridge (M.R.Junction)
   The goods shed, office, lights and  
 rails(together with sidings)amongst   
 other things remain today.The roof has
 been taken off,the floor is covered   
 with a green mould and some windows   
 are bricked up or smashed;it is       
 obviously derelict.The goods shed was 
 closed in the 1960's by Beeching,but  
 now there is a preservation order on  
 it for G.W.R.150 year celebrations    </content>
