		<title>05THE MILL,RADFORD.</title>
		<content> Near Radford there is a little lane   
 which is signposted{FARM AND MILL}.The
 mill was built in 1680 and later      
 knocked down and built again.Most of  
 the mill-stones were made in France.It
 is believed that the cottage was a    
 forester's cottage long ago.The flour 
 was made into bread.The mill stopped  
 working in 1943.There is a man -made  
 stream which was built long ago       
 because the ground was flooded and    
 they had to build the mill on higher  
 ground,and so had to divert the       
 stream.The baker used to sleep above  
 the ovens,which were big enough to put
 a child in.The cottage was built in   
 1580.In the orchard there is a very   
 ,very big walnut tree.There is an     
 original wall in front of the cottage.
 The mill has never been lived in      
 before.
