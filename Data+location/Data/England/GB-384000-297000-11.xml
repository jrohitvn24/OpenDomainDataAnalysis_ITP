The Outlook is the local Free newspaper
0magazine. It tells the people in      
Perton all the imformation that they   
need: For example Clubs and Socities.  
    As the Outlook is a Free magazin e 
i make its money from advertising. For 
a half page advert it would cost       
#80.00. For a full page advertisement  
it would cost #120.00. Of course you   
do not have to use such large adverts; 
the smallest the paper would take could
measure a mere six centimetres. The    
prices quoted above  have been based   
on four recent issues of Outlook(1985).
