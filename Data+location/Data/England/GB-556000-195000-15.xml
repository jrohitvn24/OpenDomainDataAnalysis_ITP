		<content> Pilgrim's Hall is situated on the     
 Ongar Road, Pilgrims Hatch. It is a   
 Regency-style mansion, set in 20 acres
 of parkland. It is a Christian        
 Training Centre for the Lamb of God   
 Community, an ecumenical organisation,
 financed by a registered charity. The 
 trust purchased the house in 1968 for 
 Â£30,000 and divided it into flats.    
 Much of the farmland is rented out,   
 but some is farmed by the community   
 itself.                               
 Between 1843 and 1860 it was known as 
 Pilgrims Hall Academy, a boys boarding
 school for commercial and upper-middle
 class families.                       
 More about Pilgrims Hall can be found 
 in 'The Private Life of a Country     
 House' 1912-1939 by Lesley Lewis, a   
 member of the family who lived there.
