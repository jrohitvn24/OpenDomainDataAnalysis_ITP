		<title>08Farming on Beeley Moor</title>
		<content> There are three small farms of under a
 hundred acres and two larger ones of  
 three hundred acres. The Hipper valley
 farms are in Beeley Parish and one    
 lies within the{Peak District National
{Park.}The other farms are in Ashover  
 parish. All are worked by members of  
 the family. There is no grouse        
 shooting on the moor as it is         
 syndicated to some Docters who find it
 too expensive to operate.             
{LOCAL MARKETS:-}two main markets are  
 used for buying and selling: Bakewell 
 and Uttoxeter. The abattoir at        
 Sheffield is used.                    
{E.E.C. RULINGS:-}two farms have been  
 affected by the E.E.C. ruling relating
 to the 10% cut in the milk production 
 and therefore have had to diversify.  
 Three farms benefit from the sheep    
 subsidy.                              
                                       </content>
