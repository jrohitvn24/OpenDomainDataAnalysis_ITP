        { Mr G. Mitchell,              
            {79, Jossey Lane,          
               {Scawthorpe,            
                  {Nr. Doncaster,      
                     {South Yorkshire. 
  The reserve was opened next to the   
 power station,because when the station
 was completed in 1960 there was a huge
 sandpit used for the foundations of an
 unbuilt cooling tower.The pit filled  
 with water and gradually formed a     
 pond.Slowly,but surely,wading birds   
 came to the pond.An artificial lake   
 had to be built and they called it{   
{Thorpe Mere}.The reserve was finally  
 opened in 1980,by{"One Man and His    
{Dog"}star{Phil Drabble}.              </content>
