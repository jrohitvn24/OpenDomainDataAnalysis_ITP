		<title>06All About Me - Joanna</title>
		<content>   My name is Joanna Inez **** . My    
Mummy and Grandad are Argentinian.     
That's how I got the name Inez because 
Grandad's sister has the same          
birthdate  as me and her name is Inez. 
   I am 10 years old.  I am 1.40m.tall 
and weigh 27kg.I stay thin because I am
a fussy eater.I have a sister called   
Caroline who is rather a pain when she 
bounces on my bed. I have the tiniest  
bedroom ever as it only holds a bed. I 
love reading and amazingly spiders! In 
fact I adore all animals and the sheep 
in the back field will eat out of my   
hand while the ewes will let me stroke 
the baby lambs. In our garden we seem  
to have a farmyard,what with all our   
pets: one dog, one puppy,14 hens, one  
cockerel,two goldfish,and a hamster.   
so I suppose it is a good job I like   
animals.My home life is great.
