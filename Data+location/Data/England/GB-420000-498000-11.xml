		<title>11Landscape in Bromp on Swale</title>
		<content>  The{river Swale}one of the fastest   
 rivers in England runs through        
 Brompton.In the river most of         
 the fish are brown trout.The river is 
 a tourist attraction and good for     
 angling. People buy houses with       
 gardens that have a good view of the  
 river. The Swale banks are getting cut
 into by the rough waters and many     
 trees get pulled into the water by the
{floods.                               
                                       
  The land near the river is mainly    
 flat fields and there is a lot of     
 building.To the south of the river    
 there is a steep{scarp}above the flood
 plain which is covered in deciduous   
 woodland.                             
                                       
  To the east extensive{sand and gravel
 deposits have been quarried away.
