		<content> LANDERMERE CREEK AND BEAUMONT CUT ARE 
 PART OF THE BACKWATERS BETWEEN        
 WALTON-ON-THE-NAZE AND HARWICH. PART  
 OF THE SEA WALL GOES ROUND THEM BOTH. 
 LANDERMERE WAS ONCE A THRIVING PORT   
 WITH A SMALL SETTLEMENT OF HOUSES AND 
 A PUB,THE KING'S HEAD, WHICH LATER    
 BECAME A DWELLING HOUSE. BEAUMONT QUAY
 WAS SAID TO BE USED BY SMUGGLERS BUT  
 HAS SINCE FALLEN INTO DISUSE.         
 LANDERMERE QUAY IS SOMETIMES USED BY  
 LOCAL SAILORS AND CANOISTS. THE OLD   
 COTTAGES ARE INHABITED, BEING POPULAR 
 WITH ARTISTS,AND THERE IS A LARGE     
 HOUSE, LANDERMERE HALL. LOCAL CHILDREN
 LIKE TO CYCLE OR WALK DOWN TO         
 LANDERMERE TO PLAY AND ANOTHER POPULAR
 WALK IS DOWN TO BEAUMONT QUAY. MANY   
 SEABIRDS CAN BE SEEN IN THE AREA.     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
