		<content> There are very few permanant pastures 
 which have escaped the plough. These  
 are now used for stock rearing &amp;      
 horses,however the destruction of     
 hedges has now tailed off &amp;           
 conservation is an important issue.   
 At various times of the year farmers  
 bring their flocks down from the moors
 for dipping,tupping &amp; shearing,a sight
 popular with the tourists. One must   
 not be in hurry as cows are moved     
 daily for milking,too &amp; from the one  
 local dairy farm. The moors are       
 heavily infested with bracken &amp; this  
 harbours ticks which infect sheep &amp;   
 grouse. Aerial spraying to control the
 growth of bracken has been tried but  
 has yet to be proved effective. The   
 Lord of the manor owns the shooting   
 rights for which pheasant &amp; other game
 birds are locally reared.
