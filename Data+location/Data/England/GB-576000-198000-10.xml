		<title>10Woodham Ferrers Food</title>
		<content> The following extracts are taken from 
 childrens' writings: My favourite food
 is chips. I prefer them bought in the 
 shops. I like eating in restaurants,  
 because of the waiters. I like most   
 meats especially turkey. I like roast 
 potatoes. I do not like ham. I like   
 eating junk food such as hamburgers,  
 hot dogs, sweets, coca cola, crisps   
 and cakes. I also like Chinese food   
 and curries. I like cereals like      
 cornflakes, rice crispies, shreddies  
 and Special K. I like honey,          
 marmalade, strawberry jam and marmite 
 on toast. I like sandwich spread.     
 Favourite drinks are tizer, cherryade,
 orangeade, lemonade, apple and orange 
 juice. I like the take aways from     
 MacDonalds. For Sunday dinner we have 
 roast meat, potatoes and vegetables.
