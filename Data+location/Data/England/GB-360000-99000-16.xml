		<title>16DANGER ON THE ROADS</title>
		<content> Most people think that cautionary     
 notices should be used in the village 
 in an attempt to reduce the speed of  
 the traffic, although some doubt their
 eeffectiveness.                       
 There are many parts of the valley    
 where the roads are felt to be        
 dangerous.  The majority of danger    
 spots  are within the village itself  
 namely  the corner by Lamperts        
 farmhouse, East Street corner by      
 Hit-or-Mis,  the bend by Waterfall    
 Cottage on the Dorchester Road and    
 Chapel Bridge, the fork road leading  
 to Cerne Abbas.                       
 On the valleey road the area around   
 Magiston Farm enterance was considered
 dangerous.  Parts of the road are in  
 need of maintenance.                  
 Surface water is sometimes a hazard.  
 There is an increasing number of heavy
 lorries using our roads.              </content>
