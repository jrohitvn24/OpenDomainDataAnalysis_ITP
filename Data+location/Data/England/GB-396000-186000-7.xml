		<title>07GARSDON FAMILY LIFE CONTD</title>
		<content>    My Father's family have lived in   
 Charlton for a great many years. His  
 grandparents lived and farmed at Heath
 Farm Charlton. After they died, my two
 great uncles ran the farm. They lived 
 at the farm for more than fifty years,
 until they moved in 1978 to a smaller 
 house on the outskirts of Charlton.   
    When they moved a local farmer     
 bought most of the land. The farm     
 house, buildings and a few acres of   
 land were sold seperately and was used
 to keep a flock of sheep and over 1000
 quails. They sell eggs to the big     
 hotels in London.
