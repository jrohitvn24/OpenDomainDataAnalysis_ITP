		<title>18Lack of amenities in Gayton</title>
		<content>                                       
Gayton has two pubs, one hotel, one    
post office, one post box, one bus a   
day and one public telephone kiosk -   
but no other amenities.                
 The village used to have two shops    
and a bakery (the only remnant of      
which is an "interesting feature" in   
one of the pubs) and other services    
such as a doctor and a blacksmith but  
these all closed down.                 
 In recent years to solve the problems 
caused by these losses in villages     
such as Gayton many services have      
become mobile. The following visit     
Gayton each week.                      
Mobile Library     Mobile Chiropodist  
Mobile Fishman     Mobile Greengrocer  
Mobile Butcher     Mobile Blacksmith   
                                       
The people of Gayton and nearby        
Tiffield also run a community mini-bus.</content>
