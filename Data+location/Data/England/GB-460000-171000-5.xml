		<title>05THEALE PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Theale Primary School was established 
 in 1833. The Rev. Thomas Shepherd who 
 died in 1814 left "the annual sum of  
 Â£20 forever for the establishment of a
 school at Theale in the parish of     
 Tilehurst: to learn the poor children 
 to read...and to instruct them their  
 duty to God as taught by the Church,  
 Catechism and excellent Liturgy".     
 Records from 1833 to 1904 have been   
 lost but log-books covering 1905 to   
 1985 are in the School's possession.  
 Searches have shown that the school   
 started with one classroom and over   
 the years expanded to 9 classrooms and
 230 pupils. The curriculum in 1985 is 
 very different from that envisaged by 
 Thomas Shepherd. Whilst reading is    
 still the most important subject,     
 children now use computers, undertake 
 environmental studies and spend time  
 on residential field-study trips.     </content>
