		<content>      Cornwall enjoys mild wet winters 
 so grass rarely stops growing, except 
 when snow, a rarity for a winter here,
 falls. Summers are hot, but often have
 a fair amount of rain and strong      
 westerly winds. These winds, which are
 usually commonplace, have caused some 
 trees and bushes to grow at an angle. 
      Many of the quite large fields   
 are crossed by footpaths, which are   
 not always signposted.                
      Although pollution in this area  
 is minimal, no part of the area has   
 been the subject of any deliberate    
 conservation project. Most of the area
 in our survey, as indicated before, is
 mainly grassland which is only        
 interfered with for grazing purposes. 
 We can therefore enjoy land that is   
 mostly well-cared for by the farmers  
 who use it.
