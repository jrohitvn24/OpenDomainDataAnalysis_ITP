		<title>19Transport in Billingshurst</title>
		<content> Only 3{bus services}operate in one    
 part of the district, 2 of which go   
 North-South. The{railway}line is also 
 North-South (London to the coast).    
 Those public transport services which 
 do exist tend to be hourly or less    
 frequent &amp; stop running around{10pm.  
 This means a heavy reliance on private
 transport, particularly for East-West 
 travel or evening entertainment. For  
 young people{bicycles}can help, &amp; many
 save for{motorbikes}but narrow country
 roads are badly maintained &amp; ill-lit &amp;
 thus unsafe at night. The{car}thus    
 dominates, choking the village in     
 Summer as people vacation in the West 
 Country, &amp; bouncing around narrow     
 lanes dodging cows, sheep &amp; potholes. 
 Small cars such as VW Golfs &amp; larger  
 ones such as BMW's &amp; Cavaliers are    
 popular and there seems some market   
 resistance to Japanese imports.       </content>
