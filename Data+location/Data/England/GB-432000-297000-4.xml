		<title>04Farming in Atterton</title>
		<content> My father is called Roger, and he is  
 a farmer. His brother is also a       
 farmer. His name is Walter.           
 My dad gets up at 6.00 am, and starts 
 work at 7.00 am. Roger has his own    
 farm up at Atterton.                  
                                       
 Walter has his own farm down at       
 Witherley. He works mostly in the     
 milking parlour down at Witherley.    
                                       
 We milk our cows twice a day, morning 
 and night. We have got 43 milking     
 cows, 1 bull and 160 other cattle.    
                                       
 We feed our cows with hay every       
 morning in the summer.In the winter we
 give the cows silage.                 
                                       
 We give our chickens corn, and our    
 ducks too. The geese have corn as well
 The little chicks have chick pellets. </content>
