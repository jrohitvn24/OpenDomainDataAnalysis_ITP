		<title>03Brief History of the area.</title>
		<content>   The area was farmland up to the 19th
 century. In the 1870s the first       
 petroleum importation began.          
   In 1895 Kynoch and company set up a 
 munitions factory here. A village was 
 built for their employees and became  
 called Kynochtown.The factory was sold
 in 1919 and the area reverted to      
 farmland, but in 1923 Cory Brothers   
 bought the site for oil refining and  
 the village was renamed Coryton. In   
 the 1930s oil refining ceased but     
 storage continued of both oil and     
 edible oil.                           
   In 1950 the site was purchased by   
 Vacuum Oil Co.(now Mobil Oil Co.) to  
 build a new oil refinery.By 1960 a    
 pipeline joined the Shell and Mobil   
 refineries for joint fire-water       
 linkage.By 1970 an expansion programme
 had led to the disappearance of the   
 village.Only the refineries remain.   </content>
