		<title>11MARBURY HOUSE</title>
		<content> The lady we visited has been a        
 resident at{Marbury House}for 8 years{
 in August.She is 89 and has lived in  
 Reddish since she was 65.She asked us 
 if the laundrette was still on the    
 corner of{Station}Rd.It is.She then   
 asked if the butchers and grengrocers 
 was still there,but they are not,     
 instead there is a furniture and a    
 Hoover shop. She said "shops are the  
 main{changes in Reddish"}and then we  
 talked about the place she lived in   
 before, Failsworth in Manchester.     
  She does not get out much, as she is 
 getting old, but still goes out on    
 trips with the home. During the day,  
 she stays in her room and reads, as   
 she says there isn't much conversation
 between the old people. Most evenings 
 she goes into a big room to watch T.V.
