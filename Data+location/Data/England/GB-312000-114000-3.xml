		<title>03Wild mammals in Blackdowns</title>
		<content> Three of the larger wild mammals are  
 present. Roe deer are so numerous that
 they have to be controlled; a farmer  
 who has a young orchard holds a       
 licence to shoot them. Several badger 
 setts are sited on the upper Greensand
 where the soil is easy to dig.Foxes   
 are numerous,and they are occasionally
 hunted by the Taunton Vale Harriers.  
 Among the smaller mammals, wood-mouse,
 field-vole, mole, shrew, pigmy-shrew, 
 grey squirrel, rabbit and hedgehog are
 common; hare, stoat, weasel and       
 pipestrelle-bat also occur. The       
 harvest mouse is uncommon, but its    
 distinctive nest has been found in a  
 tussock of Molinia grass. The presence
 of dormice has been inferred from     
 finding hazel nuts gnawed in a manner 
 characteristic of this animal. The    
 inference has recently been confirmed 
 by a cat bringing in a dormouse.      </content>
