		<content> Pendomer Church, with its squat tower 
 and fine hilltop situation, is        
 dedicated to St Roch, celebrated for  
 his devotion to healing. This is      
 believed to have been a re-dedication 
 after most of the population was wiped
 out by the plague. In the beautifully 
 kept perpendicular church is the      
 fourteenth century tomb of Sir John de
 Domer. The parish shares a rector with
 Hardington, East Coker and East       
 Chinnock, in the diocese of Bath and  
 Wells, but has regular and well       
 attended services. Pendomer has two   
 former rectories - the older is now   
 Parsonage Farm, and its Victorian     
 successor, outside the block, is a    
 private dwelling. Halstock's parish   
 church is St Mary, and it is served by
 the Melbury team ministry, along with 
 several other villages in this part of
 Salisbury diocese.                    </content>
