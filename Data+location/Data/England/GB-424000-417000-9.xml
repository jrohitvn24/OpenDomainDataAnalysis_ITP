{carpet cloth}and did a lot of         
{spinning.}When they were open there   
 were lots of jobs, but they closed and
 people became{unemployed.}            
   They{closed}because people were     
 bringing things from{abroad}which were
 a lot{cheaper.}New jobs were hard to  
 find and lots of people were          
 unemployed.                           
  {Dewsbury}has{high unemployment.} It 
 is higher than the{national average . 
 The only jobs around come from small  
 businesses which are growing up around
 the district. People are going to{job 
{centres}and looking through the{local 
{papers.}The job centre has lots of    
 jobs but most people cannot find one  
 for themselves. The local papers      
 advertise work but the{wages}are      
 small,not enough to live on.          </content>
