		<title>02FARM ON OSTWALDTWISTLE MOOR</title>
		<content>  The dairy farm we visited was owned  
 by Mr. RATCLIFFE. He has many cows and
 bottles his own milk which he then    
 delivers. The milk is pasteurised by  
 heating it up and then cooling it     
 down again before it is put in        
 bottles.                              
  The farmland is used to grow grass   
 which is cut and stored as silage     
 for the cows to eat during the        
 Winter and also grass for the cows to 
 eat during the Spring, Summer and     
 Autumn.                               
  Female calves are reared to produce  
 milk when they are older but male     
 calves are fattened up and sold to be 
 killed for beef. A full grown cow     
 costs about Â£700 and the price of the 
 tractors used to pull the implements  
 around the fields can be as high as   
 Â£20000.Houses cost about the same !!!
