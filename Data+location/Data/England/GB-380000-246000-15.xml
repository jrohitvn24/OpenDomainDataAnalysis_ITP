		<content>{The Dining Room}is used for eating    
 meals. Not every house has a special  
 room for this purpose. Many people eat
 in their kitchens.In the dining room, 
 you might expect to find a large      
 wooden dining table,usually with      
 co_ordinating chairs, that often have 
 upholstered seats.There will often be 
 a side_board, for storing drinking    
 glasses,crockery,serving dishes, table
 mats, and tablecloths.The side board  
 is often also a show place for glass, 
 china,pottery,and silver ornaments,   
 and perhaps sporting trophies and     
 plaques.The floor is usually carpeted.
 The dining room is sometimes just     
 reserved for special meals,such as    
 birthday parties, dinner parties, and 
 perhaps Sunday lunches,other meals    
 being eaten in the kitchen.
