		<title>10 A SUNDAY AT HOME</title>
		<content>    I usually get up at 7.00 a.m. My   
bed is a single bed, I have a duvet    
with plants on it. I go downstairs and 
have a bowl of cornflakes. I watch     
T.V.a.m. It is a programme with guests 
on it. After that I go to church with  
my two brothers, David and Tony.       
    Church is Catholic, we have to help
the Father. I do the incense while my  
brothers do the candles. At 11.00 a.m. 
church is over so I go to my gran's    
while my brothers get the paper. At    
12.00 a.m. I go home and have my       
dinner. We have meat, vegetables,      
potatoes, Yorkshire Pudding and gravy. 
For desert we have Apple Crumble. At   
1.00 p.m. I watch Battle Star          
Galactica. It is about two men who try 
to save earth from aliens. After dinner
I tidy my room. At 5.00 p.m. I have my 
tea. I have salad which is lettuce,    
tomatoes and cheese.                   </content>
