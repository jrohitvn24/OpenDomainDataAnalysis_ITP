		<content> Winson lies mostly in a loop road     
 which starts at the church and        
 encircles most of the village. The    
 number of residents on the            
 Parliamentary Electoral roll is 63,   
 but about one third of the houses are 
 unoccupied except at weekends. The    
 residents here are either connected   
 with farming or retired and           
 professional people. The largest farm 
 is the "Village Farm". Old Manor Farm 
 is the oldest and least altered house,
 with beautiful gardens in which       
 peacocks proudly strut. Manor House   
 used to be a farmhouse but was        
 drastically altered in 1748 to        
 resemble a Grand House in the 18.     
 Century style. Winson is rich in stone
 carving and few houses are less than  
 200 years old.
