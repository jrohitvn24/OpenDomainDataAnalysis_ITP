		<content> We chose Claire Hall,aged 10 out      
 of her 3rd year class at Belmont      
 Junior School to write about her week-
 end. She writes: On Saturdays my      
 family get up about 9.                
 We go to Redcar to shop;my Gran lives 
 there so we have dinner with her while
 my Dad does her garden. Back home     
 again I play with Vicky,who lives     
 over the road,or back-garden tennis   
 with Julie from next door.After tea   
 I watch Dynasty,then have my supper,  
 a shower and go to bed.               
 On Sundays,up at 8.30.Often we        
 pack a picnic &amp; go hiking with Jet,our
 dog.Last week we saw dead sheep,&amp;     
 dragon flies over a river.I found lots
 of pheasant &amp; partridge feathers.My   
 sister didn't come because she's re-  
 hearsing a play called Insects in     
 which she's a frog.                   
                                       </content>
