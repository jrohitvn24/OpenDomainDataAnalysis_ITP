		<content> I live at Westland Road in Cottesmore 
 village.Rachel lives near me and our  
 door numbers are 23 and 31.There are  
 three roads on our estate and they are
 Westland Road,Nether Close and Long   
 Meadow Way.Rachel's daddy has just    
 made an extension.Rachel plays with me
 on the black circle out side her      
 house.There are lots of children where
 we live and there is one play park but
 there is not much to do there.We have 
 an ice-cream man who comes round and  
 he is called Mr Softi,his real name is
 Malcolm and he comes every day except 
 Monday.We get our ice-cream on Sundays
 My favourite ice-cream is a Big Feast 
 There is  another ice-cream man who   
 comes round sometimes and if you tell 
 him that Mr Softi has been he will    
 give you an ice-cream free. There is  
 lots of woodland and we have a lovely 
 view of a field where we play.        </content>
