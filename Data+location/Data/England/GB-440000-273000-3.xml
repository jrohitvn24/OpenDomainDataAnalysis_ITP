		<title>03NATURAL HISTORY IN WOLSTON</title>
		<content>{The brook}which runs through Wolston  
 comes from two pits which have        
 spring-water (Ferry Farm) and it is   
 never known to have run dry.{The River
{Avon}runs through{Wolston Woods}and   
 the last time the children visited the
 woods they wrote "We found lots of    
 trees such as beech, yew, sycamore,   
 ash, holly, willow and Scotspine.     
 There was even a rare tree called a   
 Redwood. These trees are in the woods 
 because a long time ago they were part
 of the garden of the Old Manor House. 
 Some trees had been damaged by vandals
 who had tried to burn them. This is a 
 shame because the trees are there for 
 everyone to share and enjoy. In the   
 spring there are lots of snowdrops but
 many of these are lost forever because
 Coventry people come in cars and dig  
 up the bulbs." A{rare flower,}white   
 butterbur, was found there in 1968.   </content>
