		<content>    The  Airship  600s  now being built
 have two Porsche Turbo  engines  which
 give it a top speed of about 60 knots.
 Unlike the very  large  rigid airships
 like the R101,  the modern ones cannot
 fly  long  distances  in one go.  When
 they are sold to  another country like
 the  U.S.A.  Japan  or  Australia  the
 balloon is packed in a large crate and
 sent by sea.                          
     Airships  are now being  used  for
 advertising.   There are  points where
 the signs can be strapped to the  side
 of the balloon.   They  are  also used
 for a television camera  platform,  to
 survey remote wild areas,  or to watch
 over  fishing  fleets  at  sea.   They
 could  also  be  valuable for military
 needs as they do not show up on radar.
      If you would like one  they  cost
 about{Â£6 million pounds} delivered  to
 your door.                            </content>
