		<content>   Burgess Hill expanded rapidly when  
 the railway was built  in 1841. Up to 
 that time it was mainly a farming     
 area. Great changes have taken place  
 within the past twenty years.         
   Most housing is{owner occupied}but  
 there are some{council properties.}   
 On the fringe of the town there  are  
 some very old houses possibly from the
 Elizabethan period. Within the town   
 there are many{Victorian terraced}    
 houses, which were originally occupied
 by railway and pottery workers.       
   The landscape has been changed by   
 the construction of three high rise   
 office blocks in the centre of the    
 town, and the{redevelopment}of the    
 brickyards to a largely{pedestrianised
 shopping precinct and open market.    
 Development of new housing estates is 
 gradually eroding the open spaces in  
 and arounnd the outskirts of the town.</content>
