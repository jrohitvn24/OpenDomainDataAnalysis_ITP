		<title>02STAFFS POLICE HQ CONT. ROOM</title>
		<content>The Control Room is computerised and   
manned 24 hours a day.The people who   
work there are civilian operators.The  
Duty Officer is in control assisted by 
a P.C or a W.P.C. The telephone links  
are internal and external. On the      
console there are two lights-white for 
non-emergency and red for 999 calls.   
They don't have bells because the      
operators are often speaking to men on 
the beat and need quiet. All the       
operators use VHF and are linked to all
Police Stations and mobile patrols.    
All information is recorded on magnetic
tape.The Stafford Police are able to   
communicate with P.N.C (Police National
Computer). By the high speed data      
transmission line, data can be received
and shown on the Visual Display Unit in
4 seconds.The data is quite often about
the keeper of a car, and whether it has
been stolen or not.                    </content>
