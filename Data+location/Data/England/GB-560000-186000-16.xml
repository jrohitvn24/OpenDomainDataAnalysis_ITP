		<title>16WEST HORNDON SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   West Horndon has its own primary    
 school, which takes children aged from
 4 to 11. The school is modern, 22     
 years old, and has good facilities and
 pleasant surroundings.                
   The school has 7 classrooms. At one 
 time there were 234 children, but now 
 there are only 71 children. Only 3    
 classrooms are used for schoolwork.   
 The others are used as a library, a   
 music room, a maths and science room  
 and a play group. There are 3 fulltime
 teachers, including the head, and two 
 days of parttime.                     
   The school has chickens, ducks,     
 other birds, rabbits and a pond, which
 are looked after by the children.     
   The school has a large playing field
 and an average sized playground. There
 is also a good sized hall with much   
 P.E. equipment.
