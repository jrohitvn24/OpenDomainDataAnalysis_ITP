		<title>09HISTORIC HOUSES IN HARVEL</title>
		<content> This area has a high proportion of    
 houses over 150 years old and several 
 are listed as being of special        
 historic interest.  Several of these  
 are timber-framed farmhouses and date 
 back to the 14th and 15th Century(e.g.
 Boughurst, Swanswood, Famescott and   
 Combehill).  They have enormous       
 inglenook fireplaces and are either   
 peg-tiled or thatched.  Forge Cottage 
 dates back to 1590 and was the village
 pub until 1914.  There are several    
 conversions into interesting homes,for
 example in Harvel there are two C19   
 oast houses,the old school and a      
 timber-framed barn. The attractive    
 features of C18-19 houses include     
 white-washed plasterwork,flint        
 walling, carved brickwork and         
 clapboarding.
