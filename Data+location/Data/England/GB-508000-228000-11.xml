 Infant class has 22 pupils aged       
 between 4 and 7 years old, and the    
 Junior class has 31 pupils aged       
 between 7 and 11 years. School starts 
 at{0900}and ends at{1530.}Lessons are 
 held for 5.3 hours with three         
 playtimes during the day. All the     
 children eat lunch at school.{Most    
{pupils travel to school by car}since  
 they live in towns or villages up to  
 ten miles distant. Five children live 
 in Hexton and walk to school. Parents 
 send their children here because the  
 rural surroundings are so pleasant and
 because the school has a reputation   
 for good teaching. The recently       
 retired Headteacher and his wife      
 worked here for 26 years and enjoyed  
 the school and village so much that   
 they decided to live here permanently.
