		<title>14Bredwardine; Wildlife I</title>
		<content> The fields in the area are relatively 
 small and hedgerows have largely been 
 preserved by the farmers. There are   
 plenty of areas of undisturbed habitat
 for wildlife, including coppices,     
 small groups of neglected trees,      
 patches of bramble and gorse and      
 overgrown disused pathways. The owner 
 of a stretch of woodland on           
 Bredwardine Hill keeps it undisturbed 
 as a sanctury for wild creatures.     
 There are ponds, reed beds, and       
 marshy areas alongside the river, and 
 some small streams down the hillsides.
 Thw high-banked lanes are covered with
 a profusion of wild flowers in Spring 
 and Summer and there are berries and  
 nuts galore in the Autumn. Lists of   
 the less common species of birds,     
 flowers and animals often observed    
 here are given on Page 15.
