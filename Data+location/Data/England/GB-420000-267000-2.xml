I'm a Commuter. I drive to work in a   
petrol fueled motor car each day. I    
come home to my peaceful house in the  
country.On Saturdays I work in the     
garden.Sundays are often for visiting  
mother-in-law.I like to spend some eve-
nings at the local pub.The mortgage    
accounts for nearly half of all I earn.
                                       
 I'm unemployed. I live about 2 miles  
from Mr Commuter.No job means no       
money. The Government pay me some but  
I have no car. My house is a Council   
property which I rent.I have to be     
very careful how much I spend if I go  
to the pub.I will never get a job.     
                                       
I'm a farmer. Enforced reductions in   
milk quotas by the EEC has forced some 
of my friends to sell land or buildings
However harvests are good.             </content>
