		<title>14     A CHILD'S DAY</title>
		<content>    My name is Nerys Coward and I am   
 ten years old. I get up at seven      
 thirty and put on my school uniform.  
 Then I go down stairs and have        
 breakfast with my brother, Paul. For  
 breakfast I have a bowl of "Frosties" 
 or a piece of toast. I then brush my  
 teeth and wash my face. At half-past  
 eight I go to school on my bicycle. We
 have no cooked lunch at school now so 
 I take a packed lunch which usally    
 contains sandwiches, a biscuit and a  
 packet of crisps. We leave school at  
 three thirty-five p.m. and come home. 
 We have tea at half-past five and     
 after tea I amuse myself until I go to
 bed at nine o'clock. Usually I read   
 before I go to bed, but on Tuesdays   
 and Thursdays I am allowed to watch   
 television for about half an hour.
