		<title>16A DAY AT SCHOOL IN BRAILES</title>
		<content>   Brailes Church of England School is 
 a small school of eighty seven pupils.
   On Tuesdays the vicar comes to lead 
 morning assembly and then he teaches  
 Religious Education to the Upper      
 Junior class.From 10.35am.to 10.55am. 
 we have playtime.                     
   After play the headmaster takes us  
 for mathematics and computer work     
 until dinner time.                    
   Most of us have sandwiches but about
 thirty_five children eat school meals.
   After our dinner hour we have       
 history _ a follow up from a radio    
 programme of the day before called    
 'History Not So Long Ago'             
   For about three quarters of an hour 
 after play we do sewing or craft.When 
 we have cleared up we say our prayers 
 and go home at three thirty.
