		<title>14MILTONS COTT.CHALFONTSTGILES</title>
		<content>In 1665,John Milton moved from London  
to Chalfont St  Giles to escape the    
Great Plague.He was 58, already blind  
and having to dictate all his work to  
his daughter.Here he completed Paradise
Lost.The cottage,500 years old,the only
remaining residence of Milton,was found
for him by the Quaker,Thomas Ellwood.  
In 1887 it was bought by the Parish    
and it has been made into a museum     
which attracts visitors from all over  
the world.In his time there was only a 
ladder to the upper floor and as he    
suffered from gout he probably spent   
all his time in the two ground floor   
rooms.In these two rooms are preserved 
many relics of his life and work,inclu-
ding the manuscript of Paradise Lost   
and translations in many languages.On  
the walls are portraits of Milton.
