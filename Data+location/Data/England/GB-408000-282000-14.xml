		<title>14A Muslim Day        B'ham</title>
		<content>On a school day I get up at 7.30 and   
after a wash have my breakfast. At 8.20
my friend Shegufta calls for me and we 
walk to school. It takes 20 minutes.   
When we get there its time for         
registration and assembly. In assembly 
the teachers announce things and       
children do plays or sing. After the   
first two lessons we have a break when 
we can play games outside and buy      
sweets. There is one lesson before     
lunch. I go home for lunch and return  
to school to rehearse a Bengali dance. 
School ends at 15.30 and I go home for 
my tea. After tea I play or do my home 
-work. At 19.00 I read my Namaj and    
then I read Bengali books until 21.00  
when we read Namaj again. Namaj is a   
prayer for Muslims. We read Namaj 5    
times a day. Isha is the last prayer   
time. After I read my Isha Namaj I go  
to sleep.                              </content>
