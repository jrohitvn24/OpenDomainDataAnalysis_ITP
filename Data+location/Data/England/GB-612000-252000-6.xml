		<content> Like most rural village areas in the  
 80's, shops are few and far between   
 whereas up to a few years ago there   
 were 3 grocers, 3 butchers, bakers and
 other stores in Coddenham village     
 alone. Now the traditional family     
 grocer's shop in Coddenham serves the 
 area in an excellent old-fashioned    
 way, with a varied stock of groceries,
 confectionary, frozen foods, wines,   
 spirits and fresh vegetables. The     
 owners and staff give first class     
 personal service to customers, high-  
 lighted in Feb. 1985 by the store     
 being nominated for a bouquet award   
 from Anglia TV's "Checkpoint" consumer
 watchdog programme, by a grateful     
 customer residing in a nearby village.
 She had enjoyed a free fortnightly    
 delivery service for 65 years without 
 ever setting foot in the shop until   
 the visit to present the award.       </content>
