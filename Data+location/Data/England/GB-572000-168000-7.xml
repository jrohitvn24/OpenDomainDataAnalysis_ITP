		<title>07ROCHESTER IN 1985</title>
		<content>  Rochester is quite a famous place for
tourists.  We have a lovely castle that
was built by the Normans.  You can go  
in and have a look and you can go right
to the top.  It's 25p for children and 
50p for adults.  We have a nice        
cathedral set in beautiful grounds.    
We have two  museums, one is the       
Guildhall and the other is the Dickens 
museum.  l have been to both a few     
times.  We have a nice little town but 
some of the shops have a modern look   
to them and it spoils all the old      
ones.  On Friday we have a big         
market,and restaurants and tearooms    
get very busy.  Anybody who is passing 
by Rochester should come and have a    
look - it is a pretty town and is worth
a visit.
