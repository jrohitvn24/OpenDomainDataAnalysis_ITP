		<title>18Employment in Morwenstow</title>
		<content> The largest  single  employer  without
 doubt  is {CSOS,}but  the  specialised
 nature of the work and  lack of nearby
 housing makes  it necessary to  travel
 into the area to work although many of
 the  staff  have been  recruited  from
 further away. Agriculture, tourism and
 trades related to the upkeep and      
 maintenance of buildings and machinery
 account  for  most  of  the  remaining
 employment.    The smaller numbers now
 required for farm work means that work
 has to be sought away from home.      
 Among these the area can claim nurses,
 schoolteachers, engineers, doctors and
 social workers as representatives.    
 Reminders of bygone industry still    
 remain with the once busy corn mill at
{Coombe}and memories still alive of the
 blacksmith's shop in the hamlet of    
{Woodford}and the old quarry at nearby 
{Beacon Down.                          </content>
