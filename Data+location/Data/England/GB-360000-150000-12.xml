		<title>12Emborough's Cheese Factory</title>
		<content> This has been privately owned for 26  
 years.  The milk is locally produced  
 and the cheese traditionally made by  
 hand and machine.  This cheese is     
 marketed locally but nationally       
 distributed.  Twenty eight farms      
 provide the milk some of which are    
 owned y the dairy.  At the present    
 time 9-10 tons of cheese are made     
 every day.  The process from milk to  
 cheese takes about 5 hours.  The      
 cheese is then stored for about 7     
 months to mature.  The Whey from the  
 cheese has the last of the cream      
 extracted and this is made into whey  
 butter which is used for blending.    
 The whey is finally fed to the pigs   
 kept nearby and reared for pork and   
 bacon.
