 Sarah and I walk down to our house for
 lunch.We've got chips,baked beans and 
 fish fingers.After lunch we go outside
 and play on the Slip and Slide, which 
 is a long piece of plastic with water 
 running down it.Sarah goes down and   
 says "It's freezing but brilliant!"   
 We take turns for about half an hour  
 until we get bored.Then we go and     
 sun bathe,we would like to have a     
 tan.                                  
 Sarah's mum comes to collect her.     
 Sarah's mum asks if I would like to go
 back with them.We play for about an   
 hour on the swings and trampoline.We  
 have tea and then Sarah's mum takes me
 home.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
