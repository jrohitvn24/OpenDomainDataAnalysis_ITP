		<title>11Bawcombe Cottage Bradstone</title>
		<content> Approached by private road, the       
 cottage commands a magnificent view   
 over the Tamar valley and rolling     
 countryside to Bodmin Moor. The fifty 
 year old cottage has electrictiy and  
 telephone but private water and       
 drainage. Owner occupiers are a       
 retired farmer who came from North    
 Cornwall and farmed at Bowcombe for 40
 years, his Plymouth born wife who     
 teaches at Lifton CP school and his   
 mother. Happy and active they neither 
 envisage nor desire change, but       
 emphasise concern at unemployment,    
 loss of traditional values &amp; lack of  
 education for leisure. The surrounding
 farmland belonging to Bawcombe Farm   
 supports milk herd and sheep. Mainly  
 grassland, some arable and deciduous  
 woodland. Origin of partly demolished 
 obelisk unknown.Could have been marker
 stone of Hayne/Lifton Park estate.    </content>
