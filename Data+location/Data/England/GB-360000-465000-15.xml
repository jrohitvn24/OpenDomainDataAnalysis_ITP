		<content> At Higher Broadwood Farm, there were  
 110 sheep, 175 lambs, 40 cows, 18     
 bulls, a sheepdog and a Jack Russell  
 terrier. The milk is bought by the    
 Milk Marketing Board and collected by 
 a milk tanker. Every year about ten   
 old cows are replaced by ten new      
 calves. Animals for slaughter are     
 taken to Lancaster.                   
 In summer, the animals eat the grass  
 in the fields but in winter they eat  
 silo which is grass kept fresh by     
 covering and making it airtight under 
 a tarpaulin. It is cheaper and easier 
 to make than hay, though hay is also  
 made.                                 
 The farm has 100 acres of land. The   
 field names include: Top Meadow, Far  
 Seeds, Holme, Meadow below t'road, Cow
 Pasture, Sandersons, Dodgsons.
