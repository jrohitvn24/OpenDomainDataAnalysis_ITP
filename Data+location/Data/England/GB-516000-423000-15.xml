		<content> Some of us go home for our dinner but 
 others stay at school for their       
 dinners.We line up out side and get   
 counted. After a minute we set off for
 the village hall to have our          
 dinner.After dinner we walked back to 
 school.At half past twelve we got back
 to school and played rugby we won     
 10_5.Then we went in to work. The work
 we were doing about was the Domesday  
 Project .Slowly the minutes ticked by 
 and it became 2 o'clock play time. We 
 went out to play rugby it was a tiring
 game but we lost so we went in to some
 more work .At 3 o'clock we had a story
 until half past 3.We got told that if 
 we were wearing indoor shoes we could 
 go home.A few of us went home then the
 rest went home.After going home I     
 called for my friends Anthony and     
 Stephen.Then we went to our secret    
 den.                                  </content>
