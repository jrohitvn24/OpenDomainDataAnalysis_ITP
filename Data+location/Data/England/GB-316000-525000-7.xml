		<content>   There are not many{roads}at all in  
 this block.The 'main' one is          
{Whinlatter Pass,}part of the B5292,   
 which links Lorton and Braithwaite    
 near Keswick.It mainly goes through   
 fells and forest.There are two disused
 stone quarries alongside it,but hardly
 any houses.Sometimes,in winter,it is  
 closed because of{snow and ice.       
   The only other roads in the block   
 are in the village of High Lorton,plus
 the 'old road' which goes from the    
 village onto the pass.They are all    
 quite{narrow}and{twisty}and apart from
 one short stretch in the village have 
{no footpaths.}Most are bordered by {  
{dry-stone walls}or{hedges.}Drivers    
 must look out for{sheep}which often   
 stray onto the road.                  
   There is{little traffic},although in
 summer coach-tours and holiday-makers 
 drive through.There is{no bus-service.</content>
