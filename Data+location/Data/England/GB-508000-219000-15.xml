		<title>15NOT SUCH HAPPY FAMILIES!</title>
		<content> I am worried about the number of      
 people in my school who have serious  
 family problems. Some parents seem to 
 argue all the time, sometimes so much 
 that families break up. When that     
 happens mums won't speak to dads and  
 sometimes they argue about who the    
 children are going to live with, and  
 families have to go to court to sort  
 everything out. I'm not going to let  
 this happen to me when I grow up.     
 Being able to buy all the things they 
 want doesn't seem to make families any
 happier nowadays and more and more    
 couples are being divorced. I wouldn't
 mind not having a colour television,  
 or a car, or the latest automatic     
 washing machine or a dishwasher if I  
 could just have a husband who loved me
 and our children. I have family       
 problems too.         {By Haley,age10
