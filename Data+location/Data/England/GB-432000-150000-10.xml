		<title>10FARMING IN HATHERDEN</title>
		<content> Richard Noyce is the manager of       
 Dunnings' Farm here in Hatherden.There
 are 2500 acres divided into fourteen  
 fields but only 200 acres are in      
 our block.In 1958 the land owned by   
 Dunnings was sold by the Capes family 
 and the present Dunnings Farm was     
 bought from some Americans. The       
 farmhouse Mr.Mrs Noyce live in was    
 built in 1729 because a beam has the  
 date engraved on it.This is the time  
 when George the Second was on the     
 throne.That part of the farm in our   
 area is mainly mixed between dairy    
 and cereal. There are 130 Fresian cows
 in the milking herd and this year     
 barley is their main crop.In the      
 milking shed the tank holds 750       
 gallons and in a typical day the      
 cows produce 3,000 litres of          
 milk.Twelve men work a five day week  
 on the farm and there are 12 tractors.</content>
