		<content> MANY ACTIVITIES ARE ENJOYED INVOLVING 
 CHURCHES, SCHOOLS, SPORTS CLUB AND    
{VILLAGE HALL}- SOME GROWING FROM THE  
 NEED TO RAISE MONEY. ORGANISATIONS    
 SUPPORT EACH OTHER AND PEOPLE BELONG  
 TO MORE THAN ONE, SO CONTRIBUTE       
 GREATLY TO VILLAGE LIFE. TWO SHOPS    
 PROVIDE MUCH OF THE DAILY REQUIREMENTS
 OF PEOPLE BUT THE{SUB-POST OFFICE}IS  
{VITAL}AS, WHILE MANY PEOPLE CAN DRIVE,
 ELDERLY PEOPLE AND YOUNG MOTHERS STILL
 NEED TO SHOP LOCALLY AND OBTAIN       
 PENSIONS AND CHILD ALLOWANCE IN CASH. 
 BOTH SHOPS ADVERTISE LOCAL FUNCTIONS, 
 ARTICLES WANTED OR FOR SALE AND LOCAL 
 JOBS AVAILABLE.{SHOPS IN A VILLAGE ARE
{A SOCIAL CENTRE,}AFFORDING AN EXCHANGE
 OF INFORMATION AND SEEING THAT NO-ONE 
 IS NEGLECTED. THIS ASPECT IS ALSO     
 COVERED BY THE CHURCHES AND OTHER     
 ORGANISATIONS.                        
                                       </content>
