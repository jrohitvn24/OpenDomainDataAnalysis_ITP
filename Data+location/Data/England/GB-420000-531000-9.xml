		<content> Life-styles in the small rural commun-
 ities that characterize this block are
 essentially simple. Newfield has some 
 150 houses, Binchester only 128; West-
 erton is much smaller. For successful 
 living, peole must enjoy a neighbourly
 form of self sufficiency. People here 
 must find most of their entertainment 
 &amp; hobbies around the doors.           
 Traditional pastimes include the cult-
 vation of allotments, often next to   
 the houses, &amp; here you may see pigeon 
 lofts or "crees". There is a Working  
 Mans Club at Newfield, a popular soc- 
 ial meeting place, where apart from   
 drink, bingo and "live" entertainment 
 can be found. At Binchester there is a
 Community Centre, used variously for  
 adult programmes eg. Old Tyme Dancing,
 but also the Youth Club-snooker,disco,
 and "jazz band".
