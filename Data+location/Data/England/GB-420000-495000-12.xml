		<content> There are no clubs as such in this    
 area but many residents are members of
 clubs in the proximity of their homes.
 For the very young there is a play    
 group, for older children there is    
 Brownies, Guides, Rangers, Cubs,      
 Scouts, Venture Scouts, a Youth Club, 
 St Johns Ambulance Cadets and a       
 Cricket Club, the Angling Association,
 the Karate Club and the local theatre 
 Company. For the older residents there
 is the Women's Institute, The Fifties 
 Club, and the Social Club. There are  
 several clubs associated with the     
 churches - The Sunday School, The     
 Mother's Union and the Handbell       
 Ringers. Most of these clubs are      
 classed as charitable organizations   
 and depend on support from the public.
