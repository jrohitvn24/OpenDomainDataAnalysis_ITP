		<title>05SHOPPING IN UCKFIELD.</title>
		<content>    Uckfield shops range along the{High
{Street}, a few spreading into{Church  
{Street and Framfield Road.}There is a 
 small local parade on the Manor Park  
 Estate.                               
    There is only one supermarket and  
 because of this many people travel to 
{Crowborough}and{Lewes}for their main  
 food shop,once a week.We do have a    
 selection of specialized food         
 businesses.                           
    We have a range of non food shops  
 but no department store so people     
 travel to{Eastbourne}and{Brighton}for 
 large items.We do have a good         
 selection of shoe retailers.          
    Most people feel that the bypass   
 will make Uckfield a nicer place to   
 shop.Our Thursday open market will be 
 replaced by a covered market soon and 
 more shops are planned in the near    
 future.                               </content>
