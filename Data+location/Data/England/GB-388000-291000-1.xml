		<content>{Sedgley}is{5 square}kilometres.The    
{Bullring}is the centre,although it is 
 not in the middle.Most of the houses  
 in{Sedgley}are to the{south-west side 
 of the Bullring.Some of the major     
 roads that pass through{Sedgley       
 are:The{A463}which is{Gospel End Road 
 and passes{east,Dudley Road which     
 passes south.The{A457}which is{Tipton 
{Road}and passes south.The{A459 which  
 is the{Wolverhampton Road}and passes  
 north and{Bilston Street}which passes 
 east.Sedgley could be a{town}because  
 we have a{Fine Fare,a school}and{major
{Banks,but}if it was a{proper town}it  
 would have a{Hospital,college,major   
{town hall,council offices,twenty four 
{hour police}and a{fire station,big    
{shops}and a{swimming}pool.I think     
{Sedgley}is a{town}because not all     
{towns}have{hospitals.Dudley}is the    
{nearest town}and is{south}and         </content>
