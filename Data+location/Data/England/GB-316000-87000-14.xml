		<title>14THE CHURCH IN BRANSCOMBE</title>
		<content> The church dates from Saxon times and 
 there is evidence of this in masonry  
 found at the base of the turret       
 staircase of the tower.The tower and  
 part of the nave are late Norman.In   
 the 13th century Walter Branscombe    
 added a North and South transcept.    
 Many more additions and alterations   
 were made,then in the 16th century    
 much damage and destruction took      
 place. Inside the church is a fine oak
 gallery given by a wealthy local      
 family. Before 1900 it had high pews  
 known as horsebox pews. These were    
 replaced with the pews existing today.
 The tower is Norman. It has a three   
 decker pulpit. On the outbreak of the 
 second world war 700 detailed pictures
 of it were taken as a precaution      
 against its destruction so that it is 
 probably the best documented  church  
 in England.                           </content>
