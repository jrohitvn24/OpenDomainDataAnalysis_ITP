		<title>02GEOLOGY OF BEDGEBURY AREA</title>
		<content>   This area is in the High Weald which
 is the hilly, wooded central core of  
 the Weald.                            
   The local rocks are the Hastings    
 Beds, a lacustrine deltaic deposit of 
 Early Cretaceous times (c. 120 million
 years ago), which has three major sub-
 divisions, i.e. Tunbridge Wells Sand  
 over Wadhurst Clay over Ashdown Sand. 
 The Sands are mainly very fine yellow 
 or whitish sand that in places is     
 cemented into sandstone rock.         
 Wadhurst Clay is usually a greyish    
 silty mudstone that weathers to a     
 yellow brown silty clay.              
   The outcrop of the sub-divisions is 
 highly variable due to faulting and   
 river erosion which has carved this   
 part of the country into its present  
 shape.  The south half of the block is
 mainly Tunbridge Wells Sand, the north
 roughly divided between sand and clay.</content>
