		<title>09EATING OUT IN NW. LONDON</title>
		<content> Nowadays a lot of people like to eat  
 out. A very popular place with        
 children is{McDonald's}where they sell
 hamburgers, chips, milkshakes, soft   
 drinks and sweet dishes.{Indian}      
 restaurants have become very popular  
 with adults.{Kentucky Fried Chicken}is
 also a favourite.{Chinese}restaurants 
 and take-aways are very well liked.   
{Take-aways}are always cheaper but     
 people like to eat out if they are    
 celebrating or if they have a visitor 
 or they simply want a change from home
 food. In the City's centre some       
 restaurants are very expensive and you
 have to be wearing a tie or you can't 
 go inside. There are also{Greek}      
 restaurants or{Turkish}ones and they  
 sell Kebabs which are delicious. In   
 some eating places you have to pay a  
 certain amount of money and then you  
 can eat as much as you can.-Juned&amp;Eric</content>
