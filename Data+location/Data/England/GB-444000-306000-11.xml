		<content> 5:30 He gets up and has his breakfast 
 and leaves home at 6:00.My shift      
 starts at 6:30 before I go down I have
 to change my clothes to put on my pit 
 clothes which include my              
 helmet,overalls,kneepads,belt,boots   
 and gloves.Then I have to collect my  
 tallies.I then proceed to the pit     
 shaft,before entering the cage to go  
 down I am searched for contraband     
 which is cigarettes,matches,cigarette 
 lighters which are not allowed down   
 the pit.The tally is an important     
 thing it lets people know who is down 
 the pit.The round tally is handed to  
 the onsetter for going down the pit.At
 the end of the shift the square tally 
 is handed in for coming back up.Once  
 down the pit we get on a train to go  
 to our district of work.We then go    
 back to the pit top.
