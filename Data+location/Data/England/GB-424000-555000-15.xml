		<content> Local History in Birtley is very      
 interesting. It had its origins back  
 in the llth Century but it did not    
 become important until the turn of the
 century as the trades of coal mines,  
 salt mines, brick yards and iron works
 expanded. In 1914 the area known as   
 Elisabethville was turned into a      
 Hospital and camp for the Belgian     
 refugees. The factory of Turney Wylde 
 on Elisabeth Avenue was also a hostel 
 and all the surrounding streets had   
 wooden huts housing the refugees.     
 After the first World War the hospital
 was converted into a school which was 
 demolished in 1982. Devon Autos       
 factory was formerly used as a soup   
 kitchen for local families during the 
 war years.                            
      Most of old Birtley is centred   
 around 'Charlie Perkins Monument' and 
 is now a conservation area.           </content>
