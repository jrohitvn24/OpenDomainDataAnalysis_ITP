		<content> In the Little Parndon area of the new 
 town much of the space is given over  
 to recreation, with a children's play 
 area (one of the very many in Harlow),
 two rugby pitches used by the local   
 amateur rugby teams and Canons Brook  
 Golf Course.                          
 The eighteen-hole course was leased to
 the Harlow and District Sports Trust  
 on a 99-years lease and now has 70    
 years to go. It was designed by Henry 
 Cotton and completed in 1964. An old  
 farm building on the site was         
 converted into the club house and the 
 course was officially opened in 1966. 
 About three-quarters of the 700 or so 
 members are Harlow residents, paying  
 initial membership fees of between    
 Â£200 and Â£300 for seven-day membership
