		<content>   In Gotham there are three main      
 industries other than farming.There is
 the South Nottinghamshire Bus         
 Company.British Gypsum mines gypsum,  
 which is taken by lorry to the East   
 Leake works where it is crushed into  
 powdered plaster and packed into      
 sacks. The plaster is transported by  
 lorry to all over Britain.Joywully    
 is a knitting factory,where jumpers,  
 cardigans and tracksuits are made.It  
 is very noisy in the knitting factory 
 with the clattering machines.We did a 
 survey to see how many children had   
 parents who worked at any of the above
 industries.
