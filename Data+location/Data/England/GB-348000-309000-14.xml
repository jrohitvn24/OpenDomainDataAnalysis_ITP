		<title>14QUARRYING AT SHARPSTONES</title>
		<content> Quarrying begins by drilling 16 holes 
 in the rock, inserting gelignite and  
 blasting. The{7OOO-1O,OOO}tons are    
 removed by dumper truck to crushers to
 reduce size of rock. Each dumper costs
{Â£45,OOO}and carries{45}tons. The tyres
 cost{Â£3,OOO}each. Various sizes of    
 stones are stored in piles ready for  
 selling, then are sent out on lorries.
 Special insulated lorries are used for
 tarmac loads to keep them warm. The   
 quarry is worked from Monday to Friday
 5a.m. to 8p.m., on Saturday from 6a.m.
 to midday and on Sunday from 7a.m. to 
 12 noon. The centre of the hill is    
 quarried to 33 metres above sea level 
 in three terraces. The type of stone  
 is grey whacky gritstone. It is very  
 hard and the best stone comes from the
 lower layers in the centre of the     
 hill. This sedimentary rock is pre-   
 Cambrian, the same as the{Longmynd.}  </content>
