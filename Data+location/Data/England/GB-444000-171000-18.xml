		<title>18FARM WORKERS</title>
		<content> An elderly partly retired farmworker  
 living in a rented cottage on his     
 employer's land sees the change from  
 labour intensive to machine intensive 
 as making life easier for the farmer. 
 Fork lift trucks dispense with the    
 need for a man to hump 2cwt sacks and 
 tractors replace the 6 or 8 horses    
 with 9 men still in use in the 1940's.
 Working days are shorter by at least 3
 hours and pay is an improvment on     
 Â£3.17.6 for a fortnight in the 1930's.
 During WORLD WAR II Italian prisoners 
 picked potatoes.Until recently there  
 was crop rotation and mixed farming.  
 This worker was very concerned at the 
 amount of sprays,artifical fertilizers
 used for high yields and feared for   
 the future of the soil as do many     
 scientists today.He enjoys managing   
 woods for pheasants and shoots rabbits
 to sell.                              </content>
