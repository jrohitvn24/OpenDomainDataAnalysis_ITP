		<content> Dudley Middle School conducted a job  
 survey amongst the parents.In this    
 area                                  
 here is a large chemical works but few
parents work there.The most popular    
type of job was in manufacturing.Near  
to us is a large food processing factor
y and a large number of parents,espec- 
ially mothers work there.Alot of fath- 
ers work in the building trade,others  
work for the local council.            
 Unemployment was one of the biggest   
categorys in our survey-there are not  
many jobs in our area for people out of
work.A lot of men used to work in the  
mining industry but the pit in our     
village was closed in 1977.Since then  
even more mines have closed so only a  
few fathers are miners.
