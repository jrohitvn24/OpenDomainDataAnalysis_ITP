		<content> MY BIG SISTER HAS A HORSE AND         
 OCCASIONALLY SHE LETS ME RIDE HIM. HE 
 IS KEPT ON A LOCAL FARM AND IN WINTER 
 WE FEED HIM ON PONY NUTS, VEGETABLES  
 AND BRAN, BUT IN SUMMER HE IS PUT OUT 
 TO GRASS. HIS NAME IS 'TIMMY' AND HE  
 IS GREY WITH LOTS OF BLACK SPOTS ALL  
 OVER. HE HAS A SHORT MANE AND LONG    
 TAIL. HE IS 13 HANDS AND IS AN        
 'APULUSSO'. HE IS 3 YEARS OLD AND I   
 LIKE RIDING HIM ESPECIALLY WHEN HE    
 CANTERS. SOMETIMES HE ROLLS IN THE    
 MUCK AND WE HAVE TO WASH HIM BUT WE   
 DON'T USE A HOSE PIPE BECAUSE IT      
 FRIGHTENS HIM. WHEN I GROOM HIM I USE 
 A DANDY BRUSH ON HIS BODY AND A CURRY 
 COMB FOR HIS MANE AND TAIL. I ALSO    
 CLEAN HIS HOOVES OUT WITH A HOOF PICK 
 AND PUT NEATS FOOT OIL ON THEM.       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
