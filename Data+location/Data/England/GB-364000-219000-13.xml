		<title>13IRON ORE</title>
		<content> The first excavations of Iron Ore in  
 the Wigpool area were made by the     
 Romans especially from 250 A.D. to 360
 A.D.was of the surface type Scowles   
 but they went down to a depth of over 
 250 ft.passing through layers of iron 
 ore bearing limestone and coal.They   
 iron ore was transported to the       
 largest iron-smelting site in Britain 
 at Ariconium via Hope Mansel.In later 
 times two Iron Pits were sunk.No.1.Pit
 was 530 feet deep whereas No.2.Pit was
 380 feet.This was the tip of a 12     
 Miles by 5 Miles bent small finger    
 like seam that was to produce over 1  
 Million tons of Iron ore.That is why  
 we have many isolated cottages in the 
 vicinity.They were the homes of iron  
 miners. From the Bailey side and      
 worked until 1921 when the roof       
 supporting a massive lake was broken  
 and the level in the wells above fell.</content>
