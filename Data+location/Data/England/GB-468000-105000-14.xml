		<content> Recently a motorbike was stolen, worth
 Â£800, from a home in Leigh Park in the
 early hours of Sunday morning.The     
 owner only had it insured for third   
 party fire &amp; theft, which means that  
 the owner could only claim money      
 against her loss if the motorbike was 
 not found.Recently the motorbike was  
 found by the Police in Warren Park.The
 motorbike had been stripped down to   
 the bare necessities, only the frame  
 of the bike and the two wheels        
 remained.                             
                                       
      THIS IS A TYPICAL CRIME OF HAVANT
