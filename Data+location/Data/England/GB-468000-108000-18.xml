		<title>18HAVANT THICKET-DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content> Havant Thicket,set on Horsefoot       
 Hill,is part of the ancient wood      
 called Forest of Bere,and is located  
 within the parish of Rowlands Castle. 
  The Forestry Commission owns and     
 looks after the woodland for outdoor  
 recreation for local people.It is next
 to a busy main road,but when you enter
 the wood it feels as though you are   
 entering another world.               
  The area we visited is mostly        
 deciduous ,but around the centre are  
 some yew and pine.The pond area in the
 north-west was damaged by fire in     
 1976,but about ten years later the    
 damaged part still has not recovered, 
 and the burnt patch is quite large.   
   To help people enjoy experiencing   
 the woodland of Havant                
 Thicket,St.John'First &amp; Middle School 
 has set up a nature trail which we    
 followed.by Louise Farres and A.West. </content>
