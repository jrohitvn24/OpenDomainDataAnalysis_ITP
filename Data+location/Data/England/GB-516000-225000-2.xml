		<content> Not surprisingly most of the houses   
 in this{rural area}are{detached,}with 
 the exception of the relatively       
{densely populated villages of Gosmore 
{and St.Ippolyts,}and the odd terrace  
{of}cottages.Gosmore has roughly forty 
 houses,St.Ippolyts about sixty.Most of
 these are{owner-occupied}although     
 renting is not altogether uncommon.In 
 between these two areas lies a        
{comparatively large council housing   
 estate of some 250 houses which is    
 often referred to as both St.Ippolyts 
 and Gosmore.                          
 Immediately north of Gosmore leading  
 into Hitchin lie a{further 200 or so  
{detached houses.}These are very       
 sizeable and upmarket properties often
 with very spectacular gardens.Finally 
{a few houses}fall into our block on   
 the{northern outskirts of Preston     
 which are once again fairly desirable </content>
