 Our block lies at the foot of the     
 Cotswold Hills which are to the South-
 East.It is overlooked from the West by
 Robinswood Hill which is 198m in      
 height.The city of Gloucester lies    
 three miles to the North.The M5 motor-
 way divides the block diagonally from 
 the North-East to the South-West.The  
 centre of the block is dominated by   
 the village of Upton St Leonards.To   
 the North-West of the village is a    
 large, sprawling mixed residential    
 area of council and private housing   
 soon to be greatly increased.The      
 remainder of the block to the East and
 South is covered by farm land.To the  
 South-East of the block is Prinknash  
 Abbey which lies on the escarpment of 
 the Cotswold Hills.                   </content>
