		<title>17   WAVERLEY ABBEY</title>
		<content> Tha Abbey was founded in 1128 by Abbot
 John and 12 monks from Aumone,near    
 Chartres,on land near the River Wey   
 given by the Bishop of Winchester.    
 Waverley was the first Cistercian     
 monastery in England and it became the
 largest and most influential house of 
 the Order.The White monks used to walk
 into the town by Abbey Street_today   
 this is a cul-de-sac.  In 1536 the    
 Abbey's life was suppressed with the  
 dissolution of monasteries and the    
 buildings fell into disrepair.The     
 stone of Waverley became a convenient 
 source of building material in the    
 area.                                 
 Excavations were carried out at the   
 turn of the century and in recent     
 years the Abbey has been administered 
 by The Department of Environment. The 
 site was closed to the public for     
 about 20 years while preservation work</content>
