		<content> The Whitehaven News is read by about  
 70,000 people every week.The public   
 buy it because of the good balance    
 between features and news.The paper   
 started 133 years ago.It covers an    
 area of West Cumbria from Seascale to 
 Distington.The paper draws the        
 attention of the public to cases of   
 abuse and injustice.The reporters also
 cover items of local interest such as 
 carnivals, employment,sport etc.Local 
 secretaries send in reports about such
 things as hound-trailing,darts matches
 etc.Nowadays the printing is set up by
 computer.The paper is financed through
 advertising,ranging from property     
 sales to lost&amp;found.It relies mostly  
 on adverts from local garages and     
 Estate Agents.The Editor decides what 
 is published and tries to give an     
 impartial viewpoint.
