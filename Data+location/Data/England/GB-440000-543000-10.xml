		<content> On Easinton village green there is    
 amilestone and it says Houghton Le    
 Spring 7 miles. Near the milestone are
 two sycamore trees. They were put     
 there in 1897 because Queen Victoria  
 was Queen for 60 years and had her    
 diamond jubilee. There is a flat      
 stone, some say it is an old well and 
 some say it is there for people to get
 on their horses. At the top near the  
 church is the form seat. It was made  
 by John and Andrew Delanoy's great    
 great grandad in 1897. There are 3    
 shops on the village green and 5 pubs.
 The shops are a newsagent a butcher   
 and a fish and chip shop. The pubs are
 the Masons Arms, The Kings Head, The  
 Shoulder of Mutton, The Village Inn   
 and Southside Social Club. A new bus  
 shelter has been built after pressure 
 from the parish council.
