		<title>16Harrock Hall near Parbold</title>
		<content>The original Hall was built in the 15th
Century,the Elizabethan period. The    
Rigbye family owned it for centuries,  
but during the last 50 years there have
been 13 owners.7 years ago it was      
almost derelict but now it is rebuilt, 
looking very impressive.There are 14   
rooms in the main building,and 5 rooms 
in a nearby "cottage" which is to be   
used as a tied-cottage.The Hall is     
occupied by the farm manager who runs  
the 210 acre farm.There is a 5 bay     
Dutch barn,cowsheds,box stalls,bull    
pens,a straw yard,milking parlour,calf 
pens and a barn for silage.Cattle are  
sold alternate years at the farm.People
from Canada and America stay at the    
Hall when they come to look at the     
Holstein cattle.
