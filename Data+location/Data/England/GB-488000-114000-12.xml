		<title>12FEATURES OF S.DOWNS</title>
		<content>    The view from the top of the Downs 
 is restricted by trees, particularly  
 on the S.side where there used to be a
 clear view of the Trundle at Goodwood 
 &amp; of the sea at Chichester harbour.   
 Northward, there are still wide views 
 over Graffham, Ambersham, Heyshott &amp;  
 to Blackdown hill at Haslemere.       
    There are only three dwellings in  
 this block: Broadham House, nr.Single-
 ton (sq.9), Newhouse Farm &amp; Pheasant  
 House nr. E.Dean (sq.11).             
    Most farmland is divided by post &amp; 
 wire fences but a few fields have     
 traditional hedges. Gates are of metal
 or wood. Wooden fences divide the     
 forests on the S.edge of the downs    
 with stiles for access to paths which 
 are finger posted on the top of the   
 downs but not in the forest where over
 grown paths are hard to follow. The   
 S.Downs Way is clearly finger posted. </content>
