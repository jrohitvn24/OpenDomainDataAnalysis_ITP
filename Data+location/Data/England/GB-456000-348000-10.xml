		<title>10TIFFANY'S SUNDAY</title>
		<content> On Sunday I go to church at 9.45 and  
 go into Sunday school,and learn things
 about God.At 10.50 we go into church  
 and get blessed.When we get back home 
 we can smell the lovely aroma of roast
 chicken,and potatos.At 12.30 we all   
 sit down and eat our{scrumptious      
{lunch,}we finish it off with ice cream
 and apple pie.In the afternoon we go  
 down to the woods with our dog.Then   
 after that we go on a bike ride down  
 Arnold, and look at all the windows of
 the{clothes}shops.We go to a{sweet    
 shop and get something to eat,we go   
 and eat our grub in our favourite     
 place.When we get home we watch a{T.V 
 program called'Murder she wrote.'     
 After that we go up to our rooms and  
 sort out our school clothes.Then we go
 to bed.
