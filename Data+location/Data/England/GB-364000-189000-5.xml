		<title>05OLD COTTAGES</title>
		<content> Around our area are many old, stone   
 built cottages, many of them extended 
 and modernised over the years. Each of
 them is very individual and set in a  
 large private garden. Many of them    
 have open fires and no central        
 heating. Most of them have thick      
 walls, small windows and small rooms. 
 The occupants tell us they are        
 difficult to heat and expensive to    
 maintain and repair. However, in spite
 of all this, people are very proud to 
 own them and enjoy their              
 individuality. They are expensive to  
 buy because people prefer living in   
 the country but with easy access to   
 the amenities of the town.
