		<title>10Buses in Melchbourne</title>
		<content> The United Counties buses do not go to
 Melchbourne; to catch a public bus    
 residents have to walk about 1.5 miles
 to Dean Entrance. This is an          
 infrequent service to Bedford and St  
 Neots.                                
 There is a coach which takes people to
 Rushden on Wednesdays and Fridays.    
 This only costs 10p for pensioners if 
 they have a pensioners bus pass as it 
 is subsidised by the County Council.  
 The fare for every one else is 60p.   
 The children in the village that go to
 school in Risely and Sharnbrook have a
 special coach. This can only be used  
 by school children.                   
 Most people in Melchbourne have a car 
 and the households where the husband  
 works out of the village have two     
 cars.
