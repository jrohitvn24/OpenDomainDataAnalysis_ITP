		<title>06Royal Observer Corp Post</title>
		<content> line to two other posts,one at        
 Brighton and the other at Cuckfield.  
 Cuckfield is the radio post for the   
 three.                                
  The Royal Observer Corp is the major 
 part of 'The United Kingdom Warning   
 and Monitoring Organisation'.The men  
 who man the post have to do a number  
 of tasks. They have to monitor and    
 report nuclear bursts and radio active
 fallout and give warning of an air    
 attack or fallout by siren or by      
 firing a maroon.If a nuclear attack   
 has occurred the men have to carry out
 mobile monitoring,providing general   
 intelligence of local conditions.     
  The full establishment of the cluster
 of three posts would be a head        
 observer in charge,a leading observer 
 acting as deputy and post instructor  
 and eight observers.In peace time     
 these men do ordinary jobs.           </content>
