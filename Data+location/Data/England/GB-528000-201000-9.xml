		<content> On Friday before half term we went in 
 a small group to the caravan site down
 Vineyard's Road.When we got there we  
 went in a house called High Willows.  
 The caravan site was 25years old and  
 covers 1\acres.It is owned by         
 Mrs.Braun who has lived at the house  
 for 10years.Over all the house,site   
 and grounds cover 5acres.Travellers   
 from as far away as New Zealand have  
 stayed at the site.The maximum stay is
 28days and the site can take, at the  
 most 5 caravans. The site is PRIVATE  
 and you have to book into it through  
 The Caravan Club. High Willows was    
 built in 1860 and converted in 1951 as
 it was in a bad condition.Vineyard's  
 Rd. was so named because grapevines   
 were grown here, way back in history. 
 We have discovered that 500 vines grow
 here today on land owned by Nyn Manor 
 Farm!                                 </content>
