		<title>10Blackmore Priory Church</title>
		<content> The Domesday name for this area  is   
 Fingrith Manor but "Blackmore" comes  
 from the supposed blackish soil       
 around.As far as{religion}was         
 concerned the Priory,owned by the     
 Augustinian Priors,was founded by the 
 de Sandford family and dedicated to   
 St.Lawrence.During the{Black Death }  
 Plague about 300 tenants died.During  
 the Dissolution of the Monastries by  
 Henry V111,John Smyth dimolished half 
 of the Priory until villagers stopped 
 him.A 13th century{cresset stone}was  
 found and is now on display within the
{church}.The timber{tower}was built in 
 1475 and is the most impressive in    
 England.It's built in three stages    
 with impressive struts,beams and      
 arched braces standing upon a 30ft.   
 base.The largest of five{bells}weighs 
 \ a ton and 3 were cast by Miles Grey 
 famous for his tenor bells.{          </content>
