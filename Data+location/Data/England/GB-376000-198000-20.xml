		<title>20Population.</title>
		<content> Our block is quite thinly populated   
 compared to a town or city block.     
 The biggest village is Uley,which has 
 1500 people in 1985. This population  
 is currently falling.                 
 About 100 years ago a lot of people   
 lived in the area,because of the work 
 generated by the booming woollen      
 industry. When it collapsed many      
 people left the area to find work in  
 the towns and cities. The population  
 has steadily declined since then.     
 Uley is a middle class village,with   
 many people in the "professions".     
 Houses are very expensive and young   
 people usually cannot afford to buy   
 them.Therefore the average age in the 
 village is getting older all the time.
 Young families mainly live in council 
 housing. The Parish Council is        
 pressing for housing for young people 
 in the area to prevent this decline.  </content>
