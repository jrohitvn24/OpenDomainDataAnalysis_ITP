		<title>13A Riding Stable-Dorking NE</title>
		<content>  These stables were a bit like a      
 farmyard.The partitions for the       
 stables were crooked,the ground was   
{muddy}and there was hay and straw     
 everywhere.{                          
  They have{13 horses,}2 dogs (Jack    
 Russells) and they used to have 4     
 goats and a foal.                     
  They ride on{Headley Heath}and they  
 breed their own horses. Mr.Warrick    
 employs 2 stable workers at the moment
 but he usually has 8 stable workers.  
 The stables are cleaned out daily.    
  He{feeds}his horses on chaff,sugar   
 beet,nuts and molasses and he gets his
 food locally.                         
  The people who book rides mainly come
 from{London.}They teach clubs,schools 
 and individuals.                      
  They used to have some special tack  
 for{handicapped}riders.
