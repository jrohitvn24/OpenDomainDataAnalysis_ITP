		<title>12The village of Cuckney.</title>
		<content> Cuckney is larger than Norton and the 
 busy A60 and A616 roads form a        
 crossroads there .Most of the housing 
 is along the quieter A616.Nearly all  
 of the properties in the village are  
 rented from the Welbeck Estate and    
 many housed workers in the village's 3
 cotton mills in the 18th century.     
  The primary school in the village is 
 the result of the conversion of one of
 these mills by the Duke of Portland in
 1848.                                 
  The village has its own cricket field
 with teams playing in the local       
 leagues,before retiring to the popular
 Greendale Oak pub.The pub does a      
 thriving lunchtime and evening meal   
 trade. Close to the pub are the church
 and the church hall.The hall is a     
 focal point of village life ,being    
 used among other things to house a    
 Tuesday lunch provided for pensioners.</content>
