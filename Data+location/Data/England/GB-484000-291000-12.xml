Life in the villages has remained the  
same for centuries with people living  
and working in the same family jobs.   
Today,because of problems with         
employment the present generation are  
having to move out of the area. This   
has caused a change in village life    
over the last twenty years as many     
house have been bought up by           
"outsiders". This has caused a gap in  
some cases between the older           
inhabitants and the new ,often         
wealthier arrivals.
