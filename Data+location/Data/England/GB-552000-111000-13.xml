 The main source of local employment is
farming which could also be classified 
as the area's main industry.           
 I suspect that the rate of            
unemployment is as high here as        
anywhere else.The majority of people   
living in this area are employed in    
Eastbourne, Brighton, Lewes and        
in London. Some sources of employment  
as advertised in the local paper       
are:-Dental surgeon's assistant        
wanted; bar staff required for         
nightclub and paper boys and girls     
wanted; receptionist wanted for busy   
dental surgery.                        
 Many of the local people are self     
employed working as sellers of home    
produced fruits and vegetables up to   
running their own farms.
