		<title>16THE NEW ESTATES.</title>
		<content>  Nicholson Park is an example of one  
 of the estates built in the 1960's. It
 lies in Grands Vaux Valley below a    
 large reservoir.                      
  With the big rise in the population  
 (mainly due to immigration from the   
 mainland) large waiting lists for     
 properties grew. The States of Jersey 
 decided to build a number of housing  
 estates for both owner occupier and   
 rental. From the mid sixties to early 
 seventies areas of the least          
 productive land were selected for     
 these estates.                        
  A typical example of one of these is 
 Maufant Village which lies near the   
 northern border of the block.         
  Housing on a small Island like Jersey
 will always be a problem as space is a
 very precious resource; these new     
 estates have only gone part way to    
 solving it.                           </content>
