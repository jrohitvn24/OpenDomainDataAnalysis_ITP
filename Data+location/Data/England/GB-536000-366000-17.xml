		<title>17The Hundleby Hotel.</title>
		<content>     The Hundleby Hotel was built at   
 sometime in the l9th century. It      
 started life as an inn called The     
 Maltster Arms. Outside the inn there  
 was a cobbled court yard with stables 
 and coach houses. These have now been 
 demolished and three houses stand in  
 their place.                          
     In l872 and for several years     
 after there was a yearly feast at the 
 Maltster Arms. There was home made    
 amusements such as egg racing, dog and
 rabbit racing.                        
     It is reported that there used to 
 be several tramps who would sit on the
 step shouting out for drink but unable
 to pay. In the end, the landlord      
 always took a pint of beer out to them
 to keep them quiet.                   
     The Hundleby now has 8 rooms to   
 let and a staff of 4 people.
