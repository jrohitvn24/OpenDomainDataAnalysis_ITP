		<title>04Edlington Wood History</title>
		<content>    Edlington wood has an interesting  
{Historical background}.There is       
 evidence of a{Roman settlement}dating 
 back to at least the late 2nd or 3rd  
 century A.D.                          
  At the time of the Domesday survey   
 1680 acres of{pasturable woodland     
{covered the}Edlington Manor.          
  Yet in medieval times the area of    
 woodland was as small as{80 acres.}   
  In 1700 the Manor was purchased by   
{Robert Molesworth who replanted the   
{wood}as an estate, resulting in about 
 300 acres of woodland with ride-ways  
 radiating from a central point.This   
 point still being marked by a         
 classical greyhound monument. However,
 during the late 1970's{tree felling   
{removed about 90 acres.}This has been 
 replaced with arable farmland in the  
 middle of the wood.{(Not shown on
