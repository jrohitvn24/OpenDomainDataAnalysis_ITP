             We want to compare a large
and a small food chain store, so we    
interviewed the manager and ten        
shoppers at both shops.                
             We found that in the small
food shop that Saturday was busiest.   
There were 14,000 customers per week.  
They change the products according to  
demand.There are 24 assistants.At this 
convenient shop,40% of the customers go
daily,60% buy branded goods.
