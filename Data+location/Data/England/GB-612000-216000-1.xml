 The twelve grid squares studied in    
 this project are in an area around St.
 Osyth strething to the edge of the    
 sea-side resort of Clacton-on-Sea.    
 There is little housing and very few  
 shops most of which are located in    
 sections of housing estates on the    
 fringes of the allocated area.        
 There are two caravan parks, one      
 called 'Meadow View',the other called 
 'Shangri-La'.The remainder of this    
 area consists of woodland and arable  
 farms.                                
 A church and small cemetry as well as 
 several large farm houses and halls   
 are the main historical buildings of  
 interest.
