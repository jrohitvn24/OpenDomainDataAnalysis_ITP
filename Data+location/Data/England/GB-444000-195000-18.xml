  Marcham Mill is mentioned in Domesday
Book, but Mrs Jones who lives there    
told us there was a Saxon mill called  
{Wulfmere's Mill}. Wulf was a pike.    
Later the mill was called {Wergen      
Mill}, wergen means willow.            
   The mill used to grind corn. It     
stopped about 1900.                    
   The spring at the mill is salty even
though the mill is 60 miles from the   
sea. The people who lived there        
had to get their water from the        
village. A lot of the flowers are      
saltwater ones. One of them is wild    
celery. The name Marcham means the     
"riverside where the wild celery grows"
