		<title>19Mining, A Future Callington?</title>
		<content>{  Mining}is a vastly expensive        
 enterprise. Even the prospecting stage
 involves cost running into millions of
 pounds.                               
   If a prospect is found to be viable,
 mining companies the look for         
 investment from investors. In the case
 of the mining operation in{Callington,
 thirty million pounds would be needed,
 a lot to ask in a time of recession.  
   Mr. Gerald Pengilly feels that is   
 investors could be found for the      
 enterprise, Callingon could become a  
 boom town, with jobs and wealth in    
 pleanty. And Cornwall could become a  
 pre-eminent mineral mining erea again.
   In Callingon and its environs lodes 
 of{tin, copper, arsenic, wolfram,     
{tungsten, manganese and iron}exist,   
 but in what degree and how economical 
 it will be to extract is the question?
