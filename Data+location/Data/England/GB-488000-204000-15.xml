 parishes. An elected Parochial Church 
 Council &amp; 2 Churchwardens conduct the

 Holy Communion, &amp; Morning Prayer or   
 Parish Communion. A thriving young    
 church, led by lay people, meets in   
 the Old Church. The{Methodist Church} 
 in Lee Common has a service at 3pm    
 each Sunday taken by the minister from
 Chesham or a lay preacher.{Free Church
 - Emmanuel Hall, Swan Bottom, has a   
 service at 6pm on Sundays taken by the
 lay people. The members of the        
 congregation organise the services.   
 The{Baptist Chapel}has been converted 
 to a residential building &amp; there is  
 no {Roman Catholic}church in The Lee, 
 so Baptists go to Chesham &amp; Catholics
