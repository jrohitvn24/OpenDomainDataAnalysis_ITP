 open space in the centre of{TELFORD.}A
 large part of the park is now land-   
 scaped but until the early 1970's it  
 was derelict industrial land.The lakes
 are not natural and the mounds are    
 mining spoil heaps about 100 years old
  Woodland has developed on these old  
 sites and they now form a valuable    
{WILDLIFE HABITAT}and a major part of  
 the landscape.The part of the park    
 which is nearest the{TOWN CENTRE      
 contains the formal{CHELSEA GARDENS,}a
 childrens play area, a band stand and 
 the arena which is used for such      
 annual events as Super Saturday and   
 the Telford Games.Beside Randlay Lake 
 is the open air amphitheatre.         
 Wonderland is also here complete with 
 Nursery rhyme and Fairy Tale houses.
