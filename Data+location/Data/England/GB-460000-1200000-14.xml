		<title>14Uyeasound Sheltered Houses.</title>
		<content> Ten of the houses at Brucehall Terrace
 are Sheltered Houses with 13 people   
 living in them.The houses were built  
 in 1977.They have a bedroom,a kitchen,
 a bathroom,a living room and a store  
 room and an attic.                    
   The people who live there think they
 are easier and cheaper to keep clean  
 and warm.Most of them like living     
 there.However two of them don't like  
 living there because there is a poor  
 view.They all like the neighbours.    
   The houses have a warden who lives  
 in Brucehall Terrace.Her job consists 
 of calling the Doctor when necessary  
 or contacting Lerwick for repairs to  
 the house.There is an alarm system for
 the old people to use.The warden also 
 calls socially to keep in touch and   
 help with minor house jobs such as    
 changing light bulbs or fuses.Some of 
 the residents have a Home Help.       </content>
