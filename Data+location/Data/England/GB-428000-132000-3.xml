		<title>03ECOLOGY: Broughton Down</title>
		<content> On the{downs}there are many different 
 kinds of{trees.}The most common are   
 beech, yew, oak and ash. There is     
 hawthorn scrub growing on the slopes  
 of the downs. Flowering{plants}include
 violets, cowslips and orchids. There  
 are interesting types of{fungi}living 
 on dead trees. Many signs of wild {   
{animals}can be seen; rabbits and deer 
 have chewed the bark of trees, there  
 are holes where foxes, rabbits and    
 badgers live and there are ant-hills  
 everywhere. There are vast numbers of 
{butterflies}up on Broughton Downs     
 and some of them are very unusual. If 
 you stand still for a while some of   
 the butterflies  rest on the banks;   
 mostly you see tortoiseshell{         
 butterflies  and large white, but     
 sometimes you see brimstone, chalkhill
 blue, meadow brown, comma and lots    
 more as well.                         </content>
