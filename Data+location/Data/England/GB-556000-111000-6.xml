		<title>06Transport in the Eighties.</title>
		<content> Transport has changed an awful lot    
 since the Doomsday book was           
 published. There are many types of    
 cars, and the car market is very big  
 nowadays.  Cars are basically         
 the same, they all have either a      
 internal combustion engine, or a fuel 
 injected engine, though, a few do     
 have diesel engines. Aeroplanes on the
 other hand are not such a big market  
 but lots more money is involved. The  
 aeroplane has two main types of       
 engine, the propellor and the jet.    
 Most aeroplanes are made of steel but 
 gliders are made of fibre glass. Boats
 are very fast, light and agile. Most  
 boats use a propellor to propel them. 
 But some use other methods. Like the  
 aeroplanes, large liners are made of  
 steel and small boats are made of     
 fibre glass. Overall transport now    
 uses much modern technology.          </content>
