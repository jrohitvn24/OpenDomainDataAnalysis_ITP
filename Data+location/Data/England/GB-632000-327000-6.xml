		<title>06HONING BLACKSMITH SHOP</title>
		<content> Mr. Alden is an engineer employed by a
 large road trailer manufacturing      
 concern in   the local market town of 
 North Walsham. In his spare time he   
 works in the old blacksmith's shop in 
 the village. He would like this to    
 become his full time occupation.      
 Currently he makes ornamental garden  
 pieces in the main. He demonstrated   
 how to make a piece of metal into a   
 spiral shape. He heated the metal in  
 the forge and used pliers to bend and 
 twist the hot metal. Later he beat a  
 blunt metal bar into a point on his   
 anvil. The forge once serviced the    
 local estate and busily repaired      
 agricultural machinery, and shod      
 horses. The original hand bellows     
 still survive in the shop, but Mr.    
 Alden uses an electrically driven     
 motor to create draught for the       
 forge. He gave us an easter egg each. </content>
