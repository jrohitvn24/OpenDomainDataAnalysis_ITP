		<content> The{A63T}- the main Hull-Leeds road - 
 bisects the village of Thorpe         
 Willoughby.  There is much traffic,   
 especially H.G.V.'s.  The amount of   
 traffic and the speed at which the    
 vehicles travel pose many problems for
 residents.  There is an accident      
 'black spot' where a minor road joins 
 the A63.  Residents also feel that    
 lighting is poor on the main road     
 which adds to the problem. Delays also
 occur at the level crossings in Thorpe
 Willoughby.                           
                                       
 A proposed{by-pass}for Selby could    
 alleviate some problems on the A63.   
 One of the routes, which starts close 
 to Thorpe Gates and goes to the South 
 of Selby, would reduce traffice from  
 the estimated figure of 6900 vehicles 
 per day in l991 to 4600 vehicles.
