		<title>01IMPRESSIONS OF THE AREA</title>
		<content> This area has 2 or 3 little           
 communities, a lot of woodland, and a 
 lot of open countryside which is      
 farmed.   Most of the people we spoke 
 to were very friendly and helpful, but
 there were some who were very rude and
 did not help us at all.   We noticed  
 that every house seemed to have a dog.
 The land is mostly split up into two  
 big estates - one has 2500 acres and  
 another 1000 - and big farms.   There 
 is a PGL adventure centre for children
 down at Hole-in-the-Wall by the river,
 which is perfect along this stretch   
 for canoing and fishing.   The PGL    
 base is where there used to be a toll 
 gate and a pub for the bargees when   
 there was barge traffic on the Wye.   
 It is really peaceful and beautiful   
 along this bit of river, but only the 
 PGL children ever visit it.  That     
 seems a pity.                         </content>
