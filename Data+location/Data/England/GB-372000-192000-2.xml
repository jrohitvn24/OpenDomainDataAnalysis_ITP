		<title>02A TYPICAL FAMILY SATURDAY</title>
		<content> ON SATURDAY MY DAD WAKES ME UP AND I  
 GO DOWNSTAIRS FOR BREAKFAST. I USUALLY
 HAVE CEREAL AND A CUP OF COFFEE. AFTER
 WARDS I GET WASHED AND DRESSED AND    
 FEED MY GERBIL. NEXT I FIND MY VIOLIN 
 AND MUSIC AND GO OUT TO THE CAR.      
 HELEN, MY NEIGHBOUR, JOINS MY BROTHER 
 JAMES AND ME AND WE ARE DRIVEN TO     
 NAILSWORTH WHERE I PLAY IN THE SOUTH  
 GLOS. SCHOOLS' ORCHESTRA. I AM IN THE 
 SECOND VIOLINS. AFTER PLAYING FOR TWO 
 AND A HALF HOURS I MEET HELEN AND     
 JAMES WHO HAVE BEEN PLAYING FLUTE AND 
 RECORDER AND WE GO HOME FOR LUNCH. IN 
 THE AFTERNOON I GO TO WOTTON POOL FOR 
 SWIMMING, OR PLAY IN THE BACK GARDEN. 
 IN THE EVENING I WATCH TELEVISION.
