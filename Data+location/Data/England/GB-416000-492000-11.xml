		<content>   Eight farmers  keep{sheep}as well as
 cattle.  Favoured breeds  are Scottish
 Blackface crossed with Teeswater, half
 bred Masham  and  Suffolk. Mainly they
 are bred for fat lambs. Some wool goes
 to Halifax mills.  A few Jacob's sheep
 are kept.{Spring and winter barley}for
 animal feed is grown on 3 farms, roots
 on another.  At Ayrlow Banks they grow
{wheat and oilseed rape.}Scrogg Farm is
 entirely arable. Artichokes are one of
 the crops grown  to attract gamebirds.
 Constable Burton Hall guests  shoot on
 the land. Cote House rears turkeys for
 Christmas markets.  We discovered only
 one pig  and a small number of poultry
 for farmers own use. During our{Y.O.C.
 walks   along country lanes   or newly
 signposted{footpaths }over the fields,
 we see plenty  of wild life. Roe deer,
 kingfishers, wayside flowers  or foxes
 are favourites here.Our{elms are dead.</content>
