		<title>18MADELEY POOL</title>
		<content>                                       
  The pool in the centre of the village
was constructed in the middle of the   
eighteenth century to turn the mill    
wheel. It is fed from the River Lea, a 
small  river that meanders along close 
to the road. During the last two years,
it has been suggested that the pool    
should be filled in, because of the    
increased cost of dredging. Public     
opinion was so strong that even though 
the pool has a tendency to silt up     
quickly, it was decided to retain this 
centrepiece of the village. Now fisher-
men spend many happy hours by its banks
and swans, moorhens and coots enjoy its
calm waters. A small island provides a 
breeding ground for the birds.         
  The mill has been a corn mill, a     
cheese mill, and,later, a warehouse for
nylon material. It is now derelict and 
unsafe and is shortly to be demolished.</content>
