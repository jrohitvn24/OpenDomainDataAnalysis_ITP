		<content> In the 1960s and 1970s, farmers could 
 control weed growth by spraying with  
 chemicals which attacked broad-leaved 
 plants but left grasses and cereals   
 unharmed.  However, the plants killed 
 were indigenous varieties in danger of
 being lost for ever.  Also threatened 
 were the animals, birds and insects   
 whose lives depended on them.         
                                       
 Public disapproval led to the         
 formation of the Worcestershire Nature
 Conservation Trust, dedicated to      
 acquiring land and conserving its     
 natural growth.  In 1979 it bought the
 3/4 acre Drake Street Meadow Reserve, 
 grid ref. 802398, where grow 75       
 species of lowland meadow flowers and 
 ferns including green winged orchid,  
 adders tongue fern, burnet and pepper 
 saxifrage, cowslip, bluebell, wood    
 violet, and dogs mercury.             </content>
