 Pitsford Hill isn't much of a place,  
 you could almost drive through it     
 without knowing it was there. It is   
 situated at the top of a steep hill   
 and there are several junctions just  
 before and just after you go through  
 the hamlet.                           
                                       
 The hamlet is about 130' above sea    
 level. There are a few white-walled   
 cottages with slate roofs and a small 
 general store / post office. We went  
 in to ask the man about the shop and  
 to tell him about the survey. He said 
 that the shop isn't very busy in the  
 winter but in July and August a       
 surprising number of people pass      
 through the village on their way to   
 the north coast.                      
                                       
                                       </content>
