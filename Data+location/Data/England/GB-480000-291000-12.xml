		<content> The part of Medbourne included in this
 block has a majority of old stone     
 houses and cottages mostly owner      
 occupied. The few modern houses and   
 bungalows have been blended into the  
 overall scene due to the strict       
 control of planning regulations in    
 this conservation area. There are     
 twenty eight council houses and a few 
 of these have been purchased by their 
 tenants.                              
 Drayton is a mixture of old and new,  
 again mostly owner occupied. There are
 sixteen council houses.               
 Nevill Holt consists of only seven    
 houses all owned by the Phillips      
 Family, owners of the school, and     
 occupied by their employees.          
 There are a number of outlying farms  
 and cottages but new building is      
 restricted to infilling in the        
 villages except for agricultural needs</content>
