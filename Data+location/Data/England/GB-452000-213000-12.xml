		<content>The celebration of May Day is the      
strongest surviving custom and is      
centred in Islip.The celebration is    
based on the school and                
can be traced back over a hundred      
years.It began by children absenting   
themselves from school,presumably      
backed by their parents,and taking a   
holiday.Over the years the event       
became more formalised.A garland was   
carried round the village by the       
children.A May Queen was elected from  
among the school children,and there    
was dancing round the Maypole and      
refreshments.In 1985 Emily Beane,aged  
10,was crowned on May 1st in the       
school grounds before a large gathering
from the village.The garland is no     
longer carried because of the traffic  
but there was the customary dancing    
followed by tea in the school          
hall.Emily was the 61st Queen in line. </content>
