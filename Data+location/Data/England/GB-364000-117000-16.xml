		<title>16Methodist Church</title>
		<content> The{Methodist Church}in Milborne Port 
 is a large Victorian building erected 
 in 1866 and capable of seating 350    
 people.Sunday worship takes place both
 morning and evening but congrgations  
 are small,on average 30 adults and 20 
 children in the morning,and 12 adults 
 in the evening.Most of those attending
 are pensioners,and the financial      
 burdens of the quarterly payments to  
 the Circuit,and of maintaining        
 buildings are increasingly difficult  
 to bear.At the same time,close        
 relationships with other denominations
 in the area,together with the         
 financial problems,make it probable   
 that an amalgamation of two or more of
 the denominations will take place in  
 the future.Monthly United services    
 where many denominations take part are
 well supported.
