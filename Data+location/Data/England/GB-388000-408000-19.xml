		<content>      More women than men said that    
 there were problems when the motorway 
 was built. The noise and lights at    
 night led to a protest which          
 restricted work from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. 
      Of the twelve who answered the   
 questions, 3 liked it there, while the
 rest were ambivalent or did not like  
 it.                                   
      Traffic noise was mentioned by 9 
 residents. After 14 years they do not 
 seem to be getting used to it. One    
 also complained of the smoke.         
      They did not have many problems  
 with their own children, but all seem 
 to warn other children of the dangers 
 of playing near the motorway.         
      Six people do not have pets; the 
 others keep their animals away from   
 the road or train them well.
