		<title>16PRIMARY SCHOOL; PLUMSTEAD</title>
		<content>Bannockburn School is a nice quiet     
school. We learn to play instruments   
like guitars,trumpets and recorders.   
And we work very hard every day. We do 
Maths, Handwriting and English. We have
to read or we'll be in trouble with my 
teacher. Most children really like     
doing art work and doing a nice project
on something. We sometimes even go out 
for an outing to museums, seasides and 
good places like that. When we leave   
the school and go to our secondary     
school they give us something to       
remember the old school like a book.
