		<title>08HAND MADE INSTRUMENTS</title>
		<content>Brian Carlick makes musical instuments 
by hand.He lives in Charlton-on-Otmoor.
The thing he makes most of is the three
holed pipe it is made out of wood and  
there are lots of different sizes. The 
three holed pipe is also his favourite 
thing to make. The bone recorder is the
smallest thing he makes. He carves 17th
century flutes from wood.The big flutes
make a deep sound but the smaller      
flutes are higher.He gets his wood from
one of the biggest wood merchants in   
Britain.The wood he uses is Cherry,    
Boxwood &amp; Sycamore.The thing that takes
longest to make is the gemshorn.No two 
gemshorns are exactly the same. Some   
are long and curved,some are short and 
straight,on some the outside is rough  
and blistery and he has to smooth it   
off.Normally the instruments take      
between six months and a year to make. 
He is making an organ for the Church.  </content>
