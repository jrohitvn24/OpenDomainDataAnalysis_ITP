		<title>13Farming Around Denmead.</title>
		<content>  Agricultural land covers most of the 
 land around Denmead. There are 14     
 small farms in this area. Many small  
 farms are no longer tenant-owned as   
 most of the landowners live away from 
 their farms while managers run them.  
 Some farms are used now only as       
 houses.                               
  Arable farming in this area covers   
 much of the land. Most crops are those
 that get large E.E.C. subsidies,      
 notably Rape Seed. Wheat is also grown
 as are vegetables for local markets.  
  Livestock farming on unsown grass is 
 also important especially dairy       
 farming for the local markets. Horses 
 are important as there are several    
 stables in this area. Sheep are also  
 found grazing in this area.
