		<title>16AMENITIES NEAR SEISDON</title>
		<content>   As will be seen from the data       
recorded, there are very few amenities 
in this block at all and it is         
necessary for the local people to      
travel out of the area for practically 
all their needs.   There are no        
schools, churches, Doctors' surgeries  
or recreational facilities of any      
kind.  Some of their needs can be met  
in one or other of the local villages; 
for others it is necessary to travel to
Bridgnorth, Wolverhampton or the large 
village of Wombourne, three or four    
kilometres to the south-east.          
   Claverley has the usual village     
amenities as do the sister villages of 
Trysull and Seisdon (treated as one for
most purposes).   Both Claverley and   
Trysull and Seisdon have branches of   
the Women's Institute and other groups 
such as sports teams and horticultural 
societies.                             </content>
