		<title>16THE VILLAGE HALL COMMITTEE</title>
		<content>{THE VILLAGE HALL COMMITTEE}was set up 
 in 1978 after an open meeting to      
 discuss the closure of the village    
 hall. The committee runs the {VILLAGE 
{HALL }and the {MEMORIAL HALL}. Both of
 these halls have the {PARISH COUNCIL }
 as trustees. It is the committee's    
 function to raise money to run and    
 maintain the halls. One of the first  
 items was to start a Century Club.    
 Dances are organised as are Cheese and
 Wine parties. Two or three times a    
 year,Pentabus, a travelling theatre   
 group, perform plays, sketches and at 
 Christmas, a pantomime.               
 The committee is made up of           
 representatives of the various        
 organisations in the village and of   
 people who are interested in keeping  
 the hall  for the use of the village.
