		<content> This is an area of undulating         
 landscape and gentle slopes.It        
 straddles an area of higher ground    
 between the industrial areas of the   
 West Midlands and the more            
 agricultural areas of Warwickshire and
 Leicestershire.The whole of the area  
 is in Warwickshire.                   
 A number of small streams begin life  
 in springs just below the summits of  
 the higher areas of land at about 450 
 metres above sea level.These have     
 produced gently sloping valleys.      
 It is on the edge of the Warickshire  
 Coalfield and there were two mines    
 which have now closed leaving areas of
 derelict land.                        
 Three villages grew,Ansley,Ansley     
 Common and Galley Common.Most of the  
 area is in the Parish of Ansley,which 
 was mentioned in the Domesday Book.
