		<content>{THE WILMOT SERVICE STATION            
 The garage was built in 1936. It opens
 at 7.00 a.m. and closes at 10.00 p.m. 
 It is a self service station. About   
 500 people but petrol here every day. 
 Most people buy their petrol in       
 pounds' worth. Four star petrol costs 
 about Â£2.00 per gallon, almost 45p per
 litre. Petrol is delivered here about 
 nine times a month. Two service

 day.
