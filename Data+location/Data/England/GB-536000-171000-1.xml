Our transport these days in London 10th
July 1985 is not very good.The         
transport takes too long to come_      
that's buses.They are always late and  
when they come the buses are packed and
they say only one on top sometimes.    
The old people sometimes have to go up-
stairs and when their not even half way
 up he rings the bell and they could   
easily fall and hurt themselves.And    
when somebody's running for the bus the
conductor does see him or her and rings
the bell so that the bus goes.Some     
people jump on the bus and they could  
easily fall and hurt themselves.On the 
rectangled buses there are 28 seats    
downstairs.And they let them still     
stand on the bus.
