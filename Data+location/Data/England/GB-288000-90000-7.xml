		<content>    Beach Brothers is a small factory  
 owned by two brothers. The business   
 began in Dover in the last century but
 it then came to Exeter in 1940        
 when they took over the building in   
 Western Road,St.Thomas. 50 people are 
 working there. They make things from  
 wood such as bungs for barrels. They  
 make 1,500,000 a year! They sell floor
 tiles of all sorts and special        
 adhesives to shops and tradesmen all  
 over the South of England. They have  
 their own lorries as well. The wood is
 brought from U.S.A and is of a special
 type called red gumwood. The factory  
 has machines for planing wood and for 
 cutting the bungs. Even the shavings  
 and the sawdust are kept and sold for 
 horse litter and butchers shop floors.
 Their wood drying kilns are used by   
 double glazing suppliers for their    
 wooden window parts.                  </content>
