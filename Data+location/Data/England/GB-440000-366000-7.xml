		<title>07WORKING AT HIGH HOUSE FARM</title>
		<content> A staff of seven full time workers,   
 four of whom are qualified in         
 agriculture, are employed on the farm.
 Seasonal workers help out with the    
 harvesting of the barley, wheat and   
 oil seed rape which are the main crops
 grown. A five year rotation system is 
 used for the crops.                   
 Cows and pigs are fattened on the     
 farm. Mr. Taylor has a herd of 120    
 barley fed beef cattle, mainly        
 Friesians, Herefords and Simmentals.  
 The cattle are bought in from a       
 neighbouring farm at eight weeks old  
 and at seven months old, they are sold
 in the fatstock market at Bakewell.   
 450 Large White pigs are also kept on 
 the farm. When they are ready for     
 slaughter at five months old, they are
 sent to Mansfield.
