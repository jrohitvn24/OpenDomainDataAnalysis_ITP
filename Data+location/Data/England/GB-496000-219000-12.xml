		<title>12Totternhoe Church</title>
		<content> The parish church of Totternhoe is    
 named after St. Giles, the patron     
 saint of beggars and cripples.  It is 
 built of local stone.  Services are   
 held every Sunday at 11am. and 6pm.   
 On the second Sunday of the month,    
 services are at 8am. and 11am. with a 
 Family Service at 6pm.  The vicar's   
 name is the Rev. Canon Derek Cook.  He
 is vicar of Stanbridge and Tilsworth  
 as well.  Average weekly attendance at
 St. Giles is about eighty.  There are 
 about 26 members of the choir and 16  
 people take it in turn to ring the    
 peel of eight bells.  Sunday School   
 meets in the Church Hall at 11am with 
 about 30 children on roll.  There are 
 four Sunday School teachers.  The     
 Church is very old and the Churchyard 
 is full of graves.  There is not much 
 room left to bury people when they    
 die.                                  </content>
