		<content>{'LAGGY'}played by girls has two facing
 each other about 2 metres apart,with a
 continuous piece of elastic round     
 their ankles.A third person stands    
 between the strands of elastic and has
 then to jump and try to alternately   
 land on and then avoid landing on the 
 elastic which stretches between the   
 end players{(enders)}.If this is      
 successful then the elastic is slipped
 further up the leg thus making landing
 on it more difficult.{'HOT SOFTBALL'}-
 played by boys and girls involves two 
 teams.There is a batting side and a   
 fielding side.A bowler bowls a soft   
 ball and the batsman has to hit it and
 run to a safe place at the other end  
 of the pitch.A batsman is out if      
 caught,or hit by the ball while       
 running or when the ball goes behind  
 him.The batsmen have to try and get   
 back to the batting place.            </content>
