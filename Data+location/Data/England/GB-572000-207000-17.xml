		<title>17Playground Games</title>
		<content> Our games all involve lots of         
 children. Some use rhymes, balls,     
 skipping ropes,long pieces of elastic 
 or whatever else is in the playground.
 45 home is like hide and seek.One     
 child is called a seeker and a few    
 others are hiders.The seeker closes   
 her eyes and counts to 45 while the   
 others all hide.When the seeker has   
 counted to 45 she shouts,"Coming,     
 Ready or Not".If the seeker sees you, 
 you both run to the post.If the seeker
 gets there first she says,"45"and the 
 hiders name.If the hider gets there   
 first she says,"45 home".If all the   
 other hiders except one get caught the
 last one runs to the post and says,   
 "45 home,save all"and the seeker stays
 seeker for the next game.If the last  
 one is caught the first one that was  
 caught becomes the new seeker.
