 I share a bedroom with my sister      
 Michelle. My sister Sarah has a room  
 of her own.My mum and dad sleep next  
 door to my room. For breakfast I have 
 cereal and then go to Saturday Band. I
 play the guitar and Sarah plays the   
 cornet.  My dad works at Holme Moss,my
 mum looks after playschool.           
 These are some of the things I like :-
 animals, drawing, writing, playing and
 walking. Sometimes I go walking with  
 my Auntie Brenda and my Uncle Geoff.  
 My auntie's dog always pulls us along.
 We have seen squirrels in the trees   
 and the rabbits have made holes       
 in the ground. One of my trees has    
 a nest with some baby birds in.For    
 dinner I sometimes have sausage, chips
 and beans and for tea I sometimes     
 have a sandwich spread sandwich.
