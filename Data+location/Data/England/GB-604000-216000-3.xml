 The church was built in the thirteenth
 century,out of stone specially        
 imported from France,knapped flintwork
 and Roman brick.At the entrance to the
 churchyard is a fine lych gate.The    
 church was built on a hill for defence
 where the ancient roads from Alresford
 and Thorrington meet and continue     
 into the town.It can be seen seventeen
 miles away at sea.In earlier times the
 vicar would set a light on top of the 
 tower on stormy nights to warn passing
 ships.A magnificent view of the       
 surrounding countryside may be seen   
 from the top of the 97ft tower by     
 those fit enough to climb,the 126     
 steps of the narrow spiral staircase. 
   In 1884 the Essex earthquake        
 actually hurled the pinnacle from the 
 top of the tower through to the nave. 
 The pinnacle now stands in the church.</content>
