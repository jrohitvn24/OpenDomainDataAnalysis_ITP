		<content> A number of people in {Eston}and      
{Normanby}were interviewed about       
 pollution. They said that most of     
 the air pollution comes from cars     
 and the surrounding industries.       
 Only four people think that this      
 area has got a litter problem and     
 said that the council should do       
 something about pollution such as     
 putting bigger and brighter bins or   
 by imposing heavier fines. Because    
 of the type of litter we saw, sweet   
 papers etc. we presume that children  
 are mainly responsible for litter in  
 this area.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
