    The Bishops joined with Father     
 McDonald and four other priests who   
 were celebrating their own Silver     
 Jubilee in a Mass of celebration.     
 This was attended by over 40 other    
 priests from the Diocese. The children
 of Holy Family Primary School were    
 given an extra half days holiday as   
 the school hall was being used by the 
 visitors.
