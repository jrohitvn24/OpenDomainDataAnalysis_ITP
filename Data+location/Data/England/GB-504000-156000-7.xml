		<content> The sparing use of insecticides allows
 a wide variety of wild flowers to     
 grow. Some hedges remain and although 
 elms have died out, broad-leaved trees
 and conifers abound. A variety of     
 habitats houses a surprising range of 
 wild life in Ockham, such as game     
 birds, owls, roe deer and many rabbits
 - hares are scarce. Butterflies are   
 increasing. Wild mallard nest by a    
 stream and the RSPB has an observation
 post and boxes here. Kestrels are     
 frequently seen eating birds killed on
 roads. Though fields are less cultivat
 -ed, parkland and horse-paddocks make 
 a good environment for wildlife. The  
 Wey Navigation has affected the area, 
 controlling floods and encouraging ri-
 ver side life. Thames Conservancy slu-
 ice gates further control floods,here 
 &amp; on the Thames. Mosquitoes were a    
 plague until cleared in the 1950's.   </content>
