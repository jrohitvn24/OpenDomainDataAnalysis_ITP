		<content>   Surfing is a sport that many people 
 in Penwith like.Most of the surfers   
 either go to{Gwenver}or{Sennen}beach. 
{Porthcurno}and{Porthlevan}some times  
 have good surf but it is not good all 
 of the time because they are on the   
 South coast and most of the storms and
 hurricanes are in the Atlantic Ocean  
 which means that the best surf is     
 usually to be found on the north and  
 west facing coasts.                   
   People from all over {Great Britain 
 come to stay at{Skewjack,}a Surf      
 village near{Sennen.}Some people come 
 to surf  at {Sennen Surf Club.}But you
 do not stay there. {Skewjack}is a good
 place. It is a whole village. There   
 is a swimming pool,surf shop,and a    
 movie place where you see can see surf
 movies. There is a disco,and a pub.   
 When the surf is flat people practise 
 their skills on skateboards.          </content>
