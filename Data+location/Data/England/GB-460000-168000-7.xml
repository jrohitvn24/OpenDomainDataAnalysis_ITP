		<title>07THE A4 THEALE</title>
		<content> Until the M4 and the Theale by-pass   
 were built the main street through    
 Theale was the A4 which carried much  
 of the east-west traffic in           
 central-southern England. 95 vehicles 
 entered the A4(Theale) from the       
 roundabout. 20 had come from the      
 Theale by-pass, 8 from Wigmore Lane,  
 27 from the A4(Thatcham, 24 from the  
 A340 and 16 had gone once round the   
 roundabout. 44 vehicles went onto the 
 roundabout from the A4(Theale). 11    
 went to the Theale by-pass, 2 to      
 Wigmore Lane, 13 to the A4(Thatcham), 
 2 to the A340 and 16 had gone once    
 round the roundabout. Most of the     
 vehicles going once round the         
 roundabout were coaches from Smith's  
 Commercial Vehicle Repairs. Few       
 vehicles use the roundabout as there  
 is easier access to the M4 and Reading
 at the eastern end of the village.    </content>
