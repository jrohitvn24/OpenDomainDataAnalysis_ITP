		<content> Although{Dewsbury is the main town}in 
 the area, only the western side       
 (Ravensthorpe, Boothroyd and Dewsbury 
 Moor) falls within our block; this    
 excludes the town centre. A large part
 of{Mirfield}occupies the south-west   
 corner, with{Norristhorpe}in the      
 north-west.                           
 It is largely{residential,}but there  
 are substantial areas of open land,   
 which are mainly{farming}fields,      
 public recreational areas, disused    
 industrial sites or waste-land.       
{Textiles}is the predominant{industry, 
 and there are also several small      
 engineering and chemical works.       
 The majority of the population is     
 working class, although parts of      
 Mirfield house executive commuters to 
 surrounding cities. Recently there has
 been a large influx of{Asian families 
 into Ravensthorpe.                    </content>
