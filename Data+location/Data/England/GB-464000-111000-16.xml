		<title>16Denmead's Schools.</title>
		<content>  The pattern of education in Denmead  
 and Wecock has been changing over the 
 past few years. This is because of    
 changing patterns of population       
 dispersal.                            
  In Denmead the old Victorian school, 
 at the eastern end of the village, was
 closed in the 1970's and turned into a
 Community Centre. To replace this an  
 Infants and a Junior School were built
 on seperate sites within the housing  
 development at the west of the        
 village. With new development these   
 may have to be expanded.              
  In Wecock a purpose built modern     
 school has been created very recently.
 Cowplain Wecock First and Middle      
 Schools have a large site and well    
 designed modern facilities. These     
 serve all of Wecock and should not    
 need to expand in the near future.
