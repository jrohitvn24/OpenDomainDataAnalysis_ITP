		<content>       Agriculture is the predominant  
 land use.  It is mainly{dairy         
{farming}with much of the land         
 intensively managed grass; average    
 acreage 100 - 200; average herd 50 -  
 100.  Cattle are mainly Holsteins     
 (Fresians) bred for milk production.  
 Calves(Hereford/Holstein cross-bred)  
 are reared for beef production and    
 sold at a few months to farmers from  
 other areas.                          
      Bulk milk collections are taken  
 to dairies in Manchester for          
 processing and bottling.  The milk is 
 stored in refrigerated tanks on the   
 farms and collected once daily.       
      In summer, cattle graze in the   
 open, often watering at field ponds.  
 In winter, they are kept in large     
 sheds (shippons) and fed silage (or   
 hay) and concentrates.
