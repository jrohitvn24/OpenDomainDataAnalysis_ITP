		<content>    We discovered that most people     
 worked away from the village and that 
 they mostly went by car.Very few      
 people use bikes bacause it is a long 
 way to go anywhere.People mainly shop 
 in Norwich or as a second choice      
 Yarmouth. There are no shops in the   
 village. One person went to Wroxham,  
 there is a shopping centre there      
 called Roys. Norwich is the biggest   
 shopping centre.                      
    Everybody we asked had electricity 
 and water, most of them had a         
 telephone. For heating they had either
 coal, gas or oil. The gas is from a   
 tank in the garden.Only half the      
 people had mains sewage, the others   
 had septic tanks.
