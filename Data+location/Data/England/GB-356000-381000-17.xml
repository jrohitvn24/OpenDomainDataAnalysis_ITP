		<content> The tower was completed in 1982 and   
 stands 76 meteres high. Top scientists
 from all parts of the world visit the 
 site to use some of the best nuclear  
 facilities in the world. The area is  
 well served with a good network of    
 main roads and motorways which        
 fortunately have left Daresbury       
 village unaltered. There are good     
 railway facilities both at Runcorn and
 Warrington and Liverpool and          
 Manchester                            
 Airports are less than 30 minutes     
 drive away. About a mile away there   
 are industrial estates including a    
 science park.
