		<title>09INDUSTRIAL COMPLEXES</title>
		<content> THIS SMALL INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX HOUSES  
 18 PRODUCTION UNITS.  IT IS A TYPICAL 
 LIGHT INDUSTRY AREA PRODUCING SUCH    
 ITEMS AS DOUBLE GLAZED WINDOWS, SAILS 
 AND INDUSTRIAL RUBBER MOULDINGS.  SUCH
 DEVELOPMENTS NEAR SMALL TOWNS AND     
 AMONGST RESIDENTIAL AREAS ARE TYPICAL 
 OF THIS AREA  THOUGH PROVIDING WORK   
 THEY DO MUCH TO DESTROY THE           
 ENVIRONMENT.  ALTHOUGH OFF THE MAIN   
 ROAD IT IS UNSIGHTLY AND LITTLE       
 THOUGHT WAS GIVEN TO AESTHETIC VALUES 
 IN ITS PLANNING. THE GIRLS            
 INVESTIGATING THE AREA SOON BECAME AN 
 OBJECT OF GREAT INTEREST TO WORKMEN   
 EASILY DISTRACTED FROM DAILY TOIL.    
 THIS IS A TYPICAL 1980s REACTION OF   
 THE MALE SEX TO PRETTY GIRLS AND IS   
 MUCH TO BE DEPLORED. HOWEVER, IT ALSO 
 INDICATES THAT MUCH OF THE WORK DONE  
 IS TOO TEDIOUS TO HOLD THE ATTENTION  
 FOR LONG.                             </content>
