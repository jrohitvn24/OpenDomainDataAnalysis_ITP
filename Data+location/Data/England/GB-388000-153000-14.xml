		<title>14Change in the Area.</title>
		<content>      Mrs Pow and Mrs Mills, dinner    
 ladies at the local school, have lived
 in the area since birth. They recalled
 how the village has changed in the    
 last 30 yrs.                          
      Until the 1950's there was no    
 mains water. People used a pump sited 
 opposite the school. There was a small
 shop at 41 Doreen Cotts until 1971.   
 Supermarket competition in Trowbridge 
 closed it down. The P.O. at no.40 ran 
 until 1979. It closed because no      
 permanent replacement could be found  
 when the post mistress Miss Mead died.
 There was a weekly bus service to     
 Trowbridge until 1979.                
      They remember the village as     
 being more sociable when they were    
 young. On Sundays the church was full,
 because most people were employed on  
 the Rood Ashton Estate and were oblig-
 ed to attend.They enjoyed the services</content>
