		<title>19LOCAL ISSUES DOGS AND LITTER</title>
		<content>   Two of the issues that cause a large
 amount of local feeling are the       
 problem of dogs and litter.           
   The problem of dogs fouling the     
 pavements and play areas has been     
 discussed for a number of years and   
 the feelings are that we should not   
 blame the dogs but their owners and   
 that higher dog licences might be the 
 answer to solving this issue.         
   There is also concern on two fronts 
 about the problem of litter.The refuse
 collection service has recently been  
 privatised and there have been        
 suggestions that the service is not   
 good enough.There is also the comment 
 that people of all ages do not take   
 enough pride in their own community   
 and that they must be made to realise 
 that they should look after the place 
 that they live in.
