		<content> Two{playgroups}are based in Bourton-  
 on-the-Water. One of them uses the    
{Youth Centre}and is open each weekday 
 morning between 9.30 and 12 noon. It  
 is run as a private business. The     
 other group uses the{Baptist Church   
{Rooms}and is open at the same times on
 Monday, Thursday and Friday. It is run
 on a community basis with parents     
 committing themselves as helpers.     
 Gloucestershire provides{no pre-school
{education}so each group caters for    
{children of ages 3 to 5,}approximately
 70 children per week in all.          
 Schoolchildren from{Bourton Vale      
{Secondary School}are welcomed into    
 each of these groups as helpers.      
 There is a{Mother and Toddler}group in
 Bourton catering for 12 children of   
 ages 3 months to 3 years on Thursdays 
 from 2-4pm. A similar group is being  
 formed in Little Rissington.          </content>
