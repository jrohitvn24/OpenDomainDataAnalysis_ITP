		<title>05CHILD'S DAY AT SCHOOL</title>
		<content> My name is Hazel Whiteford and I live 
 at Tercrosset Farm,West Hall,BRAMPTON.
 My mam brings me to school by car and 
 as soon as I come in I get my work    
 out.At nine o'clock we have           
 assembly.When we come out we all have 
 to sit down at our tables and we do   
 mathematical tables.When we come back 
 from break we do some English.We have 
 our dinner which is made in a little  
 room near our room .We have our dinner
 in our class room and nobody goes home
 because the children would not have   
 time to go and come back for the      
 afternoon. Before bell we all play    
 games .In the afternoons we do such   
 things as :music, art, games, history,
 science and geography.Then we go out  
 to play.At 3.30pm we go home.         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
