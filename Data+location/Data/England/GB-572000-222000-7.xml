		<title>07Braintree Centre Facilities</title>
		<content>    The centre of Braintree and Bocking
 is a mixture of the old town with a   
 new growth planned by the council.    
 However as much of our history is in  
 this small area we cannot abandon     
 whole areas to the concrete jungle.   
    The area around Bank Street is a   
 rabbit warren of passages and alleys  
 each turning revealing a new face to  
 old Braintree.                        
    One question to  which we cannot   
 find an answer is the provision of    
 toilets in the centre of the town.    
 There are only two sets of public     
 conveniences, one on either side of   
 the main shopping centre. During our  
 interviews with the older residents of
 the area many asked why there could   
 not be more provision made. These     
 older inhabitants also would have     
 enjoyed a greater number of seats in  
 the pedestrianised areas.             </content>
