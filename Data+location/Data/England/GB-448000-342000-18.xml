		<title>18 A Woodland near Strelley</title>
		<content>  {Chilwell Dam Plantation}is a small  
 broadleaved wood which was probably   
 set up about 1800 A.D when Thomas Webb
 Edge who lived at Strelley Hall       
 replanted the woodland within his park
 to make the scenery more attractive   
 and to conceal unpleasant features.   
 The plantation stands on a site of old
 primary woodland and contains evidence
 that it was probably a coppice -      
 standards plantation. The wood has not
 been managed for many years. As the   
 underlying rock is Magnesian Limestone
 there is a rich ground flora in the   
 wood including plants which show that 
 long ago there was an ancient wood on 
 this site. Some of these plants are   
 Yellow Archangel, Bluebell, Cuckoo    
 Pint, Wild Columbine, Wood Anemone,   
 Wild Arum, Campanula species,         
 Dogs' Mercury, Ramsons. A small stream
 flows through the wood.               </content>
