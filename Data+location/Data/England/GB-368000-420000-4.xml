		<title>04The People of Hoddlesden</title>
		<content> From our survey we have found out that
 a lot of people in the village are in 
 the (31-45) &amp; (0-15) age groups.We    
 have decided this was because there   
 are a lot of adults with children that
 fall into these 2 groups.The old      
 people tend to live in the old part of
 the village &amp; a few have lived here   
 all their lives.Many people have moved
 here from the Blackburn area because  
 of their job or marriage, or because  
 they liked the area.A lot of people   
 have cars in the village &amp; the most   
 popular pets are dogs.Most people in  
 the village work full time in industry
 and public service.Most people use the
 post office regularly and the church  
 is well attended.They use the other   
 village amenities occasionally.The    
 community centre is well used by      
 different groups.The mobile facilities
 are not well used.People go to Darwen.</content>
