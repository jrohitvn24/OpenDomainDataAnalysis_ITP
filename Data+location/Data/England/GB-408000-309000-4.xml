		<title>04 Beacon Park</title>
		<content>    Beacon Park used to be a very big  
garden belonging to the Hinkley family.
The garden was passed down the family  
until a man called Swinfen Broun bought
it.Before he died in 1948 he gave the  
12 acres of land to the city as a park.
    Beacon Park has a lot of           
activities  like a children's          
playground, a golf course, football    
pitches, a children's boating lake and 
a tennis court.                        
Beacon Park has a lot of monuments     
and statues. One of these is for the   
Captain of the Titanic and it has a    
fountain in it. Beacon Park is very    
popular on Saturday because people     
leave their older children there while 
they do their shopping.                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
