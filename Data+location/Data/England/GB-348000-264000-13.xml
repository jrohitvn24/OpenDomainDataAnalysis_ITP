		<title>13    OUR HEADMISTRESS</title>
		<content> We interviewed our Headmistress about 
 her life, here is what she told us.   
 She lives in a village two and a half 
 miles from school. She has a brother  
 and a sister who live near Hereford   
 with her mother and father. She has   
 been here for nearly three years. She 
 has taught at six other schools. The  
 thing she likes about teaching is     
 helping children to do things they    
 find difficult. Her hobbies are       
 painting, drawing, tennis, badminton, 
 gardening and listening to music. She 
 says it is difficult being a teacher  
 and a Head because there are a lot of 
 interruptions during class time. When 
 she was little she used to like       
 puzzles, balls, skipping and dolls.   
 She still has a doll in her attic. She
 thought she might like to be an air   
 -hostess so that she could travel, or 
 be a teacher when she grew up.        </content>
