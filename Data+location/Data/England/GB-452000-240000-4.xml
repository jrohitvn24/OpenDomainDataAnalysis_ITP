		<content> RAF Greatworth was started in 1943. A 
 signals convoy set up a temporary     
 station on the site. Two huts were    
 later erected on the site and the Air 
 Ministry made RAF Greatworth permanent
 in 1953.                              
 The Detachment based at Greatworth has
 housing for single airmen and twelve  
 married quarters. There is also an    
 officer's quarter for the Detachment  
 Commander.                            
 The children's education takes them to
 the local primary school and at       
 present there are five children       
 attending school.                     
 The Commander of the base allows local
 clubs to us the Detachment's football 
 pitch. The officers and men of the    
 camp are involved in a great many     
 aspects of village life. Many take    
 responsibilities within the local     
 teams, organisations and clubs.       </content>
