		<title>10Warkton's tale, Kettering.</title>
		<content>   One day during the first world war a
young mother and her baby were seen in 
Warkton.                               
   The mother called at a cottage and  
was given milk by the occupier who     
noticed that she seemed to be very     
distressed.                            
   Apparently her husband was fighting 
abroad and news from the front was not 
at all good.                           
   Later that day the child's body was 
found lying in a pool of blood in the  
church porch.                          
   With the porch defiled another      
entrance had to be used until          
the Bishop had reconsecrated it.       
   A lady we met told us that when she 
was a child she could remember the     
black mark made by the blood.  Nobody  
dared to step on it as they went in to 
Sunday School!                         
   This is a sad but true story.       </content>
