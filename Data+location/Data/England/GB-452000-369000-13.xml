		<content> Friday                                
 On Friday we break,                   
 For two days off school.              
 We don't go at weekends,              
 Because it's the rule.                
 It's guides every week.               
 I like it a lot.                      
 We often go walks,                    
 When the weather is hot.              
 Saturday                              
 No school on Saturday.                
 I stay at home on Saturday.           
 Where I often read a book.            
 But if my mum is baking.              
 I'll stop and help her cook.          
 Sunday.                               
 Home all day on Sunday.               
 I hear the church bell,               
 Clearly it rings.                     
 I attend the morning service,         
 Where the congregation sings.{
