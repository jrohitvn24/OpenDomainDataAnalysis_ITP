		<title>02A DAY IN MY LIFE - 28TH JUNE</title>
		<content> I got up at a quarter to nine Friday  
 morning on the 28th of June.  I had   
 toast and Frosties for breakfast at   
 nine and then got dressed.  At quarter
 past nine I washed my hair and then   
 played on the Sinclair ZX Spectrum    
 computer.  At ten o'clock our horse   
 riding lesson started so we left here 
 at quarter to ten.  We went out for a 
 hack and got back at eleven.  When we 
 got back I had a salad for dinner.    
 After dinner I sat down and watched   
 television.  After that I had a game  
 of tennis with my sister.  By that    
 time it was late afternoon so I got on
 my bike and went down to Old Buckenham
 and met one of my friends and then    
 came home for tea.  I had roast beef, 
 Yorkshire pudding, cauliflower, gravy,
 potatoes.  After tea I watched        
 television awhile and then at nine    
 o'clock I got ready for bed.          </content>
