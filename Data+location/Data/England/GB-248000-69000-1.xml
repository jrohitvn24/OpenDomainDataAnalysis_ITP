 Housing in and around Horrabridge is  
 fairly mixed.Old houses are not very  
 often demolished but redecorated      
 inside.Near the centre of{Horrabridge 
 the houses are the oldest,the public  
 houses and shops are here also.The    
 further up the side of the valley you 
 go,the more modern the houses.All the 
 houses are built in roughly the same  
 way.Most have cavity walls and an "A" 
 frame holding up the roof;some old    
 houses do not have a cavity,relying on
 thick walls for insulation.The roof is
 built of tiles made of asbestos,slate 
 or concrete.The{farmhouses}outside    
 Horrabridge are fairly old.Sortridge  
 Manor is very old and can be traced   
 from 1500 . The{school}has slate tiles
 and is partly made from granite.
