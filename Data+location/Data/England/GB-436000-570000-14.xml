Most of the pupils live by the sea so a
lot of them do water sports out of     
school.These include canoeing,wind     
surfing and swimming in the sea.Other  
activities are going to the roller and 
ice-rinks,playing tennis on the courts 
provided at the sea front and playing  
in the amusements.                     
Many pupils live in large terraced     
houses with a lot of rooms.The majority
have front and back gardens and a      
garage.                                
During the school holidays most        
families go abroad and some own        
cottages in the country.Others stay at 
home and make the most of the weather. 
   Most pupils thought that their most 
memorable experience was getting on    
school teams.
