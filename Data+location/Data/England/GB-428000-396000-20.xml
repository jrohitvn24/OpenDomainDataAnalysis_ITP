		<content>    Many families have lived in these  
 areas for generations. Despite its    
 expansion,{Deepcar}still maintains    
 its village identity. There is an     
 insular, parochial and aloof attitude 
 towards{Sheffield,}only 8 miles away. 
 People in{Stocksbridge,}1 mile away,  
 generally regard Deepcar as having an 
 air of superiority. New inhabitants   
 ('comers-in') are accepted slowly but 
 relationships once formed are firm,   
 sincere ones. A survey of the estate  
 (88 people) showed 64% adults not born
 in Deepcar and 84% have lived there   
 for less than 20 yrs.                 
    The{Wharncliffe}farming community  
 similarly is a closely-knit one       
 centred on{Wortley.}The Wharncliffe   
 Estate is still influential.
