		<content> Underlying the area are the Pennine   
 sandstones known as gritstone. They   
 are interspersed with coal bearing    
 shale bands which often outcrop on the
 surface due to the tilted strata and  
 several minor faults. There are many  
 small coal pits, now worked out and   
 capped for safety by the National Coal
 Board. Mining was an important local  
 industry in the last century.         
  Numerous stone buildings and walls   
 testify to the ease of quarrying rock 
 which is so close to the surface and  
 one large quarry is still working.    
  The Red Rock Fault crosses Adlington 
 in a north/south direction near the   
 western boundary of the block.Here the
 shales dip sharply below pebble beds  
 overlaid with clay and sand, which    
 produce a much softer landscape than  
 the thinner soils and more broken     
 ground of the hills to the east.      </content>
