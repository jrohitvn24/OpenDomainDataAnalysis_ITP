      Our area includes{Shawbury       
{R.A.F base}and two villages.They are {
{Grinshill}and {Shawbury.}The largest  
 of these villages is Shawbury. The    
 R.A.F station takes up one quarter of 
 the area. The rest of the area is     
 covered by{farmland}with some{        
{woodland.}The woodland is mainly      
{deciduous}trees. Most of the farmland 
 is covered by crops.                  
         There are two schools in our  
 area. These are {St. Mary's C.E.School
 which is a primary school and{Acton   
{Reynalds school,}which is a girls     
 boarding school.
