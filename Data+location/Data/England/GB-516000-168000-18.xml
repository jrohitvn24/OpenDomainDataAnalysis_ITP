		<title>18FOOTBALL, KINGSTON</title>
		<content> There used to be an annual football   
 match played every {Shrove Tuesday.}  
 The Mayor watched the game from       
 outside the old Town Hall in the      
 market place.  The pitch was from {   
{Clattern Bridge}to{Kingston Bridge}by 
 way of the{Market place}and{Thames    
{Streeet.} One side represented        
 Kingston people of the day and the    
 other side represented the Danes.  The
 game celebrated Kingston's victory    
 over the Danes in the Eighth Century. 
 The football represented the Danish   
 leaders head.  The game got so        
 exciting and rowdy that shops were    
 forced to barricade their windows.  In
 1850 the pitch was moved to the       
{Fairfield,}but because of this it was 
 not so popular and stopped in 1867.   
 So perhaps the game of football       
 started in Kingston.
