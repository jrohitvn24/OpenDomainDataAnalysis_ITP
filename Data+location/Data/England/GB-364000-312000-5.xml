		<title>05Hadley Shopping Centre</title>
		<content> Hadley is a very modern shopping      
 centre.On most days it is quiet but on
 Wednesdays it is noisy because of the 
{market.}The atmosphere is very        
 nice,cheerful and friendly.There are  
 not many stalls but they are very     
 cheap and sometimes you can get a     
 bargain.                              
 In the centre there are several       
 different kinds of shops:Stars        
 newsagent,Co-op,library,chemist,fish  
 and chips,clothes shop,pet shop,wine  
 shop,bakers,veg shop,fancy goods and  
 butchers.There is also an optician,a  
 bank,the information centre,a building
 society and a hairdresser.Cars are not
 allowed in the centre because there is
 a car park at the back.There is a     
 Methodist church.Across from the shops
 is a pub called The Kings Head which  
 is very popular.
