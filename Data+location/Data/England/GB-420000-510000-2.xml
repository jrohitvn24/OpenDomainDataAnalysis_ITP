		<content>   Each  year,   in {mid-August,}  the 
 village  celebrates its {Annual Feast}
 which covers a full week. The origins 
 of the present day feast are believed 
 to lie in the{charter of 1281}granted 
 to{John, Earl of Richmond}by{Edward I}
 for the purpose of  holding a {yearly 
{fair}on the{vigil feast and morrow of 
{St. Michael.}       The  present  day 
 celebrations are organised by a comm- 
 ittee of local residents.  The events 
 begin with a  gymkhana  on the Monday 
 for children and their ponies. During 
 the  rest  of  the  week,  there  are 
 village sports; quoits;dancing around 
 the maypole; a  vegetable and produce 
 show; a dance in the village hall and 
 an open air service.   Members of the 
{Showmen's Guild}bring their fairground
 rides and sideshows  onto the part of 
 the  green in front of the   Stanwick 
 Arms and open on Monday &amp; Tuesday.    </content>
