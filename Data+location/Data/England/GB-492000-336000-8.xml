		<title>08BELTON ESTATE.</title>
		<content> This park and 600 acres of farmland   
 were created by the 18th century      
 landscape designer Capability Brown.  
 The N &amp; W is dominated by the         
 Estate features. During the last 150  
 years some specimen trees &amp; shrubs    
 from S Europe and America have been   
 introduced. A Nature Conservancy      
 survey revealed a rich variety of over
 120 trees &amp; plant species along with  
 an abundant &amp; intersting wildlife.    
 Belton has its own Nature Trail which 
 passes through a wide selection of    
 varied species.  One of the finest a  
 Cedar of Labanon imported in 1638,    
 stands as a direct geographical       
 contrast to 90ft tall Norwegian       
 spruces. Grey squirrels, from North   
 America thrive here. Great crested    
 grebe, Canada geese, nuthatch and     
 greater spotted woodpecker are just   
 some of the amazing bird life.        </content>
