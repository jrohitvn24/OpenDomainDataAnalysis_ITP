 SAINT LUKE'S CHURCH OF ENGLAND        
 This school was opened in January     
 1864,for 76 pupils.By 1884 there were 
 167 children registered although few  
 attended regularly as they were needed
 to work in the fields and many        
 families could not afford the few     
 pence asked.                          
 In 1954,due to lack of funds,the      
 church asked for the school to be     
 taken over by the State and became    
 Voluntary Controlled.Much needed      
 improvements were then able to take   
 place.                                
 MILLDENE COUNTY PRIMARY               
 Due to the population explosion of the
 1960's a new primary school was needed
 and Milldene Primary School was opened
 in September 1968 with 215 pupils.
