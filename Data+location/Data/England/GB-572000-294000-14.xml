		<title>14EMPLOYMENT IN METHWOLD</title>
		<content>     Employment in Methwold            
   We interviewed all the owners of    
 businesses in Methwold to find out how
 many people are employed in the       
 village.                              
     There is a total of 274 people    
 employed in the village, 136 men and  
 138 women.Some of these people work in
 shops, garages, schools or farms, but 
 the majority are employed in food     
 preparation, a tubular steel factory  
 and a tree nursery.                   
      Many Methwold people travel to   
 the nearby towns of Brandon and       
 Thetford to work in the factories     
 there, and a considerable number are  
 employed in seasonal work at the      
 Wissington Sugar Beet Factory.
