		<content> The populations of Great Paxton and   
 the Offords has risen sharply in the  
 past ten years due to  the building of
 many new houses. These have been      
 mainly 3 or 4 bedroom detached houses 
 and in 1985 a 4 bedroom one would cost
 around Â£60,000.In Great Paxton around 
 200 houses have been built and the    
 population has gone up to 860. In     
 Offord the population is 1090.The     
 housing developements in Offord are   
 smaller and more spread than in       
 Paxton.Offord has many more older and 
 more varied styles of houses than in  
 Paxton.On visits to Offord we saw     
 thatched properties,victorian houses, 
 pre_1939 houses and modern detached,  
 semi_detached,chalet bungalows,       
 bungalows and terraced houses. In     
 Paxton we noted four thatches.
