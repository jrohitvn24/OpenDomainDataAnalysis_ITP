{FAIR BY ANTHONY                       
 On Saturday we had a summer fair at   
 school,it started at 1:45pm.There were
 different kinds of stalls in the small
 playground,and in the large playground
 country dancing and gymnastics took   
 place.There was also a football game  
 and a large trampoline.In our school  
 hall there were stalls selling jumble.
 At 3:15pm about 40 people sang        
 different kinds of songs.In the car   
 park there was a fire engine which you
 could look inside of,and a few other  
 new or old cars.Lots of people were   
 making water bombs.This is where you  
 have won a balloon,fill it up with    
 water and throw it.There were also    
 competitions for Air-Fix models and   
 miniature gardens.The most expensive  
 thing there was the bowls.This was    
 20p.                                  </content>
