		<content>    Animal rearing is also important.  
 The main animals kept are pigs and    
 beef cattle. All farms keep poultry.  
 Main markets for the animals are the  
 auction markets at Darlington,        
 Stockton and Thirsk.                  
   All of the farms use a large amount 
 of machinery. Each farmer owns at     
 least three tractors and one combine  
 harvester. Although there is all of   
 this machinery the field sizes are    
 still small, with hedgerows forming   
 the boundaries.                       
   Work on the farms is done mainly by 
 the farmers and their families, with  
 very few full time employees. Part    
 time workers are mainly taken on in   
 September, for the potato picking     
 season and harvest time.
