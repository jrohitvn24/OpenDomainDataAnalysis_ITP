  The central part of the village,     
around the church is of old houses,    
farms and cottages built in local      
limestone. (Slide B)                   
  Cottages dating from the late 1800's 
surround this central area and are     
mainly brick. The outskirts of the     
village have three different types of  
housing. There is an unlovely brick and
concrete council estate. The most      
modern houses, both on a small estate  
and on individual plots are            
thoughtfully designed and constructed. 
A small group of retirement bungalows  
stands beside the church.              
  Outside the village is a house called
'Three Chimneys' (Slide D). This is a  
local landmark and is shown on O.S.    
maps.
