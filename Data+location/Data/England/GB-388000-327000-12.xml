		<title>12WHITGREAVE A LOCAL VILLAGE.</title>
		<content>    Whitgreave,or White grove as it was
 originally,is approached from the A34 
 by a twisting lane ,hedge-lined and   
 slightly sunken.The 40 or so houses   
 are mainly along the one road,though a
 few are along one side of a smaller   
 lane that is at right-angles to it.   
    The older houses and the church are
 at the top of the slight hill that the
 road climbs,while the others are      
 scattered along either side of the    
 road.The village has doubled in size  
 this century.The newer houses tend to 
 be at either end of the village.      
    The general appearance is one of   
 quiet,with very little traffic and    
 very few people about.Gardens are well
 kept,many having trees in them,giving 
 a sheltered picture.The road is lined 
 with hedges or flower-beds.Most       
 houses are brick built,though one     
 whichis timber framed is about 400    </content>
