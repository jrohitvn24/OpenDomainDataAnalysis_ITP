		<title>06   ROADWATER VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The small village of Roadwater        
 stretches along the valley of the     
 Washford river and has only one road  
 leading up to the Brendon Hills. There
 are two parts.{Lower Roadwater,}where 
 most of the newer building has been   
 done and the main village, where the  
 shops used to be.There are a number   
 of very old thatched cottages and some
 unusually high older buildings, but   
 many new houses have been built in    
 recent years. Also people have        
 extended old houses or changed them   
 for other uses. For instance the      
{Temperance Hall,}built 110 years ago  
 for the miners in the hills,has been  
 converted into a house.The barn at    
{Vale House,}is being changed into an  
 office.{The Valiant Soldier,}a popular
 local pub, has a skittle alley, and   
 the butchers shop that used to be next
 door is now the ladies toilet.        </content>
