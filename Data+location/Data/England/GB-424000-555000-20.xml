		<content>   There are two main means of         
 transport which go through Birtley.   
 There is a railway which links London 
 to Edinburgh on the western side.     
 Inter City 125s run on this line. The 
 other main means of transport is the  
 A1(M) which runs at the North East of 
 Birtley. All kinds of vehicles run    
 along the A1(M) like long distance    
 buses, vans, lorries and cars.        
    There is a Marshalling Yard down by
 the railway. At the Marshalling Yard  
 the workers there make up trains,     
 mostly goods trains, which carry oil  
 and coal. There are lots of buses     
 which go through Birtley every day.   
 Lots of people in Birtley have cars   
 and vans.
