		<title>14Retford's Canal</title>
		<content> The{Chesterfield Canal}was completed  
 in 1777.The canal used to link        
 Shireoaks and Worksop to Retford and  
 the river Trent at Stockwith.         
 Its chief purpose was to transport    
 coal from Derbyshire pits.Mudford's of
 Retford make canvas tents today and   
 are a present day link with the       
 hop,sail-cloth,tile-making and gravel 
 industries of the past.               
{Grove Mill}dates from 1838 and        
 has functioned as maltkiln            
 and flour mill.It will soon be        
 converted into a Pool Hall.           
 The{Packet Inn}was a passenger stop at
 Gas House Bridge along a stretch of   
 canal linking{Retford Marina}to the   
 Hop Pole.The hop fields are now gone  
 but their influence remains with the  
 Hop Pole Inn.                         
 The{canal is navigable}to Worksop and 
 as far as the Trent Eastwards.        </content>
