		<title>20    BETLEY IN THE 1930's</title>
		<content>     Mr.Foster lived in Betley in the  
1930's.The highlight of every year was 
the Shrove Tuesday dance,where every-  
ones mum made them special clothes.In  
those days there was hardly any traffic
on the roads,the main motor vehicles   
were the Evening Sentinal newspaper van
and the bus from  Crewe to Newcastle.  
There were no T.V sets and only a few  
radio's. Betley had its own fire engine
and Mr.Foster only knew of it going out
once to a thatched cottage in          
Wrinehill. Mr.Foster's allowance       
was 2 shillings a week.Two important   
things that happened were the coming of
the electric light and piped water.The 
boys used to wear jerseys and cloggs   
with metal tips and the girls used to  
wear pinefores.Sometimes a fox hunt    
met in Betley and the boys used to     
wait along by the side of gates and    
open them when the hunt came near.     </content>
