		<title>18Thoughts on Terrorism.</title>
		<content>   Many people in the area are         
 concerned about terrorism in 1985.    
 Some think that it is murder with no  
 hope of succeeding in its aims.       
   When terrorists kill innocent people
 it is a act of murder and should be   
 treated as such.                      
   Many people are frightened of flying
 in planes because of the recent       
 skyjackings.                          
   This year terrorism has become much 
 worse.We think that terrorists should 
 achieve their aims democratically and 
 not kill innocent people.
