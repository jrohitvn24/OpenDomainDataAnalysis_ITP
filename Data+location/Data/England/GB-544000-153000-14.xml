		<title>14BIRDS AT BRASTED SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Every year in May,house martins       
 come to our school from Africa repair 
 nests from the year before and build  
 new ones.They use the mud from the    
 banks of the River Darenth.The nests  
 are built under the eaves of the      
 school roof and joined to the wall.The
 birds line it with soft               
 material.sometimes one is occupied by 
 a sparrow that has long grasses       
 hanging out untidily. The martins eat 
 insects caught on the wing.One partner
 with food swoops over the playing     
 children until the other flies out to 
 catch more food. To help the young to 
 fly the parents take them on to the   
 school roof and encourage them to fly 
 to the ground. This continues until   
 they are strong enough to migrate in  
 October.Many perish on the way.
