		<title>10THE WORK ON THE A47 BYPASS</title>
		<content> The A47 road in our area used to      
 continue through Blofield. One of our 
 staff lives near where they were      
 re-designing the{by-pass.}She told us 
 that the scheme started in 1981 and   
 finished in 1983. It took that time   
 because in winter the ground was too  
 wet to move and lift. They kept the   
{traffic}moving fairly well while they 
 did the work, she did not have to use 
 different routes. The{machines}were   
 very noisy and if you had a window    
 open in your house you could hardly   
 hear yourself speak. There was dust   
 flying about everywhere too. She was  
 very glad when the work was finished. 
 The scheme cost over Â£1,000,000. It   
 was important because the A47 links   
{Norfolk}to the{Midlands.              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
