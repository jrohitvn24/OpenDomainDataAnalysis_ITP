		<title>18A Day at school</title>
		<content> On Monday in the morning we come in   
 and do our spellings.Then we go out   
 and line up for swimming.While we are 
 waiting for the coach we usually      
 talk.When we get to RNAS Culdrose     
 sports centre we take the swimming    
 floats and hoops.We go in groups in   
 the pool.                             
 When we are back in school we get the 
 tables out ready for dinner.After     
 dinner we do some english.Then after  
 playtime we either do needlework or   
 literature.At playtime we play 40-40. 
 This is played by as many people as   
 you like.One person is it and the     
 others hide.He counts up to 40 and    
 then goes to look for the people who  
 are hiding.If he sees one he runs back
 to the post and says 40-40 out and    
 their name.If the person who is hiding
 gets to the post before the person who
 is it he is in.                       </content>
