		<content> Both parishes now have small popu-    
 lations,171 in Bedingham in 1981,172  
 in Hedenham.This compares with 293 in 
 Bedingham in 1881 &amp; 281 in Hedenham;  
 but in spite of the changes in recent 
 years,some 30% of the people are from 
 families who have lived here or nearby
 for 2 generations or more.Bedingham   
 had 8 under-5s,37 of 5-16 years,111   
 between 16-64,15 at 65+ (1 85+) in    
 1981;Hedenham was similar with 11 0-4 
 years old, 31 of school age,&amp; 130     
 adults,17 being over 64 (4 over 85).  
 The dramatic drop in population,partly
 caused by farm mechanisation,has meant
 non-viable{schools;}Bedingham's was   
 closed 1906,Hedenham's 1947-50 so     
 children travel outside the area;they 
 mostly go to County Primary Schools at
 Woodton or Ditchingham &amp; for secondary
 education to High Schools at Loddon,  
 Norwich,Framingham Earl or Bungay.    </content>
