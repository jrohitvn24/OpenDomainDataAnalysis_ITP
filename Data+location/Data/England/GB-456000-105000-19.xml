		<content>            The local police station   
 houses about one hundred staff.As with
 most areas of the country there is a  
 special motorway unit for dealing with
 any incidents on the motorway         
 itself.The town is not a particularly 
 lawless place but spates of vandalism 
 plague the town from time to time.    
            The shopping prescinct has 
 its own security staff but the police 
 are called in if necessary.           
            In recent years the running
 of a local marathon and suchlike      
 events has meant a different kind of  
 policing but again mainly to do with  
 traffic.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
