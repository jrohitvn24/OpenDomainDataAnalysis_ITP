 A typical day in the farming community
 can be seen from the point of view of 
 the farmer or farmer's wife.The farmer
 spends his day attending to the stock 
 in the pens,inspecting sheep and other
 livestock in the fields and,on a dairy
 farm,milking the cows.During the day  
 routine maintenance of buildings,     
 machinery, fences, hedges and gates is
 carried out with weekly trips to the  
 livestock market at Hatherleigh to    
 sell and buy stock and meet other     
 farmers.Other seasonal tasks include  
 hay and silage making, combining,     
 ploughing and shearing.               
     The farmer's wife spends much time
 doing household chores,preparing meals
 and cooking;most are not active in    
 farm-work but help as required.Some   
 tend poultry and much time is spent   
 cultivating the kitchen garden.       </content>
