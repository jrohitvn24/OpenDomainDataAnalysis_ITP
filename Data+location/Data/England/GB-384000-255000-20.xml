		<title>20GAMES CHILDREN PLAY.</title>
		<content>  We divided childrens' games into     
 sections:{skipping,running,jumping,   
{board-games,party,ball}and{card games.
  We counted 130 games and 59 of them  
 were described.Most of the activities 
 were indoors because of the wide      
 selection of board and electronic     
 games children could choose from.     
{

{netball}and{running games}to keep     
 warm.In the summer time we have much  
 more variety:{rounders,cricket,}and
