		<title>10NEW IBSTOCK SURGERY _ 2</title>
		<content>   The new Ibstock surgery,{Ibstock    
{House,}is open at the following times 
 _                                     
  {Monday to Friday 8.30am - 6.00pm    
{  Wednesday 8.30am - 10.30am          
{  (emergencies only)                  
   It serves patients from Ibstock and 
 surrounding villages. A local health  
 visitor is based at the surgery. The  
 doctors take night calls and any      
 emergencies are sent to one of the    
 three Leicester hospitals on a rota   
 basis.                                
   Ibstock people are no more or less  
 healthy than people in other parts of 
 Britain. However, many chest problems 
 are directly related to the local     
 mining industry.                      
   When the Domesday researchers       
 visited the surgery they were         
 impressed by the welcome and efficient
 attention given to them.              </content>
