		<title>02EMPLOYMENT IN MINSTERLEY</title>
		<content> At Minsterley Church we looked at the 
 marriage registers that the vicar     
 brought out for us .We compared jobs  
 in 1845 to 1850 with jobs in 1985 by  
 asking the other children in school   
 what jobs their parents do.           
         Most people in 1845 worked    
 close to Minsterley,nowadays many work
 in Shrewsbury.                        
         In 1845 most local men were   
 either miners at nearby Snailbeach, or
 farmers or farmworkers.Most girls were
 domestic servants or stayed at        
 home.Now many of the fathers and      
 mothers work at the creamery or the   
 food factory.                         
         Overleaf is a breakdown of    
 jobs amongst men &amp; women in 1845-50.
