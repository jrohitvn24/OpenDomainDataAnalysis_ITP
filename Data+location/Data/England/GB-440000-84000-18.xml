		<content>       Approximately one third of the  
 area of this block is covered by the  
{Brighstone Forest}which extends from  
 east to west along the ridge of chalk 
 hills collectively known as the{Downs.
 Planting began in 1919. The trees are 
 mainly conifers with an area to the   
 north of maturing beech. There are a  
 few ash, sycamore and sweet chestnut. 
       The{Forestry Commission}is      
 responsible for the Brighstone Forest 
 and controls both tree planting and   
 felling. Much of the timber is used   
 for fencing posts and pit props.      
 Private individuals can buy a seasonal
 licence, presently #5.00 per annum, to
 collect fallen branches for firewood. 
       A number of{bridleways}pass     
 through the forest as does the        
{Tennyson Trail.}The public are welcome
 to use these for horse riding and     
 walking.                              </content>
