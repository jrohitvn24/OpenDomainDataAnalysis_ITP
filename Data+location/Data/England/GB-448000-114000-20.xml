		<title>20THE OLD BAKERY.</title>
		<content> The Old Bakery is situated in         
 Parsonage Lane,Durley.It is now two   
 dwelling places but used to be two    
 bakeries.One was built just over one  
 hundred years ago,the other was built 
 around 1912 and carried on trading    
 until about 15 years ago.             
 Around the time of the Second World   
 War a loaf cost about 4.5 old pence,  
 which is just over one new penny.A    
 loaf in 1985 costs about 38 new pence.
 The Bakery used about 800 pounds of   
 flour each day.Brown and white bread  
 was baked but more white bread was    
 sold.Cakes were also made daily.      
 The bread was taken out of the ovens  
 by a peel which is about one meter    
 long with a flat bladed scoop on the  
 end.The ovens were heated by burning  
 faggots which are bundles of sticks   
 tied tightly together.                
 The bakery is now called Hedgerows End</content>
