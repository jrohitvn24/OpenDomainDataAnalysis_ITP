		<content>   THE BRISTOL CHANNEL ACTS AS A FUNNEL
ESPECIALLY FOR WESTERLY AND NORTH      
WESTERLY WINDS.WHEN SUCH GATES COINCIDE
WITH SPRING TIDES,THEN FLOODING IS A   
SERIOUS POSSIBILITY IN THIS AREA.OVER  
THE COURSE OF HISTORY MANY FLOODS HAVE 
BEEN RECORDED,THE MOST RECENT BEING    
THAT OF 13th DECEMBER 1981.            
   ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION,THE TIDE
HAD TURNED WHEN THE WIND CHANGED TO    
NORTH WEST AND INCREASED TO GALE FORCE 
EIGHT.SEA WATER BUILT UP AND FLOODED   
PARTS OF UPHILL TO A DEPTH OF THREE    
FEET.                                  
   AS A RESULT OF THIS AND FLOODING    
ALONG THE WHOLE OF THE SOMERSET COAST  
LINE NORTH OF THE PARRETT ESTUARY,     
EXTENSIVE NEW SEA DEFENCES WERE        
PLANNED.THESE INCLUDE A MASSIVE        
CONCRETE WELL ACROSS THE PILL AND NEW  
EXTENSIVE EARTHEN WALLS.
