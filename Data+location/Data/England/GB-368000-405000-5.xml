		<title>05Our Area</title>
		<content> Our study showed that our area is     
 mainly grassland. It does not feel    
 like it however because where we play 
 is mainly buildings. Sometimes the    
 neighbours shout when our ball goes in
 their garden. There is a swimming     
 baths nearby but it is old so we get  
 the bus to the Sports Centre at       
 Atherton when we want to go swimming. 
 There is a park with swings, slide    
 etc. There is a factory with a massive
 car park. We go there to play games on
 Saturdays and Sundays. There are lots 
 of clubs at school but you have to do 
 as you are told. There is a Sports    
 Centre at our school, Hayward, but it 
 gets full. In Summer there are a lot  
 of things to do but in Winter there is
 nothing. There are a few shops selling
 sweets and toys but you have to catch 
 the bus into the town centre if you   
 want anything special.                </content>
