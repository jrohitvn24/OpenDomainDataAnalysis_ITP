		<content> In the past few years a village fair  
 has developed through the ideas of a  
 travelling theatre company called     
 "Diabalo"IT takes place during July.  
 The fair originally called the "Dragon
 Fair"has a short play as a finale     
 acted out by the theatre company,using
 large puppets made by local children  
 in school and evening workshops held  
 the proceeding week.All clubs and     
 committees have stalls and fire       
 eaters,jugglers and dancers entertain.
 this year the theme has been changed  
 to a "Butterfly Fair."                
 the same theatre group organise a     
 bonfire celebration and again use     
 large scale puppets to act out a story
 with a moral.Local children are also  
 invited to help out in this.          
 Both events are attended by two to    
 three thousand people.
