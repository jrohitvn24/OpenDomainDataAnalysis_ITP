		<title>07 A Farm in Wilby</title>
		<content> The farm we visited in Wilby is       
situated just off the main road. It is 
a small farm of only 600 acres which is
worked by the farmer &amp; two other men.  
It has four tractors and a combine     
harvester which are kept in the farm   
buidings close to home.Although the    
farm is mainly arable it does have 100 
cattle which are reared for beef and a 
few hens which lay 30 to 40 eggs each  
week. The main crops this year are     
rape, kale,potatoes,peas and corn.     
 The farmer's year begins in autumn    
with ploughing,drilling and the sowing 
of seeds.In winter when the ground is  
hard,the workers attend to the ditches 
and fences which have to be repaired.  
In spring the young plants have to be  
sprayed to stop pests and diseases.    
Summer is a busy time with the         
harvesting of crops before the year    
begins again in the autumn.            </content>
