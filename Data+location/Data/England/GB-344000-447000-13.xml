		<title>13S.Luke's Church-Winmarleigh</title>
		<content> Built in 1876 at a cost o9f Â£2000 to  
 Lord Winmarleigh, this small Victorian
 Gothic Church of{S.Luke}sits at the   
 centre of the village geographically. 
 In recent years it has lost its total 
 independence and is part of the United
 Benefice with{S.Michael's,}Cockerham, 
 with whom it shares a vicar,unideally 
 resident in Cockerham.                
 The edifice itself is unexceptional   
 save for an unusual wooden spire and  
 Victorian decoration of the ceiling of
 the chancel and the walls of the nave.
 Plaques, recording the works of the   
 chief benefactor and his family, adorn
 the walls, and, the Bishop's Chair is 
 that of a former Bishop of Soder and  
 Man,an ancestor of Lord Winmarleigh's.
 The church is at present in the       
{Deanery of Garstang}but plans are     
 afoot to move to{Lancaster Deanery}as 
 well as join with{Glasson Parish.     </content>
