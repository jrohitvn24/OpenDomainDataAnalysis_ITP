           I wanted to know how the    
families of the children at our school 
lived.So I asked all the First Years   
some questions.I found out that 12.3%  
had three people in their household,   
47.6% had four people,27.6% had five   
people,6% had more than six people in  
their house.                           
           I found out that 23% of the 
families had children under five years 
of age,and that only 1.5% had          
Grandparents living with them.Non had  
non-relatives living at home.          
           My name is Michael Dale. My 
family has four people.My parents work 
but my brother,aged 21,is unemployed,  
but he has been on a bricklaying       
course.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
