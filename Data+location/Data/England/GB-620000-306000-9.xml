		<title>09HOW I SPEND SATURDAY</title>
		<content>  I get up at 7.00a.m. and go          
 downstairs, switch on the television  
 and make myself a cup of tea. I watch 
 the T.V. until about 9.30. By this    
 time my parents are awake, so I go    
 upstairs to have a shower and get     
 dressed. Then I have some breakfast   
 and a cup of tea. On most Saturdays I 
 go to the City. I take some money and 
 a door key, take my bicycle from the  
 shed and ride along Newmarket Road to 
 the City. I chain my bicycle to the   
 subway railings and go to several     
 shops before collecting my bicycle and
 riding home.                          
  I have a snack lunch and then I look 
 after my sister. At about 7.00p.m. we 
 have a cooked meal, and then I watch  
 the television until my bedtime at    
 9.00.                                 
                                       
                                       </content>
