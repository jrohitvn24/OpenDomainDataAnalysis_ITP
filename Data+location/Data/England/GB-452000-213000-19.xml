		<content>We came to Islip 20 years ago,when I   
first started teaching after leaving   
the army,at the age of 45.There are six
of us in the family,but our older three
children are now all married with their
own children,and live away.Only my wife
and I and our youngest son are at      
home.I am the headteacher of Dr South's
School,my wife works as secretary in a 
child cancer research establishment in 
the Old Radcliffe and is a District and
Parish Councillor,and our son is a     
Countryside Assistant with the Oxford  
City Council.Our oldest daughter is a  
social worker,and the younger an       
archaeologist.Both are married to      
teachers in Comprehensive Schools.Our  
older son makes furniture in Devon.    
Until we came to Islip we had lived    
most of our lives in the Far East where
I was with the Gurkhas and my wife was 
a Ceylon tea planter's daughter.       </content>
