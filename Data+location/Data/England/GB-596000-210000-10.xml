		<title>10Tollesbury Industrial Area.</title>
		<content> In Tollesbury we have a small         
 Industrial area.   It varies from     
 eletronics works to light engineering.
   There are two electric companys one 
 telephones and radios.   There are    
 also five boat builders,a crash       
 repair garage,an engineering company  
 and a rubber company, all of the      
 factories grouped together, and no one
 can go further than the marina because
 of the River Blackwater.   The boat   
 building is most popular because of   
 the river which is good for sailing   
 on.   Boats are displayed outside with
 their prices on, you could if you     
 wanted, have a boat especially built  
 for you and  your needs.   Here are   
 the names of some of the companies:_  
 Sound Power Telephones, Gamart, Wilks 
 Rubberplastics, Nixons.
