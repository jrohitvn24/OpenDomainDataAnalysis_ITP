		<title>04Childrens Strike</title>
		<content> In May this year pupils of our school 
 became involved in a strike. It was   
 organised by a youth trade union      
 movement to complain about being      
 forced to go on a Youth Training      
 Sceme. Because our school became one  
 of the first to take part we were     
 mentioned in the national press . It  
 seemed funny seeing our school name in
 the papers. A few hundred children    
 from Kirkby took part in the strike,  
 though a lot of them did not really   
 know why they went out. Some thought  
 it was a complaint about school       
 dinners! Unfortunately, some only went
 on strike because they were frightened
 by what there friends would say if    
 they didn't.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
