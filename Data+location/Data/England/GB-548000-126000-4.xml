		<content> One result of the ban on new housing  
 is that enterprising people have      
 bought available property and         
 converted it often on a do-it-yourself
 basis. There is a converted Oast house
 and some old stone farm labourers'    
 cottages have been extended or        
 combined to make one larger house out 
 of two small ones. In other cases     
 larger houses have been divided to    
 give two or three separate units. One 
 of the more ambitious projects is the 
 conversion of a granary done by the   
 owner almost single-handed over a     
 period of years. Within the past l2   
 months the former village shop has    
 become a home because when the        
 previous owner and shopkeeper retired 
 no-one could be found to continue to  
 run the business. The village is now  
 without a shop to the regret of many  
 residents.                            </content>
