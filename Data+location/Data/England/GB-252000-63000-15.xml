		<title>15Animal Welfare on Dartmoor.</title>
		<content> Long ago in 1911 animals were not     
 treated very well.People could be     
 cruel to animals but nothing would be 
 done,but now if somebody is cruel they
 would be prosecuted.Today it is not   
 illegal to hunt animals with dogs,but 
 it probably will be one day.It is     
 illegal to kill or be cruel to{Badgers
 and to set traps for certain other    
 animals.Now if an animal has a broken 
 leg and it is reported to the {       
{R.S.P.C.A.}they will probably come to 
 the case straight away.If it is not   
 very serious the{Royal Society for    
{Prevention of Cruelty to Animals}will 
 contact the owner of the animal.At the
 moment animals like mink or otter are 
 quite rare because people have hunted 
 them for a long time.
