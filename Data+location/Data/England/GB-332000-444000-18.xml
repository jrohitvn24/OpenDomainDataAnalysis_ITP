		<title>18SUNDAYS IN FLEETWOOD</title>
		<content> On Sundays I rise at 7.30 a.m. I wake 
 my brother and we go down for         
 breakfast which consists of cornflakes
 toast &amp; butter and coffee.  We must   
 then tidy up and wash the breakfast   
 pots. When this is finished we get    
 ready for Church, Mass starts at 10.00
 a.m. and finishes at approximately    
 11.00 a.m. When we return I tidy my   
 room which is usually very messy.     
 After this we go for a ride in the    
 country which I enjoy because I like  
 to see the wildlife, I especially like
 rabbits.Occasionally we stop for lunch
 at a restaurant called "Carriages" in 
 Blackpool. At about 2.30 p.m. we visit
 my grandmother for coffee. We usually 
 have a quiet night indoors while my   
 Dad goes to the pub for a drink.Before
 bed we usually watch television and   
 have a quick drink of hot chocolate.
