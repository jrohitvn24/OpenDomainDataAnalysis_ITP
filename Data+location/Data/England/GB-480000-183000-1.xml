		<title>01THE THAMES VALLEY</title>
		<content>     This section of the Thames Valley 
 consists of flood plains rising to    
 mixed woodland.In an area of          
 outstanding beauty it contains the    
 river side villages of Hurley and     
 Medmenham.Both villages were mentioned
 in the Domesday Book.                 
   Three of the large historic houses  
 in the area are now used as offices.  
   Land previously used for farming is 
 now used for recreational pursuits    
 -pheasant shooting, horse riding and  
 caravanning.                          
   Farming is to a large extent now in 
 the hands of farming syndicates.Dairy 
 produce is very common.               
   There is much evidence of a wide    
 variety of wild life.
