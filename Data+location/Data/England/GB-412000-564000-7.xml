		<title>07THE DAY OF A JUNIOR CHILD.</title>
		<content>     I am 9 years old. I go to Ryton   
 Juniors. I come to school by car. The 
 whistle goes and we go into lines.    
 Each class contains 25 or 28 people.  
 We have register. On Mondays we go    
 straight to the baths.                
    After assembly we usually have     
 maths. We have Scottish Maths.        
 Breaktime is 10.40. We play marbles   
 and adventure games.                  
    After break we have English.       
 Sometimes we do dictionary exercises. 
    At 12.00 we have dinner. We have a 
 choice - turkey curry, chips and rice 
 with chocolate cake for pudding.      
    After lunch we do R.E. and art or  
 history and geography. Sometimes we   
 use the computer for serious things.  
    We have our break at 2.30, then    
 sometimes we have P.E. We put our     
 trays away and say "Goodnight". On the
 way home I watch marbles and fights.  </content>
