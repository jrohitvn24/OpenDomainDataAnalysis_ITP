		<content> Stainforth received its market        
 charter in (1346/1348). The village   
 grew up around the market area        
 alongside the River Don. Sheffield and
 South Yorkshire canal runs through the
 village and was the centre of activity
 before the mine was sunk in 1916.     
 Trains travelled down Princess Avenue 
 between the pit and the canal,where   
 barges would remove or deliver the    
 goods. Nowadays canal traffic is      
 mostly for leisure. A disco boat comes
 once a year in the summer. The        
 greatest change in Stainforth over the
 last seventy years,since the first    
 coal was found ,has to be the vast    
 planned estate of Coal Board housing, 
 which dominates the village. Many     
 older properties can be found along   
 the canal bank.
