		<content> There is one park in the block.It is a
 large flat square of grass with a few 
 newly planted trees in one corner and 
 a small children's play area with     
 swings and slide in the corner.       
 Harvills Hawthorn Junior  and Infant  
 Schools each have very large playing  
 fields and tarmac playgrounds.The     
 playing fields are bordered with a    
 variety of mature trees and a newly   
 planted hawthorn hedge.               
 Off Harvills Hawthorn there is a large
 area of derelict land where a row of  
 terraced houses once stood.           
 Off Bagnall Street there is a derelict
 steel storage depot.                  
 The whole area of land in the northern
 half of the block is derelict.
