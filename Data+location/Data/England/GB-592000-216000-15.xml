		<title>15LAYER BRETON OLD CHURCH</title>
		<content> St. Mary's Anglican Church, Layer     
 Breton stands next to the Heath in the
 main part of the village. It was built
 in 1915. The original church stood    
 opposite Layer Breton Hall. It was    
 demolished in 1913 having deteriorated
 following a shaking received in the   
 earthquake of 1884. A watercolour     
 painting of the old church, which was 
 painted shortly before the demolition,
 hangs in the new church. It shows that
 the old building was of a similar     
 shape and size to the new, having a   
 vestry behind the altar and a wooden  
 porch. It had a wooden bell turret as 
 does the new building. It was of      
 rubble construction with a tiled roof.
 The modern church is of brick         
 construction with tiles. There was a  
 church on the old site from at least  
 Norman times. The old church probably 
 dated from the 14th century.          </content>
