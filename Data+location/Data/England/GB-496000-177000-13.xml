		<title>13ETON COLLEGE</title>
		<content>  We interviewed two Eton College boys.
 We started by asking them if they     
 enjoyed College.They said it was good 
 for the first two or three years and  
 then it got a bit boring.They said    
 Americans loved their uniform and     
 liked to see them wearing it.The boys 
 said that at first they didn't like   
 the collars because they were stiff   
 but they soon got used to them.They   
 don't wear uniform in their leisure   
 time. They have excellent sports      
 facilities.They think the golf course 
 is very good,they have tennis courts, 
 a swimming pool,cricket fields and a  
 good running track.They think the     
 teaching at Eton is very good.On      
 Sundays they may get invited to tea at
 a different house.Their rooms are     
 small but they don't spend much time  
 in them.The boys we talked to are     
 allowed into Windsor,Slough and London</content>
