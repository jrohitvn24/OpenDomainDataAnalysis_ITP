		<title>03THE CHURCH IN LITTONDALE</title>
		<content>  The Church is called St. Oswald's.   
 St. Oswald was the King of            
 Northumbria.  There used to be a      
 church here, thought to be made of    
 wood, in Saxon times.  Nothing remains
 of this wooden church.                
   All that remains from the Norman    
 period are the foundations under the  
 present chancel.  The Tower is all    
 that is left of a 15th Century church.
 Most of the rest of the present       
 building dates from the end of the    
 18th Century.  Early in the 19th      
 Century part of the nave was knocked  
 down so that the chancel could be     
 built.                                
   Two well known Vicars of Arncliffe  
 church in the 19th Century            
 were William Boyd and Cannon Shuffrey.
 There is no resident vicar at         
 Arncliffe now, the Vicar of Kettlewell
 is also Vicar of Arncliffe.           </content>
