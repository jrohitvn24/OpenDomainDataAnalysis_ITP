		<title>13FLOODING IN HELSTON</title>
		<content> Loe Bar is a large shingle feature    
 lying across the mouth of the River   
 Cober. Behind the shingle bar lies the
 largest natural freshwater lake in    
 Cornwall. It lies to the south of the 
 town of Helston.                      
     To allow water to escape from Loe 
 Pool a tunnel was constructed along   
 the line of an old mine adit.         
     During heavy winter storms in     
 Novenber 1984 this outlet to the sea  
 became blocked causing a build up of  
 water in the lake behind the bar. This
 caused the lower part of Helston town 
 to be flooded. On Wednesday 5th       
 December, mechanical diggers were     
 moved onto the bar to dig a large     
 trench so that water could flow to the
 sea and relieve the flooding. Although
 the trench was later blocked it now,  
 unfortunately, forms a large feature  
 in the bar.                           </content>
