		<title>12THORNBURY CASTLE</title>
		<content> In 1510 the{Duke of Buckingham        
 received permission from{Henry V111}  
 to fortify and crenellate Thornbury   
 Manor. Ten yers later he was executed 
 for treason and his castle and lands  
 were  confiscated by the King.        
                                       
 Henry stayed with{Anne Boleyn}at the  
 castle for a few days and later{Mary  
{Tudor}lived there for several years   
 before becoming Queen. At this time   
 the castle was returned to the Duke of
 Buckingham's descendants,the Howards. 
 It is said that the Duke's headless   
 ghost still haunts the buildings.     
                                       
 In 1966{Mr.K.Bell}bought and converted
 the castle into a 1st class restaurant
 and hotel with two dining rooms and 12
 bedrooms. He has been responsible for 
 the planting of 1,800 vines from which
 the castle produces its own wine.     </content>
