  On the 2nd of July about ten children
 and two adults went into the village  
 of Haxby.We were there to gather      
 information for the Domesday Project  
 by asking questions of the people in  
 the village.                          
  We asked some questions on whether or
 not people would like Haxby Railway   
 Station to be reopened.Twenty -eight  
 people said they would like it to be  
 reopened. However only two people said
 they would use it every day, but      
 seventeen said they would use it every
 week.                                 
  I told my Dad the results of our     
 survey because he works for British   
 Rail. He said that it had nothing at  
 all to do with British Rail, the      
 Council have to decide what to do.
