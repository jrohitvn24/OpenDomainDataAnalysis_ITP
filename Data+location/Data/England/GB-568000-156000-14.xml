		<title>14E.Malling (Kent) for Fruit</title>
		<content> Kent is the most important fruit -    
 growing county in England. Fruit      
 farmers, needing somewhere to turn to 
 for help and advice, were responsible,
 with the help of Wye College, for     
 setting up E.M.R.S (East Malling      
 Research Station) on 23 acres of land 
 at E.Malling in 1913. This location   
 was chosen for several reasons. It is 
 near the centre of the main fruit     
 growing area of Britain. The deep,    
 good loam soil is suitable for fruit  
 growing - it holds water but drains   
 well in wet weather. Initially the    
 nearby railway was important, linking 
 the Research Station, Wye and London. 
 The useful work carried out in the    
 early days attracted financial support
 from growers and the government.      
 Nearby Bradbourne House with its 360  
 fertile acres was acquired in 1938.
