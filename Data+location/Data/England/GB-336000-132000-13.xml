		<title>13Wild Mammals</title>
		<content> The wild mammals found in the area are
 water voles and water shrews, which   
 are declining in numbers and brown    
 rats and mink which are increasing.   
 There are plenty of foxes and roe deer
 and even badgers which do not normally
 like such a wet environment.          
 The meadows are ideal for butterflies,
 the most common of which are marbled  
 white (rare in most other parts of    
 England), small copper, common blue,  
 and orange tip.                       
 Dragonflies and damselflies find the  
 rhynes to be most suitable breeding   
 grounds, but there are fears that     
 changes in rhyne management and water 
 pollution from fertilisers and        
 drainage pose threats to them.        
 There are also many different species,
 including very rare ones, of water    
 beetles, crickets and grasshoppers.
