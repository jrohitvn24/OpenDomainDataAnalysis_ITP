		<title>12UPTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Upton village lies on the extreme     
 southern edge of the area. There is a 
 church, a methodist chapel, a garage  
 and the only shop in all the area of  
 the Brendon Hills that we surveyed.   
 The old part of the village has some  
 lovely stone houses which are very    
 well cared for and there are also some
 large new bungolows being built on    
 the main road (B 3190).               
 The garage has petrol (at Â£2.04 a     
 gallon when we were there) and also   
 does repairs but there were no cars   
 for sale there. The man who built the 
 garage used to live in the house which
 now houses the local Post Office      
 and villge shop.                      
 The man who serves petrol at the      
 garage does not live in the village   
 but travels there from Bampton every  
 day, about six miles.
