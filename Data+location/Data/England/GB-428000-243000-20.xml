		<content> The Underhill family were connected   
 with both Oxhill and Idlicote from    
 1450 to 1667.Whatcote was called      
 Quatecote at one time but the modern  
 name is supposed to be derived from   
 the Whattle and Daub construction of  
 the original cottages.It lies on a    
 long straight road of at least Roman  
 origin.It had the reputation of being 
 the poorest village,but the church has
 Norman features.                      
 The public house is reputed to have   
 been built as the ale house for the   
 church builders in Norman times and it
 was there that{Oliver Cromwell}stayed 
 before the {Battle of Edgehill.}Oxhill
 was mainly for the{Roundheads}although
 some local families fought for the    
{Royalist Cause}under Lord Compton.    
 Some land in Whatcote is still owned  
 by the Marquis of Northhampton.
