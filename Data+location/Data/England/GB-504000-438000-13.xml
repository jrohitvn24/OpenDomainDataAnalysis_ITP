		<content> Some children from St. Nicholas C.P.  
 school interviewed Mrs. Barnard aged  
 80 years old.  She has lived in this  
 area for many years and previously    
 taught at the school.                 
      Her recollections of life and    
 information passed on to her from     
 colleagues was fascinating. For       
 instance the three largest sources of 
 employment are no longer              
 available.They were the glue works,the
 barges and the shipyard.              
      Work at the glue works was hard  
 and dirty,and it was a glue process   
 which caused the obnoxious smell which
 pervaded the air. Mrs. Barnard        
 recalled that during her teaching     
 career there were many occasions when 
 the stench was so appalling that the  
 headteacher was obliged to ask the    
 factory manager to close the doors in 
 an effort to curb the smell.          </content>
