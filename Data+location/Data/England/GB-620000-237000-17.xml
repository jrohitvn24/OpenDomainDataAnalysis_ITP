		<content> We begin this school when we are      
nearly five and leave after eleven. We 
have four classrooms for different     
ages,each with its own teacher. Our    
lessons begin at 9 o'clock. They are   
quite normal like Mathematics,History, 
Geography, Computers, Art, Topic,      
Science, English, Music and Games. We  
do not always work in the classroom,   
sometimes we work in the practical     
area, and sometimes we work outside.   
Sometimes we work with partners and in 
groups. Some of us like to take our    
work home. We have a lot of equipment  
to help us, like television, video,    
cassette recorders and projectors. We  
join other schools for P.E. activities 
and Musical Performances. In Summer we 
visit the local High School to swim. At
lunch-time we have Clubs for Athletics,
Table-tennis, Football,Netball,Choir,  
Recorders and Country-dancing.         </content>
