 My house is a semi-detached four      
 bedroomed house. It has three floors, 
 a separate bathroom and toilet. It has
 a front garden that is 15ft. by 12ft. 
 The back garden is 100ft. by 20ft. The
 house also has a dining room, alounge 
 and a kitchen.

 My house is a little old workman's    
 terraced cottage. Built in 1888, it   
 has a tiny garden. The original       
 kitchen was so small that the outside 
 fuel room and outside toilet were used
 to enlarge the kitchen.There are two  
 living rooms. My bedroom and my       
 mother's bedroom have four ceilings:- 
 one of polystyrene tiles,a war        
 ceiling, another ceiling and the loft 
 floor. The stairs are steep. In a new 
 house they would be illegal.          </content>
