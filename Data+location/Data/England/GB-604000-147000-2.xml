		<content> There are no special craft centres    
 in this area but a number of women in 
 the district belong to their nearest  
 Womens' Institute  where they learn   
 many arts and crafts such as dying,   
 weaving lambs and sheep wool which    
 they knit into all sorts of garments. 
 They crochet, make pottery, do silver 
 and pewter work, sewing and           
 embroidery.  Chestnut trees are grown 
 and cut down about every fifteen years
 to make spile fencing.                
 A few people paint and draw for       
 pleasure, some in their own homes and 
 others in groups or singly in the     
 countryside.
