		<content>  Mr.Thomas is a pensioner.He lives    
 with his wife in a semi-detatched     
 house in Roud.He was born in Lambeth, 
 London and he came to the Island 30   
 years ago in 1955.He has lived in his 
 present house for 29 years.           
  Mr.Thomas says,"...there has been no 
 major changes in Roud and Chale Green 
 execpt for the new estate in Chale    
 Green." He also determines that       
 although there are no special         
 facilities,Roud is a lovely area for a
 child to grow up in because of the    
 beautiful countryside.                
  When we asked Mr.Thomas whether he   
 believed in conservation,he           
 replied,"Well,most of the time I      
 do,but not always."
