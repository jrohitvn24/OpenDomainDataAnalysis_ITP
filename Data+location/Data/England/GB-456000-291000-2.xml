   Willoughby lies in the county of    
 Leicestershire and is situated 10     
 miles away from the city of Leicester.
   There has been a village at         
 Willoughby since before 1066 as it    
 features in The Domesday Book under   
 the name of Wilechebi .Willoughby was 
 originally called Wilebi which means  
 the homestead among the Willows by the
 water meadows.It was thus named       
 because of the many springs that lay  
 near the surface and the two rivulets 
 that ran through the village.         
   Today Willoughby Waterleys is a     
 small agricultural village where mass 
 modern development has been avoided.  
 It comprises of farming and           
 residential property with few         
 facilities.This stucture helps to     
 retain the peaceful and rural nature  
 of Willoughby Waterleys.              </content>
