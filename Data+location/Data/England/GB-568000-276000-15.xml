		<title>15 The Egg Farm</title>
		<content> One farmer in Hollywell Row who is    
also a Councillor,has 16,000 laying    
hens that average 75% laying eggs.All  
eggs are sold locally from Cambridge to
Thetford and Bury St.Edmunds.He has 200
acres on which he grows most of the    
crops listed in the {farming} section. 
Beekeepers use his fields of oil seed  
rape for producing honey and as the    
crop has to be sprayed several times,  
he warns all beekeepers in the area and
they keep their bees shut up in their  
hives on spraying days. Sugar beet is  
harvested at 25 tons to the acre and   
this produces 2 tons of sugar,and the  
cereal crops can now  produce four tons
an acre. 3 men and 1 part time lady are
employed on the farm.                  
 As a lifetime resident,the biggest    
changes noticed have been created by   
the Airfield,Greater London Council    
Overspill scheme and farming progress. </content>
