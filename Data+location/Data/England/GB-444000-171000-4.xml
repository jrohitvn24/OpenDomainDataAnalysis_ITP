		<title>04ECOLOGY (COUNTRY PARK ONE)</title>
		<content> The greater part of Snelsmore common  
 consists of a plateau 450ft above sea 
 level and the common covers 120 acres 
 of land owned by three different Lords
 of the Manor.With its clay base and   
 overlying gravel the soil is rather   
 infertile so birch is very prevalent  
 along with heather and ferns.Most of  
 the common is woodland but there is a 
 conservation area of valley bogland in
 which it is dangerous to set foot.    
 Wildlife varies from deer and fox     
 to lizards and adders.Woodpeckers,    
 warblers,nightjars and nuthatch are   
 seen.                                 
 The Country Park was only established 
 after 1970 as a result of Shell       
 National Consevation Competition won  
 by the girls of Newbury Girls Grammer 
 School.Concrete routes and parking    
 areas already existed.The common was  
 used as a transport depot in W.War 2. </content>
