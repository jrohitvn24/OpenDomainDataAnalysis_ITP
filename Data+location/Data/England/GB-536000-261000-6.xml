		<content>    Recently the Dry Drayton Parish    
 Council stopped The Drift being made  
 up into a proper asphalt pathway.We   
 were also told that the Parish Council
 would fight "tooth and nail"to stop a 
 road being put through as the people  
 feel that a road or even  a proper    
 pathway through to Bar Hill could be  
 the beginning of the end of Dry       
 Drayton as a  separate village or,at  
 least,the end of it as  a village     
 with its own identity.
