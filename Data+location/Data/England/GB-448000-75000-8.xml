		<content> St.Catherine's Lighthouse,situated at 
 the most southerly point of the I.W., 
 is scheduled as being of special arch-
 itectural/historical interest.The     
 tower(25m)is octagonal,with a fog     
 signal tower adjoining the south      
 face,also octagonal in shape.Both     
 towers have a castellated parapet and 
 are white in colour.These towers are  
 expressively referred to by local in- 
 habitants as'The Cow and the Calf'.In 
 addition to the main navigation light 
 is a subsidiary light,which is used as
 a hazard warning and marker for the   
 notorious Atherfield Ledge,WNW of the 
 Lt/Ho.The fog signal consists of two  
 vertical banks of four horns and gives
 one 3-second blast every 45 seconds.  
 The Lt/Ho.also houses monitoring      
 equipment for the Large Automatic     
 Navigation Buoy(Lanby),at the Owers   
 Station which is 24 miles to the East.</content>
