		<title>08My Modern House by Faye</title>
		<content>   My house in Halling is a modern     
 house built in 1982.It is mostly grey 
 and white in colour.The grey part is  
 the roof.It has four bedrooms,a       
 bathroom with a toilet,a shower-room  
 with a toilet and a single toilet down
 stairs.We also have a utility room, a 
 kitchen,a dining-room and a living-   
 room.The loft entry is in my sister's 
 bed-room and inside the loft is a     
 great big empty space.                
   My garden is also huge.The flowers  
 are beginning to grow in it.We have   
 a nice big garage so we can store     
 things.There is also storage-room     
 under the cupboards in the kitchen.The
 lounge is quite big and there are     
 beams nearly every-where.             
   There are new houses being built    
 in Halling and some families have     
 already moved into Britannia Close,a  
 new development on the High Street.   </content>
