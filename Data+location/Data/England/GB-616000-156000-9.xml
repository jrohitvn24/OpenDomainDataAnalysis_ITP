		<title>09THE QUEEN'S REGIMENT</title>
		<content>         A Soldier's Day               
 Close to the Geoffrey Chaucer School  
 is the HQ.of the Queen's Regiment.  We
 interviewed soldiers from this        
 regiment in order to discover what    
 life was like for those who lived and 
 worked here.                          
 The aspect of a soldier's career that 
 takes up most of his working day is   
 training. This starts after breakfast 
 at 8.00am and continues until early   
 evening . Fitness and skills are      
 monitored by a physical training      
 instructor who gradually builds up the
 training schedule.  Some experienced  
 soldiers might run 10-20 miles per    
 day.  When training a soldier could   
 carry up to 35lbs of equipment. On    
 occasions this weight might be        
 increased to as much as 120lbs to     
 simulate conditions during the        
 Falklands crisis.                     </content>
