		<title>14A day in my life - Hannah</title>
		<content> It is the end of a wet week at{Pilton 
{Pop Festival. }Everyone packed their  
 bags to go.  Away from the mud, to    
 beautiful sunshine and lush green     
 grass. No-one would guess that there  
 had once been grass at Worthy Farm;   
 now there was only mud: sloppy,       
 sticky and mushy.  Driving out the    
 wheels spun , spitting mud everywhere.
 The roads were sloshy, though they    
 began to dry and now six miles away   
 everything was dry, green and perfect.
 The sun was high in the sky, and was a
 wonderful orangey- yellow.  We walked 
 into our garden and were met by       
 trillions of flowers, beautiful       
 outbursts of colour. My brother and I 
 dumped everythingand ran outside to   
 make sunbeds, they were amazingly     
 soft, and it seemed like paradise     
 lying there sipping fruit juice.
