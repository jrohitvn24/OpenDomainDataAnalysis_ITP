		<title>19The Lifeboat</title>
		<content> The Clovelly Lifeboat "City of        
 Bristol" is moored approx. 1/4 mile   
 offshore, but goes to Lundy for       
 shelter in bad weather.She is one of  
 the largest of the Royal National     
 Lifeboat Institution's fleet, financed
 entirely voluntarily. An R.N.L.I.     
 station to cover the Western          
 approaches of the Bristol Channel was 
 first opened at Clovelly in 1870. The 
 boat is 70 ft. long and is the 3rd. of
 the "Clyde" class to be built - hence 
 its number 70-003. Unlike other       
 lifeboats it is permanently manned by 
 2 crews of coxwain, mechanic, and 3   
 deckhands, who live and sleep on board
 for alternate fortnights, ready to    
 respond immediately to any calls of   
 distress at sea.                      
  Financial constraints now make the   
 boat's future uncertain.
