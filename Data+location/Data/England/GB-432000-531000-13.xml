		<title>13BISHOP MIDDLEHAM FETE</title>
		<content> Each year in July, the village has    
 its Parish Fete. This is now held on  
 the school field to accommodate more  
 stalls and people, but previously it  
 was a modest affair held on the       
 vicarage lawn.                        
                                       
 It is essentially a money raising     
 event organised by the Parochial      
 Church Council and includes stalls and
 games with entertainment being        
 provided by bands and the             
 schoolchildren who sing or dance.     
                                       
 The fete normally opens with a fancy  
 dress parade and judging. The stalls  
 have raffles, games, home baked cakes 
 and jams, plants and other items that 
 have been donated by the villagers for
 sale. Last year the fete raised about 
 Â£1000.                                
                                       </content>
