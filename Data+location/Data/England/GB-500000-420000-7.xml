		<title>07THE SURGERY</title>
		<content> Barton has one{surgery}and this is    
 where people go for treatment.There   
 are eight doctors in the{practice,}6  
 are there all the time and 2 who are  
 part-time.Our local{doctor}works from 
 8.30 a.m.-7.30 p.m.Doctors get one    
 weekend off in three.One doctor sees  
 46 patients in an average day and the 
 whole surgery gets 500{patients}a day.
 The doctors not only see patients in  
 Barton but they travel to other local 
 villages.This way they meet lots of   
 patients who would not get to the     
 surgery.                              
  Patients who need special treatment  
 and cannot be treated at the surgery  
 are sent to Hull Royal Infirmary or   
 Scunthorpe General Hospital.Sometimes 
 Hull's hospital holds clinics at the  
 surgery so they can examine the same  
 medical problems.The most common      
 illnesses are coughs and colds.       </content>
