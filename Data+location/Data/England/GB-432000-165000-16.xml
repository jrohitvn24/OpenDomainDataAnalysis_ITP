		<content> In the eightees,more married women go 
 out to work. More possess freezers,   
 microwave cookers, food processors or 
 mixers and together with the "conven- 
 ience" foods, e.g. frozen beefburgers,
 fish fingers, tinned food, these make 
 for speedier production of meals. Also
 easily available are washing          
 machines,tumble dryers and vacuum     
 cleaners which reduce the time        
 required for house work,              
 More homes have colour televisions and
 video recorders and rely on these more
 for entertainment.These days a typical
 Saturday evening often consists of a  
 hired video film and a take-away meal 
 from a Chinese/Indian/fish/chip shop. 
 Home computer games are most popular. 
 "Second" cars are owned by more       
 people,which means wives are more     
 mobile and children easily taken to   
 and from school by car.               </content>
