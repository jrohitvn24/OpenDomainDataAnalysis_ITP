  Workington M.P.Dale Campbell-Savours}
 has claimed that whole industrial     
 estates have been laid bare in West   
 Cumbria.In a scathing attack on the   
 Government,he claimed:                
         "All round my constituency    
 there are factories that have been    
 emptied over the last 5 years.        
 Industrialists have over these last   
 5 years in the Northern Region, and   
 particularly in Workington,had what   
 can only be described as a hell of a  
 time".                                
 Council Labour Group leader Hugh      
 Little said:                          
           "Unemployment has increased 
 and job opportunities have decreased. 
 Unemployment is as near to 20 per cent
 as makes no difference in Workington  
 ."
