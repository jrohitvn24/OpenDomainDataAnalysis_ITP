		<title>02Corston - Traffic</title>
		<content> The village of{Corston}is situated on 
 a busy main road,the A 429 from       
 Chippenham to Cirencester.We conducted
 a{traffic survey}between 10-11 am on  
 Thurs.11th July.Friday,market day in  
{Chippenham,}is the busiest day of the 
 week.The results were as follows:-Cars
  184;motor cycles 3; bicycles         
 1;lorries 38;vans 44; buses 2.Looking 
 at the registrations we discovered    
 that most of the vehicles came from   
 Wiltshire and the surrounding areas   
 like Bristol, Gloucestershire and     
 Somerset.One car was from Ireland.The 
 road is quite twisty through the      
 village,and there is a speed limit of 
 40 m.p.h.The bridge over the river    
 used to be quite dangerous,until it   
 was improved recently.We were told    
 that the improvements to the bridge   
 were speeded up because the local     
 M.P.drove into it.                    </content>
