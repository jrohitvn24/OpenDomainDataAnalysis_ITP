		<title>11All Saints Church,Lt. Kimble</title>
		<content>  The Church is 700 years old and built
medieval period, it is famous for its  
wall paintings for which the Kimble    
parochial curch council are the        
trustees. It's likely that the walls   
were coverd with paintings of saints   
including St. Laurence, St. Francis,   
St. George and St. Bernard who is not  
normaly heard of in England. The Church
is set in a lovely rural setting in the
Chiltern hills. It also has a tower    
with two bells. There is a painting of 
St. George and the Princess. The       
paintings in the Church were not just  
made for decoration but for learning as
well because most people in the        
Medieval period could not read. All    
Saints is made from flint. Rev. David  
Horner is now the rector of the church.
The bell tower is 7-8 metres high.
