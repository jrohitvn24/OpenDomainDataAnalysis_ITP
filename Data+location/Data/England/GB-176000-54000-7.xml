		<title>07Saving our Dunes - Project</title>
		<content> We went to the dunes to plant marram  
 grass with Mr.Lewis.We left school at 
 1.25pm.We walked in pairs down the    
 track and along by the Mobil Garage.  
 Then we met Mr.Lewis by the life guard
 hut.He had a land rover.We asked him  
 many questions.We are planting because
 the dunes are receding and the blown  
 sand is causing problems in the       
 village.When there is no grass the    
 sand blows away.This community project
 has been going for five years.The MSC 
 are helping to move the marram grass  
 from the top of the dunes.It is one of
 the few plants which grows in sand.   
 They have very long roots of up to 15m
 in length.The leaves curl when it is  
 hot to trap the moisture and make it  
 run down to the roots.You use a       
 special spade and work in pairs.A West
 Briton photographer took photos of us.
 We were in the local newspaper.       </content>
