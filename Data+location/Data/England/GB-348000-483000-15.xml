		<title>15LEVENS HALL</title>
		<content> Levens Hall is the Cumbria home of Hal
 and Susan Bagot.                      
 The house is divided into three main  
 periods: the first when the de Redman 
 family built the pele tower and hall  
 about l250 - l300: the second about   
 l570 - 90 when the next family, the   
 Bellinghams, cousins of the de Redmans
 made the grim medieval shell into a   
 gentleman's residence; and lastly when
 Colonel James Grahme, first cousin of 
 the last Bellingham, finished the     
 house with his exquisite taste about  
 l680.                                 
 The rooms of the house have been kept 
 as near to the orginal as possible    
 with furniture, drapes, carpets and   
 utensils dating back over many years. 
 The grounds and gardens, particularly 
 the topiary which was started in l692,
 are a significant feature of the      
 property.                             </content>
