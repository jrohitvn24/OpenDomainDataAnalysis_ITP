		<title>03LIVING IN WILMSLOW.</title>
		<content>  We interviewed two residents of      
 Wilmslow about what it is like to live
 here. Their viewpoints are quite      
 different.                            
    Mrs Travis,an  elderly lady has    
 lived in Wilmslow all her life.She    
 thought Wilmslow is not as nice as it 
 was.There is a lot of money in        
 Wilmslow now and it's not as friendly 
 any more.Mrs Travis thought that      
 Wilmslow has changed a lot as there   
 are different people,more shops and   
 many more vehicles.                   
  Mrs Willard,an American, has just    
 moved to England.She was apprehensive 
 when she first came, but was happy to 
 come to  England.She says  we talk    
 funny but people have gone out of     
 their way to be friendly. She thinks  
 Wilmslow is very convenient but it is 
 hard to park the car when out         
 shopping.                             </content>
