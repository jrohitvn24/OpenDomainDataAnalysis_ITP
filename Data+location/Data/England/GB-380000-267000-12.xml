		<title>12Winnall Caravan Park.</title>
		<content> The Winnall Caravan Park began during 
 the war when the refugees came to get 
 away from the bombing in the cities.  
 The oldest part of the caravan park is
 the Georgian house which belonged to  
 the squire in the year 1735.          
 Now the family living in the house    
 only  use half of it as rather big.   
 Opposite the house there is an old    
 barn which used to be on the York to  
 London run where the horses were      
 exchanged before crossing the river by
 ferry.The surrounding is grazing land 
 with various trees such as ash,beech, 
 sycamore and birch.They were mostly   
 planted by the campsite.The fields are
 used for potatoes,wheat and sugarbeet.
 The campsite provides activities such 
 as a club and a fishery.
