		<title>09WILLEY PARK FARM CHALDON</title>
		<content>    The farm has 197 acres, 32 acres   
 winter wheat, 50 barley and 110 grass,
 mainly for silage. In the winter Mr.  
 Blatts grazes sheep from Romney Marsh.
 He has 20 sheep of his own. He raises 
 cattle, few at present, but intends to
 raise more in the future. They have   
 geese, ducks, chickens and a llama.   
                                       
    The oldest building is the house,  
 it dates from 1665. The water tower is
 150 years old. The silage tower is    
 newer.                                
                                       
    Neville Blatts has been at the farm
 8 years. He was born in Zimbabwe. His 
 wife was born in England, so were his 
 children.                             
                                       
    His worst problem is uncontrolled  
 dogs. Sixteen sheep were killed, and  
 three dogs were put down in 1984.     </content>
