		<title>18LIVESTOCK/PETS IN CLATFORD</title>
		<content> Having done a study of the {PETS }kept
 by children of Clatford School we     
 discovered that out of 158 children   
 84% keep pets.Of these pets fish are  
 the most common followed by chicken   
 and cats.Only two children keep       
 unusual pets,these are watersnakes and
 ferrets.Children are encouraged to    
 take care of their pets themselves but
 often it falls to the parents to      
 undertake to look after them.Clatford 
 School's pets are fish which Class 1  
 keep.Two older children clean them out
 weekly.The fish are fed daily by      
 children in Class 1.                  
    We did a study of {FARMING}in our  
 area.Cowdown farmhouse keeps Pedigree 
 Guernsey {COWS},50 in milk and the    
 rest are in various stages of         
 development...calves,heifers and bulls
 used for breeding.Westover farm keeps 
 no {LIVESTOCK}at all.                 </content>
