		<title>13HARVEST FESTIVAL IN NEWTON.</title>
		<content> The bells pealed joyously to bring us 
 to the evening Harvest Festival this  
 year.It was the first time that these 
 5 bells had been rung for a service   
 for 40 years.With a keen group of     
 learner ringers it is hoped to peal   
 them more freqently in future.Flowers 
 and harvest produce had been used to  
 decorate the church by the women of   
 the village and the men had given     
 assistance when ladders were needed.  
 The great thanksgiving hymns rolled   
 out from a full village congregation. 
 After the service there was another   
 innovation this year;a harvest supper 
 in one of the village homes with food 
 contributed by several different      
 people.All the harvest produce was    
 sold in aid of a Tanzanian hospital.  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
