 The village of Winston lies north of  
 the River Tees, on the main route from
 Darlington to Barnard Castle.  It is  
 best described as a commuter village, 
 due to the absence of local industry. 
 The village had, until recently, been 
 spared from expansion by residential  
 developments, normally associated with
 rural areas.  Recent building at the  
 west end of the village (Highcliff    
 Edge Estate) is of high quality, high 
 cost properties occupied by families  
 with two or three children.           
                                       
 At the west and historic end of the   
 village, development has been to      
 quality development of bunglows, and  
 the altration of farm buuldings into  
 separate residences.  One notable     
 aspect with all the recent            
 construction is the use of stone.     </content>
