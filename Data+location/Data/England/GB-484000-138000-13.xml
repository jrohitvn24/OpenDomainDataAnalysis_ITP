		<content> HOUSING.                              
 Most people in the area own their own 
 homes;the majority of those who have  
 been living in council houses are now 
 buying them.New houses built in the   
 area during the last twelve years have
 been high quality executive type      
 houses.There are no flats and  few    
 bungalows.Owing to the high cost of   
 land,and the popularity of the  area, 
 houses are extremely expensive and    
 rates are high.                       
 Older-type houses,some of them former 
 farm labourers cottages,are sought    
 after by people who wish to modernise 
 and even enlarge them while living in 
 them.                                 
 Planning permission for building new  
 houses is difficult to come by because
 the area falls in the Green Belt,where
 intensity of housing is kept low.No   
 new council houses have been built.   </content>
