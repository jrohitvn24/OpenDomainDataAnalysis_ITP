 Following a fire several years ago at 
 a large garage in the village, then   
 used to produce glass-fibre cabs for  
 milk floats, the site became available
 for redevelopment. A design for a     
 number of small light industrial units
 was approved by the Local Authority   
 and this has, most successfully, been 
 recently completed by a building firm 
 in the village.                       
                                       
 This has produced much needed local   
 employment with some people commuting 
 into the village each day, while the  
 majority of inhabitants still travel  
 outwards, many as far as London by    
 British Rail to Waterloo Station.
