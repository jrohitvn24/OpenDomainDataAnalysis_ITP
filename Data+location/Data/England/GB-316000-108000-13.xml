		<title>13SMEATHARPE - EDUCATION</title>
		<content> Smeatharpe Village School was built in
 1871 by Lord Sidmouth when part of the
 village belonged to his estate. It was
 closed due to falling numbers of      
 children in the 196Os and now is a    
 house.                                
 To-day, local children from the age of
 3 to 5 can attend the Rainbow Play-   
 group in Upottery, twice weekly. From 
 the age of 5 to 11 most children go to
 Upottery County Primary School and    
 afterwards continue secondary educ-   
 ation at Honiton Community College.   
 Here they can take O and A level exam-
 inations. Parents also have the choice
 of other state or private schools.    
 Of the 26 children in Smeatharpe, 1   
 child goes to the Playgroup; l to     
 Churchstanton Primary; 12 to Upottery 
 Primary; 1 to Queen's College,Taunton,
 (private secondary school); and 11 to 
 Honiton Community College.            </content>
