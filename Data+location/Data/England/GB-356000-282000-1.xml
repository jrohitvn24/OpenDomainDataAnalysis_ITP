		<content> Another section of escarpment, low in 
 the south but rising up to clee burf, 
 Brown Clee Hill, at just ander 500m   
 and generally undulating.  The streams
 flow to West and South; the former is 
 by Clee Brook and the latter by       
 Ledwyeke and, tributary, bockletton   
 brooks. the opposite headwaters are   
 within a mile of each other. the two  
 valleys provide suitable sites at     
 about 200m above sea level for two    
 villages, clee St Margaret and Stoke  
 st Milborough. The latter is the      
 larger, with some restoration building
 taking place at the present.  Clee St 
 Margareet has no shop and only a few  
 cottages, houses farms and a church.  
 Elsewhere there is a seatter of a few 
 farms and cottages, the sarp common   
 land being popular.  Much of the      
 older, original property is of the    
 local, dull-red sandstone.            </content>
