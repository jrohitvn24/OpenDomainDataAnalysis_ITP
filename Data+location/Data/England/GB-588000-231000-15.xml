		<title>15Ecology Cricket Bat Willows</title>
		<content>    Last Friday we went on our first   
 trip for "The Domesday Project".We had
 to walk along the roads down into the 
 valley.In the valley there was a      
 stream with trees on either side.The  
 stream was called Cambridge Brook.    
    These trees were cricket bat       
 willows.They are used to make cricket 
 bats because willows grow very fast   
 and so have less grain. The cricket   
 bat is best made from a wood with     
 little grain so that it does not split
 when it is in contact with a hard     
 ball.Willows take fourteen years to   
 grow to a height of 6_8 metres.       
    Willow wood is also suitable for   
 the making of artificial limbs because
 it is so light in weight.             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
