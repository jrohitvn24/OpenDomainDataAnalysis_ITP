 England,and a Methodist.              
 St.John's Church of England is about  
 100 years old,and the present priest  
 in charge is the Rev. Michael         
 Heckingbottom,who also looks after the
 neighbouring Parish of Burton Leonard;

 The Methodist Church was built in 1874

 Rev.B.Marshall,who looks after a large
 city Church in Ripon as well as six   
 village chapels in the Ripon-Masham   
 circuit.There are six retired         
 Ministers in the circuit who visit    
 to preach regularly.                  
 United Services are held quarterly at 
 each church.
