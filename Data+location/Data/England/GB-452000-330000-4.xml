		<title>04HOME LIFE-A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content>  I am Simon Prickett,aged 11.I have   
 one brother and no sisters.This is a  
 typical day in my life.It is 7.30 a.m 
 on a Wednesday morning.My alarm wakes 
 me with its usual call.About ten      
 minutes later I get out of bed and go 
 downstairs for breakfast.While it is  
 cooking I feed the goldfish.When my   
 bacon is ready to eat I take it out of
 the grill and make a sandwich.        
  After breakfast I go outside to check
 the mouse traps.We have not caught    
 anything today.Just before I go to    
 school at around 8.30 I feed our      
 tropical fish the bacon left over from
 breakfast.I shout "goodbye,"to my     
 parents and start my walk to school.  
 Our school is called Gotham Primary   
 and it is about 10 minutes walk from  
 our house.                            
                                       
                                       </content>
