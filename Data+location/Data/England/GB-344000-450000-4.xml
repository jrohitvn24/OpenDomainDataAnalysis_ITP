		<content>     Cockerham Church,dedicated to St. 
 Michael, was in existence in 1153.    
 Several churches have been built on   
 the site, which stands isolated on    
 high ground, surrounded by fields.The 
 present Church dates from 1910.At the 
 West end,attached to the Church,is the
 Tower dating from l589,which contains 
 a peal of six bells. The Church       
 consists of a central nave and two    
 side aisles,with an entrance on the   
 North side. There is very little      
 stained glass,only the East window,   
 depicting the four evangelists, and   
 two memorial windows.The Churchyard   
 surrounding the Church is used for the
 burial of parishioners.Cockerham was  
 originally the mother Church to the   
 neighbouring churches of Ellel &amp; Shire
 shead.In 1974 the Parish of Cockerham 
 was joined with Winmarleigh,sharing   
 one Vicar,who resides in Cockerham.   </content>
