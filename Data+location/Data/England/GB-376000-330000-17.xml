This area has remained a rich habitat  
for many animals. Farmers have not     
destroyed hedges in order to enlarge   
their fields, thus retaining a rich    
environment for wildlife.              
Common field birds abound and the rarer
Curlew and Meadowlark live in the area.
Gosshawks have been observed bringing  
down prey in flight.  Water birds are  
abundant because of the many ponds and 
pools. These pools provide a resting   
place for migrants.  There is a bird   
sanctuary, Jackson's Coppice, which is 
well used by local ornithologists.     
Foxes are common in this area and are  
seen both day and night, the local hunt
meets twice each season.               
The woods are home to many badgers,    
which can often be seen in the lanes at
dusk, searching for food.
