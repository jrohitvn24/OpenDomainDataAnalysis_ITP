 Crowthorne Fire Station is a Class D  
 which means it takes twenty minutes to
 get to a fire. It has four fully      
 retained firemen and twelve more on   
 call. Last year they were called out  
 to 11 chimney fires, 6 forest fires,  
 40 open calls (cows in ditches,cats   
 in trees, people locked out of        
 houses),5 rescues (car crashes), 24   
 special services, 68 genuine false    
 alarms and 13 pranks. They were on    
 standby 161 times when another fire   
 station had been called to a fire.
