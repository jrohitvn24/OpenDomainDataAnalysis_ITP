		<content>  I have sandwiches which are kept in  
 an old ice-cream box.Inside I have an 
 old tub with sultanas in.I have one   
 sandwich with cucumber spread in white
 bread,and one with cheese spread in   
 brown bread.I have a raw carrot,a     
 piece of cheese and a "special" like a
 chocolate biscuit or bag of crisps.   
 Also in a blue plastic flask I have   
 water or squash.                      
  After lunch we go out to play until  
 1:30.We usually play a chasing game or
 a game with a ball. In the afternoons 
 we have Science,History,Geography,    
 Games or Art.We clear up ready to go  
 home at 3:15.Sometimes we stay for    
 Clubs.                                
  I meet my mum and we walk home,then  
 watch childrens television until it's 
 over.We have supper when my dad comes 
 home and a game with him afterwards.At
 9:00 I go to bed and read until 9:30. </content>
