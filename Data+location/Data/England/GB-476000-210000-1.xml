		<title>01THE EGYPTIAN SPRINGS</title>
		<content>In Lower Hartwell there is a natural   
spring .It is called The Egytian       
spring.It has two square basins        
about   one metre long to collect      
water to act  as a water trough.There  
is also a little cavern by the         
springs. The water at one time         
supplied  the farm which only fairly   
recently turned to the mainwater       
supply.the water now is used for the   
cattle.There is Egyptain writing on    
the cavern and in English means"water  
is best".It was  built by a            
tee-totaller who was very              
interested in Egypt.He held an annual  
celebration of water,after which he    
gave a sum of money to the nearest     
inn(the Bugle Horn)for its loss of     
money from the sale of alcohol.What he 
did not realize was that many so       
called "tee-totallers"were slipping    
away to the pubs.                      </content>
