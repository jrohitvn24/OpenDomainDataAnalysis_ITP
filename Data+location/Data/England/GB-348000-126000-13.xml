		<content> The doctors have made plans to make a 
 new surgery because the old one is    
 inconveniant,not big enough and it    
 does not have enough facilities.It    
 will cost around Â£140,000.The land was
 mostly bought from a man called Murray
 Mountain and some other small bits    
 were bought from other people.The     
 land was bought for about Â£25,000.    
                                       
    The new surgery will have 14 or 15 
 members of staff part time and full   
 time.There will be 3 doctors,1 full   
 time nurse,1 part time nurse,2 part   
 time health visitors,1 midwife, 1     
 nursing auxilllery,4 part time        
 receptionists and 1 cleaner plus the  
 odd one or two extras.The three       
 doctors are Dr. Jeffrey Webb,Dr.Roger 
 Bark and Dr. Elaine Griffiths.        
 There are just over 5000 patients     
 regestered with them.                 </content>
