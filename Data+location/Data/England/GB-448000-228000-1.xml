 The block consists of a transect      
 across the Cherwell Valley having the 
 Oxford Canal and the Bicester-Banbury 
 and Oxford Banbury railways alongside 
 the river. Primarily it is a thinly   
 populated farming area with only one  
 village. Farming is mostly arable but 
 with some milk and beef cattle based  
 on the water meadows. The main crop is
 barley, with some wheat and rape and  
 fodder beans occasionally seen. The   
 farms are medium sized, 140-240       
 hectares, employing only 2-3 men with 
 the working farmer. Most of the land  
 is used for shooting with some rearing
 of pheasants and duck. The area       
 attracts retired people while the USAF
 Base at Upper Heyford puts pressure on
 housing. There is not much new housing
 development. The Oxford Canal has     
 summer visitors in hired narrow boats.</content>
