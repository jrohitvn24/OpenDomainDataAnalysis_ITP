		<title>19A DAY IN THE COUNTRY</title>
		<content> The date is Sunday the 16th June 1985 
and it is a warm Summer's day just     
right for a picnic!                    
 We find a spot on farmland near Golden
Cross under a large broken branch with 
a wonderful view across the fields to  
Chiddingly church.                     
 Our lunch consists of ham sandwhices  
(49p a qtr lb); local meat pies (45p   
each); salad bought fresh from a local 
farm shop; fresh strawberries picked at
a PYO (pick your own) centre down the  
road for only 40p a lb. This was washed
down with a bottle of a local          
elderberry wine which cost only 1.99   
 While sleeping off the lunch under a  
hot midday sun, the silence was        
interrupted by the screech of an RAF   
figter aircraft as it flew overhead.   
 Soon it was time to return to         
normality ane for work on Monday !
