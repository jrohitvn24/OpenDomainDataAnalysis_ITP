		<content> My favourite sport is squash .I am    
 very keen on the game .I play at      
 Carlisle squash rackets club which is 
 next to the rugby pitch and the       
 rugby club bar . Right next to that   
 is Brunton Park, the football ground. 
 I get coached by a professional       
 squash player called Ronny Bell .     
 I have a racket that cost Â£37. It is  
 called a Dunlop Maxpli but most people
 use the new carbon fibre  one's. They 
 cost Â£50_55 . The squash club  has 8  
 courts.  Courts 7 and 8 are surrounded
 by a stadium where finals are played. 
 I will soon enter the junior league   
 and then start entering the           
 competitions and hopefully by the age 
 of 12_13 I will play for the county.  
 My greatest ambition is to be the     
 world's number 1 but I can't see much 
 of that happening.
