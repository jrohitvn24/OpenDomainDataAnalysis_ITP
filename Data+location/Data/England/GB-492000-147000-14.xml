		<title>14NORTH DOWNS WAY PUTTENHAM</title>
		<content> There is an ancient route of lanes and
 footpaths between Winchester and      
 Canterbury which has long been known  
 as the{Pilgrims Way.}Hilaire Belloc   
 walked it and wrote about it in "The  
 Old Road." Mediaeval fairs were held  
 in Puttenham to attract the custom of 
 the Pilgrims.                         
 This route has recently been sign-    
 posted as one of the long distance    
 foot-paths and is now known as the    
{North Downs Way.}It enters Puttenham  
 at Totford Hatch, crosses the Common  
 and passes Lascombe House, designed by
 Lutyens, before it forms part of the  
 village street. It crosses the golf   
 course on Puttenhem Heath and passes  
 under the A3, where it is marked by   
 two giant crosses. The North Downs Way
 enters Compton near the Watts Gallery 
 and continues up the hill to          
 Guildford.                            </content>
