		<title>14Barnsley Pool</title>
		<content> By the farm yard,past yapping dogs and
 hissing geese, down the gulley between
 sandstone walls,wavey and red to the  
 dark green pool,full of duck          
 weed,ducks and larvae. Willows bend   
 their heads the water's edge, cattle  
 churn the mud to foam as they come to 
 drink. So many plants and insects,    
 some I have never seen before.        
 Barnsley pool is long and narrow, it  
 lies in the bottom of a natural dip,  
 with rough pasture rising from its    
 edges. Around the pool are a number of
 sandstone rocks and some very old     
 trees.Living on and around the pool   
 are a number of wild duck, they       
 probably nest here in the Spring, they
 are close neighbours to the little    
 darting moorhens who live under the   
 old willow roots the whole year round.
