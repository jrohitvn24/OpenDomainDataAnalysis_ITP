		<title>10LANDSCAPE OF UPPER FROYLE</title>
		<content> Part of Upper Froyle has been         
 landscaped in the past as parkland for
 the{Manor House.} There is a ha-ha at 
 the side of the house and an avenue of
 lime trees from the house to the main 
 road as a carriage-way.               
 The garden  of {Froyle Place}is laid  
 out with pond, rockery, flower beds   
 and yew hedges.  These used to be cut 
 in many shapes but have been cut back 
 at present because they became too    
 thick.                                
 The larger houses have well laid out  
 gardens, the smaller have picturesque 
 'cottage gardens' and there are {     
{allotment gardens} in Upper Froyle.   
                                       
                                       
 The Beeches are a beautiful{line of   
{beech trees} dividing Lower Froyle    
 from Upper Froyle.
