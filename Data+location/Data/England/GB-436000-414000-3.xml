		<title>03Land Reclamation in Ryhill</title>
		<content> Coal extraction at the Anglers        
 Opencast site near Wintersett ceased  
 in 1983 and NCB reclamation work      
 began.                                
 Of the original 530 acres of the      
 workings,395 will be returned to      
 agricultural uses. The land will      
 remain NCB responsibility for five    
 years while its quality is improved.  
 The remainder,a 70-acre lake and      
 landscaped surrounds,will become a    
 recreation area under local authority 
 supervision with facilities for       
 sailing,windsurfing,angling etc.      
 The lake will have no natural water   
 supply and will depend on pipeline    
 connexion with the adjoining          
 Wintersett reservoirs.The area will   
 also remain NCB responsibility for    
 five years while the effectiveness of 
 the water supply is established.
