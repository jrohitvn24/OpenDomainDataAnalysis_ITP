		<content> Our block consists mainly of farmland 
 with the village of Newick            
 approximately at the centre. Part of  
 the hamlet of Piltdown is also in the 
 block. Thus our block is typical rural
 East Sussex. The population of our    
 block is 2,500 approx.                
 There are three main farm combines but
 very many farm houses, a reminder of  
 when small, individual, family farms  
 were the order of the day. A disused  
 railway line runs from north to south 
 at the western edge of the block. The 
 River Ouse also runs from north to    
 south. The village of Newick lies     
 between the two.                      
 The A272, one of the few east-west    
 roads in Sussex, runs through the     
 block and centre of Newick.
