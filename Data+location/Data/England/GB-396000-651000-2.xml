		<title>02RIVER TWEED SALMON FISHING</title>
		<content> Method: The fishing of the river TWEED
 is done from fishing shiels.Nets are  
 rowed out in a circle and are then    
 winched in.When the fish are caught   
 they are hit with a stick.They are    
 then taken to an ice house until the  
 end of the day.The number of salmon   
 caught in 1984 was 18,478.Numbers have
 declined through the 1970's due partly
 to a fungal disease and partly to     
 increased poaching.                   
 The fishing season starts on Feb.14   
 and ends on Sept.14 each year.Fish run
 up river on the incoming tide.Each    
 day's fishing depends on tide times.  
 Downstream of the fishing area,each   
 shiel has a look-out point to spot    
 fish running up-river.The shiel has   
 bunks and a fireplace and is now      
 supplied with electricity.Night       
 fishing can go on by floodlight.Each  
 shiel employs four men.               </content>
