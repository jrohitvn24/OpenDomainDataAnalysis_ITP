		<title>11LITTLE CLAYDONS FARM C'FORD</title>
		<content>   During the war in 1944, a V 2 bomb  
 fell at Little Claydons Farm and left 
 a big hole where the farmhouse was.   
 The farm has 222 acres and it was     
 mentioned in the original Domesday    
 Book. They have 200 cows and each cow 
 produces about 4 gallons of milk a    
 day. The cows are milked twice a day, 
 first at 5 a.m. and again at 3 p.m.   
 The milk is sold to the Milk Marketing
 Board every day. About 200 calves are 
 born each year. The cows are very     
 upset when their calves are taken     
 away. The farm has a machine          
 which lifts the cows on to their      
 sides, in order to have their hooves  
 trimmed. In the winter the cows are   
 put into cubicle buildings. There are 
 two tower silos about 70 feet high    
 which are used for storing cattle     
 food.                                 
                                       </content>
