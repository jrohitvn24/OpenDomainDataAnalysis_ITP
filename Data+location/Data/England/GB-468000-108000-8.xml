		<title>08FACILITIES IN WATERLOOVILLE</title>
		<content> The sports facilities are quite good  
 in Waterlooville.Although the nearest 
 swimming pool is in Havant,our nearest
 tennis courts are at Jubilee          
 Park,which also has a bowling green   
 and a playground for children.Also at 
 Jubilee Park they play football in the
 winter on the big pitch,and cricket in
 the summer.                           
     The nearest wood is the Queen's   
 Inclosure which is on the main London 
 Road.                                 
    The nearest cinema is in Havant,and
 there are no theatres or concert halls
 in Waterlooville either.              
    We do not have many children's     
 activities going on in                
 Waterlooville,but the shops are quite 
 good and there is a library.There are 
 not many churches in our area.
