 be opened after the War. The Church   
 was and is called{St Mary's}it is very
 old and is being restored, the School 
 has been closed for a long time and is
 now in wrecks. The Church, School and 
 Mundon hall were the centre of the    
 Village but a plague came and the     
 people moved.{The White horse}has been
 in Mundon for a long time. In Mundon  
 there was a shop but it had to be     
 closed because hardly anybody used it.
 The post office and garage has been   
 closed aswell.{White House Manor      
 is  probably the main attraction.
