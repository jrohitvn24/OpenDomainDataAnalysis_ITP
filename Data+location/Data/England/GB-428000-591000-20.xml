		<content>{BUSES.                                
  The bus service runs half-hourly     
 through the village in each direction.
 During the day many of the buses are  
 running with only a few passengers.   
{RAILWAYS.}                            
  A railway track bisects the village. 
 At one time villagers used the train  
 as another means of transport- this   
 was known locally as the "Tankie".    
  At the present time discussions are  
 being held to draw up plans to remove 
 the entire track and landscape tha    
 railway area.This will provide another
 place where people can meet and pass  
 the time of day.It should also change 
 the complexion of the village quite   
 dramatically.                         
{HORSES.}                              
  Many of the men are involved in      
 collecting sea-coal.Horses and carts  
 are a normal part of our village life.</content>
