		<title>12Purbrook Heath Farm</title>
		<content>  Mr. Heath owns a dairy farm. He uses 
 his 88 acres for cows, apart from a   
 tiny 3 acres for potatoes. The farm is
 over 100 years old. (He has farmed    
 there since 1969).                    
  During World War One the farm grew   
 vegetables, under control. He has 1   
 cow dog to look after 90 cows, 50 of  
 which are milking ones. He gets 223000
 litres of milk a year. He keeps his   
 grass for cows under tyres. Most of   
 his cows are Friesian.                
 He has two boys, one helps on the     
 farm. He does his own milking twice a 
 day at 6.00 a.m. and 3.30 p.m. and can
 milk four cows at a time with his     
 milking machine. He sells his potatoes
 at the gate, and keeps poultry which  
 he sells for the table.               
  The farm is part of the Southwick    
 Estate which altogether covers        
 fourteen square miles.                </content>
