		<content>  The principal feature of the square  
 is farmland,used for cattle grazing   
 and stock rearing.There are no bus    
 stops, so there is no bus route.There 
 is only one post-box, which is quite  
 far for some people to walk.Also only 
 one public telephone-box, so most     
 families do need a phone in their own 
 houses.A recreation site in this area 
 provides inadequate recreation        
 facilities for the residents,{ONLY}   
 holding a cricket ground with no      
 swings or slides.There are five public
 houses for leisure purposes.There is{ 
{ONLY ONE}shop which sells everything  
 apart from newspapers and clothes.In  
 all the farming land in this area,    
 there are seventeen farms altogether. 
 Mainly old people live in our area,not
 many people of our age group live     
 there only a few of our friends.
