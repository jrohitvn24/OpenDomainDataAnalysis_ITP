		<title>01THE FYLINGDALES LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content> Standing in the heather on the moor   
 and looking down five hundred feet,   
 there is Fylingdales lying in an      
 amphitheatre.  Steep slopes give way  
 to green fields where cattle graze and
 there are crops of oil seed rape and  
 corn.                                 
 Down the hill is Fylingthorpe where a 
 green copper church spire juts above  
 the red pantile roofs.  Then comes the
 village school together with its      
 prefabricated classroom, its          
 playground and field.  Across the road
 is the Fylingdales Inn and the village
 post office stands on the crossroads. 
 Next to the school is the fire station
 with its high practice tower and radio
 antenna which keeps in touch with     
 headquarters at Northallerton.  The   
 part time firemen are summoned by     
 pocket bleepers when they are needed.
