		<content>  The{education system}in Jersey       
 differs from that of the United       
 Kingdom. The States of Jersey run 23  
 primary schools for the ages 5-11,and 
 4 secondary schools catering for 11-16
 year olds. At the age of 14 children  
 have an option of transferring to     
 Hautlieu school (14-18 year olds) for 
 "O" and "A" levels. There is also a   
 college of adult and further education
 (Highlands) which provides vocational 
 training. The 2 Colleges, Victoria and
 The Jersey College for Girls are      
 direct grant public schools and a     
 further 5 private schools, including 2
 RC secondary schools, are grant aided.
  Within this block are several        
 schools: 2 primary, 2 secondary,      
 Hautlieu, Highlands and St Michaels (a
 private school).
