		<title>12THE SYTCH</title>
		<content> The Sytch is located on the bottom    
 right hand corner of our block.  The  
 Sytch is a wood with all kinds of     
 trees in it.  In the middle of the    
 wood there is a little stream with    
 bracken around it.  The first man we  
 interviewed on the local history of   
 "The Sytch" was called Mr. Frank Evans
 who used the wood from "The Sytch"for 
 his sawmill.  He told us that he      
 thought a bus came through once a week
 that took people to the local town of 
 Wellington.  He walks about two miles 
 each day to the local village of Great
 Bolas for his newspaper.  He thought  
 that The Sytch was named after Lord   
 Clive of India.  Mr. Evans is the only
 person who lives on The Sytch.  The   
 nearest primary school is in          
 Tibberton.  A vast amount of trees    
 have disappeared in the 35 years he   
 has lived on The Sytch.               </content>
