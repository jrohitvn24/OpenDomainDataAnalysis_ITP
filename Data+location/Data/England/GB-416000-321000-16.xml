		<content>   Only one{Post Office}serves the     
 area. It is situated in the centre of 
 Rangemore village, in Chapel Lane, and
 it is also the village store.         
   As it is the only post office in the
 area it is very necessary and         
 important for collecting Old Age      
 Pensions, Family Allowances, and all  
 other State Benefits.                 
   All the usual facilities of a post  
 office are available here.            
   A{post collecting box}can also be   
 found on Tatenhill Common, about a    
 mile away.                            
   Nearly everyone has their own       
{telephone}in this area and this is    
 necessary as the village is small and 
 many of the houses are scattered.     
   There are two{public telephone      
{boxes.}One is in Rangemore village,   
 and the other is on Tatenhill Common.
