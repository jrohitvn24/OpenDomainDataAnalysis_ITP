woman who stands upright, resting her  
hands on an anchor. She is dressed in a

with a hood. She has long hair which   
reaches her shoulders and has bare feet

men from Dudley who lost their lives in
the two world wars.There are 80 names  
altogether,58 from W.W.1 and 22 from   
W.W.2. It is made from soft marble.It  
was unveiled on Feb. 15,1923 by Mrs.   
Shaw-Storey who owned Arcot Hall and   
most of the land around Dudley.Each    
Armistice Day(Nov.11) those who        
survived the battles of the 2 wars     
attend a service at St. Paul's Church,

monument.
