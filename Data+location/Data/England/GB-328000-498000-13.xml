		<content>    Increasing mechanisation, and the  
 amalgamation of fell farms led to a   
 decline in the number of workers      
 needed on the land, and this in turn  
 led to{rural depopulation.}This       
 problem is not as acute in this area  
 as it is in other remote parts of the 
 country, because of the stabilising   
 effect of alternative sources of      
 income, e.g. tourism. Nevertheless,   
 many of the fell farms are lonely, and
 farmers' wives sometimes have a       
 particular sense of{isolation.        
    In addition, not all of a farmer's 
 children will be able to, or indeed   
 want to, continue with the farm, and  
 many young people must leave the area 
 to find employment. Those that stay   
 find the cost of local housing very   
 high, because of the pressure on      
 prices from buyers outside the area   
 looking for{holiday homes.            </content>
