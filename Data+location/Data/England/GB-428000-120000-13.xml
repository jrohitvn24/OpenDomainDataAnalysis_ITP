		<content> There is limited scope for            
 entertainment in the area. One reason 
 for this is the high proportion of    
 elderly people living in the area.    
 Amongst those we questioned we found  
 many interested in gardening.         
 Listening to the radio and watching   
 television were also mentioned as     
 means of entertainment.               
                                       
 There is neither a cinema nor a       
 theatre in the area. Those who require
 such facilities would have to go to   
 either Southampton or Salisbury. Horse
 riding is a popular activity and there
 is plenty of grassland to maintain    
 considerable numbers of horses.       
 Unusually there is only one pub in the
 area, The Hatchet, and the only       
 football pitch in the area has been   
 abandoned to the sheep. However, most 
 people seem happy with the situation. </content>
