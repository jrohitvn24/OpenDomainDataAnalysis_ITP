		<title>12Clifton Airfield</title>
		<content>  Clifton Airfield during the war was a
  non_operational training airfield    
 co_operational between the Royal Air  
 Force and the Army. Lysanders,used to 
 land in France to drop off agents,    
 were kept there. Soldiers and air-men 
 were billeted on local people for a   
 guinea a week. After the war Halifax  
 Bomber Aircraft were landed on the    
 airfield and then broken up by gangs  
 of men. The aeroplanes were stacked   
 into a heap about 12 metres high and  
 90 metres long on the edge of the     
 airfield. At the moment there is an   
 attempt being made by a group of      
 enthusiasts to find enough parts to   
 rebuild just one Halifax Bomber. Mr   
 and Mrs Leaf of Clifton Gate who have 
 farmed here for 38 years told us of a 
 farm road which was made of Halifax   
 Bomber wings.The road is now buried   
 beneath a hay field.                  </content>
