		<title>06EDUCATION THE PRIVETT CENTRE</title>
		<content> The old school together with the      
 attractive school house has been      
 refurbished and renamed the "Privett  
 Centre". Here, children of all ages   
 from the Basingstoke town area        
 experience a complete change of       
 environment. They study the           
 countryside and farming with the      
 co-operation of local farmers.        
 Sometimes they come to the Centre just
 for a few days' quiet private study.  
 The Centre can accommodate up to 18   
 children and staff for periods of up  
 to a week. They are encouraged to do  
 their own catering and the special    
 mini-bus in which they arrive is at   
 their service for sight-seeing. The   
 Centre also serves as a holiday home  
 for severely physically and mentally  
 handicapped children who come for     
 short breaks accompanied by volunteer 
 schoolchildren to assist the staff.   </content>
