		<title>15The Coaching Town</title>
		<content> In the 18th century Boroughbridge     
 reached the peak of its prosperity.   
 It was a halting place for stage      
 coaches and a marketing centre.       
    The first ever mail coach from     
 London to the north of the town       
 stopped at Boroughbridge for meals and
 for accommodation.These coach services
 brought trade to Boroughbridge.The    
 Crown Hotel was one of several other  
 inns and it had stabling for over a   
 hundred horses.The Three Horse Shoes  
 inn got its name from all the stabling
 and coaching they had there.All the   
 inns had special places for their     
 coaches to get in the courts which    
 were usually at the rear of the inn.
