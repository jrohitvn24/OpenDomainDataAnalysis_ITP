{Merchants Ltd}is a private limited    
 company which was bought by the       
 present owners in 1947, engaged       
 primarily in converting Rough Timber  
 into sawn dimensions against          
 customer's requirements using both    
 hardwood and softwood.                
 With the advances in{timber

 is increasing at the expense of       
 hardwood, hence their production is   
 altering to suit.                     
 They send timber within a 300 mile    
 radius, customer usage varying from   
 fencing, construction industries,     
 civil engineering, packaging, pallets 
 and furniture.
