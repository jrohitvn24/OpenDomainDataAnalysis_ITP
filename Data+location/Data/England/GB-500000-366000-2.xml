 A typical day in our house starts at  
 half past seven when I get up. I have 
 my breakfast at eight o'-clock. I have
 cornflakes. Everyone is dressed and   
 washed and on their way to school or  
 work by a quarter to nine. My sister  
 and I go to school and my mum goes to 
 work at Newark to work in the Social  
 Services. My dad is a car body worker 
 at Washingborough. When I get home at 
 half past three I watch TV. It is on  
 all evening until my mum and dad have 
 gone to bed. At about half past seven 
 the family has tea. We usually have   
 pork chops, beans, cabbage and        
 gravy.Then we watch TV until bedtime. 
 I go to bed between ten and half past.
