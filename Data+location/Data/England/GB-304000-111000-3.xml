		<title>03UNITED REFORMED CHURCH</title>
		<content>  The {United Reformed Church}was built
 in {1720}and extensively rebuilt in { 
{1862-3.}Formerly the{Methodist Church}
 with a resident vicar. The church is  
 now looked after by voluntary lay     
 preachers and the {Old Manse}where the
 vicar used to live was sold in 1978.  
   There has been a great revival in   
 attendance at the church recently     
 owing to the enthusiasm of a few of   
 its members. In {1979} the ceiling was
 lowered and a community room was built
 on the first floor which was created. 
 Many other{amienities}were added,     
 including a kitchen and toilets, which
 enabled a much greater range of       
 activities to take place there with an
 emphasis on encouraging the attendance
 of children.                          
   There are now meetings there most   
 days of the week with up to{60 adults 
 and as many children attending weekly.</content>
