		<title>17HAMPTON DRAW DOCK</title>
		<content>   The{Hampton Draw Dock was important 
{to the water companies}in the late    
 nineteenth century because at that    
 time the roads were not good and the  
{fuel used by the engines driving the  
{water pumps was coal}and so           
 transportation by sailing barge became
 the obvious solution.                 
   At first six large steam engines    
 drove the pumps which forced the water
 through the mains and the amount of   
 fuel needed was immense.  Over recent 
 years{the steam engines have been     
{replaced by electric turbine engines  
 and consequently the dock has been    
 decreasing in importance.             
{  On the 5th of July 1985 the last    
{steam pump was shut down}by 93 year   
 old Mr.Woodcock who had worked at the 
 waterworks for most of his life.
