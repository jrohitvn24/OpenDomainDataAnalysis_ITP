		<title>02A Local Farm</title>
		<content> Our farm covers 150 acres. The name   
 of our farm is Upper Dudnill. The     
 farmhouse is 313 years old. It was    
 built in 1672.                        
 We have a sheepdog called Peggy. She  
 gets the cows in to be milked every   
 morning and night. My Grandad helps my
 dad on the farm. He is the shepherd.  
 They do all the work between them. We 
 keep cows, sheep and calves. We have  
 cattleyards to keep the cows in. There
 are Friesian and Charolais cows and   
 Suffolk and Clun sheep.               
 We grow barley and maize which we feed
 to the animals. We sell our milk to   
 the Milk Marketing Board. The milk    
 goes into a tank from the milking     
 parlour and a milk lorry comes to     
 collect it. We have three tractors, a 
 combine harvester and three trailers. 
 Sometimes I make camps in the straw   
 and hay in the barn.                  </content>
