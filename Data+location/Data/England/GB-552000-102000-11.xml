		<title>11Wilmington Priory</title>
		<content> Wilmington Priory dates back to       
 Norman times. It is owned by the      
 Sussex Archaeological Society and     
 includes an excellent agricultural    
 museum.                               
                                       
 Much of the Priory is in ruins but it 
 is easy to see where the walls of the 
 building were. The South wall of the  
 14th Century Hall is still standing   
 and shows what an impressive building 
 this was. You can still see the well  
 and go down into the Medieval Crypt.  
                                       
 Exhibits in the agricultural          
 museum include a vast array of 18th   
 and 19th Century farm implements,     
 mainly from Sussex. In the Tudor      
 kitchen there are exhibits of kitchen 
 implements while in the porch are     
 larger pieces of agricultural         
 machinery.                            </content>
