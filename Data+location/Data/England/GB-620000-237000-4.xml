		<title>04THAMES SAILING BARGES</title>
		<content>  Most Thames Sailing Barges are about 
85 feet long and 18 feet beam. They    
have flat bottoms, and leeboards       
instead of a keel. Most of them were   
built from wood, but some were steel.  
Barges are sprit-rigged. They go quite 
fast because they have big sails. The  
crew on a barge was small. They were   
sailed by a man and a boy. Barges were 
used for transporting hay, straw, coal 
and gravel, around the East Coast. Now 
they are mainly used for chartering.   
Some are still privately owned, and    
some are owned by companies or their   
Social Clubs. Barges often visit Pin   
Mill during the Summer. Each year the  
Pin Mill Sailing Club organises a Barge
Match. The barges provide a splendid   
sight as they race out to sea and      
back. After the Match is over many     
of the  barges sail onto the Hard,     
grounding there as the tide falls.     </content>
