		<title>13PIG FARMING DRINKSTONE</title>
		<content> My Dad works on Mr. Clarke's pig farm.
 It covers 40 acres and 8 men work     
 there. They have 3,000 pigs. The      
 breeds are Large White, Landrace and  
 Essex. The pigs come in at 20 weeks.  
 They eat potatoes, vegetable waste and
 apples. They are sold at 34 weeks to  
 Haverhill Meat Ltd. The meat goes to  
 Sainsburys.                           
 The Tractor Collection at the Pig     
 Farm. My Dad collects old tractors. He
 has eight. He has one loader and two  
 ploughs. They are Fordsons, Nuffields 
 and Fergusons. They were made between 
 1947 and 1955. The oldest is a 1947   
 Fordson. He collects them from farms  
 all round. He repairs and paints them.
 All of them are in working condition. 
 Our whole school walked over the      
 fields to draw his tractors. My Mum   
 gave the children biscuits and a      
 drink.                                </content>
