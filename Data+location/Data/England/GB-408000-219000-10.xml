		<content> The Notgrove Village Cricket Club,    
 reformed about 3 years ago, plays on a
 beautiful pitch near the Manor. The   
 teas are served in the village hall.  
 The team is made up of enthusiasts    
 mainly from the 2 nearby villages of  
 Turkdean and Cold Aston. They play a  
 full Summer programme of maybe a home 
 game on Saturday, and an away game on 
 Sunday. Ajoining the Cricket Ground is
 a private hard surface Tennis Court,  
 owned by the Manor and used by them   
 and their invited guests. There are no
 football, hockey or skittles teams in 
 the village, but darts are played in  
 the village hall. On Monday evenings  
 children of the village are allowed to
 swim in a private swimming pool in one
 of the gardens of the village.
