		<title>03NEW HOUSING IN BREAN</title>
		<content>            ONE OF THE NEW HOUSING     
ESTATES IN BREAN,IS A MIXTURE OF HOUSES
AND BUNGALOWS.IT IS A FAIRLY BIG ESTATE
WITH FOUR CLOSES,PINE WOOD WAY,WESLEY  
CLOSE AND HUETT CLOSE.MOST OF THE      
HOUSES AND BUNGALOWS ARE SIX TO SEVEN  
YEARS OLD.WE TALKED TO A FEW PEOPLE AND
ASKED THEM QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THEY    
LIKE THE AREA THEY LIVE IN.WE ASKED    
THEM IF IT'S SAFE FOR LITTLE CHILDREN  
TO PLAY BECAUSE OF THE ROADS,MOST OF   
THE PEOPLE WE TALKED TO SAID THE ROADS 
WERE VERY BAD AND ALSO THERE ARE NOT   
ENOUGH FOOTPATHS.THEY WANTED SOMETHING 
DONE ABOUT IT,BECAUSE IT IS DANGEROUS  
FOR LITTLE CHILDREN AND OLDER PEOPLE.  
           PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND BUSES  
IN THAT AREA IS BAD,THERE IS NOT MUCH  
ENTERTAINMENT FOR YOUNGER PEOPLE AROUND
THAT AREA IT'S MOSTLY ON BURNHAM.      
                                       
                                       </content>
