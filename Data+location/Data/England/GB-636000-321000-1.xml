		<content> The Catfield and Sutton Block is an   
 area of flat arable farmland sloping  
 gently from east to west.The fields   
 and dykes drain into Barton Broad and 
 the reed covered Sutton Broad. The    
 River Ant flows southwards through    
 Barton towards the Bure.In winter the 
 landscape can appear bleak, but in    
 summer the whole area is carpeted in  
 green beneath wide blue Norfolk       
 skies.The area is sparsely populated  
 with most inhabitants living in the   
 villages of Sutton and Catfield. Most 
 of the houses in Sutton are built     
 alongside the Old Yarmouth Road.      
 Buildings in Catfield are grouped     
 around the Post Office and public     
 house. Both villages have been by     
 passed by the re-routing of the A149  
 which now follows the course of the   
 old M.G.N.J. Railway.
