		<content>  There is{woodland}facing our school. 
 The woodland can be found between{Park
{Hill Rd and Nursery Rd.}It is lovely  
 to have a wild area that is just like 
 the countryside{2 miles}away from the 
{centre of Birmingham.}It is owned by  
 the Calthorpe Estate and they take    
 care of it.                           
  In the woods there are many types of 
{deciduous trees}eg.silver birch,ash,  
 poplar,willow and oak. The other thing
 to make the wood beautiful is{wild    
{flowers}such as cow parsley,blue-bells
 buttercups,selfheal,nettles,ferns,    
 dandelion,forget-me-not and ivy. There
 are many beautiful{insects and        
{butterflies.                          
  Three years ago(1982) there was a bad
 winter and some trees died and were   
 felled. The Calthorpe Estate planted  
 new saplings of sycamore and willow.
