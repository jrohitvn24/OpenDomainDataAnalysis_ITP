Mum gets up and gets ready for work.   
Then my brother gets up and gets ready 
for school. I get up about 8.00a.m.    
Mum then leaves for work. Dad's away at
work. I get ready for school and we    
leave the house at 8.45a.m. I call for 
Emma, Spencer calls for Ian and then we
go to school. We have dinner at school 
at 12.00. I get home from school about 
3.30p.m.,Spencer gets home about 4.00, 
Mum gets home between 5.00 or 6.00p.m.

T.V. or go out to play, or we go with  
Mum when she plays netball.
