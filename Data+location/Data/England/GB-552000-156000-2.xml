		<content>When we first came to Kemsing in 1957  
it was a sleepy village with one bus an
hour and the threat to the Dartford    
Tunnel and the M25 which was to be     
routed beyond the stream and between   
the Oast Houses and our woods. When the
tunnel was built many more cars came   
onto the roads and in Otford village   
the transporters started trying to     
negotiate the small village pond.      
Next came the {Sevenoaks by-pass} at   
the top of Polehill. This was planned  
take away the village traffic.  It     
didn't, and village life altered as the
traffic increased. It was no longer    
safe to push prams along the narrow    
pavements, and eventually heavy traffic
was banned from the village High Street
but not at the pond. The use of country
footpaths is the only way we can get   
away from the traffic. We hope the     
nearly completed M25 will help.        </content>
