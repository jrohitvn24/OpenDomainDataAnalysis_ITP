		<title>03The Marina</title>
		<content> The Marina is down Woodrolf road near 
 the water front.   The boats are like 
 dominoes in a line because there is   
 hardly any space between them.   The  
 Marina is a private place where boats 
 are kept but you have to pay to keep  
 your boats in there.   My Grandad used
 to put his boat in there but now he   
 doesn't because he thought it was too 
 expensive.   People all over          
 Colchester and Maldon area keep their 
 boats moored at Tollesbury Marina.    
 They are nearly all sailing boats.    
 The Marina has been there about 14    
 years, the cruising club is opposite  
 it.   There are about 150 boats       
 moored in the Marina.   The Marina is 
 tidal.
