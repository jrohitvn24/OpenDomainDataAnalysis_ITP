		<content> The{village}was all fields and a few  
 houses. A farmyard and barn stood next
 to the church. Gypsies camped along a 
 grassy drove, where the Village       
 College is now. Crown Lane was very   
 narrow with a blacksmith's at the     
 bottom. Audley House stood at the top 
 of Church Lane and the curate lived in
 the house between the Boys' and Girls'
 schools.                              
                                       
 There was a chaff factory near the    
 station and a mill farther down the   
 road to Black Horse Drove. Barges used
 to come along the river from Kings    
 Lynn and unload at the{docks.         
 The area known as the Moors used to be
 flooded and frozen over in the winter 
 and used for{skating}matches as well  
 as along the river. Long skates called
 fen runners were used and the champion
 was called Smart.                     </content>
