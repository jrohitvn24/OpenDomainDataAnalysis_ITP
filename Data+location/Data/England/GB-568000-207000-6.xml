		<content>  {Newlands Spring}School was opened in
{1981}as a new{open plan school.}The   
 ages of the people on the estate range
 from very young to very old. Many of  
 the elderly people visited our school 
 and gave their impressions and talked 
 of their own school days and how      
 things have changed.                  
                                       
   Our school is very bright and       
 colourful. Each bay is beautifully    
 decorated and has plenty of display   
 areas for childrens' work. The windows
 are large letting in a lot of light.  
 The bays have carpets covering the    
 floor apart from the art areas which  
 are lino-covered. Our interviews      
 showed us that school was not always  
 like this. One elderly gentleman told 
 us that his school was cold and dark  
 and that the toilets were across the  
 playground and often froze in winter. </content>
