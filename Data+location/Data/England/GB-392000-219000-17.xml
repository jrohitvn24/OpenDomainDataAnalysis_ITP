		<title>17A CHELTENHAM GIRL'S DAY</title>
		<content> I live in Fernleigh Cresent which has 
 a good view over part of the Cotswold 
 Hills.Leckhampton Hill stands out in  
 particular and is very beautiful.I    
 wake up each day and look out on our  
 garden.I get changed into my summer   
 school uniform which is a checked_blue
 dress.I wash,comb my hair and go down 
 for breakfast which consists of       
 cereal,toast and a cup of tea.I brush 
 my teeth and get ready for school.My  
 mother takes me to school in our      
 Cortina Estate.It takes about 5 mins. 
 for it is about a mile away.When we   
 arrive we wait for the whistle and    
 when we go in we have lessons till 20 
 past 10 then we have assembly.After   
 play there are more lessons till 12   
 o'clock.School dinner follows,then    
 more lessons.At home again,I play ball
 games with my friends and we talk     
 about things we have done that day.   </content>
