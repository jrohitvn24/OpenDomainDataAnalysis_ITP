		<title>20THE TOWN OF BOURNEMOUTH</title>
		<content>   BOURNEMOUTH IS SITUATED ON THE SOUTH
 COAST OF ENGLAND BETWEEN THE ANCIENT  
 TOWNS OF POOLE AND CHRISTCHURCH.  THE 
 TOWN IS FAMOUS AS A HOLIDAY RESORT,   
 PERHAPS BECAUSE OF THE SUN, SAND AND  
 SEA.  IT IS ALSO A USEFUL TOURING     
 CENTRE FOR THE LOCAL ATTRACTIVE       
 COUNTRYSIDE INCLUDING THE NEW FOREST. 
   RECENTLY THE LOCAL AUTHORITY HAS    
 TRIED TO TURN BOURNEMOUTH INTO A      
 CONFERENCE CENTRE BY BUILDING THE     
 B.I.C. (BOURNEMOUTH INTERNATIONAL     
 CENTRE).  BOURNEMOUTH IS ALSO VERY    
 POPULAR AS A RETIREMENT AREA AND THERE
 ARE MANY SENIOR CITIZENS IN THE TOWN. 
   BECAUSE OF THE TOURIST TRADE AND THE
 AGE OF MANY OF BOURNEMOUTH'S RESIDENTS
 JOBS IN THE TOWN TEND TO BE IN HOTELS,
 SHOPS AND OFFICES RATHER THAN IN      
 FACTORIES, MILLS OR DOCKS.            
                                       
                                       </content>
