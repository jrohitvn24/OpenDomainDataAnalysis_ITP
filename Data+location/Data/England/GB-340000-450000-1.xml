		<title>01Cockerham sands &amp; salt marsh</title>
		<content> This is an important ecological area, 
 a part of Morecambe Bay,and an ever   
 changing world of sand and water,     
 continually being shaped by the ebb   
 and flow of the twice daily tides. The
 bed of the bay is mainly sand and     
 silt,with nearer to the sea wall,salt 
 marsh cut by gullies and channels.The 
 area between the new sea wall and     
 the A588 road has been reclaimed for  
 farming. Although the area reclaimed  
 is only about eight per cent of the   
 block, it would be expected to have   
 some effect on the ecology of the     
 area.  Thousands of gulls,terns,      
 wildfowl and waders are drawn to the  
 area to feed and roost.Controlled     
 shooting,a pinic area in the reclaimed
 area and caravan sites on the North   
 East corner,with watersports          
 facilities, provide leisure activities
 for urban dwellers.                   </content>
