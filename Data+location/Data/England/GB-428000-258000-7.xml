		<content> Mid Warwickshire Crematorium stands on
 14 acres on the west side of Oakley   
 wood. It is administered by Warwick   
 council but also serves Stratford     
 Rugby And Banbury as they have no     
 facilities of their own. Only 40% of  
 Cremations come from Warwick district.
  Approximately 1700 cremations take   
 place per year. 6 people are employed;
 a manager, clerk, gardener, chapel    
 attendant, assistant and crematorium  
 attendant.                            
  Facilities consist of two chapels, 1 
 seating 85 and the other 20. Each     
 chapel has a Waiting Room and Vestry. 
 There is also a Chapel of Remembrance 
 containing the Book of Remembrance as 
 no other form of memorial is          
 permitted. There are Committal and    
 Cremator Rooms containing 3 gas fired 
 cremators. There are also 2 offices,  
 ancillary rooms and Manager's house.  </content>
