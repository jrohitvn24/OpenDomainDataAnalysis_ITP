		<title>07CHILDRENS FARM/LILFORD PARK</title>
		<content> This place is one of the most         
 enjoyable places for the younger      
 generation to visit. With all the     
 coaches from the city and the urban   
 areas the children can have the chance
 to get to know all the different      
 animals of the British countryside.The
 farm has a variety of animals         
 including shaggy Highland cattle,     
 wallabies, Shetland ponies, pygmy     
 goats, pigs, sheep and ducks. June is 
 the best time to visit the children's 
 farm because of the new born animals. 
                                       
 ADVENTURE PLAYGROUND/LILFORD PARK.    
                                       
 The tree house is a must for the      
 younger generation and can also       
 provide a period of relaxation for    
 the parents...
