		<title>01North of Kirton in Lindsey</title>
		<content> The area is in general bare arable    
 land with thin hedges and few trees.  
 Sloping up gently from the east it    
 drops suddenly away to give wide views
 over flat farmland to the power       
 stations on the trent.  The steep     
 western slope of this "Lincoln Cliff" 
 has a little permanent pasture some   
 good trees and five farmhouses and    
 barns.  Fishermen and wild duck use   
 the old cement works clay pits.The    
 works partly demolished is now only a 
 bagging depot through its social club 
 remains.  It's limestone quaries      
 remain a feature either side of the   
 busy scunthorpe road along the ridge. 
 To the south small businesses. Potato 
 packing, grain storage, car breaking, 
 plant hire, an agricultural chemicals 
 depot, and a caravan and garden centre
 are grouped about Kirtons Railway     
 Station (sigle line since 1982).      </content>
