		<content> From the returns to our survey, we    
 find the following breakdown of jobs  
 held by Bridgham residents:           
                                       
    Primary Occupations .... 28%       
    (Farming &amp; Forestry)               
    Secondary Occupations .. 28%       
    (Manufacturing &amp; Processsing)      
    Tertiary Occupations ... 44%       
    (Service Occupations)              
                                       
 Compared with national averages, we   
 show a low secondary return and a     
 very high primary return, due to our  
 very rural surroundings.  Apart from  
 agriculture, the Forestry Commission  
 is an important source of village     
 employment.  Thetford (7 miles) is the
 nearest industrial area of any size.  
 Those employed in tertiary occupations
 often have to travel great distances  
 to places of work, over a wide area.  </content>
