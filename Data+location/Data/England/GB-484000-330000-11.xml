		<content> On May 6th we had a Bank Holiday which
 meant that everybody had a day off    
 work.The village held a Street Market 
 in Church Street.The stalls opened at 
 10 o'clock and a lot of people came   
 from other villages.They parked their 
 cars in a field and so many came that 
 it was soon full.There was a Maypole  
 on the grass near the church and all  
 the children had a ribbon and danced  
 around it.The Royal Newton drum band  
 came and there was a May Queen who    
 arrived carried by four men.She was   
 brought in through the church gate and
 put down on the grass with her two    
 attendants.The vicars wife crowned the
 May Queen.There was crazy golf and    
 three tombola stalls.The schools      
 tombola was for soft toys all the     
 money raised to go to school          
 funds.There were refreshments in the  
 village hall.  Sally Oldfield Age 10  </content>
