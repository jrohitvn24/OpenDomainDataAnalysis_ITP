		<title>01Stourpaine &amp; Durweston area</title>
		<content>  The land is in a valley with the     
 River Stour running through it. At the
 side it is more hilly. Grass grows on 
 the flat land for cows and sheep but  
 some of the hills have woods on them. 
 The villages are Durweston and        
 Stourpaine and you can see their two  
 churches. The houses look mostly old. 
  You can see the banks where the old  
 Somerset and Dorset Railway used to   
 run.                                  
  There are two busy main roads from   
 Blandford. One is the A350 which goes 
 to Shaftesbury and the other is the   
 A357 to Sturminster Newton. They meet 
 at Durweston Bridge where there are   
 traffic lights.                       
  On Hod Hill there was an Iron Age    
 village and you can still see the     
 ditches and banks at the top.
