		<content>Bentilee Playscheme was started in 1978
,to help develop the community side of 
Willfield High School.                 
  It was also to see if it would help  
to cut down the amount of damage caused
by vandals.                            
  It is run for 2 weeks at the         
beginning of August from 10am to 12am, 
1pm to 3pm each day.Boys at Willfield  
made go-carts and small toys ready for 
the next 1979 scheme.That year 200     
children came.                         
  In 1980 so many children came that   
they were divided into 2 groups,4-9    
year olds and 10-15 year olds.That year
saw the first day trip to Drayton Manor
Park.The following year we used        
Brookhouse School,where the first      
water fight was held.Now there are     
water fights every year.There are      
also discos,painting,bikes,fancy dress 
competitions, and day trips.           </content>
