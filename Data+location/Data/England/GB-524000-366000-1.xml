		<content> Our area is south of the country town 
 of Horncastle. The nearest big towns  
 are Lincoln 21 miles away and Skegness
 20 miles. The land and roads are very 
 hilly and a car or motorbike is needed
 to get to shops etc. Although there is
 only one school in our area there are 
 a lot of village schools round about  
 that have about 100 pupils. We still  
 have the 11 plus exam which pupils    
 take in their primary school. If they 
 get a high mark they can go to a      
 grammar school otherwise they go to   
 secondary moderns. Banovallum, the    
 Roamn name for Horncastle is one of   
 these. Just outside Horncastle there  
 is a Spar shop with an adjoining      
 garage. Spar is an independent trade  
 organisation and our shop has been    
 going for 4 years &amp; employs 9 people. 
 The main produce sold is groceries eg 
 apples, potatoes, tinned food &amp; sweets</content>
