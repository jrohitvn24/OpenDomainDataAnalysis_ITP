		<content>H.M. PRISON KIRKHAM                    
                                       
The Prison just outside Kirkham was    
used in the 1940's as a Royal Air Force
station.  No planes landed there so    
they closed it down and used it as an  
open prison. Lower Lane was used as the
Officer's Quarters for the R.A.F.      
Station.  Just outside the Prison were 
Quarters built for the Officers called 
The Mede.  The hangars are now used for
a gym and store shed where they keep   
wooden items which the prisoners make. 
The prisoners grow vegetables, and     
salad foods which are sold to the      
Officers and also taken to feed        
prisoners in other prisons in addition 
feeding the inmates at Kirkham.        
Flowers are also grown giving the      
prison a look more of a nursery or     
garden centre rather than a penal      
institution.                           </content>
