		<title>09H &amp; A Trowers Food Mill</title>
		<content> At{Lower Dicker}there is a mill. The  
 company is called H &amp; A Trowers. It   
 used to make animal foods, but now it 
 just sells the animal foods that are  
 transported to the mill. The goods    
 are stored in an enormous warehouse.  
 Barley, oats, and sunflower seeds,    
 biscuits waste and fish meal were some
 of the things used to make the animal 
 food pellets. The mill itself is 106  
 years old. At the moment there are    
 five people on the work force. Two    
 people work in the warehouse and the  
 other three people work in the office 
 and go out to farms to get the orders 
 for animal foods. Before the factory  
 was built the land was used for       
 fields. The mill is now disused       
 because farmers weren't buying enough 
 food. Only four men are needed to run 
 the mill properly.
