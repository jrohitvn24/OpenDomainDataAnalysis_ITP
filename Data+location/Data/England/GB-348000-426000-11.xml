		<title>11SHOPPING</title>
		<content>In Penwortham today the shopping       
is mostly done locally.People do not   
think it is a good idea to open shops  
on Sundays because it would not be fair
on the shopkeepers to get out of bed   
and work.                              
There are lots of food shops in        
Penwortham and they are quite cheap.For
clothes we have to go out of our       
D-block and into Preston.              
The shops in Penwortham are very near  
to the houses so we can do most of our 
shopping  any time we want but most    
people shop once a week.We have two    
butchers and one supermarket so most   
people get their meat from the         
butchers.                              
The{ trade} in our D-block is fairly   
high,we get most things we need and    
anything else we can get in the nearby 
town;Preston.                          
                                       </content>
