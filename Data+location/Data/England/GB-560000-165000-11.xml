  Pitfield Drive is a quiet road       
 situated in the centre of Meopham off 
 the Wrotham Road.When first built over
 25years ago houses cost 5500,the      
 bungalows 4400.The brick built houses 
 and bungalows have tiled roofs.No     
 houses are for sale at the current    
 price of 55000.                       
  We interviewed a resident of         
 Longfield Hill who lived in a terraced
 house on the main Longfield road.The  
 housewas built 110years ago,as a      
 result of the development of the      
 railway.Many of the houses in this row
 had been abandoned and some of them   
 had been vandalized.                  
  A building survey on White Post Lane 
 showed the following:-  13-bungalows, 
 6-houses,2-shops,1-recreational.      
 90% of the buildings were bungalows.  
 90% had gardens.                      </content>
