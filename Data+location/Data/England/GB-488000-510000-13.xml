		<title>13Legends &amp; Stories, Whitby 2.</title>
		<content>  Legend says that long ago,{Whitby}was
 overun with{snakes!}Whitby folk begged
{St. Hilda}to dispose of the creatures.
 She led the snakes to the top of the  
 east cliff, cut off their heads and   
 cast them into the sea. Their bodies  
 became {ammonite fossils}which are    
 found in rocks along this coastline.  
  {Caedmon,}the father of English      
 sacred poetry, was a cowherd in{St.   
{Hilda's Anglo Saxon Monastery}on the  
 east cliff. He could not sing well and
 whenever the harp was about to be     
 passed to him he always left the      
 room.One night he dreamt that an angel
 sat beside him and asked him to sing  
 about the creation of the world. He   
 made up his own song and sang it to   
 St.Hilda the following morning. The   
 abbess was very impressed by him. He  
 became a member of the monastery and  
 turned scripture history into verse.  </content>
