		<content>   In the evening the school is used   
 as an adult education centre. There,  
 people participate in many activities 
 including badminton, art, languages   
 and mathematics.                      
                                       
   The pupils' exams are spread out and
 not all in one week as they used to   
 be.Of course public exams are at the  
 same time as the rest of the country. 
   In the lunchtimes and breaks there  
 are 28 different clubs (these are not 
 done after school because everyone    
 goes home by bus and nobody is inside 
 the school after 3.30pm).The clubs    
 include an art club,table tennis and  
 other sporting activities,bridge      
 club,rural science,ski club,chess     
 club,Duke of Edinburgh awards and     
 German conversation.                  
   Pupils come from as far as Truro and
 all parts of the Roseland Peninsula.  </content>
