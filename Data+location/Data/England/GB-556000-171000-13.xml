		<title>13Swanscombe Chalk Pits</title>
		<content>{  }The Cement Industry which began in 
 the early 19th century is still active
 at Swanscombe.  Here there are two    
 large chalk quarries which cover about
 580 acres. Clearly visible from the   
 road they are bounded to the south by 
 the Old Watling Street and bisected by
 Bean Road.  A potential hazard, they  
 are protected from the public by      
 warning notices and fences.           
 Mechanical face shovels and crushers  
 have long since replaced manual       
 methods of extraction.  Residents     
 nearby complain of dust.  Clay, the   
 other main constituent of cement, is  
 mixed with water and piped in liquid  
 state under the River Thames from     
 Essex to the Swanscombe Works.  Ground
 chalk is then mixed in to it to form a
 slurry, which is in turn piped to the 
 Northfleet plant for kiln drying and  
 the completion of the cement-making.  </content>
