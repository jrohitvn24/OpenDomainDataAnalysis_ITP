		<title>11The People Of Congleton</title>
		<content>  {Congleton}is generally made up of   
 "migrants" as we found when we        
 conducted a survey aimed at finding if
{Congleton}is actually made up         
 primarily of "Congletonions".         
  {44%}of the children surveyed were   
 born in Congleton and its surrounding 
 area.                                 
  {52%}came from other parts of the    
 United Kingdom.                       
   The remaining{4%}were from abroad.  
{2%}were from Switzerland and{2%}were  
 from New Zealand.                     
   When people were asked why they     
 moved to{Congleton}there was a mixed  
 response.                             
   The main reasons were employment,   
 family and environment.
