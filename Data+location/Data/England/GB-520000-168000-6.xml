		<title>06OFFICE BLOCKS - NEW MALDEN</title>
		<content>                                       
   In New Malden there are two large   
 office blocks which have come under   
 much criticism lately. One which is   
 next to New Malden station is unused  
 and has been arousing anger because   
 Â£1m has recently been spent on it,but 
 it has done nothing to improve its    
 prospects of being  sold or let;the   
 other is being rented.                
   The two tower blocks are opposite   
 each other and because of the open    
 space between them,it is a very windy 
 area causing a large amount of litter 
 to gather and blow up into the air.   
   It also seems wrong that so much    
 money is being spent on something     
 no-one wants,when so many people need 
 to be housed in better places.        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
