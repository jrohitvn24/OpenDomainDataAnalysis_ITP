		<content>   Housing.  The Village houses are    
 mainly made of flint and cob walls,   
 with slate roofs.  Buildings in the   
 1960s were brick and tile.  The 1970s 
 are mock Georgian design.  There are  
 still some thatch cottages but a lot  
 have been pulled down.  The old       
 cobblers shop is still visable and a  
 number of water mills up the valley   
 can still be identified.  The school  
 was build in 1859 and is a typical    
 Victorian building.                   
 2. Childrens Games.  At present the   
 children play games such as Green     
 Gates where you have to do hand stands
 and the last one to fall is the       
 winner.  Sardines, where they all pack
 to gether tightly as many as they can.
 Stuck in the Tolet Pipe, a form of    
 Hide-and-Seek, and other games with   
 names like Little Pony, Flea Busters, 
 Piggy Banks, Stunt men and Superbaby. </content>
