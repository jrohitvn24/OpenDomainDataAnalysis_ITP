		<title>06LIVING IN BISHOPS WALTHAM</title>
		<content>   I quite like living in Bishops      
 Waltham as there is a lot of open     
 spaces around. I also like it because 
 I live in a nice house with a fair    
 sized garden.                         
   The houses where I live are old -   
 about 83 years old - so there is      
 plenty of space around. However five  
 of the fields have been built on with 
 small houses and now there is a lot of
 traffic.                              
   I would like to see less people in  
 the area so that housing and unemploy-
 ment would go down. The population is 
 now around 4000. I would like this    
 figure to be about 1500.              
   Near my house there is a very       
 straight Roman road called{Tangier    
{Lane.}The pond is quite interesting   
 and if you are a keen fisherman it is 
 just the place for you.
