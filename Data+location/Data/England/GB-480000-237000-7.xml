		<title>07HOUSES IN MILTON KEYNES</title>
		<content> Houses in Milton Keynes vary from each
 estate. The house I live in has four  
 bedrooms and the sort of other rooms  
 you expect to find in a house, Our    
 back garden is quite big, it has a    
 pattio and steps leading onto a path, 
 and another going onto the grass, We  
 also have in our back garden a shed   
 which we made ourselves.Next door to  
 us is a Bungalow, in its back garden  
 gnomes are sitting everywhere you     
 look.The bunglow inside is quite big, 
 with two bedrooms, a kitchen etc.at   
 the end of our bit of road is a house 
 especially made for the disabled.     
 inside theres the main bedroom down   
 stairs which is next to the bathroom, 
 the bathroom is filled with the newest
 things to help the disabled person.   
 the garden is big with a small pattio 
 and a greenhouse built onto the back  
 door.                                 </content>
