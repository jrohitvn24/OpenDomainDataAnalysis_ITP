		<content> We walked to Romsley to start our     
 survey. We used the footpath that went
 across fields. In many places it was  
 hard to find as farmers often plough  
 the paths up. As we had a large group 
 we sent out scouts to find out where  
 the footpath went. We noticed wheat,  
 barley and oats in the fields. In one 
 field of grass there was an electric  
 fence. This was used to control cattle
 grazing. On the outskirts of Romsley  
 was a caravan park. We could not go in
 as you need membership to do this, but
 we asked some questions of the owner. 
 We found out that many people stay    
 here even though it is not a tourist  
 area. Very often people stay here for 
 one night as Romsley is close to the  
 M5 and people break their journeys    
 here.
