		<content> For its size, Otley has a wide variety
 of services. It has its own Police    
 Station, Law Courts,and  Fire Station,
 although there is no Ambulance        
 Station. There is an Information      
 Office and a Civic Centre where local 
 events are held. At the Auction Mart  
 on the bank of the river there are    
 weekly sales of farm animals and      
 equipment.                            
 The shops include five chain stores   
 selling general foods and household   
 goods. There are three travel agents, 
 and five large garages selling new    
 cars, as well as quite a few repair   
 garages. In summer, boats can be hired
 to row on the river, and there is an  
 open-air swimming pool. Old gravel    
 pits to the east of the town are used 
 now for sailing small boats.
