		<content> A gentleman who has lived for 73 years
 in the village of Hemingbrough has    
 described some of his memories to a   
 group of 11_year_olds.                
     I have lived in 6 different houses
 one of which was an old Public House  
 called The Half Moon which stood      
 opposite St Mary's church and no      
 longer exists.                        
 When the new road, A63, was cut       
 through Northfield in 1929 I bought a 
 piece of new land and built a new     
 house at the corner where the petrol  
 station now stands.                   
 Over the years I have owned various   
 pieces of land and farmed in the      
 village. I employed labourers and     
 seasonal workers and had working      
 horses before the age of machinery.   
 In 1916 I was the first person in     
 Hemingbrough to own a motor car,a     
 Briton.                               </content>
