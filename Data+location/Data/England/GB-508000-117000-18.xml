		<content>  In our survey of adults and children 
 we asked them what they liked and did 
 not like about living in W.Chilt.Boys 
 and girls and grown ups too all chose 
 the{peacefulness}and the{countryside  
 as the most important things. There   
 are so many trees and large gardens in
 the village and fields and farms near 
 by.The children also liked living here
 because their{friends}were near them. 
  Few of the girls could think of any- 
 thing that they didn't like.Some would
 like{more clubs}others didn't like the
{farm smells!}The boys wanted more     
{clubs}and{shops}but{less school!

 most like to change. Most mums said   
{'nothing'}others wanted{no more houses
{better bus service}and{more activities
 for children.The dads added,{fewer new
{comers,better paths,roads and village 
{hall}and everyone to have a{bathroom! </content>
