		<title>14TRANSPORT THROUGH CROSSGATES</title>
		<content> Near the Arndale Centre is{Crossgates 
{railway station.}The line is a very   
 old one, the first one being built in 
 1834. The railway line was originally 
 built to link Leeds with the port of  
 Hull via Selby to facilitate the      
 transport of goods to the new and     
 growing industrial town of Leeds.     
 Nowadays the station is useful for    
 office workers and other{commuters}who
 travel daily to the centre of Leeds.  
                                       
 The main road from Leeds to Selby is  
 even older than the railway. This     
 road, the{A63,}runs straight up the   
 hill through Whitkirk _ the railway   
 goes round the hill through           
 Crossgates _ and years ago was a{toll 
{road.}Nowadays it is still a busy     
 road, but much of the heavy traffic   
 heading for Hull uses the M62 instead.
