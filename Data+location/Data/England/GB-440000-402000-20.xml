		<title>20The Doctor's Surgery</title>
		<content>    One day I went to Doctor Bell's    
 surgery.  I like Doctor Bell he is a  
 nice man to go to.  Doctor Bell lives 
 in a big house, he has a surgery at   
 his house.  I was sick and Doctor Bell
 gave me some medicine.  It was        
 Saturday, he is at work on Saturdays. 
 You can go in one of the rooms to talk
 to him.                               
    I went to Doctor Bell's and at     
 first I thought the injection was not 
 going to hurt but it did, and I cried 
 and he let me take the needle home.   
 When I got home I played with it with 
 Julie, Joanne and Louise.  When you go
 in the surgery you see a long seat at 
 the left side and there is a long seat
 at the right side and you have to wait
 a long time.  He has an owl on his    
 desk and it blinks at you and once he 
 tickled me.                           
                                       </content>
