		<title>12Interview-Thetford farmer.</title>
		<content> This farmer lives on Thetford         
 Farm.Square 1115 on the map.He rents  
 530 acres of land.In the last 20 years
 his men have gone down from 12 to     
 3,but now he has 8 tractors and uses  
 chemicals.He has a lot of machinery.He
 is a mixed arable farmer which means  
 that he grows crops.He grows          
 potatoes,wheat,barley sugar beet and  
 also daffodils.As well he has about 60
 bullocks a year to fatten up for      
 beef.On his land there are 3          
 spinneys.He thinks the land is good   
 because it is flat,the soil is easy to
 work on and there is not much rain.His
 biggest problem is in the summer when 
 there is not enough rain.In his       
 leisure time he plays golf.
