		<content> Religion; St.Erth Church              
       The Font includes the only      
 Norman stonework in the Church.  This 
 is its bowl, which was discovered     
 upside down in the South Aisle floor  
 during the l873 rebuilding. It is     
 restored to its proper use, mounted on
 a modern base.                        
       In l9l2, the eastern part of the
 South Aisle was reconstructed and     
 furnished as the Lady Chapel by Mrs   
 J.Hawkins, widow of Christopher       
 Hawkins the last of the Hawkins       
 family, of Trewithern and Trewinnard. 
 It is generally known as Trewinnard   
 Chapel. The magnificent screen in the 
 traditional pattern has beautiful     
 carvings. The interesting bench - ends
 include one of Bishop Stubbs, the     
 Bishop of Truro at the time.
