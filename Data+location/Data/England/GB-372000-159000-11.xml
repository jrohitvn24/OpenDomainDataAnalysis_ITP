		<content> BATH SPA station handles about 2,500  
 passengers a day. The station is on an
 important route between Bristol and   
 London. The line was constructed by   
 I.K.BRUNEL as was the station. Mnay   
 people are able to commute tothe city 
 from the West Country because of the  
 intoduction of the HST which has      
 brought travelling time down to 1 hour
 25 mins.                              
 The station became important because  
 of the SPA that it served and during  
 Victorian times many people travelled 
 to BATH to take the waters. The       
 station is extremely busy but could do
 with some investment to look after the
 comfort of passengers.
