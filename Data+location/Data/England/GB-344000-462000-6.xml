		<title>06Wave Reflection Wall</title>
		<content> The Wave Reflection Wall was built in 
 Morecambe between 1982 and 1984. There
 had been a succession of floods over  
 the years causing a considerable      
 amount of damage. The last floods     
 occured in 1983 and 1977. The floods  
 were caused by a coming together of   
 high winds, high seas and heavy rain  
 and resulted in low lying areas up to 
 a mile from the sea front being       
 flooded. During the last flood huge   
 chunks of the promenade wall were     
 gouged out, shelters were destroyed   
 and fishing boats damaged or          
 destroyed. One boat was flung right   
 across the promenade giving           
 overwhelming evidence of the power of 
 nature. After the 1977 flood the      
 decision was made to build a new sea  
 wall. The idea and design for the wave
 reflection wall came from the city    
 engineer Mr. Norman Shadwell.         </content>
