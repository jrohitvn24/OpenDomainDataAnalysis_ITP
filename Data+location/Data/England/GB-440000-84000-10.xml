		<title>10A Lady's Life in Calbourne</title>
		<content> As{MIDDLE AGED WOMEN}living in the    
 village of Calbourne, we find village 
 life very active with a good communtiy
 spirit.  Most people have the use of a
 car and many women can drive as well  
 as men.  Heating is by Electricity,   
 Solid fuel or Calor gas.  Most women  
 have labour saving homes, the majority
 have the telephone, television and    
 electrical appliances to aid with     
 cleaning and cooking.  So with more   
 free time many women are involved in  
 local activities, fund raising for    
 the Church, Womens Institute and      
 Recreation Centre. Many women who work
 outside the home do Part time.  The   
 bus service is two hourly to nearest  
 town. Most women visit Town once a    
 week for shopping, occasionally they  
 cross to the mainland.  Hobbies and   
 leisure activities include sewing,    
 knitting, walking and flower arranging</content>
