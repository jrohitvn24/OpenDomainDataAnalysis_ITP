		<title>12Saighton Grange &amp; grounds.</title>
		<content> The existing building of Saighton     
 Grange,built by the Grosvenor family, 
 dates from the 1850s but has a tower  
 dated 1490 (when Benedictine monks    
 owned it).Hence the name of the       
 secondary school there now is Abbey-  
 gate College.This fee-paying private  
 school has 300 pupils aged from 11 to 
 18 years,coming from a wide area,often
 by car but there is also a twice daily
 school bus starting in Churton &amp;      
 serving the Saighton primary school as
 well as 2 Chester schools.            
 In the grounds the Grosvenors built a 
 private chapel for the then,invalided,
 Lady Mary Grosvenor which is now used 
 each month by Saighton village.       
 There is also a water tower,said to be
 haunted,which takes water from the    
 mains supply &amp; stores it for the      
 village.
