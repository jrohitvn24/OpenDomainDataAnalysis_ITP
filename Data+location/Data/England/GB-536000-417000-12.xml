		<title>12WINDMILL-A RUIN</title>
		<content>{HOLDERNESS MILLS}Easington village    
 like many in Holderness had its own   
 windmill (there are no running streams
 to provide power for watermills in    
 these flat lands but there were plenty
 of strong windy days to push the sails
 round).                               
{MILL TYPE}The mill was the "Tower     
  Mill" type and had four white sails. 
 It was painted black and had a white  
 balcony surrounding the first storey. 
 The mill was used to grind grain.     
{MILLERS.}In 1874 the millers were John
 and Miriam Cuthbert whose daughters   
 were traginally killed following an   
 accident at the Mill.Their graves are 
 in the church cemetery with an        
 interesting tombstone.                
{ REMAINS}The mill is now a ruin with  
 only the tower reduced in height      
 remaining as a storeshed.
