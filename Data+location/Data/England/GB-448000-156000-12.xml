		<title>12FARMING IN SYDMONTON</title>
		<content> THE MAIN CROPS ARE WHEAT &amp; BARLEY. THE
 HEDGES HAVE BEEN TAKEN OUT IN THE     
 LOWER FIELDS TO MAKE IT EASIER WORK   
 FOR THE LARGE COMBINES USED THESE     
 DAYS. ABOUT A THIRD OF THE AREA IS    
 USED FOR GRAZING CATTLE AND SHEEP.    
 SHEEP ARE NOW COMING BACK IN QUANTITY.
 THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT AREA IN THE     
 GREAT DAYS OF THE WOOLEN TRADE - 15th 
 CENTURY- WITH MANY LARGE FLOCKS ON THE
 DOWNS. CATTLE ARE NOT GENERALLY KEPT, 
 ALTHOUGH SOME MAY BE GRAZED FOR A     
 SHORT PERIOD. THE WOODS AT FOSSICKS   
 ARE USED FOR TIMBER AND NEW PLANTINGS 
 HAVE BEEN MADE.ALSO BELOW NUTHANGER   
 THERE IS A NEW SPINNEY OF MIXED TREES.
 THERE IS A SMALL HOLDING CALLED       
 BISHOPS HILL OF 16 ACRES USED FOR PIGS
 &amp; CATTLE. HALF THE LAND IS OWNED BY   
 PRUDENTIAL ASSURANCE AND MANAGED BY   
 TWO FARMERS. ONLY ONE FARMER IN THE   
 AREA OWNS HIS OWN LAND.               </content>
