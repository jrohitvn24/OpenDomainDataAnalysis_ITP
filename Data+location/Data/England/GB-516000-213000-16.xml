		<content> On 22/5/85 Carla, Mark and I went     
 down to the village.My mum Mrs.Smith  
 took us down there.I went into the    
 shoe shop and asked the lady that     
 worked there some                     
 questions.Afterward Carla asked the   
 lady in the hairdressers some         
 questions she had made up.When she    
 had finished we                       
 went out of the shop and Mark         
 interviewed people in the             
 village.Then Mark asked ten people    
 questions about Wheathampstead.After  
 that we all walked back to school to  
 have our dinner.After our dinner we   
 had to write about what happened down 
 the village and then we drew some     
 pictures of the view in Wheathampstead
 village.Then we typed it out onto the 
 computer. While we were in the village
 we asked people a variety of questions
 about fashion and what they wore.     </content>
