		<title>16Traffic in Sandwich</title>
		<content>   The town of Sandwich still retains  
its Mediaeval street pattern. The two  
main route ways, Thanet to Deal, and   
Canterbury to Sandwich, still meet in  
the town centre causing severe traffic 
congestion, noise and pollution in the 
narrow streets. A badly needed by-pass,
north-south was completed in 1980 which
has reduced the traffic congestion in  
the town considerably. Until the       
completion of this by-pass nearly 75%  
of all traffic was just passing        
through.                               
   The congestion was further confused 
by the presence of a toll bridge to the
north of Sandwich over the River Stour.
The toll was 5p for cars. This toll was
brought to an end when , in 1974,      
Sandwich lost its Borough Council      
status to Dover. However over the years
the toll had paid for the extension to 
the Guildhall which was opened in 1973.</content>
