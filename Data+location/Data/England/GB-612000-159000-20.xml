		<title>20SUMMING UP...AND THANKS.</title>
		<content>This then is our 3x4 km. D Block...    
mainly rural with agricultural land    
and woodland. The farms have remained  
substantially unchanged through the    
years with cereal crops,soft fruit and 
hops.Several farms now feature "Pick   
your own" fruit.There are 2 villages,  
a residential area on the outskirts of 
Canterbury,a small industrial estate,3 
Conservation areas,and 7 Educational   
establishments.                        
Many thanks to the children and parents
of Miss Korbelik's and Mrs Stokes's    
classes,who went out and about         
conducting interviews and looking at   
the land.Thanks also to the people who 
kindly gave their time to be           
interviewed...the Head teachers,       
Reserve Wardens,St. Stephens residents,
and Tyler Hill villagers.              
The photographs were taken by Mrs.     
B.Stokes, between May &amp; July 1985      </content>
