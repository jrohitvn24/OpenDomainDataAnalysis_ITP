		<content> We went first around the First        
 and                                   
 Middle schools with our questionnaire,
 and then around the villagers of      
 Pinvin. We asked them mainly about    
{sporting activities.                  
    Amongst the younger generation by  
 far the most popular activity is      
{swimming.}The nearest pool is in      
 Pershore where the staff are very keen
 to run special courses and clubs for  
 children. This is an excellent amenity
 to have close by, and as such it is   
 very well used.                       
    In the absence of other sports     
 amenities children and adults alike   
 seem to watch a great deal of         
{television.}Apart from this, adults   
 and elderly people tend to enjoy      
{gardening}in their spare time. Some   
 children were even recorded as saying 
 that they did too !                   </content>
