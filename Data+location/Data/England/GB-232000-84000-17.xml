		<title>17     RAILWAY REVIVAL</title>
		<content> Ever since the{Great Western}and{     
{Southern}lines were closed here in    
 October 1966,there has been an effort 
 to retain over 2 miles of the section 
 from Launceston to Egloskerry.We      
 enjoyed the ride along the 60 cm gauge
 track in an open_sided coach drawn by 
 the{steam engine}'Lilian'.She was     
 built in 1883 in Leeds and was rescued
 after being at Penryhn slate quarry in
 North Wales in 1964 by the present    
 owner and railway enthusiast.He showed
 us the fire_box which generated heat  
 to boil water which produced the{steam
 which was controlled by valves and was
 the driving power.Points and coupling 
 the carriages still work as they did  
 originally.From the{cutting,}stone had
 been used for the{embankment.}The     
 track goes under the{road bridge }and 
 the aqueduct which took water from the
 River Kensey to the{Town Mills.       </content>
