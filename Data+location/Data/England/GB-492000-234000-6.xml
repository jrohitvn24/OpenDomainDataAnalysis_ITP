		<content>   At school I play Stuck in the Mud   
 and It. At home I play Catch in the   
 garden and football with Mummy and    
 Clair.  Inside at night I play        
 Draughts, Chess, Fantasy Forest, Pairs
 and Snap. Sometimes I play Witches and
 Wizards. I often play Catch with Simon
 and we catch the girls and Simon puts 
 them into his pretend oven and cooks  
 them, then he pretends to eat         
 them.(James)                          
                                       
   I like playing Pontoon with Mum, Dad
 and Matthew.  Matthew doesn't know how
 to play it so Dad helps him and we    
 play Bingo and Snakes and Ladders. I  
 like playing football and cricket in  
 the field opposite my house.(Daniel)
