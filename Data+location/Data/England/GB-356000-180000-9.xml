		<title>09Willie, Patchway's Clown</title>
		<content>   Willie the Clown's real name is     
 Stephen William Blaber.  He was born  
 in Eastbourne in 1921.  He worked     
 first on a farm at Gaunts Earthcott,  
 near Patchway, and then came to       
 Patchway in 1954.  He then worked on  
 the dustbin lorry for 16 years.       
   Afterwards he became a roadsweeper, 
 sweeping up the rubbish. He keeps     
 Patchway very clean.  He dressed up as
 a clown and entertained people in     
 hospital, old people homes, schools   
 and play schools, raising lots of     
 money for charity.  He helps old      
 people by making them laugh and feel  
 better, and by doing their shopping   
 and things like that.  He visits them 
 every morning to see if they are      
 allright. When Lady Diana and Prince  
 Charles got married we had a street   
 party and we invited Willie. He came  
 in a clowns outfit with a big comb.   </content>
