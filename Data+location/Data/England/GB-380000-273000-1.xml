		<title>01Kidderminster, Physical</title>
		<content> The area, which is situated to the SSW
 of the carpet manufacturing town of{  
 Kidderminster, is divided into three  
 approximately equal zones: dry        
 heathland, residential and industrial.
 The western part is substantially dry 
 heathland with some agriculture and is
 bordered on the northern side by the  
 West Midland Safari Park and crossed  
 by the Severn Valley Railway. The     
 industrial areas are largely in the SE
 and are mostly contained within three 
 distinct trading/industrial estates.  
 Running almost parallel to each other 
 are the Staffordshire and             
 Worcestershire Canal, which once      
 carried pottery form Staffordshire to 
 the South and the Stour, a minor      
 tributary of the River Severn. In the 
 extreme SE corner is the Summerfield  
 Research Station which does rocket    
 development work and occupies 1 sq.km.</content>
