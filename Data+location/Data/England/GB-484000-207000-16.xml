		<title>16The Wendover Bypass 1988/9</title>
		<content>                                       
A bypass for Wendover, first proposed  
in 1937, has recently been approved. An
exhibition to explain the proposals was
held in Wendover in April 1985 and     
after public consultation, the "Blue   
Route" has been chosen. This plan      
avoids the need for re-routing the     
railway line and building a new        
station.                               
 The projected cost to date is 5.4     
million pounds. It is estimated that   
22.1 acres of agricultural land will   
be claimed and the 3.8 kms. route will 
require 5 new bridges.                 
   Inspite of popular approval of the  
scheme, the trade and accessibility of 
several local businesses will be       
adversely affected.
