		<content> To find out more about our area we    
 asked some questions of the people who
 live here.We asked which facilities   
 they used,whether they had to travel  
 to work,how long they had lived here  
 and what they thought of the changes  
 that have happened recently.We found  
 that most people have not lived in the
 vilages for very long but most of the 
 farms had been in the same family for 
 generations.Most people used the      
 village shop and post office,and used 
 the local milkman.Many people were not
 happy with the services in the        
 village,expecialy the buses which     
 they thought were expensive and       
 infrequent.Although Channings Wood    
 prison gives work to a lot of people  
 in the area,most people work outside  
 the village.
