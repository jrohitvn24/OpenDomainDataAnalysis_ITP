		<content> Being a rural community many of the   
 residents spend much of their free    
 time gardening.There are no clubs in  
 the village to which they can belong. 
 Other than additional footpaths the   
 residents are more than happy with the
 village as it is. The younger children
 of the community would like a play    
 ground area as there is no where for  
 them to play.                         
 Housing wiyhin the village is either  
 concil or belongs to the estate. Very 
 few houses are privately owned. It is 
 felt that if ground was released by   
 the Earl of Yarborough for private    
 development the size of the village   
 would increase dramatically. Many of  
 the men folk are employed on the      
 estate. Others are employed in various
 occupations either in Grimsby,Brigg,  
 or Immingham.                         
                                       </content>
