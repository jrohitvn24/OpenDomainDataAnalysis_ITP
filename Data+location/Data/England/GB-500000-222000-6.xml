		<title>06A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A NURSE</title>
		<content>                                       
 I woke at 7am,and got all my gear     
 together.Had my breakfast and some    
 coffee then set of for work.Had to be 
 there by 8.15am.My name is Nurse      
 Chandler,I am a theatre nurse at the  
 L &amp; D.First I have to get into my     
 theatre clothes,blue trousers,blue    
 jumper,a hat to keep my hair in and a 
 mask to see that the patient does not 
 catch my germs.Today,the first        
 patient had fallen off her motorbike  
 and was seriously injured.She was     
 taken into the operating theatre.We   
 saw that she had broken her leg but   
 had stones under her skin.The         
 anaesthetic put her to sleep while we 
 took out the stones.We all worked as a
 team the doctors and nurses           
 together,some are student nurses who I
 am training.It took over 5 hours,and I
 left work at about 3.30pm.            </content>
