		<content> The block comprises open land;either  
 arable or grazing.The few dwellings   
 are farms,manor houses,and isolated   
 cottages or small houses,some of which
 were lodges for the manors.The manors 
 and farms are privately owned,except  
 for Offley Grange,and Wellbury which  
 is now a Boys' Home run by a charity. 
 There are villages nearby;Offley,     
 Pirton and Lilley.The towns of Hitchin
 and Luton are less than 10 miles away.

 Domesday entry for Wellbury.
