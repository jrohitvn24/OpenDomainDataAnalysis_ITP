		<title>09By the River Arrow in June</title>
		<content>      Walking by the River Arrow you   
 hear birds singing, the wind gently   
 blowing through the trees and the     
 river trickling along, after tumbling 
 over a small waterfall. You can see a 
 black bridge and its reflection in the
 water. A disused railway track goes   
 over the bridge. People take their    
 dogs for walks along there and some go
 jogging in their tracksuits. You see  
 people fishing in the river, sitting  
 among many different wild flowers and 
 grasses. Across the river, on the     
 Grammar School playing field, you may 
 hear children's voices as they play   
 cricket, or hockey and rugby in       
 winter. If you walk on upstream you   
 pass a market garden with fields full 
 of lettuce. The river path then goes  
 through a lot of very tall nettles and
 comes out in pasture land by a weir.  
 Take your wellies and have a good day!</content>
