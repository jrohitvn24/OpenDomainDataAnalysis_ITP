		<title>11THE WETLANDS AND DRAINAGE</title>
		<content> Around{Moss and Fenwick}in 1850's     
 there was a lot of flooding. The      
 ground is flat and the soil is clay   
 which means the water can not drain   
 away. The land is only 5 feet above   
 sea level. It was no use for farming. 
 Then they started a{drainage system   
 which continues to the present day.   
 They dug the ground up and put pipes  
 in. Also the{River Went}used to flood 
 a lot in winter so they got rid of the
 old course and changed the embankments
 so they were a lot higher so the water
 would not flood. One area is still    
{wet land}but this is going to be      
 drained in the next few years.
