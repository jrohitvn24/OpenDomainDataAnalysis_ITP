		<content> Round here there are not many buses.  
 For instance,in{Shapwick}there are    
 only two public buses per day,one at  
 10.20a.m. and one at 3.05p.m.Also     
 there are private buses taking people 
 to school,work,college and the army.  
 Altogether there are twelve private   
 buses. People at school have a choice 
 of transport to school, they can      
 either go by bike,bus or car.The      
 local children either walk or go by   
 bike.A bike is a two wheeled vehicle  
 powered by pedals.It is not electric! 
 There are no taxi services in         
 Shapwick,but they do take people to   
 the{Shapwick Hotel.}No lorries over 30
 tons are allowed in Shapwick, for they
 might crack the road.Many of the      
 farmers in Shapwick use modern farm   
 vehicles, like tractors and combine   
 harvesters to help them with their    
 work in the fields.                   </content>
