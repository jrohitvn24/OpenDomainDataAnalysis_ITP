		<title>08CALLINGTON ROADS &amp; RAILWAYS</title>
		<content> The A39O &amp; A388 roads passing through 
 Callington are{l8C turnpikes}which    
 have had few improvements apart from  
 resurfacing. Several turnpike         
 milestones still survive. One in      
 Saltash Rd gives the distance to      
 SALTASH PASSAGE, the old{ferry        
{terminal.}Another , at Bushlakes, is  
 cut diagonally to indicate the        
 Horsebridge road branching from the   
 road to Tavistock.                    
{Public transport}along these roads is 
 infrequent. Several buses a day ply   
 between Plymouth and Launceston but   
 only once a week from Harrowbarrow    
 into Callington or from Callington to 
 Tavistock.                            
 The{railway line}closed in l965. All  
 that remains in the block is Luckett  
 Station, now converted to a private   
 house.                                
                                       </content>
