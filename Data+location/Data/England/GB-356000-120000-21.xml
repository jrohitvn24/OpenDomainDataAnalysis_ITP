<title>21The house where I was born</title>
<content>

Most of the Illingworth children were born in the Manor House, which was bought for a song by my father, Philip Illingworth, after the war, with 1,000 pounds taken off the asking price because of the ghost, and a further 1,000 pounds chopped off because of the church bells!!!  I don't remember the ghost being green, however, I'm sure she was grey!   &lt;br />
