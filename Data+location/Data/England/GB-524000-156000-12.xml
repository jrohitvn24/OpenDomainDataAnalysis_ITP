		<content> The kids are dancing on the green,to a
 sound like a monster in pain.         
 The birds are flying from the trees,  
 And the squirrels are running from    
 their homes abandoning their nuts,    
 which were gathered to store for the  
 coming Winter cold.                   
 The litter is strewn around as if a   
 bird had shed its feathers on the     
 ground below.                         
 And in a nearby field, the corn sways 
 like waves on the sea.                
 And the kids are dancing on the green 
 to music and lights that are red and  
 green.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
