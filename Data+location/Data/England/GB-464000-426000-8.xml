		<content> We interviewed two farmers whose      
 families have farmed in the area for  
 over 50 years. They have very         
 different ways of farming even though 
 they have about the same acre-age. The
 first uses most of his land for arable
 farming, planting wheat, barley, sugar
 beet, peas and oilseed rape. He       
 retains about 30 acres for bullocks   
 which he buys in annually and sells as
 fatstock. He has removed a number of  
 hedges to make larger expanses of     
 land, though he has planted copses of 
 deciduous trees to give shade to his  
 cattle. The second farmer also divides
 his land between livestock and arable 
 but this is nearer to half and half.  
 He grows oats, barley, oilseed rape   
 and swede. He retains large areas of  
 traditional meadow land where he      
 grazes cattle, some of which he breeds
 and some of which is sold for beef.   </content>
