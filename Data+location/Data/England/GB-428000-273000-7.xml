		<title>07MR. SWAIN'S NURSERY</title>
		<content>Mr. Swain owns a 2 acre nursery which  
sells plants and ornaments. On a busy  
day he can have up to 200 customers and
on a bad day he wouldn't have any      
customers. He runs the nursery on his  
own with a few weekend helpers. There  
are 3 greenhouses where he propogates  
the plants. He works a 7 day week and  
doesn't get a real holiday apart from  
when he takes the children away for two
weeks in the summer.His plants range in
size and from a few pence to 15 pounds 
for a magnolia. He has small geraniums 
and big shrubs but he doesn't have a   
favourite plant. Most of his           
competition comes from Coventry. He had
very strong feelings about the coal    
mine being on his doorstep because he  
thught that after what he had built up 
the coal mine wouldn't do him any good.
