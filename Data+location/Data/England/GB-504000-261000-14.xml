		<title>14RISELEY FEAST</title>
		<content>      Special services,games in the    
 vicarage garden,tea and cakes for the 
 Sunday school children,cricket        
 matches,the village full of visitors  
 with swinging boats and amusements for
 their pleasure - these were the       
 activites that characterised Riseley's
 feast a hundred years ago,a time of   
 merry making,thanksgiving and         
 re-dedication held on the weekend     
 following St. Mary Magdalen's Day     
 (July 22).  In the recent years,the   
 feast has largely ignored,but there is
 a move now to restore this old        
 tradition.  Last year a succesful     
 picnic was held for the Sunday school 
 children.  This year a special service
 is planned in All Saints Church,      
 including the traditional prize-giving
 to Sunday school children,followed by 
 a family lunch and games in the new   
 vicarage garden.                      </content>
