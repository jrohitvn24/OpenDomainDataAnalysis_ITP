		<content> In the 300 acres of meadowland known  
 as Beading Brooks rare plants are     
 found. The reed warbler has been seen 
 here and on the Downs, larks, hawks   
 and many other birds are to be found. 
 In the weald there have been          
 complaints from residents of side     
 effects of crop spraying, some sore   
 throats and sickness. There has been  
 unsympathetic drainage in Beeding     
 Brooks this year by choosing the wrong
 months and thereby disturbing wildlife
 Motorcross takes place at the rear of 
 Golding Barn Farm which considerably  
 scars the Downland landscape. Stubble 
 burning is also unpopular with the    
 walkers.
