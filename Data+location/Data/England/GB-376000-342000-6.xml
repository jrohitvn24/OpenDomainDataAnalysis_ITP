		<title>06MUSIC IN SCHOOL</title>
		<content>  In 1950, Mr. Bailey became headmaster
of the school, fostering an interest in
music which still continues today. He  
encouraged all children to take part in
music, and began to learn to play the  
violin with his older pupils.          
    The Country Dance Festival became  
an annual event, parents gathering with
their children to enjoy many popular   
folk dances. Mr. Bailey also founded a 
festival, held every two years, when   
schools from outlying districts joined 
together for a day, in order to sing.  
Because of the closure of small schools
this festival no longer exists, though 
Sir John Offley School presents a      
"Musical Evening" each year, in which  
children are encouraged to take part to
perform for their parents. The school  
has a choir,a recorder group,a guitar  
group, and a number of children play   
woodwind,brass,strings,and keyboards.  </content>
