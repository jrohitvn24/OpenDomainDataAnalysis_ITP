		<content> Many residences within the area are   
 old cottages made from a variety of   
 materials. Many are stone, some are   
 cob and thatched and a common feature 
 is the old roofs of pantiles made from
 Bridgwater clay. Several old places   
 still retain their inglenook          
 fireplaces and beams but have been    
 modernised to provide extra facilities
 such as bathrooms.                    
 The majority of houses are privately  
 owned. There are some council houses  
 which are rented. A few people live in
 tythe cottages. With the recent growth
 of population many new homes have been
 built, and consequently the majority  
 of dwellings in this area are         
 constructed from brick under tiled    
 roofs.
