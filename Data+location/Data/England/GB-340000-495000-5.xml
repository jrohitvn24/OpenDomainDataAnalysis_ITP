		<content>{       Low Flying Aircraft.}          
 We have a lot of low flying aircraft  
 over{Bowness}and{Windermere.}They are 
 all{Military Aircraft.}They are       
 supposed to fly no lower than{250ft   
 but local people believe that they fly
 much lower than that. Many complaints 
 have been made particularly by local  
 farmers who have had{stock frightened 
 by these aircraft. Low flying aircraft
 which are accepted by the local people
 are a){Air Sea Rescue}helicopters used
 in mountain rescues b) the helicopters
 used by farmers to transport{feed}into
 the fells for their sheep and c) the  
 helicopters used by the{National Trust
 to carry building materials to repair 
 the badly eroded footpaths on the     
 fells.
