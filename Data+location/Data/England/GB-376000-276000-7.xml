		<content>      Trimpley Village Hall is a most  
 important amenity in an area without a
 school or shop where people may meet  
 and get to know their neighbours.Local
 support has been shown by the raising 
 of Â£36,000 in the past 3 years for the
 improvement of fabric and facilities, 
 some as grants from local councils but
 most from monthly fund-raising events 
 such as dances,meals,raffles,quizzes, 
 sponsored events and barBQs. It is    
 used regularly by the Parish Council, 
 Women's Institute, Keep Fit, and the  
 Men's Club which rents one of the two 
 large rooms permanently and has a     
 separate Management Committee.        
      The attractive brick building    
 which can seat 70 can be hired for    
 wedding receptions etc.,and is used on
 most weekends in the Summer. Charges  
 are:Â£2 per hour or Â£10 for Friday or  
 Saturday evenings, Â£8 other evenings. </content>
