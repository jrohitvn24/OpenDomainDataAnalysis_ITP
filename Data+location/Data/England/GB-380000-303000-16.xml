 We in Albrighton regard ourselves as  
 very lucky.We all have gardens in     
 which to play and plenty of open      
 spaces to exercise our pets.          
  We have no high-rise tower blocks    
 and very few flats.Some flats are     
 found over the shops and in two small 
 developments where provision is made  
 for the elderly.                      
  Approximately a quarter of the houses
 are semi-detached or terraced council 
 owned homes and a small proportion are
 terraced houses occupied by R.A.F.    
 personnel stationed at Cosford.The    
 rest are privately owned semis or     
 detached houses and bungalows.It is   
 unlikely that there will be any       
 further housing development in the    
 area.                                 
  Most of the surrounding farms are    
 owner occupied.                       </content>
