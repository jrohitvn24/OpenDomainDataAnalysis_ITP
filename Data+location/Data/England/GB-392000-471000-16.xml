		<title>16BIRDS IN LITTONDALE</title>
		<content>   Apart from the usual common birds   
 like finches, tits, thrushes,         
 sparrows, and wrens, Littondale has   
 some quite rare resident birds as     
 well as summer and winter visitors.   
 Among the residents are the dippers   
 and herons, which can be seen near the
 river, and very occasionally the      
 kingfisher.   Equally rare residents  
 are barn owls, though the tawny and   
 little owl are fairly frequently seen.
   Spring brings goosander and         
 oystercatcher, cuckoo, curlew,        
 lapwing, nuthatch, treecreeper, swift 
 and swallow.                          
   In winter flocks of fieldfares are  
 regularly seen and sometimes the      
 redwing.  In a bad winter the ring    
 ouzel, which usually inhabits the     
 higher ground, comes down to the      
 valley bottom. Seagulls, especially   
 the black-headed gull visit the Dale. </content>
