		<content> Although Bexhill lies on the sunny    
 south coast, it is more thought of as 
 a retirement haven for over 65's and  
 not as a prospering holiday{resort.}  
 There is poor entertainment but a     
 refreshment to the weary traveller is 
 the{De La Warr Pavilion}on the        
 seafront. There are not many{amusement
{arcades}to accomodate the young video 
 enthusiast and this confirms the idea 
 of Bexhill being a haven for the old. 
 The{hotel industry}has almost         
 completely died in Bexhill. Once upon 
 a time, many big and grand hotels     
 lined the Victorian seafront and grand
 people came on their little sojourns  
 for the quietness and simple scenery  
 of Bexhill. In the 1950's it started  
 and boomed as a resort. This was      
 before the advent of jet airliners.   
 People wanted quiet holidays with     
{deckchairs, candyfloss and rock.}     </content>
