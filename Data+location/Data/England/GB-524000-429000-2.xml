		<content>           MANOR FARM                  
     Manor Farm is owned by Mr. T.     
 Harrison and run by Mr. Lewis, the    
 farm manager. The area of the farm,   
 including the fields, is 1600 acres.  
     In addition to the crops grown,   
 the farm has a large number of pig    
 units.                                
     The crops in the fields at the    
 moment are rape, barley, wheat and    
 beans. Once harvested, they are all   
 stored in separate sheds. The farm    
 stores rape seed for other farms      
 around the village as well as its own.
     Crops have to be cleaned and dried
 before they can be stored and the     
 farm has two machines for this        
 purpose. The Cimbria can dry 30 tons  
 of seed per hour, whilst the Turner   
 can only dry 18 tons per hour. Wheat  
 is dried at 180 degrees Fahrenheit and
 rape seed at 75 degrees Fahrenheit.   </content>
