		<title>01LIVING: A NEW HOUSING ESTATE</title>
		<content>My name is Mark Carey. I live in a     
modern housing estate just outside the 
vilage of Moulton and on the edge of   
Northampton. There are about 350 houses
on our estate. There are 12 houses in  
our street and our house is number 10. 
It is detached and it has got 4        
bedrooms, 1 bathroom, and 1 toilet     
upstairs. Downstairs we have a lounge, 
a dining room, kitchen, hall and porch.
We also have got a garage and carport  
outside. At the front and back of our  
house we have gardens and in the back  
garden we have a greenhouse. We also   
have got gas central heating. My mum   
and dad moved into this house on may   
17th 1974. The house was built in 1973 
and Dapple Light bricks were used.     
Redland Tiles were used to make the    
roof.
