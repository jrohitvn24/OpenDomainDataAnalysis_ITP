		<title>19BROWNIES IN KELVEDON</title>
		<content>    I am a {Brownie,}to become a       
 Brownie I had to be enrolled. We jump 
 over a  hedge when we are enrolled,   
 there are 3. Each one is made of 2    
 chairs with some flowers.At the end we
 look in the mirror on the floor and   
 pretend it is a pond and say "twist me
 and turn me and show me the  elf I    
 looked in the water and there saw-{   
 Myself." We say this as a promise to  
 help our leader,{Brown Owl.}          
    At Brownies we have a sing round   
 the toad stool then we have a pow-wow 
 it is a talk about the  events we     
 have. Then we have a game. My         
 favourite is "Glue Pot". Then we do   
 Journey Work. We have lots of things  
 to do. There are three levels, I am on
 "Roadway". Then we say a prayer, give 
 out badges and end with{Brownie Bells.
