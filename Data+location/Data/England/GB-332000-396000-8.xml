		<title>08Employment Survey</title>
		<content> We carried out a small employment     
 survey of the pupils leaving our      
 school.                               
 The results indicated that 36% of     
 families in our area were affected by 
 unemployment.Generally,there are less 
 people working.Many local factories   
 have closed down or are due to close  
 down and some of our friends have     
 moved away.                           
 Question:"What's it like being a child
 of an unemployed person ?"            
 Some of the answers : John said       
 "Sometimes it's quite good,I am always
 near my dad ". Helen replied "He is   
 always there when I come home from    
 school ". Finally, Maria said "In a   
 way I'm disappointed because I don't  
 get much pocket money and my dad feels
 a bit depressed because he hasn't got 
 much money either and he would like a 
 job ".                                </content>
