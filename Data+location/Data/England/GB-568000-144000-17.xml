		<title>17CHANGING EMPLOYMENT</title>
		<content>The main type of employment in Collier 
Street is farming.Fewer people work on 
farms now because not so many apples   
need picking and hops are picked by    
machine.About 25% of women in Collier  
Street work on farms.Until 1968 the    
owner of a farm would also own tied    
cottages,lived in by his employees.If  
these employees lost their jobs they   
would also lose their cottage. Collier 
Street is becoming a commuter village. 
The Journey to London takes about 1 and
a half hours.The business man usually  
leaves at 7 am. and arrives home at    
7pm.Commuters live in Collier Street   
because it is a peaceful,uncrowded and 
interesting community.Some of the      
occupations of the commuters are ...   
environmental health officers,plumbers,
fashion designers,wholesale fish       
merchant,and agricultural lecturers.
