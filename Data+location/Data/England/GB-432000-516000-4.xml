		<title>04SADBERGE SHEPHERD'S FARM</title>
		<content> The farmer's name is Christopher      
 Shepherd but I just call him Chris,his
 wife is called Sally and they haven't 
 any children .Their farm house is     
 quite old it was built about 1865.The 
 bricks for the house were all made by 
 hand.The farm is 225 acres.He has 70  
 calves.They have two sheep dogs       
 called Tweed and Bill their job is to 
 guard the farm.Alan Armstrong also    
 works on the farm,he drives the       
 tractor and looks after the cattle.One
 of the fields cannot be ploughed      
 because it contains remains of a Roman
 fort.I hope that someday, someone     
 comes along and excavates the field   
 and finds some interesting Roman      
 remains. From our classroom window  we
 can see the field with all its funny  
 shaped lumps and bumps.
