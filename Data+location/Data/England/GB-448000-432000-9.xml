		<content>{Education in Sherburn.}In the         
 17th.century a boys' school was built 
 in Sherburn.Later another school was  
 opened in Kirkgate for the girls and  
 infants.Hungate Junior School opened  
 in 1970 and in 1979 it became a       
 primary school when the former infant 
 school closed.The present school has  
 six classes and is built to an open   
 plan design.The facilities include    
 large playing fields and a heated     
 outdoor pool.                         
 Athelstan's school day starts at 9.15 
 and finishes at 3,30. The age of the  
 children varies from 4 to 11 years.   
 There are nine full time teachers and 
 one head teacher. 279 children attend 
 the school in 9 classrooms. The school
 is quite new, built in 1979. Our      
 school makes many visits to           
 interesting places, much of the work  
 is based on these visits.             </content>
