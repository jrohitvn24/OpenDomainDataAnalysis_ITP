		<title>11North Yorkshire village life</title>
		<content> A telephone &amp; car are almost essential
 &amp; shopping must be well planned.      
 Whilst supporting the village shop as 
 well as growing their own produce many
 housewives make a weekly trip to the  
 local market towns for the bulk of    
 their shopping. Although most houses  
 have modern equipment,central heating,
 washing machines,freezers &amp; perhaps   
 microwave ovens,one or two residents  
 still use the old side oven &amp; racken  
 with pots hanging over the fire.      
 Electricity is very important as none 
 of the villages has a town gas supply.
 However,wood is plentiful,cheap &amp; as  
 this is not a smokeless zone the open 
 fire,often with a back boiler to heat 
 water,is still extensively used.
