		<content> On Tuesday we went up the inmarsat    
building which is the tallest building 
in our area. We looked North so we     
could see our school street but not our
school because it was covered by       
houses. We saw Euston Station right    
below us because we were joined to     
Euston Tower. When we looked North we  
could see lots of secondary land use   
{park or grass}, in square seven we    
could see Gasholders, Camley Street,   
ST.Pancras gd, ST.Pancras hsp. In      
square nine we could see regents pk,   
Mosque. In square ten we could see     
Eversholt st, Euston Station. We could 
not see anything in square's 1,2,3,4,6,
8,11 or 12.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
