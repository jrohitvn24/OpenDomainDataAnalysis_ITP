a Midsummer Market in the village of   
Betley.The Market was to celebrate     
the 700th.anniversary of the start of  
the Church in Betley.Most of the       
organisations in the village were      
involved. Betley was granted a market  
charter in 1227 by King John.Because   
of this a market is the usual way of   
celebrating special events.There       
were  stalls of all different kinds    
of things.There was a stall with only  
orange and lemon colour things.There   
were flowers,books and ice cream       
stalls. Refreshments were sold in the  
school. There was a barbeque with hot  
dogs,hamburgers etc.The school did     
maypole dancing in the afternoon and   
there was a band on the village green. 
A fire engine came and some people     
played on it.In the school playground  
there were games and other things.     </content>
