		<content> A survey of many of these companies   
was made to try to discover why        
Daventry was chosen as a worksite.     
 The majority of those who replied to  
the survey concidered the town's       
geographical situation, and close      
proximity to the M1, M6 and other main 
routes  (road, rail &amp; air) as one of   
its main attractions. Other important  
factors were the availability of good  
factory units, a skilled workforce and 
housing for them.                      
 In 1985 work began on the new Drayton 
Fields Industrial Estate, and a further
one is planned at Welton Park. Many    
companies have already expressed       
interest in setting up business there.
