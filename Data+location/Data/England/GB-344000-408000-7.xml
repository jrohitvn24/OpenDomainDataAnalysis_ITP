Scientists at the Lathom laboratories  
are now working on many types of       
modern glass. {Safety glass}for cars   
is made from float glass.{Float glass} 
gets its name because it floats along  
on some type of liquid. It is made     
strong by heating it up and then       
cooling it down very fast with a blast 
of cool air. {Photochromic spectacle   
lenses}are very special because they go
dark in bright light and in dark light 
they go lighter. {Fibre optic glasses} 
are long thin threads of glass used    
instead of metal wires in telephone and
television cables.                     
Pilkingtons gave us a new {circular    
window}for our school. It was installed
to celebrate our Centenary in 1981. It 
is made of mirror glass and has the    
coat of arms of the 1st Earl of Lathom 
on it.                                 </content>
