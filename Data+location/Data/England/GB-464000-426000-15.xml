		<content> An Interview with Mrs Rockliffe.      
                                       
 Mrs Rockliffe has lived in her present
 house in Camblesforth for 28 years.   
 Before that she lived at Escrick.     
 The only livestock she keeps are      
 bullocks. She owns 135 acres of land. 
 "The harvest season is the hardest    
 work...The crops we grow are, sugar   
 beet, Winter wheat, Winter barley and 
 Spring barley."                       
 Mrs Rockliffe is also a Parish        
 Councillor."The playing field and the 
 village hall have provided facilities 
 for entertainment throughout the      
 village." She told us she thought the 
 village needed more green areas and   
 needed to be kept pretty. As a Parish 
 Councillor she sorts out the problems 
 of the village. She attends the       
 monthly W.I. meetings and enjoys      
 painting and emroidery.               </content>
