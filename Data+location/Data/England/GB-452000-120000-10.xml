		<title>10UPHAM YOUTH CLUB</title>
		<content>    Upham Youth Club is for 9-13 year  
 olds. The youngsters play things such 
 as swingball, which is a ball on the  
 end of a stick. On top of that is     
 twisted a coil of metal. The ball is  
 fixed to the end of a piece of rope,  
 the other end of which is fastened by 
 a metal ring to the metal coil.       
 When the ball is hit with a bat it    
 goes round and round, making the ring 
 go up or down the metal coil,         
 depending on which way the ball is    
 hit. Two people play, one up and one  
 down; the winner is the one who makes 
 the ring reach his "goal" first.      
    Other games are played as well, and
 there is a tuck shop in which people  
 can buy sweets and soft drinks.       
    There are four Leaders.Sometimes   
 members go on outings, have barbecues 
 and go swimming.
