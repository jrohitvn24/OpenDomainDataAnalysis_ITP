		<title>17Demo about the Green Belt</title>
		<content>  Parents from the Sidcup Area held a  
{demonstration}outside Wednesdays      
 Bexley Council Meeting. The protest   
 was about proposals that some believe 
 could destroy local Green Belt.       
  Councillor John Harrington presented 
 a{lengthy petition}of several hundred 
 signatures to the council.            
  The plans included selling off       
 playing field lands from five primary 
 schools,including Dulverton and Sidcup
 Hill,also Green Belt land in North    
 Cray.                                 
  Parents have also{engaged a solicitor
{to fight the proposals,}which would   
 mean that the land would be sold for  
 housing,raising several million pounds
 for council funds, but this would not 
 necessarily be used for education.    
{ There are fears in the area that this
{could start wholesale development of  
{remaining Green Belt land.            </content>
