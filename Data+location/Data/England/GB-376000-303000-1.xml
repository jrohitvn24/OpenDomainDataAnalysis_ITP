		<title>01SUMMARY OF  AREA</title>
		<content> The area covered is to the west of the
 village of Albrighton.It has no       
 concentrated centre of population     
 apart from the quarters,workshops and 
 offics of R.A.F.Cosford.What people   
 there are live mainly on the farms and
 in farm cottages apart from the houses
 which are scattered along the A464.   
     The area is incredibly flat with a
 range of low hills running NE-SW      
 across the SW corner.This produces    
 good agricultural land which is used  
 both for cattle-rearing and crop      
 growing.                              
   The River Worfe runs diagonally N-SW
 across the area providing a variety in
 the landscape.There are areas of wood-
 land along the Worfe and are found in 
 the main within the grounds of Hatton 
 Grange.                               
   The A464 and main railway line run  
 parallel diagonally across the area   </content>
