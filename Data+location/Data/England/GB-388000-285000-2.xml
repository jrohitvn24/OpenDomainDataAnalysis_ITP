		<content>    The most significant happening in  
 our area over the last few months has 
 been the opening of{Dudley's}newest   
 school.{St.James's Primary}is a new   
 church school formed by amalgamating  
 the old{Wollaston C.E.Junior School,} 
 which was 125 years old, and{Meadow   
{Park Infants School,}a mere 25 years  
 old. The new school is based on the   
 site of the old Meadow Park school    
 using existing buildings plus a new   
 and stylish junior and library        
 block, an extension that is in keeping
 with its strong church connections.   
 Many of the village community groups  
 who previously used the old{Wollaston 
 facilities have followed the school to
 its new site. The move has also       
 shortened travelling time for most of 
 the children attending the school.
