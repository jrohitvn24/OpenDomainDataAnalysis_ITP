		<title>20DOMESDAY PROJECT IN MIDHURST</title>
		<content> The information contained in these    
 pages was researched by the 13 year   
 old,third year pupils  at Midhurst    
 Intermediate School as part of their  
 History course.                       
     We owe a large debt of thanks to  
 the many people in our area who gave  
 up their time to be interviewed or    
 fill in our questionnaires,and who    
 gave us copies of some very useful and
 interesting documents.All of this     
 detailed information will appear in   
 the book on the area which we are     
 compiling in school and copies will be
 distributed to all those who helped us
 and to the Public Library.            
     It is regrettable that we were not
 able to gather enough reliable        
 information about the Cowdray family  
 and estate which are important        
 features of the area.
