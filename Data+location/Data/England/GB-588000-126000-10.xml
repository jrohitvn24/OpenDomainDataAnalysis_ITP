		<title>10Dennis's Day Part 1</title>
		<content>  I get up at 6.30.  I get my clothes  
 on and go downstairs, then I have my  
 breakfast; I have 2 bowls of          
 cornflakes, bacon and some toast.     
 Then when I have finished I go back   
 upstairs and wash my face and hands. I
 go back downstairs and brush my teeth 
 while my Mum has a cup of coffee,     
 drinking chocolate or cocoa.  Then we 
 go out to the bus which usually comes 
 at 8.20.  When we get to school we    
 have a little playtime until 9 o'clock
 when school starts.                   
  When we go in we sit and read while  
 Mrs. Watts does the register.  At 9.10
 it is Assembly, where we have hymns,  
 prayers and a story which Mrs.        
 Harrington reads. Then we go back into
 class and work until 10.30 when it is 
 playtime. When we go out we race      
 because the first one gets gold, the  
 next silver, then bronze.             </content>
