		<content>    Up until this year, there have been
 only{3}schools in Towcester:          
 Towcester Infants, Towcester Junior   
 and Sponne secondary school. This year
 there are plans to open a new primary 
 school in order to cope with the      
 increased number of children who live 
 in the area.                          
                                       
{TOWCESTER INFANT SCHOOL               
    They take 4-7 year olds and they   
 have 9 teaching staff at present.     
{TOWCESTER JUNIOR SCHOOL               
    This is right next to the infant   
 school and takes the children at      
 present from 7-11. There are about 360
 pupils in the school, although this   
 will change when the new school is    
 built.                                
{SPONNE SECONDARY SCHOOL} Children aged
 11-18 attend this school, built around
 the old grammar school.               </content>
