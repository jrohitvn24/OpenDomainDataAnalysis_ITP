		<title>18LIFE STYLES IN THE AREA</title>
		<content>  Most people moved to the area because
they liked the situation of their house
and the countryside. A smaller group   
were born here. Most people are skilled
workers,or, in a profession or         
management. Most people enjoy their    
work. Many had had previous similar    
jobs. Only a few are self-employed.    
Few people work alone. Many people     
work locally,or in Ipswich but more    
work in London than in Colchester.     
As public transport is poor, many      
families own at least one car. Some    
people own boats. Only Chelmondiston   
has any shops, so many people have     
to buy food in other villages or       
nearby towns. Most people did feel     
that their local shops were adequate,  
but many said they preferred to use    
large super-markets. Most people would 
also like to have a Chemist's shop and 
a D.I.Y. store nearby.                 </content>
