  Children learning to write started on
 slates and then moved on to paper.    
  Nowadays the main subjects are read- 
 ing,language and maths but the whole  
 of the curriculum is important.       
 History, Geography and Science are    
 often taught as inter-related         
 subjects. The children use the        
 immediate environment as a starting   
 point.Music, Drama, Movement, Physical
 Education and Games are all included  
 on the timetable.Religion does not    
 play as important a part, but it sets 
 the moral standard.                   
    Today there are 104 children, 4    
 teachers and the Headmistress. There  
 are 4 classes. The Headmistress is not
 class-based. A cook and assistant are 
 employed, hot meals are served each   
 day. Also there is a secretary and a  
 caretaker who work for the school.    </content>
