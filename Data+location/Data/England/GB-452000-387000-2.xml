		<content> We interviewed Mrs. Hoggard, who has  
 always lived in our area. She is      
 nearly ready to retire from her job at
 our school, so we wanted to know about
 her hopes and fears. The first things 
 Mrs. Hoggard said she was worried     
 about were vandalism and              
 unemployment. She thought it would    
 help if a policeman walked the streets
 like in the olden days. This would    
 help stop vandalism. Even so, the     
 village is still quiet, but busier    
 than when she was younger.            
 Unemployment worried her a lot, but   
 she didn't know what could be done.   
 Mrs. Hoggard has never lived anywhere 
 else but in this area. She said that  
 she wouldn't like to live in a        
 built-up area. She has lived in a     
 stone cottage but prefers her brick   
 built house she now lives in.
