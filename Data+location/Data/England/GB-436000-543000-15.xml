		<title>15*OUT AND ABOUT IN HASWELL*</title>
		<content> Haswell has quite a big church called 
 St. Paul's.Services start at 9.30a.m  
 and are taken by Rev. Bill Rumball. I 
 think he is a children's vicar because
 he makes nearly everything like old   
 shoes and garden spades resemble      
 Christ. There is a Sunday school every
 week unless there is a Family Service.
 There is also a chapel in Haswell. It 
 is not very big.It has been painted   
 white and was built in 1849. It has   
 few services as not many people go to 
 chapel now.It has a total congregation
 of about 10 people.                   
 There is an old pit but it is in ruins
 now.Today the pit is very picturesque 
 and the heaps are grassed over.       
 The Community Centre is one of the    
 newest buildings.There are discos and 
 film shows.The doctor's surgery is    
 also held there.
