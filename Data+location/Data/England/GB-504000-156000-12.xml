		<content> The only doctor's practice here is    
 in Ripley: there are Group practices  
 nearby in West Byfleet and East       
 Horsley. The Orthopaedic hospital in  
 Pyrford is the subject of a Special   
 Feature. A District nurse provides    
 some care in the home, particularly   
 for convalescents and there is a      
 special Health visitor for the        
 elderly, who also regularly visits    
 mothers with young children. There is 
 a mobile physiotherapy van. A         
 neighbouring Day hospital sends an    
 ambulance to collect old people which 
 helps their families.                 
 The sewage system was replaced in 1939
 by a new Works serving the area and   
 beyond; treated effluent enters the   
 Wey Navigation, controlled by the     
 Thames Water Authority.
