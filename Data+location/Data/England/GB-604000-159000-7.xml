		<title>07STREET BUILDING SURVEY</title>
		<content>   The following list was drawn from   
 our survey on the function and age of 
 buildings along The Street of Boughton
 village.                              
 There are{66}pre-Victorian houses.    
          {31}Victorian houses.        
          {11}post-Victorian houses.   
          {16}modern houses.           
 There are{ 5}general stores.          
           {5}antique shops.           
           {3}hairdressers.            
           {3}public houses.           
           {2}churches.                
           {8}other stores.            
  Here are some conclusions.We think   
 that the village started at the west  
 end of The Street,because all the     
 timber framed buildings were at that  
 end.These are the earliest by far.Most
 of the modern houses were at the east 
 end.Victorian houses were mainly      
 ditributed throughout the middle part.</content>
