		<content> The Purple Emperor butterfly lives on 
 Whieparish common It has got spotted  
 wings of white.It is one of the       
 largest British butterflies, and it is
 a rare type.Sometimes the wing span   
 can be from 3 ins.Butterflies get     
 their refreshments from flowers or    
 ripe fruits but the Emperor butterfly 
 does not do this.It goes into the     
 woods and drinks from a muddy pool.You
 would think this is very dirty but    
 they also settle on dead rabbits.The  
 female Purple Emperor lays her eggs on
 one leaf at a time.The caterpillar,   
 after feeding until early October,    
 goes into hibernation.It often chooses
 a place on a sallow twig and remains  
 there throughout the winter without   
 any protection, but it also hibernates
 in a dead leaf,and when this happens  
 the caterpillar fastens the stem of   
 the leaf to the twig by a thread.     </content>
