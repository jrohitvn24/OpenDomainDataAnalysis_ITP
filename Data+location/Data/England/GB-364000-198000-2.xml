		<title>02LAND USE IN BERKELEY VALE</title>
		<content> This area is in the middle of the     
 Severn's flood plain, which stretches 
 from the Forest of Dean to the        
 Cotswolds. The land is clay because of
 flooding in the past and is chiefly   
 used for{grazing;}mainly{dairy cattle 
 and a few{horses.}In the fields to the
 south and west of Ham permanent jumps 
 have been set up for horse trials.    
 Other fields are uesd to make{silage  
 and{hay}for winter fodder for animals.
{Fruit trees}which once were sheltered 
 in the orchards by elms are now       
 exposed due to{dutch elm disease      
 having killed many of the elms. The   
 exposed fruit trees are now also dying
 off leaving fields uneven and only fit
 for livestock. Unfortunately due to   
 lack of possible returns new fruit    
 trees are not being planted, so it    
 would seem that this area of land will
 eventaully become even more exposed.  </content>
