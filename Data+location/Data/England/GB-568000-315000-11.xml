		<content> An Interview with Mrs. Chapman, the   
 headteacher.                          
 Mrs Chapman lives in Shouldham, a     
 village about eight miles away from   
 East Winch. She is married to a       
 farmer. The two other teachers live in
 Fair Green and North Runcton which are
 both a few miles away from the        
 school. They all travel to school by  
 car. Most of the other people who work
 in the school live in the village.    
 The main changes to take place in the 
 school have been the incresing use of 
 educational television and the        
 introduction of computers. The        
 children now work far more at their   
 own pace rather than working together 
 as a class.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
