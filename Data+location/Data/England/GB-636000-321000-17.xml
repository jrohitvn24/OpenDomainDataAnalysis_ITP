		<title>17CLUBS IN SUTTON</title>
		<content> In common with many rural communities,
 Sutton has a number of clubs and      
 societies to cater for the interests  
 of the villagers. The elderly people  
 are catered for by a club called "The 
 Good Companions". The village hall is 
 home of the Sutton Playgroup and      
 Mothers' Union. Keep fit and bingo    
 sessions also take place in the hall. 
 The Women's Institute is also         
 active in the village and the A.T.C.  
 meet in the old school next to the    
 church. A playing field site is still 
 being prepared.
