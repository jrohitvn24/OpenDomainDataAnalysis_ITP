		<title>06DANGER ON RIVER AVON</title>
		<content>  4th July 1985                        
 It has been the wettest June for 35   
 years so the River Avon was at a very 
 high level and was flowing fast.  A   
 fourteen year old boy was drowned by  
 the weir at Evesham.  He was one of   
 three boys in a two man canoe.  None  
 of the boys had a lifejacket on at the
 time.  The current swept them         
 downstream and the canoe overturned.  
 One of the boys tried to save his     
 friend, but the boy was washed away.  
 Police searched the river but there   
 was no trace of the boy.  It was not  
 until ten days later that his body was
 found near the ferry at Hampton.  Now 
 police are advising everyone to wear a
 lifejacket and never go out on the    
 river alone.  Everyone who liked      
 fishing, swimming, diving, boating and
 canoeing should join a club and have  
 some training.                        </content>
