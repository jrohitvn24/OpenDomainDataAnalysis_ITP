		<title>10The Church, Yelden</title>
		<content> Yelden Parish Church of St. Mary the  
 Virgin is an example of the decorated 
 style but little of it's 12th Century 
 origins remain and it is now          
 predominantly 14th Century. Like many 
 of the churches throughout the country
 St. Mary's is in need of restoration. 
 A minimum of Â£40,000 is required to   
 prevent the Breach Tower from         
 collapsing. A grant of 75% is being   
 offered by the government for repairs 
 and the additional money is being     
 raised by the villagers holding       
 events. One such event was a Barn     
 Dance held at Rifle Range Farm in July
 which raised Â£370.                    
 Being 1 of the 6 Stodden Churches the 
 vicar rotates the services on a6      
 weekly basis. Children are welcomed to
 the Family Communion.                 
 Ladies in the village take care of the
 cleaning and flower arrangements.     </content>
