It was at this time that the cottage   
based work ceased, all the processes   
being centralized.Throughout the       
nineteenth century, additions to the   
building were made not only westwards  
along the High Street but also         
northwards behind the main building,   
until by 1885 the building was         
complete. The Company kept modernising 
internally although some old looms     
still existed in the 1950's. New Tean  
Mill Ltd as it is now known is the     
largest employer in the area with a    
work force of about 350.It produces    
many different items ranging from      
ribbons to electrical insulating       
material mostly made from man-made     
fibre.
