		<title>17Hogsthorpe Village.</title>
		<content> In years past Hogsthorpe was known as 
 a town and it was a thriving marsh    
 community.It used to have a small     
 toffee factory and many shops in the  
 high street.Sheep grazed all round.It 
 was bigger than Skegness untill the   
 railway came.Today there are no       
 sheep,only a few cows and the land    
 thanks to the drainage improvements is
 used for barley,wheat,potatoes and    
 rape seed.Mr Mcdonald is an excallent 
 potter and runs a busines making his  
 own attractive and unique pottery at  
 Mill stone crafts.There is a small    
 bakers still making and selling bread 
 and buns but he only sells very localy
 now.Hogsthorpe has two pubs,the       
 Saracens  head,a free house and the   
 Victoria Tarven whitch sells the local
 real ale beers.The Saracens have an   
 excellent Tug o'War team,a popular    
 sport in rural Lincolnshire.          </content>
