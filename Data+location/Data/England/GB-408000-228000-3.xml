		<content> The roads around our 'D' block are    
 not very wide so that when lorries go 
 by there is very little room for      
 anything else and you have to stop and
 go one at a time. Often there deep    
 potholes that should be filled in.    
 There are a lot of lorries because we 
 have several quarries in the area and 
 also lorries fetch the grain from the 
 farms after it has been harvested. In{
{winter}the {roads}are very{bad}as they
 easily become{blocked with snowdrifts 
 up to{14 feet high.}The only{main road
 is the{B4077}from {Tewkesbury}to{Stow 
{on the Wold.}The nearest {motorway}   
 isthe {M5}at Tewkesbury and the       
 nearest{Railway Station}is at {Moreton
{in Marsh.}We have a bus to{Cheltenham 
 and back daily and one to {Moreton    
{market}every{ Tuesday.}
