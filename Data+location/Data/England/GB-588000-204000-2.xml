		<title>02MUNDON AND THE BLACKWATER.</title>
		<content>            -THE CLIMATE-              
 In Summer one of the warmest parts of 
 England is Essex. In Winter it is much
 colder than Ireland and the West.The  
 region is drier than the North and the
 West having less than 750mm's of rain.
   Mundon is low-lying land bordering  
 the Blackwater Estuary. The Estuary   
 stays mostly at the same temperature  
 so Mundon is inclined to be dry. Often
 when nearby areas are suffering from  
 storms and floods the Mundon area is  
 hardly affected. In June this year    
 crops in some parts of Essex were     
 ruined by hailstones the size of golf 
 balls. At the same time Maldon and    
 Heybridge suffered bad flooding but   
 the two farms in Mundon had only      
 moderate rainfall.                    
   The highest rainfall is in January  
 closely followed by September.
