		<title>11LAW AND ORDER/ROAD SAFETY</title>
		<content>  Sherborne Police Station always seems
 busy but there is no major crime in   
 this area. Crime prevention and drug  
 education is considered important.    
 Finding missing children seems fairly 
 common, but road traffic is the main  
 problem. At least 3 policemen are on  
 patrol all the time and do 8hr shifts.
  Sherborne is one of the safest places
 to drive_ because of lack of accidents
 the council find no need for a bypass.
 People are concerned as the night emer
 _gency ambulance cover is reduced.    
  Tourists often go the wrong way up   
 one_way streets. The magistrates court
 regularly fines drivers up to Â£200    
 for speeding, careless, and drunken   
 driving. If people obeyed the rules   
 no accidents would occur. Even though 
 this rule is well known no one ever   
 learns. It is mainly boys under the   
 age of 20 who get fined for speeding. </content>
