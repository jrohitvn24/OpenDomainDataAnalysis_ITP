 area. There is St. Matthews,{( Church 
{of England ),}a{Mormon}church called  
 'The Church of Jesus Christ of the

{Catholic}Church.

           According to interview      
 sources a lot of people still think   
 there is something of a village       
 atmosphere, in our area, especially in
 those places near to{Scartho.}It is   
 felt, however, that a lot could be    
 done to bring the community much      
 closer together. An example of this   
 sort of{community action}takes place  
 at{Christmas}when old people are      
 invited into{Fairfield Middle School.
