		<title>18 Role of a Hospital Doctor</title>
		<content> Dr.Denis Edwards, the Consultant at   
 the Intensive Care Unit at Withington 
 Hospital came to talk to our class    
 about his job.                        
 One boy asked why Dr.Edwards didn't   
 treat private patients or work in a   
 private clinic. He replied that he    
 didn't believe that private medicine  
 was right and so he only treated NHS  
 patients.                             
 We were told that life support        
 machines served up to eight patients  
 in the Intensive Care Unit, but it    
 seems that at least half of the       
 patients admitted died of their       
 injuries.  It appeared to be rather   
 depressing being a doctor in intensive
 care especially when Dr.Edwards       
 described some of the worst cases.    
 Dr.Edwards said he got very           
 frustrated about lack of money for    
 much needed equipment and extra nurses</content>
