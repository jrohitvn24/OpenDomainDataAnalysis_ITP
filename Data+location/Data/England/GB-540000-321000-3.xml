   "There have been many new people    
 coming to this area in the last 15    
 years, mainly retired people. This has
 probably been the result of homes     
 being cheaper here than in the        
 south-east of England. Retired people 
 come here from selling their dearer   
 houses and topping up their pensions  
 with the resulting surplus. You can   
 probably restrict progress but I don't
 think you can stop it. It is probably 
 a pity to see good arable land being  
 used and yet on the other hand the    
 district needs newcomers and likes    
 to have them. I think what should be  
 done wherever possible is that old    
 sites should be re-used before they   
 break into new land."
