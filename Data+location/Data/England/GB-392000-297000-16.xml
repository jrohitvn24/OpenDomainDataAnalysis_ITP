		<content> Although many people live in          
Wolverhampton there are very few public
amenties,espcially those designed for  
children.There are a few parks,one     
swimming bath and a few Youth Centres  
but no cinemas or skating rinks.There  
are,however,many clubs and public      
houses and a Greyhound Stadium at      
Monmore Green, which also contains     
Speedway track,for adults.There are no 
banks or building society offices even 
though there are still many industries 
and shops.                             
There are many parts of this area which
consist of derelict land which could be
used to site many of the missing       
amenities which are important for the  
social life of the inhabitants of this 
area                                   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
