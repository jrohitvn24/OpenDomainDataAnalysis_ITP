		<title>18Heaton suburb of Newcastle</title>
		<content>    East of the Ouseburn valley  lies  
 Heaton, Victorian housing grading in  
 size from the edge of Armstrong Park  
 on Heaton Road, East to the small     
 terraces by the railway yard: a       
 classic{Hoyt}urban transect also      
 repeated elsewhere in Newcastle.      
    On Heaton Road is a small colonial 
 concentration, mainly professional    
 occupations.  Further east many of the
 houses are the traditional and        
 widespread{Tyneside Flats;}two front  
 doors, one flat on each floor, the top
 flat having outside steps to a yard   
 and a back lane.  Many are now owner  
 occupied and an extensive{renovation} 
 scheme operates.  The older Byker (S) 
 end underwent earlier clearance with  
 medium rise{rebuilding,}and more      
 tenant occupation.                    
    The transect no longer reflects the
 character of the population.          </content>
