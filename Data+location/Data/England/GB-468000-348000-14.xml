		<title>14ADVANTAGES OF RURAL LIVING</title>
		<content>   The most common response to a small-
 sample,school-initiated questionnaire 
 concerned the{environment}of{Bleasby  
{and Thurgarton}:pleasant,peaceful,    
 attractive,lovely countryside,open-   
 spaced,away from the town and,particu-
 larily,healthy. Children's health and 
 safety were raised too.{Village       
{ atmosphere}was noted "in which one   
 could "turn-off" in the evenings and  
 at weekends."Comments were also made  
 about the Community spirit;"nice"     
 people,active co-operation,socialising
 ,and everyone{knowing each other}and  
 being friendly. Some liked the local  
{ schools},both Primary and Secondary. 
   Listed also in various forms was    
 that it wasn't too far to town and    
 that the villages were central between
 the A1 and M1.Then there was scope for
 walking and being on one's own.Sadly, 
 for one person, there's{no advantage. </content>
