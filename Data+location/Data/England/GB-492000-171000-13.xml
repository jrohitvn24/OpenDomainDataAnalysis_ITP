		<title>13LEISURE IN THE GREAT PARK</title>
		<content>    The Park is a wonderful place for  
 many kinds of activities.  Members of 
 the general public are freely allowed 
 to enjoy walking (with or without a   
 dog), cycling, picnicking and studying
 nature.  Access is restricted in      
 some areas to those who have a key    
 (Â£8) and permits are required for     
 riding (Â£40), fishing and shooting.   
    Sponsored walks, rides and runs    
 take place here and much money is     
 raised for charity.                   
    The Marathon course of the Carriage
 Driving Championships runs through    
 this area.  Spectators appreciate the 
 strength of the horses and the skill  
 of the drivers.                       
    The Queen graciously allows her    
 people to relax in these beautiful    
 surroundings.
