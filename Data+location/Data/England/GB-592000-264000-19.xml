		<title>19HOUSING IN THURSTON</title>
		<content>                                       
 Thurston is in reality two villages   
which have merged into one .The oldest 
part is near the church.Some of the    
houses are farm cottages,while some    
were built to house workers on the     
railway in the 19th Century.           
 There is a large amount of private    
housing in Thurston,with most of the   
houses  being for first-time buyers    
and families.Most of these houses      
have been built since 1945,and are a   
mixture of bungalows and normal houses.
  There are some council houses and    
some old peoples bungalows.            
  Many of those living in Thurston     
travel to work in Ipswich,Bury St.     
Edmunds,Newmarket,Stowmarket and       
Cambridge.
