		<title>01Morwenstow Gazetteer</title>
		<content> This block covers most of the northern
 half of{Morwenstow,}the most northerly
 parish  in  Cornwall.  The  land  lies
 mainly some  400 to 600 feet above sea
 level, though there are beaches in the
 north west,  notably at{Yeolmouth.}The
 main centre of population  is at{Shop,
 where most of the parish amenities are
 situated.  There are other  small com-
 munities at{Crosstown}and{Gooseham}and
 a number of scattered farm houses. The
 main  occupation is  farming, although
 several  residents  commute from{Shop,
 etc., to jobs in{Bude}and other neigh-
 bouring areas.                        
 Here it is often  windswept and  bleak
 in winter, but in summer many tourists
 are attracted.  Some visit the church,
 drawn particularly  by its association
 with {R.S.Hawker; }others pass through
 as  they  travel  the {North  Cornwall
{Coastal Footpath.                     </content>
