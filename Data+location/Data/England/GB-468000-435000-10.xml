		<title>10Gardening in N.Duffield</title>
		<content> In North Duffield there is lots of    
 gardening.People grow vegetables such 
 as peas, beans,cauliflowers,potatoes, 
 carrots,lettuces and turnips.These and
 fruit trees are used to supplement the
 diet in the home.There is market      
 gardening where these crops are also  
 grown only on a larger scale and when 
 ready are sold.Small holdings are     
 quite popular.These are fairly large  
 plots of land where livestock are     
 grazed on crops grown.Most of the     
 surrounding land is heavily farmed    
 with chemicals which kills off many   
 insects.Some scientists are worried   
 about the affects the chemicals will  
 have on the food chains if they are   
 over used.The land on which North     
 Duffield is is very marshy with lots  
 of dykes around.the insect, animal and
 plantlife can easily be affected if   
 too many chemicals are used.          </content>
