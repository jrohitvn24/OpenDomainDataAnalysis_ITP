		<title>14   Fire Service (cont.)</title>
		<content>   The Firemen have to live very       
 locally,within two miles of the       
 station,so that they can get to the   
 engine quickly in an emergency.They   
 have local jobs such as milkman,      
 mechanic, shop assistant etc.The      
 station has had some very unusual     
 calls such as a cow in a cess pit and 
 a horse in a swimming pool!           
  On July 12th.1985,the local firemen  
 were joined by men from the large     
 stations in nearby towns to fight a   
 fire which broke out in historic      
 Missenden Abbey. The building, which  
 is owned by Bucks. County Council, has
 been used for courses of various      
 kinds.A large new development has     
 almost been completed and the old     
 building was about to be modernised   
 when disaster struck.The interior has 
 been gutted and the damage has been   
 estimated to be a million pounds.     </content>
