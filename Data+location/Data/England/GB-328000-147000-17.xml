 Highbbidge Docks were built in 1854 in
 connection with the SOMERSET &amp; DORSET 
 RAILWAY,to provide a port on the      
 BRISTOL CHANNEL for import &amp;          
 exports.The main river Clyce was      
 diverted through the New Cut(see      
 P.15)and the old course was developed 
 into the dock.Timber,coal,livestock &amp; 
 general cargo were the major goods.The
 S &amp; D Rly. owned 3 boats whose main   
 function was to ply between the docks 
 &amp; S.Wales carring coal for the        
 Railway,as its main repair &amp;          
 maintainence depot was at             
 Highbridge.The end came when the      
 railway closed its works in the       
 1930's.Even then the docks staggered  
 on until the 1960's when it was       
 abandoned.(see P.18)
