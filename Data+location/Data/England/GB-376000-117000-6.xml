		<content>  At school we first went into service 
 and after the last hymm we listened   
 to a girl play her flute.In class we  
 did maths for a long time and then it 
 was playtime.After play we had sewing.
 I was making patchwork.After about    
 half an hour I went back and finished 
 my tissue paper pictue.We played      
 before lunch and when the whistle     
 blew went into dinner.I ate my        
 sandwiches.                           
  After lunch I changed into my        
 plimsolls for country dancing.At      
 2.30 p.m.we went out to play during   
 which we had to get ready for         
 athletics.When I got home I changed   
 into  my leotard and tracksuit to go  
 to gym at the school. When I got home 
 again I had a pizza to eat, put on my 
 pyjamas and switched on my electric   
 blanket.At nine o'clock I went to bed 
 with a drink of lemon squash.         </content>
