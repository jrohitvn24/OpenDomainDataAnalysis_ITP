		<title>08FARMING BURTON LAZARS</title>
		<content> There are three main farms in Burton  
 with stone houses and modern buildings
 around them.Two of them are small     
 family farms to the West of the       
 village and their fields are all      
 grassland.These are used for grazing  
 bullocks,sheep and lambs also cows and
 calves.Some grass is cut for haymaking
 in the summer,to be used for winter   
 feed for the animals.One farm keeps   
 pigs rearing piglets for pork and     
 keeps hens for eggs.The third farm is 
 a large arable farm called East farm  
 to the East of the village,tenanted to
 a business man who grows corn to use  
 in his breakfast cereal factory.He    
 grows wheat,barley,oats and oil seed  
 rape.The rape seed is used for        
 margarine.This farm uses large        
 machinery to do the work but only     
 employs a small number of men.
