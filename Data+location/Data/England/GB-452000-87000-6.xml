 letting. It is mainly a sheep farm but
 there are also horses and some        
 poultry.                              
    They have{4-500}lambs a year. About
 spring time there are{1000}sheep on   
 the farm. The sheep are shorn once a  
 year about spring time. They have     
 quite a problem with the foxes.       
    In the winter the owner{Mr Campbell
 feeds the animals on hay and liquid   
 food and in the summer they graze the 
 fields.                               
    They do sell some animals and go to

 severe winter of{1985}more because    
 quite a few animals were ill or died  
 because of the cold.{Little East      
{Standen farm}is disease-free.
