		<content> Westfields Assessment Centre is housed
 in a mill owners house, which was     
 built in 1868. It was extended as a   
 childrens home and then in 1976 it    
 became a residential centre for 36    
{disturbed children.}These children    
 spend 6 weeks or more at the Centre   
 during which time they are{assessed   
 for suitable long term treatment      
 either at their own home under the    
 supervision of a social worker or at  
{special schools.                      
 The teaching staff, social workers and
 care staff are all required to report 
 on each child at regular{case         
{conferences.}Good behaviour can earn a
 child privileges eg. unescorted visits
 to the swimming baths. Outdoor        
 activities such as{orienteering}and   
{camping}are encouraged. The children  
 live in family groups of 4-8 persons  
 which creates a friendly atmosphere.  </content>
