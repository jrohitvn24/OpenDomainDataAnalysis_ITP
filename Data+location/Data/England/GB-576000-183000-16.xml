		<title>16Benfleet - The housing</title>
		<content>  The housing in the area is mixed.    
 There are old cottages, some post war 
 bungalows and a few recent (1970's)   
 town houses.The most extensive        
 development (1950's-1960's) has spread
 from the centre towards the N.W. and  
 N.E. The lack of building space around
 old Benfleet has preserved the        
 character of the village. No further  
 housing development of The Downs is   
 allowed at the present time as the    
 area is designated an open space for  
 the pleasure and recreation of local  
 people. The Downs are managed by      
 Castle Point District Council, who    
 seeks to preserve its natural beauty  
 and wildlife habitats. The land from  
 Benfleet Station,2 Kilometres         
 eastwards, is mainly shrubs, grassland
 and old meadows, leading eventually to
 wood land.                            
                                       </content>
