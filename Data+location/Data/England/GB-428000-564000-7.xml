		<content> Mrs Stephenson has just become        
 employed at the Shell{Garage.}She told
 us that she likes working there       
 because she gets on well with the     
 other{employees}and knows many of the 
 customers.The garage sells more petrol
 than diesel fuel and sweets,ice_cream 
 and various car accessories.The things
 she does not like are motorists'      
 impatience when they have to queue and
 the prospect of being held up.If she  
 is,she has two panic buttons to press 
 which bring the police.She told us    
 that many people pay in cash,but many 
 also use Credit Cards of which 8      
 different types are accepted at the   
 garage.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
