		<title>11Family Life in Niton 1985</title>
		<content> John and I have lived in Niton for 15 
 years.We have four children Hannah    
 (11 years) Emily (7 years) Lynne      
 (5 years) and Daniel (1&amp;a half). The  
 children were born at St.Mary's       
 Hospital,Newport. At 5 years they     
 start school in the village.At 9 years
 they go by bus to  Ventnor Middle     
 School. Niton has many footpaths and  
 the countryside is very interesting.  
 We see domestic sheep,cows,horses     
 and donkeys,and wild foxes, rabbits,  
 badgers, and birds, and many wild     
 flowers. We like to go to the local   
  beach to swim and play. On Monday    
 nights Hannah goes to Youth Club.     
 Their activities include swimming,    
 canoeing, cycling and watching videos.
 On Fridays Emily goes to 'Brownies".  
 Niton is quiet in Winter,but busy with
 holidaymakers in the summer.We have   
 found Niton a safe and happy community</content>
