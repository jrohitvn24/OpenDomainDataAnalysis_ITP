		<content> Gardening and television viewing are  
 the mort popular recreational         
 activities.Films,sport,soap           
 operas,nature being the programmes    
 people most liked to watch.           
 Most of the residents in the area     
 attended functions in the village     
 hall.Only 2 people attended an evening
 class and 4 studied at home.          
 The Theatre,Cinema,Sport and Leisure  
 Centre were not often visited because 
 of the long travel involved and lack  
 of public transport.                  
 Visits to a swimming pool were an     
 exception,several people were prepared
 to travel to take their children to   
 the swimming baths.
