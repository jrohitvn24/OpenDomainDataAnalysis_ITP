 YOU CAN'T GO TO COURT UNTIL YOU ARE   
 10/ YOU CAN GO TO WATCH AFTER YOU ARE 
 14.THE MAGISTRATE IS JUST A NORMAL    
 PERSON TO JUDGE AN ARGUMENT. THERE IS 
 THE DEFENCE AND PROSECUTION. THE      
 MAGISTRATE CAN HAVE UP TO 6 PEOPLE    
 WITH HIM ON THE BENCH. THE CLERK SITS 
 IN FRONT OF THE MAGISTRATE AND KNOWS  
 ALL THE LAW. THE COURT IS IN THE      
 POLICE STATION AND WAS BUILT IN 1887. 
 THE MAGISTRSTES COURT IS ONLY A MINOR 
 COURT. THE MAJOR COURT IS THE CROWN   
 COURT .IT HAS A TRAINED JUDGE. WHEN   
 THE MAGISTRATES COURT IS BEING USED   
 THEY SAY IT IS IN SESSION. THE        
 MAGISTRATES COURT IS ONLY A SMALL ROOM
 AND IS MUCH SMALLER THAN THE CROWN    
 COURT.
