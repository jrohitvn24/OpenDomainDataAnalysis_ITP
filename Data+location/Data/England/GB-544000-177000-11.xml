There is an old people'S home across   
the road in Felixtowe Rd and my mum    
works over there as well. I have been  
over there and it is a bit spooky      
because when you walk past  the old    
people they stare at you until you     
disap out of the front door. My mum    
tells me quite a bit about the old     
people's home and when I do go over    
there I usually help my mum, but only  
with her ladies. You see every person  
who works there has their own three or 
four ladies if they are women or three 
or four men if they are gentlemen. I   
serve out the dinners and clean up as  
well.                                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
