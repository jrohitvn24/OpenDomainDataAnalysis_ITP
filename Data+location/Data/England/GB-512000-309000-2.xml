 The{Deepings Leisure Centre}was       
 finished in January 1976 and it now   
 employs eleven full-time and forty    
 part-time staff. The Centre is the    
 biggest building in the Deepings area 
 and it has a wide variety of sports   
 and leisure facilities for disabled   
 and able-bodied people. It is also    
 used for meetings and social          
 functions. Local schools make good use
 of the Centre during the day. At other
 times it is used mostly by those      
 people in their late teens and early  
 thirties,although younger members use 
 it a lot for swimming and skating.    
 There are also lots of other indoor   
 activities. During 1984-85 the Centre 
 cost Â£314,300 to run.Part of this     
 amount is met by the County Council   
 and the rest by membership fees.      </content>
