		<title>16A WALK IN THE NEW FOREST</title>
		<content> After eating lunch at North gate and  
 playing in a little copse we walked on
 our walk. We covered many miles of    
 different earth. We covered sand,soil,
 marsh,and bog.After going quite a way 
 we met a little old man. He was       
 walking from Surrey to visit his son  
 in Lands-end.He stopped and talked to 
 us for a while and said his wife had  
 recently died. We said goodbye and    
 went on. The walk was begining to tire
 me out and I began to drag behind with
 my friends. We walked over a hole dug 
 for the pipe being built and          
 walked through Roman Road on the way  
 back. I staggered into the school     
 gates and went for a drink of water.I 
 enjoyed my walk.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
