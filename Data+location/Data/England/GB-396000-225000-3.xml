		<content> Once again, the feature of this area  
 is farmland with scattered housing    
 including the lower slopes of Cleeve  
 Hill.There is an intensive pig farm   
 run by an ex-patriot Dane , Mr. J.    
 Mellergaard.There is also an extensive
 mushroom farm owned by Mr.Deacon.     
                                       
{Haymes (mushroom) Farm.               
  Haymes Farm is a large, well set out 
 establishment which sells about 1.5   
 million lbs.of mushroom each year.    
 These go to local retailers as well as
 Tesco and Sainsburys supermarkets.    
 Every week, 100 tons of horse manure  
 are processed in special ovens after  
 which it is spread on 'bunk-bed'      
 pallets and sown with Swiss spores.   
 Each spore measures about 3 microns.  
 The fungi are ready for picking in 6  
 days, but it would take them a year in
 an open field.                        </content>
