		<title>17Railways &amp; Victoria Viaduct</title>
		<content>   After the Civil War a series of     
{"Waggon Ways"}built by local coal     
 owners such as Lambton led from the   
 emerging pits at Philadelphia and     
 Penshaw to the river Wear so that coal
 could be sent by boat to Sunderland.  
 One of the last remaining railwaylines
 today joins Herrington Colliery with  
 the Lambton Cokeworks and follows part
 of one of these old Waggon Ways.      
   The{Victoria Viaduct}was one of the 
 wonders of the early{railway age.}It  
 is made of stone and has four main    
 arched spans and six small spans. It  
 was built of local freestone found in 
 Penshaw quarries. It was said to have 
 the largest arch in Europe at the time
 of building and stands 128ft above the
 River Wear just north of Penshaw.     
   It received its name because the    
 last stone was laid on the day of     
 Queen Victoria's Coronation.          </content>
