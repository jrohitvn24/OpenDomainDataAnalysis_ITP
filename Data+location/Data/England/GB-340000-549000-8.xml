		<title>08NURSERY _ DURDAR,CARLISLE(I)</title>
		<content> The business on Durdar Rd. was started
 by the present owner's grandfather and
 his brother in 1891.They split up and 
 his grandfather moved to the present  
 6.5 acre site in 1906.The nursery is  
 fully mechanised with a tractor,2     
 rotovators,a spading machine and a    
 grubber.A lot of plants and cuttings  
 are imported from Holland but they    
 are beginning to grow more of their   
 own each year.Four full_time people,  
 including Mr.Leslie,work about 8.5    
 hours a day.There is one part_time    
 worker also.They grow a large variety 
 of hardy plants including flowers,    
 vegetables,trees and shrubs.A lot of  
 commercially produced fertilisers and 
 composts are used as well as their    
 own composts.In a hard winter they    
 nearly always lose some plants but    
 they do not usually have many problems
 during summer droughts.               </content>
