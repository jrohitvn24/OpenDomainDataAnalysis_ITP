   Beetham Church was later dedicated  
   to St Michael and all Angels.       
   It was the centre of a vast ancient 
   parish embracing Farleton, Arnside, 
 Silverdale and Foulshaw.              
          It was rebuilt in the 14th   
 century and extended in Victoria      
 Times.                                
       This confusion of styles adds to
 its charm.                            
       Near the entrance hall is the   
 base of the ancient market cross and  
 suggests it was the centre of a market
 place.We know definately that Thomas  
 De Beetham obtained a charter for a   
 market and fair in the reign of       
 Edward Fourth in the 14th century.    
    There is an old sun dial above the 
 doorway of which only slight traces   
 remain. There is some Elizabethan     
 glass in one window.                  </content>
