		<title>10WADWORTH SCHOOL</title>
		<content>{Wadworth school}was known to have     
 existed between 1814 to 1816.In 1840  
 a new school was built, part of which 
 was a house for the headmaster. As    
 time went on they converted the house 
 into a classroom for the infants. In  
 1872 a new school masters house was   
 built. Up to 1886 the infant part had 
 its own mistress in charge, after that
 date both sections were united under  
 the master. Up till 1891 all the      
 children in the school paid one penny 
 towards their education.In 1904 the   
 West Riding took over the management  
 and in 1942 it ceased to be a Church  
 of England school. In 1973 the school 
 moved to modern buildings on the South
 East edge of the village. The old     
 building was sold by the church, it   
 had been agreed it should be returned 
 to them if it stopped being a school, 
 and became the community centre.      </content>
