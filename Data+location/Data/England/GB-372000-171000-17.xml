		<title>17VILLAGE LIFE, COLD ASHTON.</title>
		<content>    The residents of the small village 
 of Cold Ashton share most{events}with 
 the supportive neighbours of          
 Marshfield, donating the financial    
 proceeds to the Church and various    
 charities.                            
   The annual{gymkhana,}held on a      
 reident's property, is very popular.  
 However due to the poor summer it had 
 to be cancelled this year. The        
 innovation of the Sheep Dog Trials    
 proved very successful.               
   Great interest is shown in{auctions 
 and the occasional sale in aid of     
 church funds, presided over free of   
 charge by a resident, who is an       
 auctioneer.Harvest Suppers, Jumble    
 Sales,fortnightly whist clubs, Parish 
 Council meetings and Women's Institute
 all use the Cold Ashton{Church Hall,  
 centrally sited in the village.
