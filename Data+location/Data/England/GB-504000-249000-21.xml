Well a lot has changed.  Bedford is now bigger - lots more housing. Bedford College of Higher Education became DeMontfort University and is now The University of Bedfordshire.  The Tower block remains - but lots of new student accommodation has been been built.  The Norse Road area has a crematoriam and two new housing estates - one of which we live on.  There are sill many open spaces and lovely parks.  The pond at Bedford Park remains and next to it is a childrens' play area.   &lt;br />
