		<content> There are no clubs as such in Camber. 
 The Memorial Hall is the centre       
 forsuch activities as whist drives    
 darts,youth club indoor skittles, a   
 florishing pre-school play group and a
 Good Companions Club for senior       
 citizens. Apart from the play group,  
 which is currently booming, the other 
 activities do not attract a great     
 number of people.The hall was adapted 
 from a fire station as the original   
 hall was demolished during the 1939/45
 war,and the present Committee think   
 that the reason for the lack of       
 interest in activities is that it is  
 not suitable for today's needs. In    
 view of this the committee are making 
 great efforts to raise money to build 
 a new community and sports hall,in.
