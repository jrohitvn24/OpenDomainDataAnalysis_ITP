 that there are to be found mainly     
 along the main road.                  
   There are still some{isolated farm  
{houses,}but some of these have been   
 converted into superior type          
 residences.                           
   Here the impression is of{peace and 
{quiet}with just the sounds of the     
 countryside and the muffled sound of  
 traffic on the main road.             
   Farming is difficult and is confined
 to grazing for sheep,a few milk cows  
 and pasture for fattening beef        
 cattle; although  most of the land is 
 cultivated for hay for use as winter  
 feed.The fields are divided by stone  
 walls and on the higher pasture the   
 moorland is always threatening to     
 reclaim the land from cultivation.
