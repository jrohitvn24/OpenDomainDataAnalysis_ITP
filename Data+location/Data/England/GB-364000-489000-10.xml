		<title>10A HILL FARM</title>
		<content>      The most common sheep breeds in  
 the area are Swaledale and Rough      
 Fell. Cattle are usually Friesian for 
 milk. There are far more fields used  
 for sheep than for cattle. The sheep  
 meadows are cut for hay for winter    
 feed at hay-time - June/July. The     
 fells are used to grow bracken (one   
 farm is called Brackensghyll) and for 
 rough grazing. The land is never      
 likely to be used for arable farming. 
 The fields have to be fertilised quite
 heavily with slurry from the animal   
 sheds. There are a lot of trees and   
 quite a lot of planting has been done 
 which does not show on the map. The   
 fell top is still common land and the 
 farms on the edge have grazing rights.
 The animals are brought down for      
 shelter in the winter from October    
 to April.
