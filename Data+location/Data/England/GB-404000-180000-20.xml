 The Western Region main line from     
 Swindon to Bath and Bristol passes    
 through Wootton Bassett,although the  
 town does not have a station of its   
 own.A campaign to re-open the station 
 for a commuter train service to       
 Swindon has been started this year.The
 junction of lines to Bath &amp; Bristol is
 west of the old station site. These   
 routes are used by high speed Inter-  
 City 125 trains.                      
{ Roads around Wootton Bassett.}       
 Wootton Bassett High Street is part of
 the A3102 road that links the town to 
 Swindon and the M4 to the east and    
 Lyneham &amp; Chippenham to the south     
 west.
