		<content> Simon says that the grown-ups have    
 many things to do in Wolvey.          
 "My dad is on the committee of Wolvey 
 Cricket{CLUB.}They have their ground  
 and pavilion in the village{PLAYING   
{FIELDS}run by the Wolvey Playing      
 Fields Association."                  
 Mrs. Holt tells us about the{WOMEN'S  
{INSTITUTE}in Wolvey."It started on 7th
 April 1943 with 132 members. Five of  
 the original members still belong. The
 membership is now 42 and they meet in 
 the Village Hall once a month."       
 The{BOWLING CLUB}has Mrs. Patterson on
 the committee and she says "It is not 
 crown green but flat green bowling.We 
 have an active membership and we play 
 many local clubs as well as some      
 further afield."
