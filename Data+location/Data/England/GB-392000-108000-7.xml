		<title>07INTERVIEW WITH RESIDENT</title>
		<content> We interviewed an old lady called     
 Margaret who said she first moved     
 into the village 40 years ago.The     
 village was much busier then as it    
 was still wartime and the American    
 Army Camp was just up the road.She    
 remembered 100's of American soldiers 
 queing up outside the Langton Arms    
 pub waiting for it to open.Margaret   
 remembers the bomb shelter in the pub 
 garden.After the war the soldiers left
 and the village became quieter with   
 mostly farm workers living in the     
 cottages.there was a little school    
 next to the church but this was later 
 closed down.There was also a village  
 hall where there used to be regular   
 concerts and meetings.Now the village 
 has changed and a lot of outsiders    
 have bought houses and they have      
 become very expensive,up to Â£100,000.
