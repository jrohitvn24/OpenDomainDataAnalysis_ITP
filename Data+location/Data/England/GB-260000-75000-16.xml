		<title>16Tourist Spots at Two Bridges</title>
		<content>    There are not many tourist spots in
 the area exept for a few places, these
 being Two Bridges, Crockern Tor,      
 Wistman's Wood and around the Cherry  
 Brook Hotel.                          
                                       
    At Two Bridges there is a Hotel    
 and a Restaurant with a pleasant      
 picnic area outside beside the West   
 Dart River.                           
                                       
    Crockern Tor is associated with the
 ancient Tinners or Stanners. The Tor  
 is well known because it was the      
 meeting place of the Stannery         
 Parliament and is very close to the   
 road.                                 
                                       
    Below Crockern Tor is the Cherry   
 Broock Hotel this is very a small     
 place,it is on the very road where the
 hairy hands struck.                   </content>
