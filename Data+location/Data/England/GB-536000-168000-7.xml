		<content> Many games are played in Beckenham but
 there are always favourites.          
 The majority of games are learnt in   
 the playground at school and go on for
 years.                                
   Young children,especially girls,seem
 to like imaginary games.They like to  
 play "mummies and daddies".Boys prefer
 "cowboys and indians"although from an 
 early age they like to play football. 
 Another favourite with young children 
 is "what's the time Mr Wolf?"         
    "IT" is a game where someone is    
 chosen to be "it".On the word go ,the 
 other children try to get as far      
 towards the person as possible before 
 he turns round and sees them          
 moving.The first person to touch them 
 is next to be on "it".Similar games   
 are"stick in the mud","bulldog"and    
 "chase".
