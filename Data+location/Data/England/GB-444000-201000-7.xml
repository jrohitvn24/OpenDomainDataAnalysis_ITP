		<content>      We  visited a lady aged 87 living
 on the old people's estate.  These are
 bungalows,  small  but  compact,  well
 decorated  and cheerful looking.  They
 contain  four  rooms:-lounge, bedroom,
 kitchen  and  bathroom.   In  the hall
 there  is   an {intercom}  system  for
 calling  the  Warden and in every room
 there  is an emergency bell-pull.  The
 bungalows  are  built as semi-detached
 pairs linked by open plan lawns at the
 front  but  divided into small gardens
 at  the  rear.   A neighbour cares for
 our  lady's  garden  now  that  she is
 incapable  of  doing it herself.  None
 of  the  bungalows has a garage; there
 are blocks of garages at either end of
 the  crescent.   Recently  young  boys
 have  been gathering there with  their
 motorbikes   causing  a  nuisance   by
 revving the engines and tearing  round
 the block.                            </content>
