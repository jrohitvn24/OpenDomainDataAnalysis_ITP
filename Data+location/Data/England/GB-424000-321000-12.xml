		<title>12Burton "Statutes" Fair</title>
		<content>     The Fair is usually held in early 
October in the Market Place by         
St.Modwen's Church.                    
     When I walk across the (Ferry)    
bridge I can see the big wheel and it  
is good - we go up high.   Then we go  
on the bumper cars and we crash into   
other cars and some crash into ours.   
     It is best in the evening for all 
the lights are on.                     
     You can hear loud noises and music
and people screaming.                  
     I always go and buy a coconut, I  
like the milk out of the coconut.      
     I went where you pay 20p and get a
ticket and open it, if it's an odd     
number you win an enormous Teddy, but I
lost so I chose a small carrot.   So   
you never lose at all!                 
     My brother, sister and me spent   
all our money so we went home.
