 The house I live in is about 300 years
 old.It was originally a farmhouse,but 
 I do not know how long it has been a  
 public house.It stands on an acre of  
 land,part of which is a car park.Our  
 living accommadation is a lounge,three
 bedrooms,bathroom and kitchen.The     
 business has one very large bar which 
 used to be two bars,a pool room and a 
 skittle alley.Under the alley are     
 three sheds and a garage_these used to
 be stables with living quarters       
 above.My Dad buys the beer and spirits
 from the Bass depot at Chard.We sell  
 farmhouse cider we get from Buckland  
 St.Mary.We have seven skittle         
 teams,three dart teams and two pool   
 teams.These teams are important to us 
 in the Winter when our income falls.
