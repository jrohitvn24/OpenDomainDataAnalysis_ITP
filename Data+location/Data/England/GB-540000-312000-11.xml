		<title>11A DAY ON MISS BROWNS FARM</title>
		<content>{Miss Brown}wakes at 6 O'clock, listens
 to the{farming}programme on the radio,
 rises at 6_30, and then has breakfast.
 After the necessary house chores, she 
 then feeds the various houses of hens,
 ducks,geese and peacocks. She then    
 prepares the food for the cows and    
 lets them into their boxes containing 
 the calves which are being reared     
 either for the beef market or to be   
 retained for herd replacement.The     
 remainder of the morning is           
 occasionally taken up by hand sowing  
 grass seed to supplement a rather poor
 pasture. Late in the afternoon, the   
 chickens are fed and the eggs are     
 collected. After tea,the cows and     
 calves have to be fed again;then at   
 dusk the poultry have to be shut up to
 prevent the foxes in the area from    
 making a meal of them.
