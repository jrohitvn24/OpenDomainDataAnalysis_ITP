		<title>03Cannington Park, Cannington</title>
		<content> Near the village is a rough hill known
 as Cannington Park. It is 80 metres   
 high and is covered with trees and    
 shrubland. The crest of the hill is   
 encircled by the ditches of an Iron   
 Age  camp. The  Ministry of Works     
 carried out an excavation in 1963     
 because quarrying was about to destroy
 the remaining portion of this ancient 
 cemeteny, some 400 skeletons were     
 removed and it was proved to be a     
 burial ground which had been in use   
 from Romen Times until about 650 A.D. 
 Before  quarrying began in the early  
 19th Century it is assumed that there 
 must have been two or even three      
 thousand burials in this field.
