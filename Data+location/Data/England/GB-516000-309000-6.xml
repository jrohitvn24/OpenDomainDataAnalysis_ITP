		<title>06DEEPING ST.JAMES SIGNAL BOX</title>
		<content>   The signal box is situated about one
 and a half miles out of the village   
 where the B1166 crosses the line.There
 is no longer a station.It was closed  
 down because it was not used much.The 
 station masters house is now a private
 dwelling.                             
    About 40 trains go past each day. A
 few are local passenger trains running
 between Spalding and Peterborough. The
 rest are freight trains coming from   
 Peterborough, Lincoln, Boston,and as  
 far north as Doncaster.The nearest    
 main line is the London and North     
 Eastern railway.                      
  When a bell rings the crossing keeper
 has 5 minutes in which to close the   
 gates and change all the signals to   
 green.Inside the signal box it is     
 fairly small. There are big levers    
 which operate the signals and points.
