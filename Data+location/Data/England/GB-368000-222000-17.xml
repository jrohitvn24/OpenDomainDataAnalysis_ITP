 is that of{Chicory.}First grown in    
 1974, the area now covered by it is   
 some 18 acres, much of which is rented
 As a rotation system is used, not all 
 the land lies within our block in any 
 one season.                           
{ Chicory}is a{salad crop}and is first 
 sown out of doors in the Spring. It is
 brought indoors in the Autumn and is  
 forced under warm, dark conditions.   
 Harvesting begins in November and     
 continues until April. The entire crop
 is sold to one of the big supermarket 
 chains (Waitrose) who distibute it    
 round the country.                    
  Demand is increasing annually, which 
 is encouraging for the producer as he 
 is the only known grower in the       
 country. At present the crop provides 
 work for six people.
