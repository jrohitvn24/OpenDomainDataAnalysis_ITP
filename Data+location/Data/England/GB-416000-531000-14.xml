		<title>14A DAY IN THE LIFE OF LISA</title>
		<content> I get up at 8 o'clock and I get ready 
 for school.At school we do Maths but I
 am not very good at that and I always 
 get into trouble for not paying       
 attention.We do lots of other         
 interesting things at school.At       
 lunchtime I bring sandwiches, but some
 people have a school meal. On Monday  
 we go swimming with Mr.Buxton and     
 every year we have a swimming gala.On 
 Thursday I go for music lessons with  
 Mr.Watson. .On Saturday I go to a     
 Brass Band with my friends and we play
 with other musicians.I arrive home    
 from school at about 3.30pm and when I
 come home I get changed and play my   
 Baritone for about 15 minutes and then
 I have my tea and play with my friend 
 Sarah.Usually we play on the swings   
 and make grass houses on the green.I  
 usually go in at about 8o'clock &amp; go  
 to bed at 9.30pm.                     </content>
