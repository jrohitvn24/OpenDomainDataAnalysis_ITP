		<content>  There are not many recreational      
 facilities in the area we are         
 studying. The following recreational  
 facilities are within this D-Block:   
{Wrecclesham Recreation Ground}in      
 which many club activities like rugby,
 football,cricket and tennis take      
 place.                                
{The Memorial Ground}is similar with   
 football clubs but no cricket         
 clubs.There are also many open spaces 
 with facilities for the younger       
 generation:such as swings and slides. 
    {FARNHAM RUGBY CLUB                
 The Rugby Club meet at Wrecclesham    
 Recreation Ground in Westfield Lane.  
 About 200 children and 80 adults play 
 rugby every weekend.Another 50 adults 
 are regular social members.The clubs  
 badge is a Bishops Mitre,because the  
 founding members were regulars at the 
 Mitre pub in Farnham.                 </content>
