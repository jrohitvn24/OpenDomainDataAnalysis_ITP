		<title>15Holidays in Sand Bay &amp; WSM</title>
		<content> I think people come to Sand Bay and   
 Weston-super-Mare for their holidays  
 because it is a change from their own 
 homes.There are a few amenities in    
 Weston like the tropicana .The Grand  
 Pier is also  a big attraction.If     
 people live in cities like London and 
 Birmingham they want to get away to   
 the sea and sand.Although there is a  
 lot of mud and the tide is hardly in  
 it is quite a nice holiday resort.    
 There are a lot of caravan sites here.
 At Sand Bay there is a large holiday  
 camp called Pontins which was built   
 before the 2nd World War.It was taken 
 over in 1947 by Bass,a company of     
 brewers.Pontins is very busy in the   
 summer and people enjoy it so much    
 that they go again.People usually stay
 a week and enjoy many activities.     
 Pontins is just for adults and it can 
 take 650 guests.                      </content>
