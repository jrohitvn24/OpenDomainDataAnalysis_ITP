		<content> Rough Close is the camp site of the   
 City of Coventry Scout County. It is  
 43 acres-15 acres of open land, the   
 rest woodland. The cub field has a    
 small totem pole in the centre. The   
 land was given to scouting by a       
 wealthy Canadian businessman about 20 
 to 30 years ago. It is used for       
 camping by scouts, cubs and guides    
 from all over the country. It is also 
 used for leader training, county and  
 district events and by different      
 groups for outdoor activities. Our    
 pack goes in the summer for putting up
 tents, fire-lighting and cooking. The 
 scouts own open air chapel is on site 
 holding services at 11.30a.m. and 12  
 noon on Sundays. As well as cabins,   
 first aid hut, washing facilities,    
 bridging pool and camp fire circle
