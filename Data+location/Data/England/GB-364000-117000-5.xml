		<title>05Traffic Survey</title>
		<content> We made a traffic survey of Milborne  
 Port over 2 days.Taking 30 minutes    
 each time.We took the survey along the
 side of the A30.                      
 We split into two groups,one group    
 counting the traffic to Salisbury and 
 the other group counting the traffic  
 to Sherborne.                         
 We found that there was more traffic  
 on the second day,a Friday,than on the
 first day,but there was little        
 difference between the Salisbury and  
 Sherborne traffic.                    
 Most vehicles were cars some of which 
 were holiday traffic.We had imagined  
 that there would be much more traffic 
 than there was.But we noticed that    
 most of the vehicles were exceeding   
 the speed limit.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
