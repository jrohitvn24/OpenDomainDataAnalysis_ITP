		<title>16THE NEW SHOPPING CENTRE,INCE</title>
		<content>{TRADE}- In December 1984 the new      
 Smithy Green Shopping Centre opened.  
 After years of neglect this represents
 a new lease of life for trade in the  
 area especially when associated with  
 the new housing development.          
{MATERIALS}- The Centre is made of     
 distinctive red brick, the roof tiles 
 are a black compound and the roof     
 frames are made of wood.              
{FACILITIES}- When finally complete    
 there will be a number a shops (some  
 of which are already open), a library 
 and a bank.                           
{COMMENTS}- "I think the library will  
 save a lot of travelling particularly 
 for O.A.P's as the nearest one is two 
 miles away." "The shops are clean and 
 pleasant-smelling" "The take-away is a
 good idea; the chicken is nice and    
 crispy and the people who go at       
 night are mainly young".              </content>
