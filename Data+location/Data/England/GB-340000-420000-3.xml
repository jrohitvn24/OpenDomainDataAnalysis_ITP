		<title>03 Ecology-The Ribble Marshes</title>
		<content>                                       
    The Ribble Marshes national nature 
reserve covers 2302 hectares of salt   
marsh and mudflats. About half the area
is vegetated salt marsh ("greenmarsh") 
on which cattle graze, the remaining   
half being mud and sand flats. The big 
bank was built in 1890,and there are   
20-30,000 birds visiting the estuaries,
which are a protected habitat. 1.75    
million pounds was paid to Mr.Herimar, 
the previous owner.                    
    Knots, Bar-tailed Godwits,and      
Dunlin are Autumn visitors,as well as  
some 10-20,000 Wigeons,Oystercatchers, 
Pintails,Redshanks,and Teals.          
    From May to September some 900 head
of cattle are grazed on the marsh,     
brought from as far as Leyland. The    
grazng animals occasionally destroy the
nests of birds by treading on them.
