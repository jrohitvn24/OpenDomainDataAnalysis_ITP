		<title>07GEDNEY CHURCH END SCHOOL 1</title>
		<content> ]This school was built about 1862 by  
 the then vicar of Gedney , William    
 Rogers . It was added to in 1876 and  
 various additions and improvements    
 have been made since .                
    Until just after the second World  
 War children came here until they left
 school at 14 years of age . Now       
 children come as " rising five's " and
 leave before their twelfth birthday . 
    Pupils then go to the Peele County 
 Secondary School in Long Sutton or ,  
 after selection examination , to the  
 Spalding Boys' Grammar School or the  
 Spalding Girls' High School.          
    There are about 70 children at     
 Gedney Church End School and there are
 three teachers .                      
    Until 1967 there was a school in   
 Gedney Dyke but this was closed when  
 numbers on roll fell and the children 
 from that village now travel on a bus </content>
