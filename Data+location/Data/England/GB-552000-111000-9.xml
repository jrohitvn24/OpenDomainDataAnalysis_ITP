		<title>09DICKER DAY-THE CARNIVAL</title>
		<content> Being a pupil at St. Bede's School, I 
was invited to participate in Â£Dicker  
Day'. In fact this annual event takes  
place in our school grounds every three
years.                                 
 The date was Saturday July the 6th    
1985 and many Dicker folks and         
townspeople came to enjoy a fun day out
in the country. The proceeds of the    
carnival were devoted to guide dogs for
the blind and local charities. The     
festival started off with a grand      
procession at 1.45 pm. The carnival was
declared open by the Dicker King and   
Queen. There were competitions like    
dog shows, tug of war, archery,        
childrens sports and side shows. At    
4 pm the draw was made for the grand   
lottery for which there were prizes.   
Admission fee was adults 20p, children 
10p and parking free.
