		<content> In the Langford Budville area  we only
 have one Post Office which sells a few
 groceries, cigarettes, sweets, ice-   
 creams and a little stationary. At the
 Post Office counter stamps can be     
 bought, parcels sent, and money       
 obtained for pensions, and from       
 savings.                              
 A mobile baker and fishman visit the  
 village and the surrounding area. The 
 baker comes twice a week and the      
 fishman only once. The baker does not 
 just sell bread but also cakes, crisps
 and a few sweets.                     
 The milkman delivers milk daily to    
 everyone's house and also sells       
 groceries. In the summer an ice-cream 
 van visits the village every day just 
 when the children come out of school. 
 Every three weeks a travelling library
 stops in each village for people to   
 exchange the books they have borrowed.</content>
