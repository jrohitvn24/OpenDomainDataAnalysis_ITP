		<title>07Wethersfield Riding Stables</title>
		<content> The stables are one of the few        
 recreation facilities in our square.  
 The stables consist of 8 acres of     
 land with 12 horses (9 mares,3        
 geldings) and one employed person     
 apart from the owner.                 
 The owner has had the stables for 4   
 years and when she wishes to obtain   
 horses she buys, but does not breed   
 them. In the winter it costs Â£10 a    
 week to keep a horse of 15 hands.     
 The horses eat bran, barley, oats,    
 sugarbeet and hay, and in summer they 
 eat grass as additionial foodstuff.   
 The owner trained as an instructor and
 then passed an exam to go into        
 partnership with the previous owner of
 the stables. Although the business is 
 not profitable, it survives and the   
 daughter of the owner will inherit it 
 unless it is sold.
