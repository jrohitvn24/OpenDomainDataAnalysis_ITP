		<content>  Mr. Robert Hanvey was born in        
 Blennerhasset in 1900 and has lived   
 there all his life. He has seen lots  
 of changes since he was a boy. Now the
 school has only 24 pupils, when he    
 went there were 126. They all wore    
 clogs and the girls wore aprons.      
  There was no running water in the    
 village, the people used the three    
 village pumps. There was no           
 electricity either, just oil lamps and
 candles. Most of the people in the    
 village were employed there, on the   
 farms, at the nearby mine or at trades
 in the village.                       
  His father had a cobbler's shop      
 there, and when he left school he     
 worked there too. The building is     
 still standing, but is just a         
 storeroom today.                      
  Mr. Hanvey enjoys living in the      
 village because it is peaceful.       </content>
