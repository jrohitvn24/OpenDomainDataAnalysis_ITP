		<title>20ST. ALBAN'S CHURCH</title>
		<content> The original St. Alban's Church was   
 built in St. Alban's Road, shortly    
 after the end of the second World War.
 It was rebuilt on its present site at 
 Bartons Road in 1966. The Parish      
 boundary follows the Havant District  
 boundary to the east and north and    
 cuts south to follow the line of the  
 Petersfield Road. The population of   
 the area seems to be getting older,   
 and this is reflected in the increase 
 in the numbers of funerals performed  
 at the Church, and the fewer baptisms 
 undertaken. The Church runs outings   
 for the elderly and these are very    
 popular.                              
                                       
                                       
 This work was produced by members of  
 the 3rd Havant Scout Group of Meyrick 
 Road, Havant.
