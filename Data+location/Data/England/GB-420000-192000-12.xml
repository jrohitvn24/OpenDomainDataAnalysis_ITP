		<content> Everybody starts school at the age of 
 5 yrs.They go to juniors at 7yrs.At 11
 yrs they go to comprehensive school   
 until they are 16 yrs. Schools start  
 at 9am and finish at 3pm or 3.30pm.   
 Most schools have a hall but the      
 secondary school has 3; 1 for eating, 
 1 for assemblies  and 1 for gym.      
{      A BOY'S DAY AT SCHOOL           
 I arrive at school at 5 mins to 9.    
 First we have assembly and then an    
 hour of maths. Playtime lasts 15      
 minutes and after that we have private
 reading. The teacher often reads us a 
 story and then we do English. I go    
 home for dinner which lasts an hour.  
 After dinner we do topic or art,music,
 P.E. or games. I do not have to wear  
 school uniform but some do.
