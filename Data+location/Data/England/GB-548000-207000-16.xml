		<content> Mr. Padfield, the owner of ROLLS FARM 
 has taken every opportunity to benefit
 from developments in agricultural     
 science &amp; associated technology.      
 Precision farming &amp; environmental     
 control might well describe his       
 approach. Extensive field drainage has
 been undertaken to lower the winter   
 water table, thus providing more      
 suitable early growth conditions for  
 crops in that season.This is balanced 
 by use of high pressure irrigation    
 aerial jet when natural water is      
 insufficient. Rainfall cannot be      
 controlled but to some extent land    
 water can and soil temperature and    
 aeration factors are also influenced. 
 Rate &amp; type of growth are vital parts 
 of precision arable farming &amp; the need
 to make the most of marketing         
 opportunities within E.E.C.           
 regulations.                          </content>
