		<content> Many people spend their holidays      
 in the area,mainly at the caravan     
 sites where they can hire a caravan   
 and self cater by cooking their own   
 meals.This is popular with parents    
 with young children.Other people bring
 their own caravans and stay on local  
 farms where the farmers keep a field  
 especially for caravans.The farms     
 usually sell farm produce like eggs   
 and vegetables. The main reason for   
 people holidaying in the Bognor area  
 is the seaside,and the proximity to   
 large interesting cities like         
 Brighton,Chichester, London and       
 Portsmouth.
