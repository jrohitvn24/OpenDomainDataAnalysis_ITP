		<content> Each August Bank Holiday Monday a Fete
 is held in Methwold on the Recreation 
 ground. Floats are decorated by       
 various organisations in the village  
 and are paraded through the streets   
 before the fete is officially opened  
 by a well-known personality.          
     Each year the fete has a special  
 theme, in 1984 it was "The 40th       
 Anniversary of Methwold Airfield" and 
 in 1985 it was "The international year
 of youth."                            
      There is a fancy dress           
 competition, races and a great variety
 of sideshows. There is entertainment  
 in the centre ring throughout the     
 afternoon,i.e.B.M.X.bike display,
