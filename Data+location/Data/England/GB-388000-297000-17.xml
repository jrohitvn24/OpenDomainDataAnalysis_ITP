		<content>At the age of two and a half years I   
attended a play group at a community   
centre.It was not compulsory but the   
aim was to be able to mix with others. 
One went in the mporning and played    
with toys like lego,toy building       
bricks,a dolls house and slide. I      
stayed there until I was three and a   
half years old. I then went to a       
nursery school until I was four and a  
half years old. There I made many      
friends with whom I still play. On my  
first day I wasn't shy and didn't cry  
like most children because I had been  
to a playgroup. One either went for the
morning or for the afternoon. There    
were many toys to play with and nearly 
everyday we learnt a little about      
reading and writing. We also had a     
piece of apple and a drink of milk     
while being read a story.
