		<title>04Gloucester Cattle Market.</title>
		<content> Before the Cattle Market was built the
 land it was built on was part of the  
 flood plain of the River Severn.It    
 was situated to the east of the       
 Eastern Channel of the River Severn on
 land known as Mean Ham.It was used as 
 the City rubbish tip until the level  
 of the land was raised sufficiently   
 for the Market to be built.Started in 
 1955 it was completed in 1958.        
   On a site  of 30 acres the Market is
 a meeting place for farmers,buyers and
 general public.It has become the      
 biggest Market in the Gloucester area 
 and the biggest barren cow market in  
 the country.The main animals dealt    
 with at Gloucester Market are         
 cattle(calves) sheep (lambs) pigs     
 (piglets).The top prices for cows are 
 for Friesian Â£760.00 Hereford         
 Â£548.00 Charolais Â£490.00 Ayrshire    
 Â£325.00 C.I.Â£270.00.                  </content>
