 heated and turned into butter. It is  
 drained, cut inpieces and shaped.     
 Lastly the man squeezes off a handful,
 weighs it in 250g pieces and wraps    
 each portion.{This is all done by     
{hand. QUICKE'S MATURE CHEDDAR CHEESE. 
 Firstly the curds and whey{are stirred
{in large vats by huge machine whisks. 
 The mixture is heated to a high       
 temperature to kill off germs. Then   
 the{whey is drained for pig food}and  
 the curd cheese is placed in moulds.  
{Fine cloth is wrapped round each to   
{make the rind.}It must not be         
 punctured otherwise the cheese goes   
 mouldy.The cheeses,{worth Â£60 each,   
{are stored in racks, turned daily and 
{kept for 9 months.}Most of the cheese 
 is sold to Marks and Spencer, the rest
 to small shops.
