		<content> New Mills lies on two seperate sides  
 of the valley. It used to be seperated
 by the river but they built the Union 
 Bridge and last year we celebrated the
 centenary.  There were childrens      
 choirs and eight bands.               
 The bridge cost Â£4,000 to build. It   
 was built in 1883 and was opened in   
 1884, on June 7th. The Bridge scans   
 The Torrs, a 75 feet deep gorge formed
 as a result of the Ice Age.           
 The Torrs has been reclaimed and now  
 is an ammenity. The town council has  
 plans to provide picnic tables down   
 The Torrs. The council has linked the 
 network of riverside paths in New     
 Mills with those further down the Goyt
 Valley.
