		<title>18Traffic in Banbury</title>
		<content>  The main way to travel in Banbury is 
by car.In Banbury we have one          
multi-storey car park, two other large 
car parks and lots of small places to  
park along the side of road.           
  We do have a lot of traffic jams     
especially around the cross, the       
traffic lights at the junction of      
Warwick Rd, Southam Rd,Castle St and   
North Bar and on the railway bridge    
from Grimsbury.                        
  We have one bus station where you can
catch buses to another part of Banbury 
or to another town. There are bus stops
dotted all around the town so that     
people can get from the town centre to 
the housing estates.                   
  We also have one railway station     
from which trains often travel to      
Oxford, London, Birmingham and other   
places.
