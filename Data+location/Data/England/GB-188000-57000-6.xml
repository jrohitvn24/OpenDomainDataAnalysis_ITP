		<content> There are no theatres,cinemas,operas  
 or the like in the district.          
 To go to the cinema you have to go to 
 Truro,Newquay or St.Austell and often,
 especially in the summer,they are     
 showing the same film.                
 The nearest real live theatre is the  
 Theatre Royal at Plymouth,but Newquay 
 has shows for the tourists in the     
 summer.                               
 There is a pantomime put on in Indian 
 Queens every year and lots of children
 from the school are involved.It is    
 very good.                            
 There is a silver band who hold a week
 of activities in July every year.The  
 highlight is the carnival.            
 In October there is a Music Festival  
 held in the local Victory Hall where  
 all entrants are judged.
