		<title>04A TRIP TO STROOD</title>
		<content>  Iam a visitor from America.  I came  
to Strood because I have friends here. 
It is very interesting.                
TUESDAY                                
  I got up at 9 a.m to go swimming at  
Strood Swimming Pool.  This was very   
enjoyable.  I had a go at diving off   
the high board.  After this we drove   
down the town to do a spot of shopping.
We went into Shoppers Paradise, they   
have this new system there, all they   
have to do is pass the item that is    
being brought across a hole with a     
cross (called a Bar Code Reader) on it 
and the price comes up on the till.  We
decided to have dinner in the Wimpy    
where we sat down and ordered          
cheeseburger and chips with a          
chocolate milkshake and the waiter     
brought us these.                      
                                       
                                       </content>
