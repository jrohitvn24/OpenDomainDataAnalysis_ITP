		<content> The West Allen runs from N to S       
 through the centre of the block.   The
 E bank of the dale is steep and partly
 wooded throughout.   The western side 
 becoms steeper towards the N.   In the
 centre of the block, Whitfield Hall   
 stands on a raised allured plain      
 between Blaeberry Burn, Carrs Burn and
 the West Allen.   The parkland is used
 for grazing, but is still recognizably
 landscaped.   Whitfield village       
 (formarly Bear's Bridge) stands on the
 bank of the West Allen; its post      
 office and police house serve NW      
 Allendale.   The area is intensively  
 farmed; sheep and cattle are raised   
 and hay is harvested except in the    
 extreme NW and SE of the block, where 
 there is rough fell grazing.          
 Forestry is also an important         
 industry.
