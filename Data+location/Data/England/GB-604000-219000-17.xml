		<title>17Health in Alresford</title>
		<content> Alresford has no medical facilities of
 its own, there being neither a        
 dentists surgery, doctors surgery nor 
 a pharmacy in the village. Residents  
 have to register with a doctor in     
 Wivenhoe, Brightlingsea or Colchester,
 and must travel to these places, or   
 call a doctor out from them, even in  
 an emergency.This has worried some    
 people who have fought to get a       
 doctor's surgery in the village, but  
 their pleas have been turned down.It  
 is generally considered that since    
 Wivenhoe is so near, there is no need 
 for Alresford to have its own doctor. 
  There is, however, a local Health    
 Visitor, who comes to the village and 
 talks and advises such people as the  
 Young Wives; a group of mums with     
 pre-school age children who meet      
 fortnightly.
