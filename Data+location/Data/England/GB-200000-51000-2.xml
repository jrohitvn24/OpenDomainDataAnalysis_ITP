		<content>  On a usual Wednesday,I jump out of my
 bunk bed at about 7:45 am and go down 
 for a breakfast of Sugar Puffs.When   
 Mum calls I get in the bath,wash and  
 get dried and put on my socks,pants,  
 trousers,shirt and jumper.By now it's 
 about 8:50 am.Ten minutes to school.So
 I pick up my bag and leave my town    
 house.In school,the first thing is    
 registration and reading.Then we do   
 maths.After a 15 minute break we do   
 group work and story reading as a     
 class.When it's 12:00 pm I go for     
 dinner.I go up to the counter and     
 choose my dinner_let's say a hot dog, 
 beans and ice_cream_eat it,clear the  
 table and go out for break.Afternoon  
 is usually the same as the morning    
 until 3:30 pm when I go home and watch
 TV until Dad picks me up in his car   
 and takes me to his house where I have
 dinner and watch TV until bedtime.    </content>
