		<title>15HOME LIFE IN WOLSTON 2.</title>
		<content> A child wrote "Years ago, my{house was
{a brewery.}It was built in 1810 and   
 changed into a house in 1908. My      
 bedroom was the loft and in my dad's  
 workshop there is still a slit in the 
 floor where they used to drain the    
 barrels. Under my road, Brook Street, 
 there are still cobbles." About his   
 Saturday, a boy wrote "I woke up at   
 6.30 a.m. because the{hamster}was     
 going mad on its wheel. I then got up 
 at 9 a.m. to watch Scooby Doo and then
 got dressed and called for my friend. 
 We played Ratatat Ginger: nearly got  
 caught! Some more friends came to play
 Offground Tig and then we had lunch, a
 salad sandwich. My friends and I      
 played follow my leader on{bicycles   
 and went ten times round the block. I 
 watched television all evening." Some 
 children play on{roller skates,}or    
 with dolls and a lot like horses.     </content>
