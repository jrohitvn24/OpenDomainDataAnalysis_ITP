 A form of local government has been in
 existence since the 8th. century. An  
 important change was the grouping of  
 parishes to administer the Poor Law.  
 The next major change was the Local   
 Government Act 1894, which included   
 the creation of Parish Councils and   
 the separation of the Church and the  
 State for local government control.   
 The present operation was introduced  
 on 1st. April 1974 as a result of the 
 1972 Act. This Act gave the Parish    
 Council the right to be notified of   
 planning applications so that they can
 make recomendation to the District    
 Council regarding these. The Poll for 
 the election is every four years and  
 the Parish Council can be regarded as 
 an organ of local opinion.
