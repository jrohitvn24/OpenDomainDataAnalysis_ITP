 I like Tuesdays best of the 5 school  
days because we have apparatus and we  
have the ropes and the wallbars the big
roll mat and the boxes.I get up at half
past 6 in the morning and get dressed  
have breakfast get ready for school put
my coat on and get my satchel. School  
starts at 9 O'clock Mrs Brooks does the
register and we go to assembly. I am   
7 years old and my name is Jonathan    
Garner . School finishes at 3 O'clock. 
And I go to my child minder's and watch
TV. At 4 O'clock children's ITV is on  
and I  watch it .Mum comes back at  5  
O'clock and takes us home and we have  
tea. Dad comes home at 7 O'clock.
