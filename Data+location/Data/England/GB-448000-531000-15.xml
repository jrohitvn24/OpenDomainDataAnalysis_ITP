		<content>{5. What can adults do?} Adults can    
 enjoy the walks and flowers in the    
 public parks.  There are many pubs,   
 clubs and restaurants for social      
 gatherings.  Ladies can join the      
 Townswomen's Guilds which hold        
 monthly meetings in several areas of  
 Hartlepool.  The International        
 Toastmistresses Club have a branch in 
 the town which meets at Wilton Grange.
 Toc H has two branches.  Older        
 gentlemen can meet with the Retired   
 Mens Forum each week in the Athenaeum.
 Keen gardeners can join the Gardeners 
 Guild which gives advice on soil and  
 plants to grow in Hartlepool and      
 encourages the tenants of the         
 allotments in their endeavours.  Many 
 men and ladies play bowls indoor in   
 winter and in various public parks in 
 the summer.
