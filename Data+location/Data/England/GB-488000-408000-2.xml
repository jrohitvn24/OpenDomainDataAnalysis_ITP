		<title>02The Mayor of Scunthorpe</title>
		<content>  In May we visited the Mayor of       
 Scunthorpe,{Mrs Brenda Kirk.}We walked
 to the Civic Centre and she showed us 
 round the Mayor's rooms and then      
 talked about her year in office.      
  I asked her if she had ever wished   
 she was not the mayor and she replied 
 that she was often very tired. She    
 liked visiting children in schools,   
 and she fetched handicapped and       
 disabled people to see her in the     
 Civic Centre in her large, black car. 
  She was very proud of Scunthorpe,    
 especially the parks and gardens, but 
 she wished that more jobs for men     
 could be created. Many of our fathers 
 have no jobs because one of the       
 steelworks has closed down.           
  She showed us her robes, trimmed with
 velvet and mink, and we put them on.  
 The Mayor wears a chain made of gold  
 and enamel round her neck.            </content>
