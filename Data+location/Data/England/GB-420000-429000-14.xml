		<title>14SCHOLE BROOK FARM, TONG</title>
		<content>  I own 224 acres of land in Tong and  
 rent 100.  Since the new EEC          
 regulations in l984 I have changed    
 from dairy farming to rearing beef    
 cattle and sheep.  Apart from 52 acres
 of rough grazing all the land is good 
 pasture land and I estimate that I    
 shall produce 200 tons of silage  and 
 l2000 bales of hay this year.  I buy  
 barley straw for eating and bedding.  
 In addition I have 40,000 laying hens 
 in batteries and run a registered egg 
 packing station.  I buy the corn for  
 the hens.  I kept two Friesian cows   
 which provide milk for both my family 
 and my brother's; we give the surplus 
 milk to the few pigs we keep.         
   The majority of the cattle go  to   
 Huddersfield market but the           
 underweight ones are sold at York to  
 cereal farmers for fattening up.  I   
 have  six men and two part time women.</content>
