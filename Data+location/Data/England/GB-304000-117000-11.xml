		<title>11WATER SUPPLY</title>
		<content> For many years Holcombe Rogus has had 
 a real problem because of a shortage  
 of water.We think that this must have 
 been a problem for many centuries as  
 there is only one small stream near   
 the village and there are several     
 places where water fountains have been
 built into the village walls.The real 
 problem in recent times is that the   
 village is only fed by a 5 centimetre 
 water main and the reservoir which    
 supplied the village was 9 miles away 
 and almost exactly the same height as 
 our village.This meant that even when 
 we filled our small school swimming   
 pool,automatic washing machines       
 in the village would often            
 refuse to work.Two years ago,South    
 West Water fixed up a new bore hole at
 Hockworthy to supply us with          
 water.This now works well.
