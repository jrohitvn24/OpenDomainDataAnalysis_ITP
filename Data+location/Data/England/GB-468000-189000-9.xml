		<content>There are two group practices serving  
this area, one at Watlington and one at
Nettlebed.  There is no official       
catchment area for these practices, but
doctors try to arrange matters to avoid
unnecessary travelling for themselves  
or patients.  Surgeries are open some  
time everyday except Saturday and      
Sunday for patients to attend by       
appointment.  Doctors make home visits 
when people are too ill or infirm to go
to the surgery.  District nurses,      
midwives and health visitors make home 
visits when needed.  The nurses are    
based with the group practice and work 
with the doctors.  Doctors can be      
contacted by telephone throughout the  
day and night for emergency calls.     
Doctors organise clinics for ante-natal
and post-natal care and for mothers    
with babies and toddlers.
