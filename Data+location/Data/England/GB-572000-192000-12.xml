		<title>12 A day in the life of.....</title>
		<content> We would usually spend a leisure day  
 either going to a neighbouring town eg
 Romford,Southend or Basildon looking  
 around the markets and shops and then 
 finishing up in Macdonalds.If we go to
 Southend during the summer we would   
 spend most of our time along the      
 seafront,either swimming or sunbathing
 or going in the amusements or the     
 fair.Sometimes of a Wednsday evening  
 you could find us in one of Basildons 
 discos called Racquels.This is a night
 specially set aside for the 14-18 year
 olds.Sometimes of a Saturday night we 
 go to a disco that is being held up at
 the Wickford Community centre or if a 
 mate has a party we would go there.If 
 there are no parties or discos on a   
 Saturday or any other night we would  
 either walk around the town having a  
 laugh or going in the community centre
 where you can play pool,darts or cards</content>
