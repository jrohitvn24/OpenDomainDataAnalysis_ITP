		<title>01UPPER BEXHILL AND SIDLEY</title>
		<content>    This undulating area lies just in- 
 land from the{Sussex coast}and can be 
 cut diagonally in half from N.W. to   
 S.E. following the A269/A2036.        
    South of the line the block is     
 mainly residential, comprising the    
 outskirts of the{resort}and{retirement
 town of{Bexhill.}North of this the    
 block is mainly farm and woodland.    
   {Sidley,}once a village but now a   
 suburb of Bexhill, has it's own       
 shopping centre and lies in the middle
 of the block. The main road south into
 the resort from Sidley passes to it's 
 east{Bexhill Old Town,}which has an   
 ancient church and weather-boarded    
 houses.                               
    The A259 coast road from Eastbourne
 to Hastings follows the southern      
 boundary of the area. A new by-pass   
 avoids the Old Town, the modern centre
 now lying south towards the seafront. </content>
