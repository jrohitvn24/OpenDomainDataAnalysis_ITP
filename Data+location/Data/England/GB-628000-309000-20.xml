 My name is Susan and I asked my mother
 what she thought about living in      
 Thorpe End. There are not many shops  
 in the area so my mum goes by car to a
{supermarket}near Norwich.There is only
 a green for children to play on, so my
 mum thinks there should be more       
{leisure facilities.}Behind our house  
 is a building site where more         
 modernized houses are being built. I  
 asked my mum what she thought about   
 them and she said, "They are making a 
 good job of them,but I prefer the old 
 thatched houses".Out of the three     
 shops in Thorpe End, which are the    
 Post Office,Salon and Garage, my mum  
 uses the garage the most for petrol.My
 mum likes living where she does       
 because it is{peaceful,}yet  within   
 easy reach of the city of Norwich.    </content>
