 I saw many willow trees, they droop   
 down nearly to the ground, and two    
 types of ivy. They climb up the trees,
 winding around the trunk. A hawthorn  
 tree with its spiky prickles and an   
 alder tree after which Allerford -    
 originally Alderford - was named.     
                                       
{Flowers.}                             
 Rosebay willowherbs are tall flowers  
 with pink petals. Dandelions were     
 seeding. Clover was growing in amongst
 the grass where celandines were just  
 poking through with their yellow      
 flowers. Blackberries were just       
 ripening in the hedgerows,amongst     
 teasels with their prickly pods.      
 Greater Burdock with its sticky pods  
 stuck to our legs while the nettles   
 stung. Rowan with its poisonous       
 berries stood out brightly.           </content>
