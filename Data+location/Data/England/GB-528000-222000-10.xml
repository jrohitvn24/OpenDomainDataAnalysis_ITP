		<title>10BENINGTON SCHOOL (1)</title>
		<content>Education in Benington is first record-
ed in the Will Of Henry Dixon dated    
1651 in which provision was made for   
placing poor boys into apprenticeships 
to handicraft trades.                  
We next hear of a Sunday School being  
held in the Chancel of the Church and a
"Dame School or two" being held in the 
cottages. In 1836 moves were made for  
the establishment of a permanent school
in Benington and it was stated that the
school would receive "40 little boys   
and 50 girls in one room."The Fees were
to be one penny per week.The total cost
of the building was 158 pounds. The    
school was completed in 1843.          
In 1873 a new Nation School replaced   
the former building on a new site. This
was for the instruction of the labour- 
ing poor who lived within one mile of  
the village. (Cont.)
