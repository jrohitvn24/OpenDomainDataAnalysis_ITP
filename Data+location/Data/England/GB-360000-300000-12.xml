		<content>{VIDEOS}More children watch videos than
 read books or visit cinemas. Half our 
 sample have a V.C.R. at home and half 
 of them list one or more "video nasty"
 as favourite viewing- usually films   
 depicting excessive violence or super-
 natural horrors.                      
{TELEVISION:}The most popular leisure  
 activity. All the sample have a T.V.  
 at home and half have a video and/or  
 computer. Many children watch T.V. in 
 moderation but some watch for several 
 hours daily, including late evening   
 programmes. Soap operas are most      
 widely watched (Grange Hill,          
 Eastenders,Crossroads, Emmerdale Farm)
 then comedies both children's and     
 adult (Adrian Mole, Cartoons, Open All
 Hours, Crry On films, Sorry). Next in 
 popularity are American               
 action/adventure/ police series eg. A 
 Team,Street Hawk, Dempsey &amp; Makepeace.</content>
