		<title>17RECREATION, TEAM GAME</title>
		<content> The games we play in 1985 vary a lot. 
 The sporty type games like tennis,    
 rounders and netball are a lot        
 different to board games and card     
 games we play at home. Rounders is a  
 game we enjoy playing in school. There
 are nine players in each team. Each   
 has a position. There are two teams - 
 one fielding, one batting. The batters
 have to hit the ball that the bowler  
 has thrown and run round the bases to 
 fourth to score a rounder for their   
 team, which is the object of the game.
 The fielders have to try to stop them.
 THe bases are arranged in a           
 semi-circle. Two basic rules of the   
 game are that you are not allowed to  
 cut across the playing area, but you  
 have to run round not necessarily     
 stopping at each. If you hit the ball 
 behind, you can only run to first     
 base.                                 </content>
