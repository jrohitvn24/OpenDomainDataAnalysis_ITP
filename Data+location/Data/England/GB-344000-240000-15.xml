		<content> There is no large employer in the     
 block but several employers provide   
 work for smaller numbers. Local farms 
 employ some workers but since the     
 spread of mechanisation in recent     
 years, both in stock- and             
 land-management, farming is not so    
 labour-intensive as previously. Some  
 workers are employed at the gravel pit
 and the refuse tip at Stretton Sugwas;
 some are engaged in fruit farming;    
 some work at Wyevale Garden Centre and
 its nurseries, which also accept      
 horticultural students for practical  
 training. There are jobs too with a   
 small building firm started in 1938 by
 the present owner's father and uncle, 
 which does general building work.     
 Local service industries also provide 
 some jobs, i.e. public houses, filling
 station, shop.                        
                                       </content>
