		<content>   This 17th century brick-built house 
 has long been the centre of life in   
 Highnam.Earlier buildings belonged to 
 Gloucester Abbey,the country residence
 of the abbots.After the Dissolution it
 passed through the families of the    
 Arnolds,Lucys and the Cookes who built
 the present house in the later years  
 of the Commonwealth.In 1838 it was    
 bought from the Guise family by Thomas
 Gambier-Parry from Surrey.A man of    
 many parts,he used his wealth         
 improving his house,gardens and estate
 and built a church and school for the 
 village.                              
   The house today is a centre for the 
 arts,particularly music,with frequent 
 workshops and concerts.It was the     
 early home of{COURTYARD ARTS TRUST},  
 now known as  Gloucester Arts.
