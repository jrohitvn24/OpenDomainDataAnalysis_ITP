		<title>18The Parish of St. Clement</title>
		<content>   Most of the land we covered in our  
 Domesday survey was in the parish of  
 St Clement. The Parish of St Clement  
 is the smallest of the twelve parishes
 in Jersey and it is also one of the   
 most fertile. The area of the Parish  
 of St Clement is only 1044 acres. It  
 extends from Le Dicq to La Rocque     
 pier. The parish of St Clement is     
 divided into three separate Vingtaines
 (subdivisions of the parish) Samares, 
 Rocquier and the Grande Vingtaine. The
 largest of the Vingtaines is Samares. 
 The parish  St. Clement is named after
 Clement 1, the Bishop of Rome in A.D. 
 92. The legend of St. Clement is that 
 he was thrown into the Black Sea with 
 his neck chained to an anchor. That is
 why the emblem of the parish of St.   
 Clement is an anchor.
