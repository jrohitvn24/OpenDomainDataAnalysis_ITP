		<content> Homelife in 1985 is quite comfortable.
 The homes in general are quite modern 
 and many tenants are making           
 improvements to their property.Lots of
 people have central heating and many  
 are putting in double glazing to keep 
 themselves warmer in winter.Most      
 houses have radio,TV,and a record or  
 cassette player,and more people are   
 buying video players as well.In the   
 kitchen there is likely to be a       
 washing machine and a spin drier.Some 
 families have dish washers.           
 Most homes have a garden back and     
 front where the grow vegetables and   
 flowers.                              
 Private houses usually have a garage, 
 but those people living on council    
 estates usually have to park on the   
 road.More garages are being built     
 where there is space next to the      
 house.                                </content>
