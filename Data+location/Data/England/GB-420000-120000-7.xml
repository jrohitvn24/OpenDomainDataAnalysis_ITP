		<content> People who used to come our school    
 have told us about the history of our 
 school and what their schooldays were 
 like.                                 
      The first school was a thatched  
 building dating from 1838.It was      
 replaced in 1878 .This changed over   
 the years and in 1965 the school was  
 enlarged to three classrooms.In 1970  
 the field behind the school was bought
 to make a large playing field.        
     A villager who started in 1915    
 remembers that the headmaster was the 
 village scribe.The boys at that time  
 wore Norfolk suits and Eton collars   
 with bow ties.The girls wore black    
 stockings and boots.They wore         
 pinafores over their thick frocks.    
    The lessons were arithmetic,       
 reading,history,geography,writng      
 drawing and religious instruction.
