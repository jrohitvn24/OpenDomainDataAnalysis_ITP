 below 8m a.s.l.,and used to be marshy 
 "Carr lands". The heavy boulder clay  
{soil}has been drained by many ditches 
 which feed the{HOLDERNESS DRAIN.}This 
 contains Roach,Perch,Pike,Bream,Tench 
 and eels, but in June 1985 it was     
{polluted}by pig slurry and many fish  
 died.                                 
   There is only one small wood, at    
 Ganstead, which contains a rookery. 70
 species of bird were recorded,        
 including Kingfisher,Little Owl and   
 Sparrowhawk, but hedgerows are being  
 removed.
