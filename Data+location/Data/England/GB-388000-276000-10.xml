		<title>10Blakedown Parish Council</title>
		<content> Blakedown Parish Council consists of  
 various elected members of the        
 community. It is responsible for such 
 domestic details as the street        
 lighting of the minor roads. The      
 County Council has responsibility for 
 the major roads. The Parish Council   
 doesn't have much final power, but if 
 any person wishes to change the size  
 of a building, they need planning     
 permission from the Rural District    
 Council. However, for large buildings,
 the Parish Council must be contacted  
 and allowed to state their views.     
 One member represents the Council on  
 the Board of Governors of Blakedown   
 School.                               
 Members are also elected from the     
 village to serve on the County Council
 which has greater control over        
 Herefordshire and Worcestershire.
