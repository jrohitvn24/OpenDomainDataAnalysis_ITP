		<content>Catherine and Paul visited Miss Evans  
who lives in the Almshouses in Penn.   
Miss Evans was born in Penn on 12th.   
June 1902. She was one of eight        
children. Miss Evans was in service in 
a private school and then at a large   
house in Penn until she was 68.        
She has attended St. Barts. church     
since she was a very youmg child and   
all her family used to go to church    
together. She still goes to the early  
morning communion every Sunday.        
Miss Evans goes for a walk most days   
and enjoys listening to the radio and  
reading.  She does not watch very much 
television except for Songs of Praise  
on Sunday evenings and the news.       
She will be quite happy to stay in the 
Almshouses until she is unable to look 
after herself.
