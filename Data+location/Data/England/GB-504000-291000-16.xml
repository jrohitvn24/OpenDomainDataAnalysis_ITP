Children  commence  school, very  often
part-time,  at  the  beginning  of  the
school year in which they become  five.
In this area the  schools are in  three
tiers.                                 
The  First School  takes children up to
nine  years  of  age.     Most  of  the
children  transfer at  this age  to the
Oundle Middle School.                  
There are  Middle Schools  for children
in  the   Kings  Cliffe  and  Thrapston
catchment areas also.                  
They remain at the  Middle Schools  for
four years.                            
Most  then   transfer   to  the  Prince
William  School.    This  is  an  upper
school  with  children  from  13 to  18
years of  age mainly  from the  Oundle,
Kings Cliffe and Thrapston areas.
