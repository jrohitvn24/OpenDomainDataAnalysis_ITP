		<title>04THE CHURCH IN CUCKFIELD</title>
		<content>  Cuckfield Church, built 1245,  is one
 of the most interesting historical    
 buildings in the village. The first   
 vicar, Walter De Warnecamp, was       
 appointed in 1252 and the present     
 vicar, Eric Hayden was appointed in   
 1978. Inside the church are many      
 monuments to famous and rich Cuckfield
 people of the past. There are 13      
 monuments to members of the Burrell   
 family (Iron Industry 16th to 18th    
 Centuries),&amp; monuments to the Sergison
 family (owners until recently of      
 Cuckfield Park). Also in the church is
 the earliest remaining record of      
 births, marriages and deaths, 1598.   
  1981 church spire destroyed by fire. 
 The people of Cuckfield rallied       
 together and a new spire has now been 
 built. The church continues to be a   
 focal point in the village and to play
 and important part in community life. </content>
