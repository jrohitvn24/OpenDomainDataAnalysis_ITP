		<content> There are 304 adults and 83 children ,
 16 under 5.In the outlying farms and  
 cottages are25 adults and 11 children.
 Nosterfield has 17 retired out of 87  
 adults-20% and Well has 48 out of 192 
 -25%,27 are long term residents and 21
 have come in the last 5 years.2 had   
 the chance of a council bungalow,     
 another an almshouse and 3 came to be 
 near younger relatives.Surprisingly   
 there are as many retired men as women
 and as many over 80 men as women.     
 Many families are old established,    
 their names recurring in early church 
 records and on old maps; other        
 families, obviously influential at one
 time, are not represented.            
 There is a most satisfactory socio-   
 economic mix. No-one is poor and there
 are trusts for help in times of need. 
 No-one is obviously rich - wealth is  
 probably invested in land.            </content>
