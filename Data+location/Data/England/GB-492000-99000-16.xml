		<title>16Housing in Bognor (general)</title>
		<content>  Bognor grew under the influence of   
 Sir Richard Hotham during the 18th    
 Century.                              
  In the 1920's there was a 'new town' 
 scheme when many buildings were       
 erected in 1922 a new residential     
 area The Steyne was built with the    
 houses having bow fronts and          
 verandahs.                            
  In the late 19th and early 20th      
 Centuries the town's modest expansion 
 consisted of convalescent homes, two  
 theatres and residential acommodation.
 Most of the houses directly           
 surrounding the town were built       
 between the wars.                     
  The town has continued to grow and   
 has thus engulfed surrounding         
 villages. This causes older houses to 
 appear amidst new developments.       
  Housing development continues.
