		<title>15POLICING   OF  THE MOORLANDS</title>
		<content> ANIMALS-There are several problems for
 the police with animals on he moors.  
 Firstly there is the problem of sheep 
 worrying. This is particularly        
 dangerous during lambing. The dogs can
 either be strays or dogs let off the  
 lead by their owners. Landowners are  
 entitled to shoot the dogs and the    
 police have to make sure that they    
 take all necessary precaution.        
      Sheep stealing or rustling is a  
 problem for on the moors the sheep    
 graze over a very wide area           
 particularly in the summer months.    
       There are occasions when there  
 is an outbreak of a very infectious   
 animal disease such as foot and mouth.
 The Ministry of Agriculture then      
 imposes a restriction of movement of  
 all animals within a certain area. It 
 is up to the police to enforce these  
 regulations.                          </content>
