		<title>09Retired to N.Luffenham</title>
		<content> A married couple retired to N.L.from  
 Kent.They came to this area to be     
 near relatives who had wartime        
 associations with R.A.F. N.L. They    
 also find the area attractive.The     
 wife is settled but her husband wants 
 to return South where there are more  
 activities.Both find the continuous   
 change of neighbours (many of whom are
 R.A.F.personnel) unsettling.Along with
 this they feel that as they age and   
 can no longer drive,they will be      
 isolated in the village.The bus       
 service is very limited and travel by 
 taxi is expensive. Village activities 
 for the retired are :_"Evergreens",   
 allotments (for the gardener),"Chater 
 Bowls Club"and the village cricket    
 team.Much of the wife's leisure time  
 is spent in voluntary work in         
 Stamford.They wish to leave N.L.and   
 move nearer their daughter or son.    </content>
