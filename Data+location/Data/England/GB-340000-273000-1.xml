		<title>01Leintwardine and District 1.</title>
		<content> The area is mostly given over to farm 
 land and contains the villages of     
{Leintwardine}(pop. 750)and            
 Downton.The{River Clun}meets the{River
{Teme}just before it gets into         
 Leintwardine. There is a church in    
 Downton called St Giles, and one in   
 Leintwardine called St.Mary Magdalene.
  The name Leintwardine is of Saxon    
 origin - Lenta's wardine i.e Lenta's  
 enclosure. The village is of interest 
 to archaeologists in that the site is 
 identical with that of the Roman      
 Bravonium.                            
  There isn't a railway line going     
 through the area. The A4113 passes    
 from S.W.to N.E.                      
  The rocks in the area are full of    
 fossils;remains of sea creatures.     
 Sir Roderick Murchison gave the name  
 Monograptus Leintwardinensis to a     
 fossil found on top of Church Hill.   </content>
