		<content> Although none are actually stationed  
 within the area boundaries,the loca-  
 tion of the R.E.M.E.at Bordon and the 
 Army Cadet Headquarters at Longmoor   
 affects the area by the occupation of 
 land in the extreme SW as firing      
 ranges. This restricts use of public  
 footpaths at firing times and excludes
 all entry by the public during        
 exercises.                            
  A useful service to the community is 
 provided by a family concern operating
 taxis and mini-buses for local and    
 long distance journeys. The business  
 grew out of a taxi service established
 about 40 years ago;in its present form
 the firm also supplies airline and    
 theatre tickets and a personal courier
 service. It is contracted to the      
 County for the provision of school    
 buses. A car is regarded as a         
 necessity.                            </content>
