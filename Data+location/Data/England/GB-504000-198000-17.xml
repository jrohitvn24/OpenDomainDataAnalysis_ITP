		<title>17LANGLEYBURY COMP'VE SCHOOL</title>
		<content> In July 1985 a senior teacher, Mrs    
 Weller, retired from the school having
 begun her career when the school      
 opened after the last war. In an      
 interview with pupils she spoke about 
 her career at the school. When it     
 opened all children were taught in the
 Mansion. There were 11 teachers and   
 classes were small. Today there are   
 over 50 staff and classes in the lower
 years average 25. The children thought
 the Mansion felt spooky in the early  
 days, and it was heated by open fires.
 Mrs Weller had only given 2 detentions
 - she preferred to sort problems out  
 for herself! She recounted various    
 stories and is now, in her retirement,
 looking back over 21 years of teaching
 English at Langleybury.               
   In 1985 the Leggatts School closed  
 and the site became an annexe of      
 Langleybury School.                   </content>
