		<title>15The Army and the Moor</title>
		<content>    The armed forces have used the moor
 for a considerable time as a gunnery  
 range. Luckily this does not preclude 
 walkers from using the moor for       
 recreation.                           
    If firing is taking place then     
 flags will be flown from some of the  
 tors. In this particular case there is
 a flagpole of Doe Tor, and another on 
 Hare Tor. When these flags are flying,
 do not enter. If firing is taking     
 place at night then lights are flown  
 from the flagpoles.                   
    The limit of the firing range is   
 shown by posts painted white and red. 
 When the flags are flying, the walker 
 may not enter. Also on the moor are   
 several Range Notice Boards. These    
 give information regarding the limit  
 of the range.                         
    Finally there are telephone numbers
 that can be consulted regarding firing</content>
