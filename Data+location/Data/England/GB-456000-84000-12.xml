 shows where a member of royalty is    
 going and where to send a plane if    
 necessary.  The 1980's could mark a   
 drastic change at Sandown airport.    
 Some people think that they should    
 expand the airport so that large      
 passenger planes carrying tourists can
 land there.  Others are against this  
 plan because the airport is right next
 to a school and a new housing estate. 
 They think that the planes going      
 overhead could be very noisy and they 
 could cause a very bad accident.  No  
 one really knows what will happen to  
 the airport.  If they do expand it, it
 could turn into an airport like       
 Heathrow.
