		<content> Our survey covers part of the North   
 Notts. area known as Bassetlaw. Most  
 of the survey area is agricultural    
 land. The soils are light and sandy,  
 being part of what was Sherwood       
 Forest. The farming carried out is    
 mainly arable with wheat, barley,     
 sugarbeet, potatoes and peas being the
 main crops. Some dairy cattle are also
 kept to provide milk in some areas.   
 The A1/M is a major feature of our    
 survey area. It is one of the main    
 north/south routes in the country     
 linking London and the South/East to  
 Scotland.                             
 Blyth with a population of 1300       
 approximately is the only village in  
 the survey area. Blyth is a sleepy    
 dormitory for the surrounding         
 industrial towns of Sheffield,        
 Doncaster, Rotherham, Worksop,        
 Nottingham and Retford.               </content>
