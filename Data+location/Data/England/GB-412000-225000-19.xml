		<title>19Mrs Bandeira</title>
		<content> Mrs Bandeira was born at Guiting Power
 87 years ago and married a Portuguese 
 who came to England to cut pit-props  
 during the 1914-18 war. He became     
 manager of the slate quarries at      
 Eyeford. Mrs Bandeira can recall the  
 names and sizes of all the Cotswold   
 slates.                               
 The rent of her cottage at Chalk Hill 
 was originally one shilling and       
 sixpence (7.5 pence). Her home now    
 consists of two houses combined into  
 one. There is still no bathroom or    
 W.C. A bath is taken in a tin bath in 
 front of the old black iron grate     
 where the kettles hang to boil.       
 Clothes are washed by hand. Mrs       
 Bandeira does have a T.V. set, and is 
 hoping to have a telephone installed. 
 She enjoys talking about the old days 
 when she helped on the farms, often   
 riding the farm horses at their work. </content>
