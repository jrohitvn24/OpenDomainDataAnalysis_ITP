		<title>17Westcliff Estate.</title>
		<content> (A view by Riddings Junior School.)   
 On Westcliff Estate, we saw lots      
 of different houses with considerable 
 contrasts between them. Here are      
 some of the types of houses we saw:-  
 detatched, dormer houses , bungalows, 
 flats and a type of terraced house.   
 Some of the contrasts between the     
 houses that we saw, were very         
 different, for example, at one end of 
 Whitman Road, it was very peaceful,   
 whilst at the other end more children 
 were playing. On one road on the      
 estate there was a mixture of         
 detatched, semi-detatched and dormer  
 houses, all of which were built       
 between nineteen and twenty-one years 
 ago.                                  
 All of these houses had garages and   
 both front and back gardens with well 
 kept lawns and flower beds.
