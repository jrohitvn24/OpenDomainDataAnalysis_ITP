{  _______________________             
  The club has a playing membership  of
 some 20 members plus associate members
 which includes older past players.    
  The   team  competes  in  the  Newark
 and District   Evening   League, which
 includes teams  within a fifteen  mile
 radius of Newark.                     
  At the weekends, matches are arranged
 between local villages, this  helps to
 promote community spirit. Families and
 villagers  turn  out  to  watch  these
 games.  Whilst  the  parents watch the
 cricket the children enjoy  themselves
 on the swings and slides.             
  At the  end of the playing season the
 club  holds  a  presentation  evening.
 Awards are  presented  to  outstanding
 players  and the  evening is usually a
 successful social event, this  being a
 fitting end to a season's sport.      </content>
