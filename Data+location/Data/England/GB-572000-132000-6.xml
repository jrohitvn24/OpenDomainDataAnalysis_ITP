		<content>   The Church Education Corporation,   
 the School's governing body, was      
 established in 1900 to promote        
 independent education for girls in a  
 Christian setting and has owned       
 Bedgebury since 1920.                 
   There are about 400 pupils, mostly  
 boarding but some day girls, of whom  
 half (ages 14 to 18) are in the Upper 
 School at Bedgebury Park and half (8  
 to 13) in Lower School at Lillesden in
 Hawkhurst, about 10 kilometres away.  
   Up to the Fifth Year there is a core
 curriculum of English, maths, history,
 French and biology, with religious and
 physical education and options in the 
 humanities, sciences and domestic and 
 aesthetic subjects.  6th Form studies 
 include advanced and vocational work. 
   There are also sports, cultural and 
 charitable activities, many in compet-
 ition/cooperation with other schools. </content>
