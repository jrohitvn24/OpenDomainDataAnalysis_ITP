		<content> The Homewatch Community Security      
 Scheme was instigated by the Parish   
 Council in Adlington in Feb. 1985.    
 This voluntary self-help scheme       
 involves the local community &amp; the    
 police co-operating together with a   
 common aim, that of reducing crime    
 particularly burglary in Adlington.   
 The village is divided into groups    
 with about ten households per group.  
 In each group one selected            
 representative acts as co-ordinator.  
 The main functions are the observation
 of suspicious persons or vehicles in  
 the neighbourhood, watching           
 neighbour's homes when unoccupied &amp;   
 reporting anything suspicious to the  
 co-ordinator who in turn notifies the 
 police. Records show that in areas    
 where "Homewatch" is in operation the 
 crime rate is substantially reduced.
