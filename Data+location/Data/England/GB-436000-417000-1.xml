		<title>01Sharlston and Crofton</title>
		<content>  Sharlston and Crofton are villages on
 the outskirts of Wakefield. Both are  
 close to the main roads to Doncaster  
 and Pontefract and are largely        
 residential, with most people         
 travelling out of the area to work and
 shop. Housing is a mixture of         
 council-owned and private, with some  
 modern, some terraced and some very   
 old buildings such as Sharlston Hall. 
 Although surrounded by farmland the   
 main employer is probably the N.C.B.  
 Each village has coal mines nearby and
 this often means houses suffer from   
 subsidence. Entertainment is provided 
 by pubs and clubs. There is also a    
 strong sporting tradition,            
 particularly with regard to Rugby     
 League.
