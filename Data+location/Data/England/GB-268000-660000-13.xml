		<title>13The Viewpark Glen</title>
		<content>      The 'Glen' is what is left of    
large estates which belonged to two    
mansion houses which are demolished.   
The Red Burn and North Calder Water    
run through the land which has many    
plantations of different kinds of      
trees. There are many species of       
wild plants and some wildlife.         
Years ago people went down the Glen    
for outings and picnics.               
      A lot of dumping and vandalism   
made the Glen a poor place for a wh-   
ile. Now there are workers cleaning    
up the land and making things look     
better. Money is being spent to make   
paths and safer bridges. At the top    
end near the main road is a new in-    
terpretive centre for visitors. A      
full time ranger helps keep vandals    
out and gives people information. He   
has junior rangers to help him. Ben,   
in our class, is one of them.          </content>
