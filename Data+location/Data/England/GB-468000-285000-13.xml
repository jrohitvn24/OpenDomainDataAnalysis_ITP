		<title>13A FARM IN MARSTON TRUSSELL</title>
		<content>  All 600 acres of{Strattford Farm}is  
 owned by a college in Oxford. Mrs.    
 Mackintosh, who has worked there for 6
 years tells us that the farm is to be 
 sold for two million pounds. The farm 
 workers live in tied houses and       
 because of this they are worried about
 their future.                         
  The farmer starts work at 5.00am and 
 works until dusk. Half the farm is    
 used for growing{cereals}and the      
 remainder is for grazing{beef}and     
{dairy}cattle.Haymaking and calving are
 the busiest times of the year.        
  The{farmhouse}was built in 1743 and  
 has lots of tunnels coming through    
 from the church.In one of the bedrooms
 there is a priest hole 6 feet under   
 the floorboards.                      
  Mr.Mackintosh is in the egg trade,he 
 buys deep litter eggs and sells them  
 on.                                   </content>
