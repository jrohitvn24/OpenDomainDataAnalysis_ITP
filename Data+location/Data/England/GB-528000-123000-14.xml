		<title>14ROAD TRAFFIC IN CUCKFIELD</title>
		<content>  Cuckfield's busiest road is Broad    
 Street, the A272 to Haywards Heath. In
 1 hour approx. 370 cars and 60 lorries
 travel in any one direction along this
 road, one of the few east/west routes 
 in Sussex.                            
  People complain a lot about lorries. 
 We had one report of a shop window    
 near a narrow bend cracked by the     
 vibrations caused by a lorry.         
  The roads are busy during the        
 school's rush hours (8.20-8.55am and  
 3.00-3.45pm), when a lollipop lady    
 helps children across the road. It is 
 also busy after 5pm when people return
 from their work.                      
  A bypass is very much needed but as  
 yet no route has been agreed upon.    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
