		<title>14The Shops in Oxted.</title>
		<content>{Station Road East}is the main shopping
 street, it is built on a hill. Most   
 people shop there. Some shops are in  
{Station Road West.}You can buy nearly 
 all you need in Oxted. There are three
 supermarkets,{Sainsbury's, Fine Fare  
 and{Budgens. Woolworth}is quite big,  
 but it doesn't have a wide variety of 
 clothes and toys. It is very good for 
 plants and gardening things.{Boots the
{Chemist}sells toiletries, photographs 
 and medicines. A prescription costs   
 Â£2.{White's Bazaar}is a lovely toy    
 shop. You can buy games, toys, pencils
 and little plastic dolls. Just the    
 place to spend pocket money.{Oxted    
{Gallery}is probably the strangest     
 shop. It sells mugs, soaps, cushions  
 and baskets all crowded together, a   
 good place to chose a present. If you 
 look up, the flats above the shops    
 have interesting designs. by S. Pugh  </content>
