   The fields near to te river are very
 large and rectangular. These fields   
 are fairly recent as they have been   
 reclaimed from land which was flooded 
 by the river. The river is now bounded
 by high banks to prevent flooding. It 
 has been straightened and isconstantly
 being dredged to help navigation and  
 to prevent flooding.                  
   The chief crops of the area are     
 cereals, sugar beet, rape,            
 cauliflowers, broccolli and cabbage.  
 Near Frampton fruit especially        
 blackcurrants, raspberries and plums  
 are grown.
