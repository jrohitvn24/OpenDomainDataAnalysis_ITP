		<title>04Sunday in N.Wingfield</title>
		<content> On Sundays my family stays in bed late
 except for my mother.She gets up      
 earlier and puts the meat in the oven 
 for the Sunday dinner.We don't always 
 have breakfast but if we do,cereal or 
 toast is enough.About this time,my    
 sister's boyfriend comes to the       
 house.My sister always asks how long  
 dinner will be and my mum says        
 something like"two foot six".I usually
 help my mum with the washing and      
 ironing and she also hoovers up and   
 polishes.At 2.30 my dad comes home    
 from work and we have dinner.Sometimes
 we have home made wine with our       
 dinner.After a big dinner we do some  
 gardening,sunbathe or go to a friend's
 house.At night we watch T.V.and go to 
 bed.  Lisa Godfrey aged 11
