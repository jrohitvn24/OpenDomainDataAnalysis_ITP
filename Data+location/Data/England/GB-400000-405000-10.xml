		<title>10HOUSING IN SADDLEWORTH</title>
		<content> Most of the housing in the area today 
 is owner-occupied. Many of the older  
 properties have been extensively      
 modernised. There are council houses  
 dating from before the 1st World War  
 in Diggle, &amp; early photographs of the 
 area show how the valley has become   
 progressively populated since that    
 time. There were large tips then, of  
 spoil from the railway tunnels        
 constructed at Standedge, but this was
 later landscaped to allow for more    
 buildings. There are modern detached  
 and semi- detached properties at      
 Diggle and Uppermill, and on steeply- 
 sloping sites they are usually split- 
 level. Modern properties are usually  
 made of brick or reconstituted stone, 
 &amp; the local quarries are now closed as
 there is little demand for stone now. 
 The area is zoned for housing, primary
 employment &amp; green belt/recreational. </content>
