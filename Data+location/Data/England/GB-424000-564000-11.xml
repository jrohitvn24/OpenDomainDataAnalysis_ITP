		<title>11Newcastle Town Moor</title>
		<content>    The{Newcastle Town Moor}is an      
 invaluable city amenity. It is used   
 all year round for cross country      
 running, cattle grazing and hobbies   
 like model aeroplane flying. A major  
 use is for the{Hoppings,}the largest  
 travelling fair in Europe, which comes
 to the Moor for a week in June. The   
 Moor is very close to the city centre 
 and is easily accessible.             
    The city council has avoided the   
 temptation to build on the Moor,      
 although the NW section of the{urban  
{motorway}cuts across the SW corner.   
 The earth excavated for the motorway  
 was used to make two mounds.  These   
 hills are ideal for running, and are  
 used for sledging and{skiing}in       
 winter.                               
    Sadly, with rising{violence,}its   
 loneliness means muggings are on the  
 increase.                             </content>
