		<title>12BEACON  HILL</title>
		<content> Beacon Hill is so named because it was
 used to light Beacons.They lit them   
 because it was the highest point in   
 the area.It may have been used to warn
 people in the surrounding country that
 ships were attacking at Seaton.Beacon 
 Hill is now used for farming,and      
 grazing cattle.The surrounding area is
 called Birchill and is partly covered 
 in shrubs and is marshy.Beacon Hill is
 just outside the village of           
 Chardstock.
