		<content> Papworth School has been designated a 
 Community School and plays a major    
 role in the community. There are about
 60 children on roll. The school is of 
 an older design but does have its own 
 swimming pool. Meals for the children 
 are brought in containers from another
 school's kitchen. The school is       
 basically organised into 2 classes.   
                                       
 The school's catchment area is the    
 Village Settlement and Hospital and   
 this places it in a unique position.  
 Children at age 11 move on to Swavesey
 Village College, and if they choose to
 continue education beyond 16 travel to
 Cambridge.
