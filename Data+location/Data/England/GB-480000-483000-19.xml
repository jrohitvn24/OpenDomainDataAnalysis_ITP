 Thornton since 1661.In the 17th and   
 18th Century they were lords of       
 Sinnington, Normanby and Thornton.In  
 1925 they sold their land to the      
 Forestry Commission.                  
 In the 17th Century the population of 
 Thornton was only about 1300 but today
 has risen to 2000.Her grandfather     
 built the Memorial Hall and gave it to
 the post office.                      
 Under her dining-room was once a tiny 
 prison,known as the "Black Hole".Mrs  
 Morgan,who is very fond of the area,  
 is the patron of Thornton Dale and    
 Ellerburn and she appointed the new   
 vicar,Reverend Clements. She still    
 owns 7 farms,all the woodland around  
 Thornton except Dalby(this was sold in
 1925),Pexton, 5 cottages. Her estate  
 totals about 2000 acres.              </content>
