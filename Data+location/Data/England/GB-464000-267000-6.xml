		<title>06CUSTOMS IN EAST HADDON</title>
		<content>The last two years have seen the       
revival of a May Fayre by the school.  
The afternoon begins with a procession 
through the village by the children led
by the May Queen. She is crowned on the
steps of the school by the retiring    
queen. The afternoon is then followed  
by singing,sports,and maypole dancing. 
This custom had previously died out at 
about the time of the Second World War.
