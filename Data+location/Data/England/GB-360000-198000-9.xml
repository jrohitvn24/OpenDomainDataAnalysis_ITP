		<title>09TRANSPORT IN ALVINGTON</title>
		<content> The only service bus for Alvington    
 runs from Gloucester to Cardiff.  Most
 households have cars to solve their   
 transport and commuting problems.     
 There are two garages, one selling    
 petrol and the other doing repairs.   
 The Gloucester to Cardiff railway line
 runs through the area but there is no 
 station.                              
 There is very little employment within
 the village.  There is no industry, or
 tourism, three houses offer Bed and   
 Breakfast accomodation and Bar snacks 
 are available at the two Public       
 houses.  The three farms are family   
 owned and managed.
