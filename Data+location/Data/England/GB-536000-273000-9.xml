		<title>09CHANGES IN EARITH</title>
		<content> Over the last{60 years}there have been
 many{changes.}Before{sanitation,}     
 sewage was collected by cart,and      
 before that, people dug a hole in the 
 yard. There used to be a{tan yard}for 
 horses, owned by{The Guest House,}    
 which is now called{The Riverview Inn.
 Today there are only{2 pubs}but there 
 used to be about{9.}There were also 2{
{blacksmiths,}a{wheel wright,}a{milking
{parlour}and a{jam factory}in Earith.  
 The{River Ouse}was used more for      
 businesses, where as today it is      
 used for leisure.                     
 The Seven Hole Bridge over the river  
 has only 3 holes now! There used to be
 a railway station, but it no longer   
 exists.
