		<title>13RUDDINGTON PANTOMIME</title>
		<content> Every year a {Pantomime }is performed 
 in February on the stage in the Junior
 School for 4 nights.                  
 It all started when{Lorna McCullough }
 was asked to do monologues at the     
 Harvest supper.The next year she was  
 asked again and on the third year she 
 thought every-one would be getting fed
 up so she got a group together to do a
 sketch. They did a little humorous    
 play based on the Archers from the    
 radio.Mr.Jack suggested that they     
 ought to continue the group and       
 entertain the village every year.     
 The first pantomime was {Robin Hood } 
 in 1981 and since then {Lorna         
{McCullogh}has written  one every year 
 and they have got more spectacular and
 a great success.This years was {      
{Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.}They     
 give the profits to local charities   
 and good causes.                      </content>
