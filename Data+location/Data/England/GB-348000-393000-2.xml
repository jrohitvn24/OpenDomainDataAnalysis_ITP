 households,of which 55 replied.       
 10% of all households were one parent 
 families, while most families         
 consisted of 2 adults and 2 children. 
 66% of all fathers were employed and  
 33% of all mothers.Many mothers       
 thought being a housewife was         
 important.Most teenagers under 18 were
 still at school though some 20% were  
 unemployed.                           
   People enjoy watching television    
 most,though visiting friends and      
 walking were also popular.In our      
 sample Bingo was the least popular    
 leisure time activity.The most popular
 sports played were rugby and soccer,  
 with tennis and running well supported

 and washing machines,and many had     
 portable tv's as well.Half the sample
