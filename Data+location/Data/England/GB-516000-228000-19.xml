		<title>19HITCHIN RACIAL MINORITIES</title>
		<content>   Taking a stroll about Hitchin you   
 see people with different shades of   
 hair, eyes and skin. Indians' skins   
 are lighter,West Indians' darker. West
 Indians wear hats, Indians turbans,   
 with very colourful clothes and gold  
 and silver jewellery, mainly bangles  
 and ear-rings. Their eyes are mostly  
 brown. Unusual accents from immigrant 
 communities may be hard to understand.
   There are shops selling callaloo,   
 ackee, salt fish, yams, sweet potatoes
 for West Indians and bissan, chapatis,
 ludu, chillis for Indians.            
   Immigrants from the Caribbean and   
 India still visit relatives in the    
 country they emigrated from.          
   On Sundays Indians worship at       
 temples in Bearton Ave., and Radcliffe
 Rd. and West Indians at the New       
 Testament Church of God, Bunyan Rd.
