		<title>12FARMING (TWO)</title>
		<content> The land borders the south Shropshire 
 Clee hills. In the west it reaches    
 350m, falling, sometimes very steeply,
 to 160m in Farlow village. The farms  
 are mostly family farms, the majority 
 of which are defined by the Ministry  
 of Agriculture as "less favoured".    
 These farms support more than one     
 household within the the family but   
 employ little regular outside labour. 
    Some farmers earn additional income
 by contracting services and machinery.
 Most farming is mixed, i.e. cattle and
 sheep with some arable. There are a   
 few dairy herds. One farm specialises 
 in arable crops. The six smaller farms
 are also farmed intensively but do not
 as a rule provide the only source of  
 income to the farmer. A few houses in 
 the area have a small amount of land  
 but are not seriously involved in     
 agriculture.                          </content>
