		<content> My father used to be a pig farmer     
 based at Goosemoor Farm. Now another  
 pig farmer rents the land from him.   
 Last September he started a business  
 growing shrubs in one acre of land.   
 The very young plants which come to us
 from a factory are brought on in pots 
 of peat and compost. They are kept    
 in two poly tunnels, each holding     
 13,500 plants. After about 3 years the
 young shrubs are sent to the          
 nurseries for sale to the public.     
 Sweetcorn and strawberries are also   
 grown and the public can come and pick
 their own.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
