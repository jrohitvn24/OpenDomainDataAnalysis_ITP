		<content>Since the Jubilee celebrations a very  
thriving Community Association has     
developed, meetings of different types 
are held, social events such as        
skittles evenings,barn dances and      
Village fete. A two or three monthly   
newsletter is delivered to every house 
in Little Aston to keep residents in   
touch with local happenings.           
Little Aston is twinned with St Georges
sur Baulches,France.Annual village     
exchanges have led to great friendship 
between the villages and surely to     
greater international understanding.   
Two Women's Institutes belong to the   
Staffordshire Federation and enjoy very
varied programmes.                     
Other clubs include Lacemaking, Mothers
and Toddlers, and Scouts, Guides, Cubs 
and Brownies.
