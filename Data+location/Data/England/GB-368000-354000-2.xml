		<title>02CREWE TOWN CENTRE</title>
		<content> At first glance the shops around Crewe
 look very modern but when you look    
 more carefully you notice the tops of 
 large and small stalls look very old  
 fashioned .It has just been modernised
 downstairs to make the shops look more
 attractive.There is a good choice of  
 shops and usually you can find what   
 you are looking for .Mostly Crewe has 
 larger shops but there are a few small
 like sweet and grocery stalls.There   
 is also a new pedestrian precinct with
 large shops.                          
 Around the centre the roads have been 
 modernised and are now larger and     
 wider.Most times of the day they are  
 very busy .There are a few narrow     
 roads by the market.It is enjoyable to
 shop in Crewe but although it is      
 pleasent it could do with a few more  
 relaxing areas.This would improve the 
 town.                                 </content>
