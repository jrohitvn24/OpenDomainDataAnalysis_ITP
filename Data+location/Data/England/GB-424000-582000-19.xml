		<title>19The Clayhole</title>
		<content>   The Clayhole is a piece of  wetland 
 to be found between the village of    
 Choppington and the Industrial Estate 
 at Barrington. It was once the place  
 where the clay was quarried for the   
 nearby brickworks, hence the name     
 "Clayhole". Nowadays it abounds with  
 natural vegetation and a great variety
 of wild grasses and flowers are to be 
 seen here. Pond-life of all kinds can 
 be found in the form of frogs, newts, 
 sticklebacks and the like. The        
 children of the locality play various 
 games at the Clayhole, making camps   
 and playing hide and seek.            
   At present the local council seem to
 be working on a land reclamation      
 scheme in this area, so what has been 
 a veritable paradise for generations  
 of local children may soon be a thing 
 of the past.                          
                                       </content>
