		<content> Lying between the Berwyn mountains to 
 the west and the undulating north     
 Shropshire plain to the east, this    
 area is characterised by hills and    
 valleys. Standing at high points one  
 is surrounded by picturesque valleys  
 of green. Small tree-lined streams    
 babble along in these{valleys.}The    
 whole countryside is green, though    
 much influenced by man. Most of the   
 land is used for agriculture, improved
{grassland}predominating. Noticeable   
 areas of{coniferous trees}planted     
 within the past forty years add a     
 sylvan touch to the area. However the 
 Candy Woods are mainly{deciduous,}and 
 are threatened by plans to fell them  
 for their timber. The tranquillity of 
 this rural domain contrasts vividly   
 with the hustle and bustle of         
 townscapes.                           
                                       </content>
