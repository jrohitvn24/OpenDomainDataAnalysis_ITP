 are{dairy farms.}Mainly the herds are 
{British Friesian.}One farmer also runs
{sheep}called fatteners on his land in 
 the Spring. Some of these farmers grow
 some{feedstuffs}as well as having     
{maintained grassland for grazing.}Two 
 farms,{Tulley's}and{Worth Hall,}both  
 owned by Mr Beare are completely      
 different. They are{pick-your-own     
 farms. The public are able to pick    
{fresh produce in season.}These farms  
 are very popular and people come from 
 miles around so that they can have    
 really{fresh vegetables}and{fruit.    
 They can also pick enough to fill     
 their freezers. There is a{playground 
 for children and a{picnic area}so that
 families can enjoy a day out. Mr Beare
 is able to employ a lot of people on  
 a part time basis as well as still
