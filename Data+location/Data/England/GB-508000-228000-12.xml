		<title>12A day in my life by Debbie</title>
		<content> My name is{Debbie Russell.}I am aged  
{10}and I live in{Pegsdon.}My mum wakes
 me at 0745. Downstairs I get a welcome
 from my dog. I make toast for         
 breakfast. After breakfast I get      
 dressed, I wash and brush my hair. I  
 say goodbye to my mum and go to{Hexton
{School}in a friends car. School starts
 at 0900 with maths, followed by       
 spelling lessons, after which we have 
 a break. Following break we read and  
 write English. At midday we eat lunch 
 and play until 1315. The afternoon    
 begins with music until 1405 and then,
 in summer, we go swimming to Hitchin  
 Pool. When I get home I watch         
 television or play outside. For tea I 
 usually eat sandwiches. After tea I   
 watch television until it is bedtime  
 at 20.15.
