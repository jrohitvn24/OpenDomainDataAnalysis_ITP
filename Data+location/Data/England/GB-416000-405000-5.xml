		<content> I am Scott Walker,aged 9,and I live   
 just in the NW corner of the block in 
 Lee Terrace. I go to Scholes J&amp;I      
 School.On Monday 24th June I got up   
 at 8am,got dressed and had my         
 breakfast of Shreddies.Then I cleaned 
 my teeth,washed and walked 1/2km up   
 hill to school for 8.55am. After      
 assembly I wrote a story about The    
 Lost Caves. Then it was playtime and I
 played football. Next we did maths    
 work on shapes.Then I went home at    
 11.55am for a dinner of baked beans on
 toast before returning for 1.15pm.    
 During PE I practised limbo dancing   
 for our school carnival .After school 
 at 3.45pm my friend Andrew and I went 
 to my grandma's for tea.Then we went  
 to Hepworth feast and I went in for a 
 running race,but I lost. Afterwards we
 went  to the football club and I had  
 3 drinks of pop before bed at 9.45pm. </content>
