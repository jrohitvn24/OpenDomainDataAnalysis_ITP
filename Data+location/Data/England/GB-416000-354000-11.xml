		<title>11FLOWER FESTIVAL</title>
		<content> On June 29th, the week of Parwich     
 Wakes, there was a flower festival at 
 the church. Mrs. Simpson asked our    
 class to make some flower baskets for 
 the window-sills in the church.       
 The day before, we all brought        
 flowers, leaves and moss to school. We
 had chicken wire in plastic bowls. We 
 fixed moss around the bowls to make   
 them look pretty and made a handle    
 with ivy. Then we arranged the flowers
 and leaves in the baskets.            
  When we were finished, we walked down
 to the church carrying them. Everyone 
 was busy inside. There were huge piles
 of flowers waiting to be arranged.    
 We walked round and had a look at the 
 arrangements. A lot of people in the  
 village helped to decorate the church 
 and even more came to look at the     
 flower festival.
