		<title>14ASTON HALL</title>
		<content>  An important feature of the village  
of Aston-by-Stone is Aston Hall. When  
the estate was given to Robert de Toeni
the Hall was a moated manor house. It  
has been a home of Catholic life for   
over a thousand years. The present Hall
dates back to about 1850 and is now a  
delightful home for retired and        
convalescent priests. They are looked  
after by a community of sisters of     
Charity of St. Paul. There has however 
been a house here since Saxon times.   
  Nearby is the 'home' farm on the     
Aston Estate namely Aston Hall Farm.   
It now has a total acreage of 350 acres
and keeps beef cattle and sheep.
