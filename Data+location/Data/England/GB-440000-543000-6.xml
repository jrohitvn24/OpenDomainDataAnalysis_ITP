		<title>06Life in Easington Colliery 2</title>
		<content> Leon is a member of the Colliery Band.
 He wrote - Life in the Colliery Band  
 is not so easy because I have got to  
 practice almost every night for at    
 least half an hour. That affects me   
 very much because I can't play out.   
 Sometimes I go out after I have       
 finished practising my cornet. A      
 cornet is like a small trumpet. Our   
 band meets at the band hut in the pit 
 yard to practice on Tuesdays and      
 Fridays. Many of the miners spend     
 their leisure time in the colliery    
 either looking after their pigeons or 
 taking care of their allotments. There
 are hundreds of allotments around the 
 colliery.
