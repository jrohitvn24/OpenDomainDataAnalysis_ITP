		<content>     Mrs.Wesson showed us four cottages
 which used to be for farm labourers.  
 They are now made into two and she    
 lives in one. On the wall is a sign   
 which means it is 600ft above sea     
 level.                                
    On{Jesses Lane}there used to be a  
 hole in the ground next to the road.  
 All the women in the village used to  
 meet to do their washing and have a   
 gossip. There may have been a well.   
     {St.Faith's Church}was built in   
 1890 by the Convent of St.Lawrence and
 St.Faith was chosen because she was   
 burned just the same as St. Lawrence. 
 She lived in the 3rd Century in the S.
 of France. The Emperor Diocletian     
 wanted her to worship him but she said
 she only worshipped Jesus Christ. She 
 was burnt alive. She was only 16 years
 old.
