		<title>07HISTORICAL PLACES TO VISIT</title>
		<content>   The historical places to visit in   
 St.Margarets and Turnastone are very  
 few because the area is very rural.One
 of the biggest places to visit is a   
 camp at grid reference 339364.There is
 a famous church at St.Margarets.In the
 church is a plaque which has different
 figures carved into it which make it  
 look like lace embeded into it.       
   There is a castle over-looking the  
 area which is built up on a           
 hill.Another tump is located in the   
 area which is a very beautiful place  
 to visit.                             
   When Queen Elizabeth 1 was on the   
 throne a man called  Roland Vaughan   
 who was her architect designed mills  
 and weirs around the Golden Valley to 
 improve the farming in the area.Some  
 of the building foundations are still 
 to be found today.
