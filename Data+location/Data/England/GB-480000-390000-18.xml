		<title>18The Eagre</title>
		<content>   The River Trent is renowned for the 
 Eagre or tidal bore,named after the   
 chief of the norse sea-giants.It is   
 very unpredictable and in some        
 conditions the tide merely changes    
 the flow of the river.At other times a
 wall of water four or five feet high  
 rushes up the river at a speed of     
 approximately twelve miles per        
 hour,with sufficient power to upturn a
 barge.The tide flows for three hours  
 and ebbs for nine hours.In the days of
 small craft it was the custom to shout
 "'Ware Eagre" to warn fellow boatmen  
 of its approach.From low to high water
 the river may rise up to twelve feet.A
 second disturbance of water known as  
 the "Whelps" follows the Eagre.This is
 caused by the division of the incoming
 tide at Reeds Island in the River     
 Humber.
