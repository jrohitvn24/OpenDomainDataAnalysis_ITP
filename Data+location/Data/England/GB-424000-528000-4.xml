		<title>04A TYPICAL DAY (Part 2)</title>
		<content> My highest score is 19000.It is       
 nowhere near Mr. Farm's highest. My   
 favourite afternoon lesson is craft. I
 like making things out of balsa wood. 
 We made some wooden fish and seals    
 once. During afternoon play I play    
 'Tiggy on high'. I always have to be  
 on! The last lesson is usually used   
 for finishing off work, but we        
 sometimes watch a film. Once a week I 
 have to go for my cornet lesson with  
 Mr. Watson. My cornet is a Getzen     
 Capri. School finishes at 3.40p.m. I  
 walk round to the bus stop with Paul  
 and Simon. When I get home I have to  
 do my cornet and piano practice. I am 
 practising for my Grade 5 exam. After 
 my tea I go upstairs to watch my      
 television. When the news comes on at 
 six o' clock I play on my computer. My
 favourite games are "Matchday" and    
 "Pinball Wizard."        {continued   </content>
