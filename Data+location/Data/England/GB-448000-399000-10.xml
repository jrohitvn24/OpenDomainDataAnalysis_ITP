		<title>10Don and Dearne Landscape.</title>
		<content> The landscape in our area is dominated
 by two rivers called the{River Don}and
 the{River Dearne.}The{Don}flows W to E
 and the{Dearne}flows NW to SE.There is
 a{magnesian limestone}ridge running   
 N to S, which the{Don}cuts through at 
{Conisbrough.}The ridge has a steep    
 edge on the western side of the hill  
 and gently slopes on the eastern side.
 Windhill school is on a hill called   
 Windhill which is between the two     
 rivers,and from our school field we   
 have a view of High Melton and        
 Barnburgh and other villages beyond.  
 Windhill is made of sandstone which is
 softer than the magnesian limestone   
 and the hill does not have a steep    
 face to it.The landscape has been     
 changed by reclaimed pit tips near the
 confluence of the two rivers.
