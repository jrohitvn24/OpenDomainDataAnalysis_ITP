		<title>17Football Hooliganism.</title>
		<content>   Many people think that the          
 hooliganism at Brussels was very sad  
 because the hooligans killed and      
 injured so many innocent spectators.  
   Most people think that it is not    
 fair that English clubs are banned    
 from playing in other countries       
 because it was not the Liverpool fans 
 fault entirely.                       
   A lot of people say that they hope  
 that they have set a good example to  
 their children by  not being          
 hooligans themselves.                 
   Many think that  hooligans should   
 be punished by being put in prison or 
 fined heavily.Some parents are worried
 about watching matches because of the 
 hooligans.
