 We go shopping to Scunthorpe and go   
 into the market first.  Mum picks the 
 fruit and vegetables; we have a       
 cabbage, cauliflower, a pound of      
 carrots and a pound of runner beans.  
 For fruit she buys a pound of Granny  
 Smith's apples, a pound of Outspan    
 oranges, a pound of bananas and four  
 grapefruits.  Next we look for a meat 
 stall and when we find one, we have a 
 pound of pig's liver, a pound of mince
 and the Sunday joint;  this week we   
 are having pork.  When we have done   
 our shopping we find a toy stall.  My 
 sister gets a doll and my brother gets
 a space model and I got a print and   
 colour set and a drawing book.  Next  
 we went to Asda's at Scunthorpe and   
 when we got out of the car we got a   
 trolley for our shopping.  When we had
 finished we paid the lady.            </content>
