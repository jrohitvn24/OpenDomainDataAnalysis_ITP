 classroom,a kitchen cum dining-room, a
 small cloakroom and a playground.There
 are 18 pupils with ages ranging from  
 5-11 years.                           
 Those from Litton Mill and Wardlow    
 come by taxi,but most Wardlow children
 attend Great Hucklow school.At 11years
 of age they transfer to the large     
 comprehensive school at Bakewell.     
 In addition to the usual subjects     
 taught,pupils swim at Edensor pool,   
 join Ashford pupils for extra sports, 
 and perform plays at Christmas.       
 There are 2 teachers and a welfare    
 assistant who travel from outside the 
 area.Despite this fact the school     
 rarely closes in bad weather.In       
 September,when the numbers drop to 13,
 the assistant may have to leave.The   
 lunches are cooked by a part-time cook</content>
