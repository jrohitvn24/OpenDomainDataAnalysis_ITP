 the north side of the valley of the   
 River Rea. It adjoins the village of  
{Brockton.}Although an old community,  
 in the original Domesday book,it has  
 several small modern housing estates. 
 Worthen is a{farming}area,mainly dairy
 farming on improved grassland and     
 drained watermeadows (The Moors).{    
{Fields }are of medium size and many   
 of the original{hedges}remain. Trees  
 are scattered mainly in the hedgerows 
 but there is some planted{woodland }  
 in the east of the area. From the     
 distance the village is recognised by 
 the square tower of the C12 church,   
 and one green silo at Bank Farm.The   
 area is divided  by the Rea and there 
 is only one road-bridge on the B4499.
