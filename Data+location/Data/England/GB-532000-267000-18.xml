		<title>18DRAINING THE FENS</title>
		<content>    In{Fendrayton}is an old{Dutch}home.
 It was built in{1715}for workers      
{draining the fens.}It has a sign      
 saying '{1715 Niet zonder hrbyt}'which
 means{'Nothing gained without labour}'
    In 1712 England began thinking     
 about draining the fens.The Duke of   
 Bedford put in a lot of money. Then   
 the eager Dutch came over to drain    
 them. They wanted the money and the   
 fertile soil which was very good for  
 growing crops.                        
    There were also some{Scottish      
{prisoners}who were forced to help.    
    The{fen men}were very angry and    
 worried that they would lose the sort 
 of life that they had lived.They would
 lose their houses and would not be    
 free anymore.They would have to work  
 for other people.There was a lot of   
 terror and deaths but finally the     
 Dutch managed to{drain the fens.      </content>
