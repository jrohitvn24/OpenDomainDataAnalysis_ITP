 have some chime bars &amp; a xylophone &amp;  
 every Monday we have recorders. We    
 paint fairy-tales but sometimes we    
 paint animals' heads.Every Wednesday  
 afternoon we have a crafty afternoon  
 &amp; we like that best of all.

 of Gloucester",we all dress up in cos-
 tumes.The characters are the Tailor,  
 Simpkin,the Mayor &amp; the Mice.We sing

{We do spellings on Wednesdays,}hand-  
 writing &amp; science writing.            
{We go out to play after Assembly.}Some
 times we have fruit.The boys are      
 always running about &amp; pulling the    
 girls' hair. One boy is a bit naughty.

 ropes.{By 7 year olds from Tacolneston
