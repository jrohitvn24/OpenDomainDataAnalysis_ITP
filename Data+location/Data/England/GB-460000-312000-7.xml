 The school is old.It doesn't have much
 space.There is a library up some      
 stairs with a lot of books.  Our      
 class is small.We are up a path in a  
 mobile. We can contact the old school 
 on the intercom.Our mobile is in the  
 middle of the field .The field is     
 quite big with a stile up the top and 
 a sandpit.We have slabs round our     
 mobile.When it is sunny we go out.We  
 have a barrel and water and bricks and
 cars.The playground is round the      
 school it is very small.There's a pond
 round the back of school and a        
 greenhouse. It has got all glass round
 it.We have flower beds all over the   
 place down the path and all round the 
 mobile.
