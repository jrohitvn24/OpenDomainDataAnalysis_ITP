		<title>02WOLD NEWTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content>   {Wold Newton}is a typical Wolds     
 village. It lies in a sheltered       
 position in the Wolds Depression,     
 on the site of a number of springs.   
 There is evidence of habitation in    
 the area of the village dating back to
{Neolithic}times-a period of nearly    
 5000 years. There are many{Iron Age}  
 burial grounds in the area.           
    The Wold Valley stream is a well   
 known occasional watercourse called   
 the{Gypsey Race}(with a hard 'g'). The
 name derives from the word 'geyser'   
 which in turn comes from the Norse    
 'gypa'- a spring.Gypseys are streams  
 which flow intermittently. The water  
 comes from natural underground        
 reservoirs and when the water rises to
 a particular level it is siphoned to  
 the surface.The mystery is that this  
 often occurs after a dry season!
