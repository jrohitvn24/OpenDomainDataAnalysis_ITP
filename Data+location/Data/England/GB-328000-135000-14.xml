		<title>14CHANGING INDUSTRY</title>
		<content> This area has had a long industrial   
 history. At one time much of the area 
 was covered with clay pits, kilns,    
 drying sheds etc.  The clay was used  
 to make bricks and tiles - then the   
 premier industry in Bridgwater.  None 
 of these works remain and the pits    
 have mostly been infilled to provide  
 land for a new series of industrial   
 and commercial development. This      
 includes warehousing, transport and   
 machinery stores, timber merchants and
 small manufacturing units. The very   
 last kiln in this area has survived.  
 There are plans to restore it as a    
 reminder of Bridgwater's industrial   
 past. There is an extensive cattle    
 market held each Wednesday. On sale   
 there are sheep, lambs, steers, cows  
 and calves. There is an abattoir on   
 site which deals with some of the     
 animals passing through the market.   </content>
