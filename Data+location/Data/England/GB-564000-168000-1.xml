		<content>  This is a predominantly rural area   
 bounded to the North by the A2,a busy 
 dual carriageway linking Dover to     
 London and acting as a by-pass for all
 the North Kent towns.The A2 also acts 
 as a boundary for the building        
 developement spreading South from     
 Gravesend.Much of the area is devoted 
 to farming ,mainly cereal crops are   
 grown ,most of the more traditional   
 orchards and hop fields have now been 
 replaced.Some farms are growing       
 strawberries as a new venture.        
    Tucked in to the South-West corner 
 of the block is the picturesque       
 village of Cobham.The village has a   
 number of interesting buildings.      
 Although this is still very much a    
 rural area,the agricultural community 
 has given way to a more commuter based
 society.
