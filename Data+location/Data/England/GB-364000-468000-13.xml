		<title>13MR BRUCE BENTHAM</title>
		<content> We visited Mr Bruce of "Lochaber",    
 Robin Lane, High Bentham. He said how 
 Bentham has changed over the last 50  
 years. The main differences are:-     
 The roads used to be unsurfaced and   
 the main road between High and Low    
 Bentham was narrow, winding and unlit 
 with very few houses. 50 years ago    
 cars were very rare in Bentham. There 
 are now about the same number of shops
 but their uses have changed. Nowadays 
 most food is pre-packaged, whereas in 
 the past everything had to be weighed 
 out separately by the grocer.         
 High Bentham used to have a cinema    
 which is no longer there but it does  
 now have it's own health centre and   
 fire station.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
