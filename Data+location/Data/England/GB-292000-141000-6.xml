		<content> When he died in 1714 Richard Elsworth 
 of Bickham left money to establish a  
 school here.Today the Elsworth Trust  
 is responsible for the maintenance of 
 the outer fabric of the school.There  
 is an annual allocation to cover this 
 and various other items of educational
 value.The catchment area covers       
 Timberscombe,Luccombe and Wootton     
 Courtenay both the latter villages    
 having lost their schools in1946 and  
 1947 respectively.Today there are 25  
 children in the school,13 Timberscombe
 5 from Luccombe and 7 from Wootton.In 
 Nov.1984,the decision was taken by    
 Somerset to review the schools future 
 The support from parents and the comm-
 unity was overwhelming as an organisa-
 tion was set up to campaign against   
 closure. They were successful. When   
 the vote was taken in Feb.1985 the    
 decision not to close was unanimous.  </content>
