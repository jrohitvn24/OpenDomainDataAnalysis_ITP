		<content>     Hythe is one of the Cinque Ports  
 whose history dates back to the 11th  
 century. During the reign of{Edward 1 
 the confederation had its services and
 privileges established by{Royal       
{Charter. }The services consisted of   
 supplying ships and seaman for the    
 defence of the coast and the channel  
 crossing providing the main part of   
 the Royal fleet. In return the        
 portsmen were granted freedom from    
 certain tolls and taxes; a common     
 court of justice held at Shepway near 
 Lympne, and the right to send         
 representatives to the sovereign's    
 coronation and to carry a canopy over 
 the King and another over the Queen in
 the procession from{Westminster Hall  
 to the{Abbey.}Hythe was used to       
 provide ships and people to look after
 and protect the south east.
