		<content> WORSHIP- SAXON CHURCHES.In 1985       
 religion does not seem to be as       
 important as it used to be.There are  
 67 members of Gt.Paxton church but    
 only about 20 people regularly worship
 there.It's vicar,the Reverend E.Pryke 
 has recently retired and moved to     
 Devon,so at present there is no       
 permanent vicar.Nevertheless the Saxon
 church is very interesting and        
 notable.It is one of the largest late 
 Saxon churches in England and seems to
 have been copied from continental     
 churches in the 10th century.The      
 original church was built around      
 1020A.D.and the chancel was added in  
 the 13th century.In the 14th c.,the   
 porch was built and the tower too.The 
 aisles were rebuilt in the 15th c.Some
 windows were addad in the chancel and 
 the buttresses built.A major          
 restoration took place in 1880.       </content>
