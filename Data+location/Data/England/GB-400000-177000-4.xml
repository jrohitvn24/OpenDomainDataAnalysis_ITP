 CAMPAIGN WAS FIRSTLY TO MOVE STORES   
 AND PERSONNEL TO ASCENSION ISLAND     
 BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF THE TASK FORCE  
 AND THEN, TO ESTABLISH A SPEEDY AND   
 CONTINUOUS LINE OF SUPPLY OF PERSONNEL

 WAS USED TO RE-SUPPLY THE TASK FORCE  
 SOUTH OF ASCENSION AND ON TO THE      
 FALKLANDS AS WELL.  THE AIRCRAFT HAD  
 TO BE MODIFIED SO THAT THEY COULD BE  
 REFUELLED IN THE AIR.  THIS WAS A NEW 
 ROLE FOR THE AIRCRAFT AND TRIALS WHICH
 BEGAN ON 3 MAY WERE COMPLETED A WEEK  
 LATER.  BY THE FALL OF STANLEY ON 14  
 JUNE A TOTAL OF 44 AIRDROPS OF        
 EQUIPMENT AND MEN HAD BEEN MADE USING 
 AIR-TO-AIR REFUELLING.  ON 24 JUNE A  
 R.A.F. HERCULES LANDED AT STANLEY FOR 
 THE FIRST TIME.
