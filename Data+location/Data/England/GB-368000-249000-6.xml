		<content> There is a sub-post office at Acton   
 Green. The present postmistress has   
 held this position for l9 years,      
 before her mother ran the post office 
 for 52 years and she took over from   
 her father. So the post office has    
 been run by one family for about l00  
 years. There is one postal delivery in
 the morning, letters usually arrive   
 between 9.0 and l0.0 am. There is a   
 collection at the post office in the  
 morning on weekdays and at 4.0 pm.    
 except for Saturday. There are two    
 other letter boxes in the area so many
 people are a mile or more from a      
 collection point. The postmen are     
 helpful and will take letters for post
 and will also collect pensions. There 
 is one telephone kiosk at Acton Green,
 most houses have telephones. Until    
 recently there were many party lines  
 but more lines have been provided.    </content>
