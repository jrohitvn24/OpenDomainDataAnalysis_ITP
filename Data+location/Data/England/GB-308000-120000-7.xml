		<title>07COMPUTER DAIRY FARMING</title>
		<content>  One dairy farmer in our square uses a
 computer to help him with his herd of 
 111 friesians. All the cows have a    
 collar around their necks, it is      
 called a transponder. The computer can
 tell how old the cow is, how many     
 calves it has had and how much food it
 eats a day.In the milking parlour ten 
 cows stand each side of the milking   
 machine but only ten cows can be      
 milked at one time. The machine is    
 connected to the computer which       
 records the amount of milk given by   
 each cow.                             
  After milking the large glass bottles
 are taken to the dairy where the milk 
 is pasturised. This is done by passing
 the milk through a special machine    
 which raises its temperature to 72'C  
 this kills off all the germs. The milk
 is then cooled and bottled.
