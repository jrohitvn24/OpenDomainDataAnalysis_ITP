		<content> Everyone has different views on       
{leisure pursuits.}A common denominator
 over this area might well be the      
 enjoyment of one's garden and D.I.Y.  
 handiwork,with TV and reading as      
 favourite indoor pastimes.{Collecting 
 stamps,postcards,shells,fossils,medals
 and coins or even old bottles is      
 popular and family history research is
 another activity of growing attraction
 Leisure in the home can include       
{hospitality:}friends and relations    
 from other parts of the country enjoy 
 visting such a lovely area.           
 Only a few people would belong to     
{sports}teams in nearby centres but    
 more may take advantage of squash,    
 swimming or badminton there.Youngsters
 engage in motocross.{Fox hunting}is   
 well supported,especially by farming  
 people.Locally there is game and rough
 shooting.                             </content>
