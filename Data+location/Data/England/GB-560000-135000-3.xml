		<title>03The Brecknock Arms</title>
		<content>  The Brecknock Arms is situated in the
 centre of Bells Yew Green opposite a  
 small village green.  When the        
 building was first erected in{1880}it 
 was a house and the original pub was  
 on the Green.  This was soon knocked  
 down and the house was converted into 
 the{village pub.} The landlord has    
 been there five months and he enjoys  
 being a landlord.  It is his first    
 pub. The{busiest times}are Friday     
 night, and Saturday and Sunday in the 
 evenings, especially after cricket    
 matches in the summer.  Cricket clubs 
 have meetings in the bar sometimes.   
 The{services}that the pub provides are
 morning coffee, drinks, lunches and   
 evening meals.  The customers come    
 from{Bells Yew Green, Frant and       
{Tunbridge Wells.} The landlord said   
 that{smoking}has decreased recently.
