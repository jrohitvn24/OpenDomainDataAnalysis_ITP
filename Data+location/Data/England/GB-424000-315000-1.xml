		<content> The block 0424315 lies in the far     
 south of Derbyshire,close to the main 
 trunk roads the A444,A38 &amp; A50.These  
 roads provide easy access to many of  
 the larger towns in the Midlands.Also 
 the main N.E to S.W railway lines runs
 through Burton-on-Trent five miles    
 away.It is very rural area containing 
 the villages of Linton,Coton in the   
 Elms,Rosliston,Coton Park &amp; Caldwell. 
 There is a strong sense of developed  
 community spirit which has grown up   
 through coalmining traditions.Some of 
 the "pits" are still open today and   
 employ many fathers,but the population
 tend to travel to Burton to work in   
 the brewery and associated industries 
 or the power station at Drakelow.     
 Housing is a mixture of private and   
 council properties ranging in price   
 range and age some being extremely    
 old.                                  </content>
