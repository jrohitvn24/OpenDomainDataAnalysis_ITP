		<title>15A Prison Officer</title>
		<content>  At Highpoint Prison,officers perform 
 many different duties,such as         
 patrolling the very high double       
 fence,taking charge of a Wing of the  
 prison,radio officers,kitchen officers
 and such specialists as P.E. and      
 education officers.                   
   An officer works shifts but has to  
 do a lot of overtime which is well    
 paid.He has to carry an identity card 
 and a truncheon at all times.The      
 prisoners have to be counted as they  
 move from place to place,and locked up
 at night,but as this is a category    
 'C'prison they do not need to be      
 locked up all the time.               
   Some of the officers live at the    
 prison in the former quarters of      
 R.A.F.Stradishall.They have a Social  
 Club and a sports ground there.       
                                       
                                       </content>
