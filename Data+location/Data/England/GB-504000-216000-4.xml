    Our school is Markyate J.M.I.      
 school. The school day begins at      
 8.55am till 3.30pm  with a dinner     
 break from 12 noon to 1.20pm  and 2   
 shorter breaks.The Infants start at   
 8.55 too  but finish at 3.25pm  with a
 dinner break at 12.00 till 1.30pm  and
 2 shorter breaks. The Infants have 3  
 classes and so do the Juniors.        
   After school there are various clubs
 such as Rounders, Book Club, Board    
 Games Club, Football Club and a       
 Computer Club. Every year the older   
 children go on a school trip, often to
 Wales. We are going to Tenby this     
 year. At the age of 11 pupils leave   
 this school to go to a school in Hemel
 Hempstead or St.Albans. We have to    
 travel to Secondary School by coach so
 it makes the day longer.
