The village of Dagnall has grown       
considerably over the last twenty      
years.There are two farms,some terraced
villas, a chapel and a school all      
dating from Victorian times, and some  
council houses and larger private      
houses built recently.The community    
life of the village is served by a     
village hall built about seventy years 
ago and the village is continuing to   
grow with the addition of new private  
housing.There are strong community     
links between Dagnall and the larger   
neighbouring village of Edlesborough.
