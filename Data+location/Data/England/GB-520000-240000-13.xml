		<content> A WORKING WOMAN'S VIEW: I am a married
 woman with a daughter of 23,I've lived
 here for 13 years.My husband and I own
 and work in two shops in Stevenage.   
 Since I work most days most of my soc-
 ial activities take place in the even-
 ings I belong to the W.I.and am on the
 Village Hall management committee.Also
 I do Keep Fit and craft classes.I shop
 in Stevenage and do housework on my   
 day off on Friday.I enjoy living here 
 and find there are plenty of opportun-
 ities to get involved in village life.
 A HOUSEWIFE'S VIEW:My day is very busy
 what with having to walk the two dogs,
 get my 3 year old son David ready for 
 play school in Ashwell and my husband 
 off to work by 8:30 am.I clean the pub
 in the morning, amuse my son in the   
 afternoon and once a week lead a Brow-
 nie pack.My husband works a 5 1/2 day 
 week so we only have Sundays together.</content>
