		<content>{Fallow}and{Roe}deer are found         
 throughout these inclosures. The      
 Japanese race of{Sika}deer is found to
 the south of the railway line which   
 effectively cuts this area into two   
 sections. The Fallow and Roe deer do  
 cross from one side to the other to   
 the west towards Brockenhurst. One    
{Muntjac,}a Chinese Reeves deer was    
 sighted in 1981.                      
 Apart from the effect of the railway  
 line, the deer are not restricted in  
 their movements, but being woodland   
 creatures they tend to keep to the    
 forest and only venture out into the  
 open in search of extra food in the   
 middle of winter.{The deer live off   
{the forest}and are only fed by man    
 under harsh conditions. Outside the   
 breeding season in October females can
 be seen in small family groups and    
 males in larger groups of 20 to 30.   </content>
