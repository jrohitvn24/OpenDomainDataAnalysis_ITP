		<title>01Chatteris - Gazetteer</title>
		<content> This fen area is on the outskirts of  
 Chatteris, a small market town with a 
 population of about 6,000 people.  The
 land is used mainly for intense arable
 farming, (carrots, barley, sugar beet,
 potatoes) with the odd meadow left for
 grazing.  Except for the west of the  
 area which has a small private and    
 council estate, the district is very  
 sparsely populated with only the odd  
 farmhouse or labourer's cottage, (now 
 often occupied by "newcomers.")  Two  
 main waterways, the Forty and Sixteeen
 Foot drains cross the area which is   
 also covered with a network of droves 
 or tracks leading to farms.           
                                       
                                       
 Farming - arable, meadowland.         
 Housing - private estate, council     
 houses, farmhouses, cottages.
