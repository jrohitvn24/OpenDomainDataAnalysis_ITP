		<title>15Tourism In Mayfield.</title>
		<content> Mayfield has a lot of visitors,mostly 
 in the Summer,because it is a very    
 typical 'old_world' English village,  
 surrounded by beautiful countryside.It
 is a very good base for touring both  
 Kent &amp; Sussex.Mayfield has one hotel, 
 The Middle House,built in the 16th    
 century.There are also 5 public       
 houses,a restaurant,tea_rooms,2 guest 
 houses,&amp; B&amp;B accommodation in one of  
 the public houses.Many of the visitors
 to Mayfield come from abroad,mostly   
 from America,but French,Dutch,Irish &amp; 
 Spanish etc.as well as British people 
 come here.During the Winter Mayfield  
 has fewer visitors but The Middle     
 House often has conference groups &amp;   
 the restaurant is always busy.Parents 
 of the College &amp; Convent children also
 use the tourist facilities.Many       
 visitors just spend a few hours in    
 Mayfield to explore the lovely village</content>
