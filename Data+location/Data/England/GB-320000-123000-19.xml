		<title>19PRIMARY SCHOOL DAY</title>
		<content>  Our work is normally writing,  Maths,
 Science, History or Geography.  On    
 Mondays we read for quite a long time.
 I like reading in the hall and        
 watching television.  At playtime some
 children play football in the         
 playground or on the field.  I        
 practise cartwheels or play touch.  We
 have swimming in the school pool twice
 a week.  In summer we play rounders   
 and cricket, but in winter the games  
 are football and netball.  I like     
 building with meccano and drawing. At 
 3p.m. each day our class listens to a 
 story.                                
  We have singing every week and some  
 children play recorders and other     
 musical instruments in the school     
 orchestra.  We use the computer for   
 our work sometimes.
