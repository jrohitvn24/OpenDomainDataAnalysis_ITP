		<content> The{largest farm}in the area is       
 owned by Mr.E.H.Vestey.This is not    
 typical of other farms in Ashdon,for  
 more than half the total acreage is   
 devoted to pasture and woodland.At    
 Ricketts Farm there are currently 800 
 breeding ewes including Pedigree      
 Suffolk,Scotch half breeds and a few  
 "mules".In addition there are 28      
 Suffolk rams,10 Suffolk ram lambs and 
 33 Suffolk gimmer lambs (young sheep  
 that have lambed only once).This      
 spring 1217 lambs were born and there 
 are 900 at the moment ,the rest having
 been sold.                            
    At Newnham Hall Farm there is a    
 dairy herd of 120 Red Friesian cows   
 plus 90 followers.The estate consists 
 of 397 acres of arable land,342 acres 
 of pasture (including 100 acres for   
 silage)and 92 acres of woodland .There
 are over 20 horses(not working).      </content>
