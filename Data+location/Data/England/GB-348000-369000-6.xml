		<content> We have a lot of clubs in Ashton for  
 young and old people. For the young we
 have Brownies, Cubs, Scouts and Guides
 . For middle-aged people W.I.,        
 Gardening Club, Flower Club, Slimming 
 Club and P.T.A.Activities. For        
 teenagers there is the A.C.F. and     
 Youth Club. Old Age Pensioners have   
 the Golden Club. Most people in Ashton
 go to clubs or some kind of           
 association and one quarter of the    
 people go to clubs outside Ashton.    
 Most clubs meet in their own hut. When
 asked if they thought there were      
 sufficent clubs in Ashton 2/3 said yes
 and 1/3 said no.These are some of the 
 clubs people would like to see in the 
 village; Tennis ,Football, Gymnastics,
 Badminton,Table Tennis, Sports,       
 History ,and Bridge.
