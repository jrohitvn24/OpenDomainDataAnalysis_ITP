		<title>10PUBLIC TRANSPORT</title>
		<content>  Public Transport is very cheap in our
 area, because South Yorkshire         
 county council subsidises it from     
 the rates and our buses are the       
 cheapest in                           
 Britain.Therefore a lot of people use 
 buses as a main form of transport.We  
 surveyed 100 people in our area and   
 asked them to answer Questions on     
 transport.Here are our results:       
 72% had a car and 28% didn't.         
 24% had other types of transport.4%   
 had a motorbike,68% had a bicycle.100%

 bus most.60% used a car most.12% of   
 the people had a caravan,88% didn't
