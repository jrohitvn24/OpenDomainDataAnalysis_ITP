		<title>14New housing in Clacton</title>
		<content>     Our house was built in two back   
 gardens and we designed it. When the  
 plans were finished the brickies came 
 in and dug the foundations and built  
 the walls. The door frames were put in
 and the lintel was put over the door  
 frames and the window frames.         
     When the brickies reached roof    
 height the trusses came in. So did the
 water-proof sheets and tiles. After   
 that the top floor came in and all the
 wooden beams were put up along with   
 the floorboards. Then came the upper  
 walls and ceiling. The plasterers     
 were next and they did all the walls  
 for us so we could move in. The house 
 smelt different and new. It felt      
 colder than it did in our old house.  
 Men used to come in almost every day  
 to do something different to the      
 house but soon the house was finished.
