		<title>19Brockhampton Manor(History)</title>
		<content> Within the chief manor,which has been 
 attached to the See of Hereford from  
 a period before the Domesday Survey,  
 a number of less important manors are 
 included.Of these one of the most     
 important is Brockhampton which lies  
 in the town ship of Norton and gave   
 its name to a family seated there     
 early in the thirteenth century.      
 Richard son of Robert de Brockhampton 
 sold his lands and the advowson of the
 chapel to Robert de Furches circa     
 1203. Soon afterwards they were in the
 possession of the Solers family and   
 by about the middle of the fourteenth 
 century were held by Sir Thomas le    
 Moigne,hence they probably passed to  
 the Rowdons but there is no proof.The 
 Domultons were the next proprietors   
 succeeded by the Habingtons.At the    
 death of JR.Habington,the elder       
 daughter married Richard Barneby.     </content>
