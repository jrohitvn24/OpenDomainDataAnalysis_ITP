		<title>15REDHILLS  TODAY</title>
		<content>   {Redhills}is on the outskirts of{   
{Exeter.}You go only one mile and you  
 are in the countryside.{Redhills}is in
 two separate parts, Lower Redhills and
 Higher Redhills. In between is a      
 massive hill that is very steep. It   
 takes about ten or fifteen minutes to 
 walk up. During the summer it is very 
 tiresome to walk up the hill.         
    Up at the top of{Redhills}there are
 new houses being built which are lower
 down in the valley. I live on a very  
 new estate which was built about three
 years ago.{                           
{ } The area is called{Redhills}because
 before peole started to build here    
 there were hills which were red       
 because of the{colour of the soil.    
    The{soil}is very hard to dig when  
 planting shrubs or trees.
