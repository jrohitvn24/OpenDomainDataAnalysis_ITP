 This year we have been quite          
 successful,in competitions.In June    
 this year we were asked to sing in the
 Norwich Sing For Pleasure Festival    
 with nine other choirs, for the second
 time. We also attended the            
 International Musical Eisteddfod in   
 Llangollen,for the second time. We    
 came fifth in the Preliminarys but    
 unfortunately did not get through to  
 the final in the marquee.             </content>
