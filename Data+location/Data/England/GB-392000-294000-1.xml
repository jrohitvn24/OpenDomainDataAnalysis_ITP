		<title>01Bilston and its surroundings</title>
		<content> Now part of Wolverhampton, Bilston was
for many centuries an important iron   
and steel making area. It is now       
struggling to recover from the closing 
of its major employers, the steelworks,
and its associated industries.         
 Because of high unemployment many     
shops have closed though the market is 
still a busy one.   The main shopping  
area extends along one street which    
also contains Bilston's two oldest     
buildings, St. Leonard's Church and the
Greyhound and Punchbowl Inn. Close to  
the town centre is Hickman Park, a     
popular and attractive place, with its 
flower beds, shrubs,trees and grassy   
playing areas. It is also the site of  
the annual carnival.                   
 The remainder of the area surveyed    
consists both of old Industrial        
villages and farmlands all now merged  
by industrial and urban development.   </content>
