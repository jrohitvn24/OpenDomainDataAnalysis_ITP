      "Kelland's" by Patrick Curran.   
    Kelland's sell construction        
 machinery to County councils, quarries
 and the construction industry. They   
 are agents for Massey-Ferguson        
 diggers, Hanomag swing shovels,       
 Haulomatic dumptrucks  and Perkins    
 engines. Jellands also do after-sales 
 service on those machines.            
    My dad is a service engineer at    
 Kelland's. He services and repairs the
 machines that they sell, as well as   
 other plant. His duties include       
 welding, fabrication and repair of the
 machinery. He does a lot of travelling
 in his job, working on site repairing 
 machines which have broken down,      
 driving to and from Bridgwater when   
 very heavy spares have to be          
 transported to Delabole,
