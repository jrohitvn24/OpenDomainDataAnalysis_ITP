		<title>16Our School Cleaners</title>
		<content>   The caretaker looks after our       
 school, with cleaners to help him. We 
 like our caretaker because he always  
 keeps our school clean and tidy. He   
 comes to school at 7 o'clock every    
 morning and he and the cleaners make  
 sure the school is ready for us to    
 start at 9 o'clock. They come back    
 when we finish at half past 3 and     
 clean up after us. The caretaker is in
 the canteen before dinner to put out  
 the tables and benches for us. After  
 dinner he puts them away and sweeps   
 the canteen floor.  The cleaners clean
 the school toilets with disinfectant  
 to kill the germs and they wipe the   
 sinks. If we lose a ball on the school
 roof the caretaker climbs up and gets 
 it down for us.
