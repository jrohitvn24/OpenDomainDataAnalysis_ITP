		<title>01OUR AREA OF STUDY</title>
		<content> This is mainly a rural area lying to  
 the South of the A5 trunk road and to 
 the East of the new M42 motorway in   
 the Borough of North Warwickshire.It  
 includes the villages of Baddesley    
 Ensor,Baxterley,Wood End and part of  
 Grendon.The main industry in the area 
 is farming although there are two coal
 mines,Birch Coppice and Baddesley.    
 People who live in the area either    
 work at the mines or in the nearby    
 towns of Atherstone,Nuneaton or       
 Tamworth.The population tends to be   
 reasonably static and there has been  
 little new housing development in the 
 last ten years.The villages are still 
 very much a close community and there 
 are many recurring family names.The   
 atmosphere is generally quiet with    
 residents enjoying fine views over the
 surrounding countryside and yet easy  
 access to the large Midland cities.   </content>
