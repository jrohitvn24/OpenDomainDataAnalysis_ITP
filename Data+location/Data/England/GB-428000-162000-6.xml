		<title>06LAW and ORDER IN SHALBOURNE</title>
		<content> Four years ago, the{village policeman 
{was removed}and the police house sold.
 We now share a policeman on the beat  
 with Burbage. If we need the police,  
 other than in an emergency, we have to
 phone Marlborough.                    
 Vandalism in the district is mostly of
 petty nature: breaking off of plants, 
 dropping litter, removing and breaking
 road and house signs.   There is too  
 much{speeding}through the village.    
 There are few pavements and a speed   
 limit is not allowed as there is no   
 street lighting.  The roads are very  
 narrow, with several blind corners    
 contributing to accidents.  There have
 been several{burglaries}in the area in
 the last five years: the nearness to  
 the M4 motorway makes access and get- 
 away easy. Several burglar alarms have
 been installed and no one now leaves  
 doors or windows unlocked.            </content>
