		<title>15N.Upottery: Leisure  2</title>
		<content>   We had a Crafts and Hobbies display 
 in connection with the Flower Festival
 this summer and it was abundantly     
 clear that a lot of our leisure time  
 was spent on creative work of a very  
 varied range.These are individual     
 pastimes,but we do get together a     
 great deal for communal activities,   
 more so,I think,than in the towns.    
 Going to the theatre is often a group 
 expedition,organised by ,for instance,
 the W.I.This organisation,the         
 Sports Clubs,the Mothers'Union,the    
 Bellringers,the Young Farmers(famed as
 a matrimonial agency!),the Whist      
 Club,the Church in Upottery and the   
 Baptists in Smeatharpe keep us all    
 busy:and the number of charity sales, 
 garden parties,sponsored this and     
 that,classes,coffee mornings and      
 dramatic productions is endless.
