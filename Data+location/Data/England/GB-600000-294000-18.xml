		<title>18ATTLEBOROUGH BYPASS</title>
		<content> THE ATTLEBOROUGH BYPASS WAS OPENED IN 
 THE SPRING OF 1985.IT WAS BUILT AS A  
 MUCH NEEDED RELIEF ROAD FOR THE TOWN  
 OF ATTLEBOROUGH.                      
 THE ROAD HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF MUCH 
 COTROVERSY BEING MAINLY               
 SINGLE-CARRIAGEWAY APART FROM ONE VERY
 SHORT DUAL-CARRIAGEWAY SECTION.THERE  
 HAS ALREADY BEEN ONE{FATAL CRASH      
 BETWEEN A FRENCH LORRY AND A          
 COACH.SEVERAL PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN   
 THE CRASH AND LOCAL POLITICIANS AND   
 MEDIA ARE NOW STATING THAT THE ROAD IS
{UNSAFE}AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN DUALLED   
 FOR ITS ENTIRE LENGTH.                
 IT IS YET ANOTHER FACTOR IN THE       
 CONTINUING CAMPAIGN TO HAVE THE{A11   
{TRUNK ROAD IMPROVED,}OF WHICH THE     
 BYPASS FORMS A SECTION.               
 IT IS THOUGHT BY MANY TO BE THE WORST 
 AND MOST DANGEROUS TRUNK ROAD IN THE  
 COUNTRY.                              </content>
