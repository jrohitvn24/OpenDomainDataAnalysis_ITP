		<title>13SHOTESHAM/HOWE LOCAL HISTORY</title>
		<content> There are two villages in the area.   
 SHOTESHAM derives from the Saxon      
 Scottsham, a settlement by a man      
 called Scott or by Scots. Previously  
 called Scotessa or Scotessam.         
 HOWE derives from the Scandinavian    
 hill or barrow. In the Domesday Book  
 it was called "HOU".                  
 The city of Durban, South Africa was  
 named after Benjamin D'Urban. He lived
 in Shotesham as a boy and as Commander
 _in_Chief of the Cape landed at Natal 
 and left his name.                    
 Henry Howard, former Earl of          
 Northampton, was born in Shotesham    
 early in the 16th century. As a result
 his charitable trust endows a row of 8
 cottages and a small hall,the Trinity 
 Hospital, for the use of old people.  
 The family of Anna Sewell, of Black   
 Beauty fame, are buried at Howe.      
 Roman remains have been found here.   </content>
