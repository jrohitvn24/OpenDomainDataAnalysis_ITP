		<content>This work has been compiled by members 
of the SIXTH FORM of Princes Risborough
County Secondary School. The courses   
that they follow at School are         
vocationally based with hire for       
general studies around the main        
courses. Two periods a week are given  
over to humanities and it has been     
during this time in the summer term    
1985,that the work has been done. There
were only five pupils in the group,    
aided by one member of staff. They all 
thoroughly enjoyed looking at their    
area in more detail and compiling the  
data. They were also pleased with the  
idea that their work would be recorded 
for posterity.
