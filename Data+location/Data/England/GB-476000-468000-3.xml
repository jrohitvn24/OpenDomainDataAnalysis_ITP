		<content> An excellent 18 hole golf course is   
 situated to the south-west of the town
 in some delightful countryside and the
 river Derwent provides good           
 opportunities for angling. The local  
 Ramblers' Association arrange         
 interesting walks to suit all ages and
 abilties.                             
                                       
 Norton-on-Derwent is semi-rural. It   
 has seen, during the past twelve      
 years, a rapid expansion of           
 residential development. However, it  
 has managed to retain an air of       
 tranquility with reasonable amenities;
 a situation which many who are subject
 to the more extreme environment may   
 envy.
