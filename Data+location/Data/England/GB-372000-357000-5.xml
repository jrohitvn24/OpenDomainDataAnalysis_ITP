		<content> We play{Hide and Seek}like this.      
 Somebody counts up to 50 and the      
 others hide.When the counter has      
 counted up to 50 she says "Coming     
 ready or not".Then she goes looking   
 for the others.If she sees any of     
 them she says 1,2,3 and the persons   
 name she has seen.If she hasn't seen a
 person then the person can go to the  
 post and say "Freedom all" and then   
 another person is on.                 
 This is how we play{Rounders.         
 We have 4 bases,a ball and a bat.The  
 bowler throws the ball to you,you hit 
 the ball then you drop the bat and run
 around the 4 bases.If you managed to  
 get a rounder you have to touch 4th   
 base with your foot.If you are half   
 way between any of the bases and a    
 person stumps the base you are running
 to you will be out.You can be caught  
 out.                                  </content>
