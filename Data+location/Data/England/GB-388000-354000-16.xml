		<content>  On a typical school day I usually    
rise at 7.30 a.m.After dressing,       
washing ,breakfasting and feeding the  
cat I leave home at 8.20 a.m to go to  
school. My younger sister also         
accompanies me, as her school is en    
route to the High School.My journey on 
foot normally takes twenty minutes,but 
this can vary depending upon the       
punctuality of my friends.             
  School hours are from 8.55a.m.to     
3.35p.m.with a mid-morning break of    
15 minutes and a lunch break of 1 hour.
  Evenings are occupied with homework  
and reading,followed by television.The 
fmily evening meal is usually at 7p.m.,
typically salad and pizza,with a       
yoghurtfor a sweet.This is followed by 
whashing the dishes.                   
  I usually retire at about 11-30p.m.  
after reading or listening to music.
