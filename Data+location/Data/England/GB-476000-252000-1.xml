		<title>01Courteenhall/Quinton Village</title>
		<content> The area contains the two small       
 villages of Courteenhall &amp; Quinton. In
 Courteenhall is the Stately home of   
 Sir Hereward &amp; Lady Wake. At Quinton  
 Green is the large Farm complex which 
 is run by Mr. R. Turney and only part 
 of his farming interests. The area is 
 a mainly rural one with many scattered
 farms and houses. The ancient mostly  
 deciduous Salcey forest enters the    
 south east corner. The block is       
 crossed from south east to north west 
 by the M1 Motorway. All other         
 thoroughfares are minor roads, and was
 crossed by the former SMJ railway.    
 Apart from the two villages 90% of the
 land is arable and used for growing   
 wheat and oil seed rape, and for      
 grazing for the herds of dairy cattle,
 the remaining are is forested.
