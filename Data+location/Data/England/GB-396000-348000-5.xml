		<title>05Housing in the Consall area</title>
		<content>Due to drastic increases in population 
housing projects are now being         
developed on a large scale. Most       
houses in Britain are now built on a   
large estates. There are of various    
designs but often have small gardens.  
      Housing in the Wetley Rocks and  
Consall area differs from this as it is
a rural area.Many of the houses are    
dated farm houses which are large and  
generally old the oldest dating from   
Tudor times.                           
      In the village housing again is  
generally older than in the city with  
Terraces and Detached houses often     
being built of local stone. Some       
modern houses do exist but have been   
well planned not to exist but they have
been well planned not to spoil the     
character of the village.It is hoped   
that this policy will continue in the  
future.                                </content>
