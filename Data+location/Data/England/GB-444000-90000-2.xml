		<content> You can have a holiday in a horse     
 drawn caravan at Porchfield.Mr and Mrs
 Dore have been running the Wight      
 holiday caravans since 1981.They have 
 five horse drawn caravans and seven   
 cob horses to pull them.They have some
 other horses  and ponies for riding,  
 one New Forest pony called Sunny is 32
 years old.The caravans hold four      
 people and one horse pulls each one.  
 They cannot pull the caravans up steep
 hills so they travel out towards      
 Newtown,Shalfleet,Yarmouth,and        
 Freshwater where the roads are flater.
 There have been two accidents with the
 caravans,one when a lorry crashed into
 the caravan and another when some cows
 kicked the caravans.
