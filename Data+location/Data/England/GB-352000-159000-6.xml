		<title>06The Quarry Hay in Chew Stoke</title>
		<content>{"Quarry Hay"}is in Chew Stoke opposite
 Brian's Garage. In the early morning  
 the milkman comes clattering his      
 bottles. About seven in the morning my
 next door neighbour's children get up 
 and start shouting and yelling. They  
 are only young, so I don't blame them.
 I get up about half eight and I always
 go on my bike first, I go for a ride  
 around the village and come back to   
 little children running around on     
 "Quarry Hay". I hardly go out in the  
 morning because I do my homework. At  
 about ten o'clock I go out on{"the    
{Hay"}as we used to call it. I muck    
 around with my tennis ball and when I 
 am tired I go in for lunch. The Hay   
 goes all quiet at lunch time.         
   In the Afternoon I go out on my bike
 with my mate Kev. I don't know what   
 goes on in Quarry Hay at night because
 I don't go out.                       </content>
