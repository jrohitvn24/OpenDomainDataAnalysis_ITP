		<title>17 Billen's Nursery;Wellow</title>
		<content>In Wellow there are five nurseries.We  
chose Mr.Billen's nursery in Plaitford.
To grow his products,shrubs,and        
climbing plants,acid type forest soil  
is used.The equipment consists of      
glasshouses,machinery and irrigation   
equipment.The Common Market does not   
affect the choice of product or income.
The fertilizers used are sometimes     
chemical and sometimes organic.The over
all production is whole sale, not      
retail, and is sold to the public and  
also garden centres.Twenty people are  
employed here,ten full time and ten    
part time.Pay varies from  125 to      
255 pence per hour according to        
experience for part time. They         
work from 8.00a.m to 1.00p.m.,cutting  
and potting plants,whereas a full time 
worker would also care for and         
maintain the plants. He receives       
around 300 pence per hour. By J.Welsh. </content>
