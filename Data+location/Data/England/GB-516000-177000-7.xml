		<title>07BRENTFORD HIGH STREET</title>
		<content> The main street runs between an old   
 area of late Victorian housing to the 
 North and industry to the South.The   
 High Street is dominated by the       
 Magistrate's Court which reflects     
 Brentford's function as a county town.
                                       
 There are numerous public houses,     
 including the Beehive, which has a    
 model of a beehive on its roof.       
                                       
 The largest shops are Goddard's       
 (furniture and romoval) and the newly 
 built International supermarket.      
                                       
                                       
 The other shops are smaller and are   
 mainly food shops. There are several  
 which have recently closed and are for
 sale.
