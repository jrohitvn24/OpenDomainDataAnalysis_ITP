		<content>      BEFORE,DURING AND AFTER THE      
 REFORMATION THE POPULATION ROUND HERE 
 WAS MOSTLY CATHOLIC.IN 1590 THE       
 SECRETARY OF STATE,LORD BURGHLEY,HAD A
 MAP OF LANCASHIRE DRAWN,LISTING 30    
 LOCAL GENTRY WHO NEEDED CAREFUL       
 WATCHING.THIS 'VIEW' HAD A CROSS BY   
 THE NAME OF THE BROCKHOLES OF         
 CLAUGHTON.NEXT YEAR THEY MOVED THEIR  
 PRIVATE CHAPEL FROM THEIR HALL TO A   
 SMALLER HOUSE NEAR BY CALLED DUCKWORTH
 HALL.IN AN UPSTAIRS ROOM,OPENING FROM 
 THE SIDE OF A CUPBOARD,IS A PRIEST'S  
 HOLE - A LONG NARROW SPACE BETWEEN TWO
 CHIMNEY STACKS.IT CONTAINS A WOODEN   
 SEAT AND TWO SHELVES AND, AT THE TIME 
 THAT IT WAS BUILT, WAS WINDOWLESS AND 
 WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO DETECT.IT
 SHOWS THE PRECAUTIONS THOUGHT         
 NECESSARY AT THAT TIME TO PROTECT A   
 PRIEST IN A SMALL HOUSE IN A REMOTE   
 COUNTRY AREA.                         </content>
