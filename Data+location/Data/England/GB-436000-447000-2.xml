		<title>02A WETHERBY CHILD'S LEISURE</title>
		<content> "I draw animals from books or some    
 times out of my head, but now and     
 again I draw my dog (if she will stay 
 still). I also read a lot. I read     
 factual books, such as the Guinness   
 Book of Records, which I enjoy reading
 very much. I like making things from  
 wood. Sometimes I sit down hammering  
 away and don't stop for 2-3 hours!    
 I attempt to make shelves or nests for
 animals but they always end up in a   
 heap of nails and wood. Despite all of
 these I also watch a lot of           
 television."                          
                                       
 Of all the leisure activities that    
 were mentioned, in the junior school's
 survey, watching television was the   
 most popular. Other activities        
 included 'messing about' in the       
 streets and ridihg bicycles,          
 especially the now popular BMX type.  </content>
