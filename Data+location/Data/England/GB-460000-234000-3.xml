		<content> In 1931 the lord of the manor,Sir     
 Samuuel Scott,M.P.for Marylebone      
 from 1898 till 1922, sold the estate  
 of 1328 acres and almost the whole    
 village.Only the church,the vicarage  
 and the Reindeer Inn were not included
 in the auction.There were 6 farms at  
 that time rented from the Scotts by   
 tenant farmers.The Chapman family were
 involved in most of them as well as   
 the Mill from the mid 19th century    
 till 1922 when the Owens entered the  
 scene.Some of the estate workers left 
 with the Scotts but those who stayed  
 were able to buy their homes and their
 descendents form the nucleus of the   
 village today.There is considerable   
 longeavity in Westbury so that it is  
 possible to talk to inhabitants who   
 spent their childhood in manorial days
 and whose parents worked for the lord 
 of the manor.                         </content>
