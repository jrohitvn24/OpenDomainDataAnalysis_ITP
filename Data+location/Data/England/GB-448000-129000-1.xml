		<content> The six square kilometres covered by  
 Class 5 at Winnall County Primary     
 School include a wide variety of land 
 uses and amenities . In the south     
 western corner is the heart of        
 Winchester with the Cathedral and     
 shopping centre . The residential     
 areas to the North and East surround  
 St.Giles Hill,  which overlooks       
 Winchester and from which it is       
 possible to see the remaining parts of
 the area . Below in the Itchen Valley 
 is the Winnall  Industrial Estate     
 which provides local employment and   
 which is alongside the newly extended 
 M3 which will join London and         
 Southampton in 1988. Beside the       
 factories flows the River Itchen which
 separates the industry from Winnall   
 Moors which is an S.S.S.I. Beyond the 
 Moors the land rises towards          
 Headbourne Worthy and Easton Down.    </content>
