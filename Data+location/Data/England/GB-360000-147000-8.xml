		<content> Many of the houses in our area date   
 from 1-2 hundred years ago when the   
 villages were at their most prosperous
 with quarries, the brewery and the    
 coal mines. With the decline of these 
 many fell into disrepair. However with
 improved transport from cars, many    
 people now chose to live in the       
 villages and there has been a large   
 amount of new, high quality building  
 in the last 30 years, while older     
 properties have been renovated. Most  
 old buildings are of local grey       
 limestone, sometimes dressed but often
 random rubble. Roofs are of red  clay 
 pantiles. Modern buildings are nearly 
 all infills between older buildings.  
 Each village has one council estate   
 all built prior to 1950. 4 large      
 country houses remain in Oakhill and  
 Ashwick, 2 are private houses, 1 a    
 museum and the last a restaurant.     </content>
