		<title>02PARK FARM</title>
		<content>   Between 1924 and 1956 Park Farm     
 Preserves Ltd. was a busy jam and     
 canning factory. The produce for      
 preserving came from all over the     
 country e.g. rhubarb from Manchester  
 and carrots from Ely. Blackcurrants   
 were made into puree for Ribena.      
   The sugar for all the preserves came
 from Tate &amp; Lyle in Bishops Cleeve (  
 where Santa Fe have their depot today)
 in 2 cwt. sacks.                      
   In the summer between 60 and 70     
 people were employed dropping to 15 - 
 20 in the winter. The jams and canned 
 foods were sent all over the country  
 and some were exported.               
   The factory closed in 1956 and      
 became a pig farm.                    
   This information was given by Mr. F.
 Clayton of Gretton who worked at the  
 factory.
