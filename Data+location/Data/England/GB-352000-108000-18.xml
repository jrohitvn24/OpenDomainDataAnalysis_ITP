		<title>18St Juthware</title>
		<content> A small new housing development along 
 the Yeovil road in Halstock is called 
 St Juthware's Close - and the pub     
 is The Quiet Woman, the sign showing a
 headless lady serenely carrying her   
 head under her arm. Enquiries produced
 this story: The name Halstock         
 signifies Holy Place and there used to
 be a shrine here which attracted      
 pilgrims. In the 7th century, a young 
 woman called Juthware living up       
 towards Abbots Hill, befriended these 
 travellers to the annoyance of her    
 stepmother and half brother. The      
 latter eventually became so incensed  
 that he cut off her head with his     
 sword. He was dismayed when she picked
 up the head, walked down to the       
 village, and laid it on the alter in  
 the church, before lying down to die. 
 Her ghost is said to re-enact this on 
 the anniversary of her death.         </content>
