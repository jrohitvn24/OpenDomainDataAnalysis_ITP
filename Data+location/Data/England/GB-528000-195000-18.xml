		<content>  When my mum wakes me up I get up.This
 is normally around 7:30am.I get       
 dressed immediately and when it's my  
 turn in the bathroom I go in ,to      
 wash.We work on a rota system.On      
 school days I wear my school uniform  
 but normally it is jeans and a T.shirt
 or jumper.I go downstairs to eat my   
 breakfast which is normally cereal and
 sometimes a grapefruit.Then I make my 
 packed lunch if it is a school day,and
 pack my bag.I leave for school at     
 about 8:30am.At school the first      
 lesson is normally maths or English   
 except on Mondays and Wednesdays when 
 we have silent reading.Our first break
 is at 10:30am and we have lunch at    
 12:00.We have Physical Education twice
 a week and art once.We have the       
 computer once a week with eductional  
 games.Our last break is at 2:30pm and 
 we go home at quarter to four.        </content>
