		<title>04Sheepdog trial</title>
		<content> On the{15th June}we had a sheepdog    
 trial at{Maplehurst Farm}to raise     
 money                                 
 for our school.We had 44 entrants and 
 their dogs. Most of the handlers ran  
 2 or more dogs. There were some{stalls
 like pottery  and spining also some of
 the children from the school did      
{country dancing.}At lunchtime you     
 could have roast lamb to eat.When you 
 got on to the course you had 15       
 minutes to round the sheep up.Someone 
 from the farm brought a{llama}round so
 that people could guess the name of   
 it.If you won you had a cake.On the   
 night some people had to sleep in a   
 caravan to look after the food and    
 drink and they had to light the fire. 
 The{person who won}was called         
 C.Winteron and his dog was called     
 Dylan. We raised{Â£1OOO}that will go to
 the{school.                           </content>
