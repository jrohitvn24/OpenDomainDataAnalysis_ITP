		<title>01Summary of Donisthorpe Area.</title>
		<content>                                       
 The area around Donisthorpe consists  
 mainly of farmland although there are 
 several small villages too. The area  
 we have to cover includes Acresford,  
 Netherseal,the south end of Overseal  
 and Donisthorpe.There are several     
 farms spread about the area.Across our
 block runs the route of the old Ashby 
 Canal,also a disused railway track.The
 houses in our area are made of brick  
 due to the availability of raw        
 materials which are needed at the     
 nearby brick factory. There are coal  
 mines in the area which unite the     
 villages into a mining community.These
 mines employ a high percentage of the 
 males.There are many clubs and social 
 activities organized which provide    
 entertainment for all ages.
