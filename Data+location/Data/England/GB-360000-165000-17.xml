		<title>17An Old Hedgerow</title>
		<content> In the grounds of Bridge Farm School  
 is an old hedegrow.It separates the   
 school orchard,which was retained when
 the estate was developed,from the     
 playing field.It runs north to south  
 and has a disused ditch on the west   
 side.It is approximately 146m long and
 on average 2.64m wide and 5.6m high.No
 management has occurred for at least  
 15 years and many trees have become   
 established,the tallest being a 6.5m  
 elm.The hedgerow is approximately 800 
 years old on the basis of 1 species   
 per 100 years.These are:elm,hawthorn, 
 blackthorn,field maple,dogwood,elder, 
 privet and wild rose,with the first   
 two being dominant.                   
 Several types of climbing plant       
 scramble up the hedge and many wild   
 flowers grow in it.It provides food   
 and shelter for various species of    
 birds,insects and small animals.      </content>
