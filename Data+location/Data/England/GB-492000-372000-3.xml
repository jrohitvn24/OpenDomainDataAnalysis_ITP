		<title>03Skellingthorpe Village</title>
		<content> Skellingthorpe Village dates back many
 centuries but today there are more    
 modern houses. St Lawrences School,   
 the Stones Public house and the Church
 are three of the oldest buildings but 
 there are lots of old cottages and an 
 old Village hall built in 1828. All   
 of these are still in use today. The  
 hall is used for all sorts of clubs   
 including Scouts, Guides and a thrift 
 shop.                                 
 There are a lot of farms in and around
 Skellingthorpe including Manor and    
 Holmes Farms.                         
 Nurses Lane is mainly modern houses   
 while there are some old peoples      
 bungalows on Hodsons Close.           
 There is a very interesting post box  
 in the village which still bears the  
 initials of King George the Sixth.
