		<title>10A Day In My Life</title>
		<content>   I wake up and go into the bathroom  
   and wash my face and clean my       
   teeth.                              
   I go back into my bedroom and get   
   dressed.                            
   I get on my shoes and go downstairs.
   I have my breakfast, then I  have my
   hair brushed.I get on the bus and go
   to school.                          
   We go in and have assembly.         
   In   the classroom we have Maths for
   an hour.Then we have play, then we  
   do English.We have dinner a while   
   later. We all have a long dinner    
   play. When we go in we do our topic 
   groups until last play,when we do   
   our unfinished work.After a while we
  go on the bus home.                  
  When I get home I get changed,watch  
  television, have tea and get into    
 bed.
