		<content> Working with a sample of eight and    
 nine year olds, only half knew they   
 had been Christened, 60% had attended 
 a Sunday School but only 25% continued
 to attend.   15% of mothers attended a
 church but only 7% of fathers, so     
 parental influence is small.   The    
 conflict between a belief in God,     
 which requires attending a place of   
 worship, and the idea that Sunday is a
 day of rest and recreation, results in
 parents withdrawing those children who
 originally enrolled at a Sunday School
 (10%).   The school assemblies, with  
 communal singing and worship, were    
 enjoyed by 95% of the sample and      
 schools are the only source of        
 spiritual experience for half their   
 pupils.   Despite lack of parental    
 commitment, 75% of the sample thought 
 that places of Christian worship would
 be needed in the future.              </content>
