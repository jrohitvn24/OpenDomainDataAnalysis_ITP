		<content> A SMALL RURAL VILLAGE SEVEN  MILES    
 SOUTH-EAST OF GRANTHAM ON THE GENTLY  
 UNDULATING LIMESTONE OF THE KESTEVEN  
 PLATEAU. IT IS MAINLY A DORMITORY     
 VILLAGE FOR THE TOWNS OF GRANTHAM AND 
 STAMFORD NOW THAT AGRICULTURE IS THE  
 ONLY OCCUPATION IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA.
 MIXED FARMING IS FOUND CLOSE TO THE   
 VILLAGE BUT CEREALS PREDOMINATE IN THE
 BLOCK AS A WHOLE. SCATTERED SMALL     
 WOODLAND AREAS ARE ANOTHER FEATURE OF 
 THE BLOCK. THE SMALL NORMAN MANOR     
 HOUSE IS THE BEST EXAMPLE IN THE      
 COUNTRY AND IS THE MOST IMPORTANT     
 HISTORICAL FEATURE. THE MANY DIFFERENT
 AGES OF THE HOUSES FROM TUDOR TO      
 TWENTIETH CENTURY REFLECT A QUIET     
 VILLAGE THAT HAS ADAPTED AND CONTINUED
 FROM DOMESDAY,1086,TO DOMESDAY,1986.
