 We went out on Thursday 6th June 1985 
 on our Domesday Project to interview  
 people about their jobs.Some people   
 worked from 2-7 days a week.Most      
 people would like more pay for less   
 hours."Better conditions", said a     
 carpenter, and the bus driver we      
 interviewed would like better coaches 
 to drive.At the Courtfield Arms,a pub 
 in Lower Lydbrook ,we interviewed the 
 accountant who seemed quite happy with
 her job,apart from wishing for more   
  pay.Most people worked on an average 
 of 9 hours a day and 6-7 day week. Not
 very many people had fringe benefits. 
 Most people worked on the premises and
 walked to work.For most people it     
 takes 10-15 minutes to get to work.
