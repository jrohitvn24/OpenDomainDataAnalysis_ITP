		<title>17VICARAGE FARM</title>
		<content> Vicarage Farm, built in the early     
 1800s, is an arable farm. It has an   
 area of 730 acres. It grows sugarbeet,
 potatoes, barley and wheat. On        
 Thursday July 11th., 1985, a new      
 sugarbeet harvester arrived, adding to
 the existing number of machines. It   
 cost 69,000 pounds. Vicarage Farm has 
 a grain store which can hold up to 850
 tons of wheat. The grain is put to dry
 leaving only 16% of water in it or it 
 will rot and then it cannot be sold.  
 Some of the grain is used as feed for 
 animals. On the farm is a water bore  
 hole which is used for pumping water  
 to the fields. It is used in          
 irrigating the land. Most farmers need
 to have a form of irrigation to keep  
 the crops watered as the weather is   
 unreliable. Mr. Plant is the Farm     
 Manager and it is owned by W.B.       
 Chambers.                             </content>
