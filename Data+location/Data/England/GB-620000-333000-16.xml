		<title>16Transport Around Gunton</title>
		<content> Trains run daily from Gunton station, 
2 miles distant and originally built   
for visitors to Gunton Hall. There are 
connections to the Midlands and London 
at Norwich.                            
 Eastern Counties Omnibus Co. runs an  
hourly service to Norwich and Cromer in
summer, but less frequently in the     
winter. It is heavily subsidised as it 
is under used.                         
 Aldborough Community Bus Company but  
driven voluntarily carries 16          
passengers. It runs twice weekly to    
north Walsham for shopping. Occasional 
excursions are arraged to Norwich for  
shopping and the theatre as the times  
of the regular company services are    
inconvenient. Most households own a car
which is used for local and supermarket
shopping,social outings,holidays and   
visitings.
