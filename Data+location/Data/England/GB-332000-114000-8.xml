		<content> At school we play football on the     
 field and Hide and Seek but on wet    
 days  we  go on  to the playground    
 and play line Catch, catch, Hop Scoth,
 Pac man and Army games. The main game 
 boys play is  football. Some of the   
 girls   play football but not many.   
 The rules of our school football are  
 that each team  has 6 or 11 players.  
 The main aim is to score goals (to get
 the ball into the other teams net) it 
 must be passed to  the other  players 
 or dribbled and taken by one person.  
       If  you unfairly tackle a player
 of the other team it is called a      
 "foul" and they have a free kick, or a
 penalty when they can try for a goal  
 with only the goalkeeper to beat.     
 The game is controlled by a referee.
