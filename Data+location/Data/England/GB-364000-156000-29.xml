Out of the 33 people we asked, 22 of them didn't go to any sport clubs although 9 went to one sport club, and one person went to three. We also found out that one person went to four sport clubs.&lt;br />&lt;br />We found out that the most popular TV programme was East Enders and Sport. The least popular is The Apprentice, The Olympics, Animals, Lose Women, Quiz, Science, Deadliest catch, Spooks, Thrillers and Come Dine With Me.&lt;br />&lt;br />We discovered that 21 people did watch sport but we were surprised that 12 people didn't.  So, it seems that most people like watching sport and we are very surprised by this.  We would have thought that everyone would have love watching sport!&lt;br />&lt;br /> The most popular hobby was reading which we found a surprise. Other hobbies in our survey included horse riding, camping, mountain climbing, cooking, shopping, fishing, computers, snooker, going out with friends, roller skating, watching sport, choir and bowls.   &lt;br />
