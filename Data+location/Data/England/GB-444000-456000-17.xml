		<title>17GREEN HAMMERTON SCHOOL.</title>
		<content> Our school was built in l874. It is   
 made of brick with stone facings.     
 There is a steep pitched roof and     
 porch with tiles. Once there was just 
 one room with a fire. You can still   
 see the chimney, the open beams and   
 the pretty bell tower with tall slim  
 spire which once had a weathervane    
 that worked but now it is stuck.  The 
 spire can be seen from far away. There
 is also now another modern classroom  
 added after the war where the infants 
 live, and a double temporary unit     
 which we use as a hall but once there 
 were two more classes in there. We    
 also have a lovely big field to play  
 football and dens. On the other side  
 of the main building is a playground  
 with netball posts and bars to play   
 on and a sandpit where the infants    
 play at being engineers, tunnelling   
 and digging. There are 27 children.   </content>
