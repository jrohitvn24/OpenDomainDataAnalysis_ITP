		<title>03The Drayton Chronicle</title>
		<content> The Drayton Amenities Society produces
 a monthly local newspaper, the Drayton
 Chronicle. It is not an ordinary      
 village newsheet but a twelve page    
 professional style publication printed
 in Oxford.  The Chronicle, is produced
 and distributed by a voluntary team   
 of about sixty villagers.  875 copies 
 are now distributed each month. It    
 began in 1978 and costs about Â£1500   
 a year to produce. The costs are met  
 mainly from a local lottery, tickets  
 being sold by the Chronicle           
 distributors.  Each month about 1500  
 10p tickets are sold and Â£50 is given 
 out in cash prizes. The remaining     
 costs of production are met from local
 business advertising. The Chronicle   
 includes coverage of local events,    
 notes on clubs and societies, parish  
 information, a countryman's diary and 
 a letters page.                       </content>
