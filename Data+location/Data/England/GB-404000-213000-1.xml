		<title>01THE SCENERY  AROUND YANWORTH</title>
		<content>     This is{a very pretty  area of the
{Cotswolds} and  is  described in  many
 guide books.  Several{public footpaths
 conveniently  cross this area and link
 the{famous Roman Villa  near Chedworth
 with{Yanworth}and its{Norman church.  
     From the  high  plateau  there are
{extensive  views}  of  the   intensive
 arable  farming,  the  large  area  of
 deciduous  woodland  and  the   pretty
 valley  of the  Coln,  starting on its
 journey to join the Thames. The narrow
 winding  lanes  descend  between  high
 banks and hedges   through steep sided
 valleys leading to the Coln.  The main
 settlement at{Yanworth}is sited on the
 south and sunny side of the plateau.  
     With  almost no  modern buildings,
 virtually no commuters,  no industrial
 development and no tourist facilities,
{around  Yanworth  there is an unspoilt
{rural but working Cotswold landscape. </content>
