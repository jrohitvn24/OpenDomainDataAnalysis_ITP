		<title>12THE PLAYING FIELDS(CONT)</title>
		<content>  At the beginning the Bridge Field was
 just that, just a field and it was    
 used by the farmer to keep his cows   
 in.There was a small football field   
 used by the{Grindleford juniors}but   
 apart from that it was just a{meadow. 
 They organised the committee by       
 holding a public meeting in the chapel
 school room and all the village were  
 asked to attend.A lot of people       
 turned up for that firsted meeting in 
 1976  and mr robert crossland was     
 elected{chairman}and then we had to   
 decide who was going to be on the     
 committee this was very difficult     
 because there were so many people     
 interested in developing a playing    
 field for Grindleford eventully,we    
 decided that we were going to have a  
 committee of 12 and these were alected
 from all those present.
