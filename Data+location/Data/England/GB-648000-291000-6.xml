I get up around 8.00 oclock in the     
morning.Then I get ready and           
have breakfast which varies from day to
day.Then I wash.Then I set off to      
school,and get there about 9.00        
oclock.  when I get to cIass we all go 
to practical with Mr Hills. I like     
pottery as I make things out of clay.  
We have French next, followed by       
Humanities and then Assembly. Then I   
go to class, get maths and go home. I  
have tea and go out to  with my brother
over to the Denes High School's        
playing field. We push the goal posts  
over, turn them upside down to play    
see-saw with the posts. Then my brother
kisses his girl friend and we get onto 
our bicycles to go home.
