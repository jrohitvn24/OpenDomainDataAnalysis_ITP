		<title>13MARCONI UNDERWATER SYSTEMS</title>
		<content>  After initial problems with a "Peace 
 Camp" which objected to the building  
 of a factory involved in the          
 manufacture of armaments the buildings
 on the site were completed in April   
 1985 and covers about 13 acres.  They 
 employ about 1200 men and 300 women   
 and,because of their specialists      
 trades(electrical engineering) were   
 not recruited locally but brought in  
 to the area. The skills required in   
 the engineering field accounts for the
 fact that more men are employed than  
 women.  Marconi's do not actually     
 manufacture anything they are purely a
 research and development "Think Tank".
 Leisure facilities include a dance and
 disco hall, table tennis,judo and keep
 fit areas as well as a bar.  An       
 underground stream runs through the   
 site which limits the size and weight 
 of vehicles which can enter the site. </content>
