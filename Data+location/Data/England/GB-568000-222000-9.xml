		<title>09  POUND FARMHOUSE</title>
		<content>   Pound Farmhouse is no longer a      
 working farm.Its land was sold to a   
 neighbouring farm by 1927. The house  
 was built in the 1500s. It is a timber
 framed building with lath  and plaster
 between the beams. In the middle ages 
 lost animals were brought here to     
 graze and drink from  the pond, that  
 is how the house got its name Pound   
 Farmhouse. Rayne mill used to stand by
 the river close to Pound Farmhouse.   
   The mill was built in the 1700s and 
 was mostly used as a grain mill. But  
 in the early 1900s the river dried up 
 so it was no longer used. It was      
 pulled down in 1908.                  
   Mrs Sweetenham now lives at Pound   
 Farmhouse with her husband. They have 
 lived there for 16 years. They have   
 a big garden with a pond and a paddock
 across the road.
