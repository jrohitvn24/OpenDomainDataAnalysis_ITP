 The acreage of hops is being reduced, 
 reflecting the present lack of        
 confidence in the crop. Economic      
 problems and factors in the brewing   
 industry may see the acreage decline  
 further. Conversely the acreage of    
 wheat and barley has increased, the   
 protection afforded by the European   
 Economic Community making them        
 profitable crops. Some straw is       
 harvested and some is burned in situ  
 on the fields. Straw burning,         
 practised by many farmers, is an      
 emotive issue with people. Livestock  
 farming, mainly cattle and sheep, is  
 secondary to other agricultural       
 activities. Market gardening is       
 practised at Kenward, Yalding and     
 Green Farm, Nettlestead. The vineyard 
 at Nettlestead Green is neglected and 
 no longer in production.              </content>
