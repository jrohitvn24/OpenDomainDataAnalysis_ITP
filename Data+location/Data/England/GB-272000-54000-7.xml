		<content> Our area is a good place for tourists.
 To the south lie many sandy {beaches},
 very popular during the summer.  To   
 the North the  Dartmoor  National{Park
 365 square miles of rugged beauty. So 
 members of the Caravan Club will      
 probably enjoy this area for its peace
 and quiet.  There are two caravn sites
 locally. We also have Bed nd Breakfast
 in many houses and farms. There are a 
 lot of Public Footpaths and there is  
 the {river} Avon which you are able to
 fish for trout and sometimes salmon.  
 The Avon is calm and quiet. Many      
 tourists journey through our lanes and
 colourful hedgerows seeking tourist   
 attractions.
