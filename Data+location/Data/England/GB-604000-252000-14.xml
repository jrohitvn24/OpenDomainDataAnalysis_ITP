There are four churches within this    
area, St. Mary's Barking, St.          
Catherine's Ringshall, St. Mary's      
Battisford, and the Free Church,       
Barking.                               
                                       
St. Mary's Barking: There has been a   
church on this site since Saxon times. 
About 1250 a flint rubble building was 
erected, of which the vestry, chancel, 
and parts of the tower and nave still  
stand. From 1350 over a period of 200  
years, the church was enlarged, and is 
now over-large for the small village it
now serves. Until 1901 it was the      
mother church of Needham Market, during
which time the coffins would be carried
on foot along the Causeway or          
Corpseway.                             
                                       
                                       </content>
