		<title>06ECCLESFIELD CHURCH</title>
		<content> Ecclesfield Church is about 1500 years
 old.It is situated on a hill and can  
 be seen from a great distance in some 
 directions .It was built of stone by  
 the monks of St.Wandrille's Abbey in  
 Normandy.The massive tower was        
 erected in the 15th century.Dodsworth 
 wrote in 1620"the church is           
 called(andthat deservedly)by the      
 village,the 'Mynster of the           
 Moors'beign the fairesr church for    
 stone wood and glass that ever I came 
 in of a country                       
 church."Unfortunatley,the stained     
 glass windows were smashed by the     
 puritans in the time of Oliver        
 Cromwell .The few remaining fragments 
 of mediaeval glass are now in a window
 in the north transept.The oldest thing
 in the church is an anglo saxon       
 cross,it stands near to the door in   
 the south transept.                   </content>
