		<content> Fred Hill remembers the Peak Forest   
 Tramway working between Dove Holes &amp;  
 Buxworth.It carried limestone to the  
 canal basin.Fred's father was a       
 chauffeur at Bibbington Hall &amp; drove  
 the first car in Dove holes in l910   
 (a Singer).He also remembers Louis    
 Bleriot giving a demonstation flight  
 over Fairfield Common.                
 Mr Cottrill's family have been in the 
 village for 200 years as joiners,     
 builders &amp; funeral directors. He      
 remembers gas light coming to the     
 village.Mugs were given out at school 
 for the Silver Jubilee of King George 
 V &amp; all the children had to wear black
 armbands when he died.Three large     
 quarries worked in the village making 
 it a busy place (and dusty).All the   
 work was done by hand even the pushing
 of the laden wagons.
