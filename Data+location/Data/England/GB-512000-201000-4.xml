		<content>Both Bricket Wood and How Wood have    
only small parades of shops, where you 
can buy the basic necessities.But in a 
village, it means that the shopkeepers 
get to know you, and they are really   
friendly.In Bricket Wood, the parade of
shops in Oakwood Road has an Off       
Licence,a small supermarket, a         
newsagents (also selling sweets and    
tobacco and stationery),a chemists,a   
greengrocer,and a butcher's.Mr.Brooks  
owns the butcher's and he runs it with 
his son and two other men.You always   
get a laugh there.                     
Watford is a good shopping centre, as  
there are lots of big stores.Lots of   
mums go to one of the big supermarkets 
like Sainsbury's, Tesco, or Waitrose in
the nearby towns.
