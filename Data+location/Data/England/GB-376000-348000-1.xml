		<title>01THE AREA OF AUDLEY HALMEREND</title>
		<content>The area covered by our grid squares is
mostly in the Parish of Audley.The area
to the extreme west is either in the   
parish of Betley or Barthomley.        
The area is mainly rural with most of  
the block covered by grassland for     
pasture/cutting or crops.Originally,   
some of the villages in the area were  
important mining communities but many  
pits have now closed.However,open cast 
mining is now growing in importance and
there are plans for further areas in   
the near future.Although this means    
more jobs most people now work in      
nearby Stoke,Crewe or Newcastle.       
Two villages are found in the area;    
Halmerend an old mining village and    
Audley the main shopping centre for the
parish.In 1860,the area was described  
as "an out of the way,quiet place" - to
some extent it has not changed!
