		<content> Soon we were back in country lanes to 
 Staverton village        and yet it is
 so near the town. There were many very
 old buildings especially farms and    
 churches. We will visit a few later.  
 Then on to the hamlet of Barrow. We   
 would like to have gone on to         
 Uckington but this was on a very busy 
 road and we thought it would not be   
 safe to have so many cyclists on such 
 a main road. We had met quite a bit of
 traffic even on the country roads we  
 went on but the drivers were very     
 considerate and gave us plenty of     
 room. Our route covered some 12kms and
 we went through beautiful countryside 
 with plenty of birds and butterflies. 
 We passed many farms but we also saw  
 the Dowty factories, the motor way,   
 hotels, caravan sites, Hayden Sewage  
 Farm, Park Nurseries and homes. These 
 we would all look at closer.          </content>
