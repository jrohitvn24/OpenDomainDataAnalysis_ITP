		<title>15HARMONDSWORTH VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Harmondsworth village is situated to  
 the south of West Drayton. It is a    
 conservation area and as a result has 
 managed to keep its village           
 atmosphere. This is partly because    
 many old victorian houses still       
 remain. It has two churches, St.Mary's
 and a Baptist church, a village green,
 two pubs and a school. One of the     
 oldest buildings is the Tithe Barn in 
 a field next to the church. It was    
 built in the 14th or 15th century and 
 is 191 feet long and 38 feet wide.    
 Near Hatch Lane junction one can see  
 what were once old farm cottages.     
 These were used in the Second World   
 War to house Italian prisoners.
