		<content> drink. At 4.00PM there was the        
 tug_of_war between two teams which    
 were the Village verses the Greyhound 
 Public house. The Village won by two  
 points to one. At 4.15 there was a    
 dancing display in the Village Hall.  
 The dancing display was very good. At 
 5.00 the raffles were drawn and the   
 fete closed. It was a very enjoyable  
 day and we raised alot of money.
