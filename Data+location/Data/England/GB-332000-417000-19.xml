		<content>{On Friday, 21st June Nurse Donnelly   
 came to talk to 1A.Nurse Donnelly     
 studied for three years to become an  
 S.E.N. She works at a Psycho Geriatric
 Nursing Home in Oxford Road,Southport.
 Her working day is from 8am to 4pm,   
 Monday to Friday.Occasionally she does
 shift work.She has worked in various  
 hospitals in Liverpool and Southport, 
 including the Southport Infirmary and 
 the Promenade Hospital.She has worked 
 as theatre nurse and has seen a lot of
 operations including amputation,      
 cardiac and eye operations,the last of
 which she hates.Nurse Donnelly doesn't
 mind blood but she hates vomit.       
    In her opinion,nurses are underpaid
 for the work they do.Nurse Donnelly   
 says she enjoys nursing but often     
 finds it tiring and sometimes         
 depressing.She says the best part of  
 nursing is seeing people get better.  </content>
