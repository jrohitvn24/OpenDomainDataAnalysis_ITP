		<content> The block is mainly arable farm land  
 plus the main population centres of   
 the villages of Badingham &amp;           
 Dennington,about 200 houses in all.In 
 l98l populations were Badingham       
 378,Dennington 433,an apparent 7%     
 decline since l97l probably due to    
 increased armed forces intake not     
 included in census. Many new houses   
 have been built recently.             
 Dennington is a relatively compact    
 village with a primary school, public 
 bus service &amp; playing field.Badingham 
 is scattered and has none of these    
 amenities.In other respects the       
 villages are similar except that      
 Dennington has more local authority   
 housing. Omitting USAF occupants,l89  
 questionnaires were distributed to    
 households &amp; ll8 replies comprising   
 323 individuals received (62%). The   
 following pages analyse these replies.</content>
