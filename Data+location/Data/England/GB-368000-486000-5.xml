		<content>   The school has no uniform and very  
 few rules,the main rule is (NEVER RUN 
 INSIDE SCHOOL),this helps prevent     
 accidents;the other rule is(DON'T     
 SWEAR),anyone who forgets this has a  
 hundred lines or more to write out.   
    Teachers make education interesting
 by taking pupils out of school to look
 at the local environment in order to  
 study wild flowers,insects,rocks,the  
 river and farming.                    
    Junior children have the chance of 
 visiting places such as London,       
 Edinburgh,Wales,Chester and so on,    
 staying away from home for three or   
 four  nights at a time.Day trips are  
 organised to places like Bradford,    
 Lancaster,Morcambe and Kendal.        
     We perform pantomimes and         
 nativities at Christmas,take special  
 services in Church,welcome parents and
 visitors into our school.It's fun!    </content>
