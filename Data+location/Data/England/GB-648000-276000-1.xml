		<content>  Since 1921 the population of         
 Southwold has been steadily going     
 down:_   1921   {3370                 
          1931   {2753                 
          1941    no census because of 
 war, but population very low.         
          1951   {2473                 
          1961   {2234                 
          1971   {1998                 
          1981   {1795                 
  There are two main reasons for this  
 decline:{a)}The population has very   
 few young people, because of lack of  
 job opportunities; most people are old
 and of course have no children because
 of this;when the old people die, the  
 population goes down.                 
         {b)}Planning restrictions on  
 building on the common mean few new   
 houses; marshes and sea surround the  
 town so there is no room for          
 expansion.                            </content>
