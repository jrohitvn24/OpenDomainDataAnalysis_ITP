		<content>     Moorsholm welcomes the friendly   
 newcomers but respects those who do   
 not 'join in.'  The established       
 residents say 'Hello' to complete     
 strangers &amp; would be surprised not to 
 get a response.  Like a large family  
 there is a strong feeling of          
 belonging.  There are no extremes of  
 poverty or affluence. Vandalism is    
 virtually unknown. It is a village of 
 'Good neighbours.'                    
     First impressions are of the      
 cleanliness of the village, the lack  
 of traffic and the gentle pace of     
 life. On moving into the village,     
 newcomers are overwhelmed by the      
 friendliness and helpfulness of       
 residents, the closeness of village   
 life and the vast number of available 
 activities.  On the climatic side the 
 strength of the wind is an outstanding
 feature.                              </content>
