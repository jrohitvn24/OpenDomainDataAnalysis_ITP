		<title>19Buntingford-Luynes Twinning</title>
		<content>  Buntingford is "twinned" with the    
 French town of Luynes. One of the     
 advantages to the people of           
 Buntingford is that thet can stay free
 of charge at the "Camping" of Luynes! 
                                       
  There have several exchange visits   
 over the years, mostly between        
 children of secondary school age. In  
 the Spring of 1985 a group of         
 teenagers from Ward Freman High School
 cycled from Buntingford to Luynes,    
 bearing gifts produced locally. These 
 included art work with local subjects,
 produced at Edwinstree and Ward Freman
 schools.                              
                                       
  Plans are being made for more school 
 exchanges in the years to come.
