 there.  A  small village with one or  
 two outlying farms, Northorpe has 2   
 old stone farmhouses (Charity Farm-   
 house and 300 year old{Northorpe      
{Manor)}and several (renovated) stone  
 cottages. "Amaryllis" on the market at
 Â£38,000 has some herringbone brickwork

 were designed by Goldsmith and built  
 in the 1870s. Northorpe Hall stands in
 parkland and is close to the site of  
 the 16 C manor house.{(Old Hall)}In   
 1985 the house and 6.5 acres of land  
 fetched Â£108,000 at public auction:   
 the (Scotter) buyer plans to convert  
 the house to a restaurant. 7 listed   
 buildings are those marked above and
