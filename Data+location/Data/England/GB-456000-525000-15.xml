		<title>15Houses of Coatham High St.</title>
		<content> On High Street West there was once a  
 school but now it is a Training-      
 Centre. Most of the houses in High    
 Street West are terraced houses. The  
 reasons that most of them are terraced
 are that they save space and they are 
 cheaper to build. The oldest houses in
 High Sreet West are the ones that are 
 facing the sea. The oldest house in   
 High Street West is the Yeoman's      
 House. It was built in 1698. Above the
 door are the initials of the first    
 people who owned it. The initials are 
 G and I. On the north side of High    
 Street West there are a lot of        
 semi-detached houses which were not   
 built until the 1930's. Next to these 
 are some detached houses built much   
 later in the 1960's. The rest of the  
 north side is made up of terraces,    
 also built about the 1930s, which     
 includes The Cleveland Public House.  </content>
