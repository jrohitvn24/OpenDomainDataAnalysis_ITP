		<content> One of my favourite games is British  
 Bulldog. You draw two lines about four
 metres apart on some level ground.    
 Someone stands in the middle who is   
 on.The rest of the children stand     
 behind one of the lines and they have 
 to run to the other side without being
 tagged. The last one tagged is the    
 winner.                               
 Block is another one of my favourite  
 games.All you need is a lamp post for 
 a block.Some people run off and hide. 
 There is one person on who has to     
 count to one hundred.Then he looks for
 the ones who are hiding.If he sees    
 someone he runs to the block and      
 blocks the person he has seen.If      
 someone who is hiding gets to the     
 block before the person who is on and 
 shouts{"Cut!"}he is not on for the    
 next game.
