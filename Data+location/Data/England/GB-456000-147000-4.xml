		<content> The recent building of the{M3 Motorway
 with the local interchange, reduced   
 traffic on the other main highway in  
 the area, the{A30 Trunk Road.}Modern  
 vehicles have difficulty negotiating  
 the narrow{country lanes.}Minor roads 
 and cul de sacs in recently built     
 housing areas are frequently lined    
 with{parked cars.}Popular makes are:  
 Ford, Austin/Rover, Vauxhall, Volvo   
 and Volkswagen.{Bicycles}especially   
 "BMX's", are popular with children.   
 Few adults ride bicycles.             
                                       
 Numbered{footpaths}are becoming       
 increasingly used by ramblers and for 
 leisure activities such as family     
 walks, jogging and dog walking. The   
 latter is the cause of frequent       
 complaint due to the fouling of       
 footpaths.                            
                                       </content>
