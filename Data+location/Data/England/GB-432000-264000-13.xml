		<title>13HOUSING IN SOUTH LEAMINGTON.</title>
		<content>   In the square we surveyed (04320264)
 there were many roads containing a lot
 of houses.  We decided to count them. 
 Everytime we came to a house we       
 recorded it on our tally chart.       
   Altogether there were 45 streets in 
 our one square.  There were too many  
 houses for us to count alone, so we   
 all had three streets each.  When we  
 had finished counting the houses we   
 came up with these results. There were
 36 detached, 903 semi-detached, 665   
 terrace, 464 flats, 15 bungalows and 6
 maisonettes.                          
   Most of the semi- detatched were    
 built in the 1920's but the terraced  
 houses were older and were built in   
 Queen Victoria's reign. The total     
 number of homes in our square was     
 found to be 2091.  We didn't think    
 there would be quite as many as there 
 were.                                 </content>
