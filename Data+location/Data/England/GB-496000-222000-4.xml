		<content>  The Church of England churches of    
 Stanbridge and Tilsworth are          
 incoporated in the North Chilterns    
 Group of Parishes with Rev Canon Derek
 Cook as the incumbent. The Group      
 Council meets four times annually for 
 discussion.                           
  The church of St John the Baptist at 
 Stanbridge has been greatly restored  
 but contains an interesting inscribed 
 stone boulder found in 1858 and is    
 said to pre_date Christianity. An     
 Early English font standing on three  
 columns and some 17th Century woodwork
 make this an interesting church for   
 the visitor.                          
  At All Saints Tilsworth there is a   
 tombstone to the memory of an unknown 
 girl who was murdered in the woods    
 nearby.                               
  There are no chapels in either of    
 these villages.                       </content>
