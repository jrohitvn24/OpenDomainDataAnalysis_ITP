  The church is very old.The tower     
 dates back to the twelfth century.The 
 spire dates from the fifteenth        
 century.It was ,however, so heavy it  
 caused the tower to crack and two     
 supporting buttresses had to be built 
 in the nineteenth century.The         
 thirteenth century font is one of the 
 best examples in the county.It is     
 octagonal with decorated gables.
