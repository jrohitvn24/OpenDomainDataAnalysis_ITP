		<title>11RINGLEY BRIDGE AND STOCKS</title>
		<content>{RINGLEY BRIDGE}WAS BUILT IN{1677}AND  
 COST{Â£500}.IT WAS BUILT TO REPLACE A  
 WOODEN BRIDGE WHICH WAS WASHED AWAY IN
{1673}.WHILE THERE WAS NO BRIDGE,PEOPLE
 HAD TO CROSS THE{RIVER IRWELL}BY BOAT.
 THE BRIDGE WAS DECLARED AN{ANCIENT    
{MONUMENT}IN{1950}.                    
 IN{JUNE 1938}THE BRIDGE WAS CLOSED SO 
 THAT REPAIRS COULD BE MADE TO THE     
 SURFACE AT A COST OF{Â£30 000.}        
 THE COBBLES WERE TAKEN UP SO THAT A   
 LAYER OF WATERPROOFED CONCRETE COULD  
 BE LAID.THE WORK WAS DONE BY{GREATER  
{MANCHESTER COUNCIL}.                  
{STOCKS}                               
 BESIDE THE BRIDGE THERE ARE SOME      
 STOCKS WHICH PROBABLY DATE BACK FROM  
 THE{SEVENTEENTH}CENTURY,BUT NO RECORD 
 OF THE STOCKS REMAIN.
