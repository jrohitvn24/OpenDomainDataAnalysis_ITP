A chicken farm in Akeley has recently  
started up, giving employment to a few 
women who sort and pack these free-    
range eggs for sale to top London shops
such as Harrods.  Stowe Castle Farm is 
all grassland used for animal feed.    
This enables the farmer to take long   
holidays without worrying about his    
crop.  The main area left is cereal and
oil seed rape, about 20% purely for    
grazing.  Farmer's wives are all-      
important, they are up early preparing 
breakfast; their menfolk often come    
home for a cooked lunch with accompany-
ing muddy footwear.  Of course is they 
are large landowners they lead a very  
comfortable existence.
