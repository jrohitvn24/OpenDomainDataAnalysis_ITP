		<content>   Uckfield County Council have just   
 released proposed plans for a new     
 housing estate,a new school and       
 recreational facilities for the New   
 Town area of Uckfield in the          
 southeastern part of the town.This    
 draft plan puts forward proposals and 
 policies to guide and co_ordinate new 
 development and the use of land in the
 Uckfield area over the next ten years.
   Although these plans have just been 
 released and as yet are only proposals
 a lot of adverse public opinion is    
 already gathering. Of the people we   
 spoke to noone felt that the town of  
 Uckfield would benefit from the growth
 of its present population of 9800 to  
 over 13,000 by the end of the plan    
 period. This was despite the fact that
 industrial development and leisure    
 facilities etc. are also planned.
