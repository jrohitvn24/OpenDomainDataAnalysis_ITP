 went to visit Warsop-Stebbing cricket 
 bat makers. The company was started in
 1870 by Ben Warsop.They have a big    
 range of cricket bats.They also make  
 rounders bats,hockey sticks and padder
 tennis bats.The man that works there  
 has been working there for 38         
 years.The cricket bats are made of    
 willow.They get the willow from       
 farmers in Essex,Suffolk and          
 Surrey.The building they work in was  
 established in 1960.They work 9 hours 
 a day.The man said that it takes about
 45 minutes to make a size 6 cricket   
 bat.It costs about Â£14 to produce a   
 size 6 cricket bat.The man makes about
 30 cricket bats a day.There are 3     
 workers in the workshop.They sell     
 there cricket bats to Australia,The
