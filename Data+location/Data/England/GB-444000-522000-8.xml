		<content> We did a survey on the jobs which our 
 parents did and found out the         
 following facts:-                     
 The full time jobs were mainly taken  
 by dads with only 4% unemployed. Of   
 the mothers only 32%  were in full    
 time employment. 52% of mothers had   
 part time jobs however. The type of   
 jobs showed many varieties such as a  
 church minister, a baker, engineers,  
 lecturers, electricians etc. Only 9%  
 worked away from home and these       
 included a long distance lorry driver,
 a sea going engineer and an engineer  
 working in Holland.                   
 In the past many people lived in this 
 area to work at ICI in Billingham. In 
 fact on the Crooksbarn Estate there is
 a row of houses in which ICI managers 
 used to live, but on our survey only  
 8% worked for ICI.
