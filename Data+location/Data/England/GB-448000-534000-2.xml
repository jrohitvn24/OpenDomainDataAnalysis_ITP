		<title>02A DAY IN THE LIFE OF JOANNE.</title>
		<content> The first thing I do is go to the     
 toilet and swill my face with         
 water.I open my curtains and then get 
 my clothes out.When I am off          
 school I put my old playing out       
 trousers and jumpers on.Mam gives me  
 corn flake cereal for breakfast and   
 orange juice while I watch TV.I       
 put my shoes and coat on and go to    
 my nana's on the number 6 bus,she     
 lives near King Oswy shops.My cousin  
 Stephen was there.We looked for lady  
 birds I walked him round to the bus   
 stop with his mam.My fare home was    
 11p.Our tea was chops,chips,and       
 noodle doodles.Later my friends and   
 I went down Ann's shop.I got some     
 Coca Cola and then we played wall     
 ball and space invaders.I had toast   
 for supper and watched TV.It was      
 Coronation Street.My mam locked all   
 the doors and we went to bed.         </content>
