		<title>12Tescos</title>
		<content> It is possible to buy nearly          
 everything a family would need in the 
 store. There is a car park next to the
 store for customrs to use. We asked   
 fifty people who were entering the    
 store why they used Tescos and where  
 they came from. This is a summary of  
 their answers;42% came from           
 Trowbridge,12% from                   
 Bradford-on-Avon,12% from villages    
 which are within a two mile radius of 
 Trowbridge and the other 30% from no  
 further than 10 miles away. The       
 reasons that people gave for choosing 
 to shop at Tescos were very varied.   
 The most popular reason given was that
 it was convenient(one lady from       
 Warminster said this!)and that there  
 was a wide variety of goods all under 
 one roof.
