		<title>12PETERSFIELD INFANT SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Some builders have been building a new
 school for Petersfield Infants just   
 next to the old one. It is due to be  
 finished on l6th August, 1985. There  
 are going to be three classrooms      
 upstairs and three downstairs. My Mum,
 who teaches there, is going to have a 
 downstairs classroom.                 
 At first this was an all-age school   
 and later a Primary school. Since 1975
 when Herne Junior school was opened it
 has been an Infant school. There are  
 280 children on roll.                 
 The villages of Sheet, Steep and      
 Stroud each have their own Primary    
 schools.  Children from all these     
 schools go on to Petersfield          
 Comprehensive School when they are 11.
