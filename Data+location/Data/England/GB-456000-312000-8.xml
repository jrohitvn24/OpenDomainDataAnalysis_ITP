		<title>08RIDING FROM ROTHLEY</title>
		<content> Every Saturday at 3:00 p.m.I go to    
 have riding lessons.I go to Rempston  
 ,which is about 12 miles off, so we   
 leave at about 2.3O.I go with my      
 sister ,Sharon,and two friends Jane   
 and Charlotte.I used to go to a       
 riding school but they did not        
 really teach you much,except for your 
 jumping position,and how to make your 
 pony go,turn,and things like that.    
 Sometimes we did a bit of cantering,  
{ Rempston}is far better ,for they only
 ever allow 8 in a lesson,and our      
 lesson usually has 4 or 5.They teach  
 you exactly how to do things,         
 including how to lengthen or          
 shorten stirrups.This costs Â£3.5O.In  
 Rothley , the Livery Stables is       
 called{The Paddocks}.They have 11     
 stalls.They look after other peoples  
 horses which are exercised in pairs.
