		<content> My dad works for British Rail.He works
 at Meldon quarry which is near to     
 Okehampton.He gets up at 6.00 (a.m)   
 and  he leaves half an hour later.He  
 goes to the car park and gets his     
 van.On the way to work he picks up    
 some of his mates.When he gets to work
 he has breakfast.He then starts work. 
 He either uses the Plant Machine or   
 the crusher.These are used to crush   
 stone for the railway.                
   He gets back from work at about 4.30
 (p.m)When he gets back he is hot so   
 mum makes him a cup of tea.At tea     
 time he tells us what has happened    
 that day at work.
