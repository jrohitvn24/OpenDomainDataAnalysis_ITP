		<content>   Polegate Station was moved from its 
 original position to make possible the
 construction of the "Cuckoo Line" to  
 Tunbridge Wells. Now this line is     
 redundant, there are plans to move    
 the station back again.               
   The majority of shops are in the    
 newer areas: Polegate High Street,    
 Freshwater Square, Lower Willingdon   
 Triangle.                             
   Opposite Bank Cottages in Wish Hill,
 a village pump, erected 1880, has rows
 of sheep's bones in its surrounding   
 building.                             
   Two small hotels cater for visitors:
 Chalk Farm Hotel and Wannock Hotel.   
 The majority of visitors are hikers,  
 also foreign students who stay with   
 host families in the summer months.40%
 of 250 families surveyed had          
 accommodated them. Most came from     
 Scandinavia, France, Germany, Italy.  </content>
