		<title>11Abbotsley Sunday School</title>
		<content> Mrs.Harding started Sunday School in  
 about 1979.Three years running,we have
 gone on a trip to the 'Ely Children's 
 Festival'.This year we stopped at     
 Landbeach and we boated,swam and      
 played.Every week we collect money and
 some of it goes to charity.We work for
 ribbons with medals on.There are about
 20 people in it and each child has an 
 old person to care for and we go and  
 talk to them and make them presents.At
 Sunday School you hardly get told off 
 because the teachers are too kind.It  
 lasts an hour from 11.15-12.15. We    
 rent the village hall for our         
 meetings. Sunday School has been going
 about 6 years now and Mrs. Harding has
 always been in charge.                
 About 4 years ago Mrs.Beard moved to  
 the village so she helps now.
