		<title>07Trout Brook, near Winford</title>
		<content>   The best local fishing is in the    
 trout stream called "Little John"     
 Water. It is about five feet deep     
 after rain, but two feet in dry times 
 and very narrow. The stream runs from 
 Barrow Tanks then through a long pipe.
 We call it Winford Brook. There are   
 four different fish in the stream:    
 rainbow trout, brown trout, perch and 
 roach. The biggest trout caught down  
 there was 3lb 2oz. That was a rainbow 
 trout. The stream runs past Winford   
 Road Garage and into a reservoir at   
 Chew Magna. A few people fish there   
 but I find the best place to be is at 
 the weir. The bait we use is bread and
 worms. There is a five pound trout    
 down there to be caught.I caught it   
 when it was smaller but released it.
