		<title>02OPEN GOLF,ROYAL BIRKDALE</title>
		<content>  The British Open Golf Championship is
 an event of major golfing importance, 
 held annually,on various specially    
 selected golf courses.In 1983 this    
 event was held at the Royal Birkdale  
 golf course,Birkdale,Southport.       
  The Royal Birkdale golf course is of 
 average to extreme difficulty         
 (depending on the par of the hole in  
 play).Apart from the fact that it is  
 traditional to hold the competition at
 Birkdale every seven years or so, the 
 area also has several other features  
 in its favour.Birkdale is reasonably  
 accessible,it is in a pleasant        
 position,there is little objection    
 from local people and most of all     
 there is an abundance of spare land.  
 Much of this spare land belongs to    
 Greenbank High School as the 4 to 5   
 acres of school playing fields back on
 to the practice area of the club.     </content>
