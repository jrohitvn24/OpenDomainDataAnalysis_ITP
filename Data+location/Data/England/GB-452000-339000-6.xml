		<title>06SHIPSTONE'S BREWERY</title>
		<content> In 1852,{James Shipstone}opened up his
{brewery.}It is still here, in{        
{Basford}today.  Shipstone's may have  
 chosen this part of Nottingham to     
 start a brewery because the{          
{underground caves}are at the right    
 temperature for the fermentation of   
 beer.                                 
                                       
 The{'drays'}(or waggons), which       
 carried the barrels were pulled around
 the streets of Nottingham by{Shire    
{Horses}until the 1950's when lorries  
 replaced them.                        
                                       
 The children from Northgate Primary   
 School interviewed{Mr. Spence and Mr. 
{Kirkland}who have worked for          
 Shipstones for 40 years.
