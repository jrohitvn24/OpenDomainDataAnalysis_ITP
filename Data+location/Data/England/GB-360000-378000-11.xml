		<title>11Whitley Rose Queen</title>
		<content> Scouts,Brownies and Guides,then the   
 two Rose Queens &amp; their retinues; the 
 school country dance team and the play
 group trailer, also the entertainers  
 for that year. In April we have a film
 show of last year's Rose Queen and it 
 shows the Country dances, the new and 
 retiring Queens and their attendants. 
 After the film show we have a 'draw'  
 for the new Queen, who is usually from
 ll to 16 years and is chosen from the 
 children who live in Whitley parish.  
 The Crown bearer and train bearers are
 chosen from the younger boys; the     
 attendants are girls from 6 to 9      
 years. Pre-school children are chosen 
 to present small posies of flowers to 
 the President,the Chairman and their  
 wives. It seems that Rose Queen Fete  
 is a day when everyone comes together 
 and enjoys themselves in, with and for
 the village of Whitley.               </content>
