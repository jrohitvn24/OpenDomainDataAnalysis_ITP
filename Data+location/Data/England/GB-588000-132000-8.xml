		<content> Monday June 24th 1985 and Mr.Jackson  
 arrived at 10am from Ashford. Class 3 
 from Tenterden Junior were going  out 
 in groups to look at street           
 services,drains,hydrants and lighting.
 Mr.Jackson was going to explain things
 to each of us. We found out that each 
 house has its own stop-cock and       
 outside the flats were six little     
 water covers one for each of the flats
 Mr.Jackson  used his special levers   
 and removed some of the manhole covers
 so that we could see the steps leading
 down to the sewers. They were quite   
 clean really. We looked at the        
 different lamp posts. Some were old   
 gas lamps converted,others were the   
 "Chinese hat type". One near the road 
 junction had a tiny bulb on top which 
 was very sensitive to light and worked
 with all the other automatic mechanism
 to switch on when it was dark.        </content>
