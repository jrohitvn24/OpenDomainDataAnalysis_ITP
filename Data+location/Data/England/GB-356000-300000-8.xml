		<content>    Farming is very important in this  
 area and there are many fields.  Both 
 animal and arable farming is          
 prevalent.  Harnage Grange owns three 
 combine harvesters and there is a     
 considerable amount of arable farming.
 This large farm also keeps cows,      
 sheep, pheasants and bees.            
   However, farmers are employing fewer
 labourers than previously and so many 
 people work outside the area.         
 There are no factories (roads are very
 narrow for heavy vehicles), garages or
 engineering works. Dentists and       
 Doctors are based at Cressage and much
 Wenlock but do visit when necessary.  
   Although, nationally,  the          
 employment situation is difficult, it 
 does not seem to be a problem here and
 both men and women work in a variety  
 of jobs, if not farming, from chemist 
 to kitchen designer.                  </content>
