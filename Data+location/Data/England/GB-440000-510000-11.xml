		<title>11Yarm Fair</title>
		<content>{                                      
{ Yarm Fair}first began in 1874.The    
 family who first bought it passed     
 away and{Weigh and Tolls Committee    
 took over.                            
           The present problem is that 
 lots of new residants don't like the  
 fair because of the noise,lack of car 
 parking,and shops not being open as   
 they usually would be.                
                       The 18th 19th   
 and the 20th of October are the       
 traditional dates of the fair.These   
 days however the fair is held on days 
 nearest to the traditional dates as   
 possible.                             
          When it arrives on the       
 Tuesday police block off the road.The 
 fair itself opens on Thursdays and    
 stays open till midnight for three    
 days.                                 
                                       </content>
