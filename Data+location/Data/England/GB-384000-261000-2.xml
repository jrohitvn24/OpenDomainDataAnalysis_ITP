		<title>02The Trees of Ombersley Court</title>
		<content>{ Ombersley Court}is a magnificent     
 private house that belongs to Lord and
 Lady Sandys. The court was built in   
 the early 18th Century and the{grounds
 were landscaped in the first half of  
 the 19th Century.Through the          
 generations the Sandys family have    
 been very interested in the planting  
 of trees in the Estate.Visitors notice
 at once when they come into the parish
 of Ombersley, the abundance of        
 well-grown trees.The trees need a lot 
 of care and attention if they are to  
 grow well.                            
  Some of the trees are particularly   
 interesting.Their is a{Wellingtonia   
 which was actually planted by the{Duke
{of Wellington.}It took 13 children    
 holding hands to fit round the girth. 
 It is 124 feet high.Their is a        
{European Larch,}planted in 1738, which
 is 72ft tall and has a girth of 17ft. </content>
