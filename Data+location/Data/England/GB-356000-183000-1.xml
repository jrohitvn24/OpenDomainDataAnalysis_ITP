{farm animals }such as cattle and sheep

 Pilning,{Pilning Station, primary}    
{school}and village hall. Railway lines
 run through the area connecting the

 end of the area the land rises to a   
 limestone {promontory }Knole Park,    
 part of the village of {Almondsbury,  
 where a number of detached{houses}are 
 built in large gardens. At the foot of
 the hill lies on one side, Ibstock    
 Cattybrook{Brick Works}and on the     
 other a few modern houses, part of    
 Lower Almondsbury. The area is crossed
 by{footpaths, rhines}and a line of    
 pylons.  There are a number of rather 
 narrow metalled{roads.
