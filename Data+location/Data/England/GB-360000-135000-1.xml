		<title>01Ditcheat Hill &amp; Environment</title>
		<content> This is predominately a dairy farm    
 area.  Two farmhouse cheese making    
 units operate. (50 years ago there    
 were 10, on every farm)the number of  
 farmers and formstaff is approx 30% of
 1930, so many farmhouses on farms are 
 now ocupied by people from other.     
 Profesions and industries.  Probably  
 becaused the intercity railway station
 of castle cary (Paddington 11/2 hours)
 is only one mile south of this block  
 and also because Ditcheat village     
 (not ditcheat parish) was sewered     
 about 1970, the number of houses in   
 ditcheat village has increased by 60%.
 There are approx 1400 dairy cows,     
 producing about 11/2 million gallons  
 of milk annually, 1400 calves. (half  
 british friesian for milk and beef and
 half here hereford, for all beef). The
 primary producers value of the milk   
 and calves is at least Â£100M.         </content>
