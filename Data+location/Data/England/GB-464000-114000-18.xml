		<content>{HAMBLEDON HUNT}                       
 In the 18th century the area was      
 hunted by two gentlemen who kept      
 private packs of hounds.  In 1800 the 
 Hunt Club was formed by Thomas Butler 
 of Bury Lodge; and the pack kennelled 
 at Hook Vinney Farm.  The Hunt        
 continued under various masters until 
 the last war when the hounds were     
 boarded out with the North Cornwall.  
 In 1945 they went to the Hunt Kennels 
 at Ropley, but after several moves are
 now boarded at Droxford, and forty one
 and a half couple hounds are kept.    
 In 1978 the Hursley Hounds having no  
 master, amalgamated with the Hambledon
 Hunt.                                 
 The new hunt meets twice a week, on   
 Wednesday and Saturday and more days  
 if requested by farmers.  The places  
 of meeting are the Denmead, Wickham,  
 Langrish triangle and the Hurley area.</content>
