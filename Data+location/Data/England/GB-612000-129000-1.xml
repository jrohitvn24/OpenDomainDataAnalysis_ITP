		<content> Dymchurch Village stretches 2.7 miles 
 along the South Eastern coast of Kent.
 It is protected from the English      
 Channel by a strong stone sea wall    
 which has been a feature of this low  
 lying area for hundreds of years. The 
 Eastern end of Dymchurch has a ribbon 
 of homes close to the coast. It is    
 backed by the fertile farm land of    
 Romney Marsh, which is drained by an  
 effective, attractive system of dykes,
 rich in animal, plant life. Beach     
 Estate, a housing area of bungalows   
 and two storey homes, has mainly been 
 built since 1960. Planning permission 
 is no longer given for bungalows.     
 Tourism is an import source of income.
 The New Beach Holiday Centre with     
 caravan and chalet accommodation      
 attracts holiday makers who come      
 particularly from Kent and London.
