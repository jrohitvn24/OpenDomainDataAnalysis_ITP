		<title>16CHANGES IN NESSCLIFFE</title>
		<content> In the late l92Os, early 3Os, the     
 village of Nesscliffe was very much as
 it is today, in the structural sense, 
 other than a couple of new houses and 
 the council estate, The Crescent,     
 built on the edge of the village. The 
 garage has been moved, it was on the  
 bend opposite the Nesscliffe Hotel. By
 the Hotel, on what is now a car park, 
 were 4 or 5 stables, these had been   
 used in the earlier years for the     
 travellers' horses.  The Blacksmith's 
 Shop was always a very busy place with
 farmers taking their horses to be     
 shod. You could always hear the sound 
 of the hammer hitting the anvil as Mr 
 Jones made and fitted the horses      
 shoes. The old school was heated by   
 two coal fires in winter and at ll.5O 
 each day a large kettle was put on one
 to make hot drinks of cocoa or oxo the
 children had brought with them.       </content>
