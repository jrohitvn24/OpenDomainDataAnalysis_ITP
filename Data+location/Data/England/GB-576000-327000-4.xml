 TITIAN, REMBRANDT ect. hung on the    
 walls. In the Stone Hall and in the   
 Picture Gallery are still to be seen  
 antique busts acquired by Robert      
 Walpole when the house was first      
 built.The bronze LAOCOON, from the    
 workshop of GIRARDON who did many     
 sculptures for Louis 14th., still     
 stands in the Stone Hall.Robert       
 Walpole's grandson George third Earl  
 of Orford, was responsible for the    
 removal of many of the pictures. He

 insanity when he sold many of the     
 pictures,some to other collectors
