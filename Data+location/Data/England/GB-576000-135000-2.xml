		<title>02  The Parish Council</title>
		<content>The Parish Council plays an important  
part in the life of the local          
community. The council,which meets     
once a month is divided into many      
committees each responsible for        
different areas of council policy.     
These are the crane valley, burial     
grounds and churchyards , town         
planning, street lighting and litter,  
recreation, the vestry hall, and       
finance. At present the council is     
concerned with toilet facilities in the
vestry hall , the war memorial ,       
lighting provisions , and litter bins  
and tombstone repairs in the           
churchyard . Vandalism and graffiti are
a cause for concern , as are the       
problems of bored youngsters and noisy 
motorbikes . The council is now        
concerned with the old cinema becoming 
a supermarket .                        
                                       </content>
