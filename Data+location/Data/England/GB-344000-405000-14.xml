		<title>14INDUSTRY IN SKELMERSDALE</title>
		<content>   When Skelmersdale New Town was      
 planned in the early 1960s,several    
 areas were designated as industrial   
 estates.These were mainly to be       
 situated on the fringe of the town so 
 as to be convenient for the major     
 motorway network and close to         
 employees' homes.Three such areas are 
 included in our Domesday block.These  
 are Gillibrands,Westgate and Stanley  
 estates.                              
   Gillibrands is by far the biggest.At
 the present time approximately 50     
 companies of varying size occupy      
 premises there.These include a tin can
 manufacturing firm,clothing           
 factories,metal fabrication works     
 and some food industries.As well as   
 manufacturers there are printers,     
 packagers and youth training centres.
