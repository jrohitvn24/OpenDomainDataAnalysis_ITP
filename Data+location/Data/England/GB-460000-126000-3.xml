		<title>03The Landscape of Bramdean</title>
		<content> Bramdean is situated in a shallow dry 
 valley in chalk downland.   It has one
 of the largest areas of beechwood in  
 Hampshire.  Another feature of the    
 landscape are the small fields and    
 ancient hedgerows with their numerous 
 flowering trees.  This pattern is     
 interspersed with the scattered houses
 and farmsteads, which are mainly built
 of flint and brick with some old stone
 buildings.  The majority of the houses
 in the area lie in the heart of the   
 village; which is at the base of the  
 valley, in the intersection of the    
 main road with a lane leading to      
 Bramdean Common.  On the fringes of   
 the village there are extensive views 
 across the South Downs.
