 by 1086.{Crawley,}a newcomer, was a   
 medieval hamlet on{Slaugham's}parish  
 boundary. Growth modestly overtook    
 Ifield as the embryo town emerged     
 astride its transport routes. On      
{9.1.1947}Crawley and much of Ifield   
 were incorporated in 6000 acres of a  
 New Town. The master plan was by      
 Anthony Minoprio, planning consultant

 balanced age structures emerged but   
 Bewbush (76) is more youthful than    
 West Green (49). From 1978 the Borough
 Council has owned housing assets but  
 the Commission keeps commercial       
 property which it develops, e.g. land 
 near the station for parking, bus     
 station and department store.{In 1985
