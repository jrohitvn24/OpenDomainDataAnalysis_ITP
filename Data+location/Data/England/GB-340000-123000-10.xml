		<title>10Midelney Manor (1)</title>
		<content>  I was born in Berlin in 1949.I came  
 to Britain as a child and attended    
 Fivehead primary school and then Huish
 Episcopi secondary school.I married in
 1972 and for the next 7 years lived in
 Wiltshire and Dorset.We moved         
 to Midelney in 1979.   I worked for   
 Major and Mrs Trevilian who live in   
 the Manor.In my job I used to clean   
 the manor each morning from nine until
 twelve.If Mrs Trevilian had house     
 guests I used to help prepare the     
 bedrooms and help prepare the         
 meals.One of my duties was to do the  
 washing except for sheets which were  
 sent to a laundry.My least favourite  
 job was the annual task of scrubbing  
 the huge hall floor.Donning my        
 wellington boots and clutching a long 
 handled scrubbing brush,I used to     
 scour the floor,thankful when the last
 stone was clean.                      </content>
