		<content>  As in most villages in the Teesdale  
 area,the architecture of the buildings
 in Boldron displays a shrewd mixture  
 of the very old and the modern styles.
  The most prominent buildings are the 
 church,chapel and village hall,though 
 the last is a much newer structure.   
  There is a total of 33 houses which, 
 for the most part,stand on each side  
 of the village green.The older houses,
 together with several farm-buildings,

 common Teesdale Slate roofs.The oldest
 of these is Green Cottage on which the
 date{1561}can be clearly seen.

 building materials which fit in well  
 with the environment.In some cases the
 older properties have been modernised,
 cleverly blending the old with the new</content>
