		<title>08FARMING NEAR SKEGNESS</title>
		<content>{LINCOLNSHIRE}is an agricultural       
 area.Many of the vegetables needed in 
 England are grown here.Some small     
 farms are privately owned by the      
 farmers themselves but the larger     
 farms tend to be owned by large       
 companies.Although {Skegness}is a     
 seaside tourist town there are farms  
 within one mile of the town           
 centre.Farming here is an             
 industry.Farmers try to produce bigger
 and better crops.To do this they use a
 lot of{chemical sprays}to kill weeds  
 or make the crop grow bigger or       
 faster.There is a growing group of    
 people who do not like this and want  
 to change this policy.One group is the
{Templegarth Trust}who try to eat food 
 grown without the use of              
 chemicals.They are worried about      
 farmers removing hedgerows to enlarge 
 fields so destroying animal habitats. </content>
