		<content> Here are three of the games we        
 play at our school at playtimes.      
{Granny's Footsteps:}someone is "on it"
 and that person stands not facing the 
 other people.When the person that is  
 "on it" faces the wall you take as    
 many steps as you can until the person
 turns around.If he sees you still     
 running YOU are "on it".              
                                       
{Chain chase:}somebody is "on it" and  
 when he or she catches a person he has
 to hold hands with him or her. When   
 you get up to four, you split into two
 pairs and so on.                      
                                       
{What's the time Mr.Wolf:}somebody     
 faces the wall,the others walk slowly 
 up to him and say,"What's the time    
 Mr.Wolf?" He says a time. If he says  
 'Dinner time' you run back to the     
 start.                                </content>
