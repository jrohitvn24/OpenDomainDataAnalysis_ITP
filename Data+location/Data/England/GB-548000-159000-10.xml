{old.}We have infants and juniors in   
 brick buildings. The infants building 
 is old, the juniors have a modern     
 building with a library and a big     
 hall.The canteen cooks are the people 
 who cook dinners, and the dinner      
 ladies look after us when it is dinner

   In summer we play in our big field  
 and in winter we play on the          
 playground. We have a small{nature    
{area, a pond and a nature trail       
{nearby.

 to be seven but there are not so many 
 children in the village now. We have a
 play school attached to the infants   
 building and a P.T.A. which buys      
 things for the school.
