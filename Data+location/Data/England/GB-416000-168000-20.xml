		<content> In general, boys enter this totally   
 boarding Public School at the age of  
 13. Girls, since 1968 and further boys
 are accepted in the sixth form (A     
 level years). Roughly 150 full time   
 staff teach and care for 760 boys and 
 100 girls, who are accomodated in 15  
 boarding houses.                      
                                       
 Approximately 70% gain a University   
 place, of whom 20% reach Oxford or    
 Cambridge.  The rest largely go on to 
 other forms of further education or   
 the forces.                           
                                       
 About half the parents of students are
 in the professions and the other half 
 in business; as far as can be told,   
 the students follow roughly the same  
 pattern in their own careers.
