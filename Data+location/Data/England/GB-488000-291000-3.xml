		<title>03Gretton House made safe</title>
		<content>A battle by Gretton villagers for      
action to be taken over a burned-out   
house has finally come to an end. The  
house,in Corby Road, owned by the      
British Steel Corporation, was burned  
down two years ago and the Parish      
Council declared it to be an eyesore,  
completely spoiling the entrance to the
village.                               
     However, work on the house has now
 been started and a British Steel      
spokesman has said that the building   
would be partly demolished and made    
safe. He could not reveal when the work
would be finished or how much it would 
cost. At the time of writing this page 
work was nearly completed but no plans 
for rebuilding have as yet been        
published.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
