		<title>17PROBLEMS OF THE RIVER</title>
		<content>{The Mersey}is heavily polluted, having
 a large effect on the ecology of the  
 area. The pollution is a result of    
 chemical waste, sewage, rubbish and   
 contamination with silt. The North    
 West Water Authority has estimated    
 that over the next 20 years, in excess
 of Â£2000 million will be needed to    
 control the pollution. Although it is 
 necessary to continually clean the    
 water, dredging is only required where
 the Mersey is part of the Ship Canal. 
    The other major problem caused by  
 the River is that of traffic          
 congestion in Warrington itself. In   
 this area, the only ways to cross the 
 Mersey are at Bridge Foot, in the town
 centre, and at Kingsway Bridge. A     
 scheme is at present underway to      
 improve the crossing at Bridge Foot.
