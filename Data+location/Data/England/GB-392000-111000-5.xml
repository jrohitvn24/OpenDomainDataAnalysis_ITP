		<content> There is a small telephone exchange at
 Tarrant Hinton serving this area. Each
 village has its own public call box.  
 The nearest Police Station is at      
 Blndford and we have regular visits   
 from the same officer who has         
 travelled this 'beat' in his car for  
 15 years                              
 There is little crime apart from      
 petty thieving and some poaching of   
 deer and pheasant for which the area  
 was infamous in past centuries.       
 The only form of transport from the   
 villages is a once-a-week bus service 
 to Bandford.                          
 A more frequent service to the larger,
 more distant towns passes along the   
 A354.                                 
 Most households have at least one car 
 and many people travel within or      
 between villages by bicycle.
