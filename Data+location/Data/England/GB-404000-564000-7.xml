		<content> BECAUSE MANY OF THE FARMS IN THIS AREA
 ARE SMALL THEY HAVE TO DIVERSIFY AND  
 SEEK OTHER SOURCES OF INCOME.THESE    
 INCLUDE KEEPING FREE_RANGE DUCKS AND  
 HENS AND SELLING THE EGGS,BREEDING    
 GAME BIRDS AND ESTABLISHING SMALL     
 CARAVAN SITES OR DOING BED AND        
 BREAKFAST.THESE ARE THE TYPES OF FARM 
 THAT THE MANAGER OF {NAFFERTON }PAGE 5
 BELIEVES MAY SOON GO OUT OF BUSINESS. 
 MANY FARMS NOW SELL PRODUCE TO THE    
 PUBLIC.{NORTH ACOMB FARM }DOES THIS   
 AND HAS A WELL STOCKED SHOP SELLING   
 MEAT FOR THE THE FREEZER,CHICKENS,EGGS
 MILK,CREAM AND BUTTER.UNFORTUNATELY   
 ONLY A CAR OWNER CAN EASILY REACH IT  
 AS THE SHOP IS A LONG WAY FROM THE    
 MAIN ROAD.IT IS ON A HILL AND AFFORDS 
 A MAGNIFICENT VIEW OF THE SURROUNDING 
 COUNTRYSIDE,SO THERE ARE              
 COMPENSATIONS.
