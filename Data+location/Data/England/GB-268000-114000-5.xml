		<content> As the area is largely clays with a   
 high water table (saturated clays     
 become an impervious rock) it is used 
 mainly for pastural purposes. The     
 higher wetter lands are rough grazing 
 moors. The steeper (not easily        
 controlled by the agricultuural       
 tractor) lands, especially the north  
 facing slopes, are forested. Apart    
 from the Forestry Commission's        
 Longmoor Woods, the other 25 copse or 
 woods are mixed-woods. Walkers about  
 the area, and drivers too, are soon   
 aware of the individual buzzards      
 habitats. Albeit deer, foxes,         
 badgers,pheasants, partridges and the 
 like, their habitats are not so easy  
 to detect although they are seen, and,
 indeed, known to some.
