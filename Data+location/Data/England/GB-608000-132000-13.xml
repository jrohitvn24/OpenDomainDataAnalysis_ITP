		<title>13St. Stephen's Church Lympne.</title>
		<content>   The original twelfth century Church 
 has been much enlarged and repaired   
 over the centuries and it stands next 
 to Lympne Castle.                     
   When I visited the Church it was    
 unlocked; it was decorated with fresh 
 flowers, the tiled floors were        
 polished and everything smelt sweet   
 and clean. On the table there were    
 leaflets, the Parish Magazine among   
 them, from which I gathered news of   
 the activities in the surrounding     
 villages: confirmations, Remembrance  
 Day, Parish Council meetings, Guides  
 and the Women's Institute.            
   In the Children's Corner there was a
 display of collages: "Mummie doing    
 Things" and "The Tempest".Handworked  
 kneelers lay on the pews, and I had   
 the feeling that everyone had only    
 just left.                            
                                       </content>
