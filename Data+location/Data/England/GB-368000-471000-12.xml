		<title>12Caravan Sites in Ingleton</title>
		<content> I interviewed Mrs Morphet. People all 
 over the world come to this caravan   
 site. There are 52 caravans on the    
 site. Some of them are privately      
 owned. If some one broke anything in  
 the caravan they would pay for its    
 replacement but if they didn't report 
 it the thing they had broken would be 
 insured.Mrs Morphet has been in charge
 for 15 years but the site has been in 
 the family since the beginning. The   
 caravan site is called Holme Head     
 Caravan Site.There has been a new     
 caravan this year and there are new   
 replacements every year. If a caravan 
 burst in flames it would burn in      
 seconds. Garry and I interviewed a man
 called Mr Greenwood. He has a caravan 
 site and behind his house he has some 
 caravans for sale. He has fifteen     
 caravans for sale altogether.
