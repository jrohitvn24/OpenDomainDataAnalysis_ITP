		<title>11My School Day Continued</title>
		<content> I then rush home,get a quick tea and  
 go to guides.Guides ends at 9.00.I go 
 home have a bath and something to eat 
 and finally,at around 10.30,I fall in 
 to bed with my eyes closed and fall to
 sleep.                                
                                       
    This is an average day in the life 
 of a Primary School pupil aged 11. A  
 great many children are members of    
 clubs and societies but there is a    
 great lack of leisure facilities such 
 as swimming pools, tennis courts and  
 sports centres. A great deal of time  
 is spent by parents transporting      
 children into Altrincham,Stockton     
 Heath and Warrington where such       
 facilities exist.
