		<content> A few sheep are kept but most farms   
 carry too many cows to be able to run 
 sheep as well.  The breeds are        
 Mashams, Mules, and Suffolks.  Mashams
 are Scottish black-faced crossed with 
 Teeswater, and Mules are Scottish     
 black-faced crossed with Border       
 Leicester.  The Suffolk "tups" (rams) 
 are pure bred.  The sheep are lambed  
 in February which means they were     
 "tupped" (mated) in October.  The     
 lambs  are sold for meat in June at   
 Lancaster Auction or to the Fatstock  
 Marketing Corporation.  Clipping is   
 done in June, and the wool is sold to 
 the Wool Marketing Board.
