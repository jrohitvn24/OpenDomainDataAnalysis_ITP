		<title>15WOODLAND - PETWORTH RURAL NE</title>
		<content> Gandersgate Lane hedge contains       
 oak, ash, hawthorn, spindleberry,     
 dogrose, bramble, honeysuckle, hazel, 
 maple, crab apple, sallow and dogwood.
 In Pitsall's Copse there are young    
 plantations of conifer, silver birch  
 and poplar. East of the A272 lie The  
 Cut - so named after being separated  
 from the main wood in the 19th        
 century, and The Mens, (from          
 'Mennesse', old English for common    
 land). In AD 953 it was pannage, and  
 commoners' grazing rights still       
 remain. Of specie, the woods hold 194 
 flowers, 43 trees and shrubs, 22      
 butterflies, a great many birds,      
 rabbits, foxes, a few deer escaped    
 from Petworth Park and some wild mink 
 - a plague to farmers. These 358 acres
 have been bought by The Sussex Trust  
 for Nature Conservation, which now    
 owns 1,500 acres.                     </content>
