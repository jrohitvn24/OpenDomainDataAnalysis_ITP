		<title>18Windsor Great Park</title>
		<content> Windsor Gt. Park covers an area of    
 4800 acres and includes parkland,     
 beautiful gardens, woodland, Royal    
 lodges and numerous monuments.        
 There are references to the Gt. Park  
 in{the first Domesday Survey}which    
 mentions the enclosure of some  of the
 Kings woodland at Windsor in 1086 . By
 1129 a Parker was paid to feed the    
 birds. By 1241 King Henry 3rd had     
 allocated more of Windsor forest and  
 created much of the Gt. Park that is  
 known today.                          
{In the 1980's}the Great Park receives 
{over 60000 visitors}during summer     
 weekends. They are attracted by the   
{long walk,}constructed in 1680,{Savill
{Gardens}created in 1931 by Sir Eric   
 Savill and{Virginia Water,}dug by the 
 troops in 1789. Apart from walking    
 ,cycling or horseriding, many{joggers}
 use the Gt. Park.                     </content>
