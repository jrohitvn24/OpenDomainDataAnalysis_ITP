		<content>   Lowdham is a village situated eight 
 miles north-east of Nottingham.It is  
 sited at the crossing of two main     
 roads;the A6097 linking Doncaster and 
 Leicester and the A612 linking        
 Nottingham with Newark.               
   The village lies on the edge of the 
 Trent Valley ,approximately two miles 
 from the river.                       
   Lowdham was one of the first        
 commuter villages around Nottingham.  
 In 1846 a station was built at Lowdham
 by the Midland Railway Company.       
 Gradually Victorian properties were   
 built here by those working in        
 Nottingham.                           
   The number of people living in      
 Lowdham now exceeds two thousand,     
 although few people work locally.
