		<title>14The Residential Area.</title>
		<content>The eastern edge of our block is the   
only densely populated area but very   
few families have lived in the area for
any length of time. The majority of men
have work. There are some large        
families but mostly the families have  
three or less children. Basic          
foodstuffs are bought locally otherwise
families shop in the larger towns      
nearby. There are excellent bus        
services to these towns as well as     
about half the families having a car.  
Most of the families stay at home for  
entertainment, television and videos   
providing most of this. A few children 
belong to clubs. Some parents are      
members of local societies. There is a 
thriving Community Centre which was    
built 1972. There is a daily playgroup,
ladies groups use it in the afternoons 
and each evening it is used for all    
kinds of youth activities.             </content>
