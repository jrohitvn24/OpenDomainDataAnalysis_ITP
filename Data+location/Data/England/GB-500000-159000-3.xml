		<content>  The Woking, Horsell and Woodham      
 Cottage Hospital started in 1894 in a 
 converted house.                      
  From money collected during Queen    
 Victoria's Diamond Jubilee a new      
 hospital was built in Chobham Road and
 opened in 1899, called the{Woking     
{Victoria Hospital.}This is now a part 
 of the National Health Service but its
 future is uncertain as it is small and
 in need of modernisation. Its         
 facilities include a minor casualty   
 unit and out-patient and X-ray        
 departments. Serious cases are        
 referred to St. Peter's Hospital in   
 Chertsey.                             
{ The Woking Nuffield Hospital}in      
 Shores Road is a modern private       
 hospital run by B.U.P.A., the British 
 United Provident Association. Recent  
 building has greatly increased the    
 accomodation and facilities available.</content>
