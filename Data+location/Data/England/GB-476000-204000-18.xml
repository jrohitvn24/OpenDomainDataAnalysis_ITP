		<content> Mayday Cont.  Nowadays Mayday has to  
 be on a school day so that the        
 children can easily be gathered       
 together.  Their efforts are judged in
 the school and then paraded round the 
 village.  Silver cups are awarded in  
 each section and all the children are 
 rewarded with small amounts of        
 money.                                
 Listed Buildings.  There are four     
 listed buildings, two farm houses, the
 old Baptist Chapel (now an old        
 people's home) and Longwick Mill.  It 
 is hoped to make some flint buildings 
 listed in the future.                 
 Parish Council.  There are seven      
 members of the Parish Council         
 representing the five villages that   
 make up the civil parish of           
 Longwick-cum-Ilmer.
