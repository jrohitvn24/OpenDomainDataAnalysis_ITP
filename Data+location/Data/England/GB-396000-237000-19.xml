		<title>19ORNITHOLOGY OF BREDON HILL</title>
		<content>   Anyone walking over the hill could  
 almost guarantee to hear and see      
 thrushes, blackbirds, chaffinches and 
 robins at any time. In spring and     
 early summer, to these would be added 
 swallows, swifts, sandmartins, willow 
 warblers, whitethroats, wrens, yellow 
 buntings (hammers), blackcaps, linnets
 green and spotted woodpeckers, many   
 kinds of tits, larks, tree creepers,  
 goldfinches, greenfinches, collard    
 doves, pheasants, partridges, cuckoos,
 screach owls, little owls and the     
 occasional barn owl.                  
   In autumn fieldfares and red wings  
 are common. Less common are kestrels, 
 buzzards, stock doves, curlews and    
 plovers.Meadow pipits and redstarts   
 have been seen and a hobby hawk is    
 thought to have nested. Bullfinches   
 are fairly common but are not welcomed
 by the farmers.                       </content>
