		<title>10WORMBRIDGE COURT</title>
		<content> The farmhouse now known as{Wormbridge 
{Court}was once the stables of         
{Wormbridge House,}the manor house     
 which stood where our school          
 playground is now. The house is built 
 of red brick and there is a yard with 
 farm buildings and a pond at the back.
 Horses for riding and hunting are     
 still kept on the farm.               
 The house stands on the A465 road and 
 the farm is the biggest in Wormbridge.
 There is a{farm shop}next to the house
 where vegetables are sold. Most of    
 these are grown on the farm land or in
 the{greenhouses}across the road, next 
 to the school. Some of the vegetables 
 grown in the field are cabbages,      
 cauliflowers, brussel sprouts and     
 lettuce. Last year the big pond next  
 to the school pitch was deepened and  
 extended so that these vegetables can 
 be{irrigated}in dry weather.          </content>
