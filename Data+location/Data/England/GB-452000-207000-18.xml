		<title>18LIFE IN EDEN DRIVE.</title>
		<content>  At the entrance to{Eden Drive}is the 
 modern{Roman Catholic Church}of{St.}  
{Anthony.}Next door is{Rayson House}   
 (see Old People's Homes). There are{4}
 large detached houses and{3}others    
 next door.{No. 22}belongs to{Mr}and   
{Mrs Tucker.}From{1954}to{1981}it was a
 butcher's shop. The shop closed partly
 because more customers began to use   
{Supermarkets,}and also, the{Tuckers}  
 wanted to retire.The{Tuckers}live next
 to a store which closed down in{1979.}
  Opposite them is{Shepheard's}grocer's
 shop,which closed in{Feb. 1985.}The   
 owners have retired and want to change
 it into a bigger house. Out of 4 shops
 only the{Post Office}remains open,    
 relying on the custom of old people   
 living close.                         
  Near to the{John Radcliffe Hospital} 
 there is a play park for the children,
 with swings, a roundabout and a slide.</content>
