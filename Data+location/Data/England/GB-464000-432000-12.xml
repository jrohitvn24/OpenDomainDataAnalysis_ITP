		<content>      Cliffe Fair is held on the third 
 Sunday in June on the playing field.  
 It is organised by the{clubs}in the   
 village.                              
      It starts with a parade of       
 decorated floats through the village, 
 and there is a fancy dress competition
 and other stalls, competitions and    
 displays. Often there is the Coal     
 Board Castle, like a big air bed in   
 the shape of a castle that you can    
 bounce on.                            
      The money that is raised is      
 shared out among the clubs in the     
 village. This year, 1985, over Â£700   
 was raised. The Village Institute and 
 Playing Field got Â£180 each, the      
 Women's Institute, Youth Club, Tennis 
 Club and playgroup got Â£50 each, and  
 another eight clubs or groups each    
 received Â£20.
