		<title>08Alton Saturday (1)</title>
		<content>    On a typical Saturday I would get  
 up at about 10:00 a.m. I would go     
 downstairs and have breakfast of a    
 cereal which could be either Weetabix,
 Cornflakes,Rice Krispies or Bran      
 Flakes and some toast which is cooked 
 bread.                                
    After that I would go back upstairs
 and get dressed.The sort of clothes I 
 wear are sports clothes because       
 "breakers" wear them."Breakers" are   
 people who do breakdancing,which is a 
 kind of gymnastic dance.There are     
 various moves some of which are the   
 windmill,1990, footwork.              
    After that I would go into town,   
 normally I would walk but for some    
 reason e.g. bad weather i.e. hail,    
 rain or snow, I would go in the car.  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
