		<title>17ILKESTON INNER RELIEF ROAD</title>
		<content> Ilkeston is in a state of change. One 
 of these changes is likely to be an{  
{inner relief road}from{White Lion     
{Square}to the bottom of {Heanor Road.}
 The proposed new road will be {dual   
{carriageway.}Quite a number of people 
 think that Ilkeston doesn't need this 
 road but it is almost certain to be   
 built.                                
 Down{Bath Street} and a few more      
 streets, houses have been knocked down
 and shops too. Also shops have closed 
 and moved to other places in the town.
{Chaucer School}will be affected       
 because the road is cutting through   
 part of their playing field, far too  
 close to the school. On{East Street}  
 there will be a{subway}and the people 
 who live there are worried by the     
 possible dangers from trouble-makers  
 lurking around.
