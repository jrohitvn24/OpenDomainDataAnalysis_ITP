		<content>  TO LISKEARD,PLYMOUTH AND OTHER       
 PLACES. CHILDREN MUST ALSO COMMUTE TO 
 SCHOOL THERE BEINB NO SCHOOL AT ALL IN
 THE BLOCK. LIKEWISE THERE ARE NO      
 BAMKS, BENEFIT OFFICES, DOCTOR'S      
 SURGERIES OR DENTISTS IN THE BLOCK.   
 THERE IS HOWEVER ONE POST OFFICE.     
 TRANSPORT IS THEREFORE ESSENTIAL AS   
 FEW PEOPLE ARE TRULY SELF SUFFICIENT. 
  THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT OF THE BLOCK IS 
 ALSO INTERESTING. AT PRESENT          
 HERODSFOOT VILLAGE IS IN THE CARE OF  
 THREE DIFFERENT PARISH COUNCILS,      
 DULOE, LANREATH, AND ST.PINNOCK. AT   
 THE MOMENT HOWEVER PLANS ARE BEING    
 DRAWN UP TO BRING THE WHOLE OF        
 HERODSFOOT UNDER DULOE.               
  THE BLOCK IS INTENSELY BEAUTIFUL, AND
 MORE REMOTE THAN SOME AREAS ADDING TO 
 ITS TOURIST VALUE. THE FORESTRY       
 COMMISSION IS AMONG THOSE LETTING     
 CHALETS.                              </content>
