 area.There are 70 cattle,40 sheep and 
 10 pigs.The farm drops 60 m down to   
 its boundary on the River Dee.The     
 family have owned the farm since      
 1945.Most of the buildings have been  
 built in the last 10 years, but the   
 farmhouse is a timbered frame 15th    
 century building.The only crop on this
 farm is grass.                        
 HOME FARM:This neighbouring farm is   
 200 acres in area and also is bounded 
 by the river.1000 sheep are           
 intensively farmed together with 12   
 beef cattle.

 found at the entrance to this farm in 
 that the metal gates are made up of   
 many horseshoes welded together to    
 form patterns.
