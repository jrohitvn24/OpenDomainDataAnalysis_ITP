		<content>{7.45am} As they say,"the early morning
         bird gets the worm first" but 
         that's not me! Anyway, I go   
         and get a wash, brush my teeth
         and get dressed. Then I go    
         downstairs and have an        
         argument with my mum because I
         won't have any breakfast.     
{8.30am} Set off to school and get     
         there about twenty to nine.   
         When it is time we go in for  
         registration. Then on a       
         Thursday we have single Games,
         followed by single Geography, 
         and after break we have       
         French.{Then dinner.}         
{1.20pm} Back for registration, then   
         double maths, afternoon break,
         followed by Design. We go home
         at {4.00pm.}                  
{6.30pm} Get ready for the disco.      
{10.00pm}Set off home. Then go to bed. </content>
