   During the last 30 years,many new   
houses have been built in Mawdesley,   
increasing the population by a third.  
There is a greater variety of jobs;many
professional people travel to towns to 
work.There has been a decline in rural 
occupations.Fewer people work on the   
land and in the local basket industry. 
   The new village hall has provided a 
centre for community life.More people  
take part in sports and games,enjoying 
increased hours of leisure.            
   The population of Eccleston has     
doubled over the last thirty years.    
There was much opposition to the       
building of houses on farmland known as
Long Meadows.The farmhouse,Red House,  
built in 1673, is still occupied,but   
is  no longer a farm.
