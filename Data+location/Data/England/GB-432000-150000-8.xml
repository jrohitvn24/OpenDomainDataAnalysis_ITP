		<title>08A CHILD'S WEEKEND-HATHERDEN.</title>
		<content> On a typical Sunday I wake_up at      
 about 7 o'clock in the morning and    
 read until about 8 o'clock.Then I have
 a bowl of Frosties with milk and a    
 glass of apple juice.That takes me to 
 about 8:15 and then I go to get       
 changed for football.I am a member of 
 Thatcham Tornadoes who play near      
 Newbury.I have played for them for    
 three years and this season we won our
 Under 11 league. That takes me till   
 12:30 when I go for lunch.After that I
 go birdwatching with my Dad in Long   
 Parish which is by the River Test.I   
 use 10x50 binoculars and have seen a  
 pied flycatcher which is not usually  
 found in England.That takes me about  
 two hours and when I get home  I go   
 out and play on my B.M.X bike until   
 tea at 6:30.Then I read until bed at 9
 o'clock. Paul Wood aged 11.
