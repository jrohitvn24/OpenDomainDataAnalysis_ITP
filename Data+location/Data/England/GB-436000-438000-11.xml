		<content> The older housing (besides farm       
 buildings), is found along Main       
 Street. There is an estate of post    
 Second World War housing behind St.   
 Peter's church.                       
                                       
 The majority of houses on Main Street 
 appear to have been built between 1700
 and 1850. There are some infills      
 between, these dating from Victorian  
 times to post second world war.       
 Building materials of the oldest and  
 newest houses tend to be stone walls  
 and slate roofs, though there are red 
 brick Victorian houses too.           
                                       
 Many houses are terraced, or linked to
 the house next door, even though they 
 date from different periods.
