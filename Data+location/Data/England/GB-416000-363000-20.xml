		<content> Home life revolves around the family. 
 They have their main meal together,   
 Evenings are spent maintaining or     
 improving the home, watching TV,      
 listening to radio or records, sewing,
 gardening, various hobbies, organising
 village functions, entertaining       
 friends and relatives. The husband    
 helps with household chores. About    
 half the homes have a telephone. Most 
 have as many as 15 electical          
 appliances and about 80% own at least 
 one car. Most have all standard       
 amenities. Traditional English cooking
 is still the norm. Some homes have    
 burglar alarms and special locks      
 fitted. The most popular pet is the   
 cat then dog, birds, fish and small   
 mammals. The village has no shop or   
 pub but many foods, hardware and      
 newspapers are delivered regularly or 
 sold by travelling vendors.           </content>
