		<title>01GENERAL INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content> This area represents a great variety  
of lifestyle within a small area. It   
consists of the region south of        
Dartford Parish Church, the villages of
Wilmington and Hawley and surrounding  
farmland, heath and parkland. The      
dominant features of the area are      
the roads, especially the A.2.(T) and  
the M.25 which meet at an important    
intersection within this area. This    
provides links with the north of       
England through the Dartford Tunnel and
south to Dover and the Continent.      
                                       
 Much of the area lies within the      
Green Belt and so the natural beauty   
remains in many parts, giving          
residents of Dartford and the villages 
the opportunity of a breath of fresh   
air not too far from home.
