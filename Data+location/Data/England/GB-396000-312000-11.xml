		<content>Our school is called West Hill         
Juniors. It is a very old school built 
originally in 1876. The school is      
separated into two parts-the main block
and senior block which used to be an   
old army hospital but has been         
modernised with carpets and blinds. At 
the present time there are 308 children
attending, aged between 7-11 years.    
There are 14 teachers including the    
headmaster. We are taught English,     
Maths,Science,History,Geography,Music, 
Art and Craft,Religion and Drama. We   
also have P.E, Games and Swimming      
lessons. There are lots of clubs after 
school like Netball,Football,Pottery,  
Gym,Badminton and Nature. I like       
school,because you can get involved in 
lots of different activities and don't 
get bored. We go on school trips to    
places like Chatterly Whitfield Mine   
and Shugborough Camp.                  </content>
