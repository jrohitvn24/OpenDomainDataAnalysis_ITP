		<title>11THE FARMER, WEST BURTON</title>
		<content> Douglas's farm is on the edge of West 
 Burton. He has 230 acres of grass land
 and rough grazing. The farm has a     
 dairy herd of 42 Friesian cows with 40
 followers (young stock which will join
 the herd later) and 250 ewes to lamb  
 half-bred lambs. The lambs are        
 fattened and in September/October they
 are sold and go down country for      
 better grazing. The milk goes to Hawes
 creamery. It is collected by bulk     
 tanker. When the cows are old they go 
 to market to be sold for beef. Bull   
 calves are sold at three weeks.       
 Douglas now has a son helping him so  
 that he is able to go on holiday with 
 his wife in October each year. Douglas
 has 2 sheepdogs which he trains       
 himself. They help with the cows and  
 sheep. He also keeps some hens.       
 Douglas is on the local Parish Council
 and is very keen on cricket.          </content>
