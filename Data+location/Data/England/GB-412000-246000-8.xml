		<content> Pebworth Retained Fire Station is     
 manned 24 hours by part time firemen  
 (milkman, carpenter, farmer, builder, 
 lorry driver and 2 security guards and
 3 full time firemen who work at the   
 nearby military camp). They wear      
 yellow protective clothing and helmets
 and are called by personal alerters to
 domestic incidents, those on farms and
 at Long Lartin maximum security       
 prison. The new fire engine (a red    
 Dennis water tender) is fully equipped
 to deal with any emergency. Retained  
 firmen must live and work within 3    
 mins.  of the station. The present    
 fire station built 30 yrs. ago, where 
 they practice each Tuesday night, also
 contains the nuclear early warning    
 system. For over 50 years there has   
 been a tradition of family involvement
 and loyalty to the fire service by the
 men of Pebworth                       </content>
