		<title>15HOUSING IN THE SOUTH HAMS</title>
		<content>     Houses in this area are expensive 
 because it is considered a good place 
 to live.Prices start from about       
 Â£30,000 for quite a small house.There 
 are 5 big houses owned in the past by 
 the gentry:Gnaton Hall and Puslinch   
 (both still private);Alston Hall and  
 The Laurels,now a luxury hotel and a  
 country club and built arond 1900 by  
 the same architect;and Membland,parts 
 of which are very old and is now      
 divided into flats.Some of the farm   
 houses are several hundred years old  
 as are some of the cottages once      
 "tied" to them.But there are more     
 recent developments,too.At            
 Battisborough Cross bulding began in  
 1961 and continued into the 1970's.   
 Collaton Park near Newton Ferrers was 
 an RAF station and now the houses are 
 being modernised and sold privately.
