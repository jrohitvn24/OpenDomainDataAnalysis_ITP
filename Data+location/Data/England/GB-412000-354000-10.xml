		<title>10Tourists in Alstonefield</title>
		<content> In our area there are lots of         
tourists, especially in the summer.    
They come through Alstonefield and go  
down the road towards Milldale, then   
walk along the river, but first they   
call in the public house, The George or
The Watts Russell, to have a bar snack 
and a drink.  Some go into the cafe for
a cup of tea.                          
                                       
{Campers in Alstonefield}              
     Campers from all over the world   
come to camp in the fields.  Some are  
quite nice but some are bad and leave  
tin cans, on which animals may cut     
their feet, around.  They stay, at the 
most, for two weeks, but most of them  
stay for about one week.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
