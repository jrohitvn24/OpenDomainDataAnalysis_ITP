		<title>16Games we play in Kirkby</title>
		<content> My name is Sam and I like to play the 
 game called "Up and Down" in the      
 playground. This is how you play it.  
 Someone has to be the one who catches 
 you, he is called {man}. The other    
 people who are playing the game stand 
 in a semi circle that is already drawn
 on our playground. There are 2 of     
 these semi circles and they are part  
 of the netball pitch. The person who  
 is {man}has to call out somebody's    
 name and that person has to run ,     
 without getting caught, to the other  
 semi circle. If he gets there everyone
 playing can run to the other semi     
 circle and the person who is {man}has 
 to ask someone else to run. But if he 
 catches the one he is chasing, then   
 that person has to become one of the  
 catchers and chase the next person to 
 run. The winner is the last person to 
 be caught.                            </content>
