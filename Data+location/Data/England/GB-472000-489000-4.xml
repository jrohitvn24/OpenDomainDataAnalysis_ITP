		<title>04Cropton Village</title>
		<content> Cropton had a Norman castle which     
 commanded the entrance to Rosedale &amp;  
 later a part-timbered Hall. In the    
 churchyard are the remains of a stone 
 cross from about 1000 AD. The famous  
 whaler &amp; navigator William Scoresby   
 was born here &amp; in the 19th Century   
 one of the Morley family produced a   
 wooden, rocking washing machine now in
 the Pickering museum. Cropton was once
 an important centre for limestone     
 quarrying, used both as building      
 material &amp; for burning for lime. Along
 the wide main street the old stone    
 houses, some of cruck construction,   
 change outwardly only slowly. Most are
 modernised within. Today, newcomers to
 the village join the old established  
 families, some still farming. Modern  
 businesses include the post office/   
 shop, a livestock haulier, riding     
 stables &amp; a satellite systems company.</content>
