		<content> The tourist is a major factor in this 
 community.There are two holiday       
 villages in Downderry and two in      
 Seaton providing a total of 250 self  
 cater flatlets.In addition many       
 private houses are available as       
 holiday lets providing a further 100  
 units.Caravan and camping sites       
 surround the villages representing a  
 large but variable total.(approx 200) 
  Full board accommodation is rare.The 
 two surviving hotels having small     
 capacity.Bed and Breakfast facilities 
 are readily available in private and  
 farm houses.Thus large summer numbers.
  Amenities for the tourist are few.   
 There is a riding stable,and a small  
 specialist zoo in the D block.The sea 
 and the beach are the major attraction
 for the many holiday visitors from    
 other Cornish resorts and residents   
 from the connurbation of Plymouth.    </content>
