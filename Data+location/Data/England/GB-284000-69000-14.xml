		<title>14MY HOUSE</title>
		<content> I live in{Netley Road}in{Newton Abbot 
 and I really do like it. It is a      
 medium size{terraced house}and it is  
 quite old. It has three bedrooms a    
 kitchen, lounge, dining room, utility 
 room, one big hall and an extension.  
 The{garden}is small but just the right
 size we also have a{patio}where we    
 have deck chairs and a small table we 
 put a{garden shed}in about two years  
 ago and now, the cat sleeps in it. My 
 room is quite big and I have a sink in
 my bedroom. All{three bedrooms}are up 
 stairs. The{extension}was built about 
 two or three years ago and that is    
 now the{bathroom.}In our attic there  
 are birds nesting and they make a real
 racket. We do not have a garage, we   
 park our{Cortina 2.3 Ghia,}which is   
 really good, outside the house.
