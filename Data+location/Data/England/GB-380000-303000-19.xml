		<content> In Albrighton people are always       
 raising money for charities.Coffee    
 Mornings and Buffet lunches seem to be
 the favourite.The funniest item in the
 fund raising is the pram race which   
 takes place every Boxing Day.In this  
 the men dress up as babies and are    
 pushed around the village by their    
 wives.They stop off at each pub and   
 have half a pint of beer.All that's   
 made goes to Action Research.Also each
 year in the village we have an Arts   
 Festival,where people young or old    
 make some piece of artwork to be      
 exhibited.It can also be purchased.   
 Every year at the church we have a    
 music and flower festival where people
 play their music for other people to  
 listen too.This is very enjoyable.
