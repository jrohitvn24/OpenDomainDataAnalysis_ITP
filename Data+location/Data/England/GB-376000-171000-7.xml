		<content> HOUSING  Houses vary in age, size and 
 character; older ones, many listed,   
 are in the long main street. Some are 
 converted barns.  Most are owner      
 occupied, a few rented.  New detatched
 or semi-detached houses are           
 concentrated to the north and south.  
 Some houses are scattered in the      
 countryside.  Council houses, flats   
 and bungalows for the aged are to the 
 east.  The Almshouses of 1612 at the  
 west end are still in use.            
                                       
 HOME LIFE  Couples usually co-operate 
 in bringing up the family, and with   
 the help of labour saving devices and 
 electrical gadgets, parents are freer 
 to follow their own careers and       
 interests.  Many people keep pets.    
 Gardening is very popular.  Retirement
 at 60/65 with pension ensures a       
 comfortable life for the elderly.     </content>
