  The smooth skinned snake is a close  
 relative of the grass snake.          
  The smooth skinned snake's upper side
 is grey,brown or reddish with small   
 black,brown or red spots,which often  
 are in pairs,although sometimes are   
 arranged in stripes.It normally grows 
 to a length of about 18 inches.The    
 smooth skinned snake mates after      
 emerging from hibernation and then    
 looks after the eggs until they are   
 ready to hatch(about the end of       
 August).                              
  The smooth skinned snake can be found
 within this D block,basking on the    
 southern facing slopes.It feeds mainly
 on lizards(also common in this        
 area)but it also eats young snakes and
 slow worms and occasionally mice and  
 voles.
