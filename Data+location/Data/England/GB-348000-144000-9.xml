		<title>09The village of Yarley</title>
		<content>  Yarley is a small village with few   
 amenities. It does boast one          
 farmhouse, called Cross Farm, which   
 provides Bed and Breakfast.           
  Of special architectural interest is 
 a house called Axeover, so named      
 because it is actually built over the 
 River Axe. Strangely enough, even when
 the river is high the house does not  
 flood although the two houses opposite
 are often flooded by a combination of 
 river water and water running off the 
 hill. The house used to belong to a   
 blacksmith and the hot metal was      
 cooled in the stream. The present     
 owners of the house, Mr. and Mrs.     
 Robert Drake, have amalgamated three  
 cottages to make the present single   
 dwelling.                             
  Two other features of Yarley are a   
 small ford with stepping stones and a 
 sewage works.                         </content>
