		<title>09GRAVEL WORKING IN THURGARTON</title>
		<content>   The only{industry}in the block is   
 concerned with extracting the{gravels 
{and sands}deposited by the post ice   
 age waters.The current excavation is  
 on the outskirts of{Thurgarton}by     
 Tarmac Ltd.(who recently bought out   
 the nationally known firm,{Hoveringham
{Gravels).}The impression given is that
 there has been a slow down in the rate
 of extraction,perhaps reflecting the  
 depressed state of the country's      
 economy and low investment on roads.  
   Many worked-out areas are to be seen
 locally either in the form of{man-made
{lakes}or being filled in and recapped 
 with soil for return to agriculture.  
   A group of lakes in{Bleasby},called 
 the{Jubilee Ponds}is being preserved  
 and developed as a park for local folk
   A small off-shoot firm at{Thurgarton
  makes concrete slabs and pipes and   
 has recently developed a new flooring.</content>
