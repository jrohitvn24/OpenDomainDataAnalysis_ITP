		<content> The nearest Doctors' Surgery is at    
 Singleton which is 1 km from Charlton 
 and 2.5 from East Dean. The Surgery is
 held on two days each week, without   
 appointments. Prescriptions are       
 dispensed at the surgery. There is    
 always a doctor on call for           
 emergencies. Accidents are dealt with 
 at the hospital at Chichester and any 
 other form of treatment that is       
 needed.                               
 Dentists and Opticians have their     
 surgeries in Chichester or Midhurst.
