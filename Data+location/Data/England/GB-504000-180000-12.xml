		<title>12WEST DRAYTON AND YIEWSLEY</title>
		<content> The original Domesday Survey of 1086  
 shows that the parish of West Drayton 
 had 17 land owners,which sugests a    
 population of under 100.The total     
 value of the Manor was Â£6.The name    
 Drayton was originally spelt          
 'Draegtun'meaning a place where a boat
 could be draged over land.Yiewsley was
 originally known as 'Wiuesleg'meaning 
 wives wood.The 1981 census figures    
 show that the population of West      
 Drayton ward was 6439 and that of     
 Yiewsley was 6548.Over a thousand     
 years ago the earliest settlement at  
 West Drayton was probably stockaded to
 protect it from wild beasts living in 
 the surrounding forest.Today there are
 no signs of that forest although      
 because of its situation on the       
 western limits of London there are    
 wide variations of land use and       
 population density.                   </content>
