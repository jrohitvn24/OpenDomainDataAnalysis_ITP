		<title>02SITE OF AVERHAM</title>
		<content> The site of the small,select village  
 of Averham is in the flat Trent       
 Valley.It is four miles from Newark,  
 three miles from Southwell and twenty 
 miles from Nottingham.Averham consists
 mainly of expensive,private houses and
 tied cottages and the population of   
 189 is static because there has been  
 very little re-building for many      
 years.Thus the community consists of  
 mainly older people because people    
 with families find the existing homes 
 too expensive.                        
 The River Trent flows round the       
 village.The school,church and the     
 theatre are the only meeting points as
 the area has no shop or Public House. 
 All school occasions are well         
 supported.The church and the theatre  
 are built on the higher land and there
 has been no recent evidence of river  
 flooding in the Averham area.         </content>
