		<title>04Large Dairy Farm, N. Lopham</title>
		<content>      There are many large farms in our
 area, such as the locally famous dairy
 farm belonging to the Alston family,  
 about two miles outside North Lopham. 
 At present James Alston runs the farm,
 but it was started by his grandfather 
 in 1912.  The family own 1,130 acres  
 in North Lopham and use 210 of these  
 acres for grass for the herd. They    
 have built up the herd for 25 years.  
                                       
      The cows are Holstein Friesians, 
 which give a high milk yield.  At the 
 moment, they have 174 cows.  The herd 
 has got 10% smaller recently and is   
 unlikely to grow in the near future,  
 because of the quotas the Common      
 Market has put on milk production.    
 Mr. Alston thinks the dairy side of   
 farming helps balance the cereal      
 side.  He finds it a demanding, but   
 satisfying job.                       </content>
