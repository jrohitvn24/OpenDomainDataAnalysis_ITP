		<content>  Ruislip Manor is mainly residential, 
 with houses priced between Â£60 000 and
 Â£80 000. There is one main            
 shopping area where most of the       
 shops are small stores with single    
 frontage.                             
  The shops in Ruislip Manor were all  
 built in the 1930's, before which the 
 area was dominated by countryside.    
 Interestingly, apart from six shops   
 which have been running a successful  
 business for at least twenty years,   
 none of the remaining shops had been  
 operating under their current form for
 more than three years.This showed that
 no long-term business had flourished  
 in Ruislip Manor since 1965. Many shop
 owners put this down to the lack of a 
 large supermarket or chainstore in the
 vicinity. Many felt that if plans to  
 open a Manor branch of Sainsbury went 
 ahead it would improve their trade.   </content>
