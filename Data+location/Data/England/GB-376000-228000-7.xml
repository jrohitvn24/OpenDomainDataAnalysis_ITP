		<content> The headmaster of Corse C.of E. School
 is also the Vicar of Hartpury, Corse  
 and Staunton. Each church has a       
 service every Sunday, either at 8.30  
 a.m., 11 a.m. or 6.30 p.m. The times  
 change for each church every Sunday.  
 We have a family service in Staunton  
 at 11 o'clock on the first Sunday in  
 the month. There are usually 25-30    
 people at the 8.30 a.m. service,      
 almost 70 at 11 o'clock and 15 at the 
 6.30 p.m.service. There are no other  
 places of worship in our area but     
 there is a group who meet in a house. 
 Some people go to the Methodist Chapel
 in Hartpury; Roman Catholics usually  
 go to church in Gloucester.
