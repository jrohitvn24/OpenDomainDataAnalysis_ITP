		<content>When my mum goes to Indian shops she   
doesn't have any problems buying food  
and clothes.My sister or I normally    
help her when she visits English shops 
because she speaks very little English 
although she copes pretty well.We live 
in a semi-detached house with three    
double bedrooms upstairs.At home I     
speak Punjabi to my parents and English
sometimes to my sisters.We eat both    
types of food;Western food such as pie 
and chips;Indian food like meats and   
chappaties.We go to an Indian Temple on
Sunday about once a month.It is called 
Ramaria.There are Indian men at the    
front who sing songs and talk.My       
sisters and I understand some of it but
my mum and dad understand it all.
