		<content> During the last decade,religious      
 attendance at the{Parish Church}has   
 soared because{St. Mary's}has become  
 the mother church for 7 other villages
 around the area.There is now a team   
 ministery with a{Rector}and{Vicar.}The
 other churches are used but do not    
 support their own clergy.Because of   
 this sudden increase,the Church has   
 been made open for every generation   
 and now has a lively family           
 atmosphere.As the{local primary school
 is a{Church School,}the clergy play an
 important role in the welfare of the  
 children and the appointment of the   
 teachers.The hope is that in the      
 future there will be close cooperation
 between them all.
