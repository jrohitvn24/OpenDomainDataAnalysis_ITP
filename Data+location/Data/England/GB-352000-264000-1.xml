		<content> The block slopes gently towards the   
 north, and its southern ridge gives   
 good distant views of clee Hill,      
 Bringewood Chase and High Vinnals.  It
 is farming country, with small fields,
 hedges and many hedgerow trees.       
 communications are by a number of     
 narrow lanes, used by farmers'        
 machinary and by the local residents' 
 cars.  The village has no actual      
 centre; the houses and cottages are   
 guite evenly distributed over the area
 of the partish.  The church stands in 
 a fairly isolated position.  In recent
 years two large-scale turkey breeding 
 units have been established.  A number
 of the cottages have been renovated   
 during the past few years and are now 
 occupied by newcomers to the village.
