		<title>06LEISURE TIME IN DENTON</title>
		<content> One of the major complaints that the  
 young people of{West Denton}and       
{Danebank}have is that there is nothing
 for them to do in their leisure time. 
 In what is essentially first a        
 residential and second an industrial  
 area there may be some truth in this  
 complaint. There are no youth clubs   
 or similer leisure centres for the    
 young who consequently are left to    
 make their own entertainment. This has
 resulted in some vandalism as the     
 older residents only too readily point
 out. They complain of gangs of youths 
 roaming the streets disturbing the    
 peace of the area and causing trouble 
 with youths from other districts.For  
 the older residents it is easier to   
 find recreation in the form of a golf 
 ,publicparks,a public house two social
 clubs and a community centre.This     
 imbalance concerns all.               </content>
