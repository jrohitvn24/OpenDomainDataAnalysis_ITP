		<content>  There are two main shopping precincts
 in our area,{Headington}and{Marston.} 
{Headington}is the larger of the two.  
 Its facilities include fast-food      
 stores, video hire shops, opticians   
 and a furniture store, along with     
 those shops you would find in even the
 smallest of areas.There are four large
 supermarkets,and{7-eleven,}an American
 idea which sells many different items.
  A large proportion of the buildings  
 are banks, building societies and     
 estate agents. There is certainly a   
 lot of choice on how to get the best  
 value for saving money, but if you    
 prefer to spend it, you could have    
 your hair cut, hire a video, video    
 tape or a television, buy a computer, 
 have your eyes checked, buy yourself a
 pet, visit a restaurant or take-away, 
 browse through an antique shop or     
 place a bet on the days races!        </content>
