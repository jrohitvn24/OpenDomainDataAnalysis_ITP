		<content>  On Tuesday morning a lady came in to 
 talk to us about Health. Her name was 
 Mrs.Wadsworth, and she is our Health  
 Visitor.{The Wickersley Health Centre 
 was opened four years ago, in 1981.   
  The Health Centre has 4{Doctors}who  
 are called General Practitioners.     
  The Health Centre has a{District     
{Nurse}who looks at peoples ears and   
 stitches. If you are pregnant a       
{Midwife}looks after you and, once your
 baby is born, she will visit each day 
 until it is 10 days old.              
  At our school, which is called       
 Flanderwell Junior and Infant School, 
 there is a{School Nurse}called Miss   
 Robinson. She comes in regularly to   
 inspect our hair.She gives us hearing 
 and eye tests. Sometimes she sends you

 in once a year to do dental screening.
