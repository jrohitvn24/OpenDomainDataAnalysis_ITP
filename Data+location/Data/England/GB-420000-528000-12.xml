		<title>12HENKNOWLE PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content>{The school} was built in {1972,}in    
 very nice surroundings, for the       
 Henknowle Estate. It looks modern,    
 with a flat roof (renewed in 1983!),  
 large windows and part pebble-dash,   
 part tiled walls.                     
 It has three open-plan{classrooms} in 
 the infant part and 4 in the juniors. 
 In each classroom is a reading part   
 with benches and a carpet. The hall in
 between is used for games, assembly   
 and dining. There is a television and 
 library room, a kitchen and offices.  
 We have a{playground}and a{playing    
{field}with trees round the edge. When 
 the by-pass is finished the field will
 be extended and we will hve a         
 footbridge across the road.           
 There are 97{children}aged 4-11, 4    
 teachers and a headmaster. A playgroup
 for younger children meets in one of  
 the infant rooms each morning.        </content>
