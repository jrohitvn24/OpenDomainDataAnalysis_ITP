		<title>14WEST READING CARNIVAL</title>
		<content> This year our school chose "WIZARD OF 
 OZ" as our theme. I went as Dorothy.I 
 wore a flared pink dress and red      
 shoes.Onthe front of the float we had 
 a coloured rainbow with birds flying  
 over it.We waited outside the cattle  
 market,Great Knollys Street,for the   
 other floats and the police.And all   
 the time it was raining!we set off    
 like drowned rats but we didn't mind. 
{The carnival queen}didn't mind either.
 We went down roads in West Reading and
 all the time people were waiting and  
 taking photographs.The steel bands    
 played and everyone blew whistles as  
 loud as they could so they nearly     
 deafend you.We went along the Oxford  
 Road to the big roundabout.We danced  
 until we got to Wilson Road and we    
 still could hear the music playing.
