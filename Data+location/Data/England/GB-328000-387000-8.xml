		<content>     Great concern  was  shown by      
 adults for unemployed young people.   
 "Youngsters  have to move away to seek
 work. Many of those remaining get into
 trouble  through  boredom  and take to
 drugs and thieving."                  
 "Public houses  are being re-styled to
 appeal to young people and there is an
 increase in under-age drinking."      
   A lack of certain leisure facilities
 was highlighted in our survey.        
 "No  leisure  activites  left  for the
 young because of the closure of public
 baths in  Livingstone st.  Local parks
 are unsafe, no park police, play areas
 dominated by bullies and vandalised." 
   People  applauded  the  provision of
 some  leisure  centres  but  regretted
 having to travel long distances.  This
 is the only way to have a swim. School
 children  are  bussed to  Wallasey for
 swimming instruction.                 </content>
