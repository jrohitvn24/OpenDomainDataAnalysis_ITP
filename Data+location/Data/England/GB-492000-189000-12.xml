		<title>12Dormitary Town</title>
		<content> Beaconsfield,a dormitory town,is in a 
 very desirable residential area.It    
 lies on the edge of the green belt    
 with quick rail and road transport to 
 London for commuters.The Old Town,a   
 former coaching town has many fine    
 Georgian and pre-Georgian houses      
 -mainly terraced- and is now a        
 conservation area.The new town grew   
 after the railway came in 1906 when   
 large Edwardian houses were set       
 spacious gardens.Although most houses 
 are owner-occupied,there are some     
 council estates with semi-detached and
 terraced houses,some having been      
 recently sold.Houses for private rent 
 are rare;the purchase prices ranging  
 form Â£40,000 to Â£500,000 make         
 accomodation expensive.A four         
 bedroomed detached house sells for    
 Â£100,000 so that limits the choice for
 newcomers from cheaper housing areas. </content>
