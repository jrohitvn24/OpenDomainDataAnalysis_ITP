		<title>18HOME LIFE AROUND SHALBOURNE</title>
		<content> Shalbourne still has its own shop,    
 pub, garage and church, but except for
 the latter each is the only one for   
 three miles. Families shop locally for
 daily needs but tend to visit shops in
 nearby towns for bulk buying. About   
 70% have{freezers}for convenience     
 foods and bulk, home-prepared items.  
{Many women work.}All houses have      
{running water}from farm wells or the  
 Water Authority. All have{electricity.
 Only bottled gas is available.{Heating
 is mainly oil or coal but logs are    
 available.{Gardens}average 0.1 ha. The
 village hall/clubs provide facilities 
 for games and drama.{Audio/television,
 live or recorded, are in most homes.  
 Probably one house in three has a{dog 
 and similar number a{cat,}though in a 
 pheasant-shooting area cats are not   
 popular. Several people keep{horses}or
 ponies as grazing is available.       </content>
