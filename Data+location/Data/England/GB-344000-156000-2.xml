		<title>02Shipham Village.</title>
		<content>  In 1790 Shipham had 73 buildings     
 housing  380 inhabitants, nearly all  
 miners "in the street, in the yards   
 and some in the very houses."   In    
 1980 Shipham had 400 houses and 1046  
 inhabitants.  In recent years Shipham 
 has become a place of residence for   
 more and more people who work in      
 Bristol and Weston.                   
 New houses have been built in several 
 roads and a four bedroomed house with 
 a garden costs around Â£70,000.        
  However the village retains some old 
 mining characteristics.  An irregular 
 network of narrow lanes wind through a
 number of sternly grey cottages.      
  Its Church, St.Leonard's, is a       
 Victorian building with an octagonal  
 tower and a partly carpetted interior.
 Its present font cover was made from  
 the massive oak door to the original  
 Church, which was pulled down in 1840.</content>
