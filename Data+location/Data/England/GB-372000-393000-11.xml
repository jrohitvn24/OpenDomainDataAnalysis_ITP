		<title>11A DAY OF WORK</title>
		<content> Our family is a patient family. My    
 Mother Christine is a nice person. She
 has a lot of knowledge and is         
 especially good at maths. My father is
 better at English. My sister Andrea is
 ready to do anything. At the moment I 
 am nine and in the third year at      
 Wellacre Junior School. My Teacher is 
 Mrs. Drummond and the Head Teacher is 
 mr. Pears.  Each day I eat cornflakes,
 probably made in Trafford Park near to
 Proctor and Gamble, where my Mum works
 in an office. They make "Head and     
 Shoulders" shampoo and "Pampers" baby 
 nappies.  Once my Mum has gone to work
 my Dad gets up and we go to our       
 Grandma's. Dad then goes to work at   
 Shell Chemicals in Carrington and my  
 sister goes to Urmston Grammar school.
 I go to school at half past eight and 
 play with my best friend, Nicholas    
 Seth. His ancestors may be alive now. </content>
