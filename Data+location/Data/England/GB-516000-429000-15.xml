 Local events held on a regular basis  
 seem to have been largely concerned   
 with agriculture - the Hiring Fair    
 was held in November in the           
 neighbouring market town of Hedon.    
 Most farm workers in Preston were made
 to go to Hedon and there they were    
 either rehired or obtained another    
 position with a different master.     
 Scrimshanking, agreeing to work for   
 more than one master in order to take 
 the best was a problem.  The hiring   
 fair  went on for one whole week and  
 gradually deteriorated into a drunken 
 brawl as farm labourers and young     
 bloods took advantage of the Hedon    
 people.                               
 Local Sunday school outings have been 
 and still are a strong feature of life
 in Preston.                           </content>
