		<content> There are many food shops in          
 Stratford.We compared a large         
 supermarket with a small corner       
 shop.At the large supermarket called  
 Safeway we filled a basket with 24    
 products and added the prices         
 together,they came to Â£8.51. At the   
 small corner shop, Avon Dairies the   
 basket came to Â£10.76;a difference of 
 Â£2.25.                                
 Safeway:Safeway has been in Stratford 
 since September 18th 1984.About 120   
 people are employed there and their   
 turnover is Â£150,000 per week.The shop
 opens from 8.00am to 8.00pm daily.In  
 15 minutes, 73 people came to the shop
 Avon Dairies:A.D employs 3 people and 
 the turnover is Â£2400 per week.The    
 opening times are 8.00 a.m to 5.00 p.m
 daily.In 15 minutes only 6 people came
 to shop at Avon Dairies.              
 Safeway is much larger and cheaper.   </content>
