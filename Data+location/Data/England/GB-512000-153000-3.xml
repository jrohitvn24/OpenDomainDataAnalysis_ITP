		<content> Transport services have been cut;     
 there are fewer busses and trains, and
 the station is often unmanned. Private
 housing is built on every available   
 plot, but the village is increasingly 
 untidy with no regular road-sweeper,  
 poor road maintenance and serious     
 parking difficulties. Vandalism has   
 become a problem; especially at risk  
 are the churchyards bus_shelters and  
 telephone boxes.                      
 All this reflects the increasing      
 urbanisation of the area - more       
 private houses on smaller plots, more 
 shops including 2 supermarkets, and   
 more service functions. There are even
 a few small offices beside specialist 
 shops selling gifts, luxury furniture 
 and jewelry. Not all these ventures   
 have been successful - some have      
 closed, perhaps because of the recent 
 economic recession.                   </content>
