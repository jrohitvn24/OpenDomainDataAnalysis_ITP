		<title>02GENERAL LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content> Most of the area is part of the plain 
 beside the Severn but a promontory,   
 Knole Park with sides covered by scrub
 and trees  lies at the N.E. end and   
 dominates the area. An old tower and  
 flag_staff from the original mansion, 
 incorporated in a new house, crowns   
 the hill. At the foot of the slope lie
 the Brickworks' clay pits. Those still
 in use have red clay sides. Water     
 collects in the old ones and scrub    
 covers their sides. On the plain there
 are many coverts, small woods mostly  
 deciduous planted for protection. The 
 fields mostly grass are small with    
 trimmed hedges mainly hawthorn, elder 
 and recovering elms. Old pollarded    
 willows line some of the ditches.     
 Pollarding is also known as shrouding 
 locally. A railway embankment crossing
 the area is very obvious.
