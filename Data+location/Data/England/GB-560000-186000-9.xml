		<content>    Most of the farms in the area are  
 arable farms,because the fields are   
 fertile . There are a couple of mixed 
 farms. Most farms in our area are     
 quite small.                          
   The average number of people farms  
 employ is three.Not all are full_     
 time.This is because they use modern  
 machinery,such as: tractors,milling   
 machines and egg graders. Also they   
 use sprayers, ploughs, cultivators,   
 combine_harvesters, fork_lifts and    
 drills.                               
   Some farms have livestock and some  
 just have poultry .The crops grown are
 Barley, Wheat, Beans, Peas, Oil_seed  
 rape and potatoes.Most of the farms in
 our area grow the same crops every    
 year but the larger farms rotate their
 crops each year.The corn,wheat and    
 barley is sold to merchants and one   
 farmer sells locally.                 </content>
