		<content>   Our block is a rural area.  It is   
 all good farming land of various      
 kinds, which hosts many old buildings 
 containing vivid pasts and farms with 
 traditional farming people. The B5030 
 runs across our area, next to a       
 Victorian Post Box at Combridge, and  
 also the ruins of Crakemarsh Hall,    
 owned by J.C.Bamfords.The area hosts  
 many farms which are described, along 
 with Mince Pie Hall and Woodseat which
 was formerly a Garden Centre. The     
 Staffordshire Way is also frequented  
 by Hikers in our area. The River Dove 
 flows through the block, and the land 
 is undulating, but reaching a ridge   
 peak in the east at 500 m. A disused  
 railway track is also present across  
 the block. Abbotsholme Independent    
 School and its grounds are situated in
 the extreme east of the block, where  
 many foreign students attend.         </content>
