		<title>19THE CLAYPITS</title>
		<content> We went to visit{Ramsey Claypits,}a   
 few miles away.It was cool and misty  
 with a gentle breeze and the sky was  
 grey.There was a house called the     
 hopper and the bricks were coloured   
 orange, yellow, cream,black, white,   
 grey and brown. We went to look for { 
{minibeasts}and we saw a slug, snail,  
 an earthworm, an ant, a bee, a fly, a 
 hoverfly, a gnat, a daddy long legs   
 and a ground beetle. We did a bark    
 rubbing of a walnut tree and we saw   
 two baby owls in a tree. After dinner 
 we went{pond dipping}and looking for  
{wild flowers}and{mammal tracking}and  
{bird watching.}Then we went home.
