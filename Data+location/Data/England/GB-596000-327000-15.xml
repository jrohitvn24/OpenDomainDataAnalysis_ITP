 Most employment in the area is        
 agricultural but a few small          
 businesses operate. In Stibbard there 
 are two builders,R.Bunting and Son,   
 and A. Shreeve.  Mr.N. Curson runs a  
 light haulage business carrying sand, 
 shingle and other small loads. A few  
 metres east of Stibbard crossroads an 
 old Barn has been renovated and       
 operates as Brickfield Barn           
 Woodwork, specialising in hand made   
 furniture and churchwork.             
 Mrs. Susan Yaxley prints local history
 pamphlets and headed notepaper on a   
 small home press.  There is also a    
 Master Saddler, Geoffrey Gibson, and a
 Painter and Decorator, Brian Mann.
