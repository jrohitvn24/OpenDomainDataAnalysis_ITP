		<content> The Hurtwood is an area of some 4,000 
 acres of privately-owned forest,around
 the villages of Peaslake,Shere and    
 Holmbury St.Mary.The public has right 
 of access 'for air and exercise'.     
 The forest is administered by The     
 Hurtwood Control, a voluntary         
 organisation, created in 1925.Its     
 functions include maintaining paths   
 and bridleways, clearing litter       
 and watching for outbreaks of fire.   
 Horse-riding is permitted but motor   
 vehicles are not allowed on the       
 Hurtwood.Trees may not be cut down or 
 wood removed by the public. No litter 
 is to be deposited or rubbish dumped  
 and no camping or caravan parking is  
 allowed without prior permission. The 
 main landowners are the Bray Estate   
 and the Albury Park Estate. Both are  
 engaged in commercial forestry,       
 producing Scotch Pine.                </content>
