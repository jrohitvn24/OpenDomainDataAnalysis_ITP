		<content>    In the north-west, despite the     
{urban development}and new road system,
 farming (both arable and dairy) still 
 takes place on a limited basis.       
    At the Rowditch site a large       
 expanse of{derelict land}has been     
 reclaimed by refilling with rubbish   
 and now forms a basis for a developing
 industrial estate. A new supermarket  
 is planned for this site as well.     
 Hazel Woods foods have an advanced    
 cold storage site for all types of    
 frozen foods. A consignment from      
 Sutton Bridge in Lincolnshire arrived 
 by truck at the time of survey. Also  
 on the site is a joinery specialising 
 in window and door frames. The        
 Macmillan group have a major printing 
 and distribution centre here and there
 is also a firm which dismantles cars.
