		<content>   On both days the weather was fine   
 and sunny though this has been the    
 wettest June for 20 odd years.        
   We came to the conclusion that      
 although Ansley has a fair sprinkling 
 of people from other parts of the     
 country most people have lived in, or 
 near Ansley, for most of their lives. 
   People who said their family had    
 always lived in the village, said they
 themselves had lived there from 3 to  
 257 years.I find the 3 years somewhat 
 disconcerting.Perhaps the pupils      
 didn't fill in the correct side?
