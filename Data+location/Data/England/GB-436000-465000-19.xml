		<title>19Schools in Boroughbridge</title>
		<content> Boroughbridge Primary School was built
 in the 1930's.It was built before     
 world war two.In 1939 a bomb shelter  
 was erected underneath the school     
 playing field.The school has          
 approximately 200 children and seven  
 teachers.It's built of red brick and  
 it's surrounded by playing fields and 
 a playing yard.The children start at  
 the age of four and finish at the age 
 of eleven before going to the high    
 school.                               
      Boroughbridge High School was    
 built in 1980.Now in 1985 there are   
 four year groups.It seems big to us,  
 compared to our school.Boroughbridge  
 leisure centre is attached to the High
 School so school children and the     
 public can use It's facilities.At the 
 moment there are four hundred children
 in the High School,children start at  
 the age of 11 and finish at 16.       </content>
