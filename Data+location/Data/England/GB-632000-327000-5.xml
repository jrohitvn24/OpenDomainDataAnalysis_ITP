		<title>05HONING WOODYARD</title>
		<content> On a freezing February 7th.1985 our   
 class visited Kenny Firman at his     
 woodyard in Honing. We entered the    
 workshop and it was a pleasure to get 
 out of the biting wind. A local       
 farmhouse is being rethatched and Mr. 
 Firman was busy making liggers and    
 brotches from hazel billets harvested 
 locally at Beeston St. Lawrence.      
 Brotches are used to hold the thatch  
 in place and liggers for making the   
 patterns in diamonds and squares along
 the ridge thatch. Mr. Firman was      
 sitting astride a wooden stool with a 
 wooden peg protruding up at the far   
 end. He used a billhook to firstly    
 split the end of the hazel and then   
 skilfully pushed the split end against
 the peg thus splitting the hazel along
 its length. Honing Estate, the        
 landlords,want to move the woodyard to
 another site in the village.          </content>
