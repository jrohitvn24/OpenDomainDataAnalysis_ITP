		<title>05B.M.X. TRACK IN ANSTEY.</title>
		<content> A B.M.X is a type of bicycle specially
 designed for doing stunts such as     
 wheelies.  A wheelie is where you lift
 wheel up and ride along.  The bike has
 got thick tyres for better grip and   
 stability.  At the Martin High School,
 Anstey there is a B.M.X. track.  It   
 has two quarter pipes, a red one and a
 white one.  A quarter pie is is a ramp
 that goes up at 50 degrees in the air.
 There are lots of tricks you can do on
 it.  It is about 2 metres high. There 
 are lots of different kinds of B.M.X. 
 bikes.  The main makes include        
 Raleigh, Mongoose, Diamond Back and   
 Kuwahara.  The differences between    
 freestyle racing and racing is that   
 freestyle is stunts and racing is     
 racing around a B.M.X track.
