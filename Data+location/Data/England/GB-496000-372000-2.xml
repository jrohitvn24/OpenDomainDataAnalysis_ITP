		<content> The leisure facilities are very good  
 in the area.  There is a leisure      
 centre with a swimming pool, a running
 track and lots of inside facilities.  
 There are 3 housing estates, the      
 Ermine Estate, St. Giles and Glebe    
 Park.  Glebe Park is still being      
 built.  There is one pub on the estate
 but no shops.  They are going to build
 an adventure park on the estate but no
 one knows when it is going to be      
 built.  There is a museum called the  
 Lincolnshire Life, it has a room where
 displays have been put up of peoples  
 collections.  There is also a windmill
 there which you can go round.  In     
 Bailgate there is a Roman well which  
 has been dug up and there is Newport  
 Arch which is the only Roman arch     
 which cars can still go under in      
 Britain.
