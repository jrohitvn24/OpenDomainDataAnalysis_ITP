		<content>      In 1802 James Noakes built the   
 mill and his family owned it for 49   
 years.   Then the Abraham family owned
 it.   In 1934 Mr W.H. Simmons died and
 then Essex County Council planned to  
 demolish it.   Many people were       
 against that idea. The London Borough 
 of Havering own it now.               
      After the Second World War some  
 local residents and an old millwright 
 restored it.                          
      There are four floors and their  
 names are the dust floor, the bin     
 floor, the meal floor and the gallery.
      The local historical society give
 visitors guided tours.   If you are on
 the top floor on a clear day you can  
 see the tallest buildings in the city 
 of London.
