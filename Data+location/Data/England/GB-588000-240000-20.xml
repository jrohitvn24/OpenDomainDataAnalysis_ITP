		<title>20Local News in Cornard.</title>
		<content>A start has been made on the Sudbury   
By-pass. It will allow traffic from    
Bury to join the Colchester\Ipswich    
road and vice versa without having to  
negotiate the busy,narrow and conjested
town centre of Sudbury. The by-pass    
which goes through the Industrial      
Estate will join the A134 Bury Rd. just
before Long Melford and the A134       
Colchester Rd. near the entrance to the
Chilton Industrial Estate where there  
will be a roundabout linking it to     
Cornard's Northern Rd. The Cornard     
council has recently made the          
village a nuclear free zone  and said  
that Sudbury's Lord Mayor musn't wear  
his  chain of office in Cornard not    
being  Cornard's first citizen. The    
Country Park along Blackhouse Lane has 
been planted with trees and will soon  
be able to receive visitors
