		<content> This area on the outrskirts of {      
{Middlesbrough }consists mainly of     
 dense housing. The horizon is         
 dominated by a stark contrast the {   
{Eston Hills}, which re used by many of
 the residents for a variety of leisure
 activities, such as walking, motor    
 bike scrambling, picnicing, etc.      
   The housing is mainly council       
 properties of various styles and      
 ages.The older properties have been   
 modernised and many have been bought  
 by the residents.                     
   The area is heavily affected by {   
{unemployment }and the descriptuons of 
 the "flavour of life" reflect the     
 affects redundancy has had on many    
 families and communities.             
   We can only hope prospects improve  
 for all.
