		<content>THE MAIN PETS IN FILGRAVE ARE CATS &amp;   
DOGS.THERE ARE ALSO HORSES,MR ROBESON  
WHO OWNS A STALLION THAT WAS IN THE    
OLYMPICS AND WON A BRONZE MEDAL.THERE  
ARE ALSO TORTOISES &amp; BIRDS.MY FRIEND   
OWNS A GOAT.THERE IS A NEW LADY IN OUR 
VILLAGE WHO HAS I5 DOGS, 1 POODLE AND  
14 PEKENESE,WHICH SHE BREEDS,SHE ALSO  
HAS 5 CATS &amp; 2 BUDGIES.THERE ARE ALSO  
RABBITS &amp; CHICKENS.IN THE VILLAGE THERE
ARE MORE ANIMALS THAN THERE ARE PEOPLE.
I THINK THAT IS BECAUSE PETS ARE       
COMPANY FOR YOU.THE MAIN PLACES WHERE  
THE DOGS ARE WALKED ARE IN THE PLAYING 
FEILD OR DOWN THE ROAD.THERE ARE NOT   
SO MANY PETS IN THE CITIES BECAUSE     
THERE IS NO PLACES TO WALK YOUR DOGS   
&amp; BECAUSE THERE ARE NOT VERY MANY      
HOUSES WITH BIG ENOUGH GARDENS.PETS    
CAN ALSO BE USED FOR SPORT BUT I THINK 
IT IS MEAN.SPORTS THEY ARE USED FOR    
ARE MOSTLY RACING.                     </content>
