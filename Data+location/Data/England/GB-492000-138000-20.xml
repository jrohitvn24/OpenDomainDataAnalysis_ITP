		<title>20OCCUPATIONS SURVEY</title>
		<content>  During the course of the Domesday    
 Survey we were able to make a survey  
 of parents' occupations, place of     
 employment and mode of transport used.
  Many fathers were employed locally in
 practical trades such as painting,    
 decorating,building,plumbing,electrica
 l work and gardening.Others worked in 
 the nearby towns in retail trades.Due 
 to the fast rail link to London,many  
 worked in the city,in offices.Some    
 fathers worked as far away as Bedford,
 travelling up daily.Private car was   
 the most popular mode of transport    
 used.                                 
  Many of the mothers worked locally in
 part time jobs such as cleaning,child-
 minding and serving in shops.Others   
 worked full time as secretaries,office
 staff and teachers.For those mothers  
 without a car,walking and cycling to  
 work were common replies.             </content>
