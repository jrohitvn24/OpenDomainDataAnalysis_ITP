		<title>03Brookmans Park Village Shops</title>
		<content>    There is a small shopping centre in
 Brookmans Park. We sent out a         
 questionnaire to local people to find 
 out if they used the shops. The survey
 showed the village used them regularly
 though most people used a nearby town 
 for their main shopping. Of the follow
 ing three types of shop_: food,       
 newsagent, non food_ we found that the
 food shop is the most popular.        
    What people would most like to see 
 in our village is a shoe shop, though 
 there were other suggestions. The     
 parking facilities were found to be   
 satisfactory by most people.          
    Though the shops are used          
 regularly, they are only used for odd 
 items not bought at the supermarket.  
 The village shops are used for        
 convenience shopping as prices tend to
 be higher in the village than in a    
 supermarket.                          </content>
