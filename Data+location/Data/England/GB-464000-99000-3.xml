		<title>03Portsmouth South By-Election</title>
		<content>   In 1979 the Conservatives won       
{Portsmouth North}and{South},and still 
 control the City Council. In the 1984 
 by-election{Portsmouth South}surprised
 many by electing{Mike Hancock (SDP).  
   Why were the major parties rejected?
 The{Tories}defeated themselves: the   
 government had announced plans to     
 close the naval dockyard, while their 
 candidate from London seemed not to   
 know the difference between Portsmouth
 South and Portsmouth North. Disaster  
 struck{Labour.}Its national leadership
 was in disorder, as was the local     
 party since many of the leaders had   
 joined the SDP.                       
   Mr.Hancock says he was elected      
 because others lost. But many saw it  
 as a victory for{the popular local man
 who knew his city well.
