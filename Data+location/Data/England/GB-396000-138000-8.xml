		<title>08  Codford by pass</title>
		<content>  When the by pass is started in 1986  
 it will take about two years to build.
 The by pass will go across a field    
 near Ashton Gifford House. My dad said
 that they will change the drive so it 
 will lead to the by pass.The amount of
 traffic will be cut considerably. The 
 northern route was dropped because it 
 was over the ministry of defence land 
 and the route would have been longer  
 and would have involved the cutting   
 into the sides of hills ,it  would not
 have effected so many people. Codford 
 will be a safer place for pedestrians,
 cyclists and residents who have to get
 their cars out of garages.The houses  
 on the main street will suffer less   
 structural damage and the value of the
 properties will rise.
