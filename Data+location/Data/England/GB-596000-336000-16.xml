		<title>16LIFE STYLE.</title>
		<content>  In the village there are several     
 strata in which life styles differ    
 considerably. Styles are based on the 
 background, education, and financial  
 status of the residents. A few        
 residents live in London where they   
 are in business and spend their       
 weekends in the village.              
  The majority  of the older residents 
 live in a simple practical way. Those 
 who have worked on the land always had
 their lifestyle determined by low     
 wages and hard labour. They have a    
 realistic view of the limits of       
 country life.                         
  New residents often have a romantic  
 ideal of country life but they tend to
 still live as they would in town.     
  The young are building new life      
 styles often based on ideas gleaned   
 from magazines and television. None of
 these groups have much in common.     </content>
