  Both village schools are Church of   
 England and both also provide a Sunday
 school.Newborough school has a        
 Sunshine group for children which is  
 mainly learning about the Bible.      
  Each month,Brownies,Cubs and Scouts  
 have a parade at Newborough church.   
  Instead of old fashioned church bells
 Newborough church has modern loud     
 speakers with pre-recorded bell tolls 
 for services.At Christmas time the    
 loud speakers play carols around      
 Newborough all Christmas eve.The      
 church yard is being renovated,grave  
 stones being straightened,shrubs      
 being pruned and lawns renewed.       
  The vicar died a few months ago.The  
 new vicar is young and the villagers  
 expect change.
