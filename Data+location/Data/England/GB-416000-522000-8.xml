		<title>08MY DAD'S BUSINESS</title>
		<content> My dad has had a business which has   
 been passed down through families for 
 years.  It has gone from grandparent  
 to parent to sons.  My grandparents   
 business started with steam traction  
 engines and repairs.  They had two    
 Threshing engines ,a Fowler ,a Burrell
 and two threshers ,all driven         
 by steam.  Later on when petrol and   
 paraffin was invented ,tractors came  
 into use.  The tractor used was a{    
{Foddson Major.}This was used for      
 threshing.  Later on a roller was     
 bought to roll roads.  Today we use   
 J.C.B's.  A J.C.B is a digging        
 machine. It has a back bucket which   
 digs foundations, and a front bucket  
 is used for leveling out top soil.    
 The width is 8 foot and the length is 
 12 foot.  It weighs about 2-4 tonnes. 
 We now have 2 of these J.C.B's.
