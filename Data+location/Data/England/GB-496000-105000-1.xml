		<title>01Walberton Village</title>
		<content>   The main settlement in the block is 
 the village of Walberton with its     
 associated hamlet of Binsted - both in
 the original Domesday Book.           
   Walberton is situated on the West   
 Sussex coastal plain in the prosperous
 south of Britain. It is a well-kept,  
 quiet and unspoilt village, helped by 
 being off a main road. It has won the 
 best kept village competition three   
 times in recent years.                
  The surrounding area is mainly       
 agricultural or woodland. It is a very
 pleasant place to live with many      
 attractions nearby, e.g.the coast, the
 South Downs, the towns of Arundel and 
 Chichester and Barnham mainline       
 station one mile away.                
  Hence it is a much sought after      
 village with house prices being       
 relatively high for the area.
