		<content>  Sheppey's most famous legend is based
 on the story of Robert de Shurland    
 whose statue is in Minster Abbey.     
 Robert de Shurland, riding on the     
 beach one day,met an old woman who    
 foretold that de Shurland would be    
 killed by his own horse.De Shurland   
 promptly killed the horse,after which 
 he forgot the matter.Many years later,
 whilst on a walk,he absent mindedly   
 kicked a bone lying on the ground.The 
 bone,which was in fact that of his old
 horse,stuck in his foot which went    
 septic causing his death.             
  Another story is about an ancient    
 pagan spirit whose image is carved    
 above a door inside the Abbey. This   
 spirit,The Green Man,is half man and  
 half tree,and if any unwary traveller 
 should sit beneath a tree that is     
 actually The Green Man,he is never    
 seen again.     Laurence Hayes.       </content>
