		<title>05RECREATION IN ORPINGTON</title>
		<content>To meet the recreational needs of the  
people of {Orpington}, the {Walnuts    
Sports Centre} was built. The          
facilities it offers include a         
swimming pool,squash courts,           
gymnasium, snooker room, two sports    
halls for badminton, basketball and    
indoor hockey, plus a bar and          
cafeteria. The centre has also been    
used to hold national sporting events  
and people who live over 10 miles away 
from Orpington come to use its         
facilities.                            
There is a strong feeling that there   
is very little for the {youth of       
Orpington} to do in the evenings. The  
local {cinema} has closed and there    
are very few {youth club}s or {activity
centres} which young people can use.   
This has led to an increase of visible 
{vandalism} and graffiti around the    
town itself.                           </content>
