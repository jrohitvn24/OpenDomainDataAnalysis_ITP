		<title>15LOCAL HISTORY 1945</title>
		<content> There were few changes between 1925-45
 due to a shortage of money and the    
 advent of{World War 2}The two mills   
 were closed and the machinery sold for
 scrap.During the war the young were   
 coscripted and others went into the   
 valley to work.A {decoy town}was built
 on Manshead Moor and lit up to attract
 the German bombers.By 1945 {          
{electricity }had arrived at the Day   
 School premises.The small outlandish  
 farms became vacant and derelict.Fewer
 Irish labourers came as horse drawn   
 grass cutting machines were used above
 the valleys on the flatter land.There 
 was{very little social life}The       
 church,the working men's clubs and the
 public houses were still important as 
 focal points.Many homes had {wireless}
 sets run by accumulators.
