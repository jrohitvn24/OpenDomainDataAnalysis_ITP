		<content>{Joseph Whitaker,born in 1850}lived at 
 Rainworth Lodge,a beautifully situated
 house with historic connections.      
 Throughout his life he was devoted to 
 the study of birds &amp; ,he was to make  
 Rainworth a sanctuary for them. The   
 house nestles in a small wooded       
 valley with Rainworth Water running   
 down from Fountaindale, having been   
 widened into a small lake to attract  
 the water fowl.Behind the house       
 Whitaker created his bird walk-an acre
 of woodland,beyond which he made a    
 deer park with Japanese deer.         
 Rainworth Lodge housed Whitaker's     
 famous bird collection;mostly British 
 &amp; containing many rarities,especially 
 albinoes.He contributed to the        
 Victoria County History.He belonged to
 the Royal Zoological Society.The local
 Comprehensive school perpetuates his  
 name.                                 </content>
