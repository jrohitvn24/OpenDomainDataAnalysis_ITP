		<title>17A Nuneatonian reflects...</title>
		<content>  I have lived in{Stockingford}since I 
 was married 18 years ago. In that     
 time, apart from new schools and      
 several housing estates it hasn't     
 changed very much.                    
  As far as{amenities}are concerned    
 there has been little to improve the  
 area at all, most of the changes      
 taking place in the town centre! In   
 fact speaking as a parent I think the 
 lack of facilities in Stockingford is 
{pretty grim}as far as the children are
 concerned. On the other hand, the one 
 good thing it does have going for it  
 are the two new schools,{Croft}and    
{Glendale.                             
  I don't think pedestrians have been  
 taken into account enough, especially 
 the elderly, with far heavier traffic.
 We do have some good facilities in    
 Nuneaton itself but on the whole I    
 prefer Nuneaton as it was.            </content>
