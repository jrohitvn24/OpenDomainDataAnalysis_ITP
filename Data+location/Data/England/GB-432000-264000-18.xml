		<title>18OFFCHURCH BURY.</title>
		<content>   Offchurch Bury, the old manor house 
 near Offchurch village, is the private
 dwelling of Mr &amp; Mrs Henry Johnson,   
 who have lived there since the early  
 1920's. Mr Johnson, a keen            
 conservationist, runs the farm with   
 the help of a farm manager.           
   The house was once given to one of  
 Henry VIII's commissioners responsible
 for supervising the dissolution of the
 monasteries in this area.             
   Local legend has it that another    
 house on the same site served for a   
 palace for Offa, king of Mercia, who  
 is buried in a stone coffin in the    
 nearby church.                        
   During excavation for a swimming    
 pool a few years ago, the remains of  
 eleven bodies were found in the       
 medieval foundations.
