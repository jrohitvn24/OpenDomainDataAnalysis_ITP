		<content>This is a most interesting area,both   
scenically and in terms of human       
activity.The landscape varies from east
to west mainly under the influence of  
geology and the River Otter.East       
Budleigh and Bicton Commons to the west
form the highest land and the Otter and
its extensive flood-plain on the east  
the lowest points. The land use is     
mainly agricultural with pasture in a  
belt along the river and arable towards
the commons. East Budleigh is the      
largest and only village, Yettington is
a hamlet and the remaining settlements 
are farms. Bicton House is now an      
Agricultural College and its grounds   
form Bicton Gardens Amusement Park.    
Hayes Barton and Otterton Mill are     
other tourist attractions. The area is 
pretty and has a wide social mix.
