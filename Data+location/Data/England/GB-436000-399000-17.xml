		<content> Much of the{housing}in the Hoyland    
 area is council owned and of the      
 semi-detached type.The bulk of the    
 privately owned housing falls into the
 Â£10,000 to Â£30,000 price bracket which
 ranges from terraced housing to       
 detached properties.There is a new    
 development of housing in Elsecar     
 which contrasts with{Reform Row,}built
 in 1837 to house miners working in the
 local colliery.A programme of         
 renovation has been undertaken by the 
 council on a large number of their    
 properties to modernise them and make 
 them habitable well into the next     
 century.There is a history of mining  
 subsidence which affects some of the  
 houses in Hoyland and all new         
 properties are built on a concrete    
 "raft" as a precaution against land   
 movement.
