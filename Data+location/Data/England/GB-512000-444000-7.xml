		<content>      There has been a school at       
{Sigglesthorne}since the early 18th    
 Century. The present school building  
 was built in{1861}and since then many 
 additions and improvements have been  
 added. The latest improvements were   
 completed in 1984 when indoor toilets 
 and an assembly hall were created.    
      Children come to this school from
 the age of five and leave at the age  
 of eleven to transfer to secondary    
 school at{Hornsea.}There are{45}      
 children at the school with two full  
 time and two part time teachers.      
      Most children walk to school from
 the villages of{Seaton}and            
{Sigglesthorne}but some children are   
 brought from outlying farms by car.   
      The school at{Catwick}closed in  
 1923 but the children from Catwick go 
 the Leven school.
