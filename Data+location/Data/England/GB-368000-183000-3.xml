		<title>03A MOTHER'S DAY IN NORTH YATE</title>
		<content> I get up at 6.45am. I go downstairs,  
 make my husband's and Samantha's      
 lunch. My husband leaves for work at  
 approximately 7.30am. I go back       
 upstairs, get dressed, washed, and    
 make the bed. At 8.00am, I get        
 Samantha up, and get her clothes ready
 for school. I make her breakfast and  
 leave for school at about 8.40am. I   
 return at 9.15am. I have a cup of     
 coffee and look at the paper. I wash  
 the dishes, put on the washing, and   
 dust, tidy and vacuum. Then I clean   
 the bathroom and tidy the bedrooms. I 
 go shopping, and have lunch at 1.00pm.
 I read, then fetch Sam from school at 
 3.30pm. We get home at 4.00pm. I start
 preparing the evening meal, which we  
 eat at 6.00pm. I wash the dishes at   
 about 6.45pm, and sit down to watch   
 television at about 7.30pm. I have a  
 bath, and go to bed at about 11.00pm. </content>
