		<title>07MALTING END</title>
		<content>Malting End consists of a row of       
Council houses and several other       
houses and bungalows, mostly modern.   
It gets its name from the former GREAT 
MILL nearby, which was one of four     
corn-grinding mills in Wickhambrook,   
none of which is now in existence.     
Some of the Great Mill buildings are   
now used as a bakery and HQ of a fleet 
of electrically driven mobile shop     
vans. The Baker is a real expert and   
one of his specialities is baking      
harvest loaves for the three village   
Churches (United Reformed, Methodist   
and Anglican). M. End was once the     
"centre" of Village life for the Post  
Office and Bank and General Shop were  
all here (now Old Post Office, Bank    
House and Commerce House - this last a 
fine 3-storey thatched building.)
