		<content>      An important part of our study   
 area is known as Durlston Country     
 Park. It was established by Dorset    
 County Council with aid from the      
 Countryside Commission in 1973.       
      It consists of 260 acres of      
 unspoilt countryside for public       
 recreation. At the same time it is a  
 conservation area,containing a rich   
 variety of grassland, hedgerow,       
 woodland and cliff life; supporting   
 nearly 400 species of wild flower,    
 32 species of butterfly and over two  
 hundred types of bird have been       
 recorded.                             
      A large part of the Country Park 
 has been designated a Site of Special 
 Scientific Interest for its geological
 and wildlife attractions.
