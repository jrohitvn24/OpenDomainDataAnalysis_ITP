		<title>11Woodley Town Council</title>
		<content>{Woodley Town Council}has lots of      
 problems to solve. Every day          
 complaints come in. Vandalism,        
 accidental breakage, problems big and 
 small. Unfortunately the council has  
 to spend more of its Â£240,000 rates on
 repairs rather than new things. 1973  
 was declared{Plant a Tree Year.}The   
 last tree has now been destroyed.     
 32,000 people live in the area, 19,000
 ofthese being over 18. Sheltering     
 these people are roughly 11,000 houses
 with more being built. In 1956        
{Woodford Park's Coronation Hall}was   
 declared open by the famous{Douglas   
{Bader.}This meant many more sports    
 facilities were available. Another    
 Woodley problem is{Duffield Rd}where  
 it is planned to build a footpath     
 because of possible danger to         
 pedestrians. It has taken 15 years for
 the present stage to be reached.      </content>
