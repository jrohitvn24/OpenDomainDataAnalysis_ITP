		<title>19DOMESTIC PETS -THEDDINGWORTH</title>
		<content> The 80 households in our village seem 
 to keep a large number of pets, which 
 of course excludes farm animals. There
 are 53 dogs and 35 cats, 8 horses, 7  
 goats and a donkey. In addition there 
 are 5 birds in cages and 50 fish in   
 various tanks as well as a few rabbits
 and a hamster, and a hive of bees. A  
 number of households keep poultry with
 a total of some 60 hens and 15 ducks, 
 from which surplus eggs are sold.
