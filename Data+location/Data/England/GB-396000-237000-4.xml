		<title>04PARIS, ASHTON UNDER HILL</title>
		<content>   This hamlet, consisting of five     
 residences was probably a settlement  
 from very early times because of the  
 abundance of high quality water       
 arising from the many springs.        
   The name{Paris}dates from the       
 twelfth or thirteenth century when    
 a family named Perys or Parys lived   
 here. There is no French connection.  
   Mole Hill Cottage, an early Tudor,  
 half-timbered thatched structure is   
 the oldest property. Beauchamp House  
 was a mid-nineteenth century building 
 but is now fully modernised and Triona
 is a modern house built on the site of
 a small nineteenth century cottage.   
   Pear Tree Cottage was originally two
 eighteenth century Cotswold stone     
 cottages, now enlarged and partly     
 rebuilt in hand dressed natural stone 
 with Cotswold tiled roof.             
   Bredon Springs completes the colony.</content>
