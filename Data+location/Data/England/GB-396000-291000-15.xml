		<content> NOT LAST NIGHT BUT THE NIGHT BEFORE   
 Not last night but the night before,  
 24 robbers came knocking at my door.  
 As I ran out to let them in,          
 This is what they said to me.         
 Spanish lady{turn right round,        
 Spanish lady{touch the ground         
 Spanish lady{do high kicks            
 Spanish lady{do the splits            
 Spanish lady{go upstairs              
 Spanish lady{say your prayers,        
 Spanish lady{turn off the light,      
 Spanish lady{say goodnight.           
   When the rhyme says 'ran out' the   
 person skipping has to run out of the 
 skipping ring.                        
   When the rhyme says 'in' the person 
 skipping has to run into the skipping 
 ring.                                 
   The person skipping has to          
 performthe actions that are           
 highlighted in the above rhyme.       </content>
