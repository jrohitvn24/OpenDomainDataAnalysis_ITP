		<title>05TREES IN BRAMHALL</title>
		<content> Bramhall is especially nice in the    
 spring when all the flowering Almond  
 and Currant trees are in bloom.       
 Householders have planted these trees 
 in their front gardens to make them   
 look pretty and the council have      
 planted lots on the grass verges.     
 There are some very old trees in      
 Bramhall especially Horse Chestnut and
 Oak. These can be seen on the roadside
 from Stockport to Bramhall.In the     
 summer Bramhall Lane and Bramhall Park
 Road are alomst like tunnels with     
 trees arched above the road.Bramhall  
 Park has some very old trees          
 especially Beech,Oak,Lime and Yew.    
 Other large areas of trees are in     
 Carrwoods,Happy Valley and Bramhall   
 Golf Club.Most of the ponds have trees
 around them.Our school pond has two   
 very large Italian Poplars,but last   
 year in a gale one blew down.         </content>
