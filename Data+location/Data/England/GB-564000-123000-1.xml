		<title>01BURWASH VILLAGE</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
    Burwash is a pretty little village 
 set high on a ridge between the River 
 Rother on the North side and the River
 Dudwell on the South. The population  
 is approimately 2000 people.          
    By a fourtunate quirk of history,  
 the railway which was planned to run  
 through Burwash never materialized.   
 The nearest trains now stop at        
 Etchingham and Stonegate - each about 
 three miles away. Thus access to      
 London and some of the larger towns in
 the South-East is made quite easy.    
 Consequently, a considerable number of
 working inhabitants of the village    
 commute to work each day by train.
