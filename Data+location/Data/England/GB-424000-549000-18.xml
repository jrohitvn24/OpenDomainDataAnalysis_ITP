		<title>18THE ANKERS HOUSE PROJECT</title>
		<content> The Ankers House or Hermitage attached
 to the Parish Church is probably the  
 most complete example in England.In   
 the Middle Ages there were about 6    
 anchorages in County Durham and       
 hermits lived in the cell at Chester- 
 le-Street,walled up for life in prayer
 ,contemplation and fasting.They       
 watched Church services through a     
 squint hole.A scheme to restore and   
 convert the anchorage into a small    
 museum,costing Â£40,000 ,was started in
 1983.It is hoped to open the Ankers   
 House on St. Cuthberts Day,20 March   
 1986.To emphasise the project a small 
 housing development called the        
 Anchorage is being built nearby.
