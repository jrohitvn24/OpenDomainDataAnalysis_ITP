		<content> In my spare time on Monday nights I go
 swimming so does my brother. In my    
 Mum's spare time she goes to stoolball
 practice on Wednesday and on Thursdays
 my Mum plays a game of stoolball      
 against a different team.  On Fridays 
 my Dad goes down the pub and on       
 Saturdays my brother goes to football 
 practice and on Sunday he plays a game
 of football.  My Mum goes up and plays
 stoolball to get away from us for a   
 little while.  My brother plays       
 football because he enjoys it.  I go  
 swimming because I enjoy it.  My Dad  
 goes down the pub on Friday because he
 meets his friends down there and he   
 has a drink with them.
