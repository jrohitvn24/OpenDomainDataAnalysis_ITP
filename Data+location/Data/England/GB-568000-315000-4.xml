 Rev Bell was very pleased with the    
 welcome he had been given in the      
 villages. Everyone had been very      
 friendly to him and his wife.         
 He had many jobs to do throughout the 
 day. These included looking after the 
 two churches in Middleton and East    
 Winch, taking services in both        
 churches, visiting people in the      
 villages, going to the local Primary  
 school where he is also a school      
 governor and teaching people about the
 life of Jesus.                        
 Each week there are two  services at  
 Middleton and one at East Winch. The  
 chuirch at East Winch is very         
 interesting because behind the organ  
 there is a bible and a prayer book    
 which date back to 1745.
