		<title>18Religion in Whiston Village</title>
		<content>  In our village there is one church   
which was started in 1909 and was      
finished in 1910. 500 tonnes of stone  
was used for it, which came from the   
old copper works that was in the       
village. Also farmers lent horses and  
carts for  moving stone and people     
helped when they had spare time.       
  In the village is a school which was 
built in 1872, and before the church   
was actually built people used part of 
the school as a chancel. This chancel  
was built in 1891 so that meant that   
the school could be used as a church   
on Sundays.                            
  Over the other side of the road from 
the church is a chapel which was built 
in 1907 of brick, to replace a small   
stone chapel opposite.
