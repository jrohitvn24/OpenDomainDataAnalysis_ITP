		<title>01Round the Ridgeway</title>
		<content> Gentle undulating country, comprising 
 arable, grassland with sheep and dairy
 farms and mixed woods. The population 
 is mainy in three small villages, two 
 situated along the ridgeway the third 
 Coughton has an 150 yr old school and 
 many old buildings and houses. The    
 Ridgeway is a ridge at 120ft above sea
 level which also forms the            
 Warwickshire Worcestershire border,   
 and the highest point in the area. Two
 busy main roads dissect the area, one 
 following the Ridgeway, the other     
 follows a small brook in the valley   
 which has its source in a wood along  
 the Ridgeway. Numerous footpaths and  
 two bridleways go between woods and   
 farm land and away from the main roads
 the countryside offers a haven for    
 wildlife including deer, badgers and  
 a barn owl.
