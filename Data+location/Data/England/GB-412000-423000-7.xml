		<content> Boys and girls in 1985 like to choose 
 their own clothes. The most popular   
 shops visited by boys in my form are  
 TOP MAN, C.&amp; A. BURTON'S, DAILY       
 TAILORS AND FOSTERS. Some boys also   
 choose clothes from Mail Order        
 Catalogues. When boys go out shopping 
 for clothes, they normally spend Â£30  
 or less. They usually go to Halifax to
 buy their clothes. The most popular   
  colours amongst boys are grey and    
 black,not many boys like to wear very 
 bright colours. They do like to wear  
 expensive clothes, but this depends on
 what they are buying.Girls like to    
 go shopping at these stores: C.&amp;A.    
 WASIMS, BEST SELLERS, LEWIS'S MARKS &amp; 
 SPENCERS, CHELSEA GIRL, and BURTONS.  
 Mail order buying from catalogues is  
 quite popular   with girls. They go   
 to Leeds, Huddersfield, Halifax and   
 Bradford when they go shopping.       </content>
