		<content> We went for a walk in the {fields}to  
 see what {plants}there were. The field
 was large with untrimmed hedges and   
 trees.  There were a lot of dead      
 trees.  We thought that they had been 
 killed off by {Dutch Elm Disease.}It  
 was quite damp at the lower end of the
 field with a small stream running     
 beside the hedge.  Part of the field  
 was used by{cattle}and part was fenced
 off for{hay.}A massive raised water   
 pipe runs through the lower half of   
 the field. Under this it is overgrown 
 with newly seeded weeds because the   
 ground was chewed up by some machinery
 used for mending the pipe last year.
