		<title>04ST.JOHN'S CHURCH PEMBERTON</title>
		<content> The church was built in 1835 with     
 funds allocated by the government.It  
 was one of many churches built around 
 that time to celebrate the British    
 victory over Napoleon.The church was  
 built to serve a rapidly growing      
 Pemberton district.                   
                                       
 The gravestones in the cemetery       
 provide evidence of contemporary      
 social conditions.For example,there   
 are graves belonging to children who  
 died of Typhoid,Smallpox and          
 Diptheria.There are also graves of    
 miners killed at work which illustrate
 both the dangerous nature of the job  
 at that time and the connection of the
 area with coal.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
