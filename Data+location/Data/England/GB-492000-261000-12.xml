		<content>   There are some cottages and houses  
 in Podington and Hinwick that date    
 back to the 16th &amp; l7th centuries.    
 Most of these have thatched roofs.  A 
 lot of the more isolated cottages are 
 now empty and derelict.  There are a  
 few empty houses in Hinwick.  Most of 
 the houses date back to the 19th      
 century.  Some of the houses have date
 stones in the walls.  Near the school 
 there are a few council houses which  
 were built in the l930's  and some    
 built in the late l940's.  At the     
 bottom of Gold Street there are about 
 4 houses built since the fifties and  
 two more near  Corner Close. In       
 Hinwick there is a new bungalow.      
 Thirteen new houses were built in     
 Hornbeam Close in the l960's and a new
 police house was built next to the    
 school.  Lots of houses have been made
 bigger by extending or combining.     </content>
