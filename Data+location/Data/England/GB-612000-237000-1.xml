		<title>01SUMMARY OF AREA</title>
		<content>                                       
    The area we are studying is based  
around Tattingstone. It is mainly an   
agricultural region about 6 miles from 
the main population centre of Ipswich. 
    It has a scattered population of   
isolated farms and its main nucleus    
is the tiny village of Tattingstone    
which dates back to Saxon times and    
probably beyond.The church ,the school 
the hospital and the shop and post     
office are found here.It has a fairly  
stable population who are proud of     
their roots.It is an area in which one 
needs a car as the buses are few and   
far between and it is necessary for    
most people to leave the village to go 
to work or to shop.                    
     An important landowner in the     
area is the Paul family who own        
Bluegate Farm and Holbrook Park a      
private mixed woodland.                </content>
