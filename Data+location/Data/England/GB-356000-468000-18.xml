		<content>Some of the group wanted to make a     
survey of the types of employment which
their parents were engaged in. There   
are 49 families who have children at   
the Primary School and between them    
they have 27 different jobs. Farming is
the most common form of employment;    
nearly 25% are engaged in farming.     
Of the remainder, many commute to towns
and cities within a 50 km radius. The  
Irish Sea Gas Fields, the Nuclear Power
Station at Heysham and Lancaster       
University are significant employers.  
The jobs in which the parents are      
involved in were allocated to one of   
six socio-economic groups as follows:- 
 Professional  47%   Agricultural  22% 
 Managerial    16%   Sk. Manual    12% 
 Semi Sk.            Unskilled         
 Manual         3%   Manual         0% 
Unemployment is not a great problem in 
this area for which we are grateful.   </content>
