		<title>09LIFE IN CUCKFIELD-ELDERLY</title>
		<content>  After interviewing some elderly      
 people in Cuckfield we noticed certain
 similarities in their answers to 'A   
 day in the Life'                      
  They usually get up between 6.30 and 
 7.30am. Bedtime is governed by        
 T.V programmes, but is around 10pm.   
 Their usual times for breakfast, lunch
 and tea are 6.30am, 1pm and 5pm       
 respectively.                         
  Excursions are restricted by physical
 disability or a lack of transport.    
 However, some clubs like 'Silver      
 Threads' do provide the much needed   
 transport.                            
  T.V. is watched extensively with     
 their programmes either to do with    
 nature, documentaries or sport. Radio 
 is listened to very little if at all. 
 Hobbies range from gardening, knitting
 to making toy animals for social      
 services and attending whist drives.  </content>
