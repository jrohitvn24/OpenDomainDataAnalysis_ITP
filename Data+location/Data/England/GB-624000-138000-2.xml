		<title>02CAPEL_LE_FERNE _  ORIGIN.</title>
		<content>   There is no mention of Capel_le_    
 Ferne in the original Domesday Book.  
 The village church of St Mary's was   
 built before 1150 A.D.and gave its    
 name to the village,"the Chapel       
 amongst the Ferns."Through the ages   
 the name has been spelt in various    
 ways;in 1377 it was Capel-ete-Verne;  
 in 1381 it was Capelle-ate-Verne;in   
 1535 Capellin-le-Ferne and by 1569    
 Capleferne.Since then it has always   
 been referred to as Capel-le-Ferne.   
   In 1841 Capel had 50 houses and a   
 population of 247.In 1901 Capel was   
 still entirely agricultural with a    
 population of 231.The inhabitants     
 lived in cottages within the vicinity 
 of the church.These houses have now   
 disappeared and with the building of  
 the A20 trunk road a new village      
 grew up along either side of the road.
 Today's population is almost 2000. .  </content>
