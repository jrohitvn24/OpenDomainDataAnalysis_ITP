		<content> Our D-block has 2 medium-sized        
 villages - Howden &amp; Hunwick - and 2   
 small villages - North Bitchburn &amp;    
 High Grange.Howden has 1 Methodist    
 Church and 1 Church of England.The    
 Church of England is called St.Marys  
 and it has a cemetery across the road.
 Hunwick Methodist Church was built    
 in 1875 and St. Pauls Church of       
 England was built 1844..The Churches  
 hold services and Sunday Schools and  
 are also used to hold Chistenings and 
 Weddings.Church Attendences are       
 declining in this area and Churches   
 are closing.One Church in both Howden 
 and Hunwick have closed in the past   
 ten years.Once upon a time all        
 children went to Sunday School.       
 Nowadays very few children go.In      
 Hunwick the Methodist Sunday School is
 enjoying a revival.
