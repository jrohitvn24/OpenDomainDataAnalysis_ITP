		<content> Bildeston has a great variety of      
country town styles of housing through 
the centuries, the size and type of    
materials corresponding to the wealth  
of the village at that time.           
Most of the houses in the old part of  
the village, probably named Bildeston  
Street on the old Pedlar's way, were   
built in the late fifteenth and        
sixteenth centuries. The houses show   
various changes as the years have gone 
by, with the exposure of oak beams     
being a twentieth century style. Some  
overhanging beams were made flush by   
brick infill in the 19th century.      
The Georgian homes are of red and cream
brick with slate roofs. Only the slate 
needs to be brought far, as there were 
local brick works supplying all styles 
and colours. Later victorian buildings 
are on the whole smaller and not very  
memorable.                             </content>
