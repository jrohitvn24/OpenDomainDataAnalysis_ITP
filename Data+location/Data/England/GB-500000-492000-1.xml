		<content>  Coast rocky with 50-100ft high cliffs
 &amp; steep grass slopes leading to scenic
 and gently undulating farmland with   
 hills, overlooking the villages of    
 Cloughton &amp; Burniston. The main Whitby
 Scarborough road, as well as the long 
 distance Cleveland way footpath pass  
 through the area. Part is National    
 Park and with coast attracts some     
 tourists. The main occupation is      
 farming although there are several    
 caravan sites &amp; apart from these, &amp;   
 the main services of the villages, it 
 appears most residents commute to     
 Scarborough or elsewhere to work.     
 Close to Scarborough, the coast, and  
 the North York moors National Park the
 villages make a good base for         
 tourists, or residents with transport,
 although a bus service does operate   
 along the main A171 road.
