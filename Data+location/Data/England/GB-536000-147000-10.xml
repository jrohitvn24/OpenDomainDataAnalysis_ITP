		<title>10HISTORY OF SOUTH GODSTONE</title>
		<content>   In 1841 the{Dover and Chatham       
{Railway Company}opened the Redhill to 
 Tonbridge line. As a result South     
 Godstone grew around the Dover public 
 house, now known as the Railway Hotel.
 The village is within the old deer    
 park of Lagham Manor.                 
   Because of a growing population a   
 small schoolroom was built in 1869.   
 This was{Godstone Station School}which
 was made available for public worship.
 The station school was enlarged from  
 time to time as new residential       
 properties were developed.            
   In 1939 evacuees and their teachers 
 from Brockley shared the school with  
 local children. In July 1959 Godstone 
 Station school closed and a new Church
 School opened in Hunters Chase. The   
 old school became St.Stephen's Church.
