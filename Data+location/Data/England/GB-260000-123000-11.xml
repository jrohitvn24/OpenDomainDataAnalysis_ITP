		<content> RAILWAY STATION UMBERLEIGH            
 Umberleigh station is an open station.
 The daily trains from Exeter to       
 Barnstaple stop regularly at the      
 station. Some trains only stop by     
 request so you have to wave furiously 
 and make sure youre seen. 20 passenger
 trains and some freight trains go past
 most weekdays.                        
 The Station house is now privately    
 owned by the previous station master. 
 There is a small shelter to wait in   
 and the old ticket office is still    
 there.
