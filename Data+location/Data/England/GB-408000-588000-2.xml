		<content>   The land in the valley of the River 
 Font is primarily agricultural,       
 divided equally between arable and    
 pasture.                              
   There is one landowner, Raleigh     
 Trevelyan, whose family have lived at 
 Netherwitton Hall since 1770. There   
 are 10 tenant farms in this area.     
   The crops grown are wheat, barley,  
 oats, rape, turnips, potatoes,        
 peas(for the cattle), beans(for game),
 silage, and some hay. These are       
 brought in for the winter feeding of  
 the beasts.                           
    The beasts are brought into        
 cattleyards for the winter (to save   
 poaching the grass), and fed on       
 silagand grain. The resulting manure  
 is used to fertilise the fields,      
 together with artificial fertilisers. 
 Most of the farms have sheep, sold for
 meat, fleeces as secondary products.  </content>
