         There are three bells dated   
 1655, 1660 and 1705. The latter is the
 treble and contains the inscription   
 "Samuel Knight made mee 1705".        
                                       
         One of these bells has an     
 unusual history. In 1825 a cricket    
 team from Medstead played an away     
 match against West Meon. A member of  
 the team saw the bell lying in a      
 farmyard. It was agreed that the bell 
 would be the prize for the match, and 
 it was duly brought back to Medstead  
 and after being used for a few years  
 to bring in the labourers from the    
 fields was hung in the belfry.
