		<content>   The{houses} here in New Herrington  
 are mainly terraced or modernised     
 council houses which are made of brick
 and have been pebble-dashed.          
   There is a very friendly corner shop
 here. It is run by Mr Turnbull and his
 wife and has really low prices and a  
 wide variety of groceries, tins and   
 biscuits. It also sells loo rolls,    
 soap and those sorts of things. During
 the miners strike the other corner    
 shop in this area closed down.        
   Futher up the road there is a Post  
 Office. The{Post Office}is very handy 
 when you are short of a stamp or some 
 wrapping paper for a present. It also 
 gives you your{Giro}when you need it. 
   Herrington has very few amenities   
 for children, no clubs and very few   
 pubs. There is only the bowling green 
 and the football pitch.
