		<title>07ST.MICHAEL'S MOUNT CASTLE-2</title>
		<content> The castle has many old paintings and 
 prints of the Mount, which show       
 different times and events in its     
 history. There are many family        
 portraits and other fascinating items 
 collected by the St. Aubyn family.    
 These include a mummified cat from    
 Egypt which is 2000 years old. It may 
 be unwrapped in the year 2000 A.D.!   
                                       
 In the Church there is a low doorway  
 which leads down to a dungeon. When   
 first discovered this contained the   
 skeleton of a man seven feet tall. The
 dungeon is said to have been used as a
 punishment cell for the monks when the
 castle was a monastery. It was built  
 below the church so that the monks    
 could hear the services while they    
 were shut up in the dungeon.
