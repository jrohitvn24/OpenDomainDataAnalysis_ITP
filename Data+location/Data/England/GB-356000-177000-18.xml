		<title>18SOCIAL CONCERNS IN N.BRISTOL</title>
		<content> Many varied social concerns due to    
 dramatically different areas within   
 N.Bristol.Some families on large      
 council estate in Southmead exist on  
{poverty line}&amp; need help from welfare 
 state.Evidence of neglect in housing &amp;
 living conditions,&amp; high incidence of 
{vandalism,}petty crime &amp; gang         
 rivalry. Conversely in neighbouring   
 areas where the educational           
 expectations tend to be higher,the    
 social concerns are related to a      
 wealthier life.There are petitions for
 safer roads which are now inadequate  
 for increased domestic &amp; industrial   
 traffic. There is more charity fund   
 raising. All people are concerned with
 vandalism &amp;{glue sniffing}which is    
 more prevalent in poor areas.Much     
 graffiti-{"No hope without dope"      
 splashed across a recently closed     
 school.Drunk-driving causes concern.  </content>
