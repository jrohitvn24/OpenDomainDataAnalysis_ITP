		<title>06TREGONNING  HILL (1)</title>
		<content>{Tregonning Hill}is a large granite    
 hill mass which lies to the north of  
 the village of Ashton.It has had three
 distinct periods of human settlement  
 and activity.                         
                                       
         The probable origin of the    
 name {Tregonning}was from a chieftain 
 called {Connan}who lived on the hill  
 and {Tre}being a Cornish word for     
 homestead. This  has changed to       
{Treconnan}meaning "the homestead of   
 Connan" and, eventually, Tregonning.  
                                       
                                       
         Around 700 A.D. there was an  
 influx of Irish / Celtic saints. Among
 these was a St. Breaca who arrived    
 at Hayle and set up her first church  
 at Ttegonning Hill.
