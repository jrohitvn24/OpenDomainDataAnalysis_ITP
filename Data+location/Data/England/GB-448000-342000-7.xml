		<content>   Cossall is a hilltop village. There 
 is a church dedicated to St.Catherine,
 some almshouses and a cottage that    
 featured in{"The Rainbow" by          
{D.H.Lawrence.                         
   The almshouses were built by the    
 Willoughby family who became rich by  
 mining the local coal. They also built
{Wollaton Hall.}The church has a       
 memorial to some local men who fought 
 at the Battle of Waterloo.            
   The parish of Cossall spreads beyond
 the hilltop site and has farms and    
 fields within it. The village has no  
 shops or other facilities, but The    
 Gardener's Inn, considered to be in   
 Awsworth, is actually in Cossall.
