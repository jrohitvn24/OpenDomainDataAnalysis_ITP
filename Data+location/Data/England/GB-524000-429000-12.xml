		<title>12BURTON PIDSEA RIDING SCHOOL</title>
		<content>     Bramhill Riding School is owned   
 and run by Julie Sargeant.            
     She has 14 ponies and two horses  
 at present at the stables; the oldest 
 is 26 years old.  Some of the ponies  
 belong to the school itself for use by
 people requiring riding lessons.      
 Others are owned by local people but  
 are stabled and exercised at the      
 riding school.                        
     Pupils of the riding school learn 
 everything about the ponies, not just 
 how to ride. They have to groom and   
 tack up the ponies and learn how to   
 keep the tack clean too.              
     When we visited the stables Julie 
 showed us horses being groomed and    
 where all the equipment was kept. She 
 also told us how important it is to   
 feed the horses properly.             
     Julie was busy that day getting   
 everything ready for the Carnival.    </content>
