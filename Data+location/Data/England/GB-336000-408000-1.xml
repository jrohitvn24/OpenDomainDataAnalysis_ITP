   This block is an area on the edge of
the market town of Ormskirk, famous for
its Church with both tower and steeple 
and for its gingerbread and potatoes.  
The land, part of the Ormskirk Plain,  
is entirely Class I agricultural land  
with medium loam soil, artificially    
drained to give excellent farming land,
often yielding two crops annually.     
   From Clieves Hills, with their high 
point the Devil's Wall, Blackpool, 40  
km. away, can easily be seen.          
   Small copses of trees and drainage  
ditches criss-crossing the land are the
most noticeable features of the        
landscape.  The only dwellings are     
farmhouses and related cottages and    
barns.
