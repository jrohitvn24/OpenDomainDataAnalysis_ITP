		<title>07Overton Farm, Sway.</title>
		<content> This farm covers 130 acres of quality 
 grazing land near the New Forest. Mr  
 Charles Lance started farming at      
 Overton in 1939. His two sons now farm
 the land though Mr Lance continues to 
 take an active interest. Overton is a 
 dairy farm with a prize winning herd  
 of{Guernseys,}including 101 cows, 70  
 heifers and 3 bulls. One of the bulls 
 is currently at the New Forest Cattle 
 Breeder Association's headquarters at 
 Lyndhurst. The herd produces one of   
 the highest dairy yields in the       
 country. One cow, Lancewood Delia 10th
 holds the national record for the     
 highest buttermilk and milk yield. The
 cows are milked in a modern, fully    
 tiled, computer controlled herringbone
 milking parlour. This milk is         
 collected daily by a baulk tanker and 
 taken to Edgar's Dairy in New Milton.
