 lovely view of the hills, one of which
 is the{Wainstones.} At the Sports Club
 there are two tennis courts, a        
 football pitch, a cricket pitch and a

 through Gt Broughton the B1257 and    
 a small country lane. Around our      
 village there is a lot of country-side

 functions take place. Kirby has       
 a Parish church, with a vicar called  
{Rev. S.C.Nichols,}a few yards down

 and a post office. In Kirby there is
