		<title>06ST.MICHAEL'S MOUNT CASTLE-1</title>
		<content> The main doorway to the castle was    
 once the entrance to the monastery.   
 The{Chevy Chase Room}was the refectory
 of the monastery and may be 12th      
 century. The name comes from a plaster
 frieze of hunting scenes which goes   
 right around the room. It has a long  
 oak table and the chairs are models of
 those used by the monks.              
 The{Blue Drawing Rooms}are elegantly  
 furnished with blue upholstery and    
 curtains and have family portraits on 
 the pale blue walls.                  
 The{Church}was rebuilt in the 14th    
 century, following an earthquake, but 
 much of the ornamentation is modern.  
 Services are held each Sunday and the 
 church holds the Investiture of the   
 Order of St. John.                    
 There are many other buildings and    
 rooms including the{armoury.}
