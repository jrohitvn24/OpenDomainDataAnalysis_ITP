 Red deer and roe deer, inhabit the    
 coniferous forest. Foxes, weasels,    
 hedghogs, badgers inhabit the         
 farmlands, along with rabbits, which  
 are on the increase. There is a       
 resurgence of the red squirrel in     
 coniferous woods. Foxes are regarded  
 as a great nuisance on the farms and  
 there are 2 local hunts which cover   
 the territory, the Percy and the West 
 Percy. There are pheasant, partridge  
 and curlew on grassland and moorland. 
 The streams support small trout,      
 mallard, dippers and herons (no report
 of kingfishers). In the SE corner of  
 the block, there is a woodland area   
 covering 88 acres called Birsley Wood.
 It is used by the Local Education     
 Authority to show children a variety  
 of flora and fauna and instruct them  
 in conservation of the countryside.   </content>
