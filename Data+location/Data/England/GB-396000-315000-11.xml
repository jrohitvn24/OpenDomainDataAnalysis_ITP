		<title>11A Countryside Ranger.</title>
		<content>    We met a Stafffs.County Council    
Countryside Ranger. Four full time,    
 6 part time and about 30 voluntary    
rangers work in Cannock Chase Country  
Park, a popular place for visitors.    
    Because of the problems of erosion,
they have to keep vehicles to certain  
areas and so motorless zones and       
special car parks have been set up. A  
works unit makes the car parks and lays
out picnic sites.                      
    A regular Monday morning job is the
removal of litter which is both        
unsightly and a danger to wildlife.    
    The rangers work in conjunction    
with the Forest Ranger to control and  
manage the deer. Each year, many deer  
are involved in road accidents and a   
ranger is called out to check on       
injured animals.                       
    Another aspect of the ranger's work
is to devise &amp; mark out Nature Trails. </content>
