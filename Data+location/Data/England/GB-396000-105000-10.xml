		<title>10Witchampton Church</title>
		<content> The church is under the patronge of   
 the Hon.Mrs Marten and is dedicated to
 St Cuthberga, St Mary and All Saints. 
 None of the old church is left except 
 for the 15th century tower. It has    
 been said that the tower possibly     
 dates back to the 12th century.  The  
 tower clock dates from the early 18th 
 century.  Inside the church all that  
 remains of the old building is the    
 bowl of the font - this was found in a
 field being used as a cattle trough!  
 The pulpit is circa 1750 and there is 
 a fine East window by Sir Ninian      
 Comper.  The main church was rebuilt  
 after a fire and the South Transept   
 bears the date 1832.  The Chancel,    
 Nave and North Transept were rebuilt  
 in 1844 and the organ chamber and     
 vestry were added in 1898, the builder
 being H Story. The church and the     
 chapel are still part of village life.</content>
