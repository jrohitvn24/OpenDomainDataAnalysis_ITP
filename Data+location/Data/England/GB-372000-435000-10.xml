 by monks in about the 14th century.The
 school moved to the{Old Grammar School
 (now an{Adult Centre)}in 1725.In 1844 
 the village school was erected and has
 remained on this site until today.    
   A child living in Whalley might     
 start his education at a{Playgroup}   
 such as is organised at the{Old       
{Grammar School.}The child would be    
 about the age of 3 years.Here he would
 play with toys and be told stories.   
   At the age of 5 he would go to a    
{Primary School.}Whalley C.E.Primary   
 caters for 5 to 11 yr. olds.Here they 
 would learn to read,write and count.

 R.C. High.Many Whalley pupils transfer
 to{Clitheroe}secondary schools.       </content>
