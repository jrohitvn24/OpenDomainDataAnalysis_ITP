		<content> Modern large scale farming methods    
 need fairly large fields,and          
 consequently there have been some     
{hedges}removed in the area. However,  
 many trees have lately been planted in
 inaccessible field corners and        
 along roadsides, country pursuits such
 as{pheasant and partridge shooting    
 have undoubtedly encouraged the       
 preservation of wild life.            
 Good quality land coming on to the    
 market could be expected to fetch     
 around 7,000 pounds a hectare.        
 The area contains two Grain           
 Intervention Stores where surplus     
 grain is kept under the{European      
{Economic Community Common Agricultural
 Policy. The larger store holds 17,000 
 tonnes and the smaller store holds    
 10,500 tonnes.
