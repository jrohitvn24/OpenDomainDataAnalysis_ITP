		<content>  {Soham County Junior School,}called  
 The{Shade School,}is one of two Junior
 Schools in Soham and takes children   
 from the{Infant School}who live       
 mainly in the northern part of the    
 village when they reach the age of    
 7 years old. At the age of 11 children
 transfer to Soham Village College for 
 their secondary education.            
   There are 140 children on roll at   
 present and these are organised into 4
 classes. The main building is 110     
 years old,but a new extension was     
 opened in 1983, which houses toilets  
 and offices.                          
   The school sets high standards and  
 prepares children for secondary       
 education by teaching a broad,        
 balanced and continuous curriculum in 
 lessons and out_of_school clubs.
