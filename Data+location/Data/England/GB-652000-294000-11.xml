estate land.The grounds are for public 
use.You can enter the Sparrows Nest    
from the High Street or from the Ravine
or from Whapload Road.During the Second
World War the Sparrows Nest was a      
gathering place for travellers and a   
base for hazardous war duties.In the   
grounds there are two bowling greens   
and tennis courts.The grounds slope    
down towards the sea.The gardens are   
well kept by four council workmen.The  
Sparrows Nest is going to be           
discontinued as a theatre .The Marina  
Cinema has been bought by the Council  
and is going to be used as a theatre   
instead.
