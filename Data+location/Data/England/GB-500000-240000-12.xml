		<title>12STEWARTBY: CHILDRENS VIEWS</title>
		<content> Written by David Horn Aged 14         
 Once you have got up there are a      
 number of things you can do. Young    
 children go to the parks. One of the  
 parks is very old and is falling      
 apart, but the other park is much     
 newer and is therefore in good        
 condition.                            
 The seven to eleven _ year _ olds ride
 around Stewartby on their bicycles.   
 Most of them have BMX's (A popular    
 leisure bike for children) The other, 
 older age group mainly have motorbikes
 and they take them over to the fields 
 behind the main village where they    
 enjoy cross country motor races. If   
 you have not got a motorbike or       
 bicycle you can go to the village shop
 and hire a video to watch on the      
 television. If you have no video your 
 life in Stewartby can be very boring.
