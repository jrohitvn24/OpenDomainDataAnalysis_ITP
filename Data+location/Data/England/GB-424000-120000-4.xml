		<title>04Manor farm, Plaitford</title>
		<content> At manor farm in Plaitford there is a 
 moot where saxons used to meet.In the 
 middle of the moot there used to be a 
 hunting lodge where king Edmand used  
 to hunt .He hunted in what is Melchet 
 court now. At the gate there          
 are 2 big stones under the ground.A   
 man thinks that they are foundations  
 of a great gate that leads to the     
 hunting lodge .Where the moot was     
 there is a pond but when it was used  
 for a saxon meeting place it was dry  
 and there were no reeds or bushes     
 there.Next to the moot there is a     
 staddle barn where someone used to put
 their corn or wheat in to keep the    
 rats from eating it.We dont know how  
 old the staddle barn is but it must be
 very old because the planks of wood   
 weren't sawn, they were split.
