		<content>We attend Saint Columba's School.It is 
one of the newest schools in our area. 
Our new sports field has been laid out 
and seeded but we cannot use it yet.   
Instead our Games teacher takes us out 
to a place we call The Valley.It is a  
large stretch of open ground between   
two housing developments,just over the 
way from our school.It is separated    
from Richardson Dees Park by a         
secondary road,so it seems like a      
private place to play.There is a stream
which runs through the centre into the 
pond in the park opposite.It has two   
little bridges and some stepping       
stones.We enjoy jumping over it,       
especially in winter,when it is frozen.
We use the grass for our long distance 
and handicap races.In summer it is a   
lovely place to enjoy a picnic.
