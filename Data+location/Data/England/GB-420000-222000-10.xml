 The first question was can you tell   
 us a bit about the history of Icomb.

 ago then we asked which school she    
 went to.she used to live at chelnham. 
 she went to a school called glouster  
 road. is there a school in Icomb      
 there used to be a school in Icomb but
 that closed down in 1963. The school  
 has been turned into a house. she     
 came to Icomb in 1948 the house was   
 finised about 8 years ago her         
 husband made the house in about 1977. 
 They used to have a cat. she likes    
 living there very much. There         
 transport  is a car she is the school 
 govaner and so is my  Dad.
