 There are a hundred and twenty-four   
 caravans at Rushy Hill Caravan Site.  
 The larger caravans are more in the   
 majority than the smaller ones.  The  
 larger caravans can go up to          
 thirty-six feet and the smaller ones  
 go up to twenty-one feet.  There are  
 all types of caravans all colours,    
 sizes and shades.  There are four     
 buildings with toilets in.  The       
 caravan site is one hundred and       
 fifty-two acres all together.  The    
 managers of the site have a house at  
 the top of the caravan site.  The site
 is divided into blocks and there are  
 two washrooms in each block.  There is
 one laundry with one washing machine  
 and one tumble drier.  There are also 
 six basins in the laundry.  Rushy Hill
 is a little smaller than the caravan  
 site in Newhaven.                     </content>
