		<title>13 Grubbing Out.</title>
		<content>We saw 4 men tramping along a track    
across what looked like a badly        
ploughed field, picking up what looked 
like giant parsnips.We spoke to them   
later. They were grubbing out an       
orchard of Bramley cooking apples.     
After about 60 years a Bramley orchard 
is grubbed out and left fallow for 12  
months.Then a winter wheat is          
cultivated.The following year,with     
the soil recovered and old roots       
rotted to avoid root diseases,the next 
crop of young trees is planted. Eating 
apple orchards are grubbed out after   
only 20 years.The men doing the        
grubbing were contracted by Arnold     
Fruit Farms to carry out grubbing as   
it would be uneconomic for even large  
farms to own their own bulldozers and  
grubbing machinery. Grubbing ends in   
summer when contract workers turn to   
harvesting with specialist machinery.  </content>
