{                                      
{ Belsay}is a small village situated 15
 miles Northwest of Newcastle on the   
 main A696 route through to Jedburgh.  
 The area, being rural, is principally 
 a farming area, the main landowner    
 being the{Belsay Estate,}originally   
 owned by the{Middleton}family.        
   The main arcade of houses and shops 
 is built from honey-coloured stone    
 containing flecks of iron quarried    
 locally. The homes under the arcade   
 were originally small shops but are   
 now owner-occupied houses.            
   The school, another focal point in  
 the village, is used for the education
 of young children aged from 4 to 9. It
 is in fact the second building, the   
 first now a private dwelling on the   
 Morpeth Road.
