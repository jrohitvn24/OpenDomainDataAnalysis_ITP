		<content> A modern environmental health         
 department has an advisory and        
 enforcing role in matters relating to 
 the health of the inhabitants.The     
 evolution of public health law is tied
 up with the concept of nuisance,i.e.  
 something which affects or prevents   
 someone's exercise or enjoyment of    
 certain rights.                       
 In 1984 in the Bootle area            
 approximately 1500 complaints were    
 made to the department which resulted 
 in 388 statutory notices being        
 served.Court proceedings,for failure  
 to comply with notices,were instigated
 in two cases.                         
 The presence of vermin,known vectors  
 of disease,is controlled              
 by the local authority and about 2000 
 premises were treated,in the Bootle   
 area in 1984,for the presence of      
 vermin(rats,mice and cockroaches).    </content>
