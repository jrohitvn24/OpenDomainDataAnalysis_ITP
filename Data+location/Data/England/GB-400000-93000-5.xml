		<content> I go to a United Reformed Church.It   
 stands on the corner of Mitchell Road 
 opposite the Old Peoples Home.Services
 are held every Sunday at 10.00am,2nd  
 Sunday evening of every month at 6.30.
 Our service begins with a passage from
 the Bible,continues with a hymn/song, 
 then a teaching followed again with   
 singing.Mr Mellor(our minister)then   
 takes up the offering of our money and
 we pray.Notices concerning the church 
 for the week are read by an Elder.This
 is followed by singing and prayers    
 which includes the Lords Prayer.The   
 children leave the service for Sunday 
 School.We have five age groups a      
 creche(under 3)3-6,7-10,11-13,13 on.  
 People from our church are very       
 friendly,welcoming visitors like      
 William who came from Papua New Guinea
