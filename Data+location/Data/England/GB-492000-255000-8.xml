 We were interested in finding out     
 whether or not Harrold was a          
 "dormitory village". We thought       
 that,perhaps,most residents would work
 in London or possibly in Milton       
 Keynes.                               
 However the results of our survey of  
 lOO people showed that 22% of our     
 sample worked in Bedford and over 6O% 
 worked either in Harrold itself or    
 very locally in neighbouring villages.
 Only about 5% worked in London with a 
 similar number working in Milton      
 Keynes, whilst the remaining l3%      
 described themselves as 'mobile',     
 working throughout the south east of  
 the country.
