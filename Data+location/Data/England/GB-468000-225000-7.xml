		<content> There has been much{change in patterns
{of employment}in the village.Prior to 
 W.W.2 the 2 main sources of employment
 were the{brickworks}at Calvert and    
 agriculture.The former remains a large
 employer but in{agriculture}there have
 been changes that are discussed       
 elsewhere.There is some industry in   
 the village but{none manufacturing a  
{product.}There are several firms      
 employed in the{building trade}ranging
 from a large haulage firm:T.Taylor    
 Ltd.to smaller roofing firms such as  
 O.Weingart Ltd.Langston &amp; Tasker,the  
 local{coach company,}have about 15    
 vehicles used on regular contracts for
 local firms and schools.there has been
 a growth of{very small businesses,}one
 or two people working together and    
 these range from printing to catering 
 and appear quite successful,if never  
 likely to grow very large.            </content>
