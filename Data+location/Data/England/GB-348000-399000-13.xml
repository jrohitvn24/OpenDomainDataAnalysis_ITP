		<title>13 HOUSING</title>
		<content> The housing in this area varies mainly
between housing estates and old stone  
houses,some of which have been renovat-
ed.Housing estates are mainly situated 
in Rainford,but there are also small   
groups of houses throughout the region.
 The housing in the country areas is   
mostly farmhouses - many dating back to
the 17th Century.These are of local    
sandstone,but many have been covered   
with cement stucco and extensively     
modernised.Crow's Nest Farm,now very   
modernised,used to be a cafe in the    
nineteen thirties,when Shaley Brow was 
very popular for outings.A mill also   
used to stand on this site,of which the
millpond and millstone still exist as  
garden features.Some of the houses are 
listed buildings and therefore cannot  
be altered.The people in this area are 
well housed and have modern amenities.
