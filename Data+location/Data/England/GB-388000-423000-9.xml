		<title>09Forestry on Todmorden Moor</title>
		<content> In the past it was likely that the    
 whole area was forested but this has  
 long since disappeared. There have    
 been moves in recent years to replace 
 a lot of the woodland and this has    
 been a twofold effort.                
 The{Forestry Commission}has planted   
 large tracts of land on the top of the
 moor with{pine plantations}and on the 
 valley sides (particularly noticeable 
 on the Burnley Road side near the     
 recreation ground) there have been    
 attempts by individuals and the local 
 authority to replant the hillsides    
 with deciduous trees for the benefit  
 of future generations. Most of this   
 hillside planting has taken place     
 since 1982.
