		<title>19Robert Marfleet's House</title>
		<content>    My name is Robert Marfleet and I am
 11 years old.  My house was built in  
 about 1750.  It has 10 rooms not      
 including the 2 halls.  Our house is  
 made of brick.  I measured some of the
 rooms in square feet:-                
      the lounge is 208 sq.feet        
      my bedroom is  90 sq.feet        
      the kitchen is 190 sq.feet       
      the garden is 195 sq.yards       
    We have quite a lot of special     
 things including a cellar, garage,    
 barn, stables, 2 lofts and a woodshed.
    The value of my house is Â£50,000.  
 I have lived in it for for 6 years.   
 Our house was a pub and a farm, but I 
 do not know when.   It is heated by   
 burning coke and wood which we put in 
 the Aga.  We also burn oil.  We have 2
 cars.  One of them is a Vauxhall, and 
 the other is a Ford.
