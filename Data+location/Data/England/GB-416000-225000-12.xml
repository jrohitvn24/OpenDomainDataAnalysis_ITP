		<title>12HOUSING IN STOW</title>
		<content> With a plentiful supply of{limestone  
 to be had for the quarrying, all the  
 pre-1900 houses are built of{natural  
{stone.}The coming of the{railway}made 
{bricks}and{slates}available and some  
 houses built in the first half of the 
 20th century used these materials and 
 when the District Council had to      
 provide housing quickly and cheaply   
 after the 2nd War bricks were again   
 used. Subsequently stone dust has been
 reconstituted to provide a{concrete   
{building block}moulded in various     
 sizes to give the appearance of       
 natural stone and this has provided   
 the material for most recent building.
 Natural stone is now very costly and  
 is reserved for prestige projects or  
 for those people who have a deep      
 feeling for the appearance of the     
 district.                             
                                       </content>
