		<title>07NEWLAND PARK, 1.</title>
		<content> At first some children thought that   
{Newland Park}was a recreational play  
 area. When we arrived we discovered   
 that it was a long windy road full of 
 different types of houses. It is a    
 quiet road which comes off one of the 
 busiest routes into Hull. In Newland  
 Park there are about two hundred      
 houses. They are all large houses.    
 Some are detached houses, some are    
 semi-detached, some are bungalows and 
 there was a small block of six flats. 
 There are no terraced houses.         
   The trees in the gardens sread      
 across the road like an archway. All  
 the gardens are enormous. In the      
 gardens you can see large areas of    
 grass surrounded by deep borders full 
 of brightly coloured flowers and      
 shrubs. In some of the gardens        
 there are some unusual things, such as
 a full size anchor.                   </content>
