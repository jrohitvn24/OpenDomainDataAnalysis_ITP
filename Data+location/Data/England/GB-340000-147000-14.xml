		<title>14LAW AND ORDER IN WEDMORE</title>
		<content>   The average policeman carries a     
 truncheon, keys, handcuffs and a      
 walkie-talkie. In Somerset there are  
 approximately 3 500 people in the     
 police force.                         
   The Wedmore area is patrolled by a  
 team of three policemen who are       
 responsible for Wedmore, Cheddar and  
 Axbridge. When an offender is caught  
 he is taken to Bridgwater Police      
 Staion and put in a cell.             
   You have to be 18\ to join the      
 Police Force and 16 to join the       
 cadets. Before you join the force you 
 have to pass a fitness test. The      
 retiring age is 60 and you have 20-30 
 years in the force.                   
   The uniform is now lighter and      
 fire proof.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
