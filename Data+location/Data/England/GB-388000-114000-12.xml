		<title>12ANIMAL LIFE NEAR STUBHAMPTON</title>
		<content> Typical species of wildlife in the    
 area:-badgers,stoats,weasels,grey     
 squirrels,rabbits,deer,pheasants and  
 partridges.   Badgers are on the      
 increase,as are grey squirrels.       
 Myxomatosis is still prevelant in the 
 rabbit population and this has caused 
 a decline in the number of stoats and 
 weasels.There has been a gradual      
 change from Fallow Deer to Roe Deer in
 the area.The Roe Deer have adapted    
 much better to the reduction in open  
 grassland and increase in conifer     
 planting.   The loss of deciduous     
 trees has caused a reduction in the   
 number of owls in the area because of 
 the reduced number of nesting sites.  
 Buzzards,however,have adapted quite   
 well to changing environment and are  
 thought possibly to be on the         
 increase.
