 My name is Michael and I am 10 years  
 Old. I set off for school at eight    
 thirty. As the bell rings at nine     
 o'clock I have plenty of time to play.
 After registration at nine fifteen we 
 have assembly in the hall. Reading,   
 English, Maths and break take us up to
 dinner time. I have a meal cooked in  
 the School Kitchen but many of my     
 friends take a packed lunch from home.
 After eating I go out to play with my 
 friends. Then the bell goes at one    
 thirty and I go in and sit down.      
 Afternoons include Art and Craft,     
 games, music and Project work lessons 
 and end at three thirty when I go     
 home. Sometimes I go swimming before  
 tea and in the evening have football  
 practice or Cub Scouts. I am usually  
 home by eight and watch television    
 until nine o'clock when I go to bed.  </content>
