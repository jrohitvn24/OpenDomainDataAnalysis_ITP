		<content>{Bognor Regis}is a{sea-side resort     
 situated in{West Sussex}on the South  
 Coast.                                
 Before 1784 Bognor, or{Bognor Rocks   
 as it was known then, was little more 
 than a few fishermen's cottages.But in
 1784{Sir Richard Hotham,}a Yorkshire  
 hatter, visited the area and decided  
 that it would make an ideal watering  
 -place for the royalty and aristocracy
 of that time.He,therefore, set about  
 building many fine{Georgian}homes some
 of which still remain today.          
 During the{19th century}Bognor        
 continued to expand as  a sea-side    
 resort as the{Victorian}middle-classes
 came to visit the town and take       
 advantage of the sea-air and the mild 
 climate.                              
 Following the convalescence of George 
 V in 1929 the town was granted the    
 title of{'Regis'.                     </content>
