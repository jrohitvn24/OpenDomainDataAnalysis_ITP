		<title>19ON THE RIVER IN PULBOROUGH.</title>
		<content> People use the River Arun in many ways
 for recreation. The river has tides   
 and a strong current so swimming is   
 dangerous, but people go boating.There
 are 30 Pulborough and West Chiltington
 Sea Scouts who meet every Friday      
 night. They practise canoeing, and the
 Scouts and Guides use the river for   
 the Arun canoe race. Lots of people go
 fishing in the river. You can catch   
 dace, pike, bream, perch, carp,       
 rudd and gudgeon, but you need a      
 strong line and rod. The best places  
 are in the shade and winter is the    
 best time of year, when it is breezy. 
 You need bread bait for bream and     
 carp, and live maggots for perch, dace
 roach and gudgeon. You can buy bait   
 and get a licence in the fishing shop 
 near the river. The Pulborough Angling
 Society has about 200 members.
