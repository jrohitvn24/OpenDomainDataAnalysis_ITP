		<title>20Farming In Our Area</title>
		<content> In our area there are about eight     
 farms and several smallholdings.The   
 big ones are Overbury Estates,Darbys  
 and Grays.The most common crop is{corn
 but there is some{Oilseed Rape        
 scattered around.There are mainly{beef
{cattle}but some herds of{dairy cattle 
   A lot of fields are used for grazing
 and other purposes such as silage and 
 hay.                                  
   The larger landowners practice a lot
 of{conservation,}with tree planting   
 schemes,new ponds etc.                
   There are large herds of sheep at   
 Overbury and there was until recently 
 a pig farm in Bredon.                 
   The smaller farms are much less     
 specialised and you are likely to find
 all kinds of crops and  animals on the
 same farm.
