 When Burrington ex-soldiers returned  
 after World War I they wanted to form 
 a{Comrades Club,}so Major General Sir 
 Arnold Taggart of Northcote Manor     
 bought a wooden army hut and Mr.W.E.  
 Short gave the site.In{1929}a splendid
{ Parish Hall}was erected by means of a
 loan from Lt.Col. Gracey of Northcote 
 Manor. The Hall was linked to the     
{Men's Club}by a corridor.In 1943-44   
 fire in the corridor resulted in the  
 destruction of both buildings.The site
 was cleared pending the removal of    
 building restrictions. After the war  
 a temporary corrugated asbestos       
 building, looking like a giant{maggot,
 was erected to serve as{Club and      
{Parish Hall.}The present magnificent  
 Hall was built in{1959,}financed by   
 grants and local efforts.The extension
 to the mens club was built in{1978.   </content>
