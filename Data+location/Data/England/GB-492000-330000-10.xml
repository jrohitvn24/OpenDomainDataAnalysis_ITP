		<content>       Changes in the last 80 years    
   Mr.&amp;Mrs.Harris have seen many       
 changes to Great Ponton in their      
 lifetime.They can remember there being
 several small businesses in the       
 village including;a shoemaker;a       
 carpenter;a wheelwright;a blacksmith  
 ;and a mill and bakery.In 1919 Gt     
 Ponton railway station was opened.The 
 village had a school on the west      
 side(built in 1717).                  
    Over the last 80 years all the     
 small businesses have disappeared     
 ,apart from the blacksmith.In the     
 1960s the A1 was made into a dual     
 carriageway which changed the nature  
 of the village.The school was moved   
 from the west side into the centre of 
 the village because of the traffic. A 
 proposed road bridge,to avoid the     
 isolation of the west side,has never  
 been built.                           </content>
