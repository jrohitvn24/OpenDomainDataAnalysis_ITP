		<content>                                       
In the tree,                           
Dark and cold.                         
Dirt all around us,                    
Spiders crawling in the cracks,        
Everywhere about us,                   
Up above the tree so high,             
In the sun by the sky.                 
Branchs leading here and there,        
Sticking out leaves everywhere.        
                                       
The hollow tree is visited by a lot of 
children who use it as a camp and to   
climb on.The tree has a lot of space   
inside. The hollow tree is near the    
lake and is just to the left of the    
bridge. The girth of the tree is 9.3   
metres. The perimeter of the canopy    
cover is 67 metres. The height of the  
tree is about 18 to 19 metres.         
Some children call it the Echo Tree.
