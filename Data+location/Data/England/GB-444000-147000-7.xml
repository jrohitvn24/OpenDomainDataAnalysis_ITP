		<content>   Whitchurch is only a small shopping 
 centre for the people who live in the 
 town and those people who live in the 
 small villages that surround          
 Whitchurch.There are very few people  
 who would shop in Whitchurch because  
 it has not a large number of shops.   
   You can buy most of the things that 
 you need for everyday life in         
 Whitchurch,you could do all your      
 weekly food shopping in Whitchurch if 
 you wished but a lot of people who    
 live in Whitchurch prefer to do their 
 shopping in supermarkets in towns such
 as Basingstoke,Andover and            
 Winchester.People tend to shop for    
 just one or two items rather than     
 doing their main shopping.
