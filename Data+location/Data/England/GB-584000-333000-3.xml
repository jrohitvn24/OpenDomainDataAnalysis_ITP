		<content> The area is served by a village       
 primary school.  The number of pupils 
 is decreasing and in consequence the  
 Education Authority has removed a     
 teacher.  The school has a headmaster,
 one teacher and a part-time welfare   
 assistant for 46 pupils between the   
 ages of 4 and 11 years.  The Victorian
 building has detached toilets, causing
 problems in severe weather.  Lunches  
 are cooked in the kitchens of a school
 two miles distant and delivered by car
 in metal containers.  It seems likely 
 that in the future the school will be 
 closed and children will be bussed to 
 the modern County Primary School at   
 Burnham Market, a distance of 4 miles 
 away.  This would be seen by many as  
 contributing to the disintegration of 
 village community life, but some      
 parents feel their children would be  
 receiving a better education elsewhere</content>
