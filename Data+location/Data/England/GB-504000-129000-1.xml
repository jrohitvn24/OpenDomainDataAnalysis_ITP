		<title>01Eastern fringe of Fosewood</title>
		<content> Pleasant area of new developments in  
 Fosewood village includes church,     
 ridge over view and locals inn.  The  
 river meanders east via Brewhurst mill
 (no longer used) also Gibbons mill.   
 River meadows provide good grazing and
 the clevelid wig-rum canal follows the
 valley.  Mostly grassland and a       
 spinnly of cultavated fields away from
 the river.  Some contain plantations  
 on the Brewhurst estate but oak trees 
 in hedge rows much in evidence        
 throughout the area.  Small coppice   
 woods and mews typical of much of the 
 weald area.  drungewick Manor, once   
 the country seat of the Bishops of    
 Chicter  is still a noted house in    
 this area but with its now dry moat   
 and only a few acres of land hardly   
 resemles its bygone glories.  Apart   
 from fosewood the population is very  
 sparse.                               </content>
