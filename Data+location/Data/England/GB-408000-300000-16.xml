		<title>16Social Concerns</title>
		<content>Residents are concerned to maintain the
village atmosphere and avoid being     
taken over by the nearby City of       
Birmingham.                            
After village concern about a number of
accidents at the crossroads by the Post
Office,the District Council have       
promised a 40 mph speed limit for the  
whole length of Blake St,and traffic   
lights at some future date.            
Heavy traffic uses these roads as a rat
run between motorways.After a public   
enquiry weight restrictions were placed
on Rosemary Hill Rd and Little Aston   
Lane.                                  
The threat of a new motorway to relieve
the M6 has alarmed residents of Little 
Aston as one of the proposed routes    
would cross the good agricultural land 
just to the north of the village.The   
Minister's decision is expected very   
soon.                                  </content>
