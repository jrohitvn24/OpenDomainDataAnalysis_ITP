		<title>17Stan Laurel of Ulverston</title>
		<content>   Stan Laurel is Ulverston's most     
 famous son. He was the smaller of the 
 comic duo{Laurel &amp; Hardy}which graced 
 the cinema screens during the 1920s   
 and 1930s.                            
   Stan Laurel was born on the 16th    
 June 1890 at 3 Argyle St. Ulverston,  
 and for this reason a Laurel &amp; Hardy  
 museum was established in the town in 
 1975. Many admirers of the duo's      
 unique talents belong to the worldwide
 Laurel &amp; Hardy appreciation society   
 the "Sons of the Desert",a title taken
 from the 1933 film of the same name.  
   International conventions of the    
 "Sons of the Desert" take place regul-
 arly,the fourth having taken place in 
 Stan's home town in 1984. This event  
 attracted many visitors to the town,  
 particularly from America.
