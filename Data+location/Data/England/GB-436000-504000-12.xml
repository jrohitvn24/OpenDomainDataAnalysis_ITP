		<title>12CHANGINGTIMES APPLETON WISKE</title>
		<content> Mrs.Ellen Gathergood has lived in     
 Appleton all her life,she remembers   
 that"Every year there was a village   
 sports day with events for all ages.  
 All the children got a silver sixpence
 and everyone had tea on the green.    
 National events such as the 1935      
 Jubilee,1945 V.E celebrations and 1953
 coronation were always celebrated by  
 comunity fancy dress,sports and a     
 village party.Until 1952 people got   
 their water from pumps,one outside the
 Nelson,the other near the village shop
 .Electricity came in 1952 before that 
 houses were lit by parrafin lamps and 
 cooking was done by oil cookers.The   
 school took all the children 5-14.    
 Attendance was poor at harvestime     
 because children stayed off school to 
 help on the farms.Most people had     
 bikes,trains ran from Welbury station 
 and a bus service started in 1928.    </content>
