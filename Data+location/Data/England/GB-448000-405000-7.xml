		<title>07Local History at Hickleton.</title>
		<content> Hickleton{church}was built in Saxon   
 times.But the first major{church}was  
 built in Norman times.The{church}has  
 had to be almost rebuilt because of   
 mining subsidence,{archaeologists     
 being able to do interesting work.    
 Sixty two corpses have been found     
 outside,including children.Under the  
 floor of the church were many burials 
 from medieval times,including a{priest
 with a lead chalice and a ring.There  
 was also the grave of an ancient Lord 
 of the Manor with an effigy in stone. 
 Doncaster and Sheffield museums have  
 been interested in the treaures that  
 have been found.The{priest}of the     
{church}is also a teacher.The{church   
 has now had a concrete raft put       
 under it to stop more damage being    
 done by mining subsidence.The corpses 
 are at Sheffield University  to be    
 examined before reburial at Hickleton.</content>
