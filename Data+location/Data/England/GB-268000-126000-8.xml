		<content>  Trampus is our dog. He cost about    
 sixty pounds and we feed him on       
 Pedigree Chum and Winalot. He has got 
 some squeaky toys that when you press 
 them they squeak. When we first got   
 him he lived in a cardboard box but he
 started nibbling the corners so we got
 him a basket to live in.              
  We also give him Dogie Chocs when    
 he's good and four shapes every night.
 His hobbies are having bones and      
 taking slippers outside. He has been  
 vaccinated so he can't mate. We usally
 take him with us everywhere we go but 
 when that is not possible we let him  
 stay with friends.                    
  He is a three and a half years old   
 dog but in dog years he is twenty-one 
 and a half years old. He is a born    
 gun-dog.
