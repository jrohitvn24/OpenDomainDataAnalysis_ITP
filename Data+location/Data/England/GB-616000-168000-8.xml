		<title>08CARING FOR ELDERLY HERNE BAY</title>
		<content> I have heard Herne Bay referred to as 
 the old age capital of England,       
 because of the number of old people in
 the area and the number of old        
 people's homes. As the holiday trade  
 has declined many people have been    
 forced to find a new means of income  
 and Herne Bay which is something of a 
 quiet backwater also has the large    
 old Victorian and Edwardian houses    
 which can be adapted for this purpose.
 It is difficult to estimate just how  
 many old people's homes there are in  
 the town as some private families look
 after old people in an extension of   
 their homes and this would not be     
 apparent from the exterior of the     
 house. Out of our class of 28 children
 at Hampton School, five of the mothers
 worked looking after old people in    
 some professional capacity.
