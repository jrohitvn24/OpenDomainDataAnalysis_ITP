		<title>11THE GAS PIPELINE,COTEHILL</title>
		<content> Last year a gas pipeline was built.   
 There was already a pipe line carring 
 gas from Aberdeen to Manchester but   
 this one leaves it at Longtown and    
 goes on to Manchester . Lots of under 
 groWth was pulled up and when you     
 walked along the pipeline, the dust   
 was up to your ankles. The pipeline   
 was built by Macalpines. Every day    
 convoys of lowloders, land            
 rovers,JCBs and welding machines      
 went past  making a right racket      
 .Macalpines were based at Cocklakes   
 old factory in our block .Now the     
 pipeline is over you can see hedges   
 starting to grow where it had been dug
 up.                                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
