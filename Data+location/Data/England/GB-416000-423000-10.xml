 I am very interested in religion in   
 our area since my grandfather,        
 grandmother and I are all             
 pentecostalists. We meet on a Sunday  
 in Dewsbury. We have bread and wine at
 communion and we also sing about three
 songs.                                
 One boy in my class is a mormon. He   
 cannot drink tea or coffee because it 
 has caffeine in it. The services are  
 3 hours long.                         
 5 people in my class are church of    
 England they take communion and sing  
 hymns the services last an hour before
 they go home.                         
 I carried out a survey in school and  
 found  that most children were C of E,
 3 were Catholics  and 18 Methodists   
 30 children out of 300 go to church   
 every week,36 five times a year.
