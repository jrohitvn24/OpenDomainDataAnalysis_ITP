		<title>03EMPLOYMENT ROUND CROFT.</title>
		<content>  Most people who live in the area work
 in one of the neighbouring towns of   
 Northallerton, Darlington or Richmond,
 although some people travel much      
 further afield to Tees-side,Newcastle 
 or Leeds.                             
  Except for farm work, there is little
 employment for people in the villages.
 There is a small dairy in Dalton on   
 Tees and a building in the village is 
 used as a joiner's shop. In Croft     
 there are two small electrical        
 businesses employing about nine people
 each. Also in Croft there are two     
 jobbing builders and a landscape      
 gardener. The old school has been     
 converted into an estate agents and a 
 surgeon lives in the old rectory,     
 where some of his patients visit him. 
  The largest employers in the villages
 are St.Cuthbert's Hospital,Croft Spa  
 Hotel and the two schools.            </content>
