		<content> The dominant geographical feature is  
 the River Waveney which bisects the   
 block in a N.E. - S.W. direction. The 
 river is not navigable here, but it is
 well stocked with coarse fish, and is 
 extensively fished by local anglers.  
 The water meadows by the river are    
 subject to flooding and their use is  
 confined to grazing and cropping for  
 hay and silage. Gravel beds within the
 block are extensively worked and where
 excavation has been completed         
 landscaping has produced attracive    
 lakes, well used by wildfowl and      
 fishermen. Homersfield (the former    
 site of a Ramano/British Settlement)  
 is a village of about 50 houses. It   
 has a high percentage of retired      
 people and the working population is  
 mainly employed in industry outside

 the block is Flixton, which is similar</content>
