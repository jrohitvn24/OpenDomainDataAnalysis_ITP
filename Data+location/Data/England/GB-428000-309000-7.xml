		<title>07SIR JOHN MOORE SCHOOL PART 2</title>
		<content>  The school was originally{free}for   
 the boys of the local area but soon   
 concentrated upon{fee paying boarders.
 In the 1860's there was complete      
 separation into Grammar and English   
 (free) Schools.{In 1904}the{Grammar   
{school closed}due to lack of support  
 and the whole building became the     
 village{boys elementary school.       
  This{closed in 1933}and the boys     
 transferred to the girls church school
 in the village.During the{2nd. World  
{War}the building was used by the      
{military}and then stood{disused}until 
 the school{reopened}as the village    
 primary school{in 1957.               
  The{dormitories}are now used only as 
 store rooms.The{dome}is in a bad state
 of repair but the{clock}was restored  
 in 1984.However the village children  
 enjoy working in the beautiful        
 building, just as Sir John wanted!    </content>
