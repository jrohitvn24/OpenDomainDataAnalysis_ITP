		<content>  {"Most of the people here now are    
{complete strangers to me."}This remark
 by one resident of more than 50 years 
 reflects a sentiment expressed by     
 several older inhabitants, and        
 underlines the social changes         
 resulting from the profound changes in
 farming describe elsewhere. In        
 addition to the few remaining farm    
 workers and two gamekeepers, the      
 population includes an agricultural   
 engineer who came to the Island 30    
 years ago when his parents retired    
 here, a couple who retired from       
 Huddersfield 16 years ago to live next
 door to their gamekeeper son, a       
 retired bus driver, and two girls who 
 share a rented cottage; one working in
 an Estate Agents in Newport, and the  
 other working in a bank in Cowes.{"I  
{left home because I felt it was time  
{to. I still get on with my parents."} </content>
