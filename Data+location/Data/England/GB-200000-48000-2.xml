		<content>   The nearest town of any size,ST.    
 Austell,is the centre for work,schools
 ,shopping and many forms of entertain-
 -ment.                                
   Outlying villagers try to generate  
 community spirit by maintaining tradi-
 -itional Feast Weeks or Feast Days,in 
 honour of early Cornish Saints or the 
 foundation of churches,added to which 
 are Carnival Weeks and concerts for   
 bands,choirs and cornish speaking.    
   The area is rural and peaceful.Those
 who move here to live comment upon the
 security and freedom from the fears of
 street violence.Community spirit is   
 strong,including all ages in local    
 activities.                           
   Young people living here spend alot 
 of their time on the beach or the sea.
 Sailing and fishing are very popular, 
 in poor weather there are usually rep-
 -airs to be done on boats and tackle. </content>
