 LOCAL HISTORY                         
 Lots of the houses in Bentworth are   
 less than 50 years old.Between 50 and 
 200 years ago not many houses were    
 built.Over 200 years ago many more    
 houses were built.One house is Tudor  
 style and Hall Farm is medieval.      
 We found out that brick is the most   
 popular building material by a long   
 way.Flint in Bentworth is the second  
 most popular building material because
 Bentworth is on flint.Tile hung and   
 rendered,although they look nice there
 very few in Bentworth.There is one    
 stone house and one pebbledashed.     
 Most houses in Bentworth have a name  
 such as Hunters End,Hookers Place,The 
 White House,Hunts Cottage and Strawtop
