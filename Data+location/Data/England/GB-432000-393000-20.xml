		<title>20The Beagles</title>
		<content> When we went to Ecclesfield Church    
 we decided to walk back to school over
 the fields.On our way back we saw the 
 Ecclesfield Beagles Kennels.The dogs  
 were making alot of noise.This summer 
 (1985) 26 hounds were stolen from the 
 kennels,it is believed that they were 
 stolen by animal rights               
 campaigners.The 26 dogs were valued at
 Â£800 and each has the letters EB      
 tattoed on its left ear and a number  
 on its right ear.Eleven dogs were left
 behind.The Eccesfield Beagles Hunt    
 begins in October.Ten Couples are     
 needed for the hunt.
