		<content> The area is predominantly Christian   
 with a higher than usual proportion of
 Roman Catholics. The R.C. churches    
 still have substantial regular        
 congregations inspite of there being  
 many lapsed members.                  
 The C of E Churches have moderate     
 congregations, but many parishioners  
 no longer attend.                     
 Baptist and Congregationalist Churches
 can be found in this area with Gospel 
 Hall and Spiritualist groups also.    
 The Salvation Army is represented in  
 moderate premises,its  child          
 orientated activities attract many    
 local children.                       
 The Methodist Churches are now        
 combined and have become the United   
 Reformed Church.                      
 The ethnic communities are served by a
 Mosque at South Shields which was     
 rebuilt in 1971.                      </content>
