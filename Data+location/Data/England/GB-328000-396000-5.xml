		<content>{Recreation:Victoria Park activities   
    Victoria Park is used by young and 
 old.Recreational activities include   
 bowling greens, tennis courts and a   
 playground.The bowling greens are used
 frequently by men and women.We asked  
 spectators some questions about the   
 park and we found out from them that  
 it was ideal surroundings for bowls,  
 for company and that it was a very    
 beautiful park.The playground area of 
 the park had in it a rocket,two merry 
 go rounds,swings, climbing frames,    
 tennis courts and playing fields.The  
 tennis courts are all hard and the    
 schools that mainly used them were    
 Streatham and Merchant Taylors'.      
    There is a Pavilion in the Park    
 where pensioners have clubs.In the    
 Pavilion is a dart board,a piano and a
 radio.Pensioners play cards and other 
 games.                                </content>
