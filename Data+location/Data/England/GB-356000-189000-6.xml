		<title>06Travellers at Aust Services</title>
		<content> We visited Aust Services on Tuesday 18
 June 1985.We stayed there from        
 10.00a.m. until 12.15p.m. In this time
 the car parks rapidly filled. There   
 were a number of coaches which had    
 come from many different areas of the 
 United Kingdom. Some were on day trips
 to Wales,others were taking passengers
 on touring holidays. One senior       
 citizen said she was on a day's outing
 with her club to Barry. Another lady  
 we spoke to said she lived in South   
 Wales was travelling to Ascot for a   
 stay of a few days and would be       
 sleeping with her family in their van.
 There were also a number of transport 
 lorries. They had come from many      
 places including Southern             
 Ireland,Wales and Denmark
