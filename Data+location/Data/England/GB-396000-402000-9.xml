 High School, on Friday, 19th July     
 1985, to raise money for the          
 Bangladesh Cyclone Disaster Appeal.   
 The function was attended by the      
 Deputy Mayor of Tameside and many     
 local dignitaries. Mossley has a small
 Bangladeshi community who raised Â£270 
 for the appeal. A mixed audience was  
 entertained by:                       
     Mossley Hollins Band              
     The Magnolia Jazz Band

     Sangeet Sangam                    
  A local committee, sponsored by
