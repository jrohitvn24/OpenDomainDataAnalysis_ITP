 consists of nine members.  Two        
 parents, One Parish Councillor, One   
 teacher representative, four Dorset   
 County Council appointments and the   
 Head Teacher.  There is a Friends of  
 the School association, which helps to
 promote school activities, social and 
 community functions and financial help
 to purchase educational items.  The   
 school is fortunate to use the        
 swimming pool at Bovington each       
 Wednesday, and the parents are askd to
 make a small contribution towards     
 transport and hiring fees.  Gymnastic 
 and athletic awards are given.  The   
 school has recently won several awards
 for its environmental areas, including
 butterfly zone, nature trails, bird   
 trails, tree planting, bat and bird   
 boxes, and play areas. The present    
 Head Master is Mr. A. Herridge.       </content>
