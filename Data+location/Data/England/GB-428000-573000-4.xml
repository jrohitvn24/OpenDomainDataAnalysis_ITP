		<title>04Our Visit to the Archives.</title>
		<content> On{Monday, 13th May}we went on a visit
 to the County Archive. Our guide was  
 Mrs. Burt. She showed us many{old     
{slides}and old books from which we got
 a picture of Seaton Delaval as it was.
 One slide in particular was very      
 interesting. It showed some boys      
 playing at the beach at Seaton Sluice 
 and wearing their best clothes. We    
 wondered what our mothers would say if
 we did that today!                    
 The{colliery}in Seaton Delaval was    
 first owned by the Seaton Delaval Coal
 Co. Ltd. and employed 970 men and     
 boys. The Coal Co. erected the        
 Mechanics Institute with reading      
 rooms, billiard room and smoke rooms  
 at a cost of Â£1 000. Today this       
 building stands near our school,      
 derelict.
