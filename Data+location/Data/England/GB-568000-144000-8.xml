		<title>08CHANGING HOUSING:OASTS.</title>
		<content>Because hop growing is declining,a lot 
of oasts in Kent are converted.There   
are 3 nearby which suggests that they  
are very popular.Martins Farm is a     
converted oast in Collier Street.It was
bought for 18,500 pounds in 1978 though
would now sell for 120,000 pounds.When 
it was bought ,the roof was falling in 
and it had no water,electricity or     
windows.After 9 months the family were 
able to move in and 15 months later all
the rooms were in use..it cost 30,000  
pounds.They preferred converting the   
square oast as furniture was easier to 
fit.They liked the oast as it was part 
of the character of Kent.The oast house
is very spacious and there are 12      
rooms.One disadvantage of living in an 
oast house is that the water pipes     
burst in the winter because the roof is
open.Also the law says that you cannot 
put an extension on an oast house.     </content>
