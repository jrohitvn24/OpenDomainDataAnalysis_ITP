		<title>03St.Mary's Church,Rye</title>
		<content>  St. Mary's church is a very old and  
 famous church which dates back 800    
 years. There are different styles of  
 architecture because some of the      
 church was burnt down in the fire by  
 the French in 1377 and rebuilt soon   
 after. The church has two quarter boys
 that ring bells on the quarter hour.  
 Also there is a very old clock,       
 probably one of the oldest in England.
 There are some very beautiful stained 
 glass windows, especially the east and
 west ones. Many famous people to the  
 town of Rye are buried here, like     
 James Lamb the mayor. The church is   
 one of the oldest buildings in the    
 town. Once England gave Rye to the    
 French, but about a century later     
 England regained it.
