		<title>06THE KING'S HOUSE</title>
		<content>{GRID REFERENCE 205652}                
 About half a mile south west of the   
 present Cowick Hall lies a site known 
 as Manor Hill. The original royal     
 manor house, referred to as the       
 'King's House' stood here. The site   
 has now been ploughed into near       
 extinction and all traces of the      
 building have disappeared. The moat   
 still survives. It's banks are a      
 tangle of blackberry bushes. There is 
 a tradition in the area that the moat 
 was bridged on the South side.        
 The Manor House was probably erected  
 in the twelfth century and it is      
 likely that some, or all of the Kings 
 from John to Edward 111 used the base 
 for hunting excursions into Hatfield  
 Chase.
