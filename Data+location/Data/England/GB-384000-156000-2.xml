		<content> They get good work there. We use      
 computers to draw out some of our     
 money. They also help by counting how 
 much money we have. So you are O.K.   
 working in a bank.                    
 Money today consists of copper and    
 silver coins and paper notes. Notes   
 have special watermarks so they cant  
 be forged.  This is the money we use  
 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p and Â£1 coin.
 Â£1, Â£5, Â£10, Â£20, Â£50 are notes. The  
 Â£1 note will not be in use for long   
 because the Â£1 coin is replacing it.  
 If you have a bank account you will   
 also have a cheque book which you can 
 use instead of money. You put money in
 the Building Societies which gives you
 more interest than when you put it in 
 the bank. Sometimes you have to use a 
 credit card with a cheque to prove    
 that the cheque book is yours.        
 Autocards can be used.                </content>
