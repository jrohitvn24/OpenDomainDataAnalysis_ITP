 The people in Maidencombe like peace  
 and quiet and they do not like change.
 Most of the people who are old,like   
 children if they are quiet and polite.
 They are home loving people and do not
 go out frequently and then they would 
 go out in their car.The people enjoy  
 their village and want to keep        
 peaceful and quiet.                   
                                       
              Life Style.              
 In Maidencombe most of the people are 
 elderley and not really interested in 
 fashion.They like to spend their time 
 relaxing in their home but they do    
 watch T.V and listen to the music on  
 the radio.                            
 If the people wanted to go to a club  
 or cinema they would have to go       
 outside the area.                     </content>
