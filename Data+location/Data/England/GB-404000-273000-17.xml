		<title>17THE MIDLAND BUS MUSEUM</title>
		<content>  This Museum by the church is run by  
 interested volunteers.We set out from 
 the Museum in Wythall on an old open  
 double-decker bus. We sat upstairs    
 until it started to rain.The bus went 
 up Station Rd., along Alcester Rd.,   
 the Expressway and back round to      
 Wythall Church.Entrance fee was 75p.  
 adults and 40p. children.Some very old
 buses had been rescued from scrap and 
 one old bus had been a caravan.Some of
 the makes were Guys,Daimlers and      
 Leyland.One bus which my Dad could    
 remember from the West Country was    
 used around Lyme Regis and even round 
 Sidmouth.One old open double-decker   
 was about{60 years}old.All these old  
 buses have been restored in the       
 workshops at the Museum. It is open on
 the fourth Sunday.The conductor takes 
 your money like long ago.{Meadow Green
