  We looked at Old Hall farm close to  
Bagnall to find out how the farmer     
spent his time.                        
  The farm is owned by Mr and Mrs Brown
and has 80 acres of land.The farm was  
built in the 1700's and five people    
live on the farm,looking after 80 dairy
cattles.                               
  The cattle need constant attention   
being milked twice a day, 6am in the   
morning and 6pm at night.In the Summer 
after milking they have to cut the     
grass for silage.                      
  In the Spring they have to roll and  
harrow and then fertilize the land     
before they sow the grass.             
  In the Autumn they take the cows in  
for Winter and plough the land while   
in Winter they do repair work and      
general cleaning.                      
                                       </content>
