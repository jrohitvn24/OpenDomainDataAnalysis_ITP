		<title>15TREES &amp; HEDGEROWS</title>
		<content>   We have studied the hedgerows of the
 area and have found some interesting  
  information.The hedges appear to be  
 at least 600 years old and probably   
 older,we discovered this by counting  
 the number of tree varieties.In this  
 main we found{oak, beech ,hazel ,     
{sycamore,chestnut &amp; elm}.The hedgerows
 developed over the years because the  
 farmers ploughed their fields &amp; found 
 stones that they didn't want,they     
 piled these to the side.The piles were
 used to contain grazing  animals.Trees
 grew from piles &amp; hedgerows grew in   
 their shelter.The hedgerows protect   
 some wild life , attracting insects   
 which attract birds &amp; other creatures.
 In some areas the hedgerows are pulled
 down to allow more room for machines  
 to work in fields,but not in our area.
 Individual trees of the species       
 mentioned grow large in the valley.   </content>
