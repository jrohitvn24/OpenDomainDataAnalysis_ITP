		<content>  Sunderland posseses a retailing      
 centre of sufficient size and         
 diversity to provide for the basic    
 needs of the town's 300,000           
 population.It also serves a limited   
 hinterland of 5/10 miles from the city
 centre.                               
   Most high street chainstores are    
 present, but specialist shops         
 providing high order and luxury goods 
 are conspicuous by their absence. This
 reflects the high unemployment and    
 relative poverty of the town, and also
 the proximity of Newcastle.Recently   
 the town centre has experienced the   
 arrival of certain new shops, and     
 shows every sign of being a thriving  
 retail centre.                        
   Away from the centre low order goods
 are available from small shops to     
 serve the local population.
