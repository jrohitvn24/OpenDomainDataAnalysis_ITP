		<content> Combrook is one of only two           
 settlements in the "D Block" and the  
 only one which lies entirely within   
 it.It has a population of             
 approximately 150 housed in the       
 attractive terraced or detached       
 cottages of Eastwold limestone,under  
 thatched or slated roofs,or one of the
 modern bungalows or houses.Some       
 villagers inevitably still rely upon  
 the land for their livelihood,but the 
 number is steadily diminishing.A short
 journey of some two miles takes some  
 residents to Kineton,where shops,     
 offices,and small industrial units    
 provide some work.Wellesbourne a      
 rapidly expanding village some four   
 miles away provides similar           
 employment.Combrook is a village which
 attracts people wishing to live in an 
 attractive rural community,but going  
 by car to work elsewhere.             </content>
