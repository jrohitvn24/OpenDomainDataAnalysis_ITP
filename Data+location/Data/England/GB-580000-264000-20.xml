		<content>  Designated "parkland" class, it has  
an 18-hole course. The standard scratch
score is 72, the length just over 6800 
yards with the usual hazards of        
undergrowth, bunkers and trees. The    
addition of water hazards is being     
considered.                            
  Founded in the 1920s, originally the 
railway ran through it. When the       
inproved A45 was built and the town    
required land for the Howard housing   
estate, part of the course was         
compulsorily purchased, this being     
replaced by buying farmland. A new     
clubhouse was built, to which 2 squash 
courts have recently been added.       
Businessmen entertain clients to meals 
there in pleasant surroundings without 
parking problems. There are about 700  
golf, squash and social members, of    
whom about 300 play golf regularly.
