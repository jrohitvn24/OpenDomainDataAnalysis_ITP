		<title>17EAMONT BRIDGE</title>
		<content> A hamlet 1.5m S of Penrith where the  
 A6 crosses the River Eamont by a      
 single-track 3 arched sandstone bridge
 once the Cumberland/Westmorland       
 boundary, before climbing Kemplay Bank
 northwards to the town. A mixture of  
 vernacular and classic style buildings
 from 18th C.to modern, displaying     
 different materials and techniques.   
 Most buildings flank the A6, a less   
 busy northern route since M6 was built
 and used mainly by local and tourist  
 traffic. Fewer buildings spread at    
 right angles along the river towards  
 the former mill. There is a P.O. an   
 inn, an hotel, a joiners, an office, a
 repair garage, a chicken farm and a   
 small hauliers. In the vicinity is a  
 henge monument, remains of an         
 impressive castellated hall with a    
 preserved C of E chapel adjacent.
