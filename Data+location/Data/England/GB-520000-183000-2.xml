		<content>{Willesden Junction}is a very old      
 station with a high level line for the
 North London Line and a low level for 
 local trains.It has 5 platforms but it
 used to have 17.Many people think that
 the North London Line is new but it   
 has been there for{100 years.}It was  
 re-launched in May 1985.A new bridge  
 was built for it in 1980 and B.R. are 
 putting on new trains.                
 Willesden is also the main junction   
 for goods train travelling{North.     
 During the day most people use the    
 Watford-Euston line ,many changing at 
 Queen's Park.The peak time train      
 from Watford to Broad Street goes to  
 Liverpool Street instead, as Broad St.
 is being closed.                      
 A survey was done and we found that   
 66% of passengers used rail to get to 
 work.55% use it daily. Finally, 38%   
 said that the service was good.       </content>
