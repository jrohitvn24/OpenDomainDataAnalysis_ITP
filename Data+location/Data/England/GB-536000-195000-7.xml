		<title>07Wright's Flour Mill 1</title>
		<content> Wright's Flour Mill was founded by    
 George Reynolds Wright.The east mill  
 dates back to Queen Anne's time.In    
 that time there was no electricity so 
 the mill was worked by two water      
 wheels.These provided power to drive  
 seven pairs of mill stones.It was     
 known then as Flanders Mill;renamed in
 the 18th century Enfield Mill.Once    
 more in 1850 its name was changed to  
 Ponders End Mill.For many years       
 Ponders End Mill was one of many      
 mills,now only two are working.In 1880
 the premises were partly rebuilt and  
 five new pairs of mill stones were    
 added.A steam engine was installed to 
 drive them.150 years ago the only     
 transport for sacks was a horse drawn 
 cart which could pull up to forty     
 sacks (5 tonnes)>
