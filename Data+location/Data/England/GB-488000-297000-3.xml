		<title>03Farming Practices in Rutland</title>
		<content>    Cultivation on Rutland farms is    
 highly mechanised and technical, with 
 the usage of fertilizer and pesticide 
 being carefully calculated to allow   
 optimum benefit. Chemical fertilizers 
 are widely used because of their      
 convenience, but manure is also       
 popular as many farmers appreciate the
 way it benefits soil structure.       
 Farmers may treat certain crops in a  
 particular way to meet specific       
 customer requirements.                
                                       
    Machines include tractors, muck    
 spreaders, chemical sprayers, harrows,
 seed drills and combine harvesters.   
 Most farmers are adept at the repair, 
 maintenance and modification of       
 machinery. Members of the family      
 usually supply labour on each farm.
