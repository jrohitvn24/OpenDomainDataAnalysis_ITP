		<content>      The village of Barwell developed 
 as a near relative to the larger town 
 of Hinckley . The area became well    
 known for its manufacture of footwear 
 and hosiery.                          
      As these industries have declined
 so the character of the village has   
 changed. Many of the old factories    
 have been taken over and used by small
 companies producing a range of goods. 
 Many lie empty.                       
      With the improvement in road     
 travel the village has expanded to    
 accomodate new housing estates of     
 commuters and small supply industries 
 which have speedy access to the       
 motorway network via the M69 motorway.
