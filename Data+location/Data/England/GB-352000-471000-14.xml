		<title>14STATION HOUSE BORWICK</title>
		<content>{Borwick station}is about 1 mile from  
{Borwick Hall.}The station is closed   
 down but the trains still go by.The   
{Hammet family}have lived in the old   
 station for{17}years and the ticket   
 office is next door.There is another  
 house like it which was built to be   
 the original station,but was built in 
 the wrong place so the{Hammet's}house 
 was built.The{Griffith's}live next    
 door at{Roland House.}Their house used
 to be a train shed where the trains   
 were kept and repaired.Next door to   
 them is Kitson House which used to be 
 a school.Sometimes in the Summer steam
 engines go by like the{"Flying        
{Scotsman."
