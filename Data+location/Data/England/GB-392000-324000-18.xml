      On Saturday 15th June we had a   
Summer Fayre at our school.  At half   
past one it was the fancy dress and my 
friend won dressed up as on old lady.  
Then at 2 o.clock the gymnasts did     
their part.  I am in the gymnastics    
 with my friend.  Then at 2.30 the     
country dancers performed.  At 3       
o.clock it was the " knockout" in      
which  my  friend took part.           
      There were lots of things to have
a go on like the bouncy castle, the    
ponies, children's motor bikes and     
there were lots of stalls like the     
cake stall and the plant stall.  There 
was a place which sold tea and coffee. 
The tea just tasted like plain warm    
water and you couldn't have two lumps  
of sugar with your coffee.
