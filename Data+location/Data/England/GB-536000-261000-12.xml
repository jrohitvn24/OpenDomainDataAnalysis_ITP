		<title>12QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY</title>
		<content>    To us the most interesting question
 on our questionnaire was "Is Bar Hill 
 a true village?".Our sample was split,
 49% saying"Yes",48% saying"No" and 3% 
 saying"Don't know".Going by the       
 reasons people gave for their answers 
 it was quite plain to us that they did
 not really know what a village is or  
 how to define one.We also found it    
 difficult to find a definite          
 definition of a village,so we wrote to
 several local experts asking them for 
 their definitions of the village.In   
 their replies they all told us that   
 they had found the task difficult but 
 in each case gave us a list of        
 amenities that they felt a settlement 
 should have to be called a village.   
 Interestingly each list was           
 different.However from these lists we 
 developed our own definition.
