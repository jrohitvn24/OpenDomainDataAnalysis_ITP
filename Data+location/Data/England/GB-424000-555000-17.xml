		<content> Leisure facilities in Birtley include 
 a library, swimming baths, Bingo Hall,
 a snooker club, tennis court, a       
 bowling green, several public houses, 
 and a community centre.               
    A new Youth Centre is to be opened 
 at Lord Lawson Comprehensive School.  
 Improvements are being made at the    
 swimming baths, a water slide has been
 added and playthings have been        
 introduced.                           
    It is felt that there is not enough
 for young people to do and more Youth 
 Clubs, Adventure play areas, sports   
 fields and a cinema would be an       
 improvement.                          
    There is a jazz band, the Birtley  
 Grenadiers, which is very popular and 
 entertaining.                         
    In years to come Birtley is        
 scheduled to have a new district      
 Leisure Centre.                       </content>
