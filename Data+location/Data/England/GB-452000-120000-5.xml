		<content>    The original school was set up in  
 1815 in the old building where brushes
 were made.                            
    In 1962 the new one was built. It  
 has a central hall with classrooms,   
 kitchen and office,etc. round the edge
 rather like a honeycomb.              
    The school is divided into three   
 classes at present, there being 79    
 children. The school colours are      
 burgundy, white and grey. There are   
 three teachers, a secretary, a        
 caretaker and a cook. It takes the    
 cook three hours to prepare and cook  
 lunch for everyone. It is quite hard  
 work but she says she enjoys it.      
    The grounds of the school are used 
 for games lessons, environmental      
 studies and play-times.
