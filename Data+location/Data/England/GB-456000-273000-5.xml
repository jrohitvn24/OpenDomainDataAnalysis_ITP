		<content>                                       
   We have a stone mason who lives in  
Yelvertoft. He has lived there for 36  
years. He likes Yelvertoft very much   
because he thinks its a friendly       
village.He is very happy in the house  
he lives in.He gets most of his stone  
from Stafford and cuts it with big     
saws. He works mainly in  Alabaster,   
Marble and Lime-stone.Yelvertoft has   
its own stone, which is very hard, made
mostly of fossils and is found about   
6ft under the ground.It is coloured    
bluey-grey.The blocks that our stone   
mason receives weigh about 3 tons.
