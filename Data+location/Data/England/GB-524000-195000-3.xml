 AT HOME WE HAVE A LOT OF ELECTRICAL   
 APPLIANCES TO HELP US WITH DOMESTIC   
 WORK-WASHING MACHINES THAT WASH DIRTY 
 CLOTHES,TUMBLE DRYERS TO DRY THEM     
 INSTEAD OF HANGING THEM ON A WASHING  
 LINE OUTSIDE IN THE WIND, COOKERS WITH
 GRILLS,OVENS AND HOBS TO HEAT UP OR   
 COOK FOOD,DISHWASHERS FOR DIRTY       
 CUTLERY AND CROCKERY,MICROWAVE OVENS  
 FOR QUICK COOKING(EVEN FROZEN FOOD),  
 REFRIGERATORS TO KEEP FOOD COOL AND   
 FRESH,FREEZERS TO STORE FROZEN FOOD   
 FOR LONG PERIODS, VACUUM CLEANERS TO  
 SUCK UP DUST,FOOD MIXERS FOR EASY     
 PREPARATION OF FOOD,COFFEE AND TEA    
 MAKING MACHINES. MY DAILY ROUTINE IS  
 NOT STRENOUS. ON 5 DAYS A WEEK I GO TO
 SCHOOL FROM 8.45AM TO 3.15PM.WE CAN   
 EAT A MEAL AT LUNCHTIME WHICH IS      
 PREPARED IN THE SCHOOL KITCHEN OR EAT 
 ONE WHICH WE BRING OURSELVES.         </content>
