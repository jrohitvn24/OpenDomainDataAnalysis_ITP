		<title>02A Day in the Life of A Child</title>
		<content>      My name is Caroline Perry. I am 9
 and I live in Knowle. This is about a 
 Wednesday in my life. I get up at     
 8.30am and have a cup of tea. Next I  
 get washed, dressed and have          
 breakfast. I have cereal, brown bread 
 and fruit juice. After, I go to       
 school, we have assembly and next we  
 do English spellings. Next it is      
 playtime when I play with my friends. 
 Sometimes I play games or swap        
 stickers. After we have had           
 Mathematics we do addition,           
 subtraction, times tables and         
 division. At 12 noon we have lunch    
 and afterwards I have choir practice. 
 We are singing Daedalus And Icarus at 
 the moment. After choir we have Art   
 and Craft until home time at 3.30pm.  
 When I go home, have my tea and play. 
 Next I watch T.V. until I go to bed at
 9.00pm.                               </content>
