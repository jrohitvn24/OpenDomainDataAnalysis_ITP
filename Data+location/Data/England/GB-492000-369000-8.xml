		<content> I have interviewed my Gran who lives  
 in{5 Westwood Drive.}She preferred    
 life as it was a few years ago because
 it was much slower and people did not 
 rush around as much as they do today. 
 She also told me that there was not so
 much traffic on the roads. She could  
 remember the celebrations and parties 
 at the end of the war in 1945 clearly.
 She said she will remember recovering 
 from an operation when she looks back 
 on 1985.                              
 I have interviewed Mrs Rilot who is 84
 years old and lives in{Stones' Place. 
 She told me that she became interested
 in politics in 1925. She remembered   
 1945 because it was the end of the    
 second world war. 1965 was not a good 
 year because her husband died. She has
 seen many changes in transport, the   
 amount of money people spend and how  
 people entertain themselves. .        </content>
