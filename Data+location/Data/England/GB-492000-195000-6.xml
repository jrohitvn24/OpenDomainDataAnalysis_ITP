		<title>06AMERSHAM HIGH STREET</title>
		<content> When the railways came in 1894 to what
 we call Amersham-on-the-hill,New,or   
 Top Amersham,most of the amenities,   
 shops and houses were built near the  
 station.This has left Old Amersham    
 largely untouched,with its beautiful  
 High street which still has the annual
 fair granted by charter from King John
 in 1200.                              
 There are many interesting houses,too 
 numerous to mention here.Some have    
 Georgian facades,though they are much 
 older,(Elizabethan wall paintings were
 recently discovered in one.)          
 The market hall was given by squire   
 Drake from Shardeloes in 1682;it was, 
 and still is, used for meetings       
 upstairs,and the covered part         
 underneath has market stalls twice a  
 week.                                 
 Of the 39 shops, 11 were gift,11      
 Antique and 13 dress,with 8 others.   </content>
