		<title>19LIFE IN UPHAM</title>
		<content>    People living in Upham and the     
 surrounding countryside tend to think 
 of it as a haven of peace and quiet.  
 Some of them work in the nearby towns 
 and cities, and so come home to "get  
 away from it all"; others have retired
 to this small, caring community.      
    Those who live and work on the     
 farms strive to make a living from the
 land, in spite of the restrictions    
 enforced at present by The European   
 Economic Community on what may be     
 produced.                             
    Beef and dairy cattle, sheep, pigs,
 horses and free-range poultry are all 
 reared here. Barley, wheat, oats, hay,
 rape, flax and vegetables are all     
 grown.                                
    The fields remain relatively small,
 the hedgerows survive to provide      
 shelter for wildlife, and life goes on
 much as it always has done.           </content>
