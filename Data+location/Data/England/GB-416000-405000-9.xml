		<title>09WEATHER -LOCAL CLIMATE</title>
		<content> The general climate is harsher than   
 nationally.We get more rain,wind and  
 snow;we get less sun and it is cooler.
 The two main villages Hepworth and    
 Jackson Bridge are in sheltered       
 places,which is one reason they       
 developed there. As one walks up from 
 the valley to the top the difference  
 in temperature and exposure is very   
 noticeable."It's a top coat warmer in 
 the valley",they say. The people on   
 higher ground like Hullock thought    
 they got much more  wind.They felt    
 that the wind  meant the rain was     
 worse and the snow drifted more. They 
 thought that they got more sun on     
 the higher ground.These places felt   
 they got a lot of low cloud fog while 
 the lower areas had more ground mist. 
 The people at Snug Lane said that they
 were on the snow line. General opinion
 seemed to be that the wind was worst. </content>
