		<content>  During the lunchtimes and breaktimes 
 in the school day, children may play a
 variety of games either on their own  
 or in groups of gangs.                
                                       
{Chasing Games                         
  A lot of children play chasing games.
 These games vary from area to area,   
 but each game is similar to the basic 
 "tick" game. These games are very     
 exciting because we experience fun as 
 well as fear within the safety of our 
 playground.

{Tick                                  
  We play tick which is a game in which
 one person is "on" and they have to   
 touch another person or persons. Then 
 someone else is the next chaser. Other
 games may involve actions, singing,   
 skipping, rhymes and ball games.
