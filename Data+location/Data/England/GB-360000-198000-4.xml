		<content> The people of Alvington are very      
 poorly catered for as regards their   
 health.  There is no General          
 Practioner in the village, patients   
 have to go to nearby Aylburton or     
 Lydney.  Dentists, Opticians and      
 Chiropodists are all in Lydney.  The  
 nearest hospital is also in Lydney    
 which caters mainly for geriatrics and
 minor surgery.  There are X-Ray,      
 physiotherapy and some casualty       
 facilities plus family planning and   
 out patient clinics and a day centre  
 for the elderly.  All other health    
 care has been centralised at the main 
 Gloucester city hospital, including   
 Obsteterics and maternity care.       
 As part of the Social services meals  
 on wheels are provided twice a week,  
 Tuesdays and Thursdays, for the infirm
 senior citizens.
