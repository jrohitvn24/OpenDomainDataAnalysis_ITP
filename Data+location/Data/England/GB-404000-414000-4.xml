		<content>  Around 70% of the housing is owner-  
 occupied and include both outright    
 owners and those still paying off     
 mortgages.There is a somewhat above   
 average level of private renting in   
 this block with a strong relationship 
 between levels of private renting and 
 the age of the housing stock.         
 About 12% of the houses are Council   
 property.The Longlands Estate on Hill 
 Top comprises of 100 properies built  
 in the 1950's.Approximately one third 
 of these houses have been bought by   
 former tenants and this trend is      
 increasing.                           
 The 1985 Colne Valley Local Plan      
 reports that almost 10% of houses in  
 the Slaithwaite/Marsden area lack such
 basic amenities as a bath,an indoor   
 toilet and hot water:-a proportion    
 higher than anywhere else in Kirklees.
 This situation could get worse.       </content>
