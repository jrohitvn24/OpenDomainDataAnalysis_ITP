		<content>  There are many nurseries closely     
 situated,some growing for distribution
 to wholesalers,and others for direct  
 sale to the public. Glasshouses       
 feature predominantly on the map.     
{ Marlwood Nursery}in Silver Street    
 professes to be a leader in modern    
 methods of producing{cucumbers}.Large 
 glasshouses are packed with cucumbers 
 grown on rockwool, not straw bales,   
 and water and feed are monitored by   
 computer .Computers also control the  
 heating and ventilation, this has     
 obvious advantages but also requires  
 someone to be on site 24 hours a day  
 in case of electrical or gas failure. 
{ Shallowmead Nurseries}near Boldre,   
 situated by the Shallows of Lymington 
 River, specialises in{tomatoes}.There 
 is a total of{15 acres}with 5 quarter 
 acre glasshouses. They have 9 full-   
 time workers and 7 part-time.         </content>
