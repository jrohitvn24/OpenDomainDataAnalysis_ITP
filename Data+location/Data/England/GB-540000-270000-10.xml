		<title>10Gardens in Willingham</title>
		<content> Most front{gardens}are quite small and
 enclosed and contain mainly flowers   
 and shrubs. Because of ribbon         
 development along the main through    
 routes most back gardens in Willingham
 tend to be quite large where they     
 border onto open fields. There is     
 usually an area of lawn and some      
 trees. Many gardens have{vegetable    
{plots,}the main crops being beans,    
 peas, potatoes, beetroot, cabbages,   
 carrots, broccoli and cauliflowers.   
 Soft fruit bushes are also quite      
 common and the soil is very suitable  
 for growing strawberries.             
{Surplus produce}is frequently offered 
 for sale by the garden gate with a tin
 left for the money.                   
 There are some{allotments}to rent from
 the Parish Council.                   
{Greenhouses}abound, including some    
 devoted to commercial growing.        </content>
