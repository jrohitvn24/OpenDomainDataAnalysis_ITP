		<title>02Ecological Study of Belper</title>
		<content>     The weather of the area we studied
 was generally very varied. The average
 rainfall of the Belper area is about  
 28ins.per year.Winter is generally wet
 with variable amounts of snow,        
 sometimes severe with long periods of 
 frost. The last few springs have been 
 cold. The Spring of 1985 was cold and 
 wet. The Summer this year is terrible 
 with dull, cool weather interrupted by
 outbreaks of heavy rain.              
       Lately there has been an        
 increasing interest in conservation as
 population grows and natural          
 vegetation and woodland disappears.   
 Pollution has been uppermost in       
 people's minds as industry grows, car 
 and lorry numbers increase and the air
 becomes more polluted with poisonous, 
 waste gasses.Water picks up these     
 pollutants and it falls as acid rain. 
 Belper has one of the highest levels. </content>
