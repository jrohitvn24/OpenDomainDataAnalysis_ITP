		<content>{Hawley Lake}is an extensive area owned
 by the Crown but it is used mainly for
 training by the Royal Engineers (see  
 TRAINING AREAS).On the north side of  
 the lake there are many Army          
 buildings. The rest of the lake is    
 surrounded by coniferous woodland and 
 rhododendrons. In wet weather, the    
 surrounding land can become boggy. The
 lake has an area of 16 ha and is      
 fairly shallow. This shallowness      
 causes problems for the sailing club, 
 who use the lake. Sailing can take    
 place at all times in parts of the    
 lake, depending on the Army. There is 
 a boathouse and clubhouse near the    
 Army area. The club is an Army        
 establishment, with higher membership 
 fees for civilians. The lake is also  
 used for fishing, if the anglers have 
 a permit.(See also SAILING).
