		<content> The council maintain the Jubilee      
 Parks, Wigan Road, which cover an area
 of 11 acres.  Near the curved paths   
 are wooden seats and a pavilion.      
 There are neatly tended flower beds   
 surrounded by lawns, colourful shrubs 
 and long-established trees, which also
 form part of a natural area by the 6  
 tennis courts and 9 hole putting      
 green.  The Jack Brook winds its way  
 into the park and under a bridge.     
  In nearby Skitters Wood are sycamore,
 oak, hazel, beech, ash, birch,        
 willow and hawthorn.                  
  The Countryside Commission has       
 sponsored the planting of 25 new      
 varieties of trees.  Down Brook runs  
 through the wood and under a bridge   
 near the main pathways.Here people may
 sit on wooden benches and enjoy the   
 wide variety of wildlife.
