		<title>15   OUR JOURNEY TO SCHOOL</title>
		<content> In the morning at twenty five past    
 eight mummy takes us to the bottom of 
 our half mile long drive where we wait
 for the minibus to take us to school. 
 When there is a lot of ice or snow on 
 the roads we do not go to school but  
 mummy gives us lessons at home. When  
 it is just cold mum takes us straight 
 to school in the car because it is too
 cold to wait. We see lots of          
 interesting things like rivers, big   
 forests and cows grazing in the       
 summer. In winter when it has been    
 raining hard the river is brown and   
 the forests are a brighter green.     
 We are the fourth group on the bus and
 we get to school at 9 o'clock. There  
 are 13 children and the bus is full.  
 Most of us have a special seat but it 
 is not a very comfortable ride because
 we are squashed.                      
                                       </content>
