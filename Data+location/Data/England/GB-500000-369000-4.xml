		<title>04     THE OLD MILL.</title>
		<content>     One hundred and forty-five years  
 ago{Heighington Mill}was beginning to 
 develop.                              
    Mr. Curtis owned the mill and was  
 responsible for its production.       
      The twenty people who worked     
 there were responsible for grinding   
 the corn and making sure the water    
 wheel was working. Sadly the wheel has
 now gone but the mill still remains.  
       Mr.Flavell now lives inside it  
 with his family and his antique shop  
 which is built on the front.          
      When the mill was built it only  
 had three storeys, but when Mr.       
 Flavell bought it he added an antique 
 shop and another storey to the mill   
      The mill stopped production      
 about fifteen years ago.Twenty people 
 worked in the mill and only four of   
 them were women.
