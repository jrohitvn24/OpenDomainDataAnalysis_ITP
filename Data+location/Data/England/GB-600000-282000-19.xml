		<title>19Typical Sunday, N. Lopham</title>
		<content>      I woke up at 8.30 a.m..  I got   
 dressed and went downstairs.  For     
 breakfast we had bacon and eggs.      
 After breakfast my brother, my dad and
 I went to the building site at        
 Wortham.  We are building our own     
 house and we hope to move in soon.  At
 the building site we put the          
 electrical plugs and switches in.  My 
 mum and my sister stayed at home to   
 make cakes.                           
                                       
      When we got back we had lunch - a
 sandwich and a packet of crisps.      
 After lunch we all went upstairs and  
 got our clothes and a washbag to take 
 on holiday with us. (We are going to  
 the Dordogne in France.)  Then we went
 downstairs and had dinner.  For       
 dinner we had roast lamb with potatoes
 and peas.  In the evening we all      
 watched television.                   </content>
