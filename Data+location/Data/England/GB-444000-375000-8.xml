		<title>08WELLDRESSING</title>
		<content> The frames for the well-dressing are  
 made of wood with holes drilled in    
 them so that the clay can be"plugged" 
 to keep it in place.                  
 Ordinary clay is used and this is     
 cleaned by getting the stones out and 
 adding some water to make it soft.The 
 clay is then thrown into the frames   
 and smoothed off to form an even      
 surface.                              
 A Biblical picture,which has          
 previously been drawn on grease proof 
 paper,is placed on the clay and the   
 outline pricked out with a needle.The 
 paper is removed and the outline of   
 holes is covered with wool to form a  
 picture on the clay.                  
 Flower petals,greenery and seeds such 
 as sunflower seeds are then used to   
 fill in the picture.Like painting,the 
 colours must be shaded.               
 When finished,the frames are put      </content>
