		<title>09Glympton Park</title>
		<content>A man called Mr Towler owns Glympton   
Village.In front of his house there is 
part of a large beautiful lake.All     
around the lake there is Glympton      
Park.It is all a green lawn kept in    
very good condition.On the edge of the 
lawn there is a little wood.On the edge
of the lake there are a few trees and  
lots of wild flowers.                  
Sometimes we go fishing in the         
lake.First we knock on Mr Towlers door 
and ask his permission.We fish for pike
and trout mainly.You don't have to ask 
permission to go into the park.
