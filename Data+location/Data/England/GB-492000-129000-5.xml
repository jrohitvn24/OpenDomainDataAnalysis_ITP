		<content>  {My name is Nicholas Lunn.}          
 On Sunday the 2nd. of June in the     
 morning I was up Abisters and I was   
 playing with my yoyo.Then I went to   
 have some rice crispies and after, I  
 went to go on the B.B.C. B. micro-    
 computer.The game was Astroids and    
 after that we went to mend Taricks    
 radio controlled car.                 
  Then we rode the B.M.X.bikes and     
 Tarick fell off and cut his hand.We   
 sprayed his platform pedals silver.   
  Then we had a barbeque of steak,     
 chicken and garlic bread.For afters   
 we had fruit salad .                  
  Then we rode to the stud and rode    
 back again.                           
  We went home to bed at nine o'clock. 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
