		<title>15The Bollin Valley.</title>
		<content>   The main physical geographical      
 feature of the survey area is the     
 River Bollin.The river flows          
 north-west until it reaches the River 
 Mersey.                               
   In the past,the river has been badly
 polluted but,recently,local           
 conservation groups and community     
 awareness has retrieved the situation.
   For many years,various species of   
 birds,animals and fishes were absent  
 from the river,but have now returned. 
   A Bollin Valley Project was begun in
 order to enable people to discover the
 Bollin Valley landscape and heritage, 
 by walking its countryside,villages   
 and towns.During the summer of 1985   
 various guided walks took place,led   
 by voluntary leaders from various     
 societies in the area.It is hoped to  
 continue and enlarge the project in   
 1986.                                 </content>
