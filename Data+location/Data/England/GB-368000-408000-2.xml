		<title>02VICTORIA SQUARE  BOLTON</title>
		<content> This large open space,in front of the 
 Town Hall, has been pedestrianised and
 is even more important as a focus for 
 the town's people.Every week day      
 people sit on the benches and chat    
 whilst others hurry to and fro between
 the shops and offices. The area is    
 often used for advertising, displays  
 and exhibitions. There are vans       
 selling double glazing,giving public  
 information or supporting charities.  
 Displays by morris dancers, brass     
 bands and youth organisations fill the
 square with music and laughter. At    
 Christmas there is carol singing, on  
 Remembrance Day a parade, and in late 
 Summer a street fair. On special      
 occasions the Mayor comes down the    
 Town Hall steps, such as when Bolton  
 welcomes officials from its twin towns
 of Le Mans in France and Paderborn in 
 West Germany.                         </content>
