		<content>     {****** Parishes ******           
    This year the Reverend Tyler is    
 retiring from being Rector of Ickham, 
 Wickhambreaux, and Stodmarsh. Sadly he
 is not going to be replaced. These    
 three parishes are now joining        
 Littlebourne.                         
     Stodmarsh joined Wickhambreaux in 
 October 1930. Ickham joined           
 Wickhambreaux and Stodmarsh in        
 December 1965. Most of the area is    
 in the civil parish of Wickhambreaux, 
 which includes the ecclesiastical     
 parishes of Stodmarsh and             
 Wickhambreaux.                        
   { ****** Local Radio ******         
 During the 1980's a radio mast was    
 erected at Swanton Farm. There was    
 much discussion as to where it should 
 go, some conservationists thinking it 
 would spoil the beauty of the area.
