		<title>17BRANDON WOOD, COVENTRY.</title>
		<content>   Brandon Wood                        
 was in bad shape. A                   
 man decided to get a group together to
 reconstruct the wood. He called this  
 group the{"Friends of Brandon Wood".  
 There are many members, and           
 householders can join for the sum of  
 50p. A few of the members meet in the 
 wood every Sunday  morning. They can  
 go when they want to.                 
   They have built bridges, cleared    
 paths and re_established ponds. They  
 have also made ditches and good       
 drainage systems,which all help in    
 case of fire.                         
   Horses and motorbikes sometimes get 
 through the fences that have been put 
 up. The group don't like this because 
 they churn up all the mud.            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
