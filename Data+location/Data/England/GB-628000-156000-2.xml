		<title>02WOODNESBOROUGH CHURCH</title>
		<content> Woodnesborough church was built in    
1180.In the church there is a very     
colourful Creation window given to the 
church by A Man of Kent.It was made by 
a man named F.W Cole,who is in charge  
of all the stained glass windows in    
Canterbury Cathedral,for the Queen's   
Jubilee in 1978. On the pillars in the 
church there are markings which are    
thought to be pilgrims markings.       
 From the top of the tower we could see
Ash tower,Worth tower and St Peter's   
church tower in Sandwich.By lining up  
the towers in Sandwich and Woodnesboro'
ships at sea knew when to turn in to   
Sandwich harbour.In the churchyard we  
were shown the body-stone of the giant 
of Woodnesborough it took up the length
of two children.In the church are two  
grave-markers which pre-date the Norman
Conquest. It is thought that Woden was 
worshipped here in pagan times.        </content>
