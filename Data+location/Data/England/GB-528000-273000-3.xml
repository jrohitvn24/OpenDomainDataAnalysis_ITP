		<title>03Nature in N.St Ives.</title>
		<content> In and around St.Ives there are a lot 
 of fields but most of it is farmers'  
 land.There are some foot paths around 
 Houghton.There are not that many      
 hedges because farmers have chopped   
 them down for more space for their    
 crops.The people who live here do not 
 think this is a good idea as much     
 wildlife is destroyed.Also people are 
 concerned about the spraying of       
 chemicals on crops.It is quiet most of
 the time,although the aircraft from   
 RAF Wyton can cause quite a           
 disturbance.                          
  There are a few woods about          
 like Crows Wood or the Spinny but you 
 couldn't get lost in them because they
 are too small.                        
 Small animals found in the area       
 include rabbits,hares,hedgehogs,rats, 
 squirrels.
