		<title>10BLACKMORE VALE VEGETATION</title>
		<content> These large open fields have in the   
 main been cleared of trees to make    
 ploughing more practical.The hedgerows
 are planted mostly with blackthorn,   
 hawthorn and hazel bushes but have    
 some fine oak and beech trees planted 
 in them.One area of about 12 acres of 
 cultivated woodland has mostly oak and
 ash trees but there is also an area of
 newly planted beech saplings protected
 from rabbits by plastic tubes.        
 Dutch elm disease killed many fine    
 trees in this area most of which have 
 been cut down.There is very little    
 evidence of replanting.               
 As many fields are re-seeded with     
 grass every two or three years the    
 wild flowers have become much scarcer.
 Few poppies or ragwort but hedgerows  
 still support the bramble,wild rose,  
 honeysuckle,clematis,stinging and     
 dead-nettles,comfrey and scabious.    </content>
