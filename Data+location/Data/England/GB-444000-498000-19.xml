		<title>19COD BECK RESERVOIR</title>
		<content> Cod Beck reservoir G.R.467990 lies in 
 one of the glacial overflow channels  
 of the North York Moors to the north  
 of Osmotherley.Work began on the      
 reservoir in 1948 and was completed in
 1953.Before that date Osmotherley's   
 water supply came from springs on     
 Ruebury hill and was piped to taps in 
 the village.The reservoir was built   
 by the Northallerton and District     
 Water Board as the supply from the    
 Oakdale reservoirs was insufficient to
 meet the demand of Northallerton and  
 surrounding district. The water is    
 treated at the filter station in      
 Osmotherley.Water is pumped to the    
 reservoirs in Osmotherley and put into
 supply by gravity.It is also sent to  
 the reservoirs of Northallerton. Cod  
 Beck covers an area of 24 acres and   
 has a capacity of 115 million gallons,
 average daily output of 924,000 galls.</content>
