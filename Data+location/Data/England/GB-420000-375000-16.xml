		<title>16ATTITUDES OF THREE LADIES.</title>
		<content> We are doing a survey about the type  
 of likes and dislikes about Eyam.We   
 interviewed three ladies from the     
 village. One has been living here all 
 of her life, one has been living here 
 a good number of years and the other  
 lady moved to Eyam in 1984. We wrote  
 out a letter to ask if we could       
 interview them about Eyam. We walked  
 to their houses but one lady came to  
 school for us to interview her here.  
 These are the questions we asked.     
{1.Do you think there ought to be any  
{changes in Eyam / if so what changes? 
{2. Do you like living in Eyam ? why/  
{whynot/                               
{3.Do you find enough things happening 
{in Eyam?                              
{4.Would you like to live elsewhere, if
{so where?                             
{5.Did you live elsewhere before you   
{lived here? }                         </content>
