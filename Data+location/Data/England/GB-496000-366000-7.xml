{The tip covering 15 acres,is the      
{largest in Lincolnshire.}On the site  
 of a former clay pit,20 metres deep in
 parts,fossils can be easily found.    
 It handles approx.120,000 tons of     
 household and industrial waste each   
 year.{Some}waste is sorted and scrap  
 metal can be sold.{Skips}are provided 
 for public to dispose of waste not    
 collected by dustbin men.Most waste is
 brought on Sunday,Spring and Autumn   
 are busy times when garden waste is   
 plentiful.{TIPPING}is the cheapest    
 form of disposal.{Burning}would cost 4
 times as much.{The}rubbish is packed  
 down by a big tractor weighing 20 tons
 with spiked steel wheels.{When rubbish
 reaches desired level it is covered   
 with clay on top of which grass is    
 grown.                                
                                       </content>
