		<title>07      Plessey Radar</title>
		<content>     On Monday 15th July Simon, Noel,  
 Lynden and I went to Plessey Radar, in
 West Cowes.  My dad took us in the    
 car.                                  
     First we had to go to the         
 security box and put our names down in
 a book, and they gave us a sticker.   
 The sticker said, "Visiting Mr Dobbs".
 When we got to his office Lynden and  
 Simon asked him some questions and    
 then we asked him ours.  Here are our 
 questions:                            
   1). Which Radar did they make first?
              {AR 1 Radar}             
   2). How many people do you employ?  
              {1250}                   
   3). How many Radars have you had?   
{                70}                   
   4). How much do they cost to run?   
              {about Â£3 million}       
                                       
                                       </content>
