		<content> St.Helens school is a primary school  
 near Bristol.There are ten classes in 
 the school and about 310 children.We  
 have a very large playing field and a 
 football pitch and an outdoor swimming
 pool which we only use on very warm   
 days.There are two playgrounds one    
 junior and the other an infant        
 playground.The roof of the school     
 always has a leak in it somewhere.In  
 class ten we had a leak in the roof.It
 came down onto the boards under the   
 roof and the boards held the water    
 then it fell down.There is a big hall 
 for assembly and dinner.The school has
 a little wood in its grounds.Our class
 is doing a survey on it and we are    
 trying to make a wildlife area in it  
 so that people may come and see it.At 
 the bottom of our field there is a    
 boundary made out of trees and bushes 
 which is over a thousand years old.   </content>
