		<title>05A TEACHER'S VIEW WOODINGDEAN</title>
		<content> Travelling into work to Woodingdean is
 almost impossible without a           
 car.Driving into the area in winter,is
 frequently hazardous,and when it      
 snows,Woodingdean becomes very quickly
 cut off.                              
  An "outsiders'" view of Woodingdean  
 is that the area is very much part of 
 Brighton,but the people of Woodingdean
 feel that they are a village          
 community.                            
  It is frequently windy,Woodingdean   
 being about four hundred feet above   
 sea level,and the sea breezes often   
 carry heavy mist over the area.Games  
 lessons often have to be moved        
 indoors,when schools in sheltered     
 areas are enjoying pleasant weather.  
  The views that most residents enjoy  
 from their windows and gardens,of     
 sea,downs and the town of Brighton,and
 its racecourse are breathtaking.      </content>
