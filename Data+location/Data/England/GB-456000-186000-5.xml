		<title>05Transport: trains</title>
		<content>{Trains} are used to transport goods   
and people around the country. A       
locomotive pulls a train of carriages  
or wagons on rails. Locomotives have   
diesel, diesel electric or gas turbine 
engines. {High speed trains,} powered  
by gas turbines, pass non-stop through 
Cholsey. These are fast trains which   
go east to London or west to Wales and 
the South West. Slower, stopping trains
will also call at Didcot making        
connections to many other parts of the 
country. Before diesel electric power, 
trains were pulled by steam engines    
but they are not so economical. At     
present steam trains are used only for 
pleasure. The old Wallingford to       
Cholsey line is now being restored by  
the Cholsey and Wallingford Railway    
Preservation Society and an old steam  
engine has been bought, to be          
renovated prior to use on the track.   </content>
