		<title>20THE BASE HANGAR</title>
		<content> The{base hangar}was built in 1967, it 
 was the largest hangar in{Europe}and  
 cost 50 million pounds. It is 90 feet 
 tall and covers over 5 acres and holds
 6 aeroplanes. If about eight inches   
 of snow falls, the workers would have 
 to get on the roof with safety        
 harnesses and get the snow off because
 there is a danger of the{cantilevered 
{roof}collapsing. The roof is made out 
 of{3100}tons of steel and it is held  
 together by{250,000}bolts. There are  
 several different bays in which       
 workers inspect and fix parts of      
 aeroplanes. There is underfloor       
 heating but,in Winter,it is bitterly  
 cold with the main doors open. They   
 sometimes remove the front section of 
 a plane to fit it in the hangar.
