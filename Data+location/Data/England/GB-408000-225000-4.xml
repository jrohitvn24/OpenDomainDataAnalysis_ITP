		<content> In our block the majority of the      
 people are either retired. There are  
 about 121 people of whom 14 only are  
 children under 16 years of age.       
 This is because very few people with  
 children can afford to buy houses as  
 people who have lived most of their   
 lives elsewhere are willing to pay    
 very high prices in order to retire to
 the country.                          
 Many of the local families are related
 to each other in some way and most    
 have been to Temple Guiting School.   
 One pupil,Nicky Brown, searched the   
 records of the school and found that  
 at least 48 of his relations have     
 attended the school since it opened in
 1873 included a Great-great Aunt, Mary
 Hitchman, who started at school on the
 day it opened.
