		<title>20HOW CARLISLE IS CHANGING</title>
		<content> &lt;summary of an interview with town    
 planners at the Civic Centre>         
  Carlisle has changed very much in the
 last twenty years.Near Willow Holme   
 large areas were demolished to make   
 room for through roads.Housing estates
 in outer suburbs have grown rapidly.  
 New schools,the Cumberland General    
 Infirmary and local govt. offices have
 been built.Just outside this block    
 are a large new shopping centre and a 
 big sports centre,also new.           
  Carlisle has a new town plan for the 
 next tn years.It is based on two      
 assumptions:the city will not grow as 
 fast,but there will not be any great  
 loss of jobs.In this block,the main   
 task will be to fill in empty sites.  
 Older estates near the town centre may
 be renewed.The plan now is to improve 
 housing and shopping facilities and to
 preserve Carlisle's historic buildings</content>
