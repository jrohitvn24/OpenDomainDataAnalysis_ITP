		<title>15A SANDY CUB PACK</title>
		<content>  I AM EIGHT YEARS OLD AND I AM IN THE 
 SAXON'S CUB PACK, IT IS GREAT FUN.    
 CUBS IS ON TUESDAY EVENINGS FROM SEVEN
 O'CLOCK UNTIL HALF PAST EIGHT. I AM IN
 GREY SIX. WE HAVE A SIXER WHO IS THE  
 LEADER, AND A SECONDER.               
  THE UNIFORM IS A CAP, SHORTS, BLACK  
 SHOES, TRIANGULAR SCARF AND WOGGLE,   
 LONG GREY SOCKS, GARTERS AND A JUMPER.
 WE HAVE TO WORK FOR BADGES. I HAVE TWO
 BADGES, THEY ARE ARTIST AND FIRST AID.
  LOTS OF THE BOYS IN MY CLASS GO TO   
 CUBS BUT THEY BELONG TO DIFFERENT     
 PACKS. I AM GOING TO JOIN THE GUIDE   
 AND SCOUT BAND. IT IS THE BEST        
 ACTIVITY THAT I DO AFTER SCHOOL.
