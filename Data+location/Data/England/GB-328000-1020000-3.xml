		<title>03INTERVIEW:  DOUNBY TEACHER</title>
		<content> Mrs.Esson is a teacher at{Dounby      
{Primary School.}She has been teaching 
 since 1966, her first school being    
 Cuminestown near Turriff where she    
 taught for two years. She then came   
 back to Orkney and taught at Papdale  
 Primary in Kirkwall for two and a half
 years before moving to the old Dounby 
 School. The old school had two        
 buildings with two rooms each. They   
 were called Horsa Huts (wartime       
 buildings) and housed 70 to 80 pupils.
 She has worked at the new school since
 it opened in 1976. The new school is  
 bigger, modern, has carpets, a lot    
 more equipment and also far more      
 pupils. It also has many more visiting
 teachers. In the next 20 years she    
 sees teaching becoming more           
 "Computerised" but hopes there will   
 still be a place for books, jotters   
 and pencils.                          </content>
