		<title>17SCHOOL FETE IN EMSWORTH</title>
		<content> Every year St.James' School has a     
 SUMMER FETE with stalls and displays. 
 We bring in books,tins and any other  
 objects needed to help raise money for
 the school.During school hours        
 teachers prepare displays for us to   
 perform.                              
 We had a vaulting display and also    
 this year we had a keep-fit display.  
 There were two special appearances;   
 one was by Emsworth Shotokan Karate   
 Club and the other was by the T.S.    
 Unity Band.                           
 There were stalls selling plants,     
 books,old records,cakes and           
 refreshments.We also had side-shows   
 such as skittles,the nerve tester,    
 sponge throwing and face painting.    
 We raised about{Â£600}which is going   
 towards buying school equipment which 
 all pupils benefit by.
