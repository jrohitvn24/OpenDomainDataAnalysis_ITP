		<title>05ECOLOGY OF GERRICK AREA</title>
		<content>    This moorland area supports meadow 
 and rock pippets, red grouse,         
 pheasant, wheatear, curlew and        
 skylarks. Herring gulls and lesser    
 black-backed gulls are also frequently
 seen. The heather, purple in August,  
 offers little break to the strong,    
 predominantly S.W. winds. Sheep keep  
 the moorland grass short. The walker  
 has to beware the adder.              
    Foxes and rabbits inhabit the area,
 taking shelter in the bracken and     
 heather.                              
    The area has below average rainfall
 but has frequent strong winds. Snow   
 rarely falls before Christmas. Road   
 marker posts enable snow clearance    
 from an otherwise featureless moor.   
    Beekeepers move their hives on to  
 the heather in August.                
    Red deer, from the woodlands to the
 north, can be seen grazing sometimes. </content>
