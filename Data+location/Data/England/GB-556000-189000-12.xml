		<title>12HOUSING: WARLEY, ESSEX</title>
		<content>   There is a{wide range}of housing    
 types within the area, although house 
 prices are extremely high by national 
 standards and are also rising faster  
 than the national average (at about   
 11-15% p.a.). Great Warley 583907 is a
 village containing{cottage style      
 properties, complete with weather     
 boarding. These also occur at 594896. 
 There are some large{farm houses}such 
 as Boyle's Court 578915 and Codham    
 Hall 587890. The Green Belt also      
 contains{large detached houses}e.g. at
 577900, whose value would be even     
 higher were it not for the noise from 
 the M25. In contrast the area around  
 the Ford Offices at Warley 594915 is  
 mostly{housing estate -}some of it    
{council}owned, some of it blocks of   
 flats - although there is some older  
 cottage style and{terraced}property   
 along the B186 in Warley.             </content>
