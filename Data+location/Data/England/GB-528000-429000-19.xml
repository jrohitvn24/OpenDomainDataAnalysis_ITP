		<content> The first school in Roos was called   
 the "Boys School".It was opened prior 
 to 1863.In 1866 girls joined.Then a   
 new building was built on nearby land 
 given by Lady Hotham,who said the     
 school must be called{Roos Church of  
{England Primary School.}This building,
 in the centre of the village was begun
 on 3rd July 1872,and was used for a   
 century.It was then found to be too   
 small with poor facilities and a new  
 modern open-plan school was built in  
 1981.The pupils and staff moved in on 
 January 4th.1982.The school was built 
 for 90 pupils,but at present the roll 
 is 80.The new school is on the        
 northern outskirts of the main part of
 the village.It has good facilities    
 including a large playground and      
 playing field.
