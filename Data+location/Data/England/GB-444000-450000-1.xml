		<title>01A General Review, Tockwith.</title>
		<content>    Our block, referred to as{         
{Tockwith,}includes the three villages 
 Tockwith, Bickerton and               
{Bilton-in-Ainsty.}The surrounding area
 is mainly agricultural land with      
 scattered farms. The area is in the { 
{Vale of York}and is very flat.        
    The centres of the three villages  
 are generally old houses with some    
 in-filling of small new developments. 
 In addition,{Tockwith}has a very large
 new private housing estate which      
 greatly outnumbers the houses in the  
 old village.                          
    {Tockwith}is the centre for social 
 and recreational activities in the    
 block. The majority of children come  
 to{Tockwith CE Primary School}between 
 the ages of 5 and 11. Younger children
 can attend a Pre-school Play Group in{
{Tockwith. }
