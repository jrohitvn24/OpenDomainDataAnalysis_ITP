		<title>15CASTLE HILL &amp; PREHISTORY</title>
		<content>    Situated in parkland on the Ewell  
 side of Chessington (Rollesby Rd.),   
 Castle Hill is now little more than a 
 mound of earth.                       
                                       
    It is in fact a{prehistoric fort}  
 (which may explain the finding of a   
{neolithic axe}2km west of here in     
 1962). The crest of the mound measures
 40m. along its northern face (nearest 
 the road), but is much wider in the   
 south (70m.)  There is a prominence   
 in the SE corner.                     
                                       
     By far the most interesting side  
 is the western one; here the Bonesgate
 Stream &amp; its steep valley are built   
 into the design as a natural ditch &amp;  
 moat.  Even today, the rampart on this
 side is sheer. It is 15m. high,       
 whereas the 'walls' reach no more than
 2 or 3m. on the other 3 sides.        </content>
