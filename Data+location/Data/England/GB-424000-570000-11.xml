people have own flats, a warden and    
communal area.Warden knew Wideopen     
when she came on hiking parties. There 
was the odd shop and the Travellers'   
Rest Pub which some recall being       
called Mary Gallons. She sold tired    
miners cider and sandwiches and gave   
hay and water to cart horses. The      
Children's park is site of quarry and  
the home is where the old Quarry House 
was.Local walls are of stone from this 
quarry.Co-op store was Reno picture    
house. There were only 4 buses a day.  
Residents remembered war-time rations; 
e.g. 8oz of meat a week.Another        
resident was a mounted policeman and   
then a motor patrol   moving every 4   
or 5 years. You could only get married 
after 5 years in the police. He        
remembers Wideopen as a small village. </content>
