		<content>   At 7:56 I get up,put on my school   
 uniform and go to breakfast at 8:00. I
 usually eat a bowl of Frosties or     
 bread and marmalade with a cup of tea.
 At 8:25 I go upstairs,clean my teeth, 
 comb my hair and put my shoes on,then 
 I pack my bag,and walk to school at   
 8:45. School begins at 8:55 ;after the
 register we have assembly when we     
 sing,have a story and say some        
 prayers. Then we return to our        
 classroom to collect our equipment for
 maths.After maths we put our things   
 away and go out to play.In the summer 
 we go out on the school field and in  
 the winter the playground.            
   At 10:45 we come back into our      
 classroom. We then have English until 
 12:00,after which the 11+ children    
 have French and the 10+ have music,   
 nature or drama. We go to lunch from  
 12:25 onward depending on our turn.   </content>
