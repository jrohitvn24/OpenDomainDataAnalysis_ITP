		<content> These are ancient woods. It covers 56 
 acres. The trees are mainly deciduous.
 The House was originally owned by Sir 
 Philip Boteler and was built between  
 1540-1545.  Before the House there was
 a monastery on the site which was     
 built before 1088. Herts County       
 Council purchased the land in 1972.   
 The nature reserve was started in     
 1974. Mrs. Daphne Coates has been the 
 warden since 1975 when the studies    
 centre was built. The centre is used  
 by schools from North Herts and       
 Stevenage. Because it is a large wood 
 there are a lot of birds and animals  
 in it e.g. badger, fox, rabbit, deer, 
 squirrels and many different birds.   
 The Herts and Middlesex Trust for     
 Nature Conservation help to look after
 the wood and plan its future          
 development to maintain healthy trees 
 and plenty of wild flowers.           </content>
