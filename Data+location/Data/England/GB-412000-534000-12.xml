		<title>12Woodifield Farm.</title>
		<content> Part of the area that we looked at    
 contained Woodifield Farm.The farm    
 takes its name possibly from Woden's  
 field and it is believed that a Roman 
 building was on the site where the    
 farm now stands.                      
 The farm is at the top of Pea Hill and
 to the North of Fir Tree.The          
 surrounding land slopes away in every 
 direction which makes it an ideal     
 place for viewing the countryside.The 
 land belonging to the farm ranges from
 525feet above sea level to a height of
 750 feet,a distance of 225 feet over a
 half mile distance.                   
 Apart from the Dairy herd of Friesan  
 cattle the fields are used for hay for
 feed during the winter which, can be  
 rather hard with heavy falls of snow.
