		<content>{PUBLIC HOUSES NEAR DUNSMORE           
 There are only 4 public houses in this
 grid and all have been in existance   
 for many years.{The Halfway House,}an 
 old coaching inn on the A413, halfway 
 from Amersham to Aylesbury, now caters
 for the passing motorist but also     
 brought itself up_to_date with motel  
 facilities. Once a week there is a    
 jazz evening. Dunsmore has 2 pubs.{The
{Fox}keeps the tradition of an English 
 pub, serving bar snacks to the hikers,
 but the{Black Horse,}whilst keeping   
 its licence, has become an up_market  
 restaurant. Almost at the end of a no_
 through road which has wound its way  
 up the hill from the main road, and   
 just beyond the cluster of cottages   
 which is Little Hampden, is{The Rising
{Sun.}It needs no publicity, as many   
 patrons find their way there each day 
 for lunches and evening meals.        </content>
