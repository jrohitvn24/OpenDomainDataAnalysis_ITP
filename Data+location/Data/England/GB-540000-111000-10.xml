		<title>10CHALKPITS</title>
		<content> The steepness of the{South Downs      
{escarpment}in this area has made the  
 cutting of chalkpits both easy and    
 cheap. The chalk was{used to produce  
{cement,}though farmers also took it   
 for making tracks. Now{all the pits   
 have been{closed,}some recently,      
 others before living memory.          
 At Offham the chalk was loaded on to a
 furnicular railway and sent down to   
 barges on an arm of the River Ouse    
 specially cut for the purpose in 1790.
{Nowadays the pits are used for play,  
 mostly by children who climb, hunt    
 fossils, pick blackberries and look at
 wild flowers. Their bumpy surface also
 makes the pits good for sledging and  
 bicycle stunt riding.                 
 The chalk is very crumbly, especially 
 after rain, so people using the pits  
 have to be very careful.{Accidents}at 
 disused chalkpits are quite common.   </content>
