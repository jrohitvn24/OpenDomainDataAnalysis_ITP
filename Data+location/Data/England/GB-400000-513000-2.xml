		<content>  The landscape is mainly taken up by  
 farmland.Much of this is divided into 
 small fields of 7-10 acres average    
 size.The fields are separated by dense
 hedges of hawthorn,elderberry,holly   
 and ash,with mature trees scattered   
 among them.The hedges provide valuable
 shelter for the animals.              
  There is also much rough grazing     
 land for sheep and horses.The land    
 here is unfertilized and gorse bushes 
 are commonly seen.Cultivated fields   
 consist mainly of barley and oats.    
  Thorsgill Beck and Deepdale Beck run 
 through the area ({beck is a local    
{name for stream}) with many deciduous 
 trees along their banks.              
  Kilmond Scar,a limestone outcrop,is  
 a series of small,steep cliffs.       
  Boldron Village is the only built-up 
 area of any size.Disused quarries are 
 a common feature of the landscape.    </content>
