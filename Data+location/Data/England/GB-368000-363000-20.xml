		<content>  {Middlewich Manor}, a local landmark,
 was built for the Court family in 1830
 in the Greek style with Ionic pillars 
 and friezes, and surrounded by a ha ha
 (a sunken fence). Most of its land has
 been used for housing  _ 5.5 acres    
 remain. In 1938 it was bought by      
 the Fodens  and leased during the war 
 to a Manchester school for deaf and   
 dumb children. Ownership transferred  
 to British Alkali who used it for     
 storage and a base for Polish evacuees
 From 1955-1984 it was occupied by the 
 Willing Denton family. Now Dr. Jakina 
 is converting it to a convalescent    
 home. By 1986 it will have 40         
 centrally heated rooms, a nurse call  
 system, fire proofing and new wiring  
 but preservation orders on the marble 
 fireplaces, carved ceilings, domed    
 staircase, wood panelling and trees   
 ensure they will remain unchanged.    </content>
