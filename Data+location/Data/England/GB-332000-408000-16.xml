		<title>16LAW AND ORDER THREE MOSSES.</title>
		<content>                                       
 The rule of Law and Order is upheld by
 the village policeman based in Halsall
 village about two and a half miles    
 away. Being a scattered community in  
 the main the policeman has to use a   
 Landrover to patrol his area.  The    
 need for this kind of policing proves 
 that as a rural community the         
 inhabitants are usually pretty law    
 abiding.   There is at times some     
 vandalism, but usually a warning and  
 paying for the damage suffices.
