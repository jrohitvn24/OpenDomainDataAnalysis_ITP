		<content> Timothy Hackworth was born at         
 Wylam-on-Tyne on 22nd December 1786and
 was taught the rudiments of education 
 by the village schoolmaster. At the   
 age of 14 he was apprenticed as a     
 Smith at Wylam Colliery and on the    
 completion of his apprenticeship was  
 promoted to the position of Foremanand
 took a very prominent part in the     
 introduction of locomotives at Wylam  
 Colliery.A boyhood friend of George   
 Stephenson,who too,was born iat Wylam 
 in 1781, Hackworth was invited by     
 Stephenson to help with the           
 construction of the Darlington &amp;      
 Stockton Railway. Before the line was 
 completed,Stephenson was often        
 absent,being engaged in other         
 undertakings and the spervision of the
 work suffered in consequence. In 1875 
 Hackworth was made Engineer &amp;         
 Superintendent of the Locomotive.     </content>
