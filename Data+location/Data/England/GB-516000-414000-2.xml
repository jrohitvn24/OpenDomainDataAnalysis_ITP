		<content> Many people in{Immingham}do not have  
 a car so the{taxi}service is          
 important.The seamen from the docks   
 often need a{taxi}quickly because they
 do not want to wait for a bus.The most
 popular destinations from the Docks   
 are the shops in{Immingham,}the public
 houses in{Immingham}and the shops in  
 Grimsby.There are eight{Hackney       
{Carriage}licences in the town and     
 approximately eight{private-hire cars.
 All the{taxis}have radios in them so  
 that they can contact their base which
 is usually the owner's house.The      
 busiest time of the week is Friday    
 evening/night with people going       
 late-night shopping,Bingo,visits to   
 public houses and discos.
