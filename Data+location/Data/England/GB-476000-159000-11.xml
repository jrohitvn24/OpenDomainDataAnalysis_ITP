		<title>11An Eversley Boy</title>
		<content>    My name is{David Squires}and I am  
 nine years old. I live in a bungalow. 
 I wake up at 7.00 when my mum brings  
 me a cup of tea in bed. I have a wash 
 in our bathroom then I have my cereal.
 At 7.30 I get dressed and then my     
 sister, mum and I walk our labrador   
 dog. My sister,{Lisa,}catches the     
 coach to Yateley School at 8.20 and I 
 walk with her to my school at the same
 time. On Thursdays my mum comes in to 
 help my teacher. We are printing      
 pictures such as the church and the   
 egg farm to make a tapestry which we  
 will embroider. We have lunch at noon.
 I have a packed lunch, which might be 
 two rolls, cake and a biscuit. School 
 ends at 3.30. Tea is at about 6.00,   
 but I might have  a swim in our pool  
 first. After watching television I    
 brush my teeth before going to bed at 
 9.00.                                 </content>
