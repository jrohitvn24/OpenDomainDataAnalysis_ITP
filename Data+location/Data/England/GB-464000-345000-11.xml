  ________                             
        You play by giving everybody a 
 number and taking it in turns to kick 
 a ball against a wall.                
        If somebody kicks the ball and 
 it doesn't hit the wall,that person is
 out.It carries on until only one      
 person is left in the game.That person
 is the winner.                        
                                       
   Dobby Metal                         
  _____________                        
        This is similar to normal dobby
 except that you have a base on metal. 
        You choose someone to be       
 on,then that person chases everybody  
 except the people who are touching    
 metal eg.screws,nails,wire,bars,pipes,
 bikes and dustbins.When someone is    
 'dobbed' they are on and so on.
