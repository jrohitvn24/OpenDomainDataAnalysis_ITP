		<content> In this area many farmers have become 
 involved with growing peas and beans  
 on contract for Aylsham Growers.      
   In 1969 Aylsham District Pea Growers
 expanded to grow and harvest peas for 
 Ross Foods.Over the next few years the
 organisation grew and in              
 1984-3,800acres of peas,3,300acres of 
 dwarf beans,1,672acres of broad beans 
 and 154acres of sprouts were grown on 
 contract to this company which is now 
 called Aylsham Growers Ltd.           
 The farmers drill the peas themselves 
 and look after thecrop, then it is    
 harvested by the large viners.Farmers 
 release their men to work on the      
 viners which work 24hours a day from  
 early July to around September.The    
 company also has alarge grain storage 
 facility on the new Industrial estate 
 at Aylsham.
