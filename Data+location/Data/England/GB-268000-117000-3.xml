		<content> The Parish Church of St. James is an  
 attractive stone building with a      
 copper steeple surmounted by a wind   
 vane in the form of a cockerel.The    
 North wall dates from Saxon           
 times,while the threshold stone is    
 part of a preaching cross which would 
 have been used before the church was  
 built. There is a beautifully carved  
 rood screen and a fine painted ceiling
 in the chancel.The church is served by
 the local rector. The Methodist       
 Chapel, originally mid-nineteenth     
 century and renovated in 1904 is also 
 built of local stone, some of the     
 stone coming from Smytha Farm. This   
 church is served by a Circuit Minister
 who resides in Chulmleigh.Both        
 churches provide Sunday Schools for   
 the young people. United Church       
 Services are held at Christmas and on 
 Remembrance Day.                      </content>
