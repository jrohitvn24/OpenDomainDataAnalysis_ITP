		<title>11COMPTON BISHOP - MENDIPS</title>
		<content>    TUCKED AWAY IN A QUITE COOMBE ON   
THE SOUTH SLOPES OF MENDIP,IN THE      
ATTRACTIVE VILLAGE OF COMPTON BISHOP   
OVERLOOKED ON THE WEST BY CROOK PEAK   
AND ON THE CAST BY WAVERING DOWN A LOOP
ROAD LINKS THE VILLAGE WITH THE VALLEY 
ROAD.                                  
    DESPITE SOME MODERN DWELLINGS,THE  
VILLAGE RETAINS THE CHARACTERISTICS OF 
A VICTORIAN SETTLEMENT.THE HOUSES ARE  
MAINLY BUILT OF LIMESTONE WHICH HAS NOW
WEATHERED.                             
    THE VILLAGE STORES AND POST OFFICE 
ARE SITUATED ON THE VALLEY             
ROAD,APPROXIMATELY 1KM FROM THE CHURCH.
    THE CLIMATE IS SUCH THAT,IN THE WAR
AND THE PAST WAR PERIOD,A HOME FOR     
YOUNG PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM THE RESULTS
OF BOMBING WAS SET UP.                 
    IT IS NOW A PEACEFUL BACKWATER,A   
PLACE TO ENJOY LIVING.
