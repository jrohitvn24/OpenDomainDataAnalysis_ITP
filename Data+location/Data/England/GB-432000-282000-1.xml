		<content>{Debbie Bee aged 11}                   
{Holbrooks}is in the north west of     
{Foleshill}.Today the area is mostly   
 residential,recreational space and    
 park as well as light industry.Until  
 the Dissolution the land in{Holbrook} 
 belonged to Coventry Priory.{Holbrooks
 is most probaly named after William   
 Holbrook.A century ago{Keresley ,}    
{Exhall,Holbrooks,Radford and Whitmore}
 were little isolated villages and     
 hamlets linked to Coventry by rough   
 lanes that cut across farmlands,      
 commons and patches of moor.There was 
 a lot of wood and also a lot of moor  
 no grass only moss which was white so 
 the place was called{Whitemore.}It was
 made into a park by the monks. It was 
 waste land and woods the park was     
 known as Whitemore Grange.All that is 
 left is the history and legends of the
 park,old names,and a few farmhouses.  </content>
