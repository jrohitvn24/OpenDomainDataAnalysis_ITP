		<title>17       THE RAILWAYS</title>
		<content> The first railway was the Norwich and 
 Spalding which came from Spalding to  
 Sutton Bridge in 1862. It was a single
 track railway worked by G.N.R. Also a 
 single track railway was the Sutton   
 Bridge to King's Lynn which was       
 controlled from Lynn in 1864.The      
 Peterborough, Wisbech and Sutton      
 Railway was opened in 1866 with a     
 single track between these three      
 places. At this time my great, great  
 grandfather Edwin Pott came to be     
 Station Master at the second station  
 house which was built in 1864. Edwin  
 was Station Master for 32 years and   
 died in 1896, over 70. My Grandmother 
 had a brother called Edwin who later  
 became a railway clerk.The station was
 enlarged in 1897 and various companies
 amalgamated, eventually becoming The  
 Midland and Great Northern Joint      
 Railway.                              </content>
