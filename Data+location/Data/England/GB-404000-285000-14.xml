		<content>  Amid the noise and bustle of traffic 
along the Hagley Road stands the       
Oratory House.Father Michael is        
one of the Oratory Fathers who live    
there.His day begins at 6.00 a.m. with 
the ringing of a bell calling the      
Oratory Fathers to prayer.Father       
Michael will then say Mass before      
eating breakfast.His day is spent      
visiting local Catholic schools,the    
children's hospital and old people's   
homes offering advice and comfort,a    
friendly word and a story for the      
children.Father Michael also spends    
some of his time in the evening        
visiting people who are ill or in need 
of a chat or advice in their homes.    
Between 8 and 10 p.m.Father Michael    
is to be found in his simply furnished 
room at the Oratory House.At 10.00     
p.m.  the bell rings again,silence     
falls  and it is time for prayer.      </content>
