 A major tourist attraction of this    
 area is The Wolds Gliding Club. It

 S/SE to N/NW. There are various       
 gliders some belonging to the club and
 some private but housed at the club.  
 There is Caravan accommodattion for   
 members &amp; guests. Apart from the      
 lessons on offer there is also a      
 package holiday offer which includes  
 accommodation &amp; lessons. Two types of 
 lift-off are  used there is a light   
 aircraft for towing and there is also 
 a converted bus for winching.         
 Permission is at present being sought 
 to extend the area of caravans, so    
 that the membership can increase.
