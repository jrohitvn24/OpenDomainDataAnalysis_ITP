		<content> In May 1985 The Times Educational     
 Supplement chose Northborough School  
 as an example of good primary practice
 and wrote a feature on the school. It 
 was one of only six schools chosen    
 from the whole country. As children we
 are given a lot of personal autonomy. 
 We sometimes get the chance to go down
 to the dining room to copy up best    
 work. We are famous for the           
 presentation of our work. We have been
 invited to take part in a number of   
 exhibitions and many handwriting      
 competitions like The East of England 
 Show. We are very proud of our        
 facilities like the pond. Some of the 
 children pay 65p a day to eat school  
 dinners, which they have in the dining
 room, but most children have          
 sandwiches in their classrooms. Of 176
 children at school, only 3 regularly  
 go home for dinner.                   </content>
