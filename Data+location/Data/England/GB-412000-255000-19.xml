		<title>19TRANSPORT, HASELOR, WARKS.</title>
		<content> As there is no public transport that  
 serves Haselor we thought we should   
 like to know what type of transport   
 people used.We asked 'How many cars do
 your family own?' A * represents 01   
 family.                               
   00 cars **                          
   01 cars *******                     
   02 cars ********                    
   03 cars *                           
   04 cars *                           
 It is interesting that there are as   
 many 2-car families as there are. The 
 families that have no cars stated they
 used a bicycle or relied on relatives 
 to go anywhere.                       
 Bicycle ownership:                    
 00 bikes ****** 04 bikes ***          
 01 bikes ***    05 bikes              
 02 bikes ***    06 bikes *            
 03 bikes ***    07 bikes+1tandem *
