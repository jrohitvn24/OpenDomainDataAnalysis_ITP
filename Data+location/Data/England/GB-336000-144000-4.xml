		<content> Rhyne system comprises a framework of 
 drainage maintained by Local Drainage 
 Boards. Farmers are responsible for   
 ditches feeding into the framework.   
 The rhynes run into rivers maintained 
 by River Boards. The cost is met by a 
 levy on all owners of property.       
 Water Table is very high &amp; the whole  
 area is below sealevel.               
 Field Drainage formerly by surface    
 gripes, nowadays by below surface clay
 or polythene  pipes, the cost of which
 is assisted by Government grants.     
 Wetlands in the circumstances of      
 extreme rain the water is lifted by   
 pumping stations into the river. The  
 drainage is assisted by the excavation
 of the New Huntspill River during     
 1939-45 to provide water for the      
 Ordnance Factory at Puriton.
