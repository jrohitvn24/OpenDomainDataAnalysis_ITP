		<content> He gets up at 3:30AM and takes apples 
 to Brighton market. He buys vegetables
 and imported goods to sell in the     
 Farm Shop. Then he goes to a cafe and 
 has bacon, eggs and tea. When he gets 
 back at 7:30, has a cup of tea and a  
 snack. He empties the van and displays
 the produce in the shop to be sold by 
 his wife. Sometimes he takes a box of 
 apples to the local school where the  
 children buy them for 2p each. Then he
 goes to open the 'Pick Your Own' where
 he weighs the strawberries,raspberries
 and gooseberries people have picked.  
 He eats his sandwiches when he can. At
 7:30pm he comes back to the house and 
 helps clear up. At 8:30pm he has a    
 cooked meal, reads the 'Daily Mirror' 
 and watches T.V.(His                  
 favourite programme is news &amp; current 
 affairs.) He goes to bed at about     
 11.00.                                </content>
