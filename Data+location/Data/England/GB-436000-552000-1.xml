		<title>01Doxford Park</title>
		<content>  In this area, between two housing    
 estates, there is a public park. It   
 was originally part of the grounds of}
{Doxford House.}The house is now owned 
 by{Sunderland Polytechnic}and is used 
 as a Hall of Residence. There is a    
 stream that runs through the centre of
 the park; lawned play areas and mixed 
 woodland. We found evidence of small  
 wild animals, many different kinds of 
 birds and wild flowers such as        
 dogrose,red clover, black knapweed and
 great willowherb. Many of the local   
 children use the park all year round  
 as the gentle slopes are excellent for
 sledging in the winter.
