 In the 1930's the Post Office was     
 small. A few years later it was turned
 into a grocers. In 1981 an extension  
 was built. An Off Licence was started 
 6 years ago. The owners don't think   
 that they have much competition with  
 the other shops and think it is very  
 well situated. It is very popular and 
 gets the odd awkward customer.        
          {The Paper Shop              
 The paper shop has had its new owners 
 since the second of November 1984. It 
 used to be owned by Mr and Mrs Lynn   
 (junior). The shop started where the  
 present day St Pauls stands then, it  
 was closed down and moved to where the
 chip shop stands. Later it was moved  
 to where the it is now. The shop is   
 about 50 years opd and gets the odd   
 awkward customer. It is very popular  
 and id well situated.                 </content>
