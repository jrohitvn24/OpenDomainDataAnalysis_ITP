		<title>07        Farms.</title>
		<content> There are nine farms in our area.     
 They are quite small farms and vary in
 size from 400-2,000 acres. One of the 
 small farms Whitfield fm. is run by   
 Nicky Walkers' dad.Nicky was at our   
 school a few years ago. Most of the   
 farms in the east of our area grow    
 corn, wheat and barley and some keep  
 sheep on the higher downland (e.g.    
 Bradford Down). There are many barns  
 built a fair distance from the main   
 farmhouses to store hay and foodstuffs
 for feeding the cattle. Several new   
 barns have been recently built at     
 Giles Cross (Gascoyne New Barn).      
   The farms at Bradford Peverell keep 
 many cows as they are surrounded by   
 the watermeadows, thus the milk is    
 their main product.
