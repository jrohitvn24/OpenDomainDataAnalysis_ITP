		<title>01The Ribchester Block</title>
		<content>Ribchester is a small old village.     
There are quite a few pubs and rest-   
aurants.The shops are mainly food      
shops.We have a lot of marshy woods,the
main wood is Dewhurst Wood with a weir 
and a lovely waterfall. We have five   
churches and two schools. The amenities
we have are few, the main one being the
{Roman museum}. There are a lot of     
foot- paths and farms .There are   a   
lot of dairy farms.The museum is all   
Roman and was built in the middle of a 
Roman Fort.Most of the village is      
countryside, grazing land and houses.A 
lot of tourists come to the village    
for a day out because of the scenery   
and the Roman Baths .The river is      
slightly polluted but not as much as   
some rivers are.Most  of the buidings  
are old.
