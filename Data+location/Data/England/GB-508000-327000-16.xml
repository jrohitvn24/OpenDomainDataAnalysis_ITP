		<title>16EDUCATION IN RIPPINGALE</title>
		<content> The village still retains its{Primary 
{school}which was built in 1855.There  
 have been several improvements made to
 the building since that time.55 pupils
 aged 5-11 attend the school and there 
 is a teaching force of a Headteacher, 
 a Deputy and a part-time teacher for  
 4/10 of the week.At the age of 11,    
 children are transfered to a Bourne   
 grammar school or a secondary modern  
 school at Billingborough.{Educational 
{spending within the county is very low
 and this has resulted in the demise of
 the school meals service,&lt;primary     
 pupils eat sandwiches at mid-day>,poor
 maintenance of buildings,&lt;only the    
 most urgent repairs are approved> and 
 low provision of equipment &lt;schools   
 rely more upon P.T.A.s for funding>.  
 The county has a large number of very 
 small schools which are under constant
 threat of closure because of economy. </content>
