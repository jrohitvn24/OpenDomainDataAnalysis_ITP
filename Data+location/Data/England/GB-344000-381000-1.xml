		<content>{HISTORY}The housing estate of{SPEKE}is
 bordered on one side by the centuries 
 old tiny{Anglo-Saxon}village of{HALE, 
 which lies on the northern bank of the
 River Mersey in the County of Cheshire
 and is about ten miles from the centre
 of Liverpool.                         
   It is famous for its daffodil fields
 and is one of the best wheat growing  
 areas in the north-west, is well known
 for the smallholders who grow dahlias,
 chrysanthemums, and other flowers in  
 gardens at the back of tiny thatched  
 white-washed cottages.                
   The famous{Childe of Hale}lived not 
 far from the Church and early 18th    
 century Manor House,{HALE HALL}which  
 was the home of the Ireland and       
 Blackburne Families, and now lies in  
 ruin covered in a thick growth of ivy,
 trees and briars.
