		<title>16OUR FAMILY WEEKEND 1</title>
		<content>  On Friday we had a barbecue for my   
 brother. We had flashing lights. We   
 had 30 people coming to the barbecue. 
 On Saturday I went swimming with my   
 friends called Marie, Michelle and    
 Paul. We had swimming races. We stayed
 there for two hours. Then we returned 
 home and Michelle and I went in for   
 our only drawing competition. My mum  
 judged it and I won. Then we went to  
 the Queenborough carnival. We saw a   
 band and lots of floats. The best     
 float was where a man was in the bath.
 On Sunday night I went in my auntie's 
 jacuzzi where the bath bubbles up.
