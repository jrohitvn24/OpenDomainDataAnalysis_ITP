		<content> The block is mainly farmland-mostly   
 cereal crops but also pastural land   
 for cows and sheep.The Roman{FOSSE WAY
 cuts through in a SW-NE line.There is 
 evidence of pre-Roman occupation(round
 barrow or "tumulus").The NW sector    
 contains the remains of the{SOMERSET  
 and{DORSET LIGHT RAILWAY}("The old    
 S.&amp; D.").This was known locally as the
 "Sweet and Delightful" or "Slow and   
 Dirty" depending on its punctuality.  
 There are also the pitmounds of old   
 coal-mines in many parts of the       
 area.Some of the land is owned and    
 administered by the{Duchy of Cornwall,
 providing income for the Prince of    
 Wales.This is mostly farmland and well
 ordered buildings, although formerly  
 it drew revenue from the coal-mines   
 operating on its land.
