		<content>{Manor Mercury}is a newspaper for the  
 Manor Area produced with the help of  
 the Manor Employment Project and      
 students of Journalism at the local   
 College of Further Education.         
     It was first published about 2    
 years ago, and has appeared monthly   
 since then. The cost has varied from  
 5p to 10p and is now distributed free.
     At meetings to set up the paper in
 1983 and 1984, they had to make       
 decisions about how many to print, who
 would have Editorial control, and     
 where the money would come from to    
 start them off.                       
     Articles have appeared on, amongst
 other things: Welfare Rights, Problems
 with council housing, Support for     
 miners during the recent strike,      
 Women's rights, Vandalism, Local      
 History, Local Schools.
