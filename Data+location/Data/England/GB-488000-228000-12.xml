		<title>12Great Brickhill Church.</title>
		<content> Great Brickhill Church (Mary the      
 Virgin) was built in 1218. When it was
 built it was lopsided but it was safe 
 and stable so they did nothing about  
 it. 250 people can fit in the church  
 at the same time,and the church is    
 always packed with this many for      
 Christmas eve carol service. The      
 church has a chancel and it has one   
 step seperating it from the nave.     
 Although the floor is bigger than the 
 height of the walls the church was    
 built tall for strength and beauty.   
 The church was built tall so that the 
 tower could be used to inspect the    
 village in times of strife. All       
 the columns in the church are Normans 
 columns. The east window is the       
 biggest. The church was more important
 in the life of the village when the   
 village was ruled by the Manor than it
 is now.                               </content>
