		<content> Most houses are{owner/occupied.Tied   
{cottages}on private land still exist. 
 There are 2{private housing estates}in
 this block with plans for more houses 
 in North Petherwin.The population of  
 about 500 is a mixture of retired and 
 young families.There are few{council  
{houses,}so there is no encouragement  
 for young marrieds to remain here.    
 Properties in need of renovation      
 have been bought by people from out   
 county,on completion some sell and the
 price is often too high for local     
 people. Some farms provide{bed and    
{breakfast}for holiday makers who often
 become regular visitors.Low income    
 families are assisted to pay rates or 
 rent. Houses may have wood burning    
 stoves, bottled gas or electric       
 cookers.Water is metered and paid for 
 per 1000 gallons. The 2 villages are  
 supplied with{North Sea Gas.          </content>
