		<title>03GLENN'S DAY. AGED 10</title>
		<content>  I get up at 7.40a.m. and I get       
 dressed. I have my breakfast at       
 7.50a.m. I have a bowl of cornflakes  
 and a cup of coffee. I then take my   
 cup and dish into the kitchen where I 
 get my comb and brush my hair. I then 
 read until I go to school. On my way  
 there, I walk past Beech Street and   
 West View and soon I am at school. I  
 do English,Maths and Drawing and we   
 have four playtimes. After school I   
 walk home the same way I came. After  
 tea I get changed and play out. I come
 in at 8.15p.m. and have my supper.    
 Finally, I go to bed at 8.30p.m.
