 entrance fees to the goods yards,the  
 shop and buffet.British Rail inspect

 great source of interest in{Haworth,  
 running steam trains every weekend    
 throughout the year with an annual    
 130,000 visitors from all over the    
 world.Many of the 30 locomotives owned
 by the{Worth Valley Railway}are nearly

 Railway Children" and "Yanks" have    
 been made using the line,increasing   
 its worldwide renown.
