{  West Tilbury,Tilbury and East       
{Tilbury}are very different.           
   West Tilbury dates from 600A.D.and  
 is a quiet rural village.             
   East Tilbury itself is old but the  
 part concerned in our survey hinges   
 around the {Bata}shoe factory and much
 of the housing was provided by Bata.  
 Other people living there or in       
 adjacent Linford mainly commute to the
 nearby towns or to London.            
  Tilbury has been a{major dock}since{ 
{1881 }when her docks were built as an 
 adjunct to London docks.Before that   
 there were only marsh farms and       
 scattered cottages.Self-sufficient    
 villages are no longer required and   
 nowadays people drive to ASDA(the     
 local hypermarket on the outskirts of 
 Tilbury) to do their shopping.
