		<title>15MOUNT PLEASANT FARM</title>
		<content> Mount Pleasant Farm and Fell Farm have
 merged in to one large farm. The two  
 farms are mainly dairy farms, but     
 Mount Pleasant Farm does grow some    
 potatoes. Mount Pleasant Farm owns    
 forty acres of land. It is used for   
 grazing cattle and growing potatoes.  
 Mount Pleasant is the cattle rearing  
 part of the partnership. Fell Farm is 
 used for dairy purposes. There are    
 90-100 cows milked every day. Half of 
 the milk is bottled and delivered to  
 local areas. The other half is taken  
 by tank to the Barrow Co-op dairy. The
 farms have a lot of equipment. Some of
 it includes harrows, ploughs, a huge  
 tank for milk and 4 tractors. There   
 aren't a lot of farmworkers and the   
 family are mainly used for labour.
