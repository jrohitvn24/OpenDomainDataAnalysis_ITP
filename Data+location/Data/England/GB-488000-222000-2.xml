		<content>    Ascott Home Farm is a farm in the  
 grounds of Ascott House in Wing.Most  
 of the buildings are Victorian. Ascott
 House was originally a hunting lodge. 
  There is much woodland around the    
 farm as it was used for shooting game.
 The main trees on the farm are pine,  
 oak,lime and sycamore.                
    Around the farmhouse, many of the  
 farm buildings have been updated, such
 as the milking parlour. Also there are
 many sheds for the calves and living  
 quarters for the cattle in winter.    
    The farm is one mile away from Wing
 and is on a slope. At the bottom of it
 there is a stream. It is in the middle
 of the fields and farm buildings.     
 These include silos, cows winter      
 quarters, calving pens, waiting area, 
 milking parlour, refrigerator, fodder 
 store, calf shed, empty pens, bull    
 pen, bull shed and slurry pit.        </content>
