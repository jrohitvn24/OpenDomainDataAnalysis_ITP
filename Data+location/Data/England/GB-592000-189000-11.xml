		<title>11THE SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Our school building is ten years old  
 it will be 11 years old this year.It  
 is quite modern compared with most    
 schools. It has  four classrooms, a   
 television, music room and a library. 
 There are 4 teachers and a headmaster 
 who shares class 1 with Mrs. Riley.   
 Mrs. Jeffries is the school secretary.
 There are 106 children here at        
 present. We start school at 5 years   
 old and leave to go to King Edmund    
 School at 11.  My first teacher was   
 Miss Horner and I liked her very much.
 Our school has a swimminy pool and a  
 large field.There is a courtyard in   
 the middle of the school with a fish  
 pond and a bird table.There is also   
 water and sand in a tub for the little
 children.The youngest child in the    
 school is Claire Dean and the oldest  
 is Lisa Honeyman.
