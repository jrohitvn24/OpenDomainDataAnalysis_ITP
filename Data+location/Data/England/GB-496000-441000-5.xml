		<title>05CHERRY BURTON-4</title>
		<content> Cherry Burton has until recently had a
 very mobile population but with the   
 recession it seems to have become more
 fixed.Perhaps it is because of this   
 the comment is often heard at fund_   
 raising events "It's the same ones    
 turning up again".There are many more 
 female_dominated groups,particularly  
 outside sport(YCA,Wives,Contact Group)
 St.Michael's (now Cherry Burton)      
 fellowship was formed with the aim of 
 providing mixed entertainment.Conser- 
 vative,Labour and Liberal/SDP Party   
 groups are all active in the village, 
 but with a larger Tory following.     
 However,there is one event outside the
 Church where both young and old gather
 -the village produce show,holding its 
 43rd. show at the school this summer. 
 In conclusion,the Church is the       
 strongest organisation,guaranteeing   
 a large bank of helpers at all events.</content>
