 When I relax I like to wear a red     
 jumper that has long sleeves and goes 
 down to my waist.It has a mock zip in 
 the top left hand corner.It is made of
 velour.Underneath my jumper I wear a  
 plain blue t-shirt with pockets on    
 each side.It has buttons and is made  
 of cotton.I have got some blue jeans  
 that reach down to my ankles,and I    
 like to wear training shoes.

 Sometimes I wear my jump-suit that is 
 pink.At the top it's got three buttons
 on the left hand side that are        
 pink,and you can do it up on any      
 button.At the bottom it is pink as    
 well and it has a pocket on each      
 side.I wear white ankle socks and     
 plastic shoes.They have got a bit of a
 heel.My jump suit is made of cotton.  </content>
