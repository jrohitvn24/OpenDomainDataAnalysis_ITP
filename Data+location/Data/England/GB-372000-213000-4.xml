		<content> Our countryside has a pattern of small
 family farms, some smallholdings and  
 cottages with a bit of land attached, 
 with a preponderance of pasture, old  
 orchards with cattle grazing under the
 trees and fields used for hay, silage 
 and barley. Of the 26 juniors in the  
 school, 10 live on farms and most of  
 them play an active part in the       
 working life. In our survey of        
 resident adults' jobs, the number of  
 farmers far outweighed all other      
 categories put together and a large   
 number of "housewives" helped on their
 family farms. Very nearly all of the  
 farmers' wives in the area work       
 extensively on their holdings. There  
 are some sheep which are kept mainly  
 in fields along Walmore Hill and other
 local rises. In the dips, the cattle  
 graze under apple and plum trees. Both
 dairy and beef cattle are kept.       </content>
