		<title>04Local History _ Pencombe</title>
		<content> At Domesday Pencombe was an important 
 manor of 15 hides probably roughly    
 equivalent to the modern parish. It   
 seems likely that each hide already   
 had its own settlement of which       
 Pencombe was the most important. In   
 the 14th c. settlements were recorded 
 at Barnstone, Church House, Durstone, 
 Fishpool, Maidenhyde, Nash,           
 Sparrington, Stone and Wootton with an
 average holding of 40 acres. In 1808 a
 limited common field system was still 
 operating and the Arkwrights bought   
 the Hampton Court estate, to which    
 they were to add much of Pencombe and 
 which they did not dispose of again   
 until 1911. The village green has a   
 war memorial and an oak planted to    
 celebrate Queen Victoria's Diamond    
 Jubilee. Apart from Pencombe the rest 
 of the original hides are now 200 acre
 farms with just farmhouse &amp; buildings.</content>
