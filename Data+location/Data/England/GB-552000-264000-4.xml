 Policemen are rarely seen in the area,
 and if they do appear it is usually to
 check on a firearms or gun licence.   
 The open landscape makes strangers    
 immediately visible, and the          
 inhabitants know their neighbours well
 enough to recognise intruders.        
                                       
 Lifestyles                            
                                       
 People living here do so for their    
 livelihood or for the solitude. There 
 is no community life to speak of, and 
 the population is independently minded
 but neighbourly. People living in the 
 fen area, whilst often related to     
 adjacent village community, are       
 regarded almost as outsiders - "the   
 people in the fen".
