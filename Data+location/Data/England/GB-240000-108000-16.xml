		<title>16STONELEIGH CALF FARM</title>
		<content> This is a smallholding where our main 
 enterprise is calf dealing. We        
 buy calves from markets all over the  
 country,from Preston to Haverfordwest 
 in Wales and many from local farms.   
  We supply to clients throughout      
 England and Scotland, and export a    
 large number to France and Italy.     
 We sell approx 25,000 to 3O,000 calves
 a year.We run three lorries for the   
 transport of our calves.  We also run 
 a small pedigree herd of British      
 Belgian Blue cattle, a comparatively  
 new breed to this country. They are   
 noted for good conformation and docile
 nature.  To increase our herd quickly,
 we have been doing embryo transplants 
 on our pedigree heifer, which means   
 getting her in calf for one week and  
 then removing the fertilised eggs to  
 implant them in other cows.
