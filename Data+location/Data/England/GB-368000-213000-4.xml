		<title>04Life at Popes Hill</title>
		<content> I am writing about life in a country  
 district in 1985. I live just behind a
 pub called The Greyhound Inn by the   
 side of which is a car park but it    
 does not just have to be used by the  
 people who go to the pub. And just at 
 the bottom of our gate, there is a    
 little lane. Sometimes I walk up the  
 lane. We own a lot of land. We have   
 got sheep, pigs and bees and we used  
 to have hens. I go to Westbury-on-    
 Severn school because it is very near 
 to us. A lot of people who live on    
 Popes Hill to to the same school. Most
 of them go to school on a bus. It is  
 good fun riding your bike down the    
 lane because the lane is on a slope.  
 And by our big gate there is another  
 lane  and in the winter it is fun     
 going down on sledges. We live near a 
 few houses but they aren't terribly   
 near to us.                           </content>
