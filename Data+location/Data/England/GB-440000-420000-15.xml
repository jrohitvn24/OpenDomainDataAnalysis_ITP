		<title>15Religion in Featherstone</title>
		<content> Religion in this area is based upon   
 the Christian faith.There are no      
 mosques or synagogues so anyone of    
 these different religions has to      
 travel out of the area to practice.   
 All but one of the churches are       
 actually located in Featherstone.There
 is only one Roman Catholic Church,    
 Saint Gerard's but there is a small   
 chapel incorporated into Saint        
 Wilfrid's school.There are two Church 
 of England churches,All Saints Church 
 which is in North Featherstone and    
 St.Thomas' which is in Purston,both   
 have church schools.There is also a   
 Gospel Hall and a Methodist Church.   
 St.Thomas' and the Methodist Church   
 both have male and female uniformed   
 organisations.The only place of       
 worship not actually in Featherstone  
 is the Chapel at Streethouse.There is 
 a small convent in North Featherstone.</content>
