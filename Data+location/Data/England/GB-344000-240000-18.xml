		<content> In the northwest corner of the block, 
 near Kenchester, is the site of the   
 Roman town of Magnis, still evidenced 
 in the name of the adjoining Magna    
 Castra farm. The site was excavated   
 many years ago and the artefacts are  
 lodged in the Hereford City Museum.   
 The site is now under grass but the   
 outline of the walls is still visible.
 Roman roads crossed here, one running 
 east/west and another north to the    
 Roman town of Viriconium and south to 
 Abergavenny. Part of the course of the
 latter lies in the southwest of the   
 block.Several existing roads in the   
 block follow the lines of these Roman 
 roads.
