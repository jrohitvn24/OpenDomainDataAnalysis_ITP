		<title>11A DAY IN PRIDDY</title>
		<content> When I wake up, I can usually hear a  
 tractor at work somewhere because     
 there are 3 farms actually in the     
 village itself. Opening the window I  
 hear the birds singing and the cock   
 crowing.                              
 After breakfast, I take the dog for a 
 walk around the Top Green and pass by 
 our neighbours house where Mrs        
 Finlayson is usually making breakfast.
 On my way back, I see Mr Main, one of 
 the local farmers driving his cattle  
 up the road and into the field.       
 After everyone has gone to work or    
 school the village is peaceful. My mum
 goes to work for our landlord,Mrs     
 Garvin.                               
 After school there is not much to do  
 so after my tea, I go and see my      
 friends before going to bed.
