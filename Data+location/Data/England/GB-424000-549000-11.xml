		<title>11CHESTER-LE-STREET CINEMA</title>
		<content> After the old cinema closed a new one 
 opened in 1981,presenting many good   
 films,but the owner,Mr.J.Sample,      
 decided to close it down before       
 Christmas 1984 because it did not make
 enough profit.By 1985 rumours were    
 spreading that it was to reopen as a  
 snooker hall.In April 1985 the        
 decision was made to reopen one of the
 two cinema screens.The entry fee is   
 resonable at Â£0.75 for children and   
 Â£1.50 for adults.However,as more homes
 acquire video machines the cinema is  
 becoming less popular.By Autumn 1985 a
 snooker hall will occupy the other    
 half of the cinema as this game has in
 recent years become very popular due  
 to widespread television coverage.
