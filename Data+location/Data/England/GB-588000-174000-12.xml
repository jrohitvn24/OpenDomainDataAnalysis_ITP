		<title>12SHEERNESS-THE FIRE BRIGADE</title>
		<content>     ALTHOUGH THERE ARE ONLY THREE FIRE
 ENGINES BASED IN SHEERNESS THEY HAVE  
 SAVED MANY LIVES.THE ENGINES HOLD{400 
{GALLONS}OF WATER AND TWENTY LENGTHS OF
 HOSE.                                 
     THE FIREMEN ALWAYS HAVE THEIR     
 SPECIAL CLOTHES READY FOR AN EMERGENCY
 AND WORK EVERY DAY NONSTOP.THERE ARE  
 12 FIREMEN,SO 6 WORK EVERY 4 HOURS AND
 THEN CHANGE TO THE OTHER 6 FOR 4      
 HOURS.                                
     {THE BIGGEST FIRE IN SHEERNESS}WAS
 IN THE 1950S,WHEN THE CO-OP STORE     
 CAUGHT LIGHT.                         
      THE{FIRE STATION}IS NOT MANNED   
 DURING THE NIGHT,BUT FIREMEN ARE ON   
 CALL 24 HOURS A DAY AND ARE SUMMONED  
 TO THE STATION BY PERSONAL BLEEPER.   
 EVEN IN THE WORST WEATHER FIREMEN GET 
 THROUGH AND ONLY VERY RARELY ARE      
 DELAYED OR PREVENTED FROM ATTENDING A 
 FIRE.                                 </content>
