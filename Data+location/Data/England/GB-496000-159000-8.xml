		<content>    We go to{Beaufort Middle School    
 which is on a new housing estate      
 called Goldsworth Park.On Sundays our 
 school is used as a church.It is      
 called St.Andrews Goldsworth Park and 
 it is a Church of England school.The  
 vicar is the{Reverand Andrew Knowles  
 and he has several readers.           
                                       
    He visits many schools,including   
 ours, as part of his ministry.When he 
 moved to Goldsworth Park there was no 
 church building and he opened a church
 in our school in{May 1980.            
   It costs about Â£1,200 a year to run 
 the church.
