		<title>05TRANSPORT WEST OF DORKING</title>
		<content>   2 main routeways pass through       
 Westcott and Wotton - the{A25 -a major
{east-west route}and the{Reading to    
{Guildford railway line.}There are no  
 stations in either village and        
 therefore transport out of the area is
 by car or bus. Pupils of Sondes Place 
 and Powell Corderoy travel to school  
 by coach, paid for by parents, or on  
 foot.                                 
   In July 1985, a meeting was called  
 by the{Village Association}because of 
 mounting criticism over the local bus 
 services to Westcott. The bus services
 to Westcott were reduced from April   
 and the 773 operates only once every  
 hour from{Guildford to Brighton.}     
 Complaints expressed at the meeting:  
{"buses are infrequent/there is an     
{inadequate service to Dorking North   
{Station/buses were usually late and   
{passengers have to wait a long time." </content>
