		<title>04DAIRY FARMING IN HALTON</title>
		<content>     Mr. P. E. Odlin gets approximately
 234 litres a day from his 16 British  
 Friesian dairy cows.  Some are known  
 by a number, while others have names  
 such as Sally, Wendy, Betty, Daisy,   
 Claire, Hazel and Damsel.  The cows   
 are milked individually by modern     
 milking machines, which takes about 5 
 minutes for each cow night and        
 morning.  The milk is stored in a bulk
 tank, and a bulk tanker lorry comes   
 daily to collect the milk for the     
 Lincoln Co-op.                        
     The cows are fed on grass from the
 middle of April to the end of October,
 and indoors on hay in the winter, and 
 they also eat dairy cake while being  
 milked.  The cows have to be watched  
 for signs of milk fever just after    
 calving, and also for mastitis,       
 because then the milk can't be sold.
