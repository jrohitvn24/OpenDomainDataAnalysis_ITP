		<title>12THE RECTORY</title>
		<content>     The house was built in the early  
 nineteenth century and was called the 
 Rectory.  There is a brass plaque     
 built into the wall in one of the     
 rooms, put in at the time of building 
 - it reads - 'If thou chance for to   
 find a house to thy mind and built    
 without thy cost, Be good to the poor 
 as God gives thee shore and then my   
 labours not lost'.                    
   The water used in the house was     
 pumped from a well in the cellar by   
 means of a donkey engine, there was a 
 hand pump in the sink. The cellar is  
 divided into four areas each with its 
 original stone shelves on which the   
 wine was stored. It was kept cool by a
 drainpipe running from the roof to the
 cellar and into a well.The foundations
 of the house go down three metres and 
 the walls are 50cm thick.
