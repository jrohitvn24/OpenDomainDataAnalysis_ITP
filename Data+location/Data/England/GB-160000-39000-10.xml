		<title>10THE POLSTRONG-ST.ERTH ROAD</title>
		<content> This section of road was opened in    
 November 1984 as a diversion on the   
 main A30 trunk road.It was designed to
 improve the traffic flow to the       
 popular tourist centres of West       
 Penwith.A considerable amount of farm 
 land was lost and the effect on       
 wildlife was at first fairly          
 devestating.It was a fairly common    
 sight at first to see the squashed    
 corpses of rabbits,hedgehogs and even 
 foxes.The road varies from dual       
 carriageway to three-lane and single  
 carriageway and back again and is     
 considered by many to be somewhat     
 dangerous.The road will be fully      
 tested very soon as the tourist       
 traffic reaches its peak
