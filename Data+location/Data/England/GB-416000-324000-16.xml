		<content> The term "sport" is not fitting for   
 these sadistic pastimes.  Sport       
 implies fairness.                     
                                       
 Consider a fox, its earth filled in,  
 pursued by hounds and horsemen until  
 the wretched animal drops from        
 exhaustion, the shooting of birds and 
 rabbits - for pleasure - not all      
 killed cleanly but maimed and ignored.
 Local domestic cats may be used as    
 target practice. Fishermen damage fish
 and cause the deaths of swans through 
 careless use of lead weights.         
 Foxhunters have little regard for     
 property, damaging land, gates and    
 fences, and their hounds invade       
 gardens and savage domestic pets.     
                                       
 Those who participate in such events  
 in the name of "sport" violate moral  
 principles.                           </content>
