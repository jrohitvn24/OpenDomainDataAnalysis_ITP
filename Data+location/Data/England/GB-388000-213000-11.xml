		<title>11CHILDREN - BROCKWORTH AREA</title>
		<content>Some 11 year olds revealed that on     
average they watched 5 hours of TV a   
day;listened to 1 hour of music;read   
for half an hour whilst sport was      
played mostly at school.Homework was   
often hated as-"I usually ended up     
missing programmes on TV".             
But another boy's {hobby} was writing; 
he described our area-"I remember the  
sound of swallows migrating,screaming  
in deafening cries.Of angry drivers    
hooting in busy traffic queues.Of      
thunder rumbling.And chalk on board on 
classroom wall.I remember the feel of  
a friendly handshake.Of old yellowed   
paper and book covers.Of butterfly     
wings.I remember the smell of burning  
wood billowing up into the cool evening
air.Of the earth after an erratic storm
of wandering wind and rain.Of freshly  
cut grass and of the pungent compost   
heap".                                 </content>
