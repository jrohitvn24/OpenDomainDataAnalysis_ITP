		<title>11NEW HALL BOREHAM  1</title>
		<content> New Hall was one of 6 manors of       
 Boreham Parish granted in 1062 by     
 Harold to the Dean and Secular Canons 
 of the college he founded at Waltham. 
 In 1350 the Canons had to exchange New
 Hall for manors near to Waltham Abbey.
 It was eventually aquired by Henry    
 V111 th. from Sir Thomas Boleyn. Henry
 beautified the place and called it    
 Beaulieu, but local people continued  
 to call it New Hall, and in later     
 years New Hall once again became the  
 accepted name.Henry placed his arms   
 over the Gate House and these can be  
 seen today in The Chapel. Later       
 Elizabeth 1st. granted the house to   
 Thomas Radcliffe 3rd. Earl of Sussex. 
 New Hall was badly damaged during     
 World War 2, but restoration has been 
 skilful, and New Hall is a beautiful  
 house today.
