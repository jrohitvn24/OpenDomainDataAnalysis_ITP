		<content> Roe deer are found in the woods and   
 thickets that are found dotted around 
 the countryside.The population        
 isfairly low and increasing slowly.   
  Shooting deer is banned if you do not
 own a .303 rifle although they damage 
 young corn and other crops.Deer are   
 sometimes stalked as a sport and there
 can be a heavy fine if a killed or    
 trapped deer is found on your land .  
  Poaching deer is not common practise 
 but venison is eaten quite frequently 
 nowadays.                             
                                       
   Badgers are mainly nocturnal        
 animals,this means they come out at   
 night.A badger will attack a predetor 
 much bigger than itself to protect its
 young.A badger does not build warrens 
 but lives in pairs.The young leave the
 set and has to fend for itself at     
 twelve weeks.                         </content>
