		<title>02A Turkey Farm near Huntley</title>
		<content>    Mote Farm is a turkey farm in the  
 Huntley area and the farmhouse is old 
 for it was built in the 14th Century.A
 small part still has wattle and daub  
 walls.                                
    The farm is now owned by Mr.and    
 Mrs.House who have been in the turkey 
 business for eighteen years but they  
 have only lived at Mote Farm for eight
 years.                                
    They keep over 14,000 turkeys on   
 the farm each year.                   
    When the turkeys are about one week
 old they are kept in a large shed in a
 heat of 27 degrees C.                 
    At Christmas the need for turkeys  
 is much higher and about 10,000       
 turkeys are sold from Mote Farm.      
    1985 could be a very good year for 
 turkey farmers because there are not  
 so many turkeys around and the prices 
 are higher.                           </content>
