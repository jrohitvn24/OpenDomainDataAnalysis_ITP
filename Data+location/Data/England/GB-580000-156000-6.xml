		<title>06LARGE FARMING METHODS</title>
		<content> Mr. Hughie Bachelor is a well known   
 local character and farmer. He lives  
 at Thurnham Court, near the church. He
 took over from his father, H.D.       
 Bachelor, the running of 5000 acres of
 land stretching from the Pilgrims Way 
 to Hollingbourne and including much of
 Thurnham. He uses modern farming      
 methods requiring large machinery and 
 huge fields. For all these acres he   
 employs just 15 men on a regular      
 basis. His crops include oilseed rape 
 and peas. The 700 acres of peas yield 
 2.6 tons per acre. The peas are       
 shelled by his own machinery and are  
 intended for freezing. Local people   
 can buy peas for freezing on site. He 
 owns a number of local cottages and is
 a Parish Councillor.
