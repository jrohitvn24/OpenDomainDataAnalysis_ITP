		<title>16North Bransholme.</title>
		<content> When I first moved onto North         
 Bransholme I thought that it would be 
 a bit boring. Now that I have got used
 to it it is quite good.               
                                       
 When I am bored I can get on my bike  
 and ride around the estate or go into 
 Wawne. Sometimes I go for walks in the
 countryside.                          
                                       
 There aren't many shopping facilities 
 around here but they  reckon that some
 will be built on the waste ground by  
 next year. Surveyors were working     
 there measuring up the land last      
 month.                                
                                       
 I live near some woods, but they are  
 going to put private houses there,    
 they have already started chopping    
 down the trees.
