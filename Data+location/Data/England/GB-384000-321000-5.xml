The area is dotted with isolated farms,
most  still  working. Villages  on  the
edge  of  the  grid  such  as  Gnosall,
Haughton,  Ranton and  Derrington  have
expanded   considerably.    Some   farm
cottages within the area are  inhabited
by families whose breadwinner  commutes
daily as far afield as Manchester.  The
nearness  of the motorway  allows  such
lengthy  travel.  The  fact  that  such
wokers  are often moving  around  means
that  there are always some houses  for
sale with a regular community  turnover
in  contrast  to the stability  of  the
population  before  the war.  There  is
still  a good community spirit and  the
old-established    inhabitants     have
welcomed the newcomers.
