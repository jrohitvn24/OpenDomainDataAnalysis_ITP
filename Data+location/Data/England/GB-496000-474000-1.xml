		<title>01LAND SOUTH WEST OF SHERBURN</title>
		<content> An area of low lying fertile farmland 
 originally post glacial Lake          
 Pickering. Intensively cultivated     
 wheat, potatoes, sugar beet. Kale and 
 turnips for sheep. the land rises up  
 in gentle slope until if forms the    
 rather abrupt northern face of the    
 Yorkshire Wolds. Rolling hills with   
 only the steepest portionsd afforested
 for shelter although timber is        
 produced from both private and        
 forestry commission blocks. This      
 block is quite well wooded. The       
 plateau slopes gently on south side.  
 Cultivated fields stretch to horizon. 
 Barley for malting was once main crop 
 but wheat and oil seed rape are       
 prominent. About 7 farms. The long    
 distance walk "Wolds Way" traverses   
 northern escarpment of wolds. Quite a 
 few tumuli as once used by stone age  
 people when valleys were densley woode</content>
