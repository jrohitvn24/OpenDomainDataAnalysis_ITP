		<title>10Elton Youth Hostel</title>
		<content>  Almost in the centre of Elton stands 
 the Old Hall, built in 1668 and now   
 listed as a building of architectural 
 and historical interest. This was     
 acquired by the Youth Hostel          
 Association in 1942 and since then has
 been a Simple Grade Hostel.           
  It is one of the smallest hostels in 
 the Peak District having just 34 beds 
 in five rooms. Hostellers cook their  
 own meals in the well-equipped kitchen
 but the Warden, a woman, cooks snack  
 meals on request.                     
  Elton Y.H. has visitors from this    
 country and abroad and is regularly   
 used by School and College groups as a
 base for exploring the White Peak of  
 Derbyshire.                           
  Bed-night charges are Â£1.40 (up to   
 16), Â£1.80 (16 to 20> and Â£2.15 for   
 Seniors.
