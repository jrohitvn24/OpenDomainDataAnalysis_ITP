		<title>19The Family in Stevington</title>
		<content> There is still evidence of the        
 traditional family group.The average  
 family contains two children.Although 
 one child families are becoming       
 popular there are still some families 
 with three,four and even five         
 children.Mother often works as well as
 father although in many cases only    
 part-time.Mothers babysit for each    
 other thus enabling them to pursue    
 interests outside the home.Some men   
 have jobs which take them on long     
 journeys causing them to be away from 
 home.The grown up family often moves  
 away as there is a lack of "starter"  
 homes in the village and suitable     
 employment nearby.Thus roots are no   
 longer laid.Families come and go often
 due to employment circumstances.      
 However there still remains a handful 
 of people whose families have lived in
 Stevington for generations.           </content>
