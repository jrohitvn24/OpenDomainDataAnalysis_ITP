		<content>{Education}in the 1980s can never have 
 been more interesting for pupils and  
 teachers.  In many ways children do   
 not change - mostly eager to learn,   
 still mischievous, still very lovable.
 Recently they have appeared more con- 
 fident, finding it easy to converse on
 a wide variety of topics. Widening    
 experiences including{television and  
{computers}have helped, but some       
 children have, by the same token, lost
 out on{family games and conversation. 
 The close connection between school   
 and a caring community, continues to  
 produce useful citizens.  But the task
 becomes more difficult as standards in
 the country continue to fall. Daily we
 hear of children involved in violence,
 drug-taking and corrupt activities. My
 hope for the future is that the good  
 quality of teachers and parents in    
 Sessay will repel such invading evils.</content>
