		<title>09A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> Today my class is having language.This
 lasts until 10.40, break! At 11.00    
 we have mental arithmetic, spelling,  
 and swimming. In arithmetic we have   
 ten sums to do in our heads, this ties
 in with spelling. We have fifteen     
 words a-week to learn at home. We have
 swimming after this, the time now is  
 11.30. In swimming we practise our    
 strokes, or, as some prefer, certain  
 people stand outside the headmasters  
 office!  "Lunch now", it is 12.00 am, 
 there are ten classes for dinner, my  
 class can be first or last for dinner.
 When our dinner is eaten we go        
 outside. I have sandwiches so I spend 
 little time in the dinner hall. When  
 we go back in for lessons it is       
 1.30 pm, and time for geography and at
 the moment we are studying the        
 E.E.C.(European Economic Community) It
 is extremely boring.                  </content>
