<title>21Southend - Bank Holidays</title>
<content>

Southend is no longer a venue for thugs on Bank Holiday Mondays; family entertainment has vastly improved since the 1980's and the many resteraunts from English to Indian and all tastes in between are frequented by people of all ages. Whilst still a day tripper mecca from mostly London, there are many more covered shopping areas to choose from both in the town and a short drive away. The sea front has been facelifted over the past 5 years and we now have the University of Southend. I am quite happy to frequent the Town Centre with my wife, children and gran children at any time of the day or night on a Bank Holiday weekend. I grew up here and have no desire to move away.   &lt;br />
