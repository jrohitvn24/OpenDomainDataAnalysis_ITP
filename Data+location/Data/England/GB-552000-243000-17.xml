		<title>17Hadstock Grain Store</title>
		<content> One of the old hangars on Hadstock    
 airfield has been extended by the     
 addition of three other large         
 buildings, to provide grain storage   
 space.  There are several similar     
 stores in north-west Essex.  This one 
 is owned by Dalgety's, who buy wheat, 
 barley and rape from local farmers,   
 but they also provide storage space   
 for other customers.                  
    As well as the large storage       
 sheds, there is a smaller building    
 which houses an office, a laboratory  
 and a weighbridge.                    
    The grain is sampled and tested    
 as it arrives, and may be stored for  
 months.  A check is kept on its       
 condition while it is stored, and when
 it leaves.                            
    The grain-store has been there for 
 about twenty years.  It employs five  
 or six people.                        </content>
