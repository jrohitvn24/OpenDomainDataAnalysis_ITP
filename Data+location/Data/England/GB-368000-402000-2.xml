		<title>02DOCTOR REPORT (WALKDEN)</title>
		<content> The{doctor}at Hodge Road, Walkden is  
 Dr Sutherland, trained for 5 years in 
 Aberdeen and a doctor for 9 years.    
 He sees a total of 45 patients each   
 day, some even at weekends.  The most 
 common{illness}is a{sore throat or    
{virus. }He says that the job is most  
 frustrating when there is bad news for
 the patient but there are good times  
 as well.                              
 The{most common groups}to visit the   
 surgery are the{under 5's}and{over    
{65's.}He decided that he wanted to    
 become a doctor because it is a       
 challenge to work out what's wrong    
 with a patient.                       
 He thinks that if people stop smoking 
 and drinking and eat high fibre diets 
 they could prevent illness.  He does  
 not agree that people should pay for  
 prescriptions expecially the young or 
 very old.                             </content>
