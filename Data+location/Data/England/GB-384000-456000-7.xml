		<title>07Livestock Farming</title>
		<content>    This area favours livestock farming
 due to high rainfall and heavy soils. 
 Production from the dairy, sheep and  
 beef farms has been greatly increased 
 over the past thirty years by the use 
 of artificial fertilisers and the     
 veterinary control of diseases.       
    Dairy farms produce milk, and      
 heifer calves to rear as replacements.
 Bull calves are reared to sell to beef
 farmers. Shorthorn dairy cattle were  
 replaced by Friesians twenty to thirty
 years ago laeding to a threefold      
 increase in milk production per cow.  
    Beef cattle are fattened locally   
 and suckler cows are kept on the      
 higher farms.                         
    Masham and 'Mule' sheep are common 
 for fat lamb and wool production,     
 whilst traditional Swaledales and     
 Dalesbreds are kept on the hills to   
 provide breeding stock for sale.      </content>
