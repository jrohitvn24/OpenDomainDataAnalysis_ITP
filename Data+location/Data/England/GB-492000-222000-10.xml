		<title>10SOCIAL CENTRE AT LEIGHTON</title>
		<content>  In 1968 Bedfordshire County Council  
 opened its first purpose built Social 
 Centre for the handicapped. It is at  
 Duncombe Drive in Leighton Buzzard,   
 adjacent to Westlands residential home
 for the elderly. Many economies are   
 effected by combining the heating and 
 cooking. In 1970 it became a Day      
 Centre for elderly people although    
 young handicapped people still attend.
  During the week an average of one    
 hundred people attend the Centre each 
 day and have midday meals. Many       
 activities take place, such as the    
 Darby and Joan Club, Blind Social     
 Club, Bingo, Keep Fit classes and     
 Yoga. There are also billiards, board 
 and card games, a television room and 
 a library. A hairdresser attends three
 days a week and a chiropodist at      
 regular intervals.
