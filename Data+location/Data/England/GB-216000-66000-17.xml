		<title>17LANDSCAPE GOONZION DOWNS</title>
		<content> Goonzion (the name means dry downs) is
 a stretch of moorland in the western  
 edge of the village.Here there is a   
 bronze age barrow and evidence of     
 extensive mining. Over the surface of 
 these downs are mounds and depressions
 that mark early mine workings.Some of 
 these are ancient.Elizabethan workings
 can clearly be seen.Underground mining
 did not begin until the 1830's.All the
 deep shafts have now been backfilled  
 but the sites can clearly be          
 seen.Part of the open cast mine was   
 used by the villagers for refuse      
 disposal and generations of St Neot   
 people would dispose of their waste   
 products there.Recently the villagers 
 leveled this area and a flat grass    
 area is the result.
