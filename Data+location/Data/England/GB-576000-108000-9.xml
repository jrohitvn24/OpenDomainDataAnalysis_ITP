		<title>09Churches In St.Leonard's</title>
		<content> There are 6 churches serving the area 
 of which 4 are Anglican,1 is R.C. and 
 1 is Presbyterian.St.Luke's           
 Presbyterian Church was built by a    
 Presbyterian Scot who was a tutor to a
 family.Many social activities are     
 connected with St.Luke's.St.Leonard's 
 Parish Church is based thematically on
 the sea.An interior dado of blue-grey 
 Hornton stone topped by a wavy edge   
 represents the sea.Other nautical     
 features include the oak pulpit made  
 by the shore of the Sea of Galilee.It 
 is a replica of the prow of the boat  
 from which Jesus taught.The lectern is
 made from a ship's binnacle.In the    
 chancel's marble floor are            
 representations of the 12 types of sea
 fish to be caught locally.In the floor
 of the sanctuary are marble patterns  
 of loaves and fishes.
