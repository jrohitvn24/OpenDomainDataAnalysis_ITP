		<content>   There isn't much entertainment in   
 our area.There is sometimes the odd   
 play or two in halls and churches,and 
 sometimes school's have plays.But     
 mainly the people in the area stay and
 watch television.Some people may go   
 round friends and have their own      
 entertaining evening.Annually in our  
 area there are summer fetes,and       
 football matches that you can go and  
 watch.

 It is quite easy to get about;there   
 is a regular bus service in the area  
 and a train service,which would take  
 you to any place in the Brighton area.
 The standard charge in a taxi is      
 eighty pence,and ten pence for every  
 five-hundred yards.
