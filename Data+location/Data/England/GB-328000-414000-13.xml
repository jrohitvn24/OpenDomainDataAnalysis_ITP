		<title>13THE MILKMAN</title>
		<content> The owner of Rosebank Dairy,in        
 Ainsdale,gets up at 5AM,six days a    
 week.After a light breakfast he goes  
 out to load the vans with the various 
 crates of milk,eggs,cream etc.At 6AM  
 he is ready to leave and he waits with
 his son for the helper boys to        
 arrive.The boys work from about 6.15  
 until 7.30AM when they then get ready 
 for school.                           
 The first round ends about 8.45AM when
 they return to the dairy to unload the
 empty bottles and prepare for the     
 second round before going in to       
 breakfast.The second round lasts from 
 9.30 untill 11AM.The milk deliveries  
 are recorded into an account book.At  
 the end of the week the money is      
 totalled. Despite the pressure from   
 supermarkets there is still a future  
 for door step deliveries,to many old  
 people the milkman is a valued friend </content>
