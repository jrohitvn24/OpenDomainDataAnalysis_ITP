		<title>19Woodthorpe N.F. &amp; M. School</title>
		<content> It is the fiftieth anniversary of     
{Woodthorpe School}this year. A new    
 headteacher has joined the school this
 year, and the First and Middle School 
 have amalgamated. This was because the
 school had become very small and there
 are lots of spare rooms.The schools   
 are only about half the size they were
 8 years ago ,because the birth rate   
 went down in the 1970,s.              
     Thre are two men and six women    
 teachers in the Middle School, 10 lady
 teachers in the lower school plus a   
 secretary and two assistants.         
     Most children like doing swimming 
 best. Nearly all the children can     
 swim 25 metres before they leave the  
 school.                               
  There are 163 children in the Middle 
 Department of the school and 181 in   
 the First Department.
