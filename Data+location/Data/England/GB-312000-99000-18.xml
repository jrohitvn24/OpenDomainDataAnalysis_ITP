		<title>18THE DOMESDAY PROJECT - POEM</title>
		<content> The Domesday project is finding out   
 That means we're always out and about 
 We've found out about lots of things  
 And every visit we're questioning.    
 The people give us a sheet            
 And ask "would you like a seat?"      
 We've been round Dowell Street        
 And been to Hooks, with lots of meat, 
 We also went to Heathpark             
 Some shops were still dark            
 We drew both sides of the High Street,
 Some houses were messy but others     
      were neat,                       
 The colour of Dominoes is nice        
 But the wall hasn't a dice            
 All in all our Domesday work is nice.
