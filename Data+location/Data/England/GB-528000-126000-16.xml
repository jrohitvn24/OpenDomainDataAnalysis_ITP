		<title>16POPULATION CUCKFIELD RURAL</title>
		<content> There has been no new building and    
 therefore no increase in the popu-    
 lation for many years. All the land   
 along the east side of the road is    
 part of the Borde Hill estate owned by
 Robert Clarke and is held under agree-
 ment that it must not be sold or built
 on.Permission has been given recently 
 for one field to be used for recrea-  
 tion,but local anger was roused when  
 motor cycle racing was held there and 
 protests were made.The houses here are
 widely spaced and some,originally farm
 houses are very old,and one called    
 Taylor's Barn,occupied by Mrs. Watney 
 and her housekeeper,has changed very  
 little since it was built 400 years   
 ago.It has a well by the door and this
 is never dry as it is fed from one of 
 the many springs that come to the     
 surface here and run into the Ouse.
