		<title>03The Life of a Village Bobby</title>
		<content> My day commences at New Mills Police  
 Station. Check the Diary, noting file 
 and my own personal work folder. Has  
 anything happened on my area during   
 days off? At this point it's off to   
 Chinley on my motorcycle via Furness  
 Vale and Buxworth. Check en route     
 anything out of the ordinary-abandoned
 vehicles, road works and defects, road
 signs requiring attention.            
 On arrival at Chinley, I park my motor
 cycle at a friendly resident's house, 
 have a short chat and a coffee with   
 him before commencing patrol on foot. 
 Once onto the main road I stop to     
 speak to local residents, listen to   
 comlaints, give advice. It doesn't    
 take long to note any praise thrust   
 upon us. A meal comes, if possible,   
 between the 3rd and 5th hours, after  
 which I move on to another village.
