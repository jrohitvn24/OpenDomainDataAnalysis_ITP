 Children come to this school when they
 are 8yrs.old from Baddesley Ensor     
 First School or Grendon C.E.First     
 School.They leave to go to Atherstone 
 School when they are 12yrs.old.       
 Most children who attend this school  
 live in Baddesley,Grendon or Baxterley
 There are two school buses every      
 morning,although many children walk to
 school.About 100 children stay at     
 school for their midday meal.         
 The number of children on roll has    
 fallen in the last 10yrs.from 320 to  
 150.This has meant a large reduction  
 in teaching staff.There are now 5     
 female and 3 male teachers.Three      
 perapatetic music teachers visit the  
 school each week.                     
 We also have on the staff 1 caretaker,
 3 cleaners,3 kitchen staff and 3      
 playground supervisors,all female.    </content>
