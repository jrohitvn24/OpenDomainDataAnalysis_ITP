		<title>08The Old Rectory,Ipsley.</title>
		<content>  Part of the{Old Rectory Hotel,Ipsley,
 dates back to the 11th century and is 
 reputed to have been mentioned in the{
{Domesday Book.}It is believed that the
 hotel was once 'Ipsley Court due to   
 it's{dovcote}which only the{lord of   
{the manor}was allowed to possess.The  
 house then fell into the hands of the 
 Church for many years,being used as a{
{monastery }(the ghost of  one of the  
 monks is still believed to be in      
 residence!)and then as a{rectory.     
 During the persecution of the Roman   
 Catholics in the 16th century a{      
{priest's hole}was built.              
  The house has now been turned into a 
 hotel.There are{7 guest rooms}and most
 of the guests are{businessmen.}It     
 would appear that despite many        
 attractions within an hours drive     
 Redditch is{not popular as a tourist  
{base. }                               </content>
