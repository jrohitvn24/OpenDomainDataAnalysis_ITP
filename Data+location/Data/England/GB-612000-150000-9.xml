		<title>09The Village Primary School-1</title>
		<content>     This block is served by two rural 
 Primary schools - at Lower Hardres and
 Petham. The roll at the former school 
 was approximately 20 and the latter 63
 during the Summer Term of 1985. Recent
 economies in education expenditure has
 reduced Petham's staff from 3 full-   
 time teachers and a part-timer for 7.5
 hours per week to 2 full-time teachers
 and part-timers for 20 hours per week.
 (The Head is included as a teacher as 
 he teaches almost full-time). The     
 curriculum includes all those areas   
 expected of a primary school but with 
 an emphasis on small group work or    
 individual instruction as there can be
 between 2 &amp; 4 year age groups in a    
 particular class. Reading, English &amp;  
 Mathematics can be considered as core 
 areas of the curriculum and skills    
 here are developed in other areas of  
 work too.                             </content>
