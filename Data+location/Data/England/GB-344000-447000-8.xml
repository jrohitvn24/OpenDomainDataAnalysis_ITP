		<content>{-Governors of Winmarleigh School-}    
 The Governing Body,5 in number plus   
 the Vicar,is awaiting new articles    
 which will expand its numbers to 13.  
 Its basic function is to maintain the 
 fabric of the school and to overview  
 the admission of pupils and the kind  
 of education which they receive.      
 In practice the day to day running and
 decision making is left in the hands  
 of the Headmaster who reports to them 
 at termly meetings.                   
{-The Friends of Winmarleigh School-}  
 This parent/teacher organisation is a 
 very informal body which meets from   
 time to time on a 'needs' basis.      
 It has as its main aims the support of
 the school financially,especially for 
 the purchase of extras,and the        
 fostering of beneficial links between 
 home and school.
