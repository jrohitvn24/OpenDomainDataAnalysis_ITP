		<title>04Acocks Green Centre</title>
		<content> Acocks Green was once a small village 
but is now a suburb of south-east      
Birmingham. The Village is the main    
shopping area and there is a great     
variety of stores from which virtually 
anything can be bought.                
 Housing in the area is a mixture of   
the old and the new. The large         
Victorian houses have either been      
demolished or turned into flats and    
offices. The modern housing consists   
mainly of small two or three bedroom   
houses.                                
 In recent years Acocks Green has      
enjoyed a revival; new firms and       
stores have opened bringing new life   
and increased business to the area.    
 Its nearness to the National          
Exhibition Centre makes it a most      
convenient resting place for visitors  
to the many exhibitions held there.
