		<title>18A SHILLINGSTONE SCHOOLBOY</title>
		<content> Its a very nice life to be a          
 Shillingstone schoolboy. My favourite 
 lessons are History and Science.Our   
 classroom was built in 1975,just after
 our Headtaecher came.Our Head is      
 called Mrs.Ashcroft.She is a nice     
 person and teaches interesting        
 things.The two older classrooms which 
 are the library and the hall were     
 built in 1885. Our school field was   
 once a hay field with cows,but now its
 got footballs and boys running up and 
 down. Out of our window we can see the
 church and Hambledon Hill.Hambledon is
 a hill about 1.5 miles away. Just     
 before you get to Hambledon you see   
 the railway.The railways out of use   
 and the rails are not there, but it   
 makes a good walk.In the evening you  
 might see some wildlife. J.Edwards
