		<title>20MELANIE'S DANCING</title>
		<content>I belong to a dancing club.It is owned 
by Trisha Meenaghan and is called the  
" Trisha Meenaghan Shool Of Dancing".It
is held at the Headlands church rooms  
although their are lessons at Earls    
Barton and Daventry.I have lessons for 
grade four modern ,grade four tap and  
senior grade ballet also I go to       
limbering classes(which do not have    
grades).Trisha teaches greek and       
national but I gave that up.Every year 
we enter festivals ,the last one we    
entered was "Rugby Festival of Dance   
and Drama " which is held at Daventry  
Community Centre.I like dancing        
because it is chance to meet new people
and make new friends also I enjoy it   
and it leads to other things.
