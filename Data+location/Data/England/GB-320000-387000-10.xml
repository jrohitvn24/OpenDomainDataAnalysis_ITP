		<content>{NEWHALL FARM,}with 230 acres, has 120 
 Friesians.  These are milked twice    
 daily, supplying Express Dairies with 
 1700 litres of milk per day.  The     
 cattle graze outside for most of the  
 year, but in winter are stall-fed on  
 hay, barley and grass nuts.  There are
 six full-time workers, with extra help
 at hay-making time.                   
                                       
{MARKET GARDENS}in Meols are sited on  
 rich, drained soils.  Most of the     
 glass houses shown on the O.S. map    
 have been demolished; only 3 remain to
 bring on young plants from seed.      
 Flower growing was important from 1930
 to 1960; now only outdoor vegetables  
 are grown, eg potatoes, cabbages,     
 cauliflowers, leeks, sprouts, radishes
 and parsley.
