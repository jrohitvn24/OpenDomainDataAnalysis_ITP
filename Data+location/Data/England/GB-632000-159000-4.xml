		<content> The area between Stonar Lake and      
 Richborough Power Station is being    
 developed as an Industrial Area. Some 
 companies, such as Pfizer Ltd         
 (Pharmaceutical Chemicals), Petbows   
 Ltd (Engineers), Reinforced           
 Shuttlecocks Ltd, Haffendens Moulding 
 Co. Ltd (Rubber), Port Richborough    
 Waste Paper Ltd and Astra Pyrotechnics
 Ltd, have been here for many years.   
 Recently new companies have been      
 arriving such as Eagle Sheds, Baddely 
 Screen Printers Ltd, Regimental       
 Replicas, The Piano Hospital,         
 Audi-Volkswagen Distribution Centre,  
 Beetle Workshop and GEFCO (UK) Ltd    
 Vehicle Transporters. This industry   
 flanks the main road, but land-fill &amp; 
 soil dumping is preparing adjacent    
 areas for even more expansion for     
 industry.
