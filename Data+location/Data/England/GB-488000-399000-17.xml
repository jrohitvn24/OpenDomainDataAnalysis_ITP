		<title>17The Village of Scotton</title>
		<content> A compact village with most farms     
 within the main settlement,Scotton has
 a complex road pattern with no obvious
 main street or through road.Enclosure 
 came late (1882-84) and the roads and 
 farm lanes retain the sinuous lines of
 the Medieval landscape,as do hedges - 
 many now gone - shown on an old field 
 map.The church,at the highest point of
 the village,dates from{12C.}Bungalows 
 stand on the sites of former chapels  
 in Eastgate and Crapple Lane and of   
 the Meeting Room.This was later used  
 as the Church Hall and stood opposite 
 the{former school}in Eastgate.Manor   
 Farm,High Street and Glebe House,East-
 gate (a privately run residential home
 for the elderly) are both{Victorian.} 
 More than 60 of the 100 houses are    
 more than 25 years old.There are 2    
 Grade II listed buildings;St.Genewys  
 Church and 19C Acacia Cottage.        </content>
