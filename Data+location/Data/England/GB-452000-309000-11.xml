		<title>11OUR SCHOOL FAIR</title>
		<content> My name is Helena. I was the{Queen of 
{the fair.}The dress was very pretty,  
 it had an underskirt and a cape. On   
 Friday I had my hair curled. It felt  
 strange. At school my 2 attendants    
 held my cape.                         
 In the parade from the village centre 
 was a penny farthing bicycle. It was  
 at the front followed by decorated and
 noisy bicycles.I came next then the   
 garland dancers.                      
 At the fair there were games to play, 
 competitions with prizes, maypole     
 dancing and refreshments.             
 The money that was raised, over Â£500  
 will be used to buy things for us     
 children at school.
