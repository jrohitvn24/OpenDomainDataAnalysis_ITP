		<content> Holt Forest is a very interesting     
 place. Many different flowers grow    
 here, like the greater stitchwort,    
 bluebells, buttercups, dandelions,    
 gorse, nettles, brambles, primroses,  
 speedwell, celendine, cumfrey, dock,  
 cuckoo pint, ivy, fern, wood, anemone,
 wood sorrel, wood garlic, cow parsley,
 clover, tufted vetch and daisy. The   
 trees which grow here are silver      
 birch, yew, sycamore, hazel, beech,   
 hawthorn, willow, wild cherry and     
 privet. Also a few pink campians grow 
 by the road and in the forest.        
      The area of the forest is 2791250
 square feet and in the centre is a    
 place called The Glen, a farm which is
 owned by Mr Hiscock. Another farm     
 nearby is called Pondhead Poultry     
 Farm, and the owner, Mr Batten, has   
 lived there all his life.
