		<title>18PARENTS SOCIAL ASSOCIATION</title>
		<content> The P.S.A. is made up of parents of   
 the children in our school.  They aim 
 to provide social functions for       
 parents of the school children and    
 other people in the villages. They    
 sometimes raise money for the school  
 and buy us things like the computer.  
 They have lots of events during the   
 year. First they run a bonfire party  
 on Bonfire night with an organised    
 firework display, and things to eat,  
 like hot dogs and baked potatoes. In  
 the summer they organise an outside   
 barberque and disco with drinks and   
 beefburgers. Sometimes they have      
 dances in the village hall and one    
 time they had a 'millionaires evening'
 where they were given lots of toy     
 money and they could gamble it on     
 games. The P.S.A. provide lots of     
 entertainment in the village.
