		<title>19GROBY POOL AND QUARRY</title>
		<content>{Groby Pool}is a natural expanse of    
 water whose level has been raised at  
 some time by the building of the      
 embankment near the now derelict water
 mill. It is very rich in aquatic and  
 marsh vegetation and over the years   
 has attracted many rare birds to this 
 nature sanctuary.                     
                                       
 Groby Pool is private property but the
 public are able to use the margins    
 along the road as a quiet place to    
 watch this nature preserve.           
                                       
 The main{quarry in Groby}is just west 
 of Bradgate Farm and is now half      
 filled with water. The only mineral   
 extracted from the ground now is      
 granite.There are outcrops of this    
 greenish or purplish grey rock at     
 Swithland and at Groby in several     
 places.                               </content>
