		<content> The Lord of the Manor bequeathed some 
 land(about 30 acres) to the monks of  
 Sepulchres of Warwick.They worked this
 land until it was returned to the Lord
 of the Manor in 1546.                 
    The monks lived in what is now part
 of Church Farmhouse.The southern part 
 of the house is the original building;
 the central and northern parts were   
 added in the seventeenth century.     
    The monks constructed a pond and   
 put fish in it.Travellers would stop  
 at the place as if it were an inn.It  
 was called The Fish Stews.
