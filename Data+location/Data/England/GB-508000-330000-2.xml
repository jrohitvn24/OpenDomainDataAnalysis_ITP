   Over the last 200 years the         
 population of Pointon has varied from 
 490 max. and at the present,it is     
 around 450 and steadily declining.    
{HOUSING                               
   Most houses are owner-occupied,     
 although there are some rented Council
 houses too. Most houses are built of  
 brick, but some older ones are made of
 stone taken from the great Sempringham
 Priory after it fell into ruins.      
   Roofs shows considerable variation. 
 Many of the older houses have         
 attractive orange-tan pantiles, others
 dull dark grey slates,while the newer 
 ones have modern tiles.               
   Houses vary too. There are imposing 
 manors and farm houses, well-preserved
 Victorian, typical utilitarian        
 terraced farm labourers' cottages and 
 attractive modern bungalows.          </content>
