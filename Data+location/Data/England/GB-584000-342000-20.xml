		<title>20THE FUTURE OUTLOOK</title>
		<content> The features of Overy Staithe, the    
 Creek and the Marshes are in a period 
 of change.  Our own society moves on  
 rapidly with new development while    
 nature moves in its own mysterious    
 way.  How much does Science affect    
 Nature?  If pollution kills off the   
 marram grass then the sands move and  
 winds and waves have no opposition as 
 they strike our exposed coast.  One   
 flood will ruin valuable marsh and    
 farm land.  The local authorities work
 hard to strengthen our sea defences in
 order to preserve the marvellous      
 history and heritage of Overy Staithe 
 and Holkham.  Alas many houses are    
 sold as holiday homes and the         
 residents become fewer.  The villages 
 are in danger of becoming ghost areas 
 in winter.  Young families move away  
 in search of work.  This area needs   
 young people to settle and create jobs</content>
