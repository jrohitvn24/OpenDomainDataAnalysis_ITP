		<content> At Great Hollanden Farm,near          
 Hildenbourgh, Mr Brooks grows some    
 soft fruits such as strawberries,     
 raspberries and currants which farmers
 nearby cannot grow.These crops can    
 grow at Great Hollanden because the   
 soil is good fertile silt brought down
 by streams from the higher land 10,000
 years ago.                            
 People can visit the farm to pick     
 these fruits,it is a Pick_Your_Own    
 farm.They store the fruit in their    
 freezers at home.                     
 Mr.Brooks also sends soft fruit to    
 London,Paris and the south of France  
 when the season there has ended.      
 Wheat from the farm is sent to Tilbury
 and some is exported to Germany,Africa
 and France.
