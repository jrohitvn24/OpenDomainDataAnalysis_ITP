		<title>01Welcome to Chapel/Green.</title>
		<content> The area around{Chapeltown}and{High   
{Green}has a long and fascinating      
 history.                              
 There is a reference to{'Capeltown'}in
 a list of manors, produced during the 
 reign of Edward III. High Green was   
 traditionally a{coal mining}village,  
 whereas Chapeltown has been involved  
 in the{steel industry}since the 18th  
 century. Both industries have now     
 virtually disappeared. As a result of 
 modern housing developments both      
 villages have now merged together to  
 form a{northern suburb of the City of 
{Shefield.                             
 Chapel/Green lies about{9 miles North 
{East}of the city centre and has a     
 population of approximately{22,000.   
 The area has easy access to the M1 and
 is well covered with local transport  
 facilities.                           
                                       </content>
