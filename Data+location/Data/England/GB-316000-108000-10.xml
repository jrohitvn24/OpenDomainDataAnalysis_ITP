		<title>10SMEATHARPE VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content> The Village Hall in Smeatharpe is the 
 focal point as there is no pub etc.   
 The hall can hold 1OO people and is   
 run by a management committee. This   
 comprises representatives from local  
 organisations and parish councils.    
 The hall is used by local clubs which 
 include: a weekly Keep-Fit Club; a    
 fortnightly Whist Drive; monthly      
 Women's Institute meetings as well as 
 Hall Committee meetings.  Two pop     
 groups rehearse there several times   
 each week. The hall is also available 
 for private parties.                  
 There are several annual village high-
 lights, these being: the Fete in      
 August, Harvest Home in October (a    
 short service, auction of produce,    
 then a cider supper!); Guy Fawke Fire-
 work Display and Bonfire in November; 
 the Christmas Whist Drive and Child-  
 ren's Party in December.              </content>
