		<title>04PARK FARM</title>
		<content> In the 17th century, Park Farm was a  
 Deer Park. The land was drained about 
 100 years ago and Mr Alston's father  
 came there in 1932. It is 1100 acres, 
 one of several of that size in the    
 area.                                 
 The farm buildings are modern, but    
 interesting. The first is a concrete  
 structure which incorporates a        
 renovated 200 year old barn and was   
 built in the 1960s. It is a corn barn 
 and will be 8 feet high with corn in  
 September, bins are not used.         
 The second building (1960s) is of     
 clear span construction and used for  
 cattle. The third (1955) incorporates 
 a traditional type granary. This is   
 used to store machinery.              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
