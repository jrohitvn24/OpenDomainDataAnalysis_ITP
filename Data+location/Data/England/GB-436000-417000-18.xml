		<title>18Childrens Games in Sharlston</title>
		<content> Boys and girls in Sharlston play many 
 different games. Many games are played
 with balls, such as rugby and         
 ball-tigs. There are many rope games  
 as well, like skipping and skipping   
 rhymes. One of the most popular games 
 is "Don't Miss a Looper". The boys    
 fish in the dam and play on their BMX 
 bikes on the common. In the autumn    
 children collect nuts from the wood   
 which is next to the dam. The common  
 is very popular with the girls and    
 boys. We also play indoor games like  
 snakes and ladders and dolls. Girls   
 also play rounders and netball. Both  
 boys and girls play pegs. In this     
 three sticks are balanced together and
 have to be knocked over by throwing   
 a ball. Everyone reads books and draws
 pictures. Some children take their own
 dogs for a walk with a picnic.
