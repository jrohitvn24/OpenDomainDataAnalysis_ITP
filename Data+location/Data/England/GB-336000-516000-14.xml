		<title>14THE NATIONAL TRUST</title>
		<content> THE LARGEST LAND OWNERS IN PATTERDALE 
 AND GLENRIDDING IS THE NATIONAL TRUST.
 THIS IS A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO LIKE THE
 COUNTRYSIDE IN THE LAKE DISTRICT.  THE
 PEOPLE HAVE FORMED AN ORGANISATION,   
 AND AS WELL AS LAND THE TRUST OWNS A  
 LOT OF LAKELAND HOUSES AND FARMS. MOST
 OF THE LAKE IS OWNED BY THE NATIONAL  
 TRUST. AT OUR SCHOOL WE HAVE DONE SOME
 CONSERVATION PROJECTS FOR THE NATIONAL
 TRUST.  ONE OF THE PROJECTS WAS       
 PUTTING UP SOME BIRD BOXES AT BLOWICK 
 BAY.  ANOTHER PROJECT WAS SPLITTING UP
 WORDSWORTHS DAFFODILLS  AT GLENCOYNE. 
 THIS IS ON THE SHORE OF ULLSWATER     
 WHERE WILLIAM WORDSWORTH WAS WALKING  
 PAST ONE DAY WHEN HE SAW ALL THE      
 DAFFODILS 'FLUTTERING AND DANCING IN  
 THE BREEZE.'                          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
