		<content>{THE VIKING SHIP}                      
 One dark night,about{one hundred years
 ago,a strange ship-like shape was seen
 rowing across the misty moonlit sky.  
 When the mist cleared,they saw a      
{Viking ship}moving effortlessly high  
 abovethe{moorland}towards{Leech Pool.}
 It landed on the water and burst into 
 flames.The burning ship's mast broke  
 off and fell into the water and       
 suddenly at{twelve-midnight}it stopped
{burning}and sank into the pool.       
 Today on certain nights,when there's  
 a{full moon,}the Viking ship may be   
 seen to rise from the water through   
 the mist and burn.It is said that     
 as it burns figures can be seen       
 frantically running around on board   
 and screams are heard in the quietness
 of the night.Just after midnight      
 the flames stop flickering and the    
 ship sinks back into{Leech Pool. }    </content>
