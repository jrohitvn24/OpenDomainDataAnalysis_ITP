		<content>   As a result of a small survey, it   
 was found that there was little       
 employment in the region and so people
 have to commute to Whitby or, as many 
 do, to Teesside.                      
   Much of the employment found in the 
 immediate vicinity is agricultural or 
 agricultural related.  Other          
 employment is in the Tertiary         
 industries.                           
   Another large group in the region   
 are the fully or partially retired -  
 eight out of twenty five people       
 surveyed fell into this category.     
   With no major industry there is some
 unemployment.                         
   There is little employment for      
 younger people, so many can't return  
 to find work, even after higher       
 education.                            
   Work on Teesside includes chemicals 
 and iron and steel for ICI and BSC.   </content>
