		<content>Ramsgate rose from being a small       
fishing port to being a popular holiday
resort.Like all British resorts, the   
town has declined in popularity.People 
still come here to work as there are   
several large industrial sites around. 
Visitors still mainly come here from   
London as they have always done,but the
number of places of entertainment has  
dropped.The Royal Harbour still        
attracts many yachtsmen and the area   
beyond the harbour is being developed  
by the Sally Line.The town is easily   
accessible by road,rail,sea &amp; air. The 
education system is still based on     
selection at 11.The large shopping area
has large &amp; small shops.The climate is 
a very pleasant one,due to the southern
aspect and proximity of the Continent. 
The crime rate is low and the detection
rate is good.The new bypass road and   
harbour extension should help the town.</content>
