		<title>11A Leisure Survey.</title>
		<content>   The members of class six decided to 
 do a survey on how the people living  
 in the area spend their leisure       
 time.Each family in the school was    
 given a questionaire and 144 copies   
 were returned.                        
   We found the most popular ball games
 are football,netball,tennis and       
 cricket which are probably played by  
 children at school.Most people spend a
 lot of time swimming.The families use 
 the Leisure Centres in the nearby     
 towns of Grimsby and Cleethorpes.     
 There, they take part in roller-      
 booting,ice-skating,squash, badminton 
 and swimming.Some people use the      
 public baths,the Church Hall, playing 
 fields and private clubs.             
   Other hobbies are reading, knitting,
 fishing, walking, gardening and       
 cycling.Families visit historic       
 houses,castles,museums and cities.    </content>
