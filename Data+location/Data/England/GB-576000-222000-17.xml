		<content> MR. Butler heard us and we were kept  
 in at playtime. After play we did some
 picture's. Soon it was dinner time. We
 had lunch then play. We painted       
 pictures until home time. We left     
 school at 3.20. I went home and       
 watched tv. I had tea and went to     
 guides. We did first aid. When I came 
 home I had some supper and went to    
 bed.
