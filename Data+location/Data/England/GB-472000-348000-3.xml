		<title>03HOUSING IN ELSTON</title>
		<content> The{Darwin}family owned for many years
 much of the land around and within    
{Elston}village, as well as many of the
 cottages nearby and Elston Hall, which
 was the home of Charles Darwin's      
 grandfather, Erasmus.  However the    
 Darwins, father and only son, were    
 killed in the Second World War; the   
 estate then passed to a daughter who  
 disposed of it after the war.  The    
 land in the village was subsequently  
 sold off piecemeal for housing, a     
 development that was encouraged by the
 connection of domestic properties to  
 the mains water supply in 1951,(until 
 this date each house had its own or a 
 shared pump) followed by the          
 introduction of mains sewerage.  The  
 village has gas and electricity.  Most
 of this development within the village
 is now completed.
