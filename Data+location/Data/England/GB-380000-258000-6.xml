		<title>06FARMING NEAR HALLOW</title>
		<content> There are many{farms}in this area.Most
 of the farms grow{crops}such as grass,
 beans, barley,fodderbeat and oats in  
 fields of  approx.12 acres.The crops  
 are sold except for those used for    
 animal food such as grass to feed the 
 cattle and sheep in Winter. There are 
 many{animals}kept, bulls, cows, pigs, 
 lambs, sheep and horses. Some of these
 work on the farm others are sold      
 usually in late Winter or early       
 Spring. Most of the cows are Friesians
 kept for their milk. The farms have   
 some very expensive{equipment}e.g a   
 tractor costing Â£10,000.Other machines
 include a combine harvester,sprayer   
 and land rover.One farm was over 350  
 years old and the family had lived    
 there for 110 years. Because of their 
 age the{farmhouses}have to be regulaly
 repaired and decorated.Most farms keep
 dogs and cats as pets.                </content>
