		<content>   There is a{Sunday school}with about 
 40 children, held at the same time as 
 the general service. There are roughly
 6{weddings}and 6{christenings}a year. 
 The Rev. Richards also conducts{burial
{services,}though the graveyard is too 
 full for use now.Richard Coeur de Lion
 has a relative buried there while a   
 plaque in the church records the birth
 of{Francis Bacon}in the village.      
{  Harvest}and{Christmas}services draw 
 many more people than usual. At{Easter
 there is a{parade}around the village  
 led by a donkey and followed by a     
 crowd waving palm leaves.             
   The Rev. Richards enjoys his work.  
 He likes being involved with people   
 but the one thing he does not like is 
 having to try to force through changes
 in the church against the reluctance  
 of his parishioners. He wishes he     
 didn't have to do that.               </content>
