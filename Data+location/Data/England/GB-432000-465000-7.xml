		<content>{Radio}and{Television}reception is     
 satisfactory in the area,and although 
 the local commercial transmitter of   
 Yorkshire Television gives a poor     
 signal,the signals from the commercial
 transmitter of Tyne-Tees Television   
 and the associated BBC transmitters   
 are generally good.                   
 The great majority of houses and farms
 have{telephones},and there is a public
 callbox outside the sub-Post Office in
 Bishop Monkton.{Newspapers}are on sale
 and delivered daily on weekdays from  
 the Bishop Monkton sub-Post Office,and
 on Sunday a delivery service is       
 provided from Harrogate (about 8 miles
 distant).There is a{postal}delivery   
 every morning except Sundays and      
 Public Holidays,and in addition to the
 service provided by the Post Office   
 there are 2 post-boxes in the village,
 cleared twice daily on weekdays.      </content>
