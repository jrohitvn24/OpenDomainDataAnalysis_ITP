		<content> Most of the farms in the area are     
 rented by the Drax Estate to tenant   
 farmers. The farms are of moderate    
 size and are mainly mixed - dairy and 
 arable. The majority of the dairy     
 herds are Friesian, a breed which     
 produces a high milk yield. Milking   
 takes place in parlours, some of which
 are automated. The milk is stored in  
 refrigerated tanks and taken by bulk  
 tanker to a reception factory at      
 Milborne St.Andrew for distribution to
 cheese factories and bottling plants  
 in the South and West of England.     
 There is a large amount of meadow land
 which is used for cattle grazing.     
 Other land is used for silage, hay and
 grain crops. Silage is made in early  
 summer, followed by haymaking and the 
 harvesting of the grain - barley,     
 wheat, oats, etc. - in July and       
 August.                               </content>
