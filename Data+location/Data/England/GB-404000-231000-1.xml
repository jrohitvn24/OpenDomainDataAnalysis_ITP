		<title>01Stanway Area - A Brief Guide</title>
		<content> Set where the edge of the{Vale of}    
{Evesham}rises to meet the{Cotswold}   
{Hills,}this is very much a rural area.
 2 miles to the south lies{Winchcombe, 
{4 miles to the north lies Broadway,   
{The area is dominated by Stanway House
{and its surrounding}Estate. Running   
 north-south through the area is the   
 A46 road whilst west-east the A438    
 from Tewkesbury becomes the B4077 to  
 Stow-on-the-Wold. The villages of     
 Stanway and Didbrook}are the major    
 settlements together with{Wood Stanway
 and the New Town area of{Toddington.  
 Various farms scatter the area. Most  
 are mixed{farms,}growing mainly wheat 
 and barley and rearing sheep and cows.
 Trees are also very evident on the    
 landscape. The area sees a mixture of 
 the Vale timber-framed houses and the 
 stone buildings of the Cotswold       
 Escarpment.                           </content>
