		<title>12WHEATHAM FARM,Steep Marsh,2</title>
		<content> The Farm is better suited to cattle as
 it is clay soil and hilly.The farmer  
 and his wife are helped by one full   
 timer and one YTS boy also full time. 
 The farm revolves around the rearing  
 and milking of cattle. This involves  
 the farmer and his wife in a very long
 and tiring day. Mrs. Amesbury, the    
 farmer's wife,feels that cattle       
 rearing is not a money-making business
 and is hopeful that her farm and the  
 hangers can be turned into a tourist  
 attraction. The hangers are a haven   
 for wild life and rare flowers.She    
 would like to make her farm into a    
 centre for tourists  to come and find 
 information on the area and learn more
 about what there is to see.
