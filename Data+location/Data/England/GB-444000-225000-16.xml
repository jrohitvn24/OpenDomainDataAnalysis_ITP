		<content> The Steeple Aston school observes     
 traditions such as May Day with       
 maypole dancing and the choice of May 
 Queen and Jack of the Green.          
 Sir Francis Page was a judge whose    
 memorial is in Steeple Aston church.  
 It is said that the ghosts of a       
 hundred widows of men hanged for theft
 by order of Judge Page change into    
 owls on midsummer night and put Judge 
 Page's ghost into a beer barrel which 
 they chase round Middle Aston pond.   
 A 'folly' was designed by William Kent
 in 1740 and built in a field in this  
 area. It was designed as an           
 'eyecatcher' to be viewed from Rousham
 House.
