		<content> Several people were interviewed and   
 there is a strong belief that an old  
 railway cottage is being haunted by a 
 ghost ; also the local rectory which  
 has since been demolished, boasts of  
 having had a ghost. A poltergeist     
 still exists in a house in New        
 Houghton, objects have mysteriously   
 moved around a room according to      
 reports by the householder and she    
 believes the previous occupant,since  
 deceased, an old man is responsible   
 for these strange happenings.One      
 person was so supersticious that she  
 carried three lucky charms  - a silver
 horseshoe, a card with a fish which   
 had the word spelled Jesus and a pen  
 knife which her son gave to her. The  
 charm with the fish had been given to 
 her by an old lady who was convinced  
 that the miraculous cure of her very  
 sick husband was due to the charm.    </content>
