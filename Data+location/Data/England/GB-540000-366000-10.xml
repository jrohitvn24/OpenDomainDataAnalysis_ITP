		<title>10SPILSBY MAYDAY CELEBRATIONS</title>
		<content> Monday 6th of May was Mayday.Everyone 
 was excited.There where many floats.  
 I was one of the May Queen's          
 attendants.We wore long dresses and a 
 crown of flowers.We also rode in a    
 horse drawn cart. There were floats   
 for the Save the Children Fund and    
 Postmen Through the Ages.The floats   
 were judged to see who was the best.  
 There were majoretts.The streets were 
 crowded with people watching the      
 carnival.The carnival went round the  
 outskirts of Spilsby towncentre.When  
 we got of the floats we went round    
 Spilsby.I went with Hannah and Rebekah
 my friends.We went to the park for a  
 while.Then we went to see Prince the  
 horse.I gave him some carrots to      
 eat.After that my Dad came and took me
 home.
