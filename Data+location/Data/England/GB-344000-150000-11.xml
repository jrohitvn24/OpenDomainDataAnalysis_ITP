		<title>11THE WOODCARVER AT DRAYCOTT</title>
		<content> WE WENT TO SEE THE {DRAYCOTT          
{WOODCARVER}. THE WOOD HE USES IS      
 MOSTLY {BEECH}AND {OAK.}FIRST WE WENT 
 ROUND THE MACHINERY WHERE HE PREPARED 
 THE WOOD AND SAW SOME BEING MADE      
 SMOOTH. DUST IS DANGEROUS SO HE WEARS 
 A MINER'S FACE MASK AND EARMUFFS      
 BECAUSE OF THE NOISE. WE WENT UPSTAIRS
 TO THE SHOWROOM. HE HAD A CARVED FOUR 
 POSTER BED AND A COFFEE TABLE WITH A  
 KNIGHT CARVED INTO IT. THERE WERE     
 BUTTER PATS AND SPICE RACKS AND EGG   
 RACKS. ON THE BED AND ALL THE OTHER   
 THINGS HE PUT HIS {EMBLEM} OF A {     
{DOLPHIN}AND SOMETIMES HIS INITIALS AND
 THE DATE. HE HAS BEEN A WOODCARVER FOR
 16 YEARS AND HIS WORK GOES ALL OVER   
 THE WORLD.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
