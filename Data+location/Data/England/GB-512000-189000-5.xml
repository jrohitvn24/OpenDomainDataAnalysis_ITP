		<title>05TYPES OF HOUSING, HARROW.</title>
		<content>  A large part of Harrow is a very     
 popular residential area, being so    
 close to{London.}It also has the      
 advantage of being close to the       
{Greenbelt}for easy access to the rural
 areas.                                
                                       
  The types of housing in this part of 
 Harrow are many and varied, including 
 many spacious, desirable residences;  
 semi-detached houses; small terraced  
 houses built at the turn of the       
 century; council estates and older    
 buildings with a history.             
                                       
  Large estates were built with the    
 introduction of the{railway.}These    
 estates were often built on sites     
 once occupied by large houses with    
 their own grounds;  for example, the  
 Woodhall estate.
