		<content>   Much Hadham was a convenient        
 stopping place on the journey from    
 Cambridge to London and many Inns     
 catered for the needs of travellers   
 and their horses.                     
   One of England's oldest coaching    
 inns, second in age only to the       
 Fighting Cocks at St.Albans is Ye Olde
 Red Lion Hotel at Much Hadham. It was 
 built in about 1483 and closed in 1971
   The inn is a listed building and the
 conversion into six luxury units was  
 very carefully done to preserve many  
 interesting and unique features.The   
 stairs and the dining-room panelling  
 have been there since the inn was     
 built.An escape tunnel from the       
 Bishop's Palace to the inn comes out  
 in a winding staircase behind the     
 dining-room fireplace.It is said that 
 this building is haunted but the ghost
 is said to be a kindly being.         </content>
