		<title>12Tourism in Hebden Bridge</title>
		<content> Above Hebden Bridge is a village      
 called{Heptonstall.}It is rather small
 but there are several reasons why     
 people would go and stay there.       
 There is an{Octagonal Methodist Church
 which is unique. John and Charles     
 Wesley visited it, and it continues to
 be used as the village chapel.        
 In the{graveyard}of the Heptonstall   
 Parish Church is the ruin of the      
 previous church, built in the 12th    
 Century. Both old and new churches are
 dediated to St. Thomas a Becket. There
 are many interesting gravestones      
 including those of 'King' David       
 Hartley (hanged for coin forgery), the
 present Poet Laureate's first wife    
 Sylvia Plath, and a man who was nagged
 to death by his wife.                 
 Heptonstall Grammar School closed in  
 1889 and os now a museum. A former    
 pupil was the Earl of Stafford.       </content>
