		<content> Many of the farms in the area are     
 small and the farmers relatively poor.
 Some of the farms appear to have      
 changed little in the last fifty years
 in either buildings or equipment.     
 However one farm of 90 acres was sold 
 recently for Â£150 000 and the farmer  
 was rich for the first time in his    
 life!                                 
 The farms receive a subsidy from the  
 government based on the acreage of the
 farm and there is also an additional  
 grant per head of the stock. It seems 
 that the farmers who have moved into  
 the area recently are fairly wealthy  
 compared with the 'locals' who have   
 lived there all their lives.          
 The farmers are reluctant to sell     
 their farm cottages but tend to allow 
 them to fall into a state of          
 disrepair.                            
                                       </content>
