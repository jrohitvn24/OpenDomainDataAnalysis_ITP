		<content> The community centre in Hooley exists 
for many widely differing functions. It
consists of a main hall, library and   
cloakrooms.                            
 The hall is used for entertainments eg
bingo, discos, dancing &amp; whist drives. 
It also houses regularly meeting groups
such as the W.I., Mother 'n Toddler and
Youth Club. Residents of all ages can  
benefit from it.                       
 The library, situated to the left of  
the foyer, contains mainly novels.     
It also serves as a doctor's surgery.  
 Hooley church stands at the top of a  
hill about 160 metres above sea level. 
The regular church services are well   
attended, approximately fifty people on
average attending each service.        
 In spite of being described as quiet, 
it can be seen that Hooley has quite a 
lot of village organised activity.
