		<title>17Children's Clubs</title>
		<content>   Children in our area have a splendid
 choice of clubs to join. For the      
 energetic there is football, karate,  
 horse-riding, swimming, gymnastics,   
 badminton, judo and table-tennis. For 
 the music lovers there is ballet,     
 drama, majorettes, Morris dancing and 
 music school.                         
    Every Wednesday Louise goes to     
 music school. She plays the violin and
 she is studying for Grade 2. Every    
 musician takes part in the choir      
 practice, then they return to their   
 particular instrument.                
    The more traditional clubs include 
 Guides, Scouts and Army Cadets.       
 Rebecca belongs to the 3rd. S.W.F.    
 company of Guides. She wears a red    
 neck-tie with her blue uniform. She   
 enjoys the outdoor life offered. There
 are long hikes followed by a cook-out 
 and camps which offer many activities.</content>
