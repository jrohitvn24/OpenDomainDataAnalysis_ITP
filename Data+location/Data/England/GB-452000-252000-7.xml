		<title>07 Laboratory Glassware</title>
		<content>Bilbate Ltd are specialists in         
disposable laboratory glassware.The    
drawing of capillary tubing is their   
best thing.First a piece of glass      
tubing which is about five feet long   
is put through a heated muffle.Then    
(when properly heated)it  is drawn by a
set of rollers. By this time that      
piece  of glass(when finished and cut  
to a length of three inches) has made  
about  twelve hundred tubes.The tubes  
are cut up on a specially made board   
which has an industrial diamond fixed  
in it.      Sometimes the tubes have   
to have a coloured band put round      
them.This is    done by machine. There 
is a wheel fixed on a motor.The wheel  
has small grooves   to put the tubes   
in.There is a pen fixed a certain      
distance away from the  wheel so when  
the tubes are passed under the pen     
they are marked.                       </content>
