		<content>     Blackdown is 280m. high and is the
 second tallest hill in S.E. England.  
    The soil there is coarse sandstone 
 with chert layers. The hard chert     
 has prevented the hill from being worn
 away, but it was used by man for road 
 surfaces so Blackdown is scarred with 
 small quarries.Some sunken tracks have
 been formed through constant use as   
 cart tracks and smugglers ways.       
    The outline of Blackdown takes its 
 shape from the clay layer underneath  
 the sandstone. A spring line forms    
 here, making the clay slippery and    
 causing a landslip zone.              
    Marley Common has basically the    
 same formation as Blackdown but has   
 become more eroded over the centuries 
 and is scored by deep gullies.
