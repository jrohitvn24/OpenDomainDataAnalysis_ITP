		<content>  Danesbury Hospital is a 26 bed unit  
 for physically disabled people between
 the age of 16-65. Most of the present 
 residents are victims of the wasting  
 disease, Multiple Sclerosis.          
  The Hospital is administered by the  
 East Herts Health Authority. Patients 
 are from Herts and South Beds. It     
 currently costs approximately Â£350 per
 week to accommodate one patient.      
  Most are long stay but some beds are 
 reserved for short stay, giving relief
 to caring relatives who look after a  
 disabled person at home. All patients 
 are encouraged to live their lives as 
 fully as possible. Holidays and social
 activities are arranged by  various   
 Associations. Most patients have      
 electric wheelchairs.                 
  Danesbury House is a fine Georgian   
 mansion, standing in 9 acres of park- 
 land with splendid views.             </content>
