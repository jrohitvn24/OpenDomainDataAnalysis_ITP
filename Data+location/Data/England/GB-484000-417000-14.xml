		<title>14Our Questionnaires</title>
		<content> To give us a better idea of what life 
 is like for people in our village we  
 decided to conduct a survey.We wanted 
 to find out information such as what  
 the population actually is.We hoped to
 find out about employment ,           
 unemployment and how far people       
 travelled to work.We wanted to find   
 out about the life styles of the      
 people,how long they had lived in our 
 village and what they liked or        
 disliked about living here.To decide  
 how many sheets we needed we used the 
 Electoral Roll and had extra sheets   
 printed for newly built homes.We      
 divided our village up between the    
 members of our class and delivered the
 sheets.After about ten days we        
 returned to collect the completed     
 sheets.Some figures were lost but we  
 know we delivered between 800 and     
 850 sheets and 233 were returned.     </content>
