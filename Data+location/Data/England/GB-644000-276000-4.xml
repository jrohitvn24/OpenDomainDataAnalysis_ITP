		<title>04WHAT GIRLS DO.</title>
		<content>      In Julie and Helen's spare time  
they like to do things like climbing   
walls and then sitting up there talking
.Sometimes they go to the village      
playing field and go on the swings and 
the slide.The roundabout is broken now.
They like to practice gym doing things 
like handstands,headstands,rolls and   
cartwheels.Sometimes they fall out with
each other and then play with other    
people-even the boys.If it is very hot 
we may buy an ice-cream from the       
village shop or maybe bike down to the 
coast at Southwold and go in the sea.On
Tuesday's we go to Brownies and on     
Thursday we go to Youth Club.They are  
held in the Community Centre.On weekday
we go to school (except in the holidays
).We start at 8-45 and finish at 3-00. 
We have dinner at 12-45.Mrs Stockdale  
cooks it in the school kitchen.Mr.     
Hayes is the Headmaster.               </content>
