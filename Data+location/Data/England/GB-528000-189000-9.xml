		<content> The Northwest area is mainly          
 residential, built in the 1920s and   
 '30s, with some recent (1973)         
 developments. It is predominately     
 middle class.                         
 Main features are the{Greenfields     
{Hospital} and the{New River Stadium}. 
                                       
 The{Stadium}was built about 10 years  
 ago and cost about Â£6,000,000. 25     
 people work there and it costs        
 Â£250,000 per year to run, but only    
 takes in Â£100,000 from those who use  
 it! It is run by the local council and
 caters for children, women, schools   
 and special courses (e.g.fitness      
 training), as well as casual use.
