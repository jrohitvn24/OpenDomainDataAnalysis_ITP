		<title>14WILDLIFE AROUND MADDERTY</title>
		<content> We have lots of Wildlife in Madderty. 
 We often see rabbits and hares.There  
 are grey and red squirrels in the     
 woods. There are not so many red      
 squirrels now because the grey        
 squirrels are killing them.We see     
 quite alot of hedgehogs,many killed on
 the roads.In gardens and grassy       
 fields, moles,voles and shrews can be 
 seen.We have Roe Deers which we mostly
 see near the woods.Stoats and weasels 
 are seen crossing the road.Mice       
 usually come into peoples houses.Round
 the farmyards rats are seen.At night  
 you can sometimes see bats flying     
 about the eaves of houses or barns.We 
 ocassionally see one or two foxes.    
 A girl in our school found a polecat  
 on the road once but we have not      
 seen any more.
