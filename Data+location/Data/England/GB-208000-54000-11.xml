		<content> Although our region is{not primarily a
{tourist area,}the village of          
 Tywardreath is very much connected    
 with the coastal village of Par, so   
 summer tourists are catered for by a  
 number of private houses offering{"Bed
{and Breakfast."}In the village there  
 is also a{guest house.}               
 At{Penpillick}there is a hotel and    
 restaurant and a{Youth Hostel}at      
 Penquite.                             
 East of Tywardreath is a house called{
{Trenython}which was built by{Col.     
{Peard,}who fought in the Italian Wars 
 and whom{Garibaldi}came here to visit.
 Later the house became the{Bishop's   
{Palace}for Bishop Gott. It has also   
 been a{Convalescent Home}for          
 railwaymen and is now a{time share    
{complex} and country club.
