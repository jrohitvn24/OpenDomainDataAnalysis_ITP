		<title>08BARKISLAND AND KRUMLIN</title>
		<content>      This area is approximately 2km   
 west of Stainland. We have grouped the
 two areas together, because they      
 merge into one another. They are      
 situated on top of the hillside, and  
 there are beautiful views wherever    
 you look. It is a nice place to live  
 if you like peace and quiet.          
      It is mainly a farming area and  
 the land is used for grazing cattle   
 and silage. There are only a few      
 houses and most of these are in{      
{Barkisland.}Here there is a small     
 shop,a pub, a church and a small      
 village school.                       
      In {Krumlin}the buildings are    
 mainly farm houses. There are no      
 shops, pubs, or offices but there is a
 small mill.                           
      There is only one bus an hour    
 which goes to {Ripponden}in one       
 direction and{Halifax}in the other.   </content>
