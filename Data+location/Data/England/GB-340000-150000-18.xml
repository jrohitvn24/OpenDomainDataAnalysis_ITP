		<content> The Grand Old Duke Of York            
 The Grand old Duke Of York is a game  
 where there has to be six pairs or    
 more. The couples stand opposite each 
 other in two lines and everyone sings 
 "The Grand Old Duke Of York" The      
 couple on one end skip up the middle  
 and back again. They separate and each
 skips behind their own line. The line 
 follows behind them. At the other end 
 they make an arch and everyone passes 
 through with their partner.           
 Forty-Forty.                          
 You need more than two players for    
 this game. One person is chosen to    
 count to forty. While he is counting  
 everyone hides. The counter then      
 searches for the others. When he sees 
 one he runs back to his post and      
 shouts "Forty-Forty" and their name.  
 The first person seen becomes the new 
 catcher.                              </content>
