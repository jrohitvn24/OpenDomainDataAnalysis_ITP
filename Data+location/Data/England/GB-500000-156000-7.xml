{ }The Hall Aggregates sand or gravel  
 excavation site was founded IN 1929.  
 Two hectares of farmland are excavated
 in a year to a depth of 65 metres. The
 sand or gravel is then removed and    
 sorted into many catagories according 
 to quality etc. After about four years
 the crater left is filled with        
 building waste (rubble,plastic etc.). 
 After this the crater is filled with  
 50cms of sand and then 50cms of top   
 soil. it is then leased as farmland.  
 Before Hall Aggregates ever became    
 established on the site this area was 
 used for farmland. One crater has been
 filled with water and converted into a
 boating lake.
