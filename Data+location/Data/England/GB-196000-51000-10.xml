		<title>10The Village of High Street</title>
		<content> The village of High Street is about   
 two &amp; a half miles from St. Austell.  
 Approximately 120 people live there.  
 The main Newquay Road runs through the
 village and small cottages and        
 bungalows are clustered together on   
 either side. China Clay and Dairy     
 Farming are the main sources of work  
 for the local inhabitants. Grassed    
 over clay tips loom over the village, 
 resulting in the name "mini-Austria"  
 being applied to it. A small farm shop
 has opened there recently and there is
 a large electrical shop combined with 
 a kitchen suppliers in the village.   
 The residents share the new Village   
 Hall at Lanjeth but they have their   
 own United Methodist Chapel (1883).   
 A branch railway line runs parallel to
 High Street as part of the link from  
 Burngullow to Nanpean. It is only used
 today for Clay transport.(Avis Martin)</content>
