		<content> During a normal workin day, in an old 
 factory which had recently been       
 occupied by a new firm there was a    
 strange occurence. In a back room a   
 pile of heavy boxes had been carefully
 stacked.The workmen closed the door to
 the room and settled down to a well   
 earned lunch-break. As they were      
 eating they heard a shuffling noise   
 from the room and then a series of    
 crashes. On investigation the boxes   
 were littered about the room. There   
 was noone in the room at the time.    
 This occured three times during one   
 shift. Although the factory is still  
 used, this room is no longer in use.  
 Things have been quiet since.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
