 single employer in Redbourn.It has a  
 very large factory just by South

 that over{10%}of the children have    
 parents who work at{Brooke Bond).     
   At the factory the main job is      
 packing{tea}and{coffee}ready to be    
 sent out to their depots across the   
 country or sometimes a special order  
 straight to the shops.                
   The tea comes from many parts of the
 world including{India,China}and       
 some parts of{Africa.}It is mixed in  
 many different ways to make different 
 blends of tea.                        
   The Coffee beans are roasted at this

 packed into jars which are then       
 sealed.                               </content>
