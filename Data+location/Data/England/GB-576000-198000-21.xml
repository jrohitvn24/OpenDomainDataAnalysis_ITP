<title>21St Mary's C.of E.Aided Primary School</title>
<content>

This school was originally established in 1868  and many families from Woodham Ferrers had attended this school for several generations.&lt;br />&lt;br />Although a small village school the curriculum is diverse and included many activities in which participation is encouraged. Music is strongly encouraged by taking part in joint school choirs with Chelmsford.Swimming lessons in the summer term in the school pool.There were optional  riding lessons at a local riding school.The older children have  helped crew a Thames Barge for a week on the River Blackwater.School journeys have been to Edinburgh  from where they visited the Highlands and the Borders  . Also a visit to Centre Parcs in Nottinghamshire. These events have been shared by the two Headmistresses,two Vicars and the pupils of Rawreth C.of E. School.&lt;br />&lt;br />The children discovered that their schooling was much more varied than those in the times gone past when there was very little opportunity to go out of their village &lt;br />
