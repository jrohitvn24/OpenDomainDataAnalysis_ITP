		<content>Ladygrove is a residential home in     
Didcot, where elderly people go for a  
comfortable life.  There are two main  
buildings, the Home and the Day Centre.
There are two floors in the Home.  In  
the Home are bedrooms, bathrooms and   
plenty of lounges.  There are many     
staff to look after you.  If something 
happens, you can use a buzzer to call  
for help.  Mrs Allen is a resident at  
Ladygrove.  She tripped over a tea     
trolley and the doctor said she        
couldn't manage on her own anymore.    
Her son, who lives in nearby Harwell,  
recommended her to go to Ladygrove.    
She likes to be independent.  The staff
bathe her, but the rest she likes to do
herself.  There are 43 beds in         
Ladygrove, including one sick bed.  34 
staff work there.  Downstairs there is 
a large kitchen and dining room.  There
is also a small shop.                  </content>
