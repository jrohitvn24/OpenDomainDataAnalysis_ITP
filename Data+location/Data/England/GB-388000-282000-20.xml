		<title>20SERVICES IN STOURBRIDGE</title>
		<content> The{Water Supply}in Stourbridge is    
 somewhat unusual in that it is        
 provided from boreholes into          
 Sandstone which underlines a large    
 part of the area. The water is pumped 
 from the boreholes into the main      
 system and covered service reservoirs.
  {Gas and Electricity}are provided by 
 the Midlands Electricity Board and the
 West Midland Gas Board who have taken 
 over smaller local companies.         
   The{Telephone Exchange}on the Ring  
 Road around Stourbridge has recently  
 been converted from a manual exchange 
 to the electronic SYSTEM X.           
   Other services such as Social       
 Services, Housing and Planning ans    
 Development are administrated by      
 Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council.
