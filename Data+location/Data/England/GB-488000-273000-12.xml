		<content> There are 33 factories in the town.   
Alumasc and Weetabix are the most well 
known.Alumasc was originally a war time
government factory built circa 1941.   
They made casings for bombs.When the   
factory was no longer needed in 1944,  
Erc Lewis made a deal with a company   
called Arthur Strauss&amp; Co., to set up a
new aluminium based company. The name  
"Alumasc" comes from "ALUminium" &amp; the 
initial letters of Arthur Strauss &amp; Co.
The company began by making pots and   
pans called "Holloware".In 1951 Alumasc
started to make aluminium beer barrels 
for which it is probably best known.
