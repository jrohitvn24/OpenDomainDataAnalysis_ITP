		<content>  The Village Hall is used by a wide   
 variety of clubs and societies for    
 their meetings. It is rarely used,    
 though, for parties and dances,       
 because the noise has disturbed       
 neighbours in the past. Old people and
 young mothers are well catered for by 
 village societies. The Women's        
 Institute is popular amongst women of 
 all ages. Men are more likely to      
 attend the Gardening Club.            
  South Cerney has its own magazine,   
 called "Cerney News". This lists many 
 forthcoming meetings and has a small  
 ads section. It rarely makes reference
 to young people's activities, though. 
  For indoor sports activities, it is  
 necessary to travel to Cirencester.   
 There is a football pitch in Cerney,  
 but there are no public tennis courts.
