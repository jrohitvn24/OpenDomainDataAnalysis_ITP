		<content>Thursday 21st June 1985:               
We are not very good at getting        
up,today is no exception,Geoff usually 
rises first and leaves before the rest 
of us. He knows better than to expect  
too much of me in the morning-so do the
boys. They still need chasing in the   
morning but know better to try my      
patience before I've had my coffee.    
At 8.45 there's just time to  put the  
washing machine on before we pile into 
the car for the short trip (grey skies 
- might rain) to school. This provides 
the first opportunity for socialising, 
twenty minutes gossip outside the      
school gates.                          
Thursday is supermarket day,two hours  
of battling with the shopping trolley  
to stock up the larder and freezer for 
the week.Time to collect David,he has  
spent the morning at school-getting a  
feel for it.Over lunch we talk over..  </content>
