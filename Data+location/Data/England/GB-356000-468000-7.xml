		<content>Hornby Primary School serves the area  
under study and provides education for 
pupils between five and eleven.The     
school has 74 pupils on roll and they  
belong to one of three classes within  
the school. There is an Infant class, a
Lower Junior class and an Upper Junior 
class staffed by one part-time and     
three full time teachers. The pupils   
enjoy a full and varied curriculum and 
many take part in after school         
activities. The present school building
has been occupied for 22 years.        
Hornby County Secondary is one of the  
smallest in the country, having some   
140 pupils on roll. The pupils are     
drawn from a wide rural area, often    
coming from very small primary schools.
The curriculum is not as extensive as  
larger schools: several part time      
teachers are employed to provide more  
choice for GCE and CSE exams.          </content>
