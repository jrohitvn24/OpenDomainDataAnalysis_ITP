		<title>12DRAMA IN WOOKEY HOLE CAVES</title>
		<content>   AS I WALKED UP THE PATH, THE CAVES  
 SEEMED TO BE BECKONING ME IN.I OPENED 
 THE DOOR,I  CREPT IN CAUTIOUSLY,TRYING
 NOT TO DISTURB THE BATS WHICH DANGLED 
 HIGH ABOVE ON THE ROCK FACE.          
                                       
   LIGHT SHOWED UP WATER SEEPING OUT OF
 THE LIMESTONE WALLS, THEN SOMETHING   
 FELL ON ME, I JUMPED,BUT IT WAS ONLY A
 DROP OF WATER WHOSE SOUND ECHOED      
 AROUND THE CHAMBER.                   
                                       
  MY HEART BEAT FASTER, WAS SOMEONE    
 WATCHING ME? THEN I SAW THE WITCH,SHE 
 SEEMED TO MOVE, BUT ALL WAS STILL,    
 EXCEPT FOR THE ROWING BOAT FLOATING   
 LIKE A FEATHER ON THE RIVER AXE,      
 LONELY AND WAITING. THEN THERE WAS A  
 SOUND, FOOTSTEPS WERE FOLLOWING ME,   
 NOT HUMAN....I RAN TO THE ENTRANCE,   
 BREATHLESS,A LONELY LOST DOG          
 THANKFULLY ARRIVED AT THE SAME TIME!. </content>
