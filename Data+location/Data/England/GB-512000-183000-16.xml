		<title>16WHAT DISAPPEARS IN NORTHOLT?</title>
		<content>{Northolt Park Station}was built as a  
 halt for Northolt Race Course.  The   
 racecourse has now become a housing   
 estate but the station is a convenient
 way of getting into Central London for
 South Harrow and Northolt commuters.  
{The booking clerk}at Northolt Park has
 been there for five years.  Before    
 that he worked as a signalman.  He has
 to take care of the station as well as
 selling tickets.  Although his work   
 requires training, he insists that an 
 important part of his work depends on 
 dealing well with people.  The booking
 clerk has to be at the station at 6.30
 a.m.                                  
{The train driver}has a much longer    
 training.  When he began his work     
 there used to be steam trains on this 
 line.  Now all the locomotives are    
 diesel and are a lot faster.
