		<content> There are few buses in the area, and  
 no railway since the railway from     
 Worcester to Leominster closed down   
 over twenty years ago.  There is a bus
 service five days a week which runs   
 along the road from Bromyard to       
 Bishops Frome and Hereford, passing   
 through Munderfield village. This     
 takes school children and workers in  
 the mornings and brings them back in  
 the early evenings.  On Saturday a bus
 goes through the south east corner of 
 the block running from Bishops Frome  
 to Worcester.  Most families have cars
 as it is very difficult to live in the
 country without some form of personal 
 transport.  A few people cycle, but   
 with so much heavy traffic around this
 can be dangerous. The large lorries   
 particularly the articulated ones make
 the minor roads unpleasant for other  
 users and break up the road surfaces. </content>
