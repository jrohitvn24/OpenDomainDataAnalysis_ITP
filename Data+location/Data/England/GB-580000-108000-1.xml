		<title>01HASTINGS IN 1985</title>
		<content>   The town has a population of 75 000 
 in 1985.  Hastings has a long history 
 but grew rapidly after the railway led
 to the development of tourism.        
    Today tourism is still important   
 but the economy is diversified.  Many 
 people have retired to the area.  New 
 industries have been established      
 providing employment for the younger  
 people of the town.  Some people      
 travel to London to work each day.    
  Unemployment is higher than other    
 places in the South East. However many
 young people still leave the town to  
 look for work.
