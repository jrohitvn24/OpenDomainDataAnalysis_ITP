{ The Great Central Railway}opened in  
 1899.It became part of the{London     
{North Eastern Railway}in the 1923     
 Grouping.                             
  It closed,south of Rugby,in 1966,    
 after the 1962 Beeching Report.The    
 final section,from Rugby to Nottingham
 closed in 1969.                       
  The line is now owned by the Rugby   
 Borough Council and various farmers.  
 The area includes a leisure walk and  
 farmland.                             
  Railway evidence today includes :-   
 earthworks (cuttings and embankments);
 ballast stones;bases of plate layers' 
 huts;support wires from telegraph     
 poles and signals,in the embankments. 
 There are also bridges,both intact    
 and with their tops removed.          
  Nature now reduces the original      
 double track width to one.            </content>
