		<content> This area is covered by the Police    
 Station at Newark from which all      
 police services come. The local       
 Policeman lives in Bilsthorpe with his
 wife and 4 children who attend the    
 local school. He and 2 other local    
 policeman cover Bilsthorpe, Eakring,  
 Kirklington, Farnsfield, Edingley,    
 Halam and Rufford. Bilsthorpe of this 
 area causes more problems than the    
 others. Vandalism of the Telephone    
 Boxes and the Village War-memorial    
 Clock being regular occurences.       
 However the main problems for the     
 local police are caused by the traffic
 accidents of the trunk roads A614 and 
 A617.
