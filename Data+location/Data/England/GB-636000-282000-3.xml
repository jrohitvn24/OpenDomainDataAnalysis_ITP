    Old Forge Print is on the main A144
Bungay to Halesworth road. Mr. Luck    
bought the premises in 1979 when it was
a craft shop called  "Pot Luck". He    
changed the name to  "Old Forge        
Pottery" and began to make small pieces
of pottery i.e. cups and saucers,vases,
pots etc. These were mostly orders for 
small firms around the area.           
    Recently this year Mr. Luck has    
decided to change from pottery to      
printing and therefore, Old Forge Print
was formed in June 1985.He has various 
printing machinery, some old and some  
newer models and is hoping to start    
with small printing jobs i.e. letter   
headings, cards etc.
