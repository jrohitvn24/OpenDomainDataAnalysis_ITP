		<content> In 1976 the{community library}was     
 built.It opened a year after in       
 1977.The{community centre}was opened  
 at the same time.The{community centre}
 and the library come under the same   
 heading.In the library there is a     
 rough estimate of 5,000 books.The     
 most popular books for adults are by  
 Catherine Cookson and for children    
 they are by Enid Blyton.The library is
 built on the old school playground    
 because the{community}centre used to  
 be the village school.Another estimate
 shows 1,740 members in the Blackmore  
 library.About 500 books are taken out 
 a week.The library has more adults    
 members than children.The{information 
{system}also has tapes for blind       
 people,music and language tapes.The   
 library is also an information service
 with exhibitions and presently there  
 is one of old photographs of Blackmore</content>
