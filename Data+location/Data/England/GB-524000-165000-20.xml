		<content>  The work that has been undertaken on 
 this square has involved a number of  
 schools in two different education    
 authorities-London Boroughs of Merton 
 and Sutton.  The age ranges of the    
 pupils involved was from five to      
 sixteen and covered all abilities.    
 The schools involved were; Cheam Park 
 Farm Primary School, Tweeddale Primary
 School, St.Catherine's Middle School  
 and Gaynesford, Greenshaw, Willows and
 Garth High Schools. The work was      
 undertaken in June and July 1985 in   
 preparation for Domesday 1986. The    
 information from all the schools was  
 put onto the computer at Garth High   
 School.
