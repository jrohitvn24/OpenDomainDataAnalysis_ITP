		<title>06BRADWELL PARISH COUNCIL</title>
		<content>   One of the main discussions at the  
 moment is about the building of a link
 road between{Bradwell}and the new     
{Gt. Yarmouth}by_pass. There are plans 
 for a buffer zone to be built between 
 Gapton Hall industrial estate and a   
 new estate of private houses. This    
 would be a high mound with trees on   
 the top. The new link road would be   
 built through this buffer zone. The   
 parish council are opposed to this    
 plan as residents would be disturbed. 
   The{Gt. Yarmouth}by_pass will       
 provide more debate in the future as  
 an extension is planned to the new    
 road. Two routes have been proposed.  
 One uses the old railway line through 
{Gorleston}and the other is a longer   
 route around{Bradwell.                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
