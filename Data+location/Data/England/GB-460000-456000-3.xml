		<title>03SHOPPING IN HAXBY IN 1935</title>
		<content>                                       
  I interviewed two ladies from the    
 Luncheon Club at the Methodist Chapel 
 who shopped in Haxby in 1935.         
  They said that the newsagents was    
 called Bullyvans then but there has   
 been a newsagents on that site for a  
 hundred years.The only other shop     
 which has stayed the same is Ellerkers
 the grocers.                          
  Where the travel agents is now Mrs.  
 Jefferson used to sell flour and      
 chicken food.                         
 The tea shop used to be a rating      
 office and later a pork shop.         
 Wright's Freezer shop used to be the  
 village Post Office.                  
 Travelling salesmen sold bread and    
 vegetables.                           
 The nearest market was in York every  
 Saturday.                             
                                       </content>
