		<title>12PARISH MEETING W.ST.LAWRENCE</title>
		<content> Wick St. Lawrence with a total popul_ 
 ation of two hundred is the only      
 parish in the District  of Woodspring 
 that is not large enough to have a    
 Parish Council.Instead it has a Parish
 Meeting which is called whenever      
 there is a planning application or any
 other matter of public concern to be  
 discussed.This is an open meeting for 
 all electors.A meeting is usually     
 called for twice a year.As a result of
 there being no Parish Council the     
 parish does not raise a rate for local
 spending.                             
 The interests of the village are      
 represented on Woodspring District    
 Council by two councillors and on the 
 County Council by one member.District 
 and County Councillors serve for three
 years, but it is also arranged that   
 they do not become due for re_election
 at the same time.                     </content>
