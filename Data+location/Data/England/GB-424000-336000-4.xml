		<title>04PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content> The Parish of Christ Church, Long Lane
 extends over 3000 acres taken in 1859 
 from the adjacent Parishes of Trusley,
 Sutton-on-the-Hill and Brailsford; the
 Parish Church was built in the same   
 year, the Tower and Vestry being added
 in 1874. The Parish Priest lives in   
 Long Lane, but has charge also of the 
 Parishes of Dalbury, Longford and     
 Radbourne.  In what is an entirely    
 rural area, much of the Parish        
 Priest's time is taken up with the    
 day-to-day needs of the four Parishes,
 in necessary visiting and pastoral    
 care.  The Sunday services are shared 
 amongst the Churches by common        
 consent, the time and form of the     
 services varying week by week.  The   
 Parish Priest depends heavily on the  
 strong support and goodwill of        
 parishioners.Opposite the church is an
 obsolete Methodist Chapel built 1858. </content>
