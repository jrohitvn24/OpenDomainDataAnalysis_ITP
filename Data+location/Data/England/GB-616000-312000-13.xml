		<title>13FARMS AND FARMING,DRAYTON</title>
		<content>    Most of the farms in this area are 
 predominantly{arable,}growing wheat   
 and barley,peas and oilseed rape,as   
 well as a great deal of{sugar beet.   
 This is sugar beet country,and during 
 the beet harvest the roads are busy   
 with huge lorries taking the beet from
 roadside clamps to the processing     
 factories.                            
   {Dairy farming}has all but          
 disappeared recently from the area,due
 mainly to the imposition of{milk      
{quotas}by the{E.E.C.                  
    There is some{beef farming}on land 
 near the river unsuitable for         
 cultivation, and the nearby{turkey    
 farms and processing plant of the     
{Bernard Matthews}company are made     
 evident by the large number of lorries
 which come through the area on their  
 way to or from Norwich.
