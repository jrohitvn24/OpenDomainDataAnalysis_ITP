		<title>10HOW ASKERN HAS CHANGED</title>
		<content> Askern has changed a great deal over  
 the years. Before the pit was built it
 was a beautiful spa town but now it is
 an industrial village. I asked a local
 resident about the changes she had    
 seen in the town.                     
{       Mavis Sayer}is{51 years old}and
 has lived in Askern for{24 years.}She 
 is a schoolteacher. She said the main 
 changes had been the building of the{ 
{BMX track}and the{library}and the     
 change of{Moss Road Junior School}to a
{first school.}She thought that Askern 
 was a better place now because of the 
 industry, but she liked it better     
 before all the changes. She said that 
 the lake was a beautiful part of the  
 village.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
