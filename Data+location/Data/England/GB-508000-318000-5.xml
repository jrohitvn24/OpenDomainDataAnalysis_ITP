		<title>05RED HALL, BOURNE</title>
		<content> A place of{local historical}interest  
 is{The Red Hall.}It was built in the  
 16th.century by Gilbert Fisher. In the
 dining room it has oak panels. Round  
 the bottom half of the room the seats 
 are velvet. In the 18th century {The  
{Red Hall}passed to the Digby family of
 North Luffenham. The Hall remained    
 with the family until it was sold to  
 Bourne and Essendine Railway Company. 
 Twelve years later the railway company
 decided to destroy the hall.          
 Fortunately, there were enough people 
 to organize a campaign to keep it     
 open.                                 
 Today, {The Red Hall}is used for      
 parties and special occasions. It is  
 open to the public every morning      
 except on Sundays.
