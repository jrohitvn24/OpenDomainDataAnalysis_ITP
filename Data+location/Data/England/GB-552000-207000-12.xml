		<title>12COMING TO SCHOOL IN MORETON</title>
		<content> I live in Ongar, but I come to school 
 in Moreton because I use to live      
 here.                                 
 I like coming to school in Moreton    
 because on the way I can smell 2 miles
 of corn, barley and rape. On the way I
 see cows and sheep grazing in the     
 meadow. Sometimes I see horses running
 in the fields. As we drive down the   
 road from Ongar I notice that the     
 roads are getting narrower because we 
 are getting near the village.         
 There are not so many houses in       
 Moreton as there are in Ongar. Moreton
 is very colourful, but Ongar has not  
 got so many fields so it is not so    
 colourful.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
