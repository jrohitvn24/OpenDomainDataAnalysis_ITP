		<title>19Clive Hall Farm</title>
		<content> Clive Farm has 225 acres of land with 
 the farm buildings being over 200     
 years old.   The present owners have  
 lived at the farm for 40 years and now
 have 90 milking cows, 15 chickens, 10 
 beef cattle, and 30 heifers.  20 acres
 are used for wheat, 65 for barley, and
 60 are rough grazing. Crops are sold  
 at Shrewsbury market.  The farm       
 workers rise at 7am and finish work   
 usually at 6pm depending on the       
 season. The farm owns tractors, a     
 combine harvester, silage trucks,     
 harrows, balers and cultivators.  The 
 farm does not exhibit any of its      
 animals at shows as the farmer        
 considers they are not good enough. 2 
 other people are employed on the farm 
 as well at the owner.  The farmer     
 enjoys most harvesting the crops and  
 most dislikes cleaning out the septic 
 tank.                                 </content>
