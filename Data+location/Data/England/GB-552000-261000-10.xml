		<title>10THE MILL,COMMERCIAL END</title>
		<content> At the bottom of Mill Lane down       
 Commercial End there is a mill. It has
 now stopped working. It has been there
 for many years and has provided lots  
 of jobs for villagers.There have been 
 talks of knocking it down and building
 houses.Lots of people don't want this 
 to happen.Many people down Mill Lane  
 think it is a good idea because it    
 blocks out the sun.There has been a   
 list of names to see who doesn't want 
 it knocked down and it has been sent  
 off to a person who wants to know     
 about it.I think that it has been     
 decided that it will be demolished but
 I and many other people hope not.
