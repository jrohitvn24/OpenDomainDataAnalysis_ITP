		<content> The project was done by pupils from   
 the third form of Repton School and by
 senior classes from the village school
 at Repton.                            
 The land-cover and amenity surveys    
 were done by Geography groups on two  
 days during the month of July 1985.   
 The text was collected by History     
 classes from Repton School and Repton 
 Primary school. It was then edited by 
 some Repton School Lower Sixth formers
 studying English.
