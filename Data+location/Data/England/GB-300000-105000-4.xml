		<content>   First recorded vicar was Sir William
 Chartulary in 1181.The present        
 vicar,Rev.Mapson,lives in a new       
 vicarage,the old vicarage,built in    
 1820,is now an old people's home.     
   Present parish church was started in
 1450,taking 100 years to              
 finish.Beautiful Lane's chapel,built  
 with money from local clothier,was    
 started in 1526. It now costs         
 c.Â£20 000 a year to keep St.Andrews in
 good repair,the upkeep of the tower   
 and carvings taking most money.As well
 as church services,a mother and       
 toddler group and youth club are      
 organised.Mr.Mapson enjoys his job but
 worries about the future.He fears     
 growth of lack of concern for others  
 and perhaps Christianity becoming an  
 underground organisation.
