		<content>  The school was built in 1871. In 1960
 a kitchen and toilets were built on,  
 and in 1973 the infants classroom was 
 erected in the playground. In 1982 oil
 fired central heating  was installed. 
 There are 3 classrooms, a dining room,
 a kitchen, toilets, playgrounds and a 
 playing field. The 45 children aged   
 from 5 to 11 are divided into 2       
 classes, 24 in the infant class and 21
 in the junior class. The school is    
 situated near the church. There are   
 2.1 teachers, 1 ancillary helper, 1   
 cleaner _in_ charge,1 cook and a      
 kitchen assistant. Each year we have a
 school outing to different places of  
 interest and a school fete to raise   
 money. We have a Hallowe'en Party, but
 we used to have a bonfire in a field  
 across the road. Twice a week the     
 Rector takes assembly and gives       
 religious education.                  </content>
