		<title>07PIVINGTON MILL IND. UNITS</title>
		<content> Pivington Mill was a working mill     
 during the second world war making    
 webbing belts and straps for military 
 uniforms.                             
  The original buildings have now      
 been converted into small industrial  
 units which produce a wide variety of 
 goods. These range from a small three 
 man industry making garden furniture  
 to an engineering works employing     
 thirty people. The most recent        
 addition to the site is a family run  
 coach and mini-bus hire firm.         
  The site originally housed the Manor 
 of Pevington, which was held at the   
 time of the original Domesday by Ralph
 de Curbespine on behalf of Odo, Bishop
 of Bayeux. Pevington Manor and its    
 church of St. Mary's were passed into 
 the Dering family of Surrenden and    
 administered by them.
