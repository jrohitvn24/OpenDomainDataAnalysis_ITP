		<content> One of the annual customs was selling 
 hot cross buns on Good Friday between 
 4 &amp; 5 a.m. Men would tour around the  
 town selling hot cross buns.          
  May 1st. was a great day for kids.   
 The girls received new dolls and then 
 took them round to friends for them   
 to be admired.The boys would make     
 crosses and then have a competion to  
 see who could decorate it the best    
 with moss,lichen and flowers.The      
 older children celebrated             
 differently.They got up early in the  
 morning and went out to collect       
 primroses.When they had collected a   
 lot they went to the church.While the 
 adults packed the flowers into boxes  
 the children were allowed to have     
 breakfast.The flowers were then       
 sent off to hospitals in London.In    
 one survey 6 out of 10 local people   
 confessed to believe in ghosts.       </content>
