		<content> Our Infant {school}is very old. It was
 first built in 1884. It was an old    
 British Board School. It was founded  
 so that each child "should be given   
 the best secular education that the   
 fund of the school may admit." When   
 the school started there were 50      
 children on the registars. If there   
 was a fair day, or during harvest time
 these numbers would drop to 2 or 3 as 
 in those days children did not have to
 attend school compulsarily as we do   
 now.There are 134 children in the     
 school at present divided into 4      
 classes. There are 37 reception       
 children,46 middle infants and 51 top 
 infants. In the playground there are  
 three tiples (climbing frames). When  
 the children's teacher is on          
 playground duty the children in that  
 class can play on them for that       
 playtime.                             </content>
