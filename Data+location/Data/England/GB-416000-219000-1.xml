		<content> Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire,
 is situated to the east of the A429   
 (Fosseway) and is a delightful{       
{Cotswold stone village,}popular with  
 tourists. The{River Windrush}flows    
 through the main street and is        
 bordered by a wide green and shaded by
 trees. The small villages of{Wyck     
{Rissington}and{Little Rissington}are  
 situated on a spring line at the foot 
 of a steep slope east of the Windrush 
 and Dikler valleys. The surrounding   
 area is mostly farmland, mainly down  
 to pasture. North of Bourton there is 
 some evidence of the Kingham to       
 Cheltenham railway track, closed in   
 1961. There are also traces of{Roman} 
 and{Saxon settlement}in the area.     
 Bourton now depends upon tourism for  
 its livelihood though the majority of 
 its inhabitants are either retired or 
 commute to work in neighbouring towns.</content>
