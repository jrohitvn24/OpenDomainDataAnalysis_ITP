		<title>16OLD PEOPLE IN EAST MERSEA</title>
		<content>{      A RETIRED FARMING COUPLE}       
  They were born in Australia and came 
 to live in East Mersea 50 years ago.  
 They came to work on a farm bought by 
 his father.They were surprised by the 
 peace and quiet when they first       
 arrived,but gradually they have grown 
 to cherish this aspect of East Mersea.
 In the 1930's when they moved in there
 was no electricity,no water and no    
 transport to the local town. Farming  
 was hard work as there was no         
 machinery. Horses were used for       
 ploughing and transport. Their        
 lifestyle has improved. They own a    
 car, shop in Colchester, arrange for  
 large items to be delivered and have a
 very comfortable home. They regret the
 loss of many friends, but they still  
 enjoy life in the local community.    
 They attend church in Colchester and  
 enjoy Whist_drives.                   </content>
