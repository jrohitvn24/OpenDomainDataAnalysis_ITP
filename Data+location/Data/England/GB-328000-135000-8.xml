 Main employers in the area are the    
 nuclear power station at Hinkley Point
 and Bridgwter Cellophane, which is a  
 subsiduary of the giant Courtald group
 of industries. Other factories include
 the Quantock Preserving Company and   
 Leffman's, both employing mostly      
 women. There are a large number of    
 professional people in this area e.g. 
 government officers,teachers, doctors,
 dentists and bankers. Many of the     
 town's smaller light industries have  
 either closed or moved from the area  
 due to the recession of the last few  
 years. Young people, especially, are  
 finding it difficult to get employment
 when they leave school.
