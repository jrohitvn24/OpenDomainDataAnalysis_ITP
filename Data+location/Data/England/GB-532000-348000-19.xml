		<title>19SIBSEY CHURCH</title>
		<content> On Thursday 4th of July 1985 Judy and 
 Zoe went to Sibsey Church to see Rev  
 Loakes. We asked him a few questions  
 about the church.                     
{The Church is a hundred and fifty one 
{years old. The Church has one hundred 
{and twenty five steps to the top. The 
{vicar started being a vicar in        
{1959. We asked the vicar what other   
{churches he looks after ? He said     
{Frithvile, New Bollingbroke and       
{Carrington and sometimes the          
{Methodist churches with whom we are   
{in partnership.                       
{Rev. Loakes is paid by the Diocesan   
{Board of Finance and the Board of     
{Commisioners. His work includes desk  
{work, visiting people at home,        
{committees and school assemblies.     
{People of all ages go to the church.  
{20-50 people go to church on a Sunday.
{There are about seven weddings a year.</content>
