		<title>05Whitley Village News</title>
		<content> The Whitley Village News was thought  
 up and started around{l975.}It is a   
 small monthly booklet containing news 
 of village matters. It is written,    
 typed, copied and distributed by the  
 villagers to every house. It begins   
 with a news letter from the Editor &amp;  
 continues with dates for{Barn dances, 
{Coffee evenings, Rose Queen, Plays,   
 etc., and a diary for the month. It   
 also records Birthdays and provides a 
 voice for any person or organisation  
 to reach all the village. The front of
 the Village News always has a drawing 
 made by someone from the village about
 activities or seasonal events. We now 
 have an extra booklet which holds the 
 telephone numbers of most people in   
 the Village. The W.V.N. is completely 
 independant, run by volunteers and    
 financially supported by and for the  
 people of the village.                </content>
