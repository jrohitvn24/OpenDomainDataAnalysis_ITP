		<content> TWICE A WEEK I GO TO THE COMMUNITY    
 CENTRE TO PRACTICE A PLAY WITH THE    
 JUNIOR DRAMA GROUP.IN APRIL WE        
 PERFORMED A PLAY "THE WHOLE TRUTH" ON 
 THE COMMUNITY CENTRE STAGE. IN THIS I 
 PLAYED"PINKY", A STUTTERING SCHOOLBOY.
 I WORE MY SCHOOL CLOTHES AND HAD SOME 
 MAKE-UP ON. IT WAS CERTAINLY GOOD FUN.
                                       
 AT POLEGATE SCOUTS WE DO ALL KINDS OF 
 THINGS. LAST WEEK WE WENT TO CAMP AT  
 BUSHY WOOD WHERE WE STAYED IN TENTS.  
 WE HAD TO COOK OUR OWN FOOD AND WE HAD
 TO GO TO AND FRO FROM THE FOREST FOR  
 WATER. WE HAD A GREAT SWAMP FIGHT     
 WHERE YOU THROW SLIMY MUD AT EACH     
 OTHER. I HAVE PASSED MY AXE AND KNIFE 
 TEST THAT ENABLES ME TO USE AN AXE AND
 KNIFE.AT THE MOMENT I AM WORKING FOR A
 BADGE CALLED THE SCOUTS' AWARD FOR    
 WHICH I HAVE TO PASS LOTS OF DIFFERENT
 TESTS.                                </content>
