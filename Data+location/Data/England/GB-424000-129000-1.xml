  This area can be divided into two.The
 western half contains one of the      
 largest semi-deciduous woodlands in   
 Southern England designated an area of
 Special Scientific Interest.The       
 Eastern half contains the pretty      
 village of West Tytherley(Tytherley is
 mentioned in the Domesday Book). This 
 village was part of the Washington    
 Singer Estate based on the Historic   
 House of Norman Court(now Northaw     
 School).It retains much of its        
 original character with timber framed 
 thatched cottages.Preservation is     
 apparent for both woodland and village
  An estimate for the whole area is    
 about 600 people but with trees,trees 
 and more trees!
