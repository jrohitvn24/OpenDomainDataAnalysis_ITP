		<content> The low rolling landscape consists of 
 chalky boulder clay overlying Oxford  
 clay.                                 
 Rainfall is low (450-575mm) The       
 winters are not severe but spring is  
 late and cold because of the heavy    
 clays, however sunshine is above the  
 national average.                     
 There are many different types of wild
 flowers, and birds and butterflies    
 abound and in the clean air, lichens  
 grow on buildings and trees.          
 Many trees have been plnted since     
 1973, replacing elms lost by disease. 
 Those planted in the village centre   
 commemorate the Silver Jubilee.       
 Cambridge Conservation Corps have     
 camped in the village hall and cleared
 woodland. Community Service Volunteers
 have cleared the banks of the River   
 Till through the village to stop      
 flooding.                             </content>
