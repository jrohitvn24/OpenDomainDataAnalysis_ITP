		<title>01LITTLE KIMBLE - GENERAL</title>
		<content>   Little Kimble and the surrounding   
 areas form a very rural part of South 
 Buckinghamshire on the edge of the    
{Chiltern Hills.}The {population}      
 numbers no more than{900}people       
 living in 35 houses in the village of 
 Little Kimble, between Clanking and   
 Brook Farm, on the Aylesbury road     
 (A4010); The rest live on the many    
 farms in the area.                    
   There are 2 Public Houses but no    
 shops or Places of Worship in this    
 block (The Parish Church for the      
 village is to the South, outside the  
 block), the nearest small town being  
{Wendover}some 5Km away to the east.   
   The London Midland Region railway   
 runs through the block to{Aylesbury}  
 but there are no stations in the      
 block.
