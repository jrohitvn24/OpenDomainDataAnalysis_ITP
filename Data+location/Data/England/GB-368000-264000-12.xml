		<title>12LOCAL HISTORY STANFORD 2</title>
		<content> The present church at Stanford was    
 built in 1769.  This was a new site,  
 as the original church and village had
 stood beside Stanford Court. The lake 
 now covers the site of these buildings
 but sometimes when the lake is low,   
 the foundations of the original church
 can be seen.                          
 When the church was rebuilt, some land
 was also given to the church, and this
 farmland is now managed by the Church 
 Commissioners.                        
 The Winnington family still take an   
 interest in the village, and Sir      
 Francis Winnington is a Churchwarden. 
 The local school, originally provided 
 by the Winningtons, is now the Village
 Hall, as local children are being     
 taken to Great Witley (3 miles away), 
 Lindridge (4 miles) or Tenbury Wells  
 (10 miles) for a state school         
 education.                            </content>
