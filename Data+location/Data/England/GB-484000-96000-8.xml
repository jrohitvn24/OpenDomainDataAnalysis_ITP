      We have found about 40 clubs or  
 groups in Sidlesham. They include     
 things like Scouts, Guides and        
 Brownies for children and aerobics    
 and Darts Club for adults. Every age  
 is covered.                           
 There is a Playschool for under-fives 
 and the Good Companions for old people
 The old people meet regularly and do  
 hand-crafts which they sell. The money
 pays for their outings and a mini-van.
     There are church clubs,a Bible    
 study group run by the vicar,the      
 Sunday School  and the Thursday Club  
  for games and crafts.                
      There is a British Legion group  
 and a Red Cross group and a Football  
 Club in the village                   
     There is a nature reserve in      
 the village and the friends of Pagham 
 Harbour help to look affer it.        </content>
