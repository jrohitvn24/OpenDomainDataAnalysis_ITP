		<title>12More Work at Langford School</title>
		<content>  The children use books for learning  
to read, for looking up information,   
and for enjoyment.Every classroom had  
lots of interesting books.             
  Lots of times during the week they   
can paint, draw, cut, stick, shape,    
model and do other Art and Craft Work. 
Sometimes pictures and models are made 
about their Topic Work.                
  Most of them enjoy their Drama, Music
and P.E. work. Once a week the older   
children go by coach to the indoor     
swimming pool in Witney.They also do   
Country Dancing in the Summer.         
  In 1984 the school had a computer for
the first time. They bought an RML480Z 
which is a 64K computer.It is used in  
all the classes.They have lots of tapes
and they like the Arrow and Write tapes
best.(Arrow is a LOGO program and Write
is a Word Processing program).
