		<content>     Home life has changed a lot in the
 last twenty years.Now most people have
 a lot of electrical machines to help  
 them with the housework like washing  
 machines,tumble driers,freezers and   
 fridges for storing food.There are    
 electric mixers and kettles in the    
 kitchen and hoovers to keep the house 
 clean.                                
   There are no shops in our area and  
 most people go to the local town of   
 Ross-on-Wye once a week to the        
 supermarkets to buy groceries and     
 frozen foods.There is a market held   
 there twice a week,on Thursday and    
 Saturday.We eat a lot of frozen foods 
 like fish fingers and beefburgers.Our 
 nearest shops are the village stores, 
 which are also post offices,at Linton 
 and Weston-under-Penyard.
