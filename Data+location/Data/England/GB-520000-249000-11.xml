		<content>{Potton}has had its{own fire engine}   
 from about the{late eighteenth        
{century,}acquired after the disastrous
{fire}of{1783.}There was another       
 devastating{fire}in{1877}in which year
 the{Potton Fire Brigade}was formed.   
 In June{1878}there was the{worst fire 
{in living memory in Bedfordshire}.It  
 started in Potton in a barn occupied  
 by Thomas Abbott. Before 1939 when the
 fire brigade lost its volunteer status
 under the Fire Brigade Act and was    
 taken over by the Biggleswade District
 Council,{it was the only volunteer    
{force}for miles around and one of the 
 oldest in the country. In 1946 Potton 
 Fire Brigade was under threat of      
 closure. However{today Potton still   
{does have its own unmanned fire       
{station.}Thirteen people from Potton  
 work at the fire station on a part    
 time basis.                           </content>
