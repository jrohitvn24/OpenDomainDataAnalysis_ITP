		<content> The first church was built in 1304 and
 destroyed in 1703. The present church 
 was built in 1714. William de Sale was
 the first rector. Music was once      
 provided by an orchestra. The present 
 organ was built in 1857. A gallery,   
 built in 1743 for a growing           
 congregation, still exists. The       
 baptistry, built on poor foundations, 
 is falling away from the main building
 .The tower, vestries and lych gate    
 were added in 1887 to mark Queen      
 Victoria's Jubilee. The timbered roof 
 in hammer beam style dates from 1714. 
   We asked children in our school if  
 they attend a church or Sunday school;
 48% do. The majority attend the United
 Reformed Church. Other churches in our
 area are Church of England,           
 congregational, Methodist,            
 Evangelical, and Roman Catholic.
