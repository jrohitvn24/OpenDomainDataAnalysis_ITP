		<content> Rising from under 30 metres to just   
 over 40 metres the area consists      
 largely of a ridge which has{very}    
 gentle gradients.The more gentle west 
 facing slope is dissectd by a number  
 of valleys with small streams in them.
 Some parts of their channels have been
 alterred &amp; with hedges form field     
 boundaries.Clay (&amp; some sandstone)    
 covers large parts &amp; has been dug out,
 on a small scale,in the past,for the  
 making of bricks for some of the farm 
 buildings.There are therefore,a great 
 many small ponds scattered around,some
 being natural as it is lowland &amp; the  
 water-table is close to the surface   
 and others being small shallow,flooded
 workings.Many small marshy areas also 
 occur in the impervious clay.         
 By Platt's Lane there is also a larger
 very shallow pond with reeds growing  
 to a height of 150 centimetres or so. </content>
