		<content>{Dutch Elm Disease}spread rapidly      
 across the country in the 1970s for   
 the first time in several centuries.  
 Elms were dominant in hedgerow and    
 woodland and the death of almost all  
 left dead trees to be felled,leaving  
 gaping holes unlikely to be filled.   
 Many of the hedgerows were removed al 
 together,making cultivation by machine
 much faster.A few remain as shelter   
 belts to protect crops against wind.  
 The fewer,larger fields show on the   
 1:25000 map of 1982,though almost half
 the hedges on this map are missing    
 today.                                
{Hedges}in the Epping Upland area      
 contain many species,a sign of their  
 great age.Some are allowed to grow    
 into trees,others are cut by flails,  
 but few are properly layered to form  
 boundaries secure against cattle:if   
 needed,strands of barbed wire will do.</content>
