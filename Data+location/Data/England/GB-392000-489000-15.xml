		<content> The parish church is St Oswald's in   
 Askrigg, the incumbency being in the  
 gift of Trinity College, Cambridge.   
 The Church has established The        
 Askrigg Foundation to promote         
 Christian work in the community and   
 Askind to foster employment. The Low  
 Mill residential youth centre with its
 handicapped persons' wing is concrete 
 proof of the Foundation's worth.      
                                       
 The Methodist congregation is large   
 and healthy and there are chapels in  
 both Askrigg and Bainbridge. A strong 
 oecumenical feeling means a lot of    
 shared activities and joint services. 
                                       
 The Society of Friends (Quakers) has a
 Meeting in Bainbridge, where Quakerism
 has been prominent since George Fox   
 preached in the area in 1652.
