		<content> Critchells Green is a favourite spot  
 for walking dogs.                     
 There is a good cross section of      
 people living in the village; some    
 work locally, some go into the        
 neighbouring towns. There is a lively 
 social life with many clubs and       
 organisations for all ages. The church
 acts as a focus for many of these. The
 village is a lively community where   
 good neighbourliness abounds.         
 Newcomers remark on the friendliness  
 of the village and the warmth of      
 welcome they receive.
