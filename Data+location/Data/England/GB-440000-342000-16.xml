		<content> There are alot of sporting things to  
 do in Shipley, there is a golf course,
 horse riding and plenty of space for  
 walking. The place where people come  
 and bring their caravans and park them
 is at the bottom of Cinderhill        
 Coppice. The hill at the top is fenced
 off and there are plenty of little    
 saplings which look likely to grow    
 into a mini forest. Home Farm is      
 another attraction that people go to  
 see, especially school parties. They  
 keep many sorts of farm animals which 
 visitors are encouraged to meet at    
 close quarters.
