		<title>10S.W.GUILDFORD:PUBLIC HOUSES</title>
		<content>  The Public Houses in this area vary  
 in some respects, though none are     
 particularly memorable. The Bull's    
 Head, The Three Pigeons, and The Royal
 Oak are all traditional, friendly and 
 have atmosphere. But The Greyhound,   
 The Star, The Spread Eagle, and The   
 Jolly Farmer are disappointing for    
 such an attractive old town as this.  
 The Brittannia has the attraction of  
 being on the river though little else.
  The pubs most attractive to young    
 people are The Black Friars and The   
 King's Head; the former is tastelessly
 decorated and fails to create a       
 pleasant atmosphere whereas The King's
 Head has friendly service, a quite    
 understated appeal and a garden which 
 other Guildford pubs sadly lack.      
  Generally, the pubs are more rowdy   
 than cosy and more town-like than     
 countrified.     J.Roberts &amp; J.Baldock</content>
