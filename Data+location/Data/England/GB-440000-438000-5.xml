		<content> In this area the A64 trunk road       
 crosses the A1 trunk road, with the   
 A64 underpassing the A1 and 2 slip    
 roads servicing the A1.The rest of the
 section is entirely farmland with a   
 minor access road running along the   
 Northern section to the               
 farmhouses. Eight families live in the
 five buildings which are owned by Mr. 
 W. Illingworth. The farmland is a     
 mixture of crops (sugar  beet,        
 turnips, wheat, barley, oats,  grass) 
 and livestock (cattle and sheep).     
 Also, in the middle of the Northern   
 Section in Spen Farm, the University  
 of Leeds' Field Station and National  
 Institute of Agricultural Botany

 West section there is a Little Chef   
 restaurant on the A64.
