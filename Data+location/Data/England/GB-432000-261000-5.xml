 house animals and farm machinery.     
 At the time of our visit there were   
 about 20 beef cattle on the premises  
 all itensively farmed. There were 18  
 heifers also bred as beef cattle.The  
 main breeds were                      
 Fresian,Charolais,and Blonde          
 D'Aquataine,which were generally      
 bought as calves ,but the farmer had  
 recently bought a breeding bull and   
 hoped to produce his own calves.      
 Some orphan lambs were kept in one    
 building .These were all bottle       
 fed.Another building housed the barley
 crushing machine.                     
 The main crop was wheat with some     
 winter wheat.                         
 The family owned a horse.
