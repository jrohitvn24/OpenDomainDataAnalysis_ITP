  Rishton's houses are typical of an   
industrial town. The centre is mainly  
terraced with some new sheltered       
accommodation. There is a council      
estate of about 60 houses nearby.      
 The newer privately owned houses are  
on the outskirts of the town. The      
older, smaller terraces with small     
back yards, built for coalplaces and   
toilets, lie to the south of the High  
Street and date from 1875 to 1900.     
Most are brick built with slate roofs. 
 Newer, larger terraces, often with    
small front gardens were built on the  
north side between 1890 and 1913. Many 
have datestones, several with royal    
connections, e.g. Albert Terrace 1893, 
Duke of Cambridge Place 1895, and      
Coronation Terrace 1911. These are     
mainly built of stone.
