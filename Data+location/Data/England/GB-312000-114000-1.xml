		<title>01Description of Area.</title>
		<content> Plateau at about 250 metres O.D.      
 dissected by deep valleys with steep  
 sides forming tributaries to River    
 Culm, flowing west.The river divides  
 this area from the village of Hemyock,
 where the road from Wellington crosses
 by the St.Ivel Milk Factory, which    
 also owns the several nearby cottages.
  Whitehall and Rosemary Lane have the 
 largest concentration of houses.  A   
 network of narrow lanes with high     
 hedges serves between 20-30 small     
 farms and other dwellings, new and    
 old, from bungalow to medieval manor  
 (Whitehall) and long houses.  The     
 mainroad is now too small for the many
 heavy milk lorries.  However these    
 same poor roads help to conserve the  
 beauty of the Blackdown countryside.
