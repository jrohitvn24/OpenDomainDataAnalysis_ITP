		<title>04THE RIDINGS SHOPPING CENTRE</title>
		<content> The main shopping areas in Wakefield  
 are the pedestrian precinct, the      
 indoor and outdoor markets and the    
 newly opened{Ridings Centre.}The      
 centre was started in 1981 and opened 
 in 1984. There are over 100 different 
 shops which include a public house, a 
 major supermarket and other nationally
 known shops such as Mothercare, C &amp; A,
 Marks and Spencer, British Home       
 Stores and W.H.Smith. Shopping is on  
 three different levels and because of 
 the centres proximity to Wakefield    
 Cathedral these have been named{All   
{Saints Walk, Bishopgate Walk}and      
{Cathedral Walk.}Perhaps the most      
 attractive feature of the Ridings     
 development is the central glass wall 
 climber lift. Indoor gardens, a food  
 court, a play centre for young        
 children all combine to make this a   
 very important feature of Wakefield.  </content>
