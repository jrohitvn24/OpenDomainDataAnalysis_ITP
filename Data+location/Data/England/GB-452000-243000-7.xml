		<title>07The Washington Tomb Sulgrave</title>
		<content>Inside the church the bodies of        
Lawrence and Amee Washington,ancestors 
of George Washington,the first         
President of the United States of      
America (1789),are buried under a slab 
of Hornton Stone.At the head is a brass
showing the family arms,maybe the      
origin of the Stars and Stripes.Lower  
down is the headless brass of Lawrence 
wearing a doublet,a loose gown with    
sleeves edged with fur and broad-toed  
shoes,the costume of a well to do      
yeoman in Tudor times.Besides this is  
an empty space where the brass of Amee 
rested  and below this are Â£the        
weepers',their children,four boys and  
seven girls.These two brasses were     
stolen in 1885 but were found and      
replaced in 1924.Many American tourists
visit this memorial after they have    
been to the nearby Sulgrave Manor.
