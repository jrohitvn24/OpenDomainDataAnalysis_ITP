		<title>04New Developments in March.</title>
		<content>{ Estover House,}a large, empty, old   
 farmhouse is now for sale and the     
 grounds are being sold as{building    
{plots.                                
  Part of{March Town Football Ground}  
 has been sold and some{bungalows}are  
 being built there.In{St.John's Road}a 
 new{vicarage}has been built.Old houses
 are being knocked down in{New Park}and
 are being rebuilt for{people buying a 
{house for the first time.             
  There is another{new development}off 
 Elliott Road, called{Windsor Drive.   
 They are{detached bungalows and       
{houses}with hardwood framed windows   
 and patio doors. We found that the    
{post code}was written on the street   
 name and we think this is a good idea.
   All property, old or new, seems to  
 have its{own garden}and we feel this  
 is because there is{plenty of land    
 available here.                       </content>
