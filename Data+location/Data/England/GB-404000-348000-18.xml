		<content>Nowadays most families in the area own 
a motor vehicle as most of us travel   
for shopping, work, medical services,  
recreation and leisure.                
80% of the children in Waterhouses     
Middle School travel to school by bus, 
10.5% travel by school taxi or car, 8% 
walk and just a few come on bicyles.   
After the decline of public transport  
in recent years, we now have a "staged"
transport system, whereby the public   
can use any of the school buses. The   
Education Authority gets a diesel      
subsidy from the Government which means
that rural transport has become viable.
The only remaining railway line now    
transports stone from the quarries. A  
disused branch line links the quarries 
to Waterhouses. Along the southern     
border of our area, the track bed of   
the old tramway from the quarries to   
Froghall is a reminder of the past.    </content>
