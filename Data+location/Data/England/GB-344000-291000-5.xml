		<title>05RECTORY WOOD CHURCH STRETTON</title>
		<content>   Originally{Rectory Wood}was a       
 pleasure ground belonging to the      
 former Rectory before the County      
 Council bought it in 1960. The folly  
 was built by the Church Stretton      
 Rector and taken over by the water    
 board in the war. There are two grave 
 stones which were from the old church 
 and they are now bridges over the     
 stream.                               
   There is quite a lot of{wildlife}in 
 there and these are some of the       
 animals that live there:              
 foxes, squirrels, birds, moles, voles 
 and weasles. The stream comes from the
 reservoir and has got fish like       
 trout.                                
   There are many interesting trees    
 including a Spanish Chestnut which is 
{300 years old.}The lime tree has got a
 spiral route going round it and you   
 can climb quite high.                 </content>
