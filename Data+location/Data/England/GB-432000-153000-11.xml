		<title>11Riding around my house</title>
		<content>  When I go out for a ride I sometimes 
 go on the roads. I try to avoid going 
 on the roads, because they are narrow 
 and windy and some people drive too   
 fast.                                 
  The farmers have shut up some of the 
 bridle paths. So are some of the      
 tracks . When I go out riding in the  
 summer there is a big chicken farm and
 a lot of flies swarwm around there and
 my pony gets itchy. If I'm allowed to,
 I go riding in the woods around our   
 house. I see a lot of wild life around
 our area.I see animals as such as     
 foxes, birds, deer, pheasants and     
 badgers on the Downs. There is a      
 valley called Hidden Valley which has 
 an old broken-down house in it.       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
