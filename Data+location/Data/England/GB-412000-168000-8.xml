		<content> The river contains many kinds of{fish,
 such as carp, trout and salmon. There 
 are also smaller creatures like       
 shrimps, tadpoles, newts, and frogs.  
 Local children often play near the    
 river and fish in it in the season.   
 In the spring swans can be seen       
 nesting on the banks and gliding on   
 the water. A moorhen's nest can       
 sometimes be spotted, too.            
 In summer parts of the river dry up.  
{Fish}become stranded in mud and pools.
 At this time children enjoy building  
 dams of mud, stones, bricks and weeds.
 Two or three times a year men         
 from the water board come to cut the  
 weeds growing in the water, to stop it
 getting clogged up.
