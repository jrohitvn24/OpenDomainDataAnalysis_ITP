		<title>17The Parish Council</title>
		<content>    Barnburgh Parish Council was formed
 in 1894 and took its present          
 constitution and powers under the     
 Local Government Act 1972. The Parish 
 Council is the most local and         
 accessible form of government and very
 much the organ of local opinion.Our   
 Parish includes about 720 dwellings   
 and over 2000 inhabitants in the      
 villages of Barnburgh,Harlington and  
 Melton Mill Lane.                     
   There are 7 Parish Councillors and  
 elections are held every 4 years. The 
 Council deals with such matters as    
 planning, highways, public footpaths, 
 tree planting, public seating and the 
 general appearance of all parts of the
 village.                              
   The Parish Council has three        
 part-time enployees - the clerk, the  
 greenkeeper and the handyman.
