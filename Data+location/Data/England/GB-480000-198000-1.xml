		<content> WE COVER PART OF AN{AREA OF OUT       
{STANDING NATURAL BEAUTY}HIGH IN THE   
 CHILTERN HILLS BETWEEN HIGH WYCOMBE   
 AND PRINCES RISBOROUGH. THIS SURVEY   
 COVERS THE VILLAGES OF{LACEY GREEN AND
{LOOSLEY ROW AND PARTS OF SPEEN,       
{SAUNDERTON AND WALTERS ASH.}THEY ALL  
 BEGAN AS SMALL FARMING SETTLEMENTS IN 
 ANCIENT TIMES ALTHOUGH TODAY THEY HAVE
 EXPANDED CONSIDERABLY INTO DORMITORY  
 AREAS INCLUDING OFFICIAL MARRIED      
 QUARTERS FOR SERVICE PERSONNEL. THE   
 PRINCIPAL LAND USE IS AGRICULTURE BUT 
 MOST PEOPLE HAVE OTHER OCCUPATIONS.   
 SOME WORK IN LOCAL INDUSTRY OR{RAF    
{WALTERS ASH}BUT MANY TRAVEL OUT OF THE
 AREA TO WORK. THE ESTIMATED POPULATION
 OF WHAT WE WILL REFER TO AS LACEY     
 GREEN IS NOT MORE THAN 4000.
