		<title>19BURGHFIELD-A TYPICAL SUNDAY</title>
		<content> Matthew is a pupil at Garland Junior  
 School.Here,he descibes a typical     
 Sunday.                               
  "After breakfast,we usually go down  
 to the woods and jump off a tree that 
 is broken at the base.I used to jump  
 off the second highest branch,but now 
 I jump off the highest.Then we go to  
 the stream and make boats from pieces 
 of wood.Afterwards,I get my football  
 and we play "Three and In",that is,   
 when someone has scored three goals,  
 he becomes the goalkeeper.            
  "Dinner is usually roast pork,lamb,  
 beef or chicken with cauliflower,peas,
 potatoes and carrots,followed by      
 peaches and cream.                    
  "After dinner,we go to the cornfields
 walking in the tracks.Then we go to   
 the ford or the old Anderson bomb     
 shelter.After tea,we play in the park 
 until it is time to have a bath."     </content>
