		<title>10Fishing from Blackhead</title>
		<content> The Blackhead is a bleak outcast      
 headland near the town of St.Austell, 
 Cornwall.It is something about this   
 headland that attracts people whether 
 it is to ramble over the rocks and    
 isolated beaches or to fish in the    
 heavily over-populated mackeral runs, 
 the Blackhead has had thousands of    
 feet trample it's coast.Visitors and  
 Cornishmen alike come here to marvel  
 at the barren,jagged coastline.       
   Fishermen from all parts congregate 
 here.They fish with floats because    
 unless you can cast 300yards weights  
 are hopeless thanks to the deep,dense 
 kelp beds.On a good day you can go    
 home with a bag full.On a bad day     
 normally loads and loads of garfish,  
 exciting to a visitor,a pest to a     
 local.People socialise with stories of
 the one that got away and "have you   
 caught anything"in different accents. </content>
