		<title>07FARMING IN POTT SHRIGLET.</title>
		<content> This is mainly grassland country      
 rising from 400ft in the west to 600  
 ft. in the east. Most of the farms    
 have milking cows, milk being         
 collected daily, using the tankers of 
 the "Milk Marketing Board" to take it 
 to dairies for bottling &amp; distribution
 Some is farm-bottled and sold to house
 holders. Young stock are raised for   
 both milk and beef. Cattle are mainly 
 Fresians for milk and Charolais or    
 Hereford cross for beef. Since the    
 coming of milk quotas in 1984, fewer  
 cows are kept and on some farms sheep 
 have been introduced to utilise the   
 grass. On the higher land sheep have  
 always been kept. Some barley is grown
 for stock feed. Hay and sileage are   
 made for winter fodder. Acreage       
 averages 80 to 100 acres per farm.
