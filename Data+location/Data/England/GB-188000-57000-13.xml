 There is a doctors surgery at St.     
 Columb road where people can go if    
 they are sick,but the practice really 
 is operated from St.Columb Major which
 is about 4 miles away.The doctors are 
 called Emrys-Jones,Grundy,Gay,Rees,   
 Turfitt and Wight.There is a surgery  
 at Padstow as well.                   
 There is no dentist in the area.The   
 school dentist inspects children's    
 teeth every year,and gives treatment  
 at the Health Centre in Newquay.Anyone
 wanting private treatment has to go to
 Newquay or somewhere else.            
 There are no hospitals in the area,the
 nearest one is a small one at Newquay.
 If there is an accident or something  
 serious patients have to go to either 
 of the two Truro hospitals-Treliske   
 Hospital or the City Hospital.
