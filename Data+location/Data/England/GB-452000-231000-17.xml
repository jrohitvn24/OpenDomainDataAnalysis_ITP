		<title>17SOCIAL LIFE IN CROUGHTON 1</title>
		<content> Croughton is a pleasant village in    
 which to live, although it is not as  
 decorative as many in the area.  Most 
 people are outgoing and friendly, and 
 newcomers usually find themselves made
 welcome very quickly.  There is no    
 apparent social hierarchy in the      
 village now, and a fairly egalitarian 
 approach prevails.  Social activities 
 revolve around the Blackbird Public   
 House and the Village Club.  The      
 publican has a 'Cosy Hour' on Mondays 
 for the OAP's to meet and chat, and   
 there are teams for Darts, Pool,      
 Dominoes and Aunt Sally.  There is    
 usually Live Entertainment on Fridays.
 The Club is located in the old Reading
 Room, and is run by a committee. Whist
 drives and other events are held      
 regularly, as are discos and events   
 for the younger members.
