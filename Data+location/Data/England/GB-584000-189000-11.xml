		<title>11Games in the Playground.</title>
		<content> One of the best games that we play in 
 the Playground is called "Had".  In   
 this game one person is chosen to be  
 "It".  This person has to run very    
 fast and try to catch any of the other
 people who are playing the game.  If  
 the person who is "It" touches another
 person, then it is their turn to be   
 "It" and they have to do the catching.
 The boys also play a lot of football  
 and the girls like doing handstands.In
 the autumn we play "conkers".  We     
 collect the shiny brown fruits from   
 the Horse Chestnut trees that grow in 
 our woods. We bore a hole in the      
 middle of the fruit, which we call a  
 conker. Through this hole we thread a 
 piece of string and tie a knot at one 
 end. One person dangles a conker while
 another person, keeping their piece of
 string nice and tight tries to hit and
 smash the dangling conker. Great fun! </content>
