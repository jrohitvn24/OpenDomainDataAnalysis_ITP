		<content> In all of England there are few places
 like the delightful village of        
 Painswick with its grey stone houses  
 and 15th century church.The walls of  
 the church are still red in some      
 places from the flames which forced   
 the parliamentary men to surrender in 
 the civil war.A legend has it that    
 there can never be more than 99 Yew   
 trees around the church and that all  
 attempts to plant 100th have failed.  
 But when we counted we found 120 yew  
 trees!.In the church,in 1540 Sir      
 William Kingston governor of the tower
 of London was buried. Many motorists  
 on the lovely run slow down to see the
 old grey Court House with tall        
 chimneys and many gables.             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
