		<title>01A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF AREA</title>
		<content>  The first impression one gets of the 
 area upon entering via the busy A249  
 link road is of a semi-rural landscape
 hard by an industrial complex and port
 facility at Sheerness. Once one       
 penetrates into the area it becomes   
 clear that it provides a good deal of 
 housing and farmland in fairly equal  
 proportions. The Isle of Sheppey takes
 its name from sheep and one will not  
 need to look far to find evidence of  
 these. There has been a rapid growth  
 in the amount and variety of houses in
 the area, mainly being small          
 developments and many of which are    
 self built. Also within its bounds are
 a fine old abbey, golf course, shops, 
 garages, several pubs, a hospital,    
 cricket, soccer and rugby grounds,    
 equestrian centres and several        
 interesting walks offering fine views 
 of the island and beyond.             </content>
