 In l948 after the school in Crantock  
 closed the pupils were admitted to    
 Cubert.  At one time the old village  
 hall was used as a classroom and then 
 in l959 an extra building was added.  
 By l975 the first phase of a new      
 school consisting of a hall, library, 
 classroom and kitchen was built in the
 adjacent field.  Further additions    
 of staff facilities and another class-
 room were completed in l977.          
                                       
 The present staff includes a head,    
 deputy, 2 full and one part-time      
 assistants.  There are 2 additional   
 non-teaching posts for special needs  
 and children under 5.  A further 9    
 people are employed as clerk, kitchen 
 and cleaning staff.  In July l985 the 
 number on roll was l28. At 11+ the    
 children transfer to Newquay School.  </content>
