  "I was very excited about my mark,and
 to see what  other people had made. I 
 entered a decorated paper plate and   
 made toffees. I won a lot of races at 
 the flower show. There were flowers in
 unusual vases like a tea-pot or a     
 gnome. There were quite a lot of      
 beautiful bouquets on display."

 first, then a genie was second and a  
 ring master was third.Last of all Miss

 stocks and wet sponges thrown at her! </content>
