   The stocks in Penkridge are situated
by the Public Library off the Cannock  
Road.They have been locked up to stop  
them being vandalised.They have been   
left,as they were from the past        
century,not being altered or           
demolished,like some of the surrounding
buildings.Behind the stocks you can    
find a building,with bars across the   
windows,where the people were locked   
up.One building which hasn't been      
knocked down is the White Hart public  
house and hotel with its white washed  
walls and distinctive black beams.
