		<title>06THE PINE WOODS</title>
		<content> THIS AREA OF CONIFEROUS WOODLAND HAS  
 BEEN PLANTED SINCE THE EARLY 1900'S.  
 THE ORIGINAL IDEA WAS TO STABILSE THE 
 DUNES TO ENABLE THE CONSTRUCTION OF AN
 ESPLANADE ALONG THE COAST (THIS HAS   
 NEVER BEEN BUILT).                    
 THE MAIN SPECIES PLANTED WERE SCOTS   
 PINE AND CORSICAN PINE.               
 THIS AREA, BECAUSE IT IS CUT OFF FROM 
 OTHER WOODLAND, IS STILL THE HOME OF  
 THE RED SQUIRREL. THE RED SQUIRREL    
 RESERVE IS FENCED OFF BUT MANY CAN BE 
 SEEN FROM THE ACCESS PATHS.
