		<title>16ST MARY'S CHURCH</title>
		<content>      St Mary's church is in the centre
 of Alverstoke village. Lots of people 
 attend services there every week. The 
 church has a tall, winding tower and a
 wooden lychgate.  There is no room in 
 the grave yard for any more graves (no
 one has been buried here for 10       
 years).  Inside, the centre of the    
 church is a gold painted brass lectern
 in the shape of a golden eagle. There 
 is also a marble font and lots of     
 plaques fixed to the walls.  There is 
 a golden bell on the tower, with the  
 clock face in roman numerals. The bell
 is surrounded with finely carved      
 gargoyles.  The church is made of a   
 strong type of stone and the roof of  
 red slate.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
