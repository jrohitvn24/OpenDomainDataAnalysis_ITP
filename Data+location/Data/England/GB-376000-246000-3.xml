		<content> Morgan Motors in Malvern is the only  
 place in the world which makes the    
 famous Morgans. They have a two seater
 or four seater, which can cost        
 anything from Â£9,000 up to Â£14,000.   
 Morgans are hand made and have a      
 wooden chassis. The waiting list for a
 Morgan is five years. There are about 
 one hundred and fifteen people who    
 work at Morgan Motors. one hundred    
 people work on the factory floor      
 and fifteen people work in the        
 offices. Three types of engines are   
 used for the Morgans. They are the    
 Ford XR3, the Fiat injected engine and
 the Rover engines. Morgans started in 
 1902 by Mr. Morgan's father and it has
 been passed down the family. Only     
 about eight Morgans are made a week   
 because they are hand made.
