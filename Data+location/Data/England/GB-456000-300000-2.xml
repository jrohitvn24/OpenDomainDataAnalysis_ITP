		<content>      Over the road from us the houses 
 are being knocked down because they   
 were only concrete and they would fall
 down in about a year. Before the      
 houses got knocked down all the kids  
 were smashing the windows and in one  
 of the houses there was a carpet what 
 had been left there and the kids set  
 fire to it. Every time a car goes by  
 in our street the dogs chase it.      
      About 2 minutes away is Tick Tock
 Park where there are swings,slides and
 a metal van to play on. There is also 
 a{shop}what sells sweets. Round the   
 corner there is a{mobile shop}what    
 sells bread,milk,hot pies and things. 
 Down the road there is a{Fish and Chip
{Shop}which got burgled. The burglars  
 took their{Television,Video}and       
{Microwave}but they were insured so    
 they bought new ones. Nearly every    
 house on our street has been burgled. </content>
