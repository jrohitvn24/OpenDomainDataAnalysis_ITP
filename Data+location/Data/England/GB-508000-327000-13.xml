		<title>13EMPLOYMENT AROUND RIPPINGALE</title>
		<content>{Employment in the district}has changed
 radically in the past 20 years.Both   
 men and women were traditionally      
 employed on the land but women have   
 virtually left{agriculture}for light  
 and service industries and only about 
 15% of the men who were in farming    
 remain.This{mobility of labour}has    
 been brought about largely by the use 
 of cars and the upsurge of a large    
 number of{small workshops}making a    
 great variety of goods.In nearby towns
 articles as diverse as lightning      
 conductors for South America,gloves   
 for Harrods and parts for atomic power
 stations are made.Potters and other   
 artisans have set up in the vicinity. 
 It is,though,the car that has turned  
 the labour force from a static to a   
 mobile one.A proportion of the        
 community is unemployed,reflecting the
{serious nationwide shortage of jobs.  </content>
