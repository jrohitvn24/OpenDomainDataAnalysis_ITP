		<title>13Near Grantham:Welby Warren</title>
		<content> Welby Warren is a typical farm on this
 heathland area east of Grantham.The   
 extensive farm buildings are not      
 actually lived in; the tenant farmer  
 lives several miles away in           
 Newton.There is virtually no livestock
 at present(late 1985)The main crops   
 are wheat, borage,evening primrose,   
 sugar beet,oil seed rape and          
 barley.The farm is very well supplied 
 with farm machinery.There is a combine
 harvester,tractors,crop               
 sprayers,lorries,silos and other      
 storage machinery,a grain             
 elevator and other cultivation        
 equipment.The soil is very light and  
 is fairly easy to work and it drains  
 easily being on limestone.The land    
 usage has changed in the last ten     
 years away from grass land because the
 light soil is so much better for      
 arable farming.                       </content>
