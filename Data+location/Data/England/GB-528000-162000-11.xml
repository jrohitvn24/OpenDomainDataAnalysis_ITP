		<title>11Garden Centre</title>
		<content>Near the park is the garden centre. It 
used to be a swimming pool owned by the
council, and was built in the 1940's.  
Soon it began to make a loss because   
the summers were too short. Then a wide
crack appeared in the pool which was   
beyond repair and it closed 10 years   
ago. The pool is filled in now but the 
diving board is still there. It was    
bought and converted to a garden       
centre,which opened in 1981. It covers 
about 5 acres and you can buy plants   
and trees, statues, fish, swimming     
pools and even camping equipment. It is
very busy. The owner is very rich now, 
and you sometimes see his Rolls Royce  
parked outside.
