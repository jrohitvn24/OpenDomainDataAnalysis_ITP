 The games played by children in the   
 school playground rely on very little 
 or inexpensive equipment.Many are     
 variations on the theme of one        
 ettempting to catch everyone else.The 
 remainder are seasonal determined by  
 the weather,skipping and soft tennis  
 in the summer and football in the     
 winter .'Conkers'is autumnal because  
 'conkers'are the seeds of             
 horsechestnut tree.A hole is bored    
 through the seed it is then threaded  
 onto a piece of string about long.Each
 player tries to break the opponents   
 'conker'by hitting it with his own.The
 conkers are hardened in various       
 ways.Soaking them in vineger and slow 
 baking is one method .Catch games have
 exciting names such as jailer,British 
 Bull Dog and Rotten Egg,most need no  
 equipment at most a ball.             </content>
