		<content>   The school at Martinstown was small,
 with only 60 children, with 3 teachers
 Miss Stickland, Miss Bailey and Miss  
 Chapel.                               
   Pupils had to know their tables or  
 be severely punished, even Mary       
 Bowring once got the cane!Outings were
 rare but in hot summer weather pupils 
 took their desks onto the Church Green
 for outdoor work which must have      
 pleased them and their teachers. The  
 school sometimes did plays to which   
 parents were invited but parties were 
 unknown. During the summer, Mrs Duke  
 from the Manor Farm would hold a hay  
 making party for the children and this
 was the high spot of the year.Pupils  
 who didn't go to Grammar School stayed
 on at the village school until they   
 were 14 years old. Mary got a         
 scholarship to Dorchester Green       
 School.                               </content>
