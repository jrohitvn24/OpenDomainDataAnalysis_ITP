		<title>10LANDSCAPE-SHIREBROOK VALLEY</title>
		<content> The Shirebrook Valley is an open space
 with housing all round. Many people   
 walk in the valley each day or go     
 across it to get from one place to    
 another.At first sight it seems very  
 unsightly with old mine               
 workings,factories,sewage works and   
 refuse tips all close together.However
 these things, as well as the natural  
 life there, provide a lot of          
 interest.Two new ventures are at      
 present changing the valley. One is a 
 new road which will speed up traffic  
 from a new suburb of Sheffield on its 
 way to the city centre.The road will  
 pass right through the middle of the  
 valley cutting through some old       
 footpaths.The second change is a      
 Countryside Management Project which  
 is trying to conserve natural life and
 evidence of past industry.
