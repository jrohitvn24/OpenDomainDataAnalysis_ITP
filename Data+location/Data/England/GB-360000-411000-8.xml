		<title>08ST.KATHARINE'S CHURCH</title>
		<content>    The earliest record of the church  
 dates back to 1388; it was a chantry  
 endowed for masses for the dead. The  
 chantry was dismantled at the         
 dissolution of the monasteries.       
    Most of the present church was     
 built during the reign of Elizabeth I.
 There are still traces of the 14th.   
 century tower and much Elizabethan    
 work remains. In 1766 the church was  
 enlarged and in 1905 the chancel and  
 nave were rebuilt. The clock on the   
 tower was erected in memory of the    
 dead of the 1939-45 World War.        
    The church, standing on the highest
 part of the ridge on which Blackrod   
 was built, is a landmark for many     
 miles around.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
