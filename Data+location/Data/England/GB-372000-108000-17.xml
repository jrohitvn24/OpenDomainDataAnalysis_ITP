		<title>17The Portman Hunt</title>
		<content>   Our survey showed that few people in
 the village are actually involved with
 horses, however those who are         
 participate in hunting, racing, and   
 horse shows. The Portman Hunt members 
 come from all around, and Hazelbury   
 Bryan can be judged as the centre. The
 hunt often goes through the village   
 during the season which last from     
 November to May, and most farmers     
 cooperate. The Master of the Hunt     
 issues a certificate to would be point
 to pointers which allows them to enter
 their horses in races at local        
 meetings. The Portman Races are held  
 at Badbury Rings. About six families  
 in our 'D' block own race horses. Some
 also compete in the local shows       
 including gymkhanas promoted by hte   
 various hunts which include Blackmore 
 and Sparkford Vale, South and West    
 Wiltshire and South Dorset.           </content>
