		<content>{Bleakholt Animal Sanctuary}depends    
 entirely on donations and has no other
 form of income. The general public can
 become members by paying an annual    
 suhbscription. Functions such as      
 jumble sales and other money_raising  
 events occur throughout the year.     
 During the summer volunteers help     
 exercise the animals.                 
    The animals include many breeds of 
 dogs, cats, ponies and donkeys, as    
 well as smaller animals such as ducks,
 geese and even squirrels which have   
 been given by the National Trust.They 
 do however, refuse to accept          
 Tropical species as they require      
 heated cages and so would be too      
 costly to maintain.                   
    The public are free to go to the   
 farm and for a donation can take an   
 animal providing they can offer it a  
 good home.                            </content>
