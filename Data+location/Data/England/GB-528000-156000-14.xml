  Chipstead has a population of        
somewhere between ninty and a hundred  
people, who live in fifty-five or so   
detached houses that have been built in
this now affluent area.  It is a prime 
example of a typical southern rural    
area, maintaining a country atmosphere 
while being within easy access to both 
town and city.  The peacefulness of    
the area is most acceptable to the     
older generation (retired), whose      
children may well have left for places 
of more stimulating lifestyles but for 
those who remain, Chipstead offers a   
sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of
city life, nestling in the surrounding 
farmland.  The village boasts a shop   
cum post office and an antique dealers.
