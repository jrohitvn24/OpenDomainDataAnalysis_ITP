		<content>    This  block to the  south-east of  
{Bedford }is  dominated  by the  huge  
 hangars at{Cardington}on the western  
 boundary. These were the home of the  
 ill-fated R101 but now house a newer  
 version using modern technology.      
                                       
    The  remainder  of  the  area  is  
 mainly   used  for  arable  farming,  
 although there is also some sheep.    
                                       
    There are two villages{Cardington  
{and Cople.}Cardington is still owned  
 by the Whitbread Estate which gained  
 its wealth from the brewing trade.In  
 the graveyard is the memorial to the  
 R101 victims.{Cardington}was the one  
 time  home  of  John Howard the 18th  
 century  prison reformer. It now has  
 the office of the Bedfordshire Rural  
 Community Council in the old school.
