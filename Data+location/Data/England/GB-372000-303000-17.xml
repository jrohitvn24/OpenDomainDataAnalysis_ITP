		<title>17STREAMS AND MILLS KEMBERTON</title>
		<content>  At Kemberton there was another mill. 
 The mill house is dated 1648. It is   
 thought to have been the site of an   
 18th century charcoal blast furnace.  
 Later it was used for paper making    
 then corn grinding. Operations stopped
 about 1902.                           
  Further south is Hinnington Mill     
 built in 1874. About 1889 its owner,  
 Colonel Kenyon-Slaney, installed a    
 pump to draw water from a spring to   
 fill a reservoir which served his     
 Hatton Grange Estate. The building has
 a printed sign 'Hinckesman's Spring   
 Brewery'. In the 1890s, Hinckesman,   
 who rented the mill, sold             
 reconstituted beer there. The mill is 
 now a house.                          
  In the south-east corner of the      
 parish is Grindleforge. It is known   
 that there have been a forge, a       
 slitting-mill and a paper-mill there. </content>
