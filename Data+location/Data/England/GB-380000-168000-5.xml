     There are about fifteen shops in  
{Box,}as you can see it is not a very  
 big community, most people travel to  
 the surrounding towns of{Corsham,     
{Chippenham}or{Bath}to do their        
 shopping. People  say that they would 
 like to have more shops, for they     
 waste too much petrol going to other  
 shopping centres. At the same time    
 there is a lot of personal feeling in 
 the village which does not want{Box}to
 change from a village to a small town.
