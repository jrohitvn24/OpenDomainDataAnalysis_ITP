		<content>    Peplow was listed in the original  
 Domesday book as Peplon and remained  
 as such until the end of the last     
 Century.                              
  The area comprises two villages:-    
{ Peplow and High Hatton.              
 The former is very spread out with no 
 real centre; High Hatton does have    
 a more condensed community with a     
 village centre.  Both villages are    
 predominately farming communities.    
                                       
 The only businesses in the area       
 offering employment, other than       
 farming are:-                         
 a timber-yard, a garage a black-smith 
 and Peplow Hall Estate.
