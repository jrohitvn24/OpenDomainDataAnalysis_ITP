		<title>15HISTORY OF THE AIRPORT HOTEL</title>
		<content>    The{St. George Hotel}is situated   
 within the airport grounds and is run 
 in conjunction with the airport. It   
 accommodates mainly aircrews and      
 national sales representatives usually
 only for one-night stays.             
    The Hotel is{40 years}old and the  
 outside has not changed at all in that
 time. During the 2nd World War, it was
 built as an officers' mess so the     
 walls are 25cm thick with a steel     
 plate running through the middle for  
{bomb-proofing.                        
    Today, inside, you would not       
 believe you were in the same building.
 The bedrooms are{ very modern}with    
 hair-driers, trouser-presses etc. The 
 walls are insulated from aircraft     
 noise, because of their thickness.    
    To maintain the RAF link, the      
 suites have been named after planes eg
{Spitfire}and{Hurricane}suites.        </content>
