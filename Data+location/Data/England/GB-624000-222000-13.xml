 The school was built in 1907.It       
 started off with the larger section as
 a secondary school and the smaller    
 building as a primary school.It was   
 then changed,the secondary school     
 became a primary and the primary a    
 community centre.In 1953 the school   
 was flooded and you can still see the 
 water marks on the walls.Now,in 1985, 
 as the sea defences have been         
 improved,the school is going to be    
 modernized.Part of it is going to be  
 rebuilt and the other part is just    
 going to be remodelled.
