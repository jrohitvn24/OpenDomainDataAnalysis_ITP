		<title>02Where I live (Cheshunt)</title>
		<content>    I live in a semi_detached,three    
 bedroomed house in Goffs Oak.The house
 is situated on Cuffley Hill which is a
 fairly busy road,but because we live  
 in a service road,the traffic does not
 bother us much.The recent building of 
 the M25 has cut down the number of    
 lorries along Cuffley Hill.Goffs Oak  
 is a village in the countryside of    
 Hertfordshire.It has two primary      
 schools,a library,and a recently built
 doctor's surgery.There are also two   
 churches,local shops,tennis courts,and
 a garage.There are also several farms 
 and nurseries in the village.Near the 
 shops is a war memorial which reminds 
 us of the people who were killed in   
 the war.                              
       Although Goffs Oak is a country 
 village,it can be reached by a fast   
 train from Cuffley,a neighbouring     
 village.                              </content>
