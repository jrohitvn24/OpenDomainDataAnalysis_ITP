		<title>13THE MILKMAN</title>
		<content>    Mr Butt started in his fathers     
 milk delivery business in 1934.They   
 delivered milk to the village in those
 days on a bicycle and sidecar.The     
 round would take about 4 hours.       
 Eventually they had a pony and float  
 and later still a van.                
    They had 15 cows which they milked 
 by hand .It was a 7 day week for the  
 milkmen even delivering on Christmas  
 Day.                                  
    Milk cost 2 1/2d in winter and  2d 
 in summer. Now it is 23p per pint     
 winter or summer.                     
    Our milk comes in one pint glass   
 bottles.Mr Butt used a 10 gallon churn
 and measured out as much milk as you  
 wanted with a hand can. The customer  
 supplied their own containers. Bottles
 were used at the end of the war.The   
 Butt family gave up their milk        
 business in 1949.                     </content>
