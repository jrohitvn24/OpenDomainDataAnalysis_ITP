		<title>08 Friary Grange Sports Centre</title>

   The centre is part of the Friary    
Grange School. It is situated on the   
North side of Lichfield and has        
facilities for many sports. I am in the
Lichfield swimming club and the centre 
is our home pool. The club teaches a   
range of swimmers and there are many   
galas and competitions throughout the  
year. Many of my friends use the       
gymnastics hall and the squash         
courts. At the centre you can have judo
and karate lessons, play badminton and 
table tennis and use the new fitness   
centre. During the summer holidays     
there are organised courses where you  
can improve your swimming, tennis,     
football, and badminton skills.
