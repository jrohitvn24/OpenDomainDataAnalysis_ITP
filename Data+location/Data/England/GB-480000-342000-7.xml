		<content> After lunch I raced my Dad home and   
 beat him by ten minutes although he   
 went in the car. I lit our fire in the
 fire place in the lounge. After tea I 
 typed in a program on our computer,   
 and as usual it didn't work. After    
 that I played roughball with some     
 friends.                              
 The River which runs through{Long     
{Bennington}is the{Witham.}It's not far
 away so we visit it quite often. There
 are many fish to be caught in the     
 Witham, like chub, perch, tench, eel, 
 dace, trout and roach and many more.  
 In the woods nearby ivy grows all     
 over.                                 
 Some gardens go down to the river     
 along the west bank making it         
 convenient for people owning canoes. A
 path through the fields follows the   
 east bank.                            
                                       </content>
