		<content> WE HAVE THREE CHURCHES IN OUR         
 VALLEY. ST PATRICKS, THE METHODIST,   
 AND THE ROMAN CATHOLIC. MOST OF US IN 
 OUR SCHOOL GO TO ST PATRICKS CHURCH IN
 PATTERDALE. WE MADE A MODEL OF THE    
 CHURCH AND DID A DISPLAY OF WORK      
 ABOUT THE CHURCH AND GRAVE YARD AND   
 PUT IT AS A DISPLAY AT THE BACK OF THE
 CHURCH. THE PRESENT RECTOR IN ST      
 PATRICKS CHURCH IS CALLED MR CRAWLEY. 
 THE CHURCH IS MADE FROM STONE WITH A  
 SLATE ROOF. THERE HAS BEEN A CHURCH ON
 THE PRESENT SITE FOR NEARLY 1000      
 YEARS. THE CHURCH IS DEDICATED TO THE 
 IRISH SAINT, ST PATRICK. THE CHURCH   
 YARD IS ALWAYS KEPT IN GOOD CONDITION 
 BY THE LOCALS.
