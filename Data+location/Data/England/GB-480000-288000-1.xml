This is a rural area of                
beautiful,undulating countryside       
surrounding attractive valleys built   
mainly of local stone.                 
The valleys are inhabited by a mixture 
of villagers who have lived there all  
their lives and people who live in     
Corby.There is some new development in 
each village,but mainly people have    
bought and renovated old cottages.The  
land cover is mainly arable farming of 
wheat and a lot of oil seed rape this  
year.                                  
East Carlton Hall and its Country Park 
dominate the area.This is heavily      
wooded and is being developed as a     
large recreational area for families.  
There are many splendid views over the 
rolling hunting country with small     
woods and spinneys adding to the       
richness of the landscape.             </content>
