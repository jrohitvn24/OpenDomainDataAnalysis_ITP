		<title>13LOCAL LANDMARKS</title>
		<content>{Landmarks} are important for the safe 
navigation of ships. One such landmark 
is the tower of All Saints and St.     
Margaret's {Church}, Pakefield.        
Originally half a mile inland it now   
stands on the edge of the cliff dur to 
erosion by the sea. It is some 14      
metres high. At G.R. 536 887 stands a  
derelict {lighthouse}. This was built  
in  1831 to mark the safe channel      
between sandbanks off Pakefield and    
fell into   disuse early this century. 
At G.R. 534  906 is a {water tower}. It
was built in the year 1935 to serve    
the Pakefield area. The top is 33 m.   
above sea level. Because of poor       
siting of this tower and continued     
housing development, another larger    
water tower was built at G.R. 534 906  
in 1957.  The top of this  tower is 45 
m. above sea level.
