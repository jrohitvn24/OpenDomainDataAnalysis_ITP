		<title>01Weald Farmland Nr Capel</title>
		<content> Block 05160138 is part of the Weald   
 with a fairly flat landscape covered  
 predominently by rough or intensive   
 grassland, some arable fields and     
 stretches of woodland.   Fields       
 surrounded by hedges and trees give a 
 false impression of continuous        
 woodland when viewed from above.  The 
 block is primarily farmland with a few
 living in scattered farms an cottages 
 The permeatedd by a number of public  
 footpaths and bridleways.   Apart from
 the farmers and a minority in local   
 light industry or village amenities,  
 the majority commute by bus, train of 
 car to the surrounding area, nearby   
 towns and London.  Road traffic       
 through the village has recently eased
 with compleation of a by-pass, but    
 airtraffic noise has increased due to 
 greater actiivity of aircraft from    
 Gatwick.                              </content>
