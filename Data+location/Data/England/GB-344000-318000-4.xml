    Of the people surveyed 88% had     
 their own{personal transport.}In      
 nearly all cases this was a car.      
                                       
    The Midland Red (north) Bus Company
 runs an hourly service between Bomere 
 Heath and{Shrewsbury.}Our survey found
 that 93% of the people were satisfied 
 with this service. However a small    
 number of people were disatisfied with
 the cost of fares &amp; the frequency of  
 the service. There is not a service on
 Sundays &amp; Bank Holidays, which those  
 without their own transport found     
 inconvenient.
