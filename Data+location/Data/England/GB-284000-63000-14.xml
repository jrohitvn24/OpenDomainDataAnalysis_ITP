		<content> The children of the Primary school    
 enjoy playing most of the traditional 
 games, especially at parties. There is
 however a tendency for individual and 
 playground games to be of a more      
 violent kind and to involve mock      
 fights.                               
{Party}games liked, oldest children    
 first, were "pass the parcel " and    
 "musical chairs."                     
{Playground} games were "bulldog" and  
 "cat and mouse."                      
{Outdoor} games were  a teasing,chasing
 and fighting game called "gay boy",   
 and "hide and seek."                  
{Indoor games} were fighting,"hide and 
 seek","dolls"and "snap".              
 The children like playing imaginative 
 games inspired by the latest T.V.     
 programmes or favourite films that    
 they have seen.
