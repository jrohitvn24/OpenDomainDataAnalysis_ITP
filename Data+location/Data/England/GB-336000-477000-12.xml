{DOG KENNELS AT WELL KNOWE             
  Well Knowe Kennels are owned by Miss 
 Pat Jones.  She has run the kennels   
 for 18 years.  The name Well Knowe    
 comes from the fact that there was a  
 well on the hill where the kennels    
 are.                                  
 There are at least 12 different       
 species of dog at the kennels.        
 They are fed on Pedigree Chum, raw    
 mince and biscuits. The kennels are   
 cleaned out 3 or 4 times a day and the
 dogs are exercised twice a day.       
 Miss Jones is well known at dog shows.
 She is best known for her bearded     
 collie dogs.
