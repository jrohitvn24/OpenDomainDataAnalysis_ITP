		<title>11WORK IN GREENHALGH/ROSEACRE</title>
		<content> This area has seen change in recent   
 years.  From predominantly            
 agricultural employment, we now have a
 wider source of job potential.  Due to
 improved travel facilities workers are
 able to commute from the rural areas  
 quite easily.  In close proximity we  
 have B.N.F.L. of Salwick who still    
 take quite a lot of young people for  
 apprenticeship.  B.Ae. of Warton and  
 Preston, I.C.I. at Thornton, Guardian 
 Royal Assurance at Lytham also provide
 a large proportion of the employment  
 in the area.  Seasonal jobs at        
 Blackpool fill in for students on     
 summer vacation.  A few seasonal jobs 
 are also available on the farms.      
 There is a problem with unemployment  
 for teenagers though not as bad as in 
 some areas.  Small businesses are     
 being created by some redundant       
 workers.                              </content>
