		<content> There are strong non conformist       
 roots in this area. John Wesley and   
 fellow Methodists are reputed to have 
 preached many times on Bridgeyate     
 Common. Two chapels lie in the 4 sq.km
 of our block:{Bridgeyate Methodist    
{Church, known as 'The Chapel on the   
{Common',}was built in 1810. Tiny      
 cottages then encircled the Common.   
 Recent renovation has brought the     
 church into a good state of repair. It
 has a weekly service on Sunday morning
 with an average congregation of 50;   
 also Sunday School with 30 children.  
{Oldland Gospel Hall}is a small,       
 non-denominational mission hall       
 founded 60 years ago. The average     
 congregation is 20 - mainly older     
 people. There is no provision for     
 children. It is run by local          
 elderly couple with narrow views.
