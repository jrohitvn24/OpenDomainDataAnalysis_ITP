		<content>   The school plays an active part in  
 the life of Upminster.The Charity term
 for example gives everybody in the    
 school the chance to raise money for a
 local charity and many pupils do      
 community service.  School for me     
 means a lot of hard work with some fun
 and games thrown in.                  
 Celebrations are planned to mark 450  
 years since the foundation of Coopers'
 Company School.These include giving   
 everybody a decorative plate and a    
 book of the history of the school as  
 well as a pageant.A commemorative     
 service in St.Paul's Cathederal will  
 continue the link between the school  
 and the City of London Livery         
 Companies from which the school       
 derives its name and origin.          
   The school looks forward to its     
 900th anniversary.
