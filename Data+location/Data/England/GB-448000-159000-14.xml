		<title>14Parish Church of Ecchinswell</title>
		<content>   {St.Lawrence's Church}in Ecchinswell
 was founded in 1885.The original      
 church by the river became very       
 delapidated.Funds were raised in the  
 village and a piece of land donated to
 build the church.The old church was   
 demolished and only the altar,font and
 a few tiles retained.The old graveyard
 remains.The new church is built in    
 late Gothic revival style of flint    
 with Bath stone dressing,it has a     
 wooden spire and weathercock rising to
 70feet.Built to hold 200 people,the   
 normal average congregation is 35.    
    The medieval font once had a cover 
 which was kept locked to stop witches 
 stealing the holy water.At some period
 the locks were broken and the cover   
 lost.The present cover is Victorian.  
 The vicarage was sold in 1978 when the
 United Benefice was formed.The vicar  
 today lives in a modern bungalow.     </content>
