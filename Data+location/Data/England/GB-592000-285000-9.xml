		<title>09Annual Events, Bridgham</title>
		<content> Every year, Bridgham has a bonfire on 
 November 5th.  People bring their own 
 fireworks and refreshments are        
 available.  Before Christmas, St.     
 John's Cadets call on every house in  
 the village, carol-singing, to raise  
 money for their funds - and villagers 
 are invited to The Grove for a        
 traditional carol-singing evening,    
 with mince pies and coffee.           
                                       
 At the Village Hall, there are        
 dances, dart matches, pool            
 tournaments, whist drives and bingo   
 (held in aid of village organisations)
 and entertainment evenings throughout 
 the year.  Jumble sales and fairs are 
 run by the Playing Fields Committee   
 and St. John's Cadets.  The Church    
 holds special Harvest Festival,       
 Remembrance Day, Christmas and Easter 
 services.                             </content>
