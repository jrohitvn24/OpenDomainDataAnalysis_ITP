		<content>{Mrs Dommett - a guider in Dovercourt  
 My interest in Guiding began when I   
 joined the Brownies at the age of     
 seven.I went on to join the Guides at 
 11 yrs and obtained the Queen's Guide 
 Badge at the age of 16. I became      
 interested in leadership and I was    
 made a Pack Leader of a Brownie Pack. 
  Three years ago I was asked to help  
 at a local Guide Company. After a year
 I became the Guide Leader. I now have 
 my own helper and sixteen guides. They
 range in age from ten years to        
 fifteen.                              
  Each Guide works for challenges set  
 either by themselves or by the Guider.
 After each year, if the targets have  
 been reached, they are awarded a      
 Trefoil badge. Interest badges can    
 also be gained, so that any individual
 talents or skills can be recognised by
 an award.                             </content>
