 ground, mostly fields,farmland, park &amp;
 woods.The{farms}have dairy &amp; beef     
 cattle &amp; a few sheep. Some grain is   
 grown. The{River Darent}runs through a
 large lake which belongs to Marley    
 Tile who dig sand out of it to make   
 roof tiles. It is very pleasant       
 walking by the lake as there is a lot 
 of{wild life}, Canada geese,          
 sand-martins,kingfishers,to name but a
 few. Wild plants grow freely. The     
 activities on the lake are the        
 Chipstead Sailing Club and an angling 
 club. There is also a Cheshire Home   
 for the disabled. Both Chevening &amp;    
 Dunton Green have large recreation    
 grounds with swings,slides,etc. People
 fly kites &amp; take dogs for walks. D.G. 
 has two tennis courts for hire.
