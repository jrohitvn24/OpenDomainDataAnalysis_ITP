		<title>17Foliejon Park.</title>
		<content> This{Park}obviously has a very long   
 history since it was mentioned in the 
 Domesday Book.The present large,white 
{mansion}was built in the late 18th    
 century.It stands on a hill with views
 over its{500 acres}of farmland and the
 surrounding countryside.During World  
 War II the exiled king of Norway and  
 his family lived at Foliejon.Private  
 ownership of the Park ended in 1957   
 when it was bought by{Mining and      
{Chemical Products}Ltd.Research is done
 in the old stable block but the house 
 itself is still a residence.The       
 Managing Director and his family lived
 there and many foreign visitors were  
 entertained there.Before his death in 
 1966 he and his wife redecorated and  
 refurnished the house and now it is   
 preserved because of its{architectural
{importance.}He also planted many rare 
 trees in the grounds.                 </content>
