		<title>06LIFE IN ASTON SOMERVILLE</title>
		<content> Aston Somerville, population about    
 200, is surrounded by farms but few   
 people work on the land. Most travel  
 to nearby towns their work ranging    
 from managing directors, architects   
 and the self employed. Cars are       
 essential as buses only run to Evesham
 and Cheltenham on Thursdays and       
 Saturdays. School buses are provided  
 for the children who number about 50  
 under the age of eighteen. The village
 has a play group, youth club and small
 playing field for the children. The   
 church is active in the village.      
 Social and fund raising activities are
 held in the village hall, also the    
 Womens Institute. The mobile library  
 calls fortnightly. There are darts and
 bowls teams at the licenced social    
 club. Many families enjoy gardening   
 and grow their own fruit and          
 vegetables.                           </content>
