		<title>10   FARMING AROUND LITCHAM</title>
		<content>  A typical farmer grows wheat, barley,
potatoes, beans and oil-seed rape. The 
soil he farms is light to heavy sand   
and it is moderately fertile. The soil 
compares favourably with soils in other
parts of Norfolk. The average size of  
the fields is about 30 acres.          
  The two labourers employed by the    
farmer both live locally.              
  Most of the animal food is home-grown
but pulp nuts are bought from the      
British Sugar factory as fodder for the
cattle, and some feed is bought from   
the local feed merchants.              
  Most of the farmers have tractors,   
a combine harvester, plough, seed drill
,harrow,a fertilizer spreader,baler,a  
sugarbeet harvester,potato harvester,  
trailers and rolls.
