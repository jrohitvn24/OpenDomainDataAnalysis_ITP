 The Rushall Mews old peoples home,    
 opened on the 26th October 1984, by   
 the Duke of Gloucester.  Of the four  
 suites the Kensington and Linley      
 provide long stay accommodation, the  
 Avon and Chelsea are for short stays. 
 There are also bed-sits which are     
 small self-contained homes where the  
 residents can cook, eat and sleep     
 independently.  In all rooms the Piper
 Alarm System is connected to Matron's 
 office.  Reception contains clothes,  
 toiletries and hairdressing shops.    
 Shelfield Community Clinic acts as    
 post-operative centre.  It has four   
 District Nurses, four health          
 visitors, one school nurse, two       
 midwives and one dentist with a nurse.
