		<content> The small{village}of Ashleworth,      
 ( Escelenorde in Domesday Book,meaning
 Aescel's Enclosure ) is situated on   
 the west bank of the {River}Severn    
 five miles north of Gloucester.The {  
 Church  of St.Andrew and              
 St.Bartholomew,dating from c.1100 lies
 a hundred metres  from the river      
 itself and has been the subject many  
 times to flooding.The setting is quite
 idyllic,with Ashleworth Court         
 (originally the Priory now a Farm)    
 next to the church,with a magnificent 
 tithe barn forming part of the complex
 along with the Boat Inn and cottages. 
 Within living memory there was a{ferry
 operating from the Inn at Ashleworth  
 Quay.The village lies up the hill with
 a variety of houses,some timber-framed
 and near the school on the Village    
 Green.
