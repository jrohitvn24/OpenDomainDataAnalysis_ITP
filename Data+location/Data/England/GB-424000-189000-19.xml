Watchfield Village,in the County of    
Oxfordshire,has existed from early     
times.Indeed,the 'Manor'of Watchfield  
(or Wachenesfeld as it was then known) 
belonged to the Abbot and Convent of   
Abingdon as early as the time of King  
Kenulf(an ally of King Alfred)in the   
9th century.                           
The village was enclosed,by an Act of  
Parliament,passed in 1789,when         
allotments of land were assigned to    
Lord Radnor and the Church.            
A school has existed in the village    
since 1883.The first school was closed 
in 1913;the children of the village    
then attended Shrivenham School.       
In 1963 a new school was in Watchfield.
The buildings as we know them today    
were finally completed in 1967.
