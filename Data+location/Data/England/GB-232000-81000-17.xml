		<title>17Transport in the area</title>
		<content> Launceston is quite a busy market     
 town. The main A38 bypasses the town  
 and 298 cars per hour on average use  
 the by-pass near Launceston. 151 cars 
 per hour leave or enter the town.     
 Public transport is scarce in the     
 area,but a bus service is regularly   
 used by schoolchildren.               
 Because of the lack of railway here   
 all goods have to be transported into 
 the town by lorries.The roads are     
 narrow but have been widened to take  
 the heavy goods,but much of the area  
 is covered by narrow country lanes.   
 In Lawhitton 29 were counted using the
 village's roads,this figure included  
 farm machinery.In general the state of
 the roads was very poor,with many     
 roads needing some repair.
