		<title>07THE NATIONAL STUD</title>
		<content> In 1915 Col. Hall Walker MP offered   
 his bloodstock at Tully in Ireland to 
 the British Government for the purpose
 of ounding a national stud. In 1963   
 the horse racing Betting Levy Board   
 was responsible for the operation and 
 control of the National Stud and the  
 buildings in Newmarket were opened by 
 the Queen in 1967. The day to day     
 running of the stud requires a staff  
 of about 30 and students are accepted 
 to learn stud management. The purpose 
 of the stud is for breeding top class 
 horses. The covering season starts in 
 the spring, traditionally on St       
 Valentine's day and the gestation     
 period is for 11 months. Foals are    
 normally born soon after January 1st  
 and all horses have their birthdays on
 this day. The horses train every day  
 but Sunday. The stud's offspring      
 include; Mill Reef,Grundy,Royal Palace</content>
