		<title>15Ritual Child Ear Piercing.</title>
		<content>My sister Jackie took me to towm with  
my Mum's permission to have my ears    
pierced. My Dad took my sister and me  
to town in the car. My stomach had     
butterflies and I was feeling quite    
sick. We got to Sneezum's, the shop    
where I was having my ears done but the
assistant said that they already had 5 
people waiting, so we were to go to    
their other shop down St. John's St.   
When we got there we found it only cost
1 pound 75p. I sat down in the chair.  
I held my breath. Â£CLICK.'             
"There's the first one done," she said.
"Do I have to have the next one done?" 
I thought.                             
But it was too late; she had done it.  
It stung for about an hour afterwards. 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
