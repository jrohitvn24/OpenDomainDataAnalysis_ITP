		<content> Irlam locks are on the Manchester Ship
 Canal. They were dug by navvies, which
 is short for navigators. These were   
 mostly Irish immigrants and used picks
 and shovels, not the JCB construction 
 tools we use today.                   
  When you walk past the canal it      
 smells of dirty sewage. You often     
 see things floating and the odd Tesco 
 trolley in the mud. In one corner of  
 the locks is all the floating rubbish 
 that people have thrown in and boats  
 that are moored and never move. Water 
 from the waterfall splashes on you    
 when you cross the bridge.            
  Sometimes if my mum is going to      
 Quicksave, which is over the other    
 side in Irlam, I go with her. At night
 it is calm and peaceful and you see   
 old people walking their dogs.
