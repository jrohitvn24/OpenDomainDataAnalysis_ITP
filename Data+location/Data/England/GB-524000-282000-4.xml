		<title>04THE MANOR NURSING HOME (1)</title>
		<content> The Manor House was originally built  
 in 1876.As we came down the drive we  
 saw some old machinery.We were told   
 it was used when the Manor was a      
 vicarage.As we entered we could smell 
 disinfectant.We were shown in to a    
 lounge,about eight old people were    
 resting,among them were Professor     
 Kempston, Mrs Hay,Miss Edwards.Then we
 were shown past Mrs Bell's private    
 room.We say "private" because all the 
 elderly people can bring their own    
 belongings and you have to knock      
 before you enter.Each room has a      
 colour T.V. and a telephone.To        
 complete the luxurious atmosphere,    
 there is a shop trolley and a lending 
 library that is available.
