		<content>      The area lies on the eastern edge
 of Kirklees which is one of the new   
 names which appeared on the map when  
 local government was reorganised in   
 1974. Kirklees is an area of nearly   
 160 square miles stretching from the  
 Peak District{National Park}and the   
 slopes of the South Pennines eastwards
 into the heavy woollen areas of Batley
 and Dewsbury.                         
  Our land is at its highest in the    
 SW(122m) of the rectangle, and slopes 
 down to a wide valley bottom (30m)    
 which is dominated by the River Calder
 and the Calder and Hebble Navigation  
 canal.  The land then rises to the NE 
 (80m).  The land use in the area is   
 mainly{housing}in the SW and NE       
 with{farmland}inbetween in the valley 
 bottom.  There is an extensive sewage 
 sewage works in the NW and a large    
{railway}marshaling yard in the SE.    </content>
