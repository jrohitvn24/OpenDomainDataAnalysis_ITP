		<content> We have a sports field in Brompton    
 which the Parish Council is in charge 
 of. People continually dump{garden    
{rubbish}and stones on it.             
                                       
 We have a Council rubbish tip near    
 Brompton on which it is proposed to   
 dump{asbestos}and we are concerned    
 that it might expand and become a     
 health hazard.                        
                                       
 There are two bus shelters in the     
 village and these get vandalised .    
 There is also the problem of{graffiti 
 especially in Colburn.                
                                       
 People are also concerned about{dogs  
 fouling the pavements and parks.      
                                       
 The new primary school has a{nuclear  
{alarm}in the playground which worries 
 some people.                          </content>
