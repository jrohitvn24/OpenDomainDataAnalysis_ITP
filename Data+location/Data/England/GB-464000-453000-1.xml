		<title>01DESCRIPTION OF THE LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content> The block we are covering is situated 
 just to the east of the City of York. 
 The western edge of the block borders 
 the York by-pass and the zone extends 
 across very flat land in the Vale.    
 Stockton on Forest sounds as if it is 
 a village surrounded by trees.It      
 certainly was in Norman times but     
 today most of the trees have gone and 
 apart from the houses in the village  
 the area is mostly a rich vale of     
 cereals and grassland .               
                        The farmers    
 grow mainly barley which is used for  
 cattle feed but some is sent to       
 Scotland for whisky making.           
              Tons of sugar beet are   
 grown and sent to the York Sugar      
 Beet factory every Autumn.            
                          Winter wheat 
 is another very important crop and so 
 is Oil Seed Rape.                     </content>
