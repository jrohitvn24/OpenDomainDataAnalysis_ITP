     Charing is a small and pretty     
village that is between Ashford and    
Maidstone on the A20 at the Canterbury 
road junction. The ancient Pilgrims Way
runs through Charing.                  
    Charing has many interesting things
to do and see, like the church that is 
near the ruins of the beautiful        
Archbishops Palace. Many tourists are  
attracted to the village because of its
links with the past.                   
    There are many interesting shops   
in the High Street. There is also      
a primary school and a library.        
Charing has some other interesting     
villages nearby, such as Great Chart   
and Little Chart, but Charing Heath is 
the nearest to Charing.
