		<title>16ROAD RACING ON KING'S PARADE</title>
		<content> Every so often the roads known        
 as"King's Parade"which encircle the   
 Dips are closed to normal road        
 traffic.Wooden fencing springs up     
 creating paddocks and barricades to   
 control spectators and competitors at 
 the New Brighton Road Races.          
       The roads and roundabouts are   
 edged with straw bales to protect     
 drivers who come from all over the    
 country to compete.They provide a free
 spectacular for thousands of local    
 inhabitants who gather to watch them  
 negotiating the sharp bens of a small 
 but demanding course.                 
       The normally quiet atmosphere of
 the Dips is shattered by the roar of  
 powerful engines which can also be    
 heard all over Wallasey, and the soft 
 sea air is mixed with the accrid smell
 of high octane fuel.
