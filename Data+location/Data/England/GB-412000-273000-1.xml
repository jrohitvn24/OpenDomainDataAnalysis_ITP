		<title>01GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO AREA</title>
		<content> Our Domesday area is mainly rural with
 over twenty farms within our twelve   
 kilometre square area.Most of the     
 farms have grassland cultivated for   
 cattle,pigs or horses.                
   The main residential area is the    
 village of Cheswick Green which was   
 constructed during the 1970's as the  
 'complete'village.The only other      
 residences in the area are farmhouses 
 and cottages dotted in the            
 countryside.                          
   The Stratford Canal runs through the
 area as will the new M42 motorway,at  
 present being constructed.The main    
 road within the area,until the        
 completion of the M42,is the Stratford
 Road,which runs from the centre of    
 Birmingham through to Solihull centre.
 Some old houses,like Bentley Manor and
 Drayton House,are within  this area,as
 well as St.Patrick's Vicarage.        </content>
