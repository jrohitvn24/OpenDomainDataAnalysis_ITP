		<title>10ATHERSTONE BALL GAME</title>
		<content>The origin of the game is not known,but
it seems to have started as a local    
rivalry between "Warwickshire lads and 
Leicestershire lads".A popular legend  
of the Middle Ages hints that it dated 
back to King John.This mediaeval ball- 
game on Shrove-Tuesday still survives  
today,although frowned upon by police  
and traders because of occasional      
damage and disorder.It differs from any
other game of football,for there is no 
level pitch,goalposts,Â£off side ',or   
referee.Play takes place in the main   
streets and participants are encouraged
to act in sportsmanlike manner,often   
the ball is Â£smuggled' too early.At the
start of the game the ball has many    
coloured ribbons attached which when   
handed in at the end of the game(the   
team holding the ball,at 4.30pm)and    
exchanged for money.Winning team then  
visits pubs to raise money for charity </content>
