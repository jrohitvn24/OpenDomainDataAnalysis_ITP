		<title>13A Day in the life of William</title>
		<content>   My mum wakes me up at 7:30am and I  
get out of bed and get dressed. Next I 
make my bed and comb my hair. I go down
stairs and have some breakfast. After I
have eaten my cereal and toast I go    
back up stairs and have a wash and     
clean my teeth. I then go down stairs  
and wait till 8:45am, when I go to     
school. I live next door to school so  
it does not take me long to get there. 
   When I get to school I wait for my  
friends to come and we play in the     
playground or play on the computer     
until 9:00am. When the bell  rings we  
go in and carry on with Maths or       
English, then we have an assembly. We  
then do maths until break. At break we 
usually play football and after break  
continue with English until lunch.     
   Most of the children in our school  
stay for school lunch, a few have      
sandwiches. Two dinner ladies help us. </content>
