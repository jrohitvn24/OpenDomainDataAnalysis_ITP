		<title>19AN OLD LADYS MEMORIES</title>
		<content>   WHEN WE WERE DOING OUR SURVEY WE    
 HAD TO INTERVIEW AN OLD LADY WHO WAS  
 LIVING IN AN OLD FARM HOUSE NEAR      
 BECKHAM PALACE. AFTER A FEW INITAL    
 QUESTIONS SHE SOON STARTED TALKING.   
 SHE RETIRED TO THE AREA MANY YEARS    
 AGO. HER HUSBAND DIED AND SHE LIVES   
 ALONE. HE COULD REMEMBER COMING TO    
 BECKHAM PALACE WHEN SHE WAS A GIRL,   
 SHE PROVIDED US WITH ALL OF OUR       
 INFORMATION ABOUT IT. SHE COULD       
 REMEMBER WHEN THERE WERE NO TRACTORS, 
 HORSES WERE USED FOR EVERYTHING, THE  
 TRACTORS SLOWLY APPEARED ON THE SCENE 
 AND THE JOB BECAME MUCH EASIER FOR THE
 FARMERS, BUT, AS A RESULT OF THE NEW  
 MACHINERY MANY OF THE FARM LABOURERS  
 HAD TO GO TO THE TOWNS AND CITYS FOR  
 JOBS. THIS WAS PROBABLY THE EASIEST   
 INTERVIEW THAT WE HAD TO DO.
