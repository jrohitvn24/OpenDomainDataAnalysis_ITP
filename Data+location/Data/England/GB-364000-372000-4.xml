		<content> RECREATION IN NORTHWICH IS VERY VARIED
 AND DEPENDS UPON INDIVIDUAL TASTES.IN 
 THIS BLOCK THERE ARE FACILITIES FOR   
 THE WHOLE COMMUNITY .THERE ARE PARKS, 
 PLAYING FIELDS AND PLAYGROUNDS,AS WELL
 AS MORE NATURAL AREAS ALONG RIVER     
 BANKS OR IN WOODLANDS WHERE PEOPLE CAN
 SPEND THEIR LEISURE TIME.             
 THE PRESENCE OF THE RIVER WEAVER,THE  
 RIVER DANE AND THE CANALS PROVIDE THE 
 TOWN WITH READY MADE RECREATIONAL     
 AREAS.THIS CAN BE SEEN IN THE NUMBER  
 OF WATER BASED ACTIVITIES WHICH TAKE  
 PLACE.FOR EXAMPLE,ROWING,FISHING AND  
 CANOEING ARE IMPORTANT ACTIVITIES     
 WHICH HAVE DEVELOPED AS THE WATERWAYS 
 HAVE BEEN USED LESS FOR TRADE AND MORE
 FOR RECREATION.ALSO BEING A FLAT AREA,
 THE USE OF BICYCLES IS COMMON,AND     
 CLUBS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED.THUS,IN THIS
 BLOCK,RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES REFLECT 
 THE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS WHICH EXIST.  </content>
