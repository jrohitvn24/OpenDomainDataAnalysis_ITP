		<title>13SUDELEY CASTLE - HISTORY Pt3</title>
		<content> Within three years of the Dent family 
 taking over the property it was       
 habitable again. But with the deaths  
 of the three brothers, it was left to 
 the wife of John Coucher Dent to      
 continue the work.                    
 Emma Dent supervised both internal and
 external renovations. It was Emma that
 collected manuscripts, works of art   
 and furniture. She also wrote about   
 Sudeley and Winchcombe. After her     
 death in 1900, the Castle was left to 
 her nephew, and has remained in the   
 family ever since.
