		<title>20       SHEEN TRAFFIC SURVEY</title>
		<content>  A traffic survey was carried out at  
 the junction of Upper Richmond Road   
 with Sheen Lane.                      
  Both routes are feeder roads for the 
 main commuter routes into London, the 
 South Circular and the Chertsey Road. 
 We found that the Upper Richmond Road 
 was busier, with 320 cars, 100 heavy  
 lorries and 20 buses over a 40 minute 
 period. Traffics lights were phased to
 allow for the extra traffic.          
  A lack of public carparks was        
 noticed. Waitrose, Safeways, the      
 railway station, the library and the  
 pub provided carparks only for their  
 customers. Yellow lines restricted    
 parking between 8.30 am and 6 pm on   
 the Upper Richmond Road. This leads to
 congestion, especially in Sheen Lane. 
 Pedestrians are poorly catered for,   
 with only 2 zebra crossings in a mile 
 area.                                 </content>
