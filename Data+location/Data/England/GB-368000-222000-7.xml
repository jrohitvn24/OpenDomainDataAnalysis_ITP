		<title>07THE WOMEN'S INSTITUTE.</title>
		<content>{ The Women's Institute in Aston Ingham
 was  formed  in 1921 and plays a very 
 important part in the life of the     
 village. Because of the scattered     
 nature of the cottages and farms and  
 the narrow lanes to be negotiated, the
 meetings were held in the afternoons  
 and this still holds good today.      
 However because so many more women now
 go out to work this has caused a drop 
 in numbers.                           
  Members not only enjoy their regular 
 monthly meetings but also arrange     
 additional craft sessions and outings 
 and are generally involved in the     
 catering for village functions,       
 running stalls or are otherwise       
 involved. Cliffords Mesne does not    
 have a Women's Institute and those    
 wishing to join either go to Aston    
 Ingham or to Newent.
