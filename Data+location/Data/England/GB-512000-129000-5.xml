		<content>   The{old Sewage Works}near           
 Broadbridge Farm were built in{1925.  
{10 people}were employed there to      
 control the flow of sewage which was  
 approximately{8,000 cubic metres}a    
 day. These works had to be closed in  
{January 1978}due to the large         
{increase in population}and a high risk
 of{pollution}to the nearby river.     
{31,000 people}were connected to       
 it. It is now used as a pumping       
 station for the treated sewage which  
 has been cleansed at the new treatment
 works.                                
   The{new}Sewage Works took three     
 years to construct and is made of     
 steel and concrete. Only{two people   
 are based there now. The flow through 
 the works is{14,000 cubic metres}a day
 and approximately{40,000 people       
 connected to these works.
