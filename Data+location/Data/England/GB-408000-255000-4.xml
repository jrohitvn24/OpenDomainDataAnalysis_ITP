		<content> crosses me over the main road.I walk  
 up the lane to my school.At school I  
 go down to the playground to wait for 
 the bell for assembly.We line up and  
 walk into the hall.One of the teachers
 reads a story and then we sing a      
 hymn.Then we go into our classrooms.We
 have our lessons next.I like maths    
 best.At 10.40 we have playtime for    
 twenty minutes.I play marbles or      
 run-across at playtime.Marbles are    
 round pieces of glass.At 11.00 am we  
 go in for lessons again. Then at 12.15
 we have our lunch.After lunch we have 
 a long playtime until 1.30 pm.Then we 
 have art and craft.This is my         
 favourite lesson.We have a little     
 playtime of ten minutes.
