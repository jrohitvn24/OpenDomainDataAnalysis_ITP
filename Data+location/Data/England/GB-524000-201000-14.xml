		<title>14Little Heath JMI School</title>
		<content>   The school began as a parochial     
 Church school in November 1884. It was
 financed by the Shepherd brothers from
 Leggatts Park and started in the      
 Mission Room on the present site of   
 Christ Church. The population grew    
 rapidly then as the large houses of   
 Little Heath expanded their number of 
 "service" employees.                  
   Some families can be traced right   
 through the school's history and have 
 helped to give it character and       
 identity. Music is very strong in the 
 school with guitars, recorders, choir 
 and orchestra flourishing.            
   There is a wide range of            
 extra_curricular activities and a     
 strong P.T.A.
