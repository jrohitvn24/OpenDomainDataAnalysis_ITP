 Leicester,close to Hinckley and the   
 Warwickshire border.The M69 Motorway  
 crosses the bloc and the main railway 
 line,Leicester to Birmingham touches  
 the northwest corner.Major and minor  
 roads complete the transport network. 
  The population is concentrated in    
 Burbage,a suburb of Hinckley but which
 retains an historical building core   
 dating from 1580.Aston Flamville,1\km.
 east of Burbage is a small village    
 with houses and farms along two roads 
 but no school or shop.About one third 
 of the village of Sharnford,1\km.south
 east of Aston Flamville lies in the   
 bloc.Over a dozen farms provide the   
 remaining population.                 
   Although bus services do exist,     
 personal transport is essential.Most  
 of the area is mixed farmland.Part of
