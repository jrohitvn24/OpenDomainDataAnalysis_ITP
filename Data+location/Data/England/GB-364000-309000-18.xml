		<title>18Wellington Market</title>
		<content>  The market has existed for over 60   
 years.It is open on Tuesday,Thursday  
 and Saturday.There are stalls inside  
 and outside.Many of the vendors have  
 been coming for many years.Vegetables,
 fabrics,crockery are among the many   
 items offered by some of the 100+     
 stalls.Some of the tradesmen travel   
 long distances to attend.             
 "As we walked into the hall there was 
 a smell of vegetables and fruit.The   
 market was bustling and crowded with  
 people,chatting and pushing,trying to 
 see what bargains they could find.    
 Stall_holders shouted out their cheap 
 prices.A constant noise surrounded    
 us.People came in and out of the hall.
 The stalls outside had shelters to    
 keep the stall_holders dry.People had 
 come from the surrounding towns and   
 many people making holiday visits     
 consider Wellington Market a must".   </content>
