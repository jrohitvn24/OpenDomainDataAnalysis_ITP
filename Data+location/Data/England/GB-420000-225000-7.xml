		<content>  Agriculture in this area is mixed.   
 Much of the land is wet and on the    
 springline. Many small grass paddocks 
 particularly in Oddington and         
 Maugesbury are used by people who have
 horses for hunting with the Heythrop  
 Hunt.                                 
  Sycamore Farm, Maugesbury, is an     
 owner farmed 124 hectares. 20 of these
 are on Stow Hill where there used to  
 be tanks for Maugesbury's water       
 supply. Water from the springline in  
 the fields was pumped to these tanks. 
 Sheep are farmed here and there are 80
 hectares of corn.                     
  Mount Pleasant Farm, Oddington, was  
 run until 1985 as a stock farm for    
 game birds such as pheasants. It is   
 now a corn farm.
