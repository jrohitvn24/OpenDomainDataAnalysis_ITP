PRE-SCHOOL  (a) Mother &amp; Toddler.      
This group meets on Wednesdays from    
2.00p.m. until 4.00p.m. in the Village 
Hall. While the mothers have a chance  
to chat, the toddlers play with toys   
and on equipment. In the summer they go
outside and in addition use a paddling 
pool.       (b) Play Group.            
Play Group caters for children from 2  
to 5 years of age in the Village Hall  
on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Fridays from

supervised by a qualified leader aided 
by a few mothers using equipment,      
craft, and painting materials.
