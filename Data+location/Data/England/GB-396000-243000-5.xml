 Few people realise how much the{Vale  
{of Evesham,}famous for its            
 horticultural produce and often called
 the{Garden of England,}has changed    
 over the past 30 years,farming having 
 taken over in large areas from market 
 gardening. In this area, where the    
 easily workable, light, warm soils are
 ideal for horticultural purposes,{corn
{and sugar beet}are now grown where    
 there were formerly fields of{peas,   
{runner beans, brussels sprouts,       
{cabbages, leeks etc.}Gone too are the 
{plum orchards}where the attractive    
 blossom in April attracted visitors   
 from all parts of the Midlands, and   
 bands of gypsies and travellers in    
 August, to pick the perishable short  
 season crop.
