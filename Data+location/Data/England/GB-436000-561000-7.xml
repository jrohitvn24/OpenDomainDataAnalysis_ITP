		<title>07TILESHED PIGGERY,EAST BOLDON</title>
		<content>{Tileshed Piggery}lies one mile to the 
 south of the Whiteleas council housing
 eastate near East Boldon.             
                                       
 It covers 7 acres and is owned by     
 Mr.Dixon, who has been a pig farmer   
 for 59 years. The piggery at the      
 moment has 250 animals. Mr.Dixon      
 breeds them for pork.                 
 The pigs are fed on swill and bread.  
 The swill is collected from the       
 kitchens of local schools and         
 restaurants in Sunderland. It has to  
 be heated in a special boiler to a    
 temperature of 93 degrees Celsius.    
 This kills germs in the swill and     
 prevents the pigs catching disease.   
 Mr.Dixon uses{1000 gallons}of swill a 
 day.                                  
 When the pigs weigh{110lbs (50kg)}    
 deadweight he sells them to the local 
 abbatoir.                             </content>
