		<content> Malkins Bank was originally a series  
 of canal locks and a row of bargees   
 cottages built in about 1850. the     
 middle block on the North side of the 
 canal were originally stables. The    
 only other development was larger     
 houses built by Brunner Mond for      
 factory managers in the 1900's.       
 Malkins Bank, a close knit community, 
 is changing to a retirement centre    
 which could become a suburb of        
 Sandbach. Brunner Mond, now ICI, on   
 the South side of the canal provided  
 work for many people in Malkins Bank  
 and Sandbach Heath. The railway (now  
 disused) and canal provided rapid and 
 easy transport for the factory. A     
 cardboard box factory- the only       
 remaining industry-provides a few     
 jobs.The golf course was built 8 years
 ago on the site of an old industrial  
 tip, a smelly eyesore.                </content>
