		<title>16Hall Farm, Bridgham</title>
		<content> Bridgham Hall Farm lies at the western
 end of The Street and was built in the
 early years of this century, to       
 replace the original farmhouse,       
 destroyed by fire.  Farm outbuildings 
 lie on both sides of the road, those  
 on the south side adjoining the       
 churchyard.  A special attraction are 
 the hens, Muscovy ducks and a peacock,
 which inhabit the roadside            
 outbuildings.                         
                                       
 The farm lands total 309 acres,       
 divided into 3 arable parcels and 6   
 meadows.  The arable land is cropped  
 mainly to wheat and barley, sugar beet
 and carrots.  The meadows currently   
 maintain only 62 heifers and 4        
 donkeys.  The land is not now farmed  
 independently, but forms part of the  
 lands farmed by Wrights of Brettenham 
 Manor (to the west of Bridgham).      </content>
