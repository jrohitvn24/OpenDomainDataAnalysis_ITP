		<title>20TRANSPORT IN CORBRIDGE</title>
		<content>                                       
   Most people in Corbridge travel by  
 road and since the road system in     
 Corbridge itself is based on the      
 historical pattern it leads to some   
 delays and difficulties over parking  
 particularly during the summer tourist
 season.Two major roads which used to  
 pass through the village now by-pass  
 it.They are the A68,the main north-   
 south route and the A69,the main east-
 west route.Corbridge has a good twice 
 hourly bus service which links        
 Corbridge with Newcastle,Hexham and   
 Carlisle.These towns can also be      
 reached by an hourly train service,   
 with a new diesel Pacer train being   
 introduced to the Tyne Valley in      
 October 1985.A local twice weekly bus 
 service connects Corbridge and        
 surrounding villages with Hexham on   
 market days.                          </content>
