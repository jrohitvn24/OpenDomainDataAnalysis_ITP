 QUITE EARLY AT 4 O'CLOCK AND WATCH    
 TELEVISION FOR A BIT. AFTER TEA I DO  
 MY{PIANO PRACTICE}FOR 15 MINUTES WHILE
 MUM BRINGS THE WASHING IN AND STARTS  
 IRONING. SOMETIMES I GO UPSTAIRS TO MY
 BEDROOM TO LISTEN TO MY BROTHERS      
 PLAYING THEIR RECORDS BEFORE THEY GO  
 OUT TO PLAY FOOTBALL.{DAD COMES IN    
{FROM WORK}AT ABOUT 7.40 p.m. WE HAVE  
 SUPPER TOGETHER. BY THE TIME I FINISH 
 SUPPER IT IS ABOUT 8.30 p.m.SO I GO   
 AND PUT MY NIGHTIE ON BEFORE COMING   
 DOWNSTAIRS AGAIN TO WATCH TELEVISION. 
 BETWEEN 9 AND 10 O'CLOCK{I GO TO BED  
 AND DAD MAKES ME A CUP OF OVALTINE AND
 BRINGS IT UP TO MY BEDROOM. THE REST  
 OF THE FAMILY COMES UP TO BED AFTER I 
 AM ASLEEP.
