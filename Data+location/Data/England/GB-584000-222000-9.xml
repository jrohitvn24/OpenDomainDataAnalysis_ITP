		<content>{HEALTH}In Coggeshall we are lucky to  
 have two resident Doctors,Dentists and
 Pharmacists.People in outlying        
 villages have to travel into          
 Coggeshall.The Doctor's surgery is    
 open mornings and evenings.In         
 emergency the Doctors will make home  
 visits.The District Nurse and Health  
 Visitors make rounds to check new     
 babies,the elderly and infirm.The     
 Dental Surgeries are open five days a 
 week.Doctors and Dentists have treated
 people on the National Health Service 
 since 1948.Before that only workers   
 got free medical service,everyone else
 had to pay.It costs children nothing  
 for medical and dental treatment      
 because under the National Health     
 Service if you are still at school    
 everything is free.Adults have to pay 
 a prescription charge and pay a       
 contribution from their wages.        </content>
