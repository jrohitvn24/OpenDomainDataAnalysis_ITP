		<title>02Landscape around Raveley</title>
		<content> The undulating ground of this area    
 sees the villages of Great and Little 
 Raveley and Wistow built in shallow   
 valleys, each with a small brook and  
 area of woodland.  The main view is   
 always fields, with few hedges and    
 trees.  These trees are often all that
 is marking past sites of hedges.  The 
 area is dotted with farm houses and   
 buildings, many barns are of the      
 Dutch type of metal construction, few 
 old barns built in timber and brick   
 remain. The colour of the landscape   
 changes with the seasons.  Autumn is  
 predominantely brown with ploughed and
 newly sown fields.  Spring is all     
 green with splashes of acid yellow of 
 the oilseed rape flower.  Summer, the 
 golden wheat and barley and then black
 as the straw from the harvest is      
 burnt. With a change to more ploughing
 in, stubble burning has been reduced. </content>
