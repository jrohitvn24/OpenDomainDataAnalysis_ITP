		<content>                                       
 There are ten National Parks in       
 England and Wales.The Northumberland  
 National Park was designated in       
 1956.The park provides information    
 centres,wardens,picnic areas,toilets  
 and,a more recent innovation,guided   
 walks.People are welcome to walk      
 across the whole area so long as they 
 respect the farmland and follow the   
 country code.Within this area are new 
 woods planted by the Forestry         
 Commision.Elsewhere,the Ministry of   
 Defence own large parts of the        
 area,allowing occasional access.There 
 is an information centre at           
 Ingram,which also serves as a Mountain
 Rescue Post.There used to be only one 
 full-time warden and two part-time    
 wardens in the area,now the valley is 
 served by several full-time wardens   
 one of whom lives in nearby Brandon.  </content>
