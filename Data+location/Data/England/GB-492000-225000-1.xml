		<content> To the west of the area is a high     
 density population but incorporating  
 established council housing, high     
 class housing, smaller private        
 properties and new development        
 housing. The far south west corner of 
 the area includes a small part of     
 central Leighton Buzzard with its car 
 park, commerce, fire station, council 
 offices and other public services.    
 Over half the area spans the          
 established countryside between       
 Leighton Buzzard and the surrounding  
 villages of Hockliffe, Eggington and  
 Heath and Reach. Much of this area is 
 farmland producing varied crops and   
 livestock. The area also includes a   
 number of sand quarries, an important 
 local industry, which employs the sand
 in tile making.
