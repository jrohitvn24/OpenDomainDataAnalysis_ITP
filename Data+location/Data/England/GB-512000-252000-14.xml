		<title>14High Barns Piggery.</title>
		<content> We visited the Piggery at High Barns. 
 We saw the pregnant sows which were   
 kept in separate stalls. They had     
 measured food and an open and covered 
 area. Then we saw the delivery stalls.
 There was afterbirth still there and  
 lots of piglets only hours old.       
 Piglets stayed with the sows for 14   
 days. There were straw yards where    
 'gilts' were penned.These were sold to
 other farmers to be fattened for      
 slaughter. The pigs were confined in  
 small spaces. Old sows were           
 slaughtered for sausages. Although the
 pigs seemed quite happy many pupils   
 decided to become vegetarians.
