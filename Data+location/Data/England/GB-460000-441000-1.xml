		<title>01General review of block.</title>
		<content> Our block is a rural one,in which the 
 land is mainly used for arable        
 farming.The busy A19 passes through   
 it,linking the nearby towns of York   
 and Selby.The only village contained  
 within it is Escrick,a small community
 which has fought to maintain its      
 character and which is determined not 
 to become an over-spill of either York
 or Selby.Most of the land belongs to  
 Escrick Estate.Topics we have entered 
 into our survey text include          
 leisure,sport and recreation,education
 -in both the state and independent    
 sectors,life-style,trade,employment,  
 religion,law,farming - both dairy and 
 arable,ecology,local issues,children's
 games,housing and a brief summary of  
 the role of Escrick Estate,both past  
 and present.
