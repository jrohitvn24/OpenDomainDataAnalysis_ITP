		<title>20Stanfield Water Tower</title>
		<content> Stanfield water tower is westwards    
 from Brisley school and placed by the 
 Stanfield turkey farm.We estimate the 
 tower at 20m high.                    
  The tower was opened in 1967 and the 
 water comes from Beetley bore hole on 
 the common.                           
  The tower was built in Stanfield     
 because it was in a high point and to 
 let the water flow down hill. Water is
 pumped from the bore hole in Beetley  
 and stored in the tank of the water   
 tower, it then flows by gravity to the
 houses in Beetley, Brisley,           
 Horningtoft and Stanfield.
