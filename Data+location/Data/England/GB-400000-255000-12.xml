		<title>12THE OLD BULL,INKBERROW.</title>
		<content> The{OLD BULL},is the oldest pub in    
 Inkberrow.It is in Church Street,near 
 the village green.It was black and    
 white but it has just been repainted  
 cream.The local hunt meet here and all
 the huntsmen and the hounds stop on   
 the car park while the people have a  
 drink.Afternoon teas and morning      
 coffee are served in the summer and   
 you can get bar snacks at night.There 
 are patio tables and chairs for you to
 sit outside in the sunshine.The lounge
 has just been enlarged.In the winter  
 there is a lovely log fire.           
 Inkberrow is supposed to be one of the
 villages used as a basis for the Radio
 4 programme "The Archers",and the "Old
 Bull"  is claimed to be the original  
 of the pub in Ambridge.
