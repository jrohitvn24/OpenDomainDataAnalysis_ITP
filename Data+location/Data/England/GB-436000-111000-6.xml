		<title>06My View of Millbrook Estate</title>
		<content> The estate was very dull, the houses  
 were grey stonework which didn't      
 brighten the houses up. They had a    
 youth club nearby which looked very   
 good. They had two schools which were 
 near the houses so children didn't    
 have a long walk. The council houses  
 were built in the 1960s &amp; early 1970s 
 &amp; they were beginning to crack in     
 places alredy so they don't last long.
 The people living there seemed quite  
 friendly. There were a lot of parks   
 nearby. There also seemed to be a lot 
 of waste ground but they will probably
 do something with it later. There were
 a lot of old people's homes which     
 looked very smart and tidy.           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
