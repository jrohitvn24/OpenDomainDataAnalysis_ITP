		<content> The sheep dog is not only used for    
 rounding sheep up but for sniffing the
 sheep out of the drifts of snow.      
 The sheep and cattle are sold round   
 our own area,like Bentham, Gisburn,   
 Lancaster, Hawes and Hellifield.      
 Most of the dairy cows are milked by  
 machinery.The milk is sent to the     
 creamary at Settle.There it is made   
 into cheese,butter and dried milk.Many
 of the beef cattle which live upon the
 fells are Herefords or Black Poles.In 
 the winter the dairy cows are fed on  
 hay,silo,sugar beet and cow cake.     
 A few farms in the area keep pigs,and 
 poultry.                              
 There are seven farms from which we   
 got a different acreage.The average   
 acreage is 92.The biggest farm was 260
 acres, and the smallest was 20 acres  
 only.
