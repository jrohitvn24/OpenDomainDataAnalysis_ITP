		<title>07SWIMMING  AT CAPEL SCHOOL</title>
		<content> PUPILS FROM CAPEL SCHOOL GO TO{ST.    
{JOHN'S SWIMMING POOL,}TUNBRIDGE WELLS,
 ON WEDNESDAY EACH WEEK THROUGHOUT THE 
 YEAR BY COACH. THEY ARE TAUGHT BY     
 THEIR OWN TEACHERS WHO ACCOMPANY THEM 
 TO THE BATHS. THERE ARE THREE POOLS,  
 THE LEARNER POOL, MAIN POOL AND DIVING
 POOL.CLASSES 1 AND 2 LEAVE AT 3PM AND 
 RETURN AT 5 PM.{WE HAVE THREE STAGES  
{OF PROFICIENCY}- THE PRELIMINARY FOR  
 BEGINNERS, STAGE 2 FOR BETTER SWIMMERS
 AND BRONZE, SILVER AND GOLD AWARDS FOR
 ADVANCED. I LIKE THE DIVING POOL BEST 
 AND MY OTHER FAVOURITE ACTIVITY IS    
 SWIMMING UNDER WATER. SOMETIMES WE    
 HAVE TO DO A SURFACE DIVE. EVERY YEAR 
 CAPEL SCHOOL HAS A SPONSORED SWIM TO  
 RAISE FUNDS FOLLOWED BY{A FABULOUS    
{GALA.}WE HAVE TEAM RACES AND FUN RACES
 AS WELL AS INDIVIDUAL EVENTS LIKE BACK
 STROKE, FRONT CRAWL AND BREAST STROKE.
