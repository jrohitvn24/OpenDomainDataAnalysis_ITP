		<title>01Farmland SW of Thornton Dale</title>
		<content> An area of low lying fertile farmland.
  Fairly heavy clay soil.  Part of     
 Pickering Lake following Ice Age.     
 About a dozen farms.  Fields mainly   
 long and narrow still showing effect  
 of medieval strips.  Drainage very    
 important.  Yorkshire Water Board     
 draining machines very active.  Many  
 hedges grubbed out to make larger     
 fields more suited to modern machines.
  Majority area cultivated cereals -   
 rootcrops - sugarbeet - brassilas.    
 Sheep and cattle - both stock and milk
 herds.  Large quantities of hay       
 produced for winter feed.  Majority   
 straw burnt in fields.                
                                       
 A170, main road to Scarborough, runs  
 along northern boundary but only      
 narrow farm roads in block.
