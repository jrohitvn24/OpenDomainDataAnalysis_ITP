		<title>19The New Avon Ring Road.</title>
		<content> The Ring Road will take traffic from  
 Bristol centre around the East,so     
 people can get to work quicker and    
 without getting caught in the rush    
 hour .After many meetings and protests
 the Council chose a route which will  
 cut across Hanham Hills.              
   The Ring Road will be a very busy   
 fast road.It will cost about Â£30      
 million.It will add to your mileage,  
 but will be quicker for people        
 going to work and it will take traffic
 out from Hanham.Sadly some Hanham     
 houses will have to be destroyed.     
   The road will bring new trade,jobs  
 and also bring the death of lots of   
 wildlife.It will destroy the enjoyment
 of walking dogs or recreation.        
 Farmland will be lost. Can the        
 wildlife be saved before they start   
 building?
