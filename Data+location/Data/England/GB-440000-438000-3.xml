		<content> This area is mainly covered by        
 woodland, and is known as Black Fen,  
 which belongs to the Bramham Estate.  
 The predominant trees are oak, ash,   
 beech, sycamore, silver birch, pine   
 and yew. Positioned almost centrally  
 within the wood is an obelisk, which  
 also belongs to the Bramham Estate. A 
 public footpath runs along the North  
 West boundary of the wood and there   
 are several private footpaths within  
 the wood. The few fields within this  
 area are used for crops, mainly wheat.
