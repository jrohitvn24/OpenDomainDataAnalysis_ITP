		<title>10CHURCHES IN HENFIELD.</title>
		<content> St. Peter's Sunday School, Henfield.  
   I go to St. Peter's Sunday School.  
 I think it is good because we learn   
 about God and Jesus.  We have a little
 leaflet which has a story on it.  At  
 the end of the story we have to tell  
 our teacher in what ways Jesus helps. 
 We go to the Church Service every     
 first Sunday of each month.  At       
 Christmas we do plays and perform them
 on Christmas Eve.   This is by Kim.   
 St. Peter's Church, Woodmancote.      
   The Church is quite small.  If you  
 go inside you get the real feeling of 
 a cosy place.  It is one of the       
 Churches in my Dad's Parish.  It has a
 very small Church House.  Nearby there
 is an Old People's Home for retired   
 Clergy, called Terry's Cross.  The    
 Church has one bell in a small        
 steeple.  It is an old Church which is
 built in a L-shape.   This is by Paul.</content>
