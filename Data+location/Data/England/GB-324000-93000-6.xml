		<title>06FARMING IN THE COLYTON AREA</title>
		<content> In the Colyton area, farming is one of
 the main occupations of men, women and
 children. Nowadays they use big       
 machinery like silagers for making    
 silage, combine harvesters for cutting
 corn and bailers for bailing grass    
 into bails. New technology is being   
 used for milking, rearing cattle and  
 pigs. The land is also used to grow   
 grass for silage and hay, and corn is 
 grown for animals and sometimes used  
 as seed for the next year. Cows and   
 sheep are mainly reared around this   
 area. Shiphay Farm milk cows which is 
 used to produce cheese and butter from
 the spare milk. Calves are reared     
 which are kept until they are old     
 enough to be milked. Other farms rear 
 beef cattle or pigs which are fattened
 and sold. Sheep are reared and then   
 killed for their meat, and their wool.
