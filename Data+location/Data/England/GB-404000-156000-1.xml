 Here are some of the games we play at 
 Crooks Piece. We sometimes play " 123 
 in" or rounders or British bulldog.   
 Sometimes we might play winkmurder    
 or squeezemurder which is very boring 
 because it can go on for ever and     
 ever.In rounders we always end up     
 arguing.The game" 123" is quite easy. 
 Some ones on it. On it means that one 
 person closes their eyes and counts up
 to 100 .While the person is counting  
 the other children hide.Sometimes we  
 hide behind trailers,behind straw,in  
 the barn,and in farm sheds.When they  
 have counted to 100 they start looking
 for people .If they see someone they  
 shout "One two three out" and if      
 someone gets back to base they shout  
 "One two three in".Me ,Tracy ,Alan,   
 Martin and Andrea usually chase Lesley
 Romain home.She is a bit too old for  </content>
