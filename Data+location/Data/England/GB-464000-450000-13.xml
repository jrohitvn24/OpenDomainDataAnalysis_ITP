		<title>13Housing, Dunnington/Murton</title>
		<content>   The old houses in Dunnington date   
 back to about 1750, we think, and are 
 on the two main streets. There are a  
 few more recent houses, in the same   
 old brick,which have been inserted in 
 these streets.                        
   Most of the houses in the village   
 have been built in the last twenty    
 years and are made of creamy coloured 
 or red brick, with pantile roofs.     
   Lower juniors house survey:-        
    37 of them live in detached houses,
    22  in semi-detached bungalows     
    and one in a terrace house, all    
 owner-occupied.                       
   There are 40 council houses in      
 Dunnington. There are 12 farm houses  
 in the D block.                       
  Murton has a considerable proportion 
 of older houses, with a bit of        
 in-filling, and one small estate.
