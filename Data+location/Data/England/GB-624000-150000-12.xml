		<title>12A DAY WITH THE PARKER'S CONT</title>
		<content>  Then HURRAY! it was playtime. We were
 playing "Had" and Sophie dropped her  
 peach and accidently stood on it.     
 After play we did some more of our    
 Domesday Project and began to put some
 of the work into the computer.        
  When we had washed for lunch and said
 grace we all tucked into our lunches. 
 I had peanut butter sandwiches and    
 they were horrible.                   
  After lunch a lot of us went up onto 
 the field with Mrs Corbett, our dinner
 lady, to play rounders. It was good   
 fun even though our team lost again.  
  When the bell was rung for afternoon 
 school we all trooped in and I read my
 library book for about ten minutes. As
 it was Friday Mrs Webb came in to take
 some of the class for woodwork. The   
 rest of us stayed in the classroom and
 did some observational painting
