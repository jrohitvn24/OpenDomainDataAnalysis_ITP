		<content>   {Nyetimber}was mentioned in the     
 first{Domesday Book.}In the Great Hall
 is a fireplace big enough to fit two  
 couches. The Great Hall used to be a  
 dairy.The dining room used to be the  
 kitchen. It still has the Bread Oven  
 and the paddle shaped peel for getting
 the bread out. Only one room in the   
 house has no beams or brickwork that  
 can be seen,no-one knows why. We went 
 out through the large Oak front door, 
 twice the normal size.In the courtyard
 is the grave of someone.              
{  Nyetimber Farm}has a{pig unit}with  
 24 sows,2 boars and 90 piglets. The   
 piglets take 3months 3weeks 3days to  
 be born from the time of mating. There
 are about 10 or 12 piglets in each    
 litter and 2 or 3 litters each year.  
 The pigs live in a barn over 300 years
 old. It has a steep roof so we think  
 it used to be thatched.               </content>
