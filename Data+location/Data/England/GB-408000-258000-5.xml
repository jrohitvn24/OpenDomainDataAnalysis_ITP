		<title>05Silage Making, N.Alcester</title>
		<content>     Silage is made on most farms in   
 our area. This is how it is done on   
 Coughton Cross Farm. The first thing  
 the farmer does is to cut the grass   
 with a special mower. After he has cut
 the grass he leaves it for 24 hours to
 mature. When the silage has been left,
 it is collected in a hopper. This is  
 a trailer that collects grass as it is
 pulled along. The hopper is taken back
 to the farm where all the grass is    
 gathered in a special area. When this 
 is done they use a tractor to flatten 
 it. They do this so that all  the     
 waste juice runs away. This juice is  
 dangerous to fish so the farmer has a 
 big tank for collecting it. The farmer
 puts plastic and tyres on top of      
 the grass pile and leaves it to pickle
 for 8 weeks before using it as cattle 
 fodder.
