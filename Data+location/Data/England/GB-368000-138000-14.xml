		<content>{   Mrs Nicholls}is the village{Post   
{Mistress.}She lives in the{post       
{office}with her family.               
                                       
    She has been living in{Upton Noble 
 for 27 years. When she first came here
 the{post office}was opposite the      
{school}but for the last 17 years it   
 has been opposite the{church.}        
                                       
    She has not noticed any changes    
 except for{houses}being built. This   
 she thinks is not for the better      
 because she does not want the{village 
 to change.                            
                                       
    There is no{shop}that sells{       
{groceries}in{Upton Noble.}Mrs Nichols 
 used to stock food but people now     
 prefer to travel to the{towns}to buy  
 their{shopping.
