		<content> Apart from original village there are 
 2 council estates and 3 residential   
 areas.Buildings worthy of preservation
 for age or character are{PALE FARM}and
{THE OLD FORGE}16th century listed     
 buildings both in{"The Street".}Older 
 buildings are mainly constructed of   
 Chiltern Multi-Red Stocks and flints  
 from Chiltern chalk-quarries.Facing   
 the common is{MANOR HOUSE}an elegant  
 2-storey Jacobean brick building with 
 Queen Anne facade,once lodge house to 
 Royal Palace at Kings Langley.Recent  
 development has been considerable,with
 infilling of scrubland and extensions 
 of existing dwellings.Much attention  
 is paid to ensuring that development  
 harmonises with "Green Belt" village  
 character.The character and increasing
 accessibility of London/other centres 
 produces highly inflated house prices.
