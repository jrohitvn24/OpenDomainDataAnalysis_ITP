		<content>  Houses in the block are mostly 2     
 storey and built of bricks or local   
 stone. There are a lot of large,      
 detached farmhouses. Their gardens are
 big and usually have a fence or hedge 
 surrounding them. Most houses have    
 either a single or double garage. They
 have a sitting room, dining room,     
 kitchen, bathroom and at least 2      
 bedrooms. Most houses have central    
 heating fuelled by gas or electricity.
 In the kitchen there is usually a gas 
 or electric cooker.                   
  The people who live in the block     
 would probably not work in their      
 villages unless they lived on a farm. 
 They are more likely to drive to      
 Cheltenham,Gloucester,Cirencester or  
 Swindon.
