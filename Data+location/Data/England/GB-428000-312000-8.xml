		<content>  A survey of 160 families in the      
 Donisthorpe area was conducted to find
 out how the adults were employed.     
  A high percentage of fathers worked  
 for the National Coal Board either in 
 or around Donisthorpe.Other forms of  
 employment for males varied greatly,  
 including office workers,drivers,     
 factory workers,engineers,accountants,
 salesmen etc.Very few fathers were    
 unemployed.                           
  The majority of mothers were         
 housewives.Those who were employed    
 held jobs such as factory workers,    
 cleaners,shop assistants,teachers and 
 barmaids.                             
  We noticed a lack of people working  
 in agriculture despite the rural      
 surrounding.                          
  Most people needed to travel no more 
 than 4 miles to reach their           
 employment.                           </content>
