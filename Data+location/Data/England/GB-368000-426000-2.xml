		<title>02BLACKBURN TOWN CENTRE</title>
		<content>    Blackburn town centre is very      
 large. It has many shops and banks.   
 Most of the shops are large department
 stores and clothes shops. Many shops  
 are situated in a modern precinct     
 built and owned by{LAINGS.}These shops
 range from hardware to hairdressers,  
 butchers to boutiques. Big department 
 stores like Woolworths and Debenhams  
 take up most of the space.            
    Blackburn's new Town Hall is also  
 in the precinct but the old Town Hall 
 is just outside it. Around the        
 precinct are many small shops, banks  
 and building societies. Above the     
 precinct is a multi-storey car park   
 with a capacity of{1390}cars.         
    One attraction to outsiders is {   
{Tommy Ball's}shoe market. People come 
 from all over Britain to buy cheap    
 Clarks, Kays and Italian shoes.
