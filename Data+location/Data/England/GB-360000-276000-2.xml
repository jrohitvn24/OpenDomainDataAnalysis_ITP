 The area divides into two parts, farms
 which are near the common on the hill 
 and farms in the valley.              
 The hill farms have got a few small   
 fields near the house, where they keep
 their animals in winter and make hay  
 in summer. They have the right to turn
 their sheep and cattle out to graze on
 the common land but have to obey the  
 rules of the Commoners Association.   
 These  restrict the number of animals 
 they can put on the common and ensure 
 that all the sheep are dipped at the  
 same time.                            
 The Commoners Association have        
 recently placed cattle_grids to stop  
 the stock straying. Motorists complain
 about animals causing accidents on the
 roads.
