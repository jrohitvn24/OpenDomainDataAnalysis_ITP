		<title>02Industry in Kidderminster</title>
		<content> The{carpet industry}is still the major
 employer in the town of Kidderminster.
 Most of its factories are around the  
 town centre but a number of them have 
 weaving sheds in the Oldington area of
 the town.                             
 At the turn of the century, a number  
 of attempts were made to start a{sugar
{beet}factory in Kidderminster.        
 Not until 1925, when 2700 acres of    
 beet were grown, did the sugar beet   
 factory open at Foley Park. The beet  
 slicing trade is a somewhat seasonal  
 one, so not all the labour used is    
 local. This one plant for converting  
 home-grown beet into sugar has made a 
 substantial contribution to the       
 country's supplies.
