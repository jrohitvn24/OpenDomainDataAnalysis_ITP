		<title>18A FAMILY WEEKEND 2</title>
		<content> I had to tidy my room up then which I 
 hate doing.It's the smallest bedroom  
 in the house(there are three).My older
 brother has the next biggest and then 
 Mom and Dad the largest.This is unfair
 because they only sleep in it.Our     
 house is on an estate and most of the 
 houses look the same.I don't mind too 
 much though because there is lots of  
 countryside around and the beach is   
 fairly near.                          
 I watched the 'Live-Aid' concert in   
 the afternoon.This was also seen by 1\
 billion other people and was to raise 
 money for starving people in Ethiopia.
 Went to a pub for our tea.Lovely.     
 Sunday was nice.We all went to the    
 'Pick your own' and got loads of      
 Strawberries whci we had for tea.     
 Sunday night is bath and hairwash.    
 Watched TV-a movie,went to bed and    
 read my Library book.Monday tomorrow. </content>
