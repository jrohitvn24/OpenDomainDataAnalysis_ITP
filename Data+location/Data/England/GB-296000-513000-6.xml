		<title>06SANDWITH VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Sandwith village lies on the southern 
 edge of Whitehaven and spreads along  
 either side of the road.The village is
 made up mainly of farms and           
 cottages,the oldest buildings being   
 made of irregular sandstone blocks and
 having thick tiled roofs.Many old     
 cottages have been renovated and the  
 number of farms has decreased.The     
 village has several new houses built  
 to modern design ,the most recent     
 being 4 detached houses just          
 completed.There are two pubs,The      
 Lowther Arms and the Dog and          
 Partridge.There is also a Post Office 
 on the site of a 'third' public house 
 (The White Horse) which is now a      
 private house.                        
   Dates were found on the old school  
 (1834) and a large house(1661) but    
 records suggest the village is much   
 older.                                </content>
