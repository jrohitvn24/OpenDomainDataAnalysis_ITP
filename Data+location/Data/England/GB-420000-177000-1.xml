		<title>01GENERAL REVIEW OF AREA</title>
		<content> Designated an area of outstanding     
 natural beauty, breathtaking          
 views can be enjoyed from the         
 footpaths which cross the ridge.      
 This land lies to the South/East      
 of Swindon (which provides most of    
 the facilities for the local          
 population) and is situated on a ridge
 of sloping ground which runs from     
 Swindon to Marlborough.  Consisting   
 of fields of crops or grazing         
 enclosures, the soil type is          
 predominantly chalk.  There are       
 three farms and a small group of      
 dwellings.  The general area is large 
 and open with very few hedged         
 boundaries; cattle usually being      
 enclosed by wire fencing.  Only one   
 main road runs through; unmetalled    
 tracks being the norm.  The highest   
 point at Liddington Hill is 910 ft.   
 above sea level.                      </content>
