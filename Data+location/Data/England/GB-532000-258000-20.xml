		<content> BRIDLEPATH TO BOURN. THIS IS A        
 WIDE TRACK WHICH DURING THE WINTER CAN
 BE VERY MUDDY AS IT IS USED BY        
 TRACTORS. THE FIRST PART IS ALONGSIDE 
 A PLOUGHED FIELD, THEN AFTER A SHARP  
 LEFT AND THEN RIGHT HAND TURN THE PATH
 RUNS BETWEEN TALL HEDGES.  IT         
 SLOWLYDIPS DOWN TOWARDS A CULVERT     
 AND THEN RISES AGAIN AND THE HEDGES   
 DISAPPEAR.  AT THIS POINT THERE ARE   
 MAGNIFICENT VIEWS TOWARDS BOURN AND   
 KINGSTON. THE PATH THEN DIPS DOWN     
 AGAIN TO THE SEWAGE PUMPING STATION   
 AND AT THIS POINT BECOMES A CONCRETE  
 ROAD.  IT THEN RISES AGAIN UNTIL IT   
 REACHES BOURN.                        
{PHOTOGRAPH D}IS AT THE BEGINNING OF   
 THIS BRIDLEWAY.                       
 THESE NOTES ARE MADE BY JANET         
 JOHNSON, CLERK TO PARISH COUNCIL, AND 
 CAN BE SEEN WITH DOGS ON PHOTOGRAPH D.
