		<title>04A. DRAKE, HONLEY CRICKETER</title>
		<content>{Alonzo Drake,}the {Yorkshire }left arm
 bowler of slow medium pace, spent     
 much of his life in Honley. He was    
 also a powerful left-handed batsman.  
   Drake's career in county cricket    
 spanned a period of 9 years. Apart    
 from his prowess on the field, Drake  
 won the affection of his colleagues   
 with a droll sense of humour.         
   Memories of this great cricketer    
 linger on. In 1914, at Weston, he ran 
 riot against Somerset with figures of 
 5 wickets for 16 runs and 10 wickets  
 for 35 runs. These 15 wickets were    
 taken in a mere 15.5 overs. Seven of  
 those wickets came in 20 balls. In his
 career Drake 3 times took 3 wickets in
 for balls.                            
   Alonzo died suddenly in 1919 at the 
 age of 35. He is buried in Honley     
 village.
