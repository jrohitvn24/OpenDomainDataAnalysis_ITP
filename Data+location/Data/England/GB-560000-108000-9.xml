		<content> Organised walks by Hailsham Rambling  
 Club is an area of recreation on      
 Horse-Eye Level. Though only formed in
 October 1984 it already boasts 80     
 members, who meet alternate Sundays &amp; 
 Wednesdays. Walks range from 3 - 16   
 miles &amp; are led by different members. 
 The club walks as many footpaths as   
 possible on the Ordinance Survey Map  
 to keep them open. The countryside is 
 treated with respect &amp; occasionally   
 they find a footpath overgrown, a sign
 post missing or a bridge broken. A    
 report is made to the Local Authority 
 &amp; then the club arrange a team to     
 carry out the necessary, first telling
 farmers of their intentions. Members  
 provide own refreshments eaten in a   
 pub, or a barn lent by a farmer or in 
 a hired hall. Subscriptions pay for   
 this &amp; the printing of the quarterly  
 programmes.                           </content>
