		<title>16HAYWOOD FARM</title>
		<content>        {BEFORE 1980                   
 Haywood Farm has changed a lot during 
 the 1980's. I used to live there but  
 my parents who rented it, left the    
 farm in 1980, because they could not  
 afford to buy it from the owner. We   
 interviewed{my mother}and this is what
 it was like when we left it.          
  Food had to be taken to the animals  
 and to the cow which had to be milked 
 by hand.It was hard because you had to
 clean out the animals and put down    
 clean straw.My mother Mrs Vaughan     
 enjoyed it on the farm anyway.        
  The main jobs were feeding and       
 shearing the sheep but Mrs Vaughan did
 not shear the sheep but once she did  
 by using hand shears. The sheep had to
 be dipped. Mrs Vaughan went to help   
 with the haymaking on the big farm    
 near by. The hay was put in the barn  
 for winter.                           </content>
