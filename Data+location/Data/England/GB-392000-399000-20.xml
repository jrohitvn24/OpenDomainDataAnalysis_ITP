		<title>20Knott Hill Farm.</title>
		<content>  The farm is a typical{dairy}farm on  
 the slopes below Hartshead Pike and   
 was farmed,as{tenants,}by MR. and MRS.
 Millin for 20 years from 1964 to 1984.
 During this time they have noticed an 
 increased use of machinery for milking
 and general{farming}which has improved
 efficiency enabling the farm to       
 support more cows.In 1964 the farm had
 4{cows;}in 1984 it had 30 cows each   
 giving an average of 4 or 5 gallons of
 milk per day,that is a total daily    
 yield of approximately 1200 Pints.Most
 of the milk is bottled and distributed
 via the family milk round throughout  
 Hurst;in 1964 a pint of milk cost 5p  
 compared with 23p today. Originally   
 Mr.and Mrs. Millin  were  the only    
 workers on the 28 acre farm.When they 
 left 6 people worked there and the    
 farm then occupied 50 acres;sadly the 
 old farmhouse has been vandalised.    </content>
