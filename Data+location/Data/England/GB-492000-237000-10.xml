		<title>10SOME ASPECTS OF HOME LIFE 1.</title>
		<content> Home life is of a very good standard. 
 There are no deprived or destitute    
 persons in Hulcote or Salford. Some   
 pensioners only just manage but are   
 not insecure. Most families meet at   
 breakfast which can be a cooked meal  
 or cereal with milk, fruit, tea or    
 coffee. Children of school age then go
 to school on the school bus or by car.
 Everyone  meets again for the early   
 evening meal.food preparation is      
 easier today as processed foods can be
 purchased for quickness. Many of the  
 villagers grow fruit and vegetables   
 some of which can be frozen in deep   
 freezers. There is a tendency to turn 
 to whole foods for the sake of health.
 Cooking is done by electricity, some  
 having microwave ovens.Shopping for   
 food &amp; household goods is done in     
 supermarkets several miles away. Milk 
 bread, meat &amp; fish can be delivered.  </content>
