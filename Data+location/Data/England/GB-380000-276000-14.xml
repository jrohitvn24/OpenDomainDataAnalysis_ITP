		<content> Our{Community Centre}is in the middle 
 of a council estate in Franche.  It is
 a well used building with cloakrooms, 
 toilets, a kitchen and a main hall.   
 The{Community Centre}is used for      
 activities such as Franche Boys'      
 Football Club discos which take place 
 every month.  There is a playschool   
 for children from the age of three    
 until five which meets four mornings a
 week.  The children have a bottle of  
 milk and a biscuit or two.  Kung Fu   
 takes place every Wednesday evening,  
 and there is also bingo which starts  
 at 8 o'clock and finishes at half past
 nine.  Parties for old age pensioners 
 take place here at Christmas. {Franche
{Community Centre}is very important to 
 our area because it provides us with  
 many activities.
