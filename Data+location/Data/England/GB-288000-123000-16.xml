		<content>  Refuse collections are weekly in or  
 near the village; for outlying house- 
 holds, collection is fortnightly, and 
 sometimes the pick-up point is at the 
 road end of a farm lane.Southernmost  
 households are served by N.Devon      
 District Council, the rest by West    
 Somerset Distict Council.             
  Somerset Mobile Library visits the   
 village every third week calling at   
 many farms, but not the most remote   
 ones.Devon Mobile Library calls at    
 Oakford village, not to individual    
 farms.                                
  The Local Authority is responsible   
 for Rights of Way, some being over-   
 grown from neglect and lack of use.   
 Others go through W.Nightcott Farm to 
 road from Dulverton to 12 acre Post,  
 Nutsford Bridge to Ashill and Dulv-   
 erton, from East Tapps to Highleigh
