		<content> The main trees are sycamore,beech and 
 fir.The trees were planted by the     
 Forestry Commission.The area covered  
 is 440 acres.There are other types of 
 plants;orchids,columbine,primrose     
 violet,dog daisy,bracken and other    
 plants.Whitwell Wood was part of      
 Sherwood Forest.The recently          
 discovered workings are evidence of a 
 Roman town which is the first sign of 
 life in Whitwell Wood. Whitwell wood  
 is used for timber,hedge stakes,pulp  
 and a nature reserve.The Welbeck      
 Estate owns the wood.There was a test 
 drill for the pebble 2 coal seam      
 between Whitwell Colliery and High    
 Moor Colliery.There is a well on the  
 east side and a spring on the far     
 north end.The nature group have       
 planted a coppice in the wood to give 
 local children assistance with natural
 history.                              </content>
