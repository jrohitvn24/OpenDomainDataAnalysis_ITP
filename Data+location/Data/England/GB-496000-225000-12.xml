		<content> The{majority of houses are privately  
{owned.} There are{three major types}of
 housing, detached older houses, small 
 council house estates and small       
 private housing estates.              
 Of the{older detached houses}many are 
 of historic and architectural interest
 and vary in size from large houses in 
 their own grounds to small cottages.  
 Many of the cottages have low ceilings
 and sash windows and are of{timber    
{construction}but modernisation has    
 made it difficult to determine their  
 age until you get inside. Some have   
 evidence of{window tax}in their       
 blocked up windows.                   
{The three council estates are pre war 
 and include semi-detached, terraced   
 and bungalows{with large gardens.     
 Of the private estates{Hockley Court  
 is the most recent and consists of{one
{bedroomed starter homes.              </content>
