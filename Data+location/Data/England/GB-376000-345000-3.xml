		<title>03MADELEY STAFFS : FARMING</title>
		<content> Farming is the main industry in the   
area.The soil ranges from light sandy  
to loamy clay.There is a small area of 
spoil tip reclaimed for agriculture.The
farms are mainly small,family-run dairy
units from 40-250 acres.Increased grass
production and efficiency are essential
now,because Government has forced on   
dairy farmers production limits.Since  
quotas came in,in 1983 many farmers    
find it necessary to change from large 
specialised units to a mixed system.   
Some grow barley for animal feed.Others
have found rearing sheep improves grass
production.Sheep trim grass closely    
which helps growth.Pasture &amp; managed   
grassland provide the main land cover  
with occasional areas to conserve wild 
life.Many footpaths though not visible 
are marked by stiles &amp; are widely used 
by walkers.
