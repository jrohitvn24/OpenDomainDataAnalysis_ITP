		<title>18CHANGES IN CHARLTON (2)</title>
		<content>The Village Hall that we have got at   
the moment used to be a wheelwrights.  
It was an old barn. At one time it was 
a blacksmiths shop.                    
In 1800 the chapel was built. They got 
the stone from an old field and it's   
still used now. It cost one thousand,  
three hundred and fifty pounds to be   
built. There is a person who delivers  
the milk to us and he lives across the 
road from the  Rectory.He gets his milk
from Elm Farm Dairy in Kidlington.He   
can't get it from Charlton any more    
because there are not any Dairy farms. 
At one time there was a Butchers,Sweet 
shop,Shoe shop and a slaughter house.  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
