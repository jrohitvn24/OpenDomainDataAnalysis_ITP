 at {Old Warden Lower School.}It was   
 built in 1875 under public            
 subscription.                         
  Today there are 2 classes,with only  
 35 children in the school.The         
 headmistress is Mrs.Fryatt,the 8th    
 head of the school.                   
  The children start this school at the
 age of 4+ and they leave at 9 to go to
{Robert Bloomfield Middle School}in    
 Shefford,the nearest middle school in 
 the area.                             
  On a typical day,they would start    
 with an assembly at 9 o'clock and then
 they have their lessons including     
 English,Maths,Cookery,Painting or     
 doing gym to a tape.At lunchtime in   
 summer they take their packed lunches 
 on the school field.
