		<content>     This block is an arable farming   
 area including parts of three small   
 villages. The landscape is mainly open
 with large cultivated fields and      
 occasional small woods. Some fields   
 have boundary hedges, others are      
 unfenced. The farm and village        
 buildings are a mixture of old and new
     Although most of the villagers    
 work outside the area there is a good 
 village social life with a number of  
 clubs and local events. Children      
 travel outside the area to school and 
 the local shops and traders can only  
 provide a limited range of goods and  
 services. Most villagers travel by car
 to larger towns although there are    
 some local bus services.              
     Unemployment and crime rates are  
 low. There is a mixture of social     
 classes including newcomers and old   
 established residents                 </content>
