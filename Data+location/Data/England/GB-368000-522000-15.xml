		<title>15TIMBER WORK IN FLAKEBRIDGE</title>
		<content> I am a tree feller by trade,&amp; came to 
 Flakebridge to fell some large oaks in
 June 1984,when the miners were on     
 strike.(The mines take most of the    
 wood we fell).We finished the fell in 
 6 weeks,by which time trade was really
 depressed.Much mature timber was left 
 standing.Next we were offered a scrub 
 clearance project;trees like pea rods 
 growing as thick as corn in a field.  
 This was not work we would normally   
 consider but we were glad to take     
 whatever we could.The next spring we  
 started fencing &amp; planting the cleared
 area,erecting rabbit wire round the   
 boundary.We planted 12 acres Norway   
 Spruce &amp; 6 acres of the same with one 
 sycamore in 4 added.This was about the
 most profitable job we did here.Lastly
 we thinned some softwood which took us
 to May 1985.The miners'strike was     
 ended at last.                        </content>
