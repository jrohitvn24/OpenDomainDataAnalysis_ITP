		<content>      The  parish  of  Turnditch  forms
 the  central  part of  our area,  with
 Windley,  Shottle  and  Postern ,  and
 Hulland Ward  accounting  for  most of
 the remaining area.                   
      Apart from farms, the majority of
 the housing lies adjacent to the roads
 although there is a higher density  of
 housing to be  found  in  the  centres
 represented by{Turnditch,Windley,Cross
{o' th' Hands,  Cowers Lane,  Hillcliff
{Lane and Shottlegate. }               
      The  area is generally shaped  by
 the River Ecclesbourne  valley  as  it
 emerges  from  the  foothills  of  the
 Pennines. By far the greater  part  of
 this  vicinity  is  pasture  for dairy
 cattle although there is more  by  way
 of arable farming in the river valley.
       The road pattern is fixed by the
 A517,the B5023 and the old  road  from
 Derby north through Cross o' th'Hands.</content>
