		<title>05A remarkable survival</title>
		<content>   Some years ago on Oct the 9th 1964  
 a boat, with 5 people on board, was   
 wrecked in a severe storm off St      
 Aubin's Bay.                          
                                       
   Of the several people on board, all 
 died except for{one women. }She       
 was carried around the coast for a    
 distance of many miles by the tidal   
 currents until the sea finally brought
 her to the waters below the cliffs    
 north of Vicard.  She managed to      
 struggle ashore in the little cove of 
 Petit Port after having been in the   
 water for more than 13 hours.         
                                       
   Her difficulties were not           
 over as the little cove at{Petit Port}
 is more than half a kilometre from    
{Egypt Farm. }She managed to           
 struggle up the rough path and reach  
 the farm and help.                    </content>
