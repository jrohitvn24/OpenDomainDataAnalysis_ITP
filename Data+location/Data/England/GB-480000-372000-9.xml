		<content> The village with the highest          
 population is Dunham on Trent which   
 has about l88 adults and approximately
 40 children. Newton on Trent has l55  
 adults and 40 childeen. North Clifton 
 has 118 adults and 27 children,Ragnall
 has 80 adults and 20 children, but in 
 Fledborough there are only 41 adults  
 and 15 children. There appears to be  
 an increase in the number of births,  
 but young couples do not necessarily  
 stay in the area because of lack of   
 facilities for their children and few 
 work opportunities for themselves. In 
 all five villages the majority of     
 adults over 18 vote conservative.
