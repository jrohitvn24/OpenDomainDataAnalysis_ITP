		<content>  Leisure time activities for the local
 people are very varied.  Most popular 
 were sports such as swimming, squash, 
 bowling and golf.  Gardening is also a
 very popular pastime.  Hobbies such as
 arts, crafts, reading, Do-it-Yourself 
 and television are enjoyed by many    
 people, particularly the elderly who  
 are confined to their homes.          
  Countryside hobbies are also popular.
 These include walking bird watching,  
 horse riding and angling.  Some       
 residents are members of organisations
 which encourage countryside pursuits  
 eg. Conservation Trust, Watch, Royal  
 Society for the Protection of Birds   
 and the Pony Club.                    
  The village halls provide activities 
 such as dancing and some indoor       
 sports.  For other sporting facilities
 local people have to travel to        
 surrounding towns and villages.       </content>
