		<content>     We started in the northern part of
 Messing and worked our way towards    
 Easthorpe.Several people were not     
 available to be interviewed.The people
 we did interview gave us the          
 information we needed to complete our 
 survey.The age of the houses in the   
 Messing part of our D_Block ranges    
 between thirteen and four hundred     
 and ninety one years. Also all the    
 houses in the Messing area are owned  
 by the occupants.Not many people knew 
 any history about their houses because
 most people were new tenants.One      
 house in the Messing area had quite an
 interesting history.It used to be a   
 building yard.They also had an old    
 well in their back garden.When we     
 reached Easthorpe there were  only    
 a few residents to be interviewed.    
 One of the cottages was built within  
 100 years of the Norman conquest.     </content>
