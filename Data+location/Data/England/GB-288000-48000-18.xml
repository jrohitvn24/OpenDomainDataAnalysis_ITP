		<content> We climbed up to the little fort above
 the castle,it had been built by the   
 Royalists in the Civil War,they would 
 have had a good view of the sea,the   
 mouth of the river and the town from  
 up there,but now it is thick woods.On 
 the North slope of the hill,the trees 
 are all sycamore,they are tall and    
 thin and only bluebells and brambles  
 grow under them.On the South side the 
 woods were a mixture of sycamore and  
 ash and the undergrowth is thicker.We 
 walked on towards the Coastguard      
 Cottages.The woods here are on a steep
 slope above the rivermouth,there were 
 more varieties of tree, oak,spruce,   
 beech, ash,sycamore,sweet chestnut,   
 elder and alder.We tried beating on a 
 tree with the palms of our hands,the  
 rest of us could hear still hear it at
 100 metres.
