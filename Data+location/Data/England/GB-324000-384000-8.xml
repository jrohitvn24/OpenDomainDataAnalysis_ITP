		<content>   Some school children asked a social 
 worker from Arrowe Park Hospital some 
 questions about the hospital. These   
 are some of the things they found out:
                                       
 *There are 35 wards and 850 patients. 
 *The hospital cost Â£20 million pounds 
   to build.                           
 *The plans for it were made in the    
   1960's and it opened in 1982.       
 *In case of fire, smoke detectors and 
   automatic sprinkler systems have    
   been installed.                     
 *There are 3 members of staff for each
   patient.(including cleaners etc.)   
 *Due to financial cutbacks,100 beds   
   have been lost.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
