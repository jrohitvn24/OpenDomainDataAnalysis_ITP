		<content>  THERE ARE 5 FARMS WITH LAND IN OUR 12
 KM. SQUARE,{DAIRYING}IS TYPICAL ON THE
 WET CLAY SOILS BUT INCREASINGLY CROPS 
 ARE GROWN ESPECIALLY ON THE UPLANDS   
 WHERE SOILS ARE FERTILIZED TO PRODUCE 
 QUALITY{CROPS}OF WHEAT, BARLEY AND THE
 NEWER OIL SEED RAPE (BRIGHT YELLOW    
 FIELDS IN SPRING) AND DURUM WHEAT     
 GROWN FOR PASTA. STEEPER SLOPES ARE   
 LEFT TO WOODS OR{SHEEP GRAZING.}HEDGES
 AND TREES HAVE BEEN LOST TO BIG FIELDS
 AND DUTCH ELM DISEASE. FARMERS SHOW   
 CONCERN FOR THIS BY PLANTING NEW TREES
   THE BUSIEST TIME IS JUL-AUG WHEN    
 HARVESTING IS DONE, CLOSELY FOLLOWED  
 BY PLOUGHING AND SOWING NEXT YEAR'S   
 CROPS. IN AUTUMN TOO MOST COWS HAVE   
 THEIR CALVES. JAN-MAY IS MAINLY       
 FERTILISING AND SPRAYING TO PREVENT   
 PESTS AND DISEASES. SILAGE IS CUT     
 DURING MAY-JUNE AND PUT INTO CLAMPS   
 NEXT TO THE DAIRY FOR WINTER FEED.    </content>
