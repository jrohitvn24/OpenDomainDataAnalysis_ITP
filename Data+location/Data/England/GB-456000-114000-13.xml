		<title>13HOW WE HELP OTHERS</title>
		<content> At our school we have competitions to 
 raise money for people who are less   
 fortunate than us.  We sponsor two    
 children in the Bible lands.  We need 
 to send them over Â£100 a year to send 
 them to school and to buy them        
 clothes.  The money also goes to the  
 Ethiopians to buy them food, drink and
 clothes.  At the moment we are having 
 a car washing fortnight and people may
 sponsor us.  We estimate that the     
 whole school may have raised over Â£100
 already!  The money goes to the Church
 of England Children's Society to send 
 handicapped children on holiday.  Part
 of the competition was to wash the    
 most unusual vehicle.  Some of the    
 children from our class washed H.M.S. 
 Illustrious and six children washed a 
 field gun from the D Day museum.      
 Another group washed a submarine.     
 Everyone can help.{Cara and Helen}    </content>
