It is attached to St. Edith Hall, which is now 100 years old, and was designed by G Pinkerton in 1911.&lt;br />&lt;br />Horse Riding: There are several stables fields and tracks, some for training and some for show-jumping, and some for fun.  Riding is mostly for the farmers but there is a riding school also. There are two golf courses which are well-supported. &lt;br />&lt;br />Sailing: There are facilities for sailing and windsurfing on flooded clay and gravel pits, but these are fairly expensive pastimes. &lt;br />&lt;br />Shooting: This is popular and caters for many people most of whom belong to clubs. &lt;br />&lt;br />Fishing: The lakes and flooded quarries provide managed facilities for individuals and several clubs. &lt;br />&lt;br />Wildernesse Sports Centre: Facilities for squash, tennis etc. are available to the public at evenings and weekends. There are also soccer, cricket and hockey leagues.   &lt;br /> &lt;br />
