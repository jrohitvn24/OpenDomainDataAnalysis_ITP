 HAREWOOD VILLAGE SCHOOL IS VERY OLD.  
 IT WAS BUILT IN 1848.WHEN IT WAS FIRST
 BUILT THERE WERE MORE THAN 120        
 CHILDREN ATTENDING.TODAY THERE ARE    
 ONLY 17 CHILDREN. THERE ARE TWO GROUPS
 OF CHILDREN,INFANTS AND JUNIORS.WE    
 HAVE THREE TEACHERS. WE ENJOY COMING  
 TO A SMALL VILLAGE SCHOOL BECAUSE IT  
 IS LIKE  A LARGE FAMILY AND WE ALL    
 KNOW EACH OTHER VERY WELL. OUR SCHOOL
