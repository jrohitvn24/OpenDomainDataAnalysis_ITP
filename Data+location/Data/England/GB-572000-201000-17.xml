		<title>17WATERWAYS HOWE GREEN C'FORD</title>
		<content> Forty years ago the owner, for a      
 hobby, had a pair of Carolina         
 Ducks.Now he has over 350 ducks,many  
 geese,parakeets,free flying           
 budgerigars and black swans.In fact   
 there are over 45 different species of
 birds there.Waterways was one the     
 first places in England to have a pair
 of Laysan Teal.Once there were only   
 seven in the world,now there are      
 thousands.The ducks are fed twice a   
 day on chicken food.There is a little 
 pool in each compartment for the ducks
 to bathe in.The water is pumped from a
 nearby stream.They use 3,000 gallons  
 an hour.All of the wildfowl are       
 hatched under bantams and only the    
 domestic ducks and geese are hatched  
 in incubators.
