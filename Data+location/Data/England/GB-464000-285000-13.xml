		<content> The village is amalgamated with three 
 other parishes, and the vicar lives in
 Husbands Bosworth, being the largest  
 parish. There is a service in the     
 Church each Sunday with an average    
 attendance of 16, increased to an     
 average of 50 for festivals such as   
 Christmas, Easter &amp; Harvest. The      
 village has a Sunday School which also
 meets in the Church each week with 16 
 members. There is a Congregational    
 Chapel built in 1833 which stands in a
 graveyard on the main road and still  
 in use. A visiting preacher takes     
 fortnightly services for a            
 congregation of 5. Seven people from  
 the village attend Roman Catholic     
 Churches in the area. Hothorpe Hall,  
 built 1801, is now an Anglican        
 Conference Centre &amp; is privately      
 owned. The Hall has its own Chapel    
 originally Catholic but now Anglican. </content>
