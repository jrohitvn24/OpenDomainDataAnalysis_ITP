		<title>20Transport in Witney</title>
		<content> The "Blanket Bus" has recently been   
introduced around Witney.It is a very  
useful service as Witney is getting    
bigger and there used to be very few   
buses .It is especially useful for old 
people and for people going shopping.  
It is a mini-bus and seats 16 people.  
It visits Cogges and other housing     
estates around Witney every hour and   
only costs 25pence. There are two      
vehicles and they operate six days a   
week (not on Sundays) and the last bus 
leaves Cogges at 16:40.                
 Getting to Witney from Cogges you need
to go a long way round if you drive as 
there is only one road bridge. There   
are often traffic jams along Bridge    
Street. During the day many people     
walk over the foot bridges. These are  
mostly women going shopping, young     
children and some people going to work 
Soon a new road bridge will be built.  </content>
