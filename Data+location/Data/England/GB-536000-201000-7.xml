		<content> There are two types of schools today, 
Primary and Comprehensive.             
 Children start Infants school at 4    
years of age.When they are 7 years old 
they go to Junior school.These schools 
are usually small on average 180 pupils
and half a dozen staff.They mainly     
study English and Maths.Children do not
wear uniform.                          
 When children are 11 they move on to  
Comprehensive school.These schools are 
a lot bigger with far more staff.They  
study a lot more subjects such as      
History,Geography,Music,French,German  
and Technical Studies.Pupils have an   
exam every year and when pupils are 16 
years old they do 'O' levels or        
C.S.E's.They can leave when they are 16
or  stay to study 'A' levels in the    
sixth   form.They then leave school    
when they are 18 years old.
