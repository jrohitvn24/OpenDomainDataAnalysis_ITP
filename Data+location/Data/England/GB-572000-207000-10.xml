		<title>10The Industrial Estate.</title>
		<content> Since Asda opened the Industrial area 
 has been growing but one factory ,a   
 dairy has been open since 1948.It was 
 built because all around there was    
 very good grazing land for cattle and 
 lots of water in the land for         
 sterilizing purposes.There are{15}    
 factorys so far on this site called{  
{Dukes Park Estate}.Essex county       
 council supplies,covers the largest   
 site and supplies all the county      
 councils property.The newest warehouse
 has been built ridiculasly near to the
 village.Two more warehouses are being 
 built now.All the firms are building  
 their warehouses because there is easy
 access to the coast and to{London}by  
 good roads especially since the new{  
{M25}has been opened.The Industrial    
 Estate has provided over{650 jobs}and 
 over 200 jobs have been taken by local
 people.                               </content>
