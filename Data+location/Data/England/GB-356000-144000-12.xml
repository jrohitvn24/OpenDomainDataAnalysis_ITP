		<title>12DINDER</title>
		<content> The pretty estate village of{Dinder   
 lies in the{Sheppey Valley}around the 
 two great houses:{Dinder House}(home  
 of the{Somerville}family ) and        
{Sharcombe Park.}Both houses are       
 early 19th century. The cottages are  
 of Dolomitic Conglomerate but are very
 varied in style. The church is 15th   
 century and its lych gate is dedicated
 to one of the Somerville's.           
 The great charm of Dinder is the{leat 
 which runs along the side of the      
 road in front ofthe old school and    
 school house. The village is almost   
 free of traffic as it is by_passed by 
 the main Wells to Shepton Mallet road 
 unlike the less fortunate villages of 
 Dinder and Croscombe. The{piped water 
 still comes from a private supply on  
 Maesbury. Modern trends are, however, 
 to be seen in the reduction in local  
 shops and services.                   </content>
