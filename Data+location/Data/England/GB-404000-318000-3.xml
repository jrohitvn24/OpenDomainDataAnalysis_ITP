		<title>03BUS SERVICES, RUGELEY</title>
		<content> Rugeley is served by 3 bus companies, 
 these are Midland Red (including      
 Mercian and Chaserider), Green Bus    
 Company and Stevensons Coaches.       
 Rugeley is not on the national express
 coach routes but local buses go to    
 Birmingham and other towns on national
 routes. Daytime services have a       
 frequency of about 30 minutes but     
 evening bus services are infrequent   
 and finish by 10.30 or 11.00 pm. Buses
 are cheap compared with the railway.  
 For example, an adult day return by   
 bus to Stafford is Â£1.20, by train the
 fare is nearly Â£2.00. The buses       
 themselves can be dirty and noisy and 
 are not often on time. People feel    
 uncomfortable travelling by bus       
 especially late at night because of   
 the fear of rowdy passengers. Despite 
 this there is a strong rivalry between
 the operators to provide services.    </content>
