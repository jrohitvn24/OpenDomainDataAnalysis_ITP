 Brent Knoll is the most important     
 feature in the area and the only high 
 ground.  It used to be owned privately
 but is now owned by the National      
 Trust.  It was once surrounded by     
 water and known as the Isle of Frogs. 
                                       
 Brent Knoll was once used by the      
 Romans and also in the Iron Age as a  
 fort.  The outline of the ramparts and
 defences of the fort are still clearly
 visible.                              
                                       
 Today it is used for grazing cattle   
 and sheep.  There are several         
 footpaths leading to the top.  A      
 narrow lane goes over the hill between
 East Brent and Brent Knoll.  A flag is
 flown on the top during Harvest Home  
 Celebrations.
