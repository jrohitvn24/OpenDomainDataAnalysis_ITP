		<content> We made a visit to{Greenfield Farm},  
 because it was very different,from    
 most of the other farms in the area.  
 Instead of concentrating on Cereal    
 crops,{Mr.Gross}showed us the types of
 things he grew.He said that he farmed 
 20 acres,of which 10,were rented from 
 the{council.                          
 He grows in 4 fields and sells        
 directly to the public;the things     
 grown kept him and his 8 workers busy 
 all year.They were:                   
 carrots,turnips,onions,runner-beans,le
 ttuce,beetroot,peas,sweetcorn,marrows,
 spinnage,cabbage,cauliflower,broccoli,
 and brussel sprouts.                  
 He has a hard{life-style}getting up at
 6-o-clock,working until 1-00,starting 
 again at 2.00 until 5.00.His family   
 have worked the farm since 1927,and it
 has been a farm for 150 years.the     
 vegetables we tried were lovely.      </content>
