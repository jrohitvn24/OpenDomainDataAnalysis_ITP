		<content>        Cheshire is a very flat county 
 and our area is no exception. It is   
 very fertile and makes good farmland. 
 Most of the farm areas are fenced and 
 used for grazing Friesian dairy cattle
 and some sheep. The main arable       
 produce is barley and vegetables, such
 as potatoes, carrots and cabbage. If  
 you travel down the local roads and   
 lanes you will see these for sale at  
 most of the farms and smallholdings,  
 along with free-range eggs.           
         Opposite our school is a farm 
 which used to have dairy cattle and   
 vegetables. Now the land has been     
 turned over to grazing, for another   
 farmer's dairy herd, and for          
 greenhouses. Here are grown bedding   
 plants, lettuce, tomatoes and         
 cutting-flowers. These are taken for  
 sale at the local markets at Chelford 
 and Crewe or sold to passers-by.      </content>
