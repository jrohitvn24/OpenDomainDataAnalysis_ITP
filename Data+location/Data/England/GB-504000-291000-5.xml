		<title>05NEW INVENTIONS</title>
		<content>This is about new inventions.   One new
invention is  the  computer.   Personal
computers were  introduced  about 1980.
Now in 1985 there are lots of computers
Another  new  invention  is  the  video
recorder.    You use it to record  T.V.
programmes so that you  can  watch them
later.   Now  in  1985  there are a lot
of them.                               
The  video-recorder  is also  used  for
video-games.    The video-game was made
in 1978.   Now most of the  video-games
are in arcades and pubs.   The Red Lion
in Warmington  has a  pentathlon sports
video-game.                            
On a  computer we  can do all sorts  of
things.  We can sort  data into  order.
We can look for information  and  print
it out.   We can search for words.   We
can store data  and  retrieve it, as we
are doing now on the Domesday Project.
