		<title>03EAST GRINSTEAD HIGH STREET</title>
		<content> The High St is the heart of the old   
 town, and many timber framed buildings
 in the wide market street give the    
 town great character. It is a         
 Conservation Area. The High St is     
 divided by the buildings of Middle    
 Row, itself of 14C origin. The West   
 end of the High St is a shopping      
 street with a number of retail outlets
 and service shops. The east end has a 
 different character with the north    
 side generally in commercial use while
 the south is largely residential. We  
 have 3 surviving 14C houses, albeit   
 much added to over the years. 16      
 buildings date from the period        
 1400-1540, with a further 14          
 Elizabetan or Jacobean. Little was    
 built in the 18C and the remaining    
 fine buildings are of 19 or 20C       
 origin.The old road is 7' below       
 present level due to centuries of wear</content>
