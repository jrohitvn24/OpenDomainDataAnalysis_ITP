		<title>14ST. MICHAEL'S MOUNT CUSTOMS</title>
		<content> On important occasions the castle on  
 St. Michael's Mount is{floodlit.}This 
 was done during the summer of 1977 to 
 celebrate the Silver Jubilee year of  
 Queen Elizabeth 2nd.                  
                                       
 There are many Cornish stories        
 concerning{giants.}The story of Jack  
 the Giant Killer is so well known that
 it appears in many childrens' books of
 fairy stories. There is a possibility 
 that the Mount was once the stronghold
 of a robber baron or chief who made   
 raids on Marazion and the surrounding 
 countryside, and whose exploits have  
 been exaggerated into the legends of  
 the Giant of St. Michael's Mount.     
                                       
 These Domesday entries were compiled  
 by the children of Gulval C.P. School,
 Penzance.
