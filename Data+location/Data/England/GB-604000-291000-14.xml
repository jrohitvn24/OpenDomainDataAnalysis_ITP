		<content> The schools offer some facilities,    
 including evening classes at the High 
 School, where there is also an outdoor
 swimming pool.  Both schools have     
 their own parents' associations for   
 fund-raising and social events.  There
 is an Air Training Corps, plus Scouts,
 Guides and Brownies. The political    
 parties run fund-raising and social   
 activities for members and guests.    
 There are two pubs, one of which runs 
 discos and folk nights and the other  
 gives a Christmas dinner to the old   
 people. The main event involving all  
 the village is the summer fete held on
 the first Saturday in August. Village 
 groups can have their own stall.      
 Sports are well represented in the    
 village, with teams for Football,     
 Cricket, Rugby and Womens' Hockey.
