		<title>13Cottages in Beverstone.</title>
		<content> Most of the village of Beverstone     
 straggles alongside the A.4153        
 although some other houses can be     
 found by turning off one of the side  
 roads in the village,either to the    
 left or to the right.The cottages are 
 attractive,two storey,buildings built 
 of local stone.They all have          
 well-tended gardens which are a blaze 
 of colour in the summer.Many of the   
 cottages were built in the 1840's when
 the local landowner employed Lewis    
 Vulliamy,the architect of the mansion 
 at Westonbirt,to design them.This     
 explains why many of the cottages are 
 similar,with their Gothic porches,    
 bargeboards and finials.The same sort 
 of cottages can be found in the       
 village of Westonbirt.
