		<content>{A School Day for Gemma-}I hurry into  
 School just in time for the whistle to
 blow at 8.55am.Later on the register  
 is taken and we had our spelling test.
 I got 20/20.                          
 The first lesson we had was Language  
 and in that lesson we did French.Then 
 at 10.00am we went into Maths in which
 we did percentages.                   
  10.30am was breaktime in which I had 
 a packet Salt-n-Vinegar flavoured     
 crisps.After break we had History.    
 After Dinner break it was Language and
 Maths again.Then came 2.30pm and      
 everyone packed up to go out to break.
 The teacher blew the whistle to show  
 that break was over. Silence struck   
 for 5 minutes and in walked Mrs Shand 
 our form teacher. We read for about 20
 minutes.At 3.27pm Mrs Shand told us to
 pack up to go home.
