		<title>04KENDALMANS ROAD GIGGLESWICK</title>
		<content> This road is called{Kendalmans Road   
 because it used to to be the way that 
 people went to Kendal after crossing  
 the old{ford}over the{River Ribble.   
    Before my aunties house was built  
 there in 1972 there used to be a field
 next to a barn. The flats across the  
 road used to be a{barn,}and where my  
 aunties bungalow is used to be a muck 
 midden. Next to it used to be old     
 slaughter houses and a 25 acre{meadow.
   There is now a footbridge across the
 river a bit further upstream that was 
 built in 1980. Just next to the bridge
 is a large rock known as{Queens Rock. 
 People who want to show how brave they
 are try to climb onto it. This is very
{dangerous}because the river is very   
 fast just here. If we have a lot of   
 rain the rock is sometimes covered,   
 but this does not happen too often.
