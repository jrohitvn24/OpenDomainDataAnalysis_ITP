		<title>19BENHAM VALANCE MANSION</title>
		<content> This mansion was built in 1775 for    
 Lady Craven and her husband, but a    
 computer firm, Norsk Data now own it  
 and 130 acres of parkland around it.  
 They have re-built one wing and       
 restored the rest of the house. There 
 is a linkway between the old house and
 the modern wing. They have cleared    
 some woodland for car parks and now 75
 people work there and another 70 will 
 move from their Strawberry Hill office
 to join them soon. They are employed  
 in systems integration, which means   
 testing computers before they are     
 sold. The ground floor is now a Grade 
 1 listed building and has therefore   
 been renovated in the original style. 
 It is the main U.K. Headquarters for  
 this firm which has other offices in  
 Manchester, London, and Edinburgh.
