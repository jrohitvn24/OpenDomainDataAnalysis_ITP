		<content>     To the east of Grizedale lies the 
 quiet and secluded valley of{Dale     
{Park.}This has steeply wooded sides   
 and narrow grass fields in the bottom,
 which form a part of the Graythwaite  
 Estate.                               
                                       
    Dale Park Beck, where herons are   
 frequently seen, winds its way to the 
 south to join Grizedale Beck at       
 Rusland Pool. In some places the road 
 is so narrow that cars need to pull   
 off in order to pass.                 
                                       
    There are two settlements in this  
 valley, at High Dale Park and Middle  
 Dale Park. The former relies on a     
 private water supply from springs in  
 the woods; these sometimes give out in
 prolonged periods of dry weather in   
 the summer.                           
                                       </content>
