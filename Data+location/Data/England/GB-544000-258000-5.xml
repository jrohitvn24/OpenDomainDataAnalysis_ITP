		<title>05BICYCLES IN CAMBRIDGE.</title>
		<content> ALMOST EVERYONE WHO LIVES IN{CAMBRIDGE
 OWNS A "BIKE",THEY ARE ECONOMICAL AND 
 CHEAP AND THE AREA IS VERY FLAT.      
 STUDENTS WHO COME HERE USE THEM SO    
 THERE MUST BE THOUSANDS OF THEM.      
 VISITORS DRIVING IN TOWN MUST FIND IT 
 DIFFICULT AND TEDIOUS,THE ROADS ARE   
 VERY NARROW AND MANY HAVE SPECIAL     
 CYCLE LANES.IN THE RUSH HOUR THE ROADS
 ARE CROWDED WITH BICYCLES,BUSES AND   
 CARS.                                 
 IN THE SUMMER MANY FOREIGN STUDENTS   
 ATTEND THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE SCHOOLS IN
 THE CITY AND THEY ADD TO THE CONFUSION
 BY NOT OBEYING THE HIGHWAY CODE.THEY  
 CAN BE EASILY SPOTTED ON THEIR HIRED  
 BIKES,BLUE FOR BOYS AND PINK FOR      
 GIRLS.                                
 MANY INHABITANTS OF THE CITY WOULD    
 RATHER USE THEIR BIKES THAN CARS IN   
 TOWN AS CONGESTION AND PARKING CAN BE 
 A NIGHTMARE.                          </content>
