		<title>04FARMING IN 1985</title>
		<content> Dad normally gets up at 5.45am . In   
 winter the cows stay inside because it
 is warm in their shed. There is silage
 in the shed because we put it in every
 morning using a conveyer belt with    
 the silager.  We have two silage      
 clamps to put the silage in. In winter
 Carl normally feeds the cows inside.  
 This goes on until March when we start
 silaging again. That takes us about   
 three weeks. After silaging we start  
 to hay lead. We dont get much hay     
 only about four loads, which we buy   
 from Liddles, a nearby farm.We then do
 a second cut of silage and put that in
 the second clamp. Then later on we    
 lead straw. Last year we had a lot of 
 square bales and 1,800 round bales.   
 Square bales are made using a small   
 baler and older machinery,while the   
 newest machinery makes much larger    
 round bales.                          </content>
