		<content> This block is characterised by three  
 main features:                        
 1. The village of Upwood.             
 2. The U.S.A.F. base.                 
 3. Acres of private farmland.         
                                       
   Upwood is mentioned in the Domesday 
 Book and is a combination of old and  
 new buildings. There is an old church 
 and a 17th. Century inn. It has a     
 population of 740.                    
   The new Upwood School is not in the 
 village but on the main road close to 
 what was once the R.A.F. base. When   
 the R.A.F. moved out, the school      
 numbers dropped by half. The U.S.A.F. 
 have taken the base over, and although
 there is an American school on the    
 base some of the children do come to  
 our school.
