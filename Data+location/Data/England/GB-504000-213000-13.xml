		<title>13COMMUTING</title>
		<content> Since the war &amp; the mass ownership of 
 motor vehicles Flamstead has very much
 become a dormitory suburb of London.  
 From 6.30am on weekdays there is a    
 steady stream of traffic leaving the  
 village for the journey via the M1 to 
 offices in London.To a lesser extent  
 people commute to the surrounding     
 towns,there being very little         
 employment in the immediate           
 area.Commuters travel to London in    
 various ways,car,train,bus &amp; in one   
 case bicycle.An average commuter      
 leaves home at around 7.00am, travels 
 9 miles to St.Albans where he catches 
 a train to St.Pancras.Often he then   
 takes a bus or tube to his office.This
 is rpeated in reverse in the evening  
 making the working day up to 12 hours 
 &amp; often a very unpleasant experience.
