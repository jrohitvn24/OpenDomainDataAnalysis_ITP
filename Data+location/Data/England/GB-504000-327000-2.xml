		<title>02KIRKBY UNDERWOOD VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The village of Kirkby Underwood has   
 few amenities save the Norman church  
 which stands a few hundred yards to   
 the west of the community surrouded   
 by open fields, and still used for    
 regular Sunday services albeit there  
 is no longer a resident incumbent,    
 and a village hall housed in the      
 former village primary school.        
                                       
 The traditional village green is no   
 more than a small triangle of grass,  
 recently re-kerbed, holding a basic   
 signpost at the junction of the roads 
 to Stainfield, Rippingale and Bulby.  
                                       
 In the main street will be found the  
 village post box outside the former   
 Post Office with a telephone kiosk and
 bus shelter nearby.                   
                         .... continued
