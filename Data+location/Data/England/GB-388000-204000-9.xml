		<content> Excitement in Bisley amongst gardeners
 reaches its peak on the last Saturday 
 in August.Months of careful planning  
 culminates in a final display on the  
 judges benches at the Annual Vegetable
 and Flower Show.  Founded in 1863,    
 when its was held on the beautiful    
 lawns of Lypiatt Park, it was revived 
 after the war in 1952 and now has its 
 very own field, left by a perpetual   
 trust. The large marquee is funded by 
 an annual Cider and Cheese Evening.   
 There are nine trophies and various   
 meritorious prizes to be won with     
 classes in flowers, flower arranging, 
 vegetables, jams and bottled fruit    
 cakes and wine.  Some of the keenest  
 entrants are the children who have    
 eleven different classes to enter. A  
 flower queen with her attendants and  
 pageboy is crowned at the opening of  
 the Fete in the afternoon.            </content>
