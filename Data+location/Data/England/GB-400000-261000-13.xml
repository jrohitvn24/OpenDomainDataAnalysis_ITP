		<content> VILLAGE LIFE -A PUPIL                 
   I moved to Feckenham a year ago. I  
 used to live in London. I like        
 Feckenham better. My house is now a   
 proper house but before we moved in it
 was an old barn.The sitting room used 
 to be a pig sty. There is lots of     
 wildlife in Feckenham. You see rabbits
 and foxes and there is a stream at the
 end of the garden.                    
  I go to school at Feckenham First    
 School, it is a long walk, so         
 sometimes we go in the car. My older  
 sister has to catch the coach every   
 day to go to the Middle School.       
   There is only one shop in the       
 village and it is also the Post       
 Office. On Sundays we go to Sunday    
 School. We go and play on the playing 
 fields down the road from my house.   
 The road is busy and I am not allowed 
 to go across it.                      </content>
