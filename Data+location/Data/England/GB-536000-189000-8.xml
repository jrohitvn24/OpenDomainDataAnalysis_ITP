		<content> KICKING THE BALL PAST THE GOALKEEPER. 
 THE LAST PLAYER TO SCORE A GOAL IS OUT
 OF THE GAME AND THE REST OF THE       
 PLAYERS GO THROUGH TO THE NEXT ROUND  
 UNTIL YOU HAVE ONLY TWO PLAYERS LEFT  
 AND THEY HAVE TO SCORE TWO GOALS. THE 
 WINNER IS THE ONE WHO HAS SCORED A    
 GOAL IN EVERY ROUND.  THE{DISADVANTAGE
 IS THAT{SOME CHILDREN}GET INTO A{BAD  
{TEMPER}BECAUSE THEY LOSE. THE         
{ADVANTAGE}IS THAT IT IS AN{ENJOYABLE  
 AND{SKILFUL}GAME.
