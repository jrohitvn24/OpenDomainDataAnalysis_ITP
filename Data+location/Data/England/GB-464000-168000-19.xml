		<title>19FAMILY LIFE IN BURGHFIELD</title>
		<content> Our family gets up at 7.30, except for
 Dad who gets up at 6.30 because he has
 to go to work.  When we get up, we get
 dressed and go down to breakfast.     
 Usually we have cornflakes.  After    
 breakfast John goes upstairs to play  
 with his cars and we stay downstairs  
 and draw.  We leave for school at 8.45
 and get there at 8.55, and I play     
 football.  When I get home at 3.45, I 
 watch television and Keith, Paul and  
 John play in the garden.  Then at 5.15
 we have tea.                          
 I set off for football practice at    
 5.40.  While I'm there my brothers go 
 to bed.  When I get home I have       
 something to eat and watch 'Street    
 Hawk' on television.  Then I go to    
 bed.                                  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
