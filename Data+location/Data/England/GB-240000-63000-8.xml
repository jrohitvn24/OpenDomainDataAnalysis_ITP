		<title>08River Tamar _ Wild Life</title>
		<content> The river{landscape}, with its mud    
 flats and creeks, encourages many     
 birds, including Herons, Shags, Hawks,
 Waders and Gulls; also the rare       
 Avocet. The number of Swans has       
 declined, owing to poisoning by       
 fishermen's lead weights, but attempts
 are now being made to obviate this    
 tragedy. Birds are bred in the marshes
 at Egypt Bay for the{recreation}of    
 duck shooting. In autumn, at low tide,
 Grey Squirrels cross the river from   
 Clifton to Hanging Cliff woods near   
 Hole's Hole to gather nuts and sun    
 themselves on the beach. Other{wild   
{life}includes a large selection of    
 Butterflies and Moths. Wild flowers   
 grow in abundance, including Teasels. 
 The{trade}in Narcissi for market      
 commenced at Hole's Hole, and wild    
 Narcissi still flower in the hedges   
 there.                                </content>
