		<content> Children who live in the country      
 usually go to the village school, but 
 before they are old enough to go to   
 school they go to a play group in the 
 Village Hall. Here the mothers and    
 helpers organise activities for the   
 children. This is especially important
 for children who live in isolated     
 places as they are able to meet       
 friends and learn to share.           
 Although there are lots of fields and 
 open spaces there is no special place 
 for children to play. Most of them    
 have gardens at home but as they get  
 older they would like to have a place 
 where they could play football or     
 other games.                          
 There are no organised groups like Cub
 Scouts or Brownies in the village.The 
 children who want to join these       
 organisations have to be taken to     
 another village by their parents.     </content>
