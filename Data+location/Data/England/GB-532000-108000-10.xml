		<content> In our area,there isn't much          
 entertainment,as it is a rather quiet 
 area to live in.Television is as      
 popular as ever,and is watched        
 frequently in most households,although
 annual fetes,fairs,football           
 competitions,etc.                     
                                       
 IN BRIGHTON                           
 ___________                           
     In Brighton,there is plenty of    
 enterrainment,such as the Dolphinarium
 ,the Dome(a theatre),a marina and the 
 two piers,the Palace Pier and the West
 Pier.There is also two cinemas,the ABC
 and the Odeon.Perhaps the best place  
 to go for entertainment is the        
 Brighton Centre,a large hall,with     
 seats all around;many pop stars have  
 played there.There are also several   
 amusement arcades scattered around the
 seafront area.   By Ian Codling.      </content>
