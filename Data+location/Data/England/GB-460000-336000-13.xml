		<content>    There are 44 elderly people who    
 live at{Adbolton Hall.}Most of them   
 come from the Nottingham area but some
 are from as far afield as Scotland and
 Wales. To enter, the old people either
 have to have a lot of money or be     
 unable to look after themselves and   
 need nursing most of the time. It     
 costs Â£180 a week to live there.      
 Sometimes people have to wait up to   
 six months before there is a vacancy  
 for them.                             
    Altogether there are 81 people     
 employed at Adbolton Hall including   
 the Matron, secretary, four cleaners, 
 five State Registered Nurses, three   
 cooks, two kitchen assistants, two    
 maintainance men and nursing staff.   
    The old people do not get out very 
 much but do have special celebrations 
 for birthdays and on bonfire night.
