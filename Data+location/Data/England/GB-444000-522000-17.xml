		<title>17Nuclear Dumping</title>
		<content> When a firm called NIREX wanted to    
 dump nuclear waste under Billingham a 
 meeting was held. A committee called  
 BAND (Billingham against Nuclear      
 Dumping) was formed and given an      
 office in the town centre to plan     
 events. The first was a march around  
 ICI with thousands of people joining  
 in. A petition against the proposal   
 was signed by 83 000 people. The      
 petition was handed in to the Prime   
 Minister. An answer was promised      
 before Christmas 1984 but it was      
 January 1985 before it was announced  
 that BAND had won it's fight and the  
 proposals were withdrawn.
