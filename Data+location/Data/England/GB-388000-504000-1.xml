 which consists of hilly heather       
 moorland in east.with rough grassland 
 in Weststones Dale. Sheep are grzed on
 moorland, sheep and some cattle roam  
 the grassland. Farmers use old railway
 freight vans as stores and briers, at 
 least six are in west stone dale. The 
 focal point of this and many adjacent 
 blocks is the pub. The Tan Hill Inn   
 the highest public house in britain.  
 Well frequented by tourists in cars in
 high season. During the week you will 
 find Pennine way walkers camping      
 behind the Inn. The wide range of real
 ale and impromptu folk evenings   are 
 the attractions. In august 1985 the   
 Inn was sold for Â£82500. At nearly    
 2000 feet snow is a regular hazard in 
 winter and 2mtr posts are positioned  
 along road to show direction of travel
