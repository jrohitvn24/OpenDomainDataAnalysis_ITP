		<content>  1'st Hayle Guides meet from seven-   
 thirty on Fridays.                    
  At seven-thirty guides arrive.They   
 play around until everyone is there.  
 Then it's patrol time.Patrol time is  
 when we split up into four groups     
 Daffodil,White Rose,Orchid and        
 Primrose to work or play.             
  Later on they get together in one big
 group to play games,have quizzes or   
 go for walks.                         
  At about quarter to nine they sing   
 songs till we go home.                
  Guides do many activeties like going 
 to the beach,walks or barbecues.Guides
 have many badges to earn such as      
 cooking and needlework.               
  Guides also go on camp.They camp in  
 fields or woods for weekends.         
  This year we are celebrating seventy 
 -five years of guiding.
