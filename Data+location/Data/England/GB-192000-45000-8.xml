		<title>08Tregony Police Station</title>
		<content>   There are only three policemen at   
 Tregony and two at Roseland;These     
 cover the wide Roseland area.At       
 Tregony they only have one car but can
 call for one from Truro.              
   The main crime that the police have 
 to deal with is criminal damage.There 
 are reports of people poaching from   
 farmland and private woods.The roads  
 in this D_block are very narrow and   
 windy and high hedges restrict        
 visibility.Even so so there are not   
 many serious road accidents,only minor
 incidents as people drive slowly.     
  Being a rural district they do not   
 have many serious crimes;On average   
 two per week.The land population is   
 small and they rarely have any hoax   
 calls.One of the most common calls is 
 for lost children.
