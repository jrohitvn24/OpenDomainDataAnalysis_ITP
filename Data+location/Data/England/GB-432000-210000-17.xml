		<title>17The River Windrush,Oxon.</title>
		<content>The River windrush has had several     
names.The first,in AD 779 was          
Uuenrisc,it later changed to Waenric   
in 949 AD.Then Wiruche in AD 1540,     
following the changes it became        
Windrushe in AD 1574 but is now known  
as The River Windrush.                 
                                       
The River Windrush was important in    
earlier years because of the blanket   
making industry-it provided the power  
to turn the mill wheels but it has not 
been used in that way for many years.
