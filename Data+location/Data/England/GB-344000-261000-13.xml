		<content>   At Kingsland School today we have 92
 children.  Kingsland School is a      
 primary school.  The ages in a primary
 school are between 4 and 11.  The     
 children are split into 4 classes.    
 When you leave primary school you go  
 to high school.  The high schools in  
 this area are Wigmore,Weobley and     
 Leominster.  The ages are between 11  
 and 16.  Sometimes people stay until  
 they are 18.  After high school some  
 people go to colleges or universites. 
 In Kingsland school in 1966 there were
 73 children. In 1975 there were 88 and
 in 1985 there are 92.  When Eardisland
 School closed in 1979 there were 15   
 pupils and the children and teachers  
 were transfered to Kingsland.  Now 27 
 Eardisland children attend Kingsland  
 school.  Without them the number on   
 roll at Kingsland  would have been    
 only 65.                              </content>
