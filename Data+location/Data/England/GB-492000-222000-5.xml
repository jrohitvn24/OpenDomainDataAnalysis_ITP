		<content>    Garside Sand Quarry is situated at 
 the end of Grovebury Road Industrial  
 Estate. The quarry has been operating 
 for one hundred years. It has been    
 owned by English China Clay since     
 1978.  The quarry produces 350,000    
 tones of constuction sand per year.   
 The sand is used in the manufactor of 
 concrete and roof tiles.              
    The 40,000 square metre site is    
 owned by the Church who also recieve a
 royalty of Â£0.47 per tonne.           
    The top soil and clay are removed, 
 then the sand is extracted by a       
 dredger from below the water level.   
 The sand and water is piped to        
 machinery which removes the dirt. The 
 water is then removed by a machine    
 called a hydroclone which uses        
 centrifugal force. The sand is then   
 loaded into lorries using a conveyor  
 belt and hopper.                      </content>
