		<content> A group of pupils has been working on 
 a project intended to  develop their  
 awareness of the problems associated  
 with the built environment. From this 
 they developed their own ideas  as to 
 how a neglected site within the school
 could be improved with a sculpture    
 incorporating seating and landscaping.
 The sculpture was based on the        
 familiar symbol of the mining         
 industry, the pit head wheel. The     
 final sculpture is a relief panel     
 inwhich the dynamism of the wheel has 
 been captured by the interrelation of 
 the three sets of spokes. The         
 sculpture was initially constructed   
 from wood and scrap, and was          
 strengthened and weatherproofed by    
 layers of fibre glass prior to being  
 bolted to he support wall.
