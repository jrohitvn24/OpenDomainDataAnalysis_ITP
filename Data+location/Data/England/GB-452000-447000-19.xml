		<content>  St. Mary's School in Askham Richard  
 is a Church of England primary school.
 It was built in the 1890s and         
 modernised and extended in the 1970s. 
  The school takes children from Askham
 Richard and others are brought,by car 
 or bus, from Askham Bryan.            
  In 1985 the school has thirty four   
 pupils. There are two classes:an      
 infant class for five to seven year   
 olds and a junior class for those     
 between eight and eleven years. When  
 the children leave this school they go
 to a comprehensive school in          
 Tadcaster.                            
  There is a headmistress who teaches  
 the junior class and a teacher        
 responsible for the infant class. A   
 part time teacher spends nine hours a 
 week in the school.
