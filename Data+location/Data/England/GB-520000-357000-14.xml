		<content>  Tattershall and Coningsby are a      
 combined benefice within the Lincoln  
 Diocese under Father Bernard          
 Parsons.An ordained non-stipendiary   
 priest assists him as do six lay      
 ministers. Father Bernard's role is   
 that of an 'enabler' in a teaching    
 ministry and the pastoral side of his 
 vocation hasaltered dramatically in   
 recent years as the greater mobility  
 of society in general has precluded   
 house calls on his parishioners but he
 stresses that he is often contacted   
 personally by them on social and      
 personal matters. He has close contact
 with the state run social services.   
 He has close ties with two local      
 primary schools,one of which runs a   
 weekly Christian Children's Club which
 has led to renewed enthusiasm and     
 participation in church activities    
 from youngsters in the parish.        </content>
