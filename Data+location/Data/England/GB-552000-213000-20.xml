		<title>20Games Children Play</title>
		<content> We play various games in the          
 playground including the more         
 traditional to games we make up       
 ourselves like Rebounds.  In this game
 you take it in turns to kick a ball   
 against a wall and the next person    
 must kick it on the rebound.  If you  
 miss, you are out and the last person 
 left in, is the winner.  Other games  
 we play include Chain-he and British  
 Bulldog, both games of chase and      
 capture.  Some children play quieter  
 games in the classroom, especially in 
 the winter, like chess or they might  
 use the computer.
