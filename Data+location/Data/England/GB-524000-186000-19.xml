		<title>19SAMYA BHALOO'S THURSDAY</title>
		<content> An average Thursday in my life is     
 waking up at 8.00, having breakfast at
 8.30 which is a cup of tea and toast. 
 Then I go to my neighbours house and  
 they take me to school, we reach there
 at 8.50. When we have assembly we have
 a hymn and sometimes a story. After   
 assembly we have maths, then at 10.35 
 playtime. Then until lunchtime we have
 project work. Sometimes we do science 
 or we start doing new things. Lunch-  
 time is one hour, some people bring   
 their own lunch but I have school     
 dinners. After lunch we have PE for   
 half an hour,then read the class book 
 by Jan Needle. Playtime is at 2.10    
 and then swimming. We go to Copthall  
 pool by coach. After swimming I go    
 home by bus and have a bath. After my 
 bath I either do homework or play with
 my friend Jessica. After dinner I     
 watch TV and go to sleep at 9.00pm.   </content>
