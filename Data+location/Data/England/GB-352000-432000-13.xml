		<content> BANK HALL - Now a local private       
 residence, had once a secret room used
 as a chapel in the days when Masses   
 were said in secret. It was vaguely   
 rumoured that treasure was hidden in a
 field near Bank Hall. Priests at      
 this time often hid candlesticks and  
 chalices to keep them safe.           
                                       
 BROUGHTON SCHOOL - Built 1843.        
 Children paid 3p if over 11, 2p if    
 over 8, 1p if under 8. In 1953 the    
 school was changed from all age to    
 Junior and Infant.                    
                                       
 TOLLBAR COTTAGE - Broughton. Private  
 residence. It projects into the road. 
 It was here that a moveable wooden    
 turnpike was erected. The government  
 listed the A6 a turnpike road in 1760.
