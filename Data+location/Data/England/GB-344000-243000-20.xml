		<content> In our D block there ase two primary  
 schools and three play groups. One    
 school is in Credenhill and the other 
 at Burghill. There are two play groups
 in Credenhill and one in Burghill.190 
 children attend Credenhill school and 
 36 at Burghill.There are eight        
 teachers at Credenhill and two at     
 Burghill. The children from Credenhill
 go to secondary school at Weobley and 
 those from Burghill go to Whitecross  
 school in Hereford. At Burghill school
 we do the S.M.P. maths scheme which   
 involves practical work in            
 measuring,weighing etc. We use the    
 Ginn Reading 360 scheme which is      
 brightly illustrated and has          
 interesting reading material. We do   
 project work, history, geography,     
 science, music and art. During March  
 1985 we made a long weekend visit to  
 York.                                 </content>
