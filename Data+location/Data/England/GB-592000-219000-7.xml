		<content>  Mr. Long works for{Birch Estate}and  
 lives is a cottage in an isolated part
 of Birch Park. In the{breeding season 
 he rears about 5,000 pheasant chicks. 
 About 200 stock birds are kept which  
 lay the eggs to be incubated. Four    
 breeds of pheasants and two breeds of 
 partridges are reared on the estate.  
  When the chicks are hatched they are 
 kept in warm pens and fed until they  
 are fully grown. Adult birds escape   
 into cover of the{woodland.}The       
{shooting season}begins in October and 
 goes through to February. Shoots are  
 held fortnightly in Birch in season.  
  Mr Long begins work at 5.30am most   
 mornings when he sets off on his      
 rounds of the estate to feed the      
 birds. He controls pests such as      
 rabbits, pigeons, grey squirrels and  
 moles.
