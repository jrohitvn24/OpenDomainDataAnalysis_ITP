		<content> MY PAL AND MYSELF ARE GOING TO TELL   
 YOU ABOUT FOOTBALL AND ESPECIALLY     
 ABOUT THE 'CANON' LEAGUE. HERE ARE THE
 RULES OF FOOTBALL. EACH TEAM HAS      
 ELEVEN PLAYERS AND THE PITCH MEASURES 
 BETWEEN 100M-110M LONG AND 64M-75M    
 WIDE. THE CANON LEAGUE HAS 4 DIVISIONS
 WITH 22 TEAMS IN EACH. EACH SEASON    
 EVERY TEAM IN THE LEAGUE PLAYS 42     
 GAMES.  AT THE END OF THE SEASON THE  
 TEAM IN DIVISION ONE WITH THE MOST    
 POINTS WINS THE CANON LEAGUE TROPHY.  
 NORMALLY LIVERPOOL WIN THE LEAGUE, BUT
 THIS YEAR (1985) THEIR GREAT RIVALS   
 EVERTON WON IT AND LIVERPOOL CAME     
 SECOND. THE MATCHES FOR THE CANON     
 LEAGUE TAKE PLACE BETWEEN  THE END OF 
 AUGUST AND RUN UNTIL MAY THE FOLLOWING
 YEAR.                                 
 THE TWO MAIN TROPHIES ARE THE MILK CUP
 AND THE FA CUP.
