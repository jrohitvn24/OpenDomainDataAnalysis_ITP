		<title>16NENE VALLEY STEAM CENTRE</title>
		<content>  The Nene Valley Steam Centre is a    
 major tourist attraction with its     
 large collection of old steam trains. 
 The trains run from Wansford to just  
 east of Ferry Meadows Country Park,   
 but in 1986 the railway will run right
 through Peterborough, taking people to
 the city centre.                      
  The trains at Wansford come from     
 places all over the world. The station
 employs two permanent fitters, a      
 manager and two other workers. All    
 other workers are volunteers. They    
 have tried to create an atmosphere of 
 the past in the station. One of the   
 volunteers comes from Stamford, the   
 other 2 from Peterborough. The manager
 at Wansford has been in tourism for 15
 years, 13 of which have been at Nene  
 Valley. The station's profits are     
 Â£500, all of which are donated to a   
 registered charity.                   </content>
