		<title>10 Beck Row Primary School</title>
		<content>The School,which was built in 1888,was 
an all age school with 4 rooms,one of  
which was large and served as a hall.  
In1956 2 more rooms were added with    
toilets to replace the original rather 
primitive toilet block. A Canteen and  
Kitchen were added to provide hot meals
during the 1939-45 War.                
The age range of children changed when 
Secondary children went to Mildenhall  
Riverside School.The school now caters 
for 120, 5 to 9 year old children.There
are 5 full-time teachers,1 part-time   
teacher,1 classroom ancillary,1 cook,  
1 assistant cook and one cleaner-in    
charge.The school serves a large area  
from Holywell Row to Shippea Hill.     
The building is very similar to        
St.John's Church {photographs} and is  
sometimes mistaken for a Church by     
strangers who call to enquire about    
times of Services.                     </content>
