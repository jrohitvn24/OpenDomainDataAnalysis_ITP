		<content> Farming  is the  dominant  industry in
 this area. An average farm  covers 50 
 hectares and supports a dairy herd of 
 60-80, 50-60 ewes plus followers and  
 fattening stock with a permanent work 
 force of two. The majority are run as 
 a family business and have remained in
 the family for several generations.   
 Daily work is undertaken by farmer and
 son for which purpose adequate        
 implements are maintained. Contractors
 are employed for harvest and          
 specialised tasks when large and      
 expensive equipment is needed. The    
 primary workhorse is the tractor.     
 Electricity has now reached all the   
 farms in the area and caters for      
 lighting, barn and milking machinery. 
 Milk is collected by bulk tanker for  
 home consumption. The responsible use 
 of chemicals and concern for wild life
 aids conservation                     </content>
