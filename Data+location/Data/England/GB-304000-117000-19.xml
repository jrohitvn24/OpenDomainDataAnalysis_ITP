		<title>19HOCKWORTHY</title>
		<content> Although Hockworthy is a small        
 village                               
 it is an interesting little place.    
 It has a parish church,{Saint Simon   
{and Saint Jude's}which is in the      
 middle of the village.The village has 
 recently raised 6000 pounds in order  
 to repair the church tower.Amazingly, 
 all of this money was raised in just  
 one weekend. For many years,the Vicars
 of Hockworthy were always from the    
 Newman family but now this is not so. 
                                       
 Hockworthy used to have a village     
 school which closed in 1950 when the  
 headmistress retired.As there were    
 only a few pupils at the school they  
 were transferred to Holcombe Rogus    
 School and the building was sold to   
 the village for just one pound so that
 it could be used as the Village Hall.
