		<content> Farms are very busy and also dangerous
 places because the tractors and other 
 machinery can tip up and kill the     
 driver. Most farms grow crops to feed 
 the animals.                          
 When we surveyed the land we found    
 from the 13 farms in our block, we had
 most fields of grass, and we also     
 noticed very little oats grown in     
 North Yorkshire because the soil and  
 weather do not produce a good         
 harvest. Oil Seed Rape has doubled in 
 prodution between the 1983 census and 
 this year.                            
 There are two types of rape:          
       1.Oil Seed-oil is extracted and 
 used for cooking oil, cosmetics and   
 soap.                                 
       2.Fodder _ not used for oil but 
 for animal feed.
