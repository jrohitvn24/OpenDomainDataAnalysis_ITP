Farming is very important in this      
region. The main crops are wheat, sugar
beet and oil seed rape. In Moulton     
carrots are grown for the local packing
station. Some of the fields are used   
for growing grass for sheep and cows.  
Those are the most common animals but  
there are a few pigs which are reared  
for bacon. There are not very many     
horses that pull ploughs but there are 
lots of race horses on studs. The      
fields are mostly large but they do    
have some small fields for grazing the 
horses. Just outside Moulton there is a
small field of potatoes where the land 
is lighter and easier to plough.
