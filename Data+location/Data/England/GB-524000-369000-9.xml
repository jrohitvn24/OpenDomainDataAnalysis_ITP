		<content> It is easy to reach major towns like  
 Nottingham, Hull, Sheffield and       
 Leicester. All these are between      
 1\_2hrs drive away if you use the main
 roads such as the A46 to Nottingham.  
 London is about 130 miles away. It    
 takes about an hour to reach the A1,  
 but this road takes you straight into 
 the capital.                          
    We asked people how they travelled 
 within Lincolnshire: 50% used cars,40%
 used buses which they said were       
 reasonable for the price of petrol,   
 which is Â£1.95 per gallon.            
    The Post Office delivers with one  
 trolley, three bikes and two vans. One
 big lorry comes daily from London to  
 collect the overseas and non_local    
 post. Horncastle has one telephone    
 exchange which covers five telephone  
 boxes, one with a phone card slot, and
 approximately 1555 private phones.    </content>
