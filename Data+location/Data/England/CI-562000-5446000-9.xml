		<title>09THE HARBOUR MASTER,ST.HELIER</title>
		<content>   The present Harbour Master is Mr.   
 Bullen, a position he has held for the
 past 5 years.                         
   The position of Harbour Master is   
 very old and long ago each small      
 harbour, eg. St.Aubin, had its own    
 Harbour Master but now there is just  
 one Harbour Master of Jersey. He is   
 responsible for the maintenance of all
 harbours, buoys, lighthouses, etc. He 
 also has to keep the shipping channels
 clear of wrecks.                      
   The Harbour Master has 110 people   
 working under him, including          
 painters, carpenters and office staff 
 who deal with enquiries from the      
 public and send out bills for harbour 
 dues. These are paid by ship owners   
 and travellers and help to maintain   
 the harbours. For example Â£1 of the   
 cost of a single ticket to England is 
 a Harbour due.                        </content>
