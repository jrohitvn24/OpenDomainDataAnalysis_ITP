		<content> Many schools in the county are facing 
 the problem of a marked increase in   
 vandalism. Hardly a week goes by      
 without some new damage or graffiti   
 coming to light. The police have an   
 increasing burden of school burglaries
 to deal with.                         
   At some schools the fabric of the   
 buildings is in a sad state with      
 broken windows boarded up with        
 plywood, doors smashed and graffiti on
 many walls. Inside the buildings the  
 conditions are little different, with 
 damaged fittings, leaking roofs and   
 plaster falling off the walls.        
   These poor working conditions       
 reflect perhaps the boredom of modern 
 youth and the lack of public funds to 
 keep the buildings repaired and in    
 good decorative order.
