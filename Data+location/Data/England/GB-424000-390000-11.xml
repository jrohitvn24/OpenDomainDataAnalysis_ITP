		<title>11SHEEP FARMING.</title>
		<content> A typical sheep farm in this area     
 rears about 1400 sheep on 450 acres.  
 Two recommended breeds for this type  
 of land are Swaledale &amp; Blue Face     
 Leicester.Lambing generally takes     
 place in April &amp; of course is very    
 dependant on the weather.This year,   
 because of a very poor spring &amp; summer
 the lambing has not been very good.The
 average per ewe is 1.5 lambs.Shearing 
 takes place at the end of June &amp; early
 July.It is mainly done by electric    
 shears but on one or two farms is     
 still done by hand.Fleeces are sold in
 summer &amp; the sheep in autumn.Often    
 farms are run without any outside     
 help.Since the entry of the U.K.into  
 the E.E.C.there has been a slight     
 beneficial effect in the form of      
 subsidies.
