		<title>15Present day in the shop.</title>
		<content> The shop is now run by Evelyn and     
 Marion Ascroft who are married to the 
 grandsons of the original Mr. Ascroft.
   The shop was extended in the summer 
 of 1980 when the late Mrs Ascroft also
 helped in the shop. The shop which is 
 the only general store in the Village 
 of Merebrow sells groceries, sweets,  
 tobacco, fruit and veg. Greeting cards
 mix with hardware, toys, stationery,  
 jewellery. They are agents for a      
 laundry and a cosmetic company and    
 will sell you fancy goods.            
   If you are hungry you can get hot   
 pies, sandwiches, frozen foods        
 including ice cream. Even cups of tea 
 or coffee if you ask. The shop is open
 Monday to Friday 8.45am to 5.30pm and 
 Saturday morning 8.30am to 12.30pm.
