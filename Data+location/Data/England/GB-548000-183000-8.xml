		<title>08A 7-YR-OLD'S DAY IN DAGENHAM</title>
		<content>   On Wednesdays we get our P.E.       
 clothes then we get undressed and go  
 into the hall.  We get the climbing   
 frames and benches out and jump and   
 climb and slide on them.  We have     
 Assembly where we all sit together and
 sing hymns.  At playtime we all go out
 together and play in the playground.  
 In the classroom we write stories, do 
 number work and read.                 
   Some of us stay at school for dinner
 and some go home.  In the afternoon we
 finish our work and then we can play  
 with the toys or paint.  At the end of
 the day we have a story or a song and 
 we go home at half past three.        
   At home I play with my sister and   
 have dinner.  We watch television for 
 a little while and then I go to bed.
