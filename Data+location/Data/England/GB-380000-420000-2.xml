 BULLDOG is a game where a few people  
 have to run across a field,without    
 being caught by the person on in the  
 middle.When you have been caught you  
 are on with the person in the middle. 
 The last person to be caught is on and
 the game starts again.                
 ROUNDERS has 9 people and 10 with a   
 reserve.You have 4 people which go on 
 bases,4 who field and 1 bowler.The    
 idea is to get as many rounders when  
 you hit the ball with the bat.        
 MONOPOLY is a game for 2 or players.  
 You have a token which you round the  
 board according to what the dice may  
 say.As you move round the board you   
 can buy properties.The idea of the    
 game is to have as many properties and
 money as you can.
