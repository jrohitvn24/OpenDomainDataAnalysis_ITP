		<content>    Nearly all the children in our     
 class have pets. Here are some.       
    I have a grey and white rabbit     
 called Charlie. We thought at first it
 was a buck but now we know it is a doe
 so we ought to change its name. She   
 eats dandelions and carrots.          
    I have two cats, a tom called      
 Ginger and a she called Tiddles. They 
 are both ginger and white. They sleep 
 with their heads under their paws.    
    My dog is called Spike. He is a    
 sandy haired mongrel and is two years 
 old. His favourite food is spaghetti. 
 Spike is a very good swimmer.         
    Flash is the name of my pet budgie.
 She is grey with red cheeks and       
 spotted wings. She talks, sometimes   
 saying "Who's a pretty boy?" and      
 "Hello!" She is three years old.      
    Dogs and cats are the most common  
 pets but several children have fish.  </content>
