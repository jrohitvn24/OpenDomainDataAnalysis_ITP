		<content> The small streams in the area nearly  
 all flow north-eastwards, eventually  
 emptying into Sutton Bingham reservoir
 The stream which leaves the reservoir 
 (outside this block) joins the River  
 Yeo. Some of these streams rise on the
 higher ground in the south-east and   
 centre of the area; others come from  
 outside the block, to the south. One  
 small stream in the north-west of the 
 block flows through Pendomer, event-  
 ually joining the River Parrett. The  
 impervious clay of the area makes for 
 surface drainage and much run-off;    
 where a more porous layer overlies the
 clay there are often springs at its   
 base. Halstock village, in the south  
 of the block, is more or less         
 surrounded by streams and being very  
 flat has been subject to flooding in  
 the past but this has been alleviated 
 by recent improvements in the drainage</content>
