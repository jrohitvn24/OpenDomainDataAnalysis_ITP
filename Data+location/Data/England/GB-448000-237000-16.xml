NEW BARN BUILT ON BANBURY LANE NEXT TO 
THE RAILWAY BRIDGE ON THE KINGS SUTTON 
SIDE.ON JUNE 13th 1985 "THE BANBURY    
GUARDIAN" WROTE ABOUT KINGS SUTTON'S   
PARISH COUNCIL MEETING WHEN THIS BARN  
WAS DISCUSSED.THE ENTRANCE IS CLOSE TO 
THE BRIDGE,WHICH IS ALSO ON A BEND.THE 
COUNCIL ARE WORRIED THAT BECAUSE OF    
THIS VEHICLES USING THE GATEWAY MAY BE 
A POSSIBLE DANGER TO ONCOMING TRAFFIC. 
A WARNING SIGN HAS NOW BEEN ERECTED ON
