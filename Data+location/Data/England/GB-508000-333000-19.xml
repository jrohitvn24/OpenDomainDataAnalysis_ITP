		<title>19A SCHOOLBOY'S DAY</title>
		<content>  My name is Steven Dinning and I live 
 in Billingborough, Lincolnshire.      
  On Monday I get up at 8 o'clock and  
 have my breakfast. I get on my bike   
 and ride to school. At school I play  
 football which is 22 people running   
 about kicking a round piece of leather
 filled with air trying to get it into 
 a large net called a goal.            
  At home I watch our video which is a 
 machine that plays films from a tape. 
  Saturday is my favourite day of the  
 week. I play with my friend Kevin     
 Kitchen. We go for a bike ride, then  
 play with our cars. At dinner I have  
 baked beans and something such as     
 beefburgers, bread or fried egg. After
 dinner I go out to play again until it
 is time for my tea. I like to watch   
 television before I go to bed.
