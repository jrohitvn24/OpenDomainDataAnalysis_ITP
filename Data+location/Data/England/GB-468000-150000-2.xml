		<content> I like the houses in{Mapledurwell(M)} 
 but if I had to live there I would not
 be very happy. I like the countryside 
 there but I think it would be better  
 if it was not near the motorway. It   
 seems so isolated there are no shops. 
 The houses in M are nice and I would  
 like to have a cottage but not there. 
 In M there is very limited bus service
 and very few phone boxes. To live in M
 you would need your mum and dad to    
 drive you to places,M is a long way   
 from the shops and school.There is no 
 dentist and the roads are narrow to   
 drive on.There is nothing to do in the
 evenings.                             
                                       
 I like living in{Up Nately}because it 
 is nice and quiet. It has a riding    
 school and the canal running through  
 it. It is nice living in U.N. because 
 lots of people have swimming pools.   </content>
