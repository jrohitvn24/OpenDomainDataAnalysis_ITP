		<title>14HOUSING IN RAWMARSH</title>
		<content>   On one of our Domesday visits we met
 Mrs. Hawkins who lives next to the    
 corner shop on Barber's Avenue.  She  
 has lived there since 1926 so she has 
 lived in Rawmarsh for 59 years.  She  
 told us about what Rawmarsh was like  
 many years ago.  All the houses had   
 outside toilets so old people in      
 winter would have to get all wrapped  
 up to go to the toilet.  They used to 
 have baths on legs which they stood in
 front of the fire in the front room.  
 The houses are different now, some of 
 them are being re-built.  The builders
 repair the plaster, replace doors and 
 windows and they are allowed to put   
 two new outside doors on every house. 
 The houses now have central heating.  
 They are more comfortable than they   
 were in 1926.
