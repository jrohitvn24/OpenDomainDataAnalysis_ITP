		<content> The land rises to either side of the  
 South Tyne, west to the high rough    
 fells of Ayle Common; east to the low 
 foothills of the Pennines. The haughs 
 by the river are grazed by cattle and 
 sheep; above them are mixed managed   
 forest, hayfields, rough grazing for  
 sheep, goats and cows, and finally    
 peat and heather covered grouse moors.
 There are scattered trees and copses  
 up to 350m. There are about 100       
 residents, mostly farm and            
 snallholding families, with some      
 commuters. Houses are stone, many     
 clustered in the hamlet of Ayle and   
 near the nineteenth century church by 
 the river, others scattered over the  
 hills. Barhaugh Hall is a nineteenth  
 century hunting lodge. The fells are  
 enclosed in areas of several hundred  
 acres by stone dykes, as are the      
 fields on the lower slopes.           </content>
