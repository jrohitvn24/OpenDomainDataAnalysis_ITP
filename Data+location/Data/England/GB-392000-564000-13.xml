 The Abbey was built in 1180 and it was
 burned down by Scottish tribes and    
 other people.It has been built again  
 and again.It was knocked down in about
  1200 and rebuilt shortly after,but   
 parts were not restored until 1907.The
 graveyard holds some famous people.   
 The south Transept,which was ten years
 earlier than the graveyard.It is      
 smaller but of equally fine           
 proportion.Acca's cross faces an even 
 older monument.In a blocked doorway at
 the foot of the night stairs stands a 
 roman stone from Corbridge.The Abbeys 
 clock has Roman numerals on it.The    
 clock has probably been knocked down  
 as much as the Abbey.There is a shop  
 just outside the Abbey,it sells       
 monuments ofthe Abbey,and other       
 things.
