		<title>03BUTTERLEIGH PARISH MEETING</title>
		<content>    Butterleigh is one of a few places 
 left in this country to have Parish   
 Meetings instead of a Parish Council. 
 This only happens in small villages   
 like Butterleigh.All electors can go  
 to the meetings which they have once a
 year.                                 
    They usually elect three people to 
 act for them:a{chairman;a treasurer   
 and a secretary.The chairman calls the
 meetings together and also receives   
 letters.The treasurer looks after the 
 small finances so that they are       
 presented properly to the auditor each
 year.The secretary writes letters to  
 the Mid Devon District Council for    
 example.There are no Parish rates but 
 they make money by persuading people  
 to take part in money-making events   
 like clay pigeon shooting. The money  
 is given to the Parochial Church      
 Council for spending on the village.  </content>
