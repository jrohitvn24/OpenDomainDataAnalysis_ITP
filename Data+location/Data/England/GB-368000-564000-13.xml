		<title>13Blacksmith, Haltwhistle</title>
		<content>   There has always been a blacksmith's
 shop in Haltwhistle market square. In 
 the past the blacksmiths travelled    
 around the district shoeing horses and
 repairing cartwheels. Even today many 
 farmers rely on the local blacksmith  
 to do simple repairs and were dismayed
 when the blacksmith was retiring with 
 no-one to replace him.                
   Fortunately this link with the past 
 was not lost and a buyer was found who
 was willing to carry on the business  
 and retain the well known name of     
 Jackson.  The shop carries a full     
 stock of tools and ironmongery, but it
 is still possible for a farmer to take
 his tractor to the blacksmith to be   
 repaired, or a housewife to order new 
 fire bars for an obsolete fireplace, a
 pair of iron gates  and have a new    
 bottom put in her brass coal skuttle.
