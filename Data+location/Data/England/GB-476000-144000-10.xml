		<title>10TRAFFIC AND THE VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The A31, passing through the village, 
 is a very busy and dangerous road. It 
 now by-passes many of the towns and   
 villages along its route and for much 
 of its length it is dual carriage-way.
 It is a cause of great concern that   
 despite having been in a number of    
 local plans Bentley's by-pass has not 
 been built and the very heavy traffic 
 flow still uses the single carriage-  
 way through the village at 40 mph..   
                                       
 There are frequent accidents on the   
 A31 within the village, fortunately   
 none fatal in recent times. One of the
 boys engaged on this project suffered 
 multiple fractures when involved in   
 one such accident. We hope that the   
 by-pass will be built by 1990, as     
 promised, before fatal accidents occur
 due to the ever increasing weight of  
 the growing traffic flow.             </content>
