		<content>   Holy Innocents Church,Highnam was   
 built in 1847-51,part of the extensive
 building and restoration work         
 connected with the Oxford Movement.It 
 was built for Thomas Gambier-Parry who
 developed a paint for,and carried out,
 the internal wall paintings.The large 
 church is set in the park of Highnam  
 Court,its west tower and spire visible
 for some distance as a landmark.The   
 style is Decorated,the interior       
 perhaps dim.The stained glass windows 
 depict nine scenes from the Life of   
 Christ.                               
   Close to the church are a lodge,    
 school and vicarage of similar date.  
 The school opened in 1850 and         
 continued until the move to a new     
 building in 1981.
