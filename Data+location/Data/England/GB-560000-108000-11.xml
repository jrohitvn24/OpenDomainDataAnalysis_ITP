		<title>11Weather Or Not, Horse-Eye</title>
		<content> The ecology of Horse-Eye Level has    
 been influenced by the changing       
 weather patterns of the latter part of
 the 20th century. The seasons seem to 
 be occurring later each year by up to 
 2 months sometimes. Whilst in 1984    
 this area was treated to an extremely 
 hot and sunny summer, in 1985 it was  
 by stark contrast a wet and often     
 windy summer. The winter of 1984/1985 
 was very cold, with temperatures      
 reaching record levels. The Weather   
 Station in this area has closely      
 monitored the level of rain fall and  
 the amount of sunshine hours and      
 continues to do so. It is read 365    
 days a year.
