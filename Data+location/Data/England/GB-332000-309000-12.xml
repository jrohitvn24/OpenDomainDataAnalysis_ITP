		<content> The railway line from Aberystwyth to  
 Shrewsbury goes through Halfway       
 House.Although it passes right through
 our squares we have no direct way of  
 getting on the trains so we have to go
 to Shrewsbury or Welshpool to get     
 on.The line was started in 1861 and   
 finished in 1929.Westbury station     
 closed on the 12 September 1960.The   
 line is named the Cambrian line and   
 was owned by the Cambrian Railway     
 Company and the headquarters was at   
 Oswestry. It was then taken over by   
 the Great Western Railway and now it's
 British Rail.There was talk of        
 closing the line.Now they have decided
 to improve it.Next year fast trains   
 are to be introduced.The line has     
 five crossings. One is automatic and  
 the rest are bridges except one at map
 bearing 098333.
