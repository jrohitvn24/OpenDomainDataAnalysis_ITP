		<content> Michael Thompsons farm at Grove Farm  
 is now best known for its big herd of 
 pedigree Charolais cattle.They were   
 introduced in 1967 when 4 were        
 bought.All the animals help to        
 fertilise the soil,Mr. Thompson       
 believes in organic farming.He says it
 makes no difference financially but is
 better for conservation.They now have 
 70 Charolais and a big entry in the   
 Charolais Herd book.People come from  
 all over the world to buy from the    
 Grove Farm herd.Each animal has an ear
 tag impregnated with something to keep
 the flies away.They all have a name   
 and a number.Each year has a letter   
 and that goes with the number so it is
 easy to keep worldwide records on     
 Charolais cows.The bulls are ringed at
 about 9-10 mths.The Charolais is a    
 very hardy beast,gives good meat and  
 breeds well.                          </content>
