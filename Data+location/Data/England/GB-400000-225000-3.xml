 The floors of the chambers were made  
 of stone slates. The ceilings were    
 made of flat capstones with the       
 exception of the South East chamber   
 which has a corbelled ceiling wh ere  
 each stone slightly overlaps to form a
 dome.                                 
 These mounds contain roughly enough   
 stone to build a small Parish church. 
                                       
 There is a view of the Vale of Evesham
 from Belas Knap. It overlooks fields  
 of barley and corn owned by a farmer  
 from Charlton Abbots. In the area     
 around the barrow there are 16 species
 of different plants.(2)               
                                       
 Belas Knap is just one of some 85     
 Neolithic tombs in the Cotswold-Severn
 area. (2)
