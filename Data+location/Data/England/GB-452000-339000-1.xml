		<content> This area is slightly to the west of  
 Central Nottingham. Once, the area    
 consisted of the separate villages of{
{Radford, Basford &amp; Wollaton,}but now, 
 these areas have all been incorporated
 into the{City of Nottingham.}         
   The dominant building of the area is
{Wollaton Hall,}set in a large deer    
 park and built in Elizabethan times.  
 The hall is now a {Natural History    
{Museum}and is a popular attraction for
{tourists.}                            
   The largest employer in the area is{
{'T.I. Raleigh',}cycle manufacturers,  
 with its large factory in{Radford.}   
 Another large firm is the{Shipstones  
{Brewery'}in{Basford.}                 
   The area is{largely residential.}The
 buildings in the{east}are now being   
 demolished and the area re-developed  
 whilst the{western}estates were not   
 developed until the 1920's.           </content>
