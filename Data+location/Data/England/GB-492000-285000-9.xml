		<title>09The Woodland Pytchley Hunt</title>
		<content> The Hunt meets every Boxing Day       
 morning in the square at Brigstock.   
 Foxes are still hunted and other game 
 is pursued by a variety of shooting   
 parties throughout the winter. The    
 hunt meets on Tuesdays and Saturdays  
 with an average attendance of 60-70   
 riders. There is a hunt supporters    
 association to help finances. At      
 present the kennels have 60 hounds and
 45 beagles.  When the puppies are born
 they are sent out to local people to  
 rear. Farmers send in dead lambs which
 are fed raw to the hounds. The hunt   
 extends some 20 miles both north and  
 south and 18 miles in breadth. It is  
 bounded on the north by the {         
{Cottesmore &amp; the Fernie }on the east  
 by the {Fitzwilliam }and on the west  
 by the{Pytchley and Oakley Hunts.}The 
 border line on the south is the river 
 Nene.                                 </content>
