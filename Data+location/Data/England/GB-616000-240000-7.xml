		<title>07INDUSTRY IN IPSWICH</title>
		<content> Ipswich is not known as a large       
industrial town,but it is the major    
manufacturing centre in Suffolk. In the
South-East of the town there is a great
contrast between old heavy industry and
modern light industry.                 
 A new industrial estate has been built
next to two long established works,    
i.e. Cranes and Ransoms.               
 The older factories, producing        
valves and lawnmowers remind people of 
scenes  in Northern industrial         
towns. Pollution, ugly views           
and a scruffy environment contrast     
greatly with the new estate.           
 There, bright colours,wide roads,     
clever screening by trees and grass    
banks,do not give the area a typical   
industrial feel.The firms are          
non-polluting industries such as high  
technology factories and tertiary      
services.                              </content>
