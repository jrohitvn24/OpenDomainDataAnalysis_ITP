		<content>{ }In our school grounds there is a    
{pond.}It is steep and deep because    
 it used to be a clay pit.It has over  
 30,000 {fish }in it, such as perch,   
 goldfish and fresh water eels.There   
 are frogs and some newts.Around the   
 pond there are many{birds;}mallard,   
 swallows,wagtails and coots.There     
 used to be a duck refuge in the middle
 of the pond but it sank.It was to stop
 the foxes getting the young. There are
 many{plants}and{trees}around it, from 
 oak,hawthorn and willow to bullrushes,
 lillies, lady's-smock and buttercups. 
   There are not many pond insects that
 we can find because of the fish.The   
 school has cleared some of the        
 scrub,now it is going to clear most of
 the fish and make the sides of the    
 pond more shallow.                    
   We then hope other schools will be  
 able to come and share in its study.  </content>
