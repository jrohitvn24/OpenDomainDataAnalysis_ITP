		<content>    Being a busy market town,Uckfield  
 has needed good transport.The railway 
 line and station,opened in 1858 signed
 the death warrant of the{Ouse         
{Navigation Canal}which transported    
 coal, lime, cement and chalk inland to
 Shortbridge Wharf and returned bricks,
 tiles,hops,hazel hoops(for barrel     
 making),cotton from Hempstead and     
 paper from Isfield Mills back to      
 Newhaven between 1790 and 1868.       
   {The Piltdown Man}public house and  
 monument mark a famous local spot.It  
 was claimed that the remains of a     
 prehistoric skull was unearthed near  
 the golf club.The fantastic age       
 claimed for it was disproved by modern
 tests but the pride of local folk in  
 this hoax still exists.               
    Our{picture house}exterior has been
 carefully preserved since 1916 and is 
 the oldest family run cinema around.  </content>
