		<content>    Thorney Close and South Hylton     
 Wards are two of the poorest wards in 
 the borough. They lie to the west of  
 the block. In 1981 unemployment       
 reached 40% in parts of these wards as
 it was in the Pennywell area of the   
 Grindon Ward.                         
      One indication of poverty might  
 be seen from details of car ownership 
 which is much lower than the borough  
 average in Thorney Close and South    
 Hylton. It is also much lower in the  
 Central Ward but here the population  
 is an unusual mix of students and     
 pensioners.
