     People from the area go to Leek   
Show which is an annual agricultural   
show and is held on the last Saturday  
in July at the Birchall Playing Fields 
in Leek.                               
     There are lots of competitions for
farm animals and for pets.  There are  
also competitions for flower arranging,
garden produce and craft work.         
     There are charity side-shows and  
take-away food and drink stalls.       
     There is a large exhibition ring  
in which many displays take place      
during the afternoon.                  
     Show jumping competitions are also
part of the procedings.                
     Many local firms have displays    
there, especially of farm machinery    
and cars.
