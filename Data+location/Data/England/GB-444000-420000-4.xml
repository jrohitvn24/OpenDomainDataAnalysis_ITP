		<content>   One morning when I woke and came    
 downstairs Sooty was wanting his meat.
 So were our three other cats.I gave   
 them their food and let them all out. 
 Then I got ready to play out I got the
 key for the shed got my bike then went
 for Andrew Cunningham.A lot of hours  
 later when I went in,I asked my mum   
 where Sooty was."Isn't he outside ?"  
 she said.I didn't know, but I had to  
 go to bed then. The next morning there
 was still no sign of him. The day     
 passed and I went sadly to bed,       
 however before I fell asleep Lynne    
 appeared with Sooty. She said that she
 had found him locked in the coal      
 bunker. He must have been there for   
 two days. My mum came up to tell me   
 and we gave him a big bowl of meat.   
     We also give milk to a stray cat  
 that we call Smokey, but he is still  
 very thin and skinny.by D.Cunningham. </content>
