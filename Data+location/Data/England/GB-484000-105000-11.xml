		<title>11CHICHESTER-A CICESTRIAN.</title>
		<content>{ Cicestrians,}as  the  citizens  of   
 Chichester  are known, have seen  many
 changes in their city in recent years.
 The city centre is pedestrianised, but
 it  still  remains  a {Georgian city, 
 dominated by the  Cathedral spire  and
 surrounded  by  ancient  city  walls. 
  One man  who has made his own special
 contribution  to  city  life  is      
{  Mr. Leslie Evershed-Martin O.B.E..  
 He has lived in the city  since  1932,
 has served on the city council and has
 been twice mayor. He is the founder of
 the{Chichester Festival Theatre}and   
 the{Gala.}The Theatre, built by public
 subscription, has  developed &amp; thrived
 beyond his wildest dreams. The Gala he
 started in 1955 is now firmly fixed in
 the  Chichester  calendar. The  25th  
 anniversary  of  the  C.F.T. in  1986 
 stands tribute to this  man's  vision,
 that  the impossible can be a reality.</content>
