		<title>14CHANGES IN NORTHOLT/HARROW</title>
		<content> The oldest building we investigated   
 was Welldon Park School, built 1910.  
 South Harrow was then farmland.  The  
 school was a combined infant and      
 junior school.  At its largest it     
 contained 600 children, now it is a   
 middle school with only 200 children  
 and is completely surrounded by houses
 and shops.                            
 We interviewed 10 people in depth, out
 of these 8 had lived 10 years or more 
 in the area, the longest for 49 yrs., 
 another couple for 46 yrs.The earliest
 buildings were houses and a pub,the   
 Eastcote Arms,then shops and more     
 houses,then in the last 10 yrs.,      
 maisonettes and flats predominate.    
 There is only a small area of         
 wasteland left near the railway.Now a 
 common activity is the{public planting
{of trees}and the private renewal of   
 windows,doors and roof.               </content>
