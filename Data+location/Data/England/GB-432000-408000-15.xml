		<title>15THE MINERS' STRIKE</title>
		<content> For almost the whole of the last 12   
 months the miners at our local pit,   
 North Gawber Colliery, were on strike.
 For most of the time everything was   
 quite peaceful but, early one morning,
 when it was rumoured that some miners 
 were going back to work, large numbers
 of pickets gathered outside the pit   
 gates. These are right opposite our   
 school. When we arrived at school     
 there was the smouldering remains of a
 dumper truck blocking the entrance and
 large numbers of miners gathered      
 around the entrance.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
