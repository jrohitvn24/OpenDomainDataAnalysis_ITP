		<title>01Introduction to Hoo area</title>
		<content>The villages of Brandeston,kettleburgh,
Hoo and parts of Letheringham &amp;        
Monewden are contained within this     
area,an area characterised by          
fields,fields of rape,bright yellow    
when in flower,highly perfumed fields  
of beans,peas grown for freezing,sugar 
beet &amp; even fruit-particularly black   
currants,but very little grazing land. 
 Villages are small,just one or two    
large enough to support a shop which is
a general atore-cum-post office,centre 
of village news but very helpful when  
customers are unable to get out to     
shop.                                  
 None of these villages now has a      
school so every child has to be trans- 
ported to school.Between larger        
villages are small hamlets of 6-12     
houses &amp; a church,&amp; a few isolated     
houses standing completely on their    
own.                                   </content>
