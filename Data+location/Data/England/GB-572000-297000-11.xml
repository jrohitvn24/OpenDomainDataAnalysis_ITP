 for senior citizens,provides social   
 evenings in the village hall on       
 alternate Wednesdays.Speakers,films,  
 outings and parties are much enjoyed.

 The Sports and Social club has a      
 clubhouse on the recreation ground.It 
 has a thriving sports section for     
 cricket and bowls.The licensed bar is 
 much appreciated,as we no longer have 
 a village pub.

 branch of the Oddfellows Friendly     
 society.                              </content>
