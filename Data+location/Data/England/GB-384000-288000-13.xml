Usually I have to get up and feed the  
horses,pigs,dogs,cats and cows.Then I  
have to get dressed for school.I walk  
up to Joanne's.When I come home from   
school I go up and see the rabbits.    
Yesterday I could not see them because 
I was at the Royal Show but I went up  
this morning.We have some new piglets  
but we have to sell them because we    
are moving.                            
                                       
I enjoy living on a farm because I     
help my dad take engines out of        
tractors.We have got 3 tractors and 1  
digger. Our oldest tractor is 20 to 25 
years old. Stuart and I help my dad    
tidy out his yard.In return he lets us 
wash our bikes.Then we go and get them 
dirty again.
