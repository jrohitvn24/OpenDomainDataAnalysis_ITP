  This Lighthouse offers protection    
 from the dangerous sandbanks of this  
 area of Morecambe Bay.It is run by    
 Britain's only female                 
 Lighthouse-keeper,Peggy Braithwaite.  
 The building of this Lighthouse began 
 in 1788 and was completed in 1790,the 
 structure being made of white         
 sandstone.The Lighthouse is owned by  
 the Port of Lancaster Commissioners.  
 Originally the main light was operated
 by a clockwork mechanism,now this has 
 been replaced by an electric one.     
 As well as the light the Lighthouse   
 operates a radio-beacon for Trinity   
 House.
