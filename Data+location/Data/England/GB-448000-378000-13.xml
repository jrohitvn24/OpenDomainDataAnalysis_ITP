		<title>13CHURCH AND CHAPEL</title>
		<content> I go to{Chapel}Sunday School every    
 week. We go at 10 o' clock. In March  
 we take a{Scripture exam.}On June the 
 16th (which was Father's Day) we held 
 our{Anniversary}when all the children 
 said poems,and did a play to the song 
 "Streets of London." On the 30th of   
 June we held our{Festival}of{Queens}  
 which is when {Sunday School Queens   
{from the area get}together in our     
 Chapel. On that particular day we had 
 orange and biscuits afterwards.       
 There is a{service}at Church at 10    
 o'clock and 6.30 and every first      
 Sunday in the month one at 8.00 in the
 morning.                              
 Sometimes there is a service at Thorpe
 instead of Harthill. If it is a       
 special day there is refreshments     
 afterwards in the Church room. In the 
 morning it is{Communion}and sometimes 
 Sunday School come in and sing songs .</content>
