		<content>This block is well served by religious 
establishments. This varies from the   
traditional Church of England and Roman
Catholic Churches to those of the New  
Testament of God and  temples which    
serve people in the West Indian and    
Asian communities.                     
The churches have quite large          
congregations showing that religious   
beliefs have endured.                  
As well as serving as a source of      
spiritual welfare the churches perform 
good work in the community.Churches    
such as the Portway Rd. Congregational 
Church run play schemes for children   
under 5 and others have activities for 
both children and adults.              
Churches vary in age.Most were built   
with new housing.These mount most      
activities.                            
Weddings are the most frequently       
performed ceremony.Others less so.     </content>
