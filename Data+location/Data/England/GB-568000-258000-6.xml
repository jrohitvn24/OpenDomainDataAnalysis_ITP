		<title>06JOBS ON HALL FARM.</title>
		<content> We went to Hall Farm and Robert       
 Claydon, the farmer told us about the 
 year on the farm. They start in       
 September, getting the ground ready   
 for the next year, drilling the ground
 with seeds. They also start lifting   
 sugar beet. There are 350 acres of    
 sugar beet. With machines they can    
 lift no more than 10 acres of beet a  
 day, so it takes until December.      
 Lorries come every day to collect it, 
 and before collecting, the mud is     
 shaken off. January and February are  
 the main times for maintenance. In    
 March, the farmer sprays the barley   
 and in May, the beet is sprayed,      
 otherwise the weeds get thick and the 
 crops die. In June hay is made.       
 Towards the end of July harvesting    
 starts. They get the combine out and  
 cut down corn. By the end of August   
 the jobs are done.                    </content>
