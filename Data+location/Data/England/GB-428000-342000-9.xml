    David is a very important link for 
 our villages, as he brings things that
 cannot be bought at the Post Office.  
 He is especially useful for people who
 do not have a car, as the nearest     
 shops are at Brailsford or Hulland    
 Ward.  He has been delivering milk in 
 this area for 18 years.  He delivers  
 approximately 440 bottles of milk each
 day, to 300 houses.  He travels 50    
 miles each day, delivering to         
 Allestree, Quarndon, Kedleston, Weston
 Underwood, Mugginton, Mercaston and   
 Turnditch.  He comes on Tuesday,      </content>
