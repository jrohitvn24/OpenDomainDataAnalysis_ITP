 formed to organise the Show and they  
 meet in January.They decide the       
 classes, contact 5 or 6 people to act 
 as judges, arrange insurance and get  
 schedules and entry cards printed. The
 most popular classes are for          
 vegetables and fruit.There are also   
 many beautiful flowers. Children's
