  In the area which we have covered    
there are a  number of Beef Cattle     
farms.                                 
  The bulls which do not produce milk  
are fattened up and then sent to market
to be sold as meat,then they are taken 
to an  abattoir to be slaughtered.Next 
the meat is taken to a meat market and 
sold to a family butcher or a meat     
wholesaler.   The bull hide is also    
sold to make leather which is rather   
expensive to buy.                      
  The bulls are taken out to the       
grassy pastures early in the morning   
and then brought back to special       
cattle sheds at dusk.                  
  This is the main job of the beef     
farmer.                                </content>
