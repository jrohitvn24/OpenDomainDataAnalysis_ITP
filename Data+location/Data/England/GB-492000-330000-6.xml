		<content>   We went to Great Ponton Sevice      
 Station to study the trade and        
 attitudes of customers.The following  
 results were obtained from a          
 questioniare.Of the twelve people     
 asked:                                
   1)The longest journey was from Dover
 to York and the shortest was from     
 Corby Glen to Great Ponton.Other      
 destinations included Manchester,     
 Worksop and Scunthorpe.               
   2)Eleven believed that the A1 was a 
 safe road and only one did not.Some   
 thought that the road should be       
 widened.                              
   3)Six used the road daily,three used
 it weekly,two used it monthly and one 
 rarely used the A1.                   
   Judging by the volume of trafic     
 Great Ponton Service Station has a    
 high turnover.
