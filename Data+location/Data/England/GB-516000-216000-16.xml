		<title>16Ayot House,Ayot St.Lawrence</title>
		<content>{AYOT HOUSE} was built in the 18thC.by 
 Sir Lyonel Lyde.Eight yrs. ago it was 
 made into six apartments.Some rooms   
 are very peculiar because they were   
 once passages or staircases.A secret  
 passage joins the house with the      
 pub.We cannot imagine what it was used
 for!Outside there is an Edwardian     
 swimming pool,which was heated and    
 still has its original changing room  
 with the boiler underneath.The pool   
 leaks and is being fixed but it would 
 cost Â£10,000 a year to heat.There is a
 wooden summer house that is falling   
 down.The people want to pull it down  
 but it's a listed building!We enjoyed 
 our visit and would like to live there
 because of the interesting garden.The 
 house has lots of good hiding places  
 and the secret passage!The ghost of a 
 one time gardener haunts the house and
 is supposed to be seen often!         </content>
