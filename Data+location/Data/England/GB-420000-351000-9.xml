 permanent pasture land - no crops are 
 grown.  This is used for{grazing}for  
 the dairy herd which is made up of 107
 Fresian cows, 70 calves and 3 bulls.  
 The farm has its own milking parlour. 
 This produces 350,000 litres of{milk} 
 annually which is sent to Northern    
 Dairies at Nottingham.  Also on the   
 farm are 60 lambing ewes, 12 hens and 
 the farm dog, a border collie.        
 The farm land is fenced off by low    
 hawthorn hedges, with posts and       
 barb wire where there are breaks      
 in the hedging and some dry limestone 
 walling.  A rubble-laid road, with a  
 cattle grid, leads down to the farm   
 from the B5035, the main Wirksworth to
 Ashbourne road.                       
 The landscape surrounding the farm is 
 slightly hilly with many trees.  The  
 area is covered by Electricity pylons.</content>
