  The population can be divided into   
 two groups. The first are farmers or  
 farm workers, who have lived in the   
 area for most or all of their lives.  
  The second group are the 'commuters' 
 who live in the new houses, and who   
 work out of the area, sometimes       
 travelling to Leeds or Bradford.      
 Having their own transport, they can  
 also shop out of the area, and take   
 their children to school in Ripon or  
 Harrogate.                            
  One rural beat police officer, who   
 lives in a nearby village, covers this
 area. When he is off duty a rural beat
 police officer from another area takes
 over.
