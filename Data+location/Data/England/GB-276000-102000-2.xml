		<title>02COPPLESTONE CROSS</title>
		<content> Copplestone is known for its ancient  
 cross which stands where the three    
 parishes of Down-St-Mary, Colebrook   
 and Crediton Hamlets meet.  The       
 markings on the cross represent the   
 murder of the second Bishop of        
 Devonshire around 905. He was killed  
 while on his way to see King Edward.  
 The cross is about 3m high and 50cm   
 square, and is made of granite.  The  
 actual cross piece on top of the      
 pillar is missing, though some believe
 it is in the home of the local M.P.   
 Sir Peter Mills.  A few years ago the 
 cross was moved a few metres to the   
 north so that the road could be       
 widened, and it now acts as a traffic 
 island.  There are many legends about 
 the cross, which are described on the 
 next page.
