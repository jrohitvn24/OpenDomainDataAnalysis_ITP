		<title>14YOUTH HOSTELS</title>
		<content>     In Ruckland there is a 'simple'   
 grade youth hostel called 'Woody's    
 Top', marked on some maps as 'Top     
 Barn', which indicates its previous   
 use.  It has twenty beds in three     
 dormitories, and amenities are basic  
 but well-planned.                     
     Many improvements, including      
 damp-proofing, a new dormitory        
 extension and a new kitchen set in the
 former dormitory, have been made in   
 the past year.                        
     Water has to be 'carted' from a   
 nearby farm.  However, a new mains    
 supply to the village has been        
 installed, and it is intended to      
 connect the hostel in the near future.
     It is only wardened in the summer 
 on Saturdays nights, but individuals  
 and groups can book in at other times.
 It provides a good base for school    
 parties and is popular with cyclists. </content>
