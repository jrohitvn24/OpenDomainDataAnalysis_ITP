  Mrs Harvey  told all  the children to
go to the classroom  door. We had to go
to the Hall to wait for the Animal Man.
His  real name  is Mr Pearson. He comes
to Westfield First School every year.  
  When  he came  he had  2 skunks and a
snake. He  gave the snake to  my friend
but she ran away from it.He asked us to
be very quiet. His helper brought in  a
falcon which sat on his special  glove.
He lifted his arm  and the  falcon flew
across the hall.  We all kept our heads
very  low. The  falcon  flew  towards a
window  and  hit  the glass. It fell to
the floor. When it got  up it flew back
to the Animal Man's hand.We enjoyed his
visit very much.                       
  The Animal Man lives near us now. All
his animals are at the Smestow Mill    
Wildlife Park in Wombourne.
