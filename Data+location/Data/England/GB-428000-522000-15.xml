		<title>15Heworth,Old Village Site</title>
		<content> Heworth,at present a single farm,about
 a mile north east of Aycliffe,is an   
 ancient site,divided from the village 
 by the main London-Edinburgh railway  
 and the River Skerne running North and
 South.In 1183 Heworth was held by     
 Gilbertus for 3 marks;by 1380 it was  
 owned by William de Bruys by foreign  
 service and 15s.rent. Robert de Bruys 
 sold Heworth to William Hoton in 1435 
 who in 1441 passed it to the trustees 
 of the See of Durham. On the attainder
 of Anthony Hebborne for high treason  
 in 1572 Queen Elizabeth I granted     
 possession to Sir William Drurie and  
 Ralph Scudamore.The land then passed  
 through the families of Salvin,       
 Byerley,Millbank, Watson and Swire to 
 Lord Eden.Heworth is now farmed by a  
 well known Durham farming family,the  
 Herberts.
