 "I moved into Tolworth around 1938 and
 i moved to a different in 1951.Ihave  
 been living in Hamilton Avenue for    
 quite a long time, it was quite       
 different then in those days.There has
 been many changes in the area like the
 traffic,and a lot of buildings have   
 been built,generally alot of          
 development.In those days there were  
 no worries about being run over by a  
 car as it was very rare to see one!.I 
 prefered the area in those days       
 because there was alot more           
 countryside and it was alot quieter   
 as well. The traffic was also         
 very quiet and so we could get to work
 withn no worries of being held up in  
 the traffic! The A3 used to be called 
 the Kingston Bypass.
