		<title>20Festival,Ayot St.Lawrence</title>
		<content>{AYOT ST.LAWRENCE}began having a {     
{SUMMER FESTIVAL }11yrs. ago as the    
 C.ofE. wanted to close the church as  
 too few people lived in the parish so 
 the villagers decided to pay for its  
 upkeep to keep it open.The profits    
 also pay the council back for the     
 money lent to buy the village field.  
 The festival is not the same every    
 year.The art section is the most      
 successful because the festival gets  
 20% of the profits.This year they have
 had a medieval village supper.They had
 a slave dancer,a fire-eater,and a     
 woman who dances with snakes.There was
 even a woman there with a live monkey 
 on her hat!They don't display any     
 other arts and crafts apart from      
 paintings.They tried it once but it   
 wasn't a success.The festival raises  
 over 3500 pounds for the church and   
 field each year.                      </content>
