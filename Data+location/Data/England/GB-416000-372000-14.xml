		<title>14WALKING IN WATER CUM JOLLY</title>
		<content>{WALKS.}Cressbrook Mill to Water cum   
 Jolly. This special walk on a wide    
 level gravel path along the banks of  
 the river Wye affords freedom for     
 children and dogs,and gives easy      
 access for wheelchairs.On the right   
 are deciduous woods, and across the   
 river the land rises steeply to rough 
 hill pasture.Spectacular limestone    
 rocks are reflected in the dam at     
 Water cum Jolly;a quiet sanctuary for 
 birds such as coot,water-hens,ducks,  
 dippers,grebe and the rarely seen     
 kingfisher.Frogs spawn among the reeds
 and forget-me-nots.                   
{WHITE PEAK.}The dales are peculiar to 
 Derbyshire being deep and narrow,the  
 sides covered by outcrops of rocky    
 limestone.                            
{MILLERS DALE.}Here the walk is along  
 the disused railway line which is also
 used as a cycle track.                </content>
