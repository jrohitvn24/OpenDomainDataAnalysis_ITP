		<title>02Waters Upton: the village</title>
		<content>{Waters Upton}is the main nucleated    
 settlement of this area.  It is       
 located just east of the main A442    
 road running from Wellington in the   
 south to Hodnet and Whitchurch to the 
 north.   The village was previously   
 known as Walter's Upton, named after a
 Lord of the Manor in the 16th century.
 Essentially this is an agricultural   
 community, although some dwellings    
 have been bought by commuters working 
 in{Telford},8kms to the south.   The  
 village has few services, notably a   
 Post Office/General stores, Public    
 House, and a garage on the main road  
 serving passing traffic.
