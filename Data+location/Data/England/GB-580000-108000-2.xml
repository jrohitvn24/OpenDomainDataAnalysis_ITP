		<title>02THE LANDSCAPE OF HASTINGS</title>
		<content>  The landdscape is very hilly. The    
 town is built in two valleys and three
 hills. The valleys are the Priory     
 valley and the Bourne valley. The     
 hills are the White Rock, the West and
 East hills. To the north of the town  
 is the Ridge which is the limit of    
 housing and industry.                 
  The geology is mainly sedimentary    
 rocks with the hills made of          
 sandstone.                            
  The coast is a shingle beach with    
 groynes. These stop the drift of the  
 shingle from west to east. The shingle
 thus prevents erosion of the promenade
 behind because it absorbs the energy  
 of the waves.                         
  The soils of this area contain high  
 amounts of silt which causes them to  
 be sticky when wet. The most fertile  
 soil develops on Wadhurst clay.
