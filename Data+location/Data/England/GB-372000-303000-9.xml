		<content>  They were the work of Joseph Farmer  
 who also designed the church tower.   
  The east window which was installed  
 in 1920 and shows Jesus on the cross  
 is dedicated to the youngest son of   
 the Rev. W. Blaby who was killed in   
 the First World War.                  
  There is an old rectory next to the  
 church but since 1980 the rectory has 
 been a modern house across the road.  
  There is 1 service each Sunday and   
 the congregation is usually small.    
 There is also a Sunday school with    
 about 10 children.                    
  One of the older residents recalls   
 the days earlier this century when    
 most villagers and people from the    
 surrounding hamlets attended the      
 church. Each year a Sunday school fete
 was held in a farmer's field. Children
 were also taken on horse charabanc    
 trips to the Wrekin.                  </content>
