		<content>     Some villages have their own      
 festival.{Shavington Village Festival 
 has been going since 1976 and has     
 never stopped or missed a year.The    
 Festival orginally began celebrating  
 the Queens Silver Jubilee and has     
 continiued ever since.The Festival    
 contains a procession of floats,a band
 and the cubs,scouts and brownies march
 as well.During the Festival clubs and 
 organisations set up stalls and tents 
 to raise money for their cause.This   
 takes place on the local school field.
 This needs careful organisation by the
{Village Festival Committee.           
     Since 1979,The Village Festival   
 Committee have also organised a       
 Pantomime at Christmas time.This      
 amateur production is performed by    
 local people who make their own       
 costumes and scenery.All this work is 
 done in spare time.{BY EMMA &amp; MICHELLE</content>
