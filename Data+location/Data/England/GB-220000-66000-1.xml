		<title>01DESCRIPTION OF TRENANT AREA</title>
		<content>   THIS AREA HAS NO LARGE AREAS OF     
 SETTLEMENT ALTHOUGH THERE ARE A FEW   
 HOUSES AT REDGATE. CONSEQUENTLY THERE 
 ARE NO SHOPS OR POST OFFICES. THERE   
 ARE NO BUSES EITHER SO CARS ARE VERY  
 IMPORTANT. THE INHABITANTS LOOK TO    
 SURROUNDING VILLAGES SUCH AS ST.CLEER 
 AND ST.NEOT AS WELL AS TO LISKEARD.   
  EMPLOYMENT IS MAINLY IN AGRICULTURE  
 OR FARMING. THERE IS ONE SMITHY. THERE
 IS ALSO A SCRAP YARD AND WEIGHBRIDGE. 
 SOME ALSO TRAVEL TO WORK OUTSIDE THE  
 BLOCK.                                
  ALL THE SCHOOLS ARE OTSIDE THE BLOCK 
 BUT THERE ARTE PRIMARY SCHOOLS AT ST. 
 CLEER, ST.NEOT AND DOBWALLS. THE      
 SECONDARY SCHOOL IS AT LISKEARD.      
  THE HEALTH SERVICES ARE ALSO IN      
 LISKEARD, AS ARE THE DENTISTS. THE    
 NEAREST GENERAL HOSPITAL IS IN        
 PLYMOUTH.                             
                                       </content>
