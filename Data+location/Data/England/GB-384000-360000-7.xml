 There are two large and two small     
 Council estates,semi-detached and in  
 some cases detatched houses which are 
 rented to the members of the public   
 who don't own houses of their own.The 
 estates include gardens(front and     
 rear)depending on the age and         
 situation of the houses,shops and     
 recreational facilities e.g.          
 playgrounds,tennis courts and public  
 gardens.                              
 Many private homes are also situated  
 on estates,some individual houses     
 cover large areas of land,especially  
 converted farmhouses and homes built  
 by wealthy people (1850-1920)in       
 Hightown,Mossley and West Heath       
 areas...
