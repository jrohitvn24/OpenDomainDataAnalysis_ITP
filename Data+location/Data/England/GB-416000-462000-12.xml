 MAYDAY                                
 On the first Monday of May the        
 children of the Glasshouses           
 School dance around the maypole on the
 village green for the people of the   
 village.  It starts with a parade from
 the top of the village with the May   
 Queen, her attendants and all of the  
 children from the school.             
 The children do a selection of the    
 dances which were traditionally danced
 around a maypole.  Ribbons hang down  
 from the top of the pole and each     
 child takes one, so that when         
 the children are dancing patterns are 
 made by the ribbons interweaving on   
 the pole.  During the dancing the May-
 Queen sits on her throne surrounded by
 her attendants. This event is an      
 annual one which is watched by many   
 people and always enjoyed by everyone.</content>
