		<content> There are coastal defences both at Bee
 Sands and Torcross, the former being  
 mainly of large boulders, but the     
 latter is a concrete sea wall.  The   
 coastal defences have had to be       
 replaced a number of times this       
 century alone.  A storm on the 26th   
 January 1917 destroyed the defences   
 and the village of Hallsands.  Again  
 in 1951 the defences at Torcross were 
 ruined and a repeat occurred in       
 January 1979 when half a million      
 pounds of damage was done to Torcross 
 alone.  This lead to a new concrete   
 wall being built on piles which have  
 been sunk deep into the shingle.
