		<content> Toby Wood Farm uses the old methods of
 farming. With no tractors or engines  
 to run the machinary. The power to    
 pull farm machines is provided by     
 shire horses. Most farms in the area  
 use tractors for their jobs such as   
 cutting grass for hay.                
 The farmer at Toby Wood breeds shire  
 horses, the normal price of a shire   
 horse is Â£4,000 but for a top bred    
 shire horse the price might well reach
 the sum of around Â£10,000.

 sheep as well as horses. Most of his  
 crop of oats, wheat and barley is fed 
 to the animals. The farm itself is

 with woodland, 40 acres are arable    
 and the rest is grazing.
