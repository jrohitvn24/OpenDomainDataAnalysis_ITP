		<title>06Folly Farm, Dunmow</title>
		<content>   Folly farm is a small arable farm   
 just outside Dunmow near the A120     
 Bypass. It is farmed by Mr B Tamlyn,  
 who is a tenant farmer and 2 helpers, 
 Mr Mead and Mr Tamlyn's son.          
   Folly Farm has 243 acres of arable  
 land which is divided into 70 acres of
 winter wheat, 70 acres of winter      
 barley, 24 acres of sugar beet, 17    
 acres of peas and 20 acres of spring  
 barley.                               
   The farm is drained naturally by a  
 stream but clay pipes are needed under
 each field to help improve drainage,  
 so that the soil does not get         
 water-logged.                         
   The farmhouse used to be an old     
 granary barn, but it has now been     
 converted into a house. There are five
 outside buildings - an old storage    
 barn, a grain barn, a new workshop, a 
 machines barn and an old workshop.    </content>
