		<title>04LANDSCAPE   The sea wall</title>
		<content> The sea wall at Broomhill Sands runs  
 from The Suttons to Broomhill Farm and
 is necessary at that point because the
 sea is eroding there.  The pre-war    
 wall was of clay and faggots with     
 timber groynes, but due to neglect of 
 the structure in World War II it was  
 replaced with a clay wall with steel  
 sheet piling on the seaward side.     
 Since l960 the coast defence authority
 have transported shingle from         
 Dungeness to Broomhill to maintain the
 beach in front of the wall.  This     
 beach, by the action of the sea,      
 drifts from Broomhill to Dungeness,   
 whence it returns by lorry.  The area 
 to the west of this section of sea    
 wall is a natural sand trap which is  
 constantly being built up by the      
 movement of sand in the wind.  The    
 whole area is more popular for        
 shrimping than fishing.               </content>
