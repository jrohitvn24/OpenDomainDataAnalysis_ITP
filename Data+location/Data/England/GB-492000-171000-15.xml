		<content>   Conifers grow on the Bagshot Sands  
 in one part of this area, while the   
 London Clay of the other part is best 
 suited for hard wood trees like oak.  
 Some preserved oak trees are more than
 1,000 years old.  There used to be    
 many elms but they had to be cut down 
 because of Dutch Elm disease.  Trees  
 are controlled here; many are planted 
 for quick, commercial return, but oaks
 remain until they are fully mature.   
   The area reserved for special       
 scientific interest is of great       
 importance because of the rare fungi  
 to be found there on the decaying     
 trees which are left undisturbed.     
   There are relatively few wild       
 flowers because most of the area is   
 kept very tidy.  Some of the ground is
 covered by bracken which behaves like 
 the deciduous trees, sprouting in     
 Spring and dying back in the Autumn.  </content>
