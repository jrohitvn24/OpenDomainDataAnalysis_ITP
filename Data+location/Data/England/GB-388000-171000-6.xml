 We paid a visit to Mattesons Meat Co. 
 which is a multi_national company and 
 part of Unilever.Their head office is 
 in West Ham,London.We met the site    
 manager.He told us that they bought   
 this factory in 1978 from the Oxo     
 firm, so it had already been used in  
 food production.At the time Mattesons 
 were expanding and they were not sure 
 of their future, so they bought a     
 factory larger than their present     
 needs but at a price that was right.As
 time has gone on they have increased  
 their sales and expanded into the     
 site's potential.The site manager said
 it would have cost millions of pounds 
 to have set everthing up on an        
 industrial estate from the beginning.
