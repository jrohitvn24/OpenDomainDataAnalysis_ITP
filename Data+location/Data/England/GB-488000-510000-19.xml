		<title>19Housing In Whitby.</title>
		<content>  Much of Whitby's old{housing}is to   
 be found on the East Side of Whitby.  
 Many narrow yards lead off Whitby's   
 oldest street,{Church Street}and many 
 dwellings have Preservation Orders.   
 These attractive houses with their red
 pantile roofs have become very popular
 as holiday homes.                     
  Many of the original houses on the   
 West Side of Town were built during   
 the railway boom of the 1800's.These  
 were mainly terraced houses.George    
 Hudson, the 'Railway King' from York, 
 developed the West Cliff Fields for   
 hotels and boarding houses.           
{ New housing estates}have brought many
 new families into the area.A lot of   
 these people commute out of Whitby    
 to work.                              
  The council provides housing for     
 those not able to own their own       
 property and also for the elderly.    </content>
