		<title>16Drainage at Stretton Heath.</title>
		<content>{ Mr.Hemmings,Pear Tree Farm,Stretton  
{Heath,}and some of his neighbours are 
 draining part of their land.The drain-
 age needs to be improved so that they 
 can grow crops there.Before it was    
 only used for rough grazing.          
  The pipes came from{Ireland}and cost 
{Â£14 per metre.}If they had bought them
 from Bridgnorth,Shropshire they would 
 have cost{Â£24 per metre.              
  The pipes go down from 1 metre to 5  
 and a half metres deep.The water will 
 drain to Ford and Cardeston.The bould-
 er clay will go to people who want it 
 for their gardens and some will line a
 silage pit and fill in ditches.The    
 machines which were used were a J.C.B.
 a Hymac,a stone trailer and four trac-
 tors.After the land is drained it will
 be used to grow wheat,barley and crops
 to feed livestock.They will be able to
 use heavier machines on the land.     </content>
