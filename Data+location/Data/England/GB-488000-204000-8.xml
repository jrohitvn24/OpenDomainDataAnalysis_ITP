		<title>08Nature of Work in The Lee</title>
		<content> By far the largest employer in The Lee
 is the building firm of Humphreys     
 Bros. est. in 1922. They employ 20    
 men, including 3 apprentices and 1 YOP
 trainee. They specialise in high class
 residential work within a 10 mile     
 radius. 50% of materials used are     
 second hand from demolition sites.    
 The vast majority of the people       
 employed in farming are owners or     
 tenant farmers; the Manor estate has a
 manager &amp; 2 others for both           
 agricultural &amp; forestry purposes.     
 Much work is undertaken by contract   
 workers.                              
 Many people work outside the area. The
 professions are well represented;     
 there are 5 doctors, as well as bank  
 managers, solicitors, teachers etc.   
 There are several people engaged in   
 the media, especially television.
