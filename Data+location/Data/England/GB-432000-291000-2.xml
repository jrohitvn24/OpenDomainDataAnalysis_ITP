		<content>  Much of the farmland in our area has 
 been redeveloped and replaced by large
 housing estates comprising of mainly  
 private housing.                      
  Most of the existing farmland is used
 for{grazing,}the vast majority by {   
{cattle. }                             
{ Home Farm,}in contrast,consists of   
 500 acres of which 300 are used for   
 growing{crops}such as wheat,barley,rye
 and potatoes. The remaining 200 acres 
 of land is used for growing grass used
 for pasture or for cutting for hay.   
 The farm is run by a{Mr. Charlesworth}
 and his father.                       
  Another local farmer,{Mr. Hughes}    
 keeps cattle which he takes each year 
 to{Banbury Cattle Market}to sell.     
  On the corner of Tuttle Hill and     
 Mancetter Road Nuneaton had its own   
 windmill which was in use until 1937.
