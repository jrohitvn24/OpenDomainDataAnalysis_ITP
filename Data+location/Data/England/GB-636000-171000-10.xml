		<title>10    My Family's Weekend</title>
		<content>    On Saturday I went to my nan's for 
 breakfast. Where my second cousin and 
 great Aunt were staying for a         
 fortnight. After breakfast I went to  
 get my sister Hayley because my other 
 sister Natalie and my mum were going  
 to the dentist's so my nan was going  
 to look after us. Nanny hired a beach 
 hut so we collected everything we     
 needed, put it in the car and took it 
 to the beach hut. Then we came back   
 and went to the shops to buy a small  
 dinghy. When we got home, mum was back
 from the dentist's so she came over to
 my nan's where we all had lunch       
 together. While we were having lunch  
 Concorde flew over so everyone rushed 
 for their cameras.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
