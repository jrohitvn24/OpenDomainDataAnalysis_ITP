		<content>  The village of Fulford lies south of 
an old Roman road which used to pass   
between Draycott and Blythe Bridge. It 
got its name in Anglo Saxon times, it  
is said, from the dirty brook or       
Foulford, now gone. It is a nucleated  
settlement lying in a shallow valley   
about 190m above sea level. It is      
approached by narrow  country lanes    
and has satellite hamlets of           
Crossgate, Mossgate and Spot Acre.     
Fulford has few of the amenities one   
would consider normal and this is the  
big disadvantage, there are however    
"skeleton" services which include:-    
 A General store/Postoffice-but open   
mornings only.1-Public House,1-Church, 
1-Telephone Box, a Primary School,Play 
Group,1-Youth Organisation and a Mobile
Library which visits once a week.      
  Altogether 489 persons live in the   
village in 189 dwellings.              </content>
