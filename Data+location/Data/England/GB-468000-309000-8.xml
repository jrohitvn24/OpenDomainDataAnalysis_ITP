		<title>08DAY TO DAY LIFE IN BARSBY</title>
		<content>  Most of the of the people who live in
 Barsby are  either retired, farmers or
 commutors to Leicester or Melton      
 Mowbray. There is a high percentage   
 of old people in Barsby who have lived
 there all there lives. One women      
 called Mrs Jesson allowed us to       
 interview her on how she saw life in  
 Barsby. Mrs Jesson has lived in Barsby
 for thirteen years. Since Mrs Jesson  
 has moved to Barsby all the shops have
 closed down the bus service stopped,  
 and the old local pub has been        
 modernised out of all recognition.    
 Many of the houses in Barsby have been
 renovated and updated, but thankfully 
 most of these have retained the       
 original character of the building.   
 Mrs Jesson feels that the pace of life
 is slow compared to that of the city  
 people. everyone doing their own thing
 in there own time.                    </content>
