		<content>{Wheat and Barley}are grown on one     
 local farm covering 102 acres. There  
 is grazing for{120 cows, 60 pigs}and  
{11 horses.}The same family has always 
 farmed this farm, which has 3 farm    
 hands. Sometimes a bad winter makes   
 life hard but the{cows}can remain     
 indoors and the crops are rarely      
 damaged by extreme cold. A farmers    
 working day usually consists of 14 -  
 15 hours starting at 4 a.m.           
 One of the largest farms in our area  
 is over 600 acres. It is one of a     
 collection of smaller farms. The crops
 are{Wheat, Barley and Oil Seed Rape,  
 the animals are{Beef Cattle and Sheep.
 The oldest part of the buildings is   
 200 years old and farming is no longer
 the leisurely process it was when the 
 farm was first built. One problem the 
 farmer has is local children trampling
 on his crops.                         </content>
