 there are small businesses.These are  
 not scattered about but are in small  
 groups,with all the same types of     
 firms put together.Staple Tye has a   
 printers,a clothing manufacturer,car  
 work shops,a double glazing company   
 and a gift wrapping paper company.    
 There is a dairy at Bush Fair,another 
 shopping area.They employ 30 people   
 who work on the milk floats and in the
 offices.They distribute 10 000 bottles
 of milk a day and they also supply the
 villages surrounding Harlow.The       
 milkmen who deliver to the            
 villages,drive special large floats   
 that sometimes cover 50 miles a day.
