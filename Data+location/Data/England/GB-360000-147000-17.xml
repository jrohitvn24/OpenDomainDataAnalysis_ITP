		<title>17DAY IN LIFE OF BOY 1925</title>
		<content> Stanley Bevan was born in Oakhill 72  
 yrs. ago. As a child his day began at 
 6.00am., when the first shift went to 
 the brewery and he would do his odd   
 jobs, giving any money he earned to   
 his mother. At 8.00am. there was      
 breakfast and he would roll his iron  
 hoop to school for 9.00am. He attended
 the church school but it was not      
 opened if there were less than 80     
 pupils. Children wore blazers, caps   
 and hob nail boots, and got the cane  
 if they were naughty. Lunch was bread 
 and jam which he brought to school. He
 left school at the age of 12. The     
 Brewery employed all the good men and 
 he became a lorry driver for them.    
 Wages were 16/- a week(rent was 3/-)  
 The Brewery employed 100 people and he
 well remembers the night it burnt down
 and the heat was so bad his mother had
 to leave the house.                   </content>
