		<content> The original Building, now 105 years  
old,was built in 200 acres of parkland.
It was originally known as the County 
Lunatic Asylum' when the average stay  
was a whole lifetime compared with the 
six months of today. Many parts have   
since been added &amp; it is planned to    
demolish the first building,now out-   
dated &amp; unsuitable for modern treatment
There are 425 patients divided into 25 
wards with an average of 24 beds per   
ward. The patients are admitted by a   
Consultant Psychiatrist. If they are   
over 65 &amp; senile they go into a mixed  
Mentally and Infirm Unit'. Others go  
into one of the three admission wards. 
If a cure is not effected after six    
months, the patients are either        
referred to Outpatients or sent to a   
Rehabilitation Centre.
