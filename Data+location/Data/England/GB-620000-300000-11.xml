		<title>11Stoke Holy Cross Mill</title>
		<content> There has been a water mill here on   
 the River Tas since the early Middle  
 Ages. It was burnt down and rebuilt   
 twice in the eighteenth century. It   
 was owned by Colman's of Norwich for  
 some time before they moved to        
 Norwich. It ceased to grind corn in   
 1940's and had a variety of uses      
 before being converted into a         
 restaurant in 1975.                   
 It is owned by an Italian and serves  
 high class meals, about one hundred   
 per week. There is a chef, a waiter   
 and two kitchen assistants.
