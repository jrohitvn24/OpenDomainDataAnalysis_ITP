In the south-east corner of            
Wellingborough is a Youth Custody      
Centre. Formerly called the Borstal the
Centre caters for boys from sixteen to 
about twenty-two. Boys are sent to the 
 entre for commiting crimes like A.B.H.
and criminal damage for periods of four
months to four years. At the moment    
there are 360 boys in there with about 
60 staff on duty at any one time. The  
boys' day is a mixture of education    
classes and a period of relaxation     
called Association. The centre has six 
self-contained wings,a central kitchen,
a laundry, a hospital and a secure area
for boys who have misbehaved. Outside  
the buildings there are further        
workshops, a garden, small farm and    
some outside sports areas. The boys    
can earn a wage of about two pounds    
a week.                                </content>
