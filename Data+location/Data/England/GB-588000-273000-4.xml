		<content>The present school serves the villages 
of Honington, and Troston, plus a      
substantial intake from the RAF base   
just a mile-and-a-half from the main   
village; a school population of        
approximately 130 children, with the   
inevitable high mobility of service    
children.                              
At one time the school boasted some 300
children, before the RAF spread their  
personnel over a wider catchment area  
and the present climate of falling     
rolls. At that time two classes were   
educated in an annexe near to the RAF  
base whilst temporary 'caravans' were  
in use in the school grounds. One of   
these remains in use,whilst use of the 
annexe ceased in 1976.
