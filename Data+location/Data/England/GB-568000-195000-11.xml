		<title>11 WAR MEMORIAL</title>
		<content>  In the centre of the village in {    
{RAMSDEN HEATH }is a {WAR MEMORIAL}    
 about 2.5mhigh. It is protected by a  
 green fence which is about 0.5m high. 
  This is in the triangle of grass     
 which is near the {WHITE HORSE PUB.   
{     }This is what it says:-          
    To the glory of GOD and the honour 
 of the men of{RAMSDEN BELLHOUSE}who   
 gave their lives for king and country 
 in the great war. 1914-1919. This     
 monument is erected in proud and      
 affectionate memory by their{GREAT}   
 fellow parishioners.{THEIR NAME LIVETH
{FOR EVER MORE.}                       
  These are some of the names :-       
{ADEY.J.C,  ASTELL.N.E.     AMOS.T,    
{DOBLE.L,   GILBERT.D.T,    VOYCE.J.H.C
{SHEAD.G.L, HOLLIS.E.K,(}nurse{)       
 I think it is not very nice that all  
 of these people are  not remembered in
 the way that they should be.          </content>
