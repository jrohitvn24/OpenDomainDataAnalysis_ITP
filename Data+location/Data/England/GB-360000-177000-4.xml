		<title>04Filton Train Services</title>
		<content>  Some children wrote a letter to the  
 area manager of Temple Meads Station  
 to find information on train services.
  The reply gave us this information:  
 Bristol Parkway station was built in  
 1972.The idea was to build a station  
 outside the centre of Bristol which   
 was near the Motorway and main roads  
 so it would be easy for people to     
 drive to.Because Parkway is out in the
 country there is a lot of room to park
 Atleast 1000 people use the station   
 each day and some 75 trains stop there
 on their way to London,Wales,the      
 South, the North and Scotland.        
     North Filton Platform is only used
 by one train each morning and evening 
 for people working at factories       
 nearby.Filton Junction has 9 trains a 
 day and is used by a few dozen people.
 There is no station at Filton West    
 Junction.                             </content>
