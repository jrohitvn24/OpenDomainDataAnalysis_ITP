		<content>  Quinmoor Farmhouse is a popular venue
 for foreign and British tourists who  
 appreciate the high standard of 'bed &amp;
 breakfast' accomodation in such       
 interesting surroundings.             
  The 17th century Fox Inn has been a  
 public house in Broadwell for 200     
 years. It was owned by the Lord of the
 Manor or principal farmer. During the 
 morning the field workers would go    
 there for free cider,bread and cheese.
 Since the breweries bought the pubs 50
 years ago, the landlord must sell     
 their draught beers but can supplement
 trade by selling wines and spirits,   
 providing delicious meals and         
 overnight accommodation. 'The Fox' is 
 the social centre of the village. 'The
 Horse and Groom' and 'The Fox' at     
 Oddington provide similar facilities.
