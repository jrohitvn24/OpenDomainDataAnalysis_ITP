		<content> It is a pretty place and there is easy
 access to many towns and well known   
 areas.One aspect of the{village}which 
 everyone hates,however,is the A39     
 which runs directly through Ashcott.It
 is dangerous,the speed limit is seldom
 heeded,and the{traffic}is noisy,dirty,
 smelly,and much too frequent and heavy
 for the small road.Though the         
{inhabitants,}many of whom were born   
 there are very happy,they are         
 petrified of the road and want it to  
 go.  The{government}are cosidering    
 building a by-pass.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
