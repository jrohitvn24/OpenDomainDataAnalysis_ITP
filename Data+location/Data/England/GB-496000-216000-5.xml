		<content>The First School in Dagnall.The village
school was built in Victorian times to 
cater for children in the 5 to 11      
age range but since a county           
reorganisation the age range has been 5
to 8. At one time over 50 children     
attended the school and there were 2   
teahers but the numbers have fallen and
there are now  only 29 children and one
teacher.The school has a small outside 
learner swimming pool built by the     
fundraising efforts of the parents and 
the school buildings are used for      
evening classes.At the age of 8 the    
children transfer to the Middle School 
at Edlesborough.
