		<title>14QUARRIES IN ST.BREWARD AREA</title>
		<content>                                       
 At the present day there are three    
 working quarries in our area. they are
 Hantergantick, Delank and Tor Down.   
 the biggest of these are in the Delank
 valley, they are Hantergantick and    
 Delank.                               
 In the old days there were about six  
 quarries in the area and because of   
 this the village of St.Breward was    
 quite well known and had nine shops,  
 where as now there are only three.    
                                       
{DELANK QUARRY:}No one really knows how
 long Delank Quarry has been working   
 but it is thought to be about 250     
 years.  Years ago they cut granite by 
 hand but now use machines.  However,  
 recently a statue of nurse Edith      
 Cavell was carved from granite taken  
 from Delank using hand tools only.
