		<content> There are two distinct area of        
 employment, these being on the farms  
 and in the nearby towns and           
 cities. Those persons employed in     
 agriculture work either for local     
 farmers or for animal rearing         
 establishments such as Cotswold Pigs  
 and Cherry Valley Duckling Farms. At  
 least one farmer provides contract    
 services such as rape seed harvesting 
 over a wide area from his base in     
 Claxby. Non agricultural employment   
 within the area is minimal. Most other
 people in employment travel to the    
 nearby towns of Market Rasen and      
 Caisor, where there are a number of   
 employers, principally in             
 agriculturally related industries as  
 well as the usual services. A number  
 of residents also travel to Lincoln   
 and Grimsby.                          
                                       </content>
