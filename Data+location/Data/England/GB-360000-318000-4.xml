		<content> This block is full of rich            
 agricultural land.   The soils are    
 formed from boulder clay which covers 
 New Red Sandstone rock.   The moderate
 rainfall and sunny summers encourage  
 good grass growth, suitable for       
{pastoral farming (dairying). } The    
 land is generally flat or gently      
 rolling. The drainage of the soil does
 vary within the area, and this has    
 played a major role in determining    
 land use. The moister areas are used  
 for improved pasture and the drier    
 areas for cereal production, chiefly  
 for animal feed.   The chief crop is  
{barley,}some of which is sent to      
 breweries in the West Midland         
 conurbation, eg at Wolverhampton.     
 The chief type of stock is Fresian    
 dairy cattle.   Farms are large and   
 well eqipped.
