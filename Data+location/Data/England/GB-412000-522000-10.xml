		<content>   Mr and Mrs Littlefair are young     
 progressive farmers,although they     
 appreciate and use the old buildings  
 they have recently built a new complex
 of buildings including a large byre   
 for winter housing a modern milking   
 parlour,a silage pit and a slurry     
 lagoon.Recently 10 of their 151 acres 
 have been taken by the N.C.B. for     
 opencast mining,but the remainder is  
 used for grazing their herd of fresian
 cows and for producing silage.The     
 Littlefairs have decided to put all   
 their efforts into dairy cattle and   
 silage,though they do have a milk     
 round.They sell their milk to the Milk
 Marketing board from whom they buy the
 milk for their customers.Mr &amp; Mrs     
 Littlefair employ one farm hand full  
 time and contract their silage making 
 to an outside firm.
