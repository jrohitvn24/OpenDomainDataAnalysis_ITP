		<title>08WALTHAM ABBEY TOWN CLERK.</title>
		<content> On the 27th June,1985, a group from   
 class 4R interviewed the Town Clerk,  
 at{Waltham Abbey Town Hall.           
                                       
{Mr Berry}has been Town Clerk for      
 eleven years. He finds it a very      
 enjoyable job. A town clerk may serve 
 until retirement.                     
                                       
 During the day he works from 8.45 a.m.
 till 5 p.m. But he often has to return
 at 7 p.m. for evening meetings, and he
 also attends functions with the Mayor.
                                       
 He has to be well informed because he 
 has to keep the council informed and  
 on occasions give them advice.        
                                       
 Mr Berry receives lots of letters -   
 quite a few of them are complaints!
