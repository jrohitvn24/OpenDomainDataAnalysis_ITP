		<content> On an old map of our area we found    
 Northfield House and when we          
 investigated, we found it was still   
 standing.                             
 It is now part of Billingham Golf Club
 and has been turned into accomodation 
 for the club professional. The club   
 was formed in 1963 and has a lease    
 from Stockton Council for 50 years but
 the club hopes to continue for much   
 longer.                               
 The course covers some 130 acres      
 (which is very close to the areas of  
 land covered in the original Domesday 
 survey of 120 acres) and a lot of work
 has gone into it with landscaping and 
 tree planting which will show up in   
 years to come.                        
 The club has about 1000 members       
 including playing and social members.
