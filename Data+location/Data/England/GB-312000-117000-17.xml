		<title>17Wildlife in Wellington</title>
		<content>   Being a very rural area we are      
 well endowed with wildlife.There are a
 number of varing habitats in which    
 fauna and flora can exist in relative 
 peace.                                
  One major habitat is the decidious   
 woodland on the Blackdown Hills.      
 Within this woodland live at least one
 family of Foxes, Badgers ,Blackbirds  
 Wood Warblers,Woodpeckers and many    
 other common species.The wood is      
 mainly made up of Beech trees but     
 there is also a number of oaks and    
 some Dutch Elm.On the slopes below the
 wood there is an untouched meadowland 
 in which grow some Meadow Orchid or   
 Early Marsh Orchid. There is a large  
 Rookery just opposite  Pyles Thorne   
 road.A number of Buzzards can be seen 
 flying over head and kestrels are     
 regulary seen hovering over the       
 motorway verges.                      </content>
