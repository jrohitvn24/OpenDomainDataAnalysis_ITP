		<title>07Customs - Playground games</title>
		<content> The school yard is marked with lines  
 for tennis and rounders.  One game we 
 play is a game of chase called Line   
 Tig, but you are only allowed to run  
 on these lines.  One person chases the
 others until someone is caught - then 
 they are said to be "on" - they are   
 now the chaser.                       
 Skipping games were popular at my     
 Primary School.  In one game a long   
 piece of rope was turned by two       
 children whilst others in turn jumped 
 over the rope.  The jumper chanted the
 following: Bumper car, bumper car,    
 number 48,  Take it round the corner, 
 slam on the brakes.  But the brakes   
 don't work, so you take it to the     
 garage.  How many gallons do you need?
 (The number of jumps made).           
 Other chants had names such as Banana 
 Splits, England-Ireland, Ibble Obble, 
 Mickey Mouse and Peter Pan.           </content>
