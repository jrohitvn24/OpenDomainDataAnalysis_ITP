<title>21I remember writing this!</title>
<content>I attended Nether Alderley School, but had previously attended Over Alderley school, where Mrs Pat Cross had been headmistress. When Over Alderley school closed the staff and pupils all transfered to Nether Alderley School. I remember typing this part ".The school bell was rung from inside the junior class. The  door was very big but it had a little  door inside called a wicket door." of the article on a BBC computer, I may have written more of it.&lt;br />
