		<content> By far the greater portion of the     
 block is under grass supporting       
 cattle, sheep and a few pigs. All the 
 facilities in the block are to be     
 found                                 
 in the village itself. Here a post    
 office parish church, public house nd 
 a village hall are close together all 
 are well used. There is one small     
 workshop which copes with electronic  
 and mechanical defects. A grass drying
 business provides welcome employment  
 for many local men and women one      
 private house offers bed and breakfast
 facilities.
