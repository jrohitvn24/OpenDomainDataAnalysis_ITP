		<title>03About Our School.</title>
		<content> Chelsfield is an old school.It has 3  
teachers and 60 children.It is a       
village school and is very small.There 
are 2 playgrounds and behind the       
outside toilets is a patch of lawn     
where we play in the summer.On the     
grass there is also some steel framed  
gymnastic apparatus.Mrs.Richadrson is  
the headmistress and Mr.Eshelby is the 
Deputy head.                           
 I think our school is very nice even  
if it is very small.When you look at   
our school it looks like a house with  
a front door and little windows.Go     
upstairs and there are some little     
rooms where the headmaster used to     
live.Now it is Mrs.Richardson's and    
the teacher's rooms,Mrs Quantic also   
has her office there too.Simon thinks  
it is where the bedrooms are because   
you have to go upstairs to get there.
