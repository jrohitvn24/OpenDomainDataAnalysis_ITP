		<content>     Most of this area is covered by a 
 large council housing estate,the      
 Leaside Way  area.Another area is     
 taken up by 1920s suburban parts of   
 Swaythling.To the north,outside the   
 city boundary,there are playing fields
 used by sports clubs and schools.     
  (Transport)                          
             The M27 motorway passes   
 through the area and Junction 5 is in 
 a corner.A link road is planned to    
 pass through the area to join         
 Portswood and Swaythling to the       
 M27,being part of the A335.There is   
 also a small part of the railway to   
 London.There is a low railway bridge  
 (known as the Black Arch)over the     
 A27 (A335).It is a bottleneck and     
 accident blackspot.Bassett Green Road 
 is a main road(A27).                  
  Two city bus routes end here,and     
 county buses go up Stoneham Lane.     </content>
