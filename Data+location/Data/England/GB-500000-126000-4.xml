		<content>  Our area has approximately 328       
 buildings.A mixture of modern and     
 older properties are spaced out along 
 the Petworth,Wisborough Green and     
 Plaistow roads.They belong to three   
 periods.The first is the end of the   
 16th early 17th century which includes
 most of the old houses.They are found 
 around the church and show signs of a 
 timber framed structure.Six have      
 Horsham stone roofs.The second        
 building period is that of the 18th   
 century when some of the larger estate
 buildings were constructed.The third  
 period is since 1945 when Townfield   
 estate originally all council owned   
 and others privately owned houses,    
 flats and bungalows were built. All   
 the houses in the area have gardens   
 which are well looked after.          
 Electricity,mains drainage came to the
 village at this time.                 </content>
