		<title>07A VISIT TO THORPE MARKET</title>
		<content> On our visit to the Market we had to  
 park more than half a mile away and   
 walk to it. There were many stalls    
 selling clothes,shoes, vegetables,    
 jewellery, china and house_hold stuff.
 There were others where you could buy 
 electronic games, toys and books.     
 On one stall there were some very old 
 swords which were made of metal and   
 were curved. There was one man with a 
 microphone attached to him which he   
 spoke through and it made his voice   
 very loud. This man is called a       
 barker.                               
 In the covered part of the market is  
 an auctioneer and people were bidding 
 for furniture and plants. A big crowd 
 was standing round him and we had a   
 job to see what was going on.         
 Although there were a lot of people   
 there, Thorpe Market isn't as busy or 
 as big as Clacton Market.             </content>
