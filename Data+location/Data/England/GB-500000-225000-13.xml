		<title>13Chalton Village</title>
		<content> In Chalton there are 185 houses,some  
 small,others large.One of the oldest  
 houses in Chalton is{Costelow house.  
 The exact dates are not known,but it  
 is thought to have been built around  
 1540.The house was derelict until     
 after the war.Until a builder restored
 Costelow house,only one room was safe.
 Costelow house is now occupied by the 
 Willons.Up until 1950,Chalton was     
 quite a small village.During the '60s 
 the turning point began,starting with 
 Chalton Heights.After Chalton         
 Heights was taken down ,so were many  
 others.These were replaced by modern  
 houses.In Chalton there are strange   
 looking bungalows.The bricks which the
 house were made of are Caddington     
 greys.They have a distinctive{ABC     
 marked on them,this stands for{ALFRED 
{BIRD CHALTON.
