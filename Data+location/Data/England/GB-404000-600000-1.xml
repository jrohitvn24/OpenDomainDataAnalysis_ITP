		<content> Rothbury lies to the west of the      
 A697 Morpeth to Wooler road,          
 approximately 15 miles north west of  
 Morpeth and 13 miles south west of    
 Alnwick.  In winter time some minor   
 roads into Rothbury are blocked by    
 snow but it is a very popular place in
 the summer.  There is a wide range of 
 accommodation for summer visitors     
 including licensed premises, private  
 homes and caravans.  Rothbury is      
 surrounded by beautiful hills and     
 moorland and is the starting point for
 visits into the Coquet valley.  There 
 are ancient rock carvings and a       
 fortified settlement on Lordenshaw,   
 which is within walking distance, to  
 the south of Rothbury.  Cragside, a   
 National Trust Property, lies just    
 outside the village to the east.
