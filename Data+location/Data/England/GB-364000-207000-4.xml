		<content>   Trees are felled by chainsaw and,   
 after snedding, the trees are taken to
 the forest's edge. When new trees are 
 planted they are protected by         
 fibreglass tubes to prevent them being
 nibbled by rabbits, sheep and deer;   
 parts of the forest are also fenced   
 for this reason. Some softwood is sold
 for pit-props locally but most goes   
 for re-processing in the locality as  
 'artificial' compressed board. More   
 valuable timber (sawlogs) is sold to  
 the highest bidder in parcels as areas
 are felled. Specialist products       
 (veneers) are sold after negotiation. 
 Small timber left after felling is    
 sold in parcels to local people for   
 firewood. Bark peelings from oak trees
 are also sold for use in the tanning  
 process as are other peelings which   
 make good ground covering for riding  
 stables.                              </content>
