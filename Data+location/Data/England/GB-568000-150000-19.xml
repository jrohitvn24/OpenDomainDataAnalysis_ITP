 Indigenous trees are predominantly    
 oak, ash, also hedgerow elms which    
 die at about 6 metres tall, presumably
 from Dutch elm disease. By the river- 
 side are alder and willow. Soil greedy
 poplars used for windbreaks are being 
 replaced by soil enriching alders.    
 Hedgerows, some believed very old,    
 include hawthorn, field maple and     
 hazel. Typical woodland flora includes
 abundant bluebells with celandines,   
 yellow archangel, wood anemones,      
 primroses and wild violets. Greybury  
 Wood, of coppiced chestnut, is a mass 
 of bluebells in May. Low lying ground 
 has meadowsweet, purple loosestrife,  
 Himalayan balsam, yellow flag irises, 
 kingcups and reeds. Fauna is diverse  
 with many rabbits and foxes, some     
 badgers and mink and a good spread of 
 resident birds.                       </content>
