  Queen Alexandra Hospital had its     
 first patients on 10th March 1908 when
 the first 100 servicemen moved in.    
 There are three 120 bed ward floors   
 which are divided into six, four or   
 single bed bays. An 86 bed unit on the
 seventh floor treats children/        
  The latest aids to twentieth century 
 medicine combine with highly skilled  
 operating teams to restore good       
 health. The accident and emergency    
 department provides a 24 hour service.
 In a year the department recieves     
 55000 attendances with an average     
 workload of 160 cases a day. More than
 2000 meals are provided each day and  
 there are homes for 150 hospital      
 staff.
