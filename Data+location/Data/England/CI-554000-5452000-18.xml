		<title>18WESTERN MINIATURE RIFLE CLUB</title>
		<content> A few hundred yards from St Ouen's    
 Parish Church is the clubhouse of the 
 Western Miniature Rifle Club.         
                                       
 To become a member you pay Â£16.00 a   
 year and this lets you shoot on a     
 Tuesday evening throughout the winter 
 from 19.15 to 22.30hrs.               
                                       
 If you become good enough you can     
 enter competitions with other clubs.  
 Most competition nights are on a      
 Friday.                               
                                       
 The club has between 50 and 60        
 members.                              
                                       
 The members are of all ages and from  
 all backgrounds.                      
                                       
 Safety-first is the rule which is     
 very important in this club.          </content>
