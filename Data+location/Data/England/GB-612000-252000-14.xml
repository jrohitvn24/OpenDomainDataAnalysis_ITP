		<title>14Worship in Coddenham Area</title>
		<content> Services are held every Sunday in the 
 3 Christian Churches in this area and 
 Coddenham Church runs a children's    
 Sunday School. St Mary's Coddenham and
 St Gregory's Hemingstone together with
 two adjoining parishes are united in  
 one benefice of the church of England,
 to which a new Rector was inducted on 
 25 April 1985. On this occasion       
 Coddenham Church was packed but the   
 regular average congregation is 30-40 
 persons and Hemmingstone, half this   
 number. Harvest Festival attracts the 
 greatest number of worshippers. The   
 Methodist Chapel in Coddenham is part 
 of the Ipswich circuit; services are  
 conducted by the Minister once a month
 and otherwise by lay people; about 16 
 in the congregation. The main concern 
 of Church members is how to heat and  
 maintain their ancient buildings. Fund
 raising events are well supported.    </content>
