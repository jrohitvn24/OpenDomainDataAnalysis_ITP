		<content> The Community Action Group Thursday   
 club in Kingsway Clifton is a special 
 club meeting for young people in the  
 Kingsway area of Clifton.This is an   
 area of council housing built just    
 after the war to cater for slum       
 clearance. The children and young     
 people go to the club as a break from 
 home and their parents and for        
 somewhere to go in the evenings. They 
 can play snooker, table tennis and    
 football or just talk and listen to   
 records. The Centre is staffed by     
 volunteers and two students from      
 St.Johns teacher training college in  
 York. Patrick Allen and Natasza       
 Kielbinska recently won Â£1000 and a   
 Dettol Caring Award for their work at 
 the Centre. They intend to use the    
 money on equipment. The award was     
 presented by Princess Anne on the     
 B.B.C. Pebble Mill programme in May.  </content>
