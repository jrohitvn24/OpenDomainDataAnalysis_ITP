		<title>05    Cliftonville Hotels</title>
		<content>    Many of the hotels and guest houses
 of the Edgar Road and Surrey Road are 
 more than fifty years old. They were  
 built at a time when very few English 
 families took their holidays abroad.  
 Now, despite active advertising the   
 hotels are distinctly under used. The 
 short family season of July and August
 has been extended by concession rates 
 to OAP groups. Some conventioneers may
 use the Winter Gardens out of season. 
    Solutions to this problem of under 
 use are varied. Some hotels are large 
 enough to provide indoor entertainment
 others have become almost permanent   
 homes for old people. London Boroughs 
 have bought some for their own use.   
 Others are now schools of English for 
 foreign students.
