		<content>  There is a theatre and cinema        
 combined in Sun Street known as the   
 'Roses Theatre'.This provides the town
 not only with a weekly programme of   
 the most current and popular films,but
 also a very varied programme of live  
 entertainment.                        
  The town has a museum situated in    
 Barton Street.It was formed by the    
 conversion of two of the oldest       
 half-timbered buildings and restored  
 to its present state.The tourist      
 information office is within this     
 building.                             
  The George Watson Memorial Hall is   
 next to the museum and provides       
 facilities for local clubs and for    
 live entertainment.                   
  Named after John Moore,the           
 Countryside Museum is housed in one of
 the Abbey cottages.This museum        
 reflects his love of the countryside. </content>
