		<title>17The Holmes</title>
		<content> The Holmes is 369 acres of grassland  
 either side of the River Trent.It is  
 mentioned in the Domesday Book as     
 water meadows. It has been            
 administered as Common Land since that
 time.The Overseer of the Holmes is    
 responsible for their upkeep and their
 administration,jointly with the Holmes
 Committee.A Spring auction is held and
 parcels of land called 'gaits' are let
 to anyone wanting to graze cattle on  
 the Holmes.Sheep are only allowed on  
 the East of the river,on Smithey      
 Marsh. There is no winter grazing     
 allowed.There are approximately 448   
 gaits of land.The ecology is that of  
 meadow land,plants are those normally 
 found but may be heavily grazed.      
 Skylarks are common,as are most birds 
 of field and hedgerow. Water fowl are 
 to be found on the river.The hedgerows
 are ancient ones;interesting habitats.</content>
