		<content>   The "Villager"is produced by the    
 Village Association.The Editor is a   
 committee member.The magazine is typed
 on wax stencils and then run off.The  
 covers are printed by someone else.It 
 costs Â£120 a month for 2200 copies,   
 about 5p a copy.This is paid for by   
 revenue from the adverts.A group of   
 ladies fold and count them out into   
 bundles for each street.A man delivers
 them to 12 distributors who take them 
 round to the delivery people.         
   Articles are mainly about events in 
 the village and charity announcements 
 about church services and fund raising
 events.In January the magazine is the 
 Guide to every organisation in the    
 village including councillors,schools 
 and any information that would be     
 helpful. Sometimes people send letters
 about things that annoy them and      
 sometimes the council put some in too.</content>
