		<content>    All church organisations take part 
 supported by music from local bands.  
                                       
    For recreation throughout the year 
 we have two large open spaces, but    
 they are not supervised, and we feel  
 that more could be done to provide for
 young people's leisure activities. The
 previous information demonstrates the 
 active community life which the people
 have built for themselves. There are  
 constant new endeavours; the carnival 
 committee have developed an annual    
 fun-run as just one of many activities
 spawned by their remarkable event.    
                                       
    This success as a community is     
 despite the fact that most parents    
 have to travel away from the area to  
 work although we do have a few small  
 industries and Leonard Fairclough     
 Civil Engineering.                    </content>
