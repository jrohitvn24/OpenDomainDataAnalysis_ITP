		<title>14PLANTS AND FLOWERS</title>
		<content> We went up to the naze to find and    
 study plants.Around the Naze Tower we 
 found a variety of plants.The         
 stonecrop we actually found growing on
 the tower.We also found it had a very 
 distinct taste of pepper.We discovered
  that there were many different types 
 of grasses.There were small flowers   
 that were a member of the sweet pea   
 family.A very pretty one  was the     
 scarlet pimpernel that we found under 
 a gorse bush along with a woody       
 nightshade which is poisonous.We also 
 found very common ones like daisy and 
 buttercup.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
