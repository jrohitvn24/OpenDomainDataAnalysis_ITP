		<content> witnessed a decline in business,      
 especially in commercial trade in the 
 town. Many shops in the High Street   
 have closed down and premises stand   
 vacant.There is talk of some of the   
 properties being converted into office
 space; but this has not been          
 confirmed. The crime rate is low, in  
 line with most wealthy areas. The     
 paper receives information on crime   
 from the headquarters of crime        
 prevention in Watford.                
   Current important issues concern    
 plans for the alteration of the Three 
 Rivers District Council boundaries,   
 following the completion of the       
 M25 nearby. This would effectively    
 remove Chorleywood from the Council's 
 control. The proposed closure of the  
 main line train service between       
 Marylebone and Aylesbury would result 
 in a depleted commuter service.       </content>
