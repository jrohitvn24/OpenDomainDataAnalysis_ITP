		<title>18Tregadillett Chapel</title>
		<content> The present Methodist chapel was built
 in 1873 to replace the nearby small   
 cob building that was becoming too    
 small for the congregation.This then  
 became a day school in oppositon to   
 the Church of England School in the   
 village.(There were frequent fights   
 between the boys of the two           
 schools.The Church school boys were   
 known as Greyhounds and the chapel    
 boys as Spaniels.)The change in       
 attitude and religious practice can be
 seen when it is known that in 1873    
 there were 45-50 chapel members and a 
 Sunday School of 35-40.At that time   
 there were only 14 houses in the      
 village,plus the neighbouring         
 farms.Today the population of         
 Tregadillett is approx.1000 and the   
 chapel membership is 40-45 and a      
 Sunday School of 25-30 but this is a  
 joint Sunday School with the C.of E.  </content>
