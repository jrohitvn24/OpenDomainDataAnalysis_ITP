		<title>16Arts &amp; crafts in Thurlow</title>
		<content> Handicrafts have always been an       
 accepted pastime here as in most rural
 areas, wives and mothers traditionally
 knit and crochet for their families   
 and the Wi encourages these along with
 cross stitch and etching embroidery   
 and corn dolly making. Less usual     
 crafts include lace making, using     
 spangle bobbins weighted by beads, adn
 needing from 5 pairs for a simple     
 bookmark to over 100 for a parasol.   
 Spinning wool is another old craft    
 revived and which produces a lovely   
 soft thread. Examples of patchwork can
 be seen, 2 inch octagons painstakingly
 sewn together by hand, church         
 embroidery and basketry have enjoyed a
 revival, and one lady talented at soft
 toy making teaches this at nearby     
 Highpoint prison. There are several   
 good amateur photographers, a potter  
 and a painter.                        </content>
