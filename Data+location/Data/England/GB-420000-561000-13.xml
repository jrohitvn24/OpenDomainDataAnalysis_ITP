		<title>13LIVING IN SOUTH BENWELL</title>
		<content>   The area is made up of a majority of
{young people,}many of whom are        
 students, who have lived in this area 
 for less than five years. Old age     
{pensioners}make up the remainder of   
 the people and many of them had spent 
 well over fifty years in Benwell.     
   Most of the people said that they   
 preferred Benwell to the previous     
 areas of Newcastle that they had      
 lived in. Almost half of the people   
 live in{flats}which are either multi  
 storeyed or two storeyed early 20th.  
 century flats.                        
   Many houses have{front gardens}but  
 in many areas they are uncared for and
 abandoned. The people who owned the   
 untidiest gardens tended to complain  
 the most that the area was run-down.
