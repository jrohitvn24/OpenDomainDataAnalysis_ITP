		<title>13HIGHAM FERRERS LIBRARY</title>
		<content>The Library is a very quiet place to   
choose and to read a book. The Library 
is quite an old building with a new    
extension and modern equipment.        
                                       
During a weekday the Library is visited
by old age pensioners who enjoy the    
peaceful setting as they sit and read  
the newspapers. Sometimes very young   
children come in with their mums to    
choose their first reading books. As   
school children leave their lessons    
for the day many head to the Library   
to get information for their homework. 
Saturday is the busiest day for the    
Library as the whole family choose     
their books.                           
                                       
Most children enjoy Science Fiction    
books. Enid Blyton and Ronald Dahl are 
the most popular authors in Higham     
Ferrers.                               </content>
