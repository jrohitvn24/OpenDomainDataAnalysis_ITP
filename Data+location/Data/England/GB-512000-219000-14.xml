 When I got to Chiltern Hall I thought 
 it was just a pile of stones and wood,
 but then I thought in a few years time
 it would fall down and would be       
 forgotten. There is no glass in the   
 windows and in some rooms it has no   
 floor. There are not any stairs and   
 there are lots of holes in the roof   
 and walls. It used to be a farmhouse, 
 it has been vandalised as well. You   
 can tell it has been vandalised       
 because the doors are off. The doors  
 havent been taken away,they are just  
 lying on the floor. In the corridor   
 there are lots of bricks, floorboards 
 and plaster from the roof. It is so   
 deep you can hardly move from room to 
 room.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
