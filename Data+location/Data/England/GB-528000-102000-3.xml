 The Royal Pavilion is the most        
 important historical building in      
 Brighton.Building began on the        
 pavilion in the late 18th century and 
 was finished early in the 19th century
 ,for who was then George,the Prince of
 Wales (he was Prince Regent 1810-20   
 and King George IV 1820-30).          
    The principal architects were Henry
 Holland and John Nash.The style of the
 building is approximately Indian on   
 the outside and Chinese on the        
 inside,with many Regency features as  
 well.It is a unique blend of          
 contrasting styles of architecture    
 which people which people often love  
 or hate.                              
    The Prince Regent loved it,but     
 Queen Victoria loathed it.She sold it 
 to Brighton Town Council in 1850,so it
 now belongs to the people of Brighton.</content>
