		<title>15REDBOURN'S LAST 40 YEARS</title>
		<content>  {40}years ago Redbourn was a small   
   farming village with a population   
   of about{3,500}people.Many of the   
   buildings which are in the village  
   now did not exist then,especially   
   the housing estate on the west      
   side of the village.                
      The area around the{High Street, 
  {Common and Church End}were the only 
   places people lived.                
      There was no{M1 Motorway}or      
  {by_pass}in those days.The High      
   Street was much busier and the      
  {Railway}carried passengers.         
     Redbourn had many Pubs but some   
   were being altered into other       
   buildings.Many farms have been      
   sold to build houses on.            
      {1953}is one year that really    
   sticks out in the last{40}years.    
   This was the year of the{Queen's    
{  Coronation}.                        </content>
