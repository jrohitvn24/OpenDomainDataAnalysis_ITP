		<content> Many people in this area use the      
 sheeps fleece for making wool either  
 for knitting or weaving. A lady called
 Mrs Hutchings came to school to teach 
 us about dying, spinning and weaving  
 the wool.  She used all sorts of      
 flowers, leaves and herbs to get the  
 different colours for the dyes. They  
 made some lovely shades of green,pink 
 and yellow. After the wool has been   
 dyed,the next stage is spinning. This 
 is best done with a spinning wheel. It
 is quite difficult to learn how to use
 the treadle.  When the wool has been  
 spun, it can been wound into skeins or
 balls and then it is ready for weaving
 or knitting.
