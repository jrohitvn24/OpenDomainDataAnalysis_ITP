		<title>09Forest Museum,Cannock Chase</title>
		<content> This small museum at Ladyhill has a   
range of exhibits covering the history 
of Cannock Chase and forester's work.  
 The past use of the woodland is       
shown in diagrams and photographs. The 
3 main uses were as a hunting ground,  
for charcoal burning for iron smelting 
and as an area for grazing sheep.      
 The planting and harvesting of trees  
in the present day is shown in a range 
of photographs. There is a life-sized  
model with clothing and various tools  
that are used. These include tools     
used for planting, marking trees,      
felling and cutting timber into planks.
 The other uses of timber outlined     
are its use for pit props, fencing,    
trellises, wooden panels etc.          
 There is also a display showing the   
varieties of trees to be found on the  
Chase, and some of the wildlife, both  
harmful and beneficial to the trees.   </content>
