		<title>10The Stafforshire Way</title>
		<content>  Starting at the National Trust land  
surrounding the Castle, is a footpath  
that stretches down through the county.
Eventually it will go the whole length.
It starts at the Castle and then       
crosses the road to the 'Old Man of    
Mow', a solitary pillar of rock left by
the quarrymen. From here it it travels 
to the north east following the ridge  
that lies between Mow Cop and Congleton
Edge. Near the top right of this block 
the footpath descends down towards     
Marsh Green and Biddulph.              
  Way walking is a popular past-time   
and the number of long distance        
footpaths are increasing as time       
passes.                                
  There are splendid views both north  
over Cheshire and south over the       
Potteries.
