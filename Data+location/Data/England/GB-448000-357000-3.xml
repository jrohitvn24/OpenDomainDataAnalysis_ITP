		<content>   Although the majority of people     
 probably spend much of their leisure  
 time watching television,there are a  
 number of local entertainments such as
 the public houses and clubs which are 
 open in normal licensing hours,and    
 local football teams to watch on      
 Saturday afternoons.There are two     
 amusement arcades frequented by the   
 young.In Sutton there is  a banqueting
 suite which can be hired for          
 dinner-dances,discos,meetings etc.    
   Fairs come to Sutton twice a year   
 and are held on the Lammas,as is an   
 annual circus.The Ashfield show and a 
 Bonfire Night firework display are    
 annual events held on Sutton Lawn.    
   Within the Sutton Centre complex is 
 a small theatre where local amateur   
 dramatic groups regularly perform.
