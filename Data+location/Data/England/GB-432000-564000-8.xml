		<title>08TRANSPORT IN SOUTH TYNESIDE</title>
		<content> In Jarrow there is an important Bus   
 terminal.Most buses which travel      
 through the town go to the bus        
 station.However,the Metro is the most 
 important transport system in South   
 Tyneside.The taxi ranks and the bus   
 station are beside the Metro          
 station.Metros are the quickest means 
 of getting around Tyneside.Buses cost 
 the same but take much longer.There   
 are two buses which go through the    
 Tyne Tunnel.They are the 310 and 319  
 services.The 310 goes to Blyth from   
 Sunderland via Jarrow and the 319 goes
 to Cramlington from Sunderland via    
 Jarrow.The Metro System is the most   
 regular means of transport,calling at 
 Metro stations in South Tyneside every
 ten minutes
