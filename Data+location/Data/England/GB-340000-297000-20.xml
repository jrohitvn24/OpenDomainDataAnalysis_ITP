		<title>20LOWER DARNFORD BEECH TREE</title>
		<content> In the centre of the gathering of     
 trees stands a Beech tree,with smooth 
 grey bark.In the roots there is a     
 water trap where gases float up.Lichen
 is growing on the tree and moss grows 
 in the cracks.Around the other side is
 a{dead field mouse}we all think an owl
 caught it.By the water trap is an owl 
 pellet and owl droppings.There are    
 lots of insects living in and around  
 the tree and spiders have spun webs in
 the cracks of the roots.We picked up a
 stone and found a{millipede}which was 
 orange coloured.The girth of the tree 
 was 3.75m and the longest root showing
 above ground was 6.20m.In the bark of 
 the tree someone had carved 1853.
