		<content>         The agricultural land has     
 traditionally been nursey land of high
 quality with Knaphill nursery giving  
 its name to many varieties of         
 Rhododendrons,azaleas and the famous  
 Jackman Clematis.The remaining        
 agricultural land is often used for   
 grazing,particularly rough grazing for
 horses at livery.                     
                                       
         The common land in the area   
 was originally owned by the Earl of   
 Onslow who sold it to the Trustees of 
 the Horsell Common Preservation       
 Society, who manage it as a public    
 open space.                           
                                       
         Large areas are open heath    
 land which is maintained as a         
 heathland habitat and as a site of    
 special scientific interest for       
 Lepidoptera.                          </content>
