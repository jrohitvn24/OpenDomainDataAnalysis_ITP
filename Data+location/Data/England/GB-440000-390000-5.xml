		<content>{Environmental Health in Rotherham.    
  The role of the department has come a
 long way since the "nuisance" man.    
 Volumes of legislation ensure the     
 protection and general welfare of the 
 town's residents. Areas of            
 responsibility are housing, pollution,
 food hygiene and health and safety.   
 Advice is give to householders on     
 statutory nuisances, and grants are   
 given for housing repairs and         
 modernisation. The bi-products from   
 local manufacturing industries are    
 monitored and smokeless zones ensure  
 that the air is clean. Checks are made
 for the levels of asbestos, lead and  
 acid rain. The pest control team      
 handle 3,000 requests annually,       
 dealing with disease carrying insects 
 and vermin. In recent years Rotherham 
 spearheaded the pollen/hayfever       
 bureau.                               </content>
