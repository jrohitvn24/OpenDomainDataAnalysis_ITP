		<content>{Education}for all children in England 
 is both free and compulsory.          
 In the Southampton area children begin
 their education at{First Schools}when 
 they are 5 years old.                 
 When a child is eight years old it    
 moves to a{Middle School}for a higher 
 grade of education and when the child 
 is between 12 and 13 it moves to an   
{Upper School}until it is at least 16. 
 But outside the Southampton area, yet 
 still in Hampshire, the child begins  
 its education at an Infant school at 5
 and leaves to continue at a Junior    
 School at 7.It leaves the Primary     
 sector at II and then finishes its    
 education at a secondary school.      
 Parts of this area are in Southampton 
 (Mansbridge etc.), and parts in       
 Hampshire County (West End etc.) so   
 both education systems operate!
