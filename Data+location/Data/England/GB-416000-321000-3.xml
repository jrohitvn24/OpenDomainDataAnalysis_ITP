		<title>03Rangemore Primary School</title>
		<content>   The school I go to was built in 1873
 and extended in 1966. It is called{All
{Saints C.E.(C) Primary School}and     
 children from Rangemore, Tatenhill and
 Needwood come to it.                  
   Those who live nearby can walk or   
 come by car, but 28 children come on  
 the school bus.                       
   There are 3 classes in the school,  
 which has{29 Infants}(5-7 years),{22  
{Lower Juniors}(7-9 years), and{24     
{Upper Juniors}(9-11 years). There are 
 3 full-time teachers and a part-time  
 teacher. An ancillary helps and is    
 school secretary also.                
   We can stay for school dinners      
 prepared in the kitchen by cook and 3 
 lady helpers. A cleaner-in-charge     
 keeps our school clean.               
   Our headteacher lives in the{School 
{House}next to the school.
