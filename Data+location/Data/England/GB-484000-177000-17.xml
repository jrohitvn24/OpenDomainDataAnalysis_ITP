  {Ockwells Manor Home Farm.}For our   
   Domesday Project we phoned up a farm
   called Ockwells Manor home farm to  
   ask some questions. We asked what   
   crops they grow and they said it was
   not a farm any more just a house.   
  {Foxley Farm.}Foxley Farm has not    
   many animals. They keep one calf    
   and some cattle they have no pigs,  
   poultry or sheep.                   
   Foxley farm has 15 tractors and one 
   combine havester.                   
   There are 60 helpers on the farm not
   including the owner.Farming has been
   in their family for 100 years.      
   The farmers favourite aspect of     
   farming is the serious side of it.  
   For crops they grow veg and wheat.
