		<title>08Mattishall Anglican Churches</title>
		<content> Mattishall Church stands proud at the 
 centre of the township of Mattishall. 
 It must have been the focal point for 
 much of the life of the parish from   
 Saxon times onwards.                  
     The two Mattishall churches       
 provide an interesting contrast that  
 is typical of many in East Anglia.    
 Mattishall Burgh Church has,apart from
 the northern chapel,the simpler plan  
 of the little modified thirteenth     
 century church:it has no architectural
 evidence of having had Saxon or Norman
 phases in its construction.Mattishall 
 Church is a fine example of that group
 of churches that was rebuilt in the   
 fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.   
    In the Domesday Book of 1086 there 
 is only one church recorded in        
 Mattishall.Whilst this does not       
 disprove the existence of a second,it 
 does prove that one existed then.     </content>
