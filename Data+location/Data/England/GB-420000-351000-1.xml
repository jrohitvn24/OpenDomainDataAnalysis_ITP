		<content> This rural area lies midway between   
 Wirksworth and Ashbourne, just outside
 the Peak District National Park.  The 
 land surface lies between 180 metres  
 and 276 metres above sea level, and is
 bisected by Havenhill Dale Brook.     
 It is predominantly a farming area,   
 where most of the land is enclosed and
 is used for sheep and dairy farming.  
 The farms are scattered.  The village 
 of Bradbourne undoubtedly provided a  
 social centre in the past, but        
 increased mobility has meant that the 
 village has become progressively less 
 important for local inhabitants.      
 Houses in the village are being bought
 up by commuters and holiday-makers,   
 and the area's character is changing  
 as a result of this.                  
 The area is unspoilt by industrial    
 development. Its limestone hills and  
 dales make it very beautiful.         </content>
