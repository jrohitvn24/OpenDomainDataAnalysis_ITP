		<title>10THE CROWN INN AYMESTREY</title>
		<content>  The Crown Inn is an{Elizabethan      
 coaching inn with additions being made
 in{Victorian}times. It is a black and 
 white building typical of the area and
 stands by the bridge over the River   
 Lugg. Behind the Crown is levelled    
 ground in the hillside creating an    
 outdoor amphitheatre.  This used to be
 known as{'Monk's Bowling Green'}but is
 now used for outdoor concerts as the  
 monks apparently decided to build     
 their monastery at nearby Wigmore.    
   The Inn  offers{Bed and Breakfast   
 accommodation with a{restaurant       
 serving meals and snacks daily and    
 excellent family{Sunday lunches.      
 Thirsty locals use the inn to gather  
 of an evening and discuss their 'ship'
 (sheep) and the plight of the farming 
 industry but travellers are always    
 made welcome. The Inn boasts a lady   
{ghost}seen by several sober villagers.</content>
