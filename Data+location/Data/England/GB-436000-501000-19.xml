		<title>19WELBURY WOMEN'S EMPLOYMENT</title>
		<content> Living in a small village presents    
 problems for women who have children  
 and who also wish to                  
 work.Opportunities for employment     
 within the village are limited        
 although some wives keep the accounts 
 for self-employed family businesses,  
  help on the family farm or do        
 domestic work.There is one full time  
 female farmer.The use of home         
 computers has recently allowed women  
 to undertake computer work from       
 home.Women without children or with   
 older children follow careers outside 
 the village whereas those with young  
 children favour part-time work or work
 from home.To work outside the village 
 personal transport is neccessary and  
 running costs must be set against     
 remuneration.Despite difficulties some
 of the jobs are:teaching,local govt., 
 physicist,secretarial,shop work,health</content>
