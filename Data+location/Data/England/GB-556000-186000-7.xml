		<content> Most{JUNIOR SCHOOL}children walk to   
 local schools,stay to lunch and return
 home to watch T.V. before evening     
 meal.With a shortage of first-time-   
 buyer homes,relatively few young      
 families are moving into Upminster    
 and with low birth rates junior school
 numbers are down for the time being.  
{SECONDARY SCHOOLS}are full due to the 
 increased number of pupils coming from
 beyond Upminster.Older pupils gain    
 better than national average exam     
 results and spend considerable time   
 watching T.V.,listening to music,     
 using computers,participating in      
 sports and going out with friends.    
 Many have part-time jobs at the       
 weekend.                              
 The"traditional"family home still     
 prevails although one parent families,
 rising unemployment and dual wage     
 earning are becoming more common.     </content>
