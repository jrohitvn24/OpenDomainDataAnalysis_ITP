		<content> The crowd begins to sing the{National 
{Anthem.}Then the{ball}is thrown up.   
 Everybody gets pushed around.It gets  
 hot and sweaty as people crowd        
 together.You can not see very well    
 because there are so many people.It is
 very frightening especially if you are
 at the back of the   hug.You sometimes
 get squashed up to the wall.When      
 everyone else begins to run we run    
 too.There is alot of shouting and     
 screaming.Sometimes funny things      
 happen like a man was running with the
{ball}he tripped over a stone and the  
 went rolling out of his arms as he    
 fell flat on his face.One man was also
 pushed into the river and swallowed   
 alot of dirty water,he grew very ill. 
 There are some sad things that happen 
 too like a man got trampled on in the 
 water he was ill for a while.Many     
 people get{injured}at{Shrovetide.     </content>
