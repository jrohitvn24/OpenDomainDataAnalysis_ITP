		<content> There were no water taps and the      
 toilets were holes in the ground.There
 was no electricity.They had to bring  
 their own food.Children did not have  
 to go to school  until the 1870's,but 
 then they had to stay until they  were
 twelve.After that they went to        
 work.They also went to sunday school. 
 Mrs.Mead used to go to this school in 
 1913 and she gave us a lot of         
 imformation.
