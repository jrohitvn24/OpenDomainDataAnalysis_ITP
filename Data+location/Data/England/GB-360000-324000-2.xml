		<title>02DAIRY FARMING.  1</title>
		<content> Dairy Farming is very popular in      
 Shropshire. The breed of cows most    
 usually milked nowdays is the         
{Friesian.                             
  The cows are milked in parlours.     
 Shippons, where each cow had its own  
 stall, are almost non-existant. In    
 parlours,the cowman stands in a pit in
 the centre and the cows come and stand
 each side of him, between five and    
 twelve at a time. They are usually    
 milked twice a day, sometimes three   
 times. They graze the fields in       
 summer, but in the winter are kept    
 inside and fed winter fodder.         
 This can be{silage,}made from grass   
 or maize, hay or straw, with several  
 different compounds fed to them as    
 well. A tanker collects the milk from 
 the farm's bulk milk tank once a day  
 and takes it to the creamery.
