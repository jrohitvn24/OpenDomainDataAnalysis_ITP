		<content> The block lies in South Shropshire,   
 east of Ludlow and west of Cleobury   
 Mortimer It is on the eastern slope of
 Titterstone Clee Hill  whose highest  
 point  is 533m. Our block falls from a
 height of 457m to 150m in the South   
 east corner at Hopton Brook. The area 
 divides naturally into two regions    
 Land lying above 300m is chiefly      
 open-common land grazed by free       
 ranging sheep and cattle; dotted by   
 disused tips and quarries where coal, 
 iron and stone have been extracted in 
 former times.                         
 The lower land is enclosed in small   
 fields and is chiefly used as pasture 
 land.                                 
 There are three small villages,       
 Hopton Wafers in the valley and       
 Doddington and Cleeton st Mary further
 up the hill. There are clusters of    
 houses at Crumps Brook and Hopton Bank</content>
