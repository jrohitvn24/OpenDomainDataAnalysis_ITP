		<title>06HOUSING - SULLINGTON</title>
		<content> Housing in the Sullington area is very
 scattered and varies from ancient     
 stone and flint cottages, through     
 Georgian and Victorian buildings, to  
 modern brick built houses.  The       
 majority are owner occupied with large
 attractive gardens.  There are a      
 number of farmhouses, but few tied    
 cottages.  Several of the older       
 properties are said to have been      
 connected with the smuggling trade of 
 the last century.  Others, such as the
 limeburners' cottages, have been      
 converted to large private residences.
 Part of the Council housing estates of
 Meadowside and Postview encroach on   
 the Northern boundary of this area.
