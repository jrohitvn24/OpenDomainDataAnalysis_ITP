		<content> The original School building is       
 Victorian and a stone tablet gives the
 date as 1849.It was probably one large
 room with smaller rooms at the rear.  
 The school has seen many changes.The  
 origanal building was converted to a  
 kitchen and boiler house,and staff    
 offices and newer classrooms have been
 added during the last twenty years.The
 present school has five classrooms,a  
 hall,headteacher's room and staffroom.
 It also has a large playing field.The 
 school roll now stands at one hundred.
 About half of the children come from  
 the immediate village and the other   
 half from R.A.F. Swinderby which is   
 situated about three miles away.R.A.F.
 children travel to school by bus.     
 Children usually start school just    
 before their fifth birthday and leave 
 after their eleventh birthday.
