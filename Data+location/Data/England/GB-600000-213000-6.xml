		<title>06THE STROOD WEST MERSEA.</title>
		<content> The strood is a road.It is the only   
 way on and off Mersea island.This road
 can get flooded by the estuary water  
 so we have to have a tide timetable   
 because we could get stuck on the     
 island Sometimes,the tide gets quite  
 high.Buses and lorries can get over   
 quite easily.Quite a lot of people go 
 water skiing in the Strood Channel    
 beside the road.There are many        
 superstitions about the Strood.One of 
 which concerns a Roman centurion who  
 was stationed on the island after the 
 Roman invasion. It is said that his   
 ghost walks the Strood at midnight    
 after he suffered an untimely death.
