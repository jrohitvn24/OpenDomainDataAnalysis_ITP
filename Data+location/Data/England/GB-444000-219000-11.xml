		<title>11THE FAIR</title>
		<content> The fair comes to Tackley evry year in
 the middle of July.  It sets up on the
 Recreation Ground.  There is not a    
 great deal at the fair now.  Last year
 there were Swingboats and the         
 Gallopers but two of the people who   
 used to run the fair have died since  
 then so there is not so much this     
 year.  A person got killed on the     
 swingboats so that is why they are not
 here.  The best thing is the Satellite
 which is round and has 20 seats. It   
 costs 30p. and a ride lasts about 5   
 minutes.  There will also be Bumper   
 cars, shooting ranges and hot-dog,    
 candy-floss and toffee-apple stalls.  
 I shall take Â£2.50 to the fair.
