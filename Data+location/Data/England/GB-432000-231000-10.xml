		<content>There is only one sheep farm owned by  
Mr Peploe. He has no workers. He owns  
about 150 acres. He has 200 ewes and   
lambs and 4 rams. He sells his wool to 
Perce of Tame. His sheep are born in   
March and he keeps them about 4 months 
before they go to market. Mr Peploe has
lived on the farm for 3 years. He came 
from Cumberland. He has 3 tractors and 
some machinery for cutting his crops.  
His sheep are grey faced ewes crossed  
with black faced ewes and border       
Leicesters. If a ewe has more than 2   
lambs they swop all the sheep around.  
Rollright Heath Farm is family owned.  
They have 600 acres,mainly in cereals  
and horticulture. They grow crops like 
brussel sprouls,leeks,beans and        
onions which they take to the markets  
in London and Birmingham. They employ  
17 men permanently and more seasonally.
