		<title>10New Forest-Felling Conifers1</title>
		<content> The yield of conifers from the whole  
 New Forest is approximately 35000 tons
 per annum. There are three types of   
 product derived from the felling of   
 conifers or softwood trees.           
 1.{Logs from 6-16 cms}diameter are    
 sent to pulp mills. At present those  
 in Sweden are being used as this is   
 the most economical. The pulp is then 
 returned to paper mills in the U.K.   
 However this arrangement may change   
 next year.                            
 2.{Short logs from 16-30 cms}diameter 
 are cut by the foresters to specified 
 lengths and go to local mills to be   
 made into planking, fencing material, 
 chips (for all weather horse gallops) 
 and carcassing. For example a mill at 
 Cadnam makes up boxes which are filled
 with liquid latex at Fawley           
 petrochemical industry and then sent  
 to Japan.                    {Cont>   </content>
