		<title>01Whitfield Estate</title>
		<content> About one third of the area is covered
 with woodland, mostly deciduous but   
 with some coniferous plantations, the 
 remainder being mixed agriculture     
 including sheep, beef and dairy cattle
 and a wide variety of agricultural    
 crops. The area is largely flat but   
 with some gentle slopes. Most of the  
 area is is owned by a large           
 agricultural estate, the Whitfield    
 estate. Much of it is farmed and      
 managed by the owners with some being 
 occupied by tenant farmers. Whitifeld 
 house stands in extesive park land and
 is approached by several miles of     
 private roads from 3 directions. The  
 population is evenly scattered        
 thoughout the area and includes       
 farmers, farm workers estate and      
 woodland workers, but the majority    
 have employment outside the area,     
 mostly in nearby Hereford.            </content>
