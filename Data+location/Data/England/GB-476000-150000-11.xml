		<title>11BASINGSTOKE CANAL</title>
		<content> The Basingstoke Canal was completed in
 1793 to provide a transport route to  
 London via the Rivers Wey and Thames, 
 but became derelict when better roads 
 and the railway were built. Surrey and
 Hants Canal Society started           
 restoration in 1974 after these County
 Councils had purchased the land. The  
 existing canal was built to give a    
 bottom width of 38ft and 6ft depth,   
 but dredging has only been to 29ft and
 4ft6ins in order to preserve the      
 unique habitat. The towpath has been  
 cleared and the brick-arched bridges  
 repaired. The narrow boat, JOHN       
 PINKERTON, takes 56 passengers on     
 canal trips. Rowing boats can be hired
 and permits are available for private 
 boating and also for fishing.
