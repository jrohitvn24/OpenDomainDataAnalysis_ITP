		<content>  At{Callow's Leap}it is said that a   
 mighty hunter,named Callow,leaped down
 the precipice.Callow's Grave is said  
 to be in the Tenbury neighbourhood.At 
 the former place sights unearthly are 
 seen at night,hideous black dogs      
 running about.                        
  There once was a vicar in Tenbury and
 he was married.His wife annoyed him,so
 he went mad and killed her.He put her 
 in a room and blocked it up.          
  The next people who lived there      
 heard knocks and scratches and cries  
 for help,through the wall.            
  They unblocked it and found a woman's
 skeleton.                             
{ Father Christmas}comes to Tenbury    
 every year.He comes on a sleigh pulled
 by two shire horses.He brings presents
 for every child in the town.Normally  
 the presents are oranges and sweets.
