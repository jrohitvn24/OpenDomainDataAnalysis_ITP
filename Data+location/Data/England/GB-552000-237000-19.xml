 Two years ago a new Leisure centre    
 opened in Saffron Walden. It is called
 the Lord Butler Leisure Centre after  
 R.A. Butler who was M.P. for the town.
 There is a large 25m swimming pool    
 with squash courts, tennis courts,    
 basketball, saunas, solarium a bar and
 a cafeteria. It is also used by a     
 playgroup for pre-school children.    
                                       
 The new centre became necessary when  
 it was found that the River Slade     
 which flows beneath Saffron Walden had
 eroded the ground beneath the old     
 swimming pool which was in the town   
 centre. The new centre is a mile out  
 of town.
