		<content>  One of the occupations in the village
 is  pig  farming.  This  usually  only
 employs  people from the farmer's  own
 family.                               
  Pig  farming   has   had  a  somewhat
 precarious existence in  recent years.
 One of the  problems  confronting  the
 industry  is that of producing  a  pig
 which  meets  with  market demands, at
 present  calling  for  a  lean  animal
 rather than the fat pig  of some years
 ago. The current trend is  the  result
 of the  move against eating animal fat
 on  health  grounds.                  
  Another problem is the  price  of the
 pig set against the price of the feed.
 The arable farmer wants  a  high price
 for  his  cereals  but the  pig farmer
 wants  a  low  price  for   his  feed,
 these two are difficult to reconcile. 
  The present price is 102pence/kg. for
 fat pigs and Â£138/tonne for the feed. </content>
