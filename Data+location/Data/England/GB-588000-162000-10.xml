		<title>10TRAFFIC IN SITTINGBOURNE</title>
		<content> The council recently built a new      
 roundabout on the A2 East of town.We  
 questioned 21 people at the round-    
 about,and most of them thought it was 
 dangerous,and wanted to               
 start again.Everyone said there were  
 more traffic jams at rush-hours.Quite 
 a lot of people disliked the new      
 one-way system in East Street because 
 only buses can go both ways,emergency 
 vehicles have to take a longer route, 
 and shops had lost trade.The          
 pedestrian crossings are also in      
 dangerous positions.The council are   
 planning changes in the near future.We
 did a mid-morning traffic survey to   
 count vehicles turning from the       
 roundabout into South Avenue.In 1 hour
 25 minutes there were 462 cars,62     
 vans,25 lorries,23 bikes, 18 motor-   
 bikes,6 buses,and 14 other vehicles.  
{Total 610. 4.8 vehicles a minute.     </content>
