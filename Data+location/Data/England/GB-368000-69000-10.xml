		<title>10The Royal Manor School</title>
		<content> The schools in the Weymouth and South 
 Dorset area underwent reorganisation  
 with effect from 1st September 1985.  
 Until that time Portland was served by
 one senior school for 600 pupils,     
 Portland Secondary, with some children
 travelling daily to Weymouth to attend
 the Grammar School. With              
 reorganisation came the Royal Manor   
 Comprehensive School built to         
 accommodate over 700 pupils.  The     
 Royal Manor School has many new       
 buildings including an excellent      
 sports hall, drama studio, library and
 purpose built music rooms and typing  
 room.  The old school building has    
 been adapted to house new science     
 laboratories and workshops for the    
 Technical Studies department.
