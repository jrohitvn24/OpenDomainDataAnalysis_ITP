   Sometimes on the field we play leap 
 frog.we play running races,cartwheels 
 and football.We play bulldog and we   
 play star wars and secret wars,we play
 Bruce Lee games.Star Wars is an outer 
 space adventure.In it you have to     
 fight Darth Vader and his             
 stormtroopers.Secret wars is about    
 Spiderman and Supermanand and Dr Doom.
 Bruce Lee is a famous martial arts    
 teacher.Kerry likes playing babies.   
 This is when somebody pretends to be  
 the mum and baby.Sometimes we play    
 follow my leader,it means that you    
 copy the person in front of you.      
 Sometimes we play on the bars and do  
 one hander two hander,that is when you
 swing with one hand or two hands.When 
 the boys fight they get sent to stand 
 by the wall.                          </content>
