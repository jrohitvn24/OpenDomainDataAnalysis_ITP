		<title>02Little Addington House 1985</title>
		<content>    The house used to be called Little 
Addington Parsonage House.The newest   
part of the house is the honey-room and
the owner,who is a bee-keeper,makes    
honey.A couple of years ago, the old   
larder was made into a toilet for many 
reasons!                               
    The house was built in 1862 and the
Rev. A Boodle drew the plans for the   
house.In 1920 the house was owned by Mr
Conyers,a leather merchant,who worked  
in Leeds. In 1928 Mr. Conyers retired, 
left the house and went to Raunds.Mr   
Cork lived there for a while but from  
1928 to 1930 the house was empty.      
    In 1938,the present owner bought   
the house from the ecclesiastical      
commissioners of England.The house has 
its own water supply by way of a pump  
so there is no problem in a drought.
