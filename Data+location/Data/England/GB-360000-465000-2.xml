		<title>02The village of Wray</title>
		<content> Wray may have been settled by the     
 Norsemen.Its name means "an out of    
 the way corner", which in some ways it
 still is, with its cobbles, and       
 architecture which dates back to Tudor
 and Jacobean times. Wray looks like a 
 sleepy village from the past but it   
 lives very much for today.            
 In August 1967, the River Roeburn     
 flooded, tearing down bridges, walls, 
 cottages and trees. A scattering of   
 new houses now replaces those         
 destroyed.                            
 The main industry is farming and only 
 two shops remain in a village which   
 was once alive with millworkers and   
 traders.                              
 There is also a school, church and    
 chapel, Institute, and two public     
 houses.                               
                                       
                                       </content>
