   {QUARRIES OF HARLESTONE}            
  There was at one time numerous       
quarries,the sandstone,freestone rock  
being used to construct local          
buildings.The stone became harder the  
deeper it lay and contained ferruginous
streaks known by locals as the "masons 
bankrupter" since it wore out tools    
very quickly.This was a popular stone  
with northern housewives as they used  
it for sanding doorsteps(called donkey 
stones).                               
  Near to the Manor House is the site  
of quarries which date back more than  
three hundred years(known as the hills 
and hollows).                          
  A disused quarry used as a tip for   
village refuse is almost full.         
  The only quarry remaining in use is  
used at present to store materials for 
motorway maintenance.                  </content>
