		<content> For a small village 3 pubs might seem 
 excessive. Tourists and Cavers however
 offer the demand that supports them.  
 The Hunters Lodge is about a mile east
 of the village centre. A meeting place
 for cavers from all over the world. A 
 Free House with a good selection of   
 real ales.                            
 The New Inn is situated oppoite the   
 green. It has 2 bars, a restaurant and
 a small beer garden.                  
 The Queen Victoria Inn is also close  
 to the green. One large bar and a     
 large beer garden which was built in  
 1982. A picnic area is provided but   
 you mustn't take your own drinks|
