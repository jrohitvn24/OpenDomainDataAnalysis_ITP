		<title>19CAPT. OWEN, HELICOPTER PILOT</title>
		<content> The Owen's came to Goxhill 2 years ago
 when Humberside Airport, Kirmington,  
 began to be used as a helicopter base 
 flying equipment and men to gas rigs. 
 These are 17 miles off the North      
 Humberside coast. Capt. Owen flies his
 British Airways helicopter out to the 
 rigs at 1000 ft. and back at 2000 ft. 
 He learned to fly fixed wing aircraft 
 before changing to helicopters. His   
 job has taken him around the world and
 he often has special charter work,    
 e.g. taking business men on business  
 trips; taking oil tycoons and friends 
 to the Grand Prix and similar events. 
 Last year he flew the Prime Ministers 
 of the Western Nations when a summit  
 meeting was held in London. Capt. Owen
 is trained in air sea rescue and wears
 a survival suit when over water in    
 winter. He flies Father Christmas to  
 Christmas Parties each year.          </content>
