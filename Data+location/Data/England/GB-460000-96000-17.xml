		<title>17ALVERSTOKE</title>
		<content>      Most of the housing in Alverstoke
 village is old and some are "listed   
 buildings".  In the village centre    
 most of the accomodation is above the 
 shops.                                
      Elderly people like to live in   
 the real village because it is quiet  
 and the shops so old-fashioned and    
 neat. There are about 15 shops        
 altogether,including food shops, an   
 antique shop,post office and bank.    
 Although Alverstoke is a suburb of    
 Gosport,the residents like to think   
 of it as a separate place.  Almost all
 the residents of Alverstoke work in   
 either Gosport,Fareham or Portsmouth. 
      Being an old village,the streets 
 were not designed to carry much       
 traffic and the roads are often       
 congested.
