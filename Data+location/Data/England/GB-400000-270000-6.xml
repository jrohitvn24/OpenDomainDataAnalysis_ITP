		<title>06Farming in Alvechurch</title>
		<content>   One of the farms in Alvechurch is   
 called "Lea End". We talked to Mr     
 Bushell the farmer. He was born in the
 village and went to the old school on 
 the hill. He then went to Barnt Green 
 and came back to live at the farm for 
 55 years. In 1979 he had to move out  
 because of the motorway, and his land 
 was required for its construction. His
 first reactions were anger and        
 frustration. His farm was mainly      
 arable, but the animals went first as 
 the farm was sold. On the 1st August  
 1985 the remaining buildings and      
 machinery will be auctioned. Other    
 local farmers have suffered in a      
 similar way as Mr Bushell as the M42  
 moves nearer the village.
