		<title>02My Dad Works As .......</title>
		<content>    My dad is a lecturer in Technical  
 Drawing and Engineering at the        
 Soundwell Technical College,Bristol.  
 It is a round journey of about sixty  
 miles but he does not mind this.The   
 college has up to date equipment and  
 modern buildings.Sometimes he has to  
 work in the evenings.In his spare time
 he is a photographer.                 
    My dad works in a Watts Tyre       
 factory in Lydney.It makes tyres and  
 false bottoms for containers.His job  
 is making bottoms for gas cylinders.It
 is very hot there because of an       
 incinerator used to melt polyurethene.
    My dad works as a self-employed    
 firm called Severnside Damproofing.He 
 goes around giving buildings          
 protection against damp and also does 
 woodworm treatment.He travels and     
 carries his equipment in a van.
