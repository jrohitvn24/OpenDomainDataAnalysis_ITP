		<content> Laxton plays a unique part in the     
 local history of Nottinghamshire and  
 Britain.                              
 The village of Laxton is mostly owned 
 by the Crown Commissioners and the    
 farmers are all tenants.  This is in  
 order to preserve the unique medieval 
 strip-farming system by which there   
 sre three fields which are divided    
 into strips, each farmer being        
 allocated a certain number of strips  
 in each field. The 'Court Leet' is    
 held once a year and the fields are   
 inspected to make sure that each      
 farmer is working his strip correctly,
 fines are levied if he should plough  
 over his limits or commit other       
 misdemeanours.  There is also common  
 land which is used for grazing.  Part 
 of the South Field comes into the area
 studied.                              
                                       </content>
