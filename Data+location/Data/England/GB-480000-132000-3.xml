		<title>03Watermeadows, River Wey.</title>
		<content> Keen members of Bramshott and Liphook 
 Preservation Society explored and     
 mapped this unique system of water    
 meadows, which extend further up and  
 down the river. They interested local 
 authorities and universities and      
 obtained grants for repair work.This  
 led to the designation of the river   
 banks, the unploughed watermeadows and
 their workings as a Conservation Area.
 The County and local councils with    
 this Society have now set up the River
 Wey Trust, nominated trustees and     
 provided grants. A one year scheme    
 1985-6 from the Manpower Services     
 Commission has enlisted an ecologist, 
 an historian, and foreman with 6 young
 unemployed, who are uncovering and    
 studying more of the workings in these
 meadows. They are at work exposing the
 carrier and the old grooved stones of 
 the hatches near Passfield.           </content>
