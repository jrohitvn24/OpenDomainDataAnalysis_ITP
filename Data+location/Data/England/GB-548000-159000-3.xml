		<title>03High Sheriff of Kent 1985</title>
		<content>  {Sir Marc Noble}who lives in the     
 parish came to visit our school. He   
 told us about the history of a        
 sheriff. The{word sheriff comes from  
{two words, Shire and Reeve.}Then he   
 explained what a High Sheriff does    
 today.                                
   A modern sheriff is appointed by the
 Privy Councillors. He keeps the job   
 for twelve months. Next time Kent is  
 to have a lady High Sheriff. No one   
 can ask for the job, you have to be   
 recommended for it and be a good      
 person who lives in the area.         
   When the Queen comes to visit, the  
 High Sheriff has to look after her. If
 an election is held the High Sheriff  
 ensures that everything is done       
 properly, and if a bad person is found
 guilty of treason he must arrange the 
 execution.{A High Sheriff is a very   
{important person in Kent.             </content>
