		<title>17 ARMITAGE SHANKS COMPANY.</title>
		<content>                                       
Armitage Shanks started out as two     
companies, "Armitage Ware" and "Shanks 
and Company" then they became          
"Armitage  Shanks"- it's modern day    
name. They make different types of     
sanitary ware, wash basins, baths,     
toilets, soap and toothbrush holders,  
and shower trays.                      
The factory is sited by the Trent and  
Mersey canal, this was useful at first 
when roads were poor. Materials and    
products were transported by barge.    
The raw materials used in production   
are china and normal clay. After the   
mix has been put in the mould and has  
been "fixed" it is glazed and painted  
My dad is a kiln fireman, he watches   
the kilns and contents to make sure    
everything is alright.                 
The Company has bought a piece of land 
by our school to build a new warehouse </content>
