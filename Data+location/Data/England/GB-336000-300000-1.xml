		<title>01The Area in General.</title>
		<content>   We live in a very hilly area. The   
 main feature of our 12km block is our 
 magnificent hills. Some of them are   
 rocky and steep,but some are gradually
 sloping hills covered in heather,     
 whimberries and gorse.                
   Another feature of our block is the 
{planted}forests. A lot of the forest  
 is planted for timber by the Forestry 
 Commission but some is oak,planted for
 its bark used in the tanning process. 
   The villages of Snailbeach and      
 Stiperstones grew when people found   
 there were rich minerals in this area 
 and mining communities developed.     
   The main type of farming is sheep   
 farming. Most of our land-cover is    
 rough grazing and sheep are the best  
 type of animal to live on it.         
 Some farmers rear cattle for beef but 
 a few farmers rear dairy cows, one    
 being the local milkman.              </content>
