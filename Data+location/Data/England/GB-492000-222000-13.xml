		<title>13A WORKER AT GROVE FARM</title>
		<content>  There are two farm workers at        
 Grovebury Farm and a days work is very
 hard for them. The farm worker has to 
 get up at 6.00 am and starts work at  
 7.00 am. He mainly has to work from 8 
 to 12 hours a day. Maybe longer in the
 summer.                               
  One worker concentrates on           
 maintenance, looking after the        
 machinery and driving the tractors.   
 The machinery they have got to help   
 them do the work are, a combine       
 harvester which is the largest,a chain
 saw, a corn drill and a deisel        
 engine. The machinery is very noisy   
 and not very comfortable.             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
