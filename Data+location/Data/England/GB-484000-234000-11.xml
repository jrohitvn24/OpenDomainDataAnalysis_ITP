		<title>11Origins of Bletchley People</title>
		<content>                                       
   We did a survey on people who lived 
 in our part of Bletchley.             
   We found that most people who live  
 here now have come from other         
 places.Nearly half the people who now 
 live in Bletchley have come here from 
 London,and another quarter come from  
 the Home Counties, only one tenth were
 born here.                            
   Most people had moved from London   
 because they could get a better house 
 here and also it was easier to find a 
 job. They also found that it was      
 better for their children than living 
 in a big town.                        
   Most people had lived in Bletchley  
 for beetween 10 and 30 years and      
 nearly everyone we asked said they    
 liked it here,were glad they moved    
 and wanted to stay here.
