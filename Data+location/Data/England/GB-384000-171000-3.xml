		<content>      The buildings are very much part 
 of the landscape.                     
      Cottages are built of irregular  
 blocks of the local limestone(rubble),
 with mullioned windows of cut Bath    
 stone (freestone).Roofs are of        
 limestone 'slates' graded in size from
 eaves to ridge. A few cottages are    
 thatched.                             
     Modern houses are built from      
 reconstructed Bath stone in order to  
 blend in with the surroundings.       
     Biddestone Green is most          
 attractive with its houses,large and  
 small, the White Horse pub and the    
 duckpond. Pond Farmhouse has a gazebo,
 as has Biddestone Manor,a c17 house   
 with attractive gardens at the edge of
 the village. Hartham Park is another  
 large c18 house in extensive parkland 
 and with a private chapel.
