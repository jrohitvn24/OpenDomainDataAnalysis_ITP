		<title>03PEOPLE'S CONCERNS (Town)</title>
		<content>   There has been a campaign in        
 Wymondham for a swimming pool and     
 Â£29,899 has been raised.The District  
 Council started work on the pool in   
 the High School field but shortly     
 afterwards they stopped and now we    
 don't know how our money is going to  
 be used.                              
   Other prime concerns are the        
 inadequacy of street lighting in the  
 outer areas of the town, withdrawal   
 and re-routing of the bus services due
 to financial constraints, lorries in  
 the narrow roads of the town centre   
 and the narrowness of pavements which 
 is causing problems for mothers,      
 children and old people. There are    
 lobbies for more activities for       
 children; for a B.M.X track and for   
 the town to be tidied up.
