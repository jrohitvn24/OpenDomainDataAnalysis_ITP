		<content>  The land in our squares has the      
villages of Hanbury,Coton in the Clay  
and Fauld.                             
  From the top of Hanbury Hill or from 
the church you can see right across    
the Dove valley.The river Dove is the  
boundary between Staffordshire and     
Derbyshire.We are in Staffordshire.All 
the land is farmland except for the    
Gypsum mines.There is not much for the 
visitor to see or do but to go for     
walks or look at the church.           
  St.Werburgh's church is very old and 
big.There are some interesting         
monuments and stained glass to see.    
  Other interesting buildings to look  
at are the school,Far Fillimore Rest   
Home,The Thatches and New Lodge.New    
Lodge used to be the home of the       
Axebearer of Needwood Forest.It is now 
a private school.
