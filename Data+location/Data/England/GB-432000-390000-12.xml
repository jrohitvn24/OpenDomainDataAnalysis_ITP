		<title>12SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY</title>
		<content> Match days at Hillsborough are usually
 Saturday afternoon or Tuesday         
 evenings; though there have been a few
 Sunday games.                         
 The shops are always packed with      
 football supporters. There's always an
 enormous queue at the newsagents. The 
 supermarkets are better but there     
 are the odd few buying 4-packs of     
 beer. People go to the pub first. Some
 get drunk and start messing about &amp;   
 arguing with shop-keepers. The pubs   
 near the ground are all boarded up.   
 Was all this a reason why fewer people
 go to Wednesday matches these days?   
 The reasons given in our survey were:-
     No interest in football : {15%    
{   }Attend other grounds    :  {9.5%  
{   }Too expensive           : {26.5%  
{   }Poor crowd behaviour    : {40%    
 (The events at Bradford % Heysel came 
 just after our survey began.)         </content>
