		<content> Youlgrave is situated in the Peak     
 District National Park. We have       
 many visitors, especially in the      
 summer. The Youth Hostel in Youlgrave 
 can hold 44 people. Their busiest time
 of the year is welldressing week (at  
 the end of June). People stay at the  
 Youth Hostel to enjoy the countryside 
 and the welldressings.                
 There are 5 camp sites, 3 of which    
 have static caravans. There are 18    
 static caravans at Hopping Farm: an   
 overnight stay costs Â£3. The Caravan  
 Club also has a site at Hopping Farm  
 for touring caravans. Many walkers    
 and cyclists pass through Youlgrave   
 and stop at one of the two local      
 cafes. A growing number of cottages   
 are being bought as holiday homes.    
 Many local people are not pleased with
 this.
