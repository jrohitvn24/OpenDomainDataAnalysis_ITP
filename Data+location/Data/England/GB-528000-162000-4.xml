		<content>This is what it is like to live on the 
Roundshaw Estate by Daniel Simpson,    
Richard Hall and Tracey Ballard;Age 10.
Roundshaw is a very boring estate.     
There is nothing to do but there is a  
lovely girl called Sherneen. We fancy  
her. She lives in a white house on     
Brancker Close. We are careful when we 
are out because there are bullies on   
the estate. Some of the decks are quite
good to live on. We play on the grass  
but there are signs saying "No ball    
games." Lucky people live in the       
country. Our mums would like to live in
a Wimpy house with a garden. At week-  
ends we go to Beddington Park where    
there are fields and a river.
