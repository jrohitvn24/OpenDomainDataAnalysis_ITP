		<title>19The Art Scene, Warbleton</title>
		<content> The Art Scene in 1985 is informal but 
 thriving. There are no organised      
 classes but painting is a popular     
 pastime. Once a year, as part of the  
 Flower Show in July, The work of local
 amateur artists is collected and hung 
 in the Dunn village hall. This year,  
 some 30 men and women submitted nearly
 50 paintings and drawings and 7 were  
 sold. Knowledgeable opinion judges the
 work to be of good quality.           
 The most prolific painters in the     
 village are undoubtedly Mr and Mrs    
 Beckley who paint in water colour and 
 oils respectively. Their subjects are 
 mainly landscapes and still life      
 flower arrangements. Their studio is  
 open to the public at weekends.
