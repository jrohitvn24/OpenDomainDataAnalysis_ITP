		<content> AS PART OF THE DOMESDAY PROJECT,ALL   
 THE FIRST YEARS TOOK PART IN A MUSICAL
 WRITTEN ESPECIALLY FOR THE EVENT BY   
 OUR MUSIC TEACHER, MR. WATERFIELD. IT 
 WAS CALLED "TRING'S OFFSPRING".       
 THE STORY TOLD ABOUT LIFE IN          
 ALTRINCHAM ALONG TIME AGO, AND HOW    
 THERE WAS A BARRIER BETWEEN THE' POSH 
  PEOPLE' AND THE 'ORDINARY PEOPLE'.IT 
 SHOWED HOW AFTER OLD BUILDINGS WERE   
 PULLED DOWN AND MODERN ONES WERE      
 BUILT,PEOPLE BEGAN TO FORGET THEIR    
 DIFFERENCES AND THE OLD BARRIER WAS   
 ALSO PULLED DOWN.                     
 THERE WERE FIVE PARTS TO THE MUSICAL:-

 WERE THE POSH PEOPLE,1MASSEY WERE THE 
 BUILDERS,1 STAMFORD WERE THE PLANNERS 
 AND 1 TATTON WERE THE ORDINARY PEOPLE.
