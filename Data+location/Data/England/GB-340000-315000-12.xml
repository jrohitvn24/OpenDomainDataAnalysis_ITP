		<title>12PARACHUTING AT FORTON</title>
		<content>     Parachuting has taken place at    
 this disused ex-World War II airfield 
 for many years now.  People come from 
 all over the Midlands for a week-end  
 course which costs around Â£50 and     
 leads to the first jump. Subsequent   
 jumps cost around Â£8 each.  Part of a 
 group from Shrewsbury VI College can  
 be seen on the accompanying photograph
 about to take off on their first jump.
     A large number of first timers    
 raise money for charity as a result of
 their exploits - and get their first  
 jump paid for by their sponsors.      
     The more hardened addicts of this 
 fast growing sport can be seen here   
 every week-end that the weather and   
 finances will allow.                  
     Certainly, all who have tried this
 sport reckon it is an experience you  
 will never forget - one way or        
 another!                              </content>
