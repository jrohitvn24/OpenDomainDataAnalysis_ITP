		<title>11EDUCATION IN HASTINGS</title>
		<content>  Most children start full time        
 education when they are 5 when they go
 to their local primary school. Here   
 they will be in a class of about 30   
 children. They will learn a mixture of
 subjects but when they leave at 11    
 they should have skills in language   
 and maths. Then they go to a          
 comprehensive school. There are 4.    
 Each has about 1,400 pupils. All stay 
 till they are 16 and may until they   
 are 18. Two of the schools are mixed, 
 one is all boys and the other all     
 girls. Some young people leave school 
 and take full time courses at Hastings
 college where much of the work is to  
 train for employment. Those wishing to
 study for degrees go to Universities  
 and Polytechnics throughout Britain.
