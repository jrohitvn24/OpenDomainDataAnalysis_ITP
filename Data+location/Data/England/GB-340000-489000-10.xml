		<content> There are several traditional         
{Recreations. Wrestling}has been       
 taking place since Viking times. The  
 combatants dress in a 'uniform' of    
 elaborately embroidered black trunks, 
 white long pants and vest.{Fishing,   
 once a necessity, has become a sport  
 with Salmon and Sea Trout being taken 
 from the River Gilpin, although the   
 quality and quantity of fish has      
 deteriorated due to pollution.Another 
 popular and sometimes necessary sport 
 is{fell fox hunting.}The{Coniston Pack
 stays at local farms for several days 
 controlling the fox population in     
 order to protect the farm stock.      
{Shooting}was once only for live game  
 but in recent years{clay pigeon       
{shooting}has become popular, as has   
{riding.}There is a{livery stable      
 catering for full, part and grass     
 liveries.                             </content>
