		<title>03Trout Fishing,Ravensthorpe</title>
		<content>The reservoir is divided into 2 by the 
causeway giving 2 seperate leisure     
pursuits.The larger eastern area is    
used for trout fishing. In 1984 Anglia 
Water Authority sold the fishing rights
and so it became privately managed for 
the first time since fishing started   
here in 1952.The reservoir is stocked  
with 8000 brown and rainbow trout      
supplied by a hatchery in Arlesford    
Hants. Keen fly fishermen had already  
caught 4000 by June this year.They pay 
6 pounds/day and can take 6 trout home 
if they can catch them.Some hire trout 
boats to increase their chances.Upto   
200 fishermen come per week from as    
far away as London and Birmingham.     
Sometimes large pike weighing upto     
20lb have been caught and these are    
sent to Billingsgate fish market in    
London.Fishing is a very popular       
sport.                                 </content>
