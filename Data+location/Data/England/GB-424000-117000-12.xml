 Palace the C5 was launched. The       
 Sinclair C5 is an electric tricycle   
 with a range of about 20 miles. When  
 the battery runs down after the 20    
 miles you recharge it overnight on the
 mains. That costs around 5p. It isn't 
 completely electrical_it does have    
 pedals to maximise the range. You     
 could call it a mix between a bicycle 
 and an open top car but it's nothing  
 like it. It is 1744mm long, 744mm wide
 and 795mm high. It weighs 30kg without
 battery, has a luggage capacity of    
 28.3l, maximum electric drive speed of
 24km/ph and pneumatic tyres. The      
 steering bars are underneath your     
 thighs and all the controls fall to   
 hand. On the bars you have a power    
 button and brake levers. In front of

 Display' which tells you about your   </content>
