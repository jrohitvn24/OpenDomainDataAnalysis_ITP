 THE MANCHESTER SHEFFIELD AND LINCOLN  
 RAILWAY COMPANY. IT WAS LATER TAKEN   
 OVER BY THE GREAT CENTRAL RAILWAY AND 
 IN 1923 BECAME PART OF THE LONDON AND 
 NORTH EASTERN RAILWAY.IT BECAME PART  
 OF BRITISH RAILWAYS IN 1948. THERE    
 USED TO BE A RAILWAY STATION AT       
 CHEQUER HOUSE BUT THIS WAS CLOSED IN  
 1935 (PASSENGER SIDE) THE GOODS SIDE  
 CONTINUED TO HANDLE LOCALLY GROWN     
 POTATOES SUGAR BEET AND GRAIN UNTIL   
 THE EARLY 1950'S. IN 1958 THE LEVEL   
 CROSSING AT CHEQUER HOUSE WAS REPLACED
 BY A NEW FLY OVER AS PART OF THE      
 RETFORD BY PASS. THE LINE IS MAINLY   
 USED FOR COAL FROM YORKSHIRE EN ROUTE 
 FOR THE TRENT VALLEY POWER STATIONS.  
 EACH TRAIN IS 34 WAGONS EACH CARRYING 
 30 TONS OF COAL. APPROXIMATELY 40 FULL
