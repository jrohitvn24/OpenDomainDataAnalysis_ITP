		<title>07FAMILY LIFE    PLUMSTEAD</title>
		<content>My family is a nice family. I have got 
1 brother and 2 sisters. We might be   
moving soon because my mum might be    
getting married. Sometimes me and my   
sisers row but we like each other      
really. My eldest sister is getting a  
flat soon with her boyfriend. I like   
where we live because I have lots of   
friends. We all go to bed at ten and we
don't mind.We have a bath when we want.
At the moment my dad is in hospital    
because he works on scaffolding and the
gun blew up what he was using.He       
tumbled over the top. As he was falling
he tried to grab on to things but he   
just couldn't grab anything.He had a   
serious accident.I hope he will be     
alright.Anyway, back to my family.We   
have got a cat called Misty,a hamster  
called Pibbles and we are looking after
my aunty's dog called Sowy.We all get  
on together.                           </content>
