		<title>03MANOR FARM BUILDINGS</title>
		<content>   Most of the farm buildings have been
 converted to a house,which is used by 
 the owners at weekends and for        
 holidays.                             
   The{stables}are now used as a place 
 to store garden machinery and tools.  
 The{cowshed}is now a living room and a
 small bedroom.The{lofts}and{barn}have 
 been changed into a kitchen,with a    
 dining-room and bedrooms over the top.
   The windows and doors have also been
 changed and there is a patio,but the  
 owners have tried to keep it looking  
 as it was.                            
   The{granary}and{cartshed}are still  
 unchanged.The stone steps are loose   
 and unsafe.The floorboards have       
 rotted.The walls are still plastered  
 inside.They were plastered so rats    
 and mice couldn't get through gaps    
 between stones to eat the grain.
