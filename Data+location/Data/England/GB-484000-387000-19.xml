  On Shrove Tuesday in 1814 a young    
 girl was ringing the bell in          
 Spingthorpe Church. The cord shot up  
 in the air and she let go. She fell   
 and died. In those days if a girl died
 before she was married her friends    
 made a garland out of paper to hang in
 the church so that people would       
 remember her. The garland looks like a
 paper hat with flowers on it. The     
 garland is now in a glass case near   
 the door. A few years ago they made a 
 new one to hang in the church.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
