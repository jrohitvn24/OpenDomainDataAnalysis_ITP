		<content>The ecology of the area is greatly     
influenced by the abundance of woodland
in the western half and the lack of it 
in the eastern section.Deciduous       
woodland particularly contains a wide  
variety of insects,birds and some      
parasitic plants,all benefitting from  
the less densely packed foliage of     
broad-leaved trees.In the western half,
beech was the most dominant hardwood.  
Ash and sycamore were also in abundance
often growing along roadsides.Willows &amp;
a few very young elms bordered much of 
the R.Churn.In the south west,the      
woodland was virtually all deciduous,  
but further north mixed coniferous and 
deciduous predominated.On the plateau  
area to the east woodland was very     
sparse,some oaks were found in small   
sheltered valleys &amp; stunted hawthorn   
bordered the field boundaries.
