		<content>    {Springwell quarry}is 60 years old,
 120 feet deep and mines carboniferous 
 rock which is about 250 million years 
 old.  The stone is used for{building, 
{grindstones and hardcore.} At the     
 bottom of the quarry was a small hut  
 which was hardly ever seen by anybody 
 so it was named "Seldom Seen".        
    From the C18th{coal mining}was the 
 area's main industry.  Today the      
{landscape}shows evidence of mining    
 but there are no working pits.In 1855 
 two shafts were sunk at Wardley,      
 called{Follingsby Pit.}Later in 1948, 
 Wardley and Usworth, which was nearby,
 were joined, but Usworth shaft was    
 closed in August 1974 because of      
 exhaustion of valuable reserves.      
    The land on which{Usworth Colliery 
 stood has been reclaimed and part of  
 it has been used as the site for      
 Sulgrave Village.                     </content>
