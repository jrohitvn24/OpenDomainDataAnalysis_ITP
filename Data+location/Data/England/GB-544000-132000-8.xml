		<title>08RIDING ON ASHDOWN FOREST</title>
		<content>   Riding is a very popular pursuit in 
 this area.  There are two riding      
 centres and the many summer horse     
 shows and gymkhanas are well          
 supported.                            
   Bridlepaths crisscross the Forest   
 and riders obtain a permit from the   
 Conservators to exercise their horses 
 and ponies.  Occasionally the         
 bridlepaths are closed due to weather 
 or over-riding.                       
   The local hunt uses the Forest amid 
 some controversy, although it has been
 a hunting ground since the 13th       
 century.                              
   Keeping a horse is expensive if the 
 rider has no private grazing and      
 stabling.  Half livery (the rider     
 exercising and supplying feed) is     
 about Â£10 - Â£15 per week: full livery 
 about Â£30.  Shoeing costs in the      
 region of Â£17, every 6 weeks.         </content>
