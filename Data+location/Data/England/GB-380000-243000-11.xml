 houses built after the Second World   
 War.Most people work in{Great Malvern 
 (three miles to the West) where the   
 largest employer is the{Royal Signals 
{and Radar Establishment.              
                        The village has
 been left with few{amenities.}The     
{school}closed during the 1950's and is
 now two houses.The{Rectory}nearby has 
 been converted to private use and the 
{vicar}is 'shared' with the{Parish of  
{Madresfield.                          
             There no longer any{shops
