		<title>04Pine Tree Farm</title>
		<content>  The farm consists of about 80 acres  
 of pastureland on which ,at present,53
 Friesian cows are grazed. Mr. Stott   
 takes a hay and silage crop from some 
 of the 15 fields but grows no other   
 crops. As he does not raise his own   
 heifers,which requires 3 years'       
 advance planning,Mr. Stott has not    
 been badly affected by the new E.E.C. 
 milk quotas. Water for the farm comes 
 from a small reservoir which provides 
 water ror several farms in the area.  
 There are over 50 chickens on the farm
 but the eggs are for the family's own 
 use or are sold privately.            
  In one of the fields there is a round
 barrow and legend has it that the     
 Celts fought the local,Saxon,         
 population and were heavily defeated, 
 fleeing to Devon and Cornwall.All the 
 dead are supposedly buried in the     
 round barrow.                         </content>
