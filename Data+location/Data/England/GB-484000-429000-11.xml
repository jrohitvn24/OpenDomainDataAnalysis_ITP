		<title>11Customs.Agricultural Show.</title>
		<content>  For well over sixty years, the local 
 farming community have worked together
 to put on the Newport and District    
 Agricultural Show.This event is held  
 traditionally on the second Saturday  
 in June.The actual locaton of the show
 field has changed over the years but  
 the format of the show has altered    
 little during the passage of sixty    
 years.There are still classes for     
 heavy horses,cattle and sheep.Classes 
 for pigs have been stopped following  
 the risk of disease.                  
  Classes for riding horses are still  
 popular but by far the largest entry  
 for the Show is in the Show Jumping   
 Section.Last year the Secretary,Mr.S. 
 Watt recieved entries from over 350   
 competitors.                          
  A further tradition attraction at the
 show is a travelling fair,adding noise
 and excitement to the occasion.       </content>
