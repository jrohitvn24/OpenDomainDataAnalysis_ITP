		<content>  In this dairy farming area,recent    
 Common Market agricultural policy     
 which introduced milk quotas,         
 has badly affected local farmers.     
 The amount of milk that can be sold   
 by each farm is limited to the        
 equivalent of their 1983 production   
 minus 10%.                            
  At 200 acre Rubbery (Rowberrow)      
 Farm, Mr Vearncombe has reduced his   
 herd of 100 cows to 90,milking 79     
 of them.He says"Thinking of ways of   
 maintaining ones income on a          
 reduced output,stimulates the mind".  
 His answer to the problem is to buy   
 in less feed and  produce more on the 
 farm.Increased corn production is     
 milled for feed by a mobile mixing    
 lorry which calls once a month.       
  Farmhouse holidays and a new camping 
 site for visitors now help the farm   
 budget.                               </content>
