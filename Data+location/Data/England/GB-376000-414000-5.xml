		<title>05BEEF FARMING IN GREENMOUNT</title>
		<content>{Beef-farming}is carried out at Tower  
 Farm in Greenmount. It was built in   
 1840 by Joshua Knowles for stabling   
 the horses which hauled cartloads of  
 cotton from his nearby mill.          
  For the past twenty two years it has 
 been owned by Mr.V.Chadwick and is a  
 beef farm unlike many dairy farms in  
 the area. There are also 59 ewes      
 served by 3 rams and this year 104    
 lambs were born. Mr Chadwick has 100  
 acres of land, some of it rented and  
 he produces enough hay for winter     
 feeding.                              
  Mr Chadwick uses markets at          
 Preston,Clitheroe,Haslingden and      
 Blackburn, depending where he can get 
 the best price for his animals.       
  There are 14{stables}rented out to   
 horse owners and there are 3 working  
 dogs on the farm.{Vandalism}is a      
 problem with animals being injured.   </content>
