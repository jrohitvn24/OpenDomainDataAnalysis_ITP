		<content>{Detatched houses:} There are a number 
 of detatched houses in the area and   
 these are of many varied styles.      
 Some, like 'Burnside' were built by   
 the mill owners in the nineteenth     
 century, whilst others date from the  
 early twentieth century or later.     
                                       
 Bleasdale Tower situated in the NW    
 corner of the block lies in the centre
 of its own private estate, surrounded 
 by extensive woodlands and tenented   
 farms.                                
                                       
{Bungalows:} On Strickens Lane there   
 are a number of small bungalows which 
 were built in the inter war period as 
 holiday homes. They command extensive 
 views towards the coast.  Over the    
 years they have been bought and lived 
 in permanently by local people.
