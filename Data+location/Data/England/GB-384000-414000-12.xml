		<title>12Local history. The Riviera</title>
		<content> There used to be an open-air swimming 
 pool in Norden called the Riviera.It  
 opened in 1935 and shut down in 1966. 
 It was really nice. There were two    
 pools, diving stages and a water      
 chute. At night dances were held there
 and the trees were covered in fairy   
 lights. Miranda's granny worked in the
 cafe there. She told us that she      
 worked at weekends as a waitress. The 
 hours were 10:00 am. to 11:00 pm.     
    A ghost was said to appear         
 sometimes but its presence was felt   
 mostly in the kitchen, seeming to     
 brush your shoulders or arms.         
 Sometimes it was seen by staff after  
 closing time.                         
    On hot summer days hundreds of     
 people went to the Riviera to swim and
 sunbathe. Now it has all gone, only   
 trees and rubbish remain.
