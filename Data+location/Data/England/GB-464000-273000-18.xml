		<title>18Children's favourite food</title>
		<content>My favourite food is fish and chips,   
fried and then served with plenty of   
salt and vinegar.                      
My favourite breakfast is weetabix,it  
has this name because it is like a     
biscuit of wheat,I eat it with milk and
sugar.                                 
I also like my Sunday dinner,this      
consists of Yorkshire pudding,potatoes,
stuffing,mint sauce,vegetables - often 
carrots - and pork. Yorkshire pudding  
is made from eggs,flour and milk all   
mixed together and then cooked in the  
oven. Mint sauce is made from a herb   
called mint which we chop up finely and
put into some vinegar.Sunday dinner is 
superb and we all sit down together as 
a family which makes it even more      
special as an important occasion.
