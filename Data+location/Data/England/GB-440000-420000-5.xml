		<content> Lin Pac is the largest manufacturing  
 works in the town.There are two works,
 one producing cardboard boxes of all  
 types including egg boxes and the     
 next producing polystyrene goods such 
 as supermarket food trays.The Lin Pac 
 company came to Featherstone 25 years 
 ago.The development of the supermarket
 shopping system has encouraged growth 
 at Lin Pac as it relies heavily on pre
 packed goods.In 1984 the factory was  
 extended and its polystyrene trays are
 distributed all over the country.The  
 company employs approximately 400 men 
 working an uninterrupted seven day    
 week on three shifts,rotating the days
 off.Recently they bought a field to be
 developed as a sports area.Today they 
 only have a social club for workers.  
 There are two small clothing works in 
 the town mainly employing women.
