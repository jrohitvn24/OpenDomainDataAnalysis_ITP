		<title>09CORNISH CROSSES</title>
		<content> In our D- block there are many Cornish
 crosses although they are not marked  
 on the Ordnance Survey map .They are  
 between 6 and 8 feet high .           
 They are made out of granite .The top 
 is carved in the shape of a cross on  
  a round piece of granite They used   
 them before permanent church buildings
 were erected for praying at instead   
 of a church .They would put small huts
 over the crosses to keep warm and to  
 keep themselves dry .They were        
 usually put at a cross roads. There   
 sometimes was writing on them .Some of
 them in our area have been moved from 
 their original site;there are three at
 Lanteglos Church and a memorial stone 
 to a man who died in the tenth        
 century.They should not be confused   
 with granite scratching posts for     
 cattle which you can see in some      
 fields.                               </content>
