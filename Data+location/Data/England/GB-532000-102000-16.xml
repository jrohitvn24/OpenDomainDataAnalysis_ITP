		<title>16SOCIAL CONCERNS : THE SURVEY</title>
		<content> In Whitehawk there were fewer worries 
 about{vandalism}and{bus services      
 expressed by people we asked than in  
 Queen's Park. Many were worried about 
 lack of facilities for the old and the
{unemployed.}The general state of the  
 houses and gardens was better in      
 Whitehawk than its reputation         
 suggested. The more mixed area of     
 Kemptown revealed that alongside the  
 pleasant gardens and Regency houses of
 Sussex Square people were living in   
 some{financial difficulty}and were    
 worried about the state of their      
 houses and the{safety}of the area at  
 night. What we think is most striking 
 is the contrast in attitudes and      
 styles of living in a small area and  
 what can be revealed by actualy       
 looking and asking.
