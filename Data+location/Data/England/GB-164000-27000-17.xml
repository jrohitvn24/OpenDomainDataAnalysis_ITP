		<title>17SCHOOLS IN HELSTON (1)</title>
		<content>                                       
 Helston has one large secondary       
 comprehensive school and three junior 
 schools, each with an infant          
 department. Twenty five years ago     
 there was only one infant school, St  
 Michael's Infants, in Church Hill(next
 to St Michael's Church), one junior   
 school, St Michael's, and Helston     
 Grammar School.                       
       The comprehensive school has    
 over 1600 pupils from the ages of 11  
 to 18 and incorporates two older      
 schools on its site-Helston Grammar   
 School, which now forms the lower     
 school of the comprehensive, and      
 Gwealhellis  secondary modern school, 
 which now forms the middle school.
