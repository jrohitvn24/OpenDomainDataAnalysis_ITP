		<title>05My impressions of the area.</title>
		<content>  In Moxley most of the land is used   
 for residential or commercial         
 purposes. Most of the old,{disused }  
 houses and factories are being        
 replaced by more modern houses, some  
 areas have houses which are tightly   
 packed. Moxley is not a famous area   
 but the people know of the local      
 landmarks. One such landmark is the   
{sanna.}This is a canal which backs    
 onto the the Moxley Isolation         
 Hospital. Hence the canal's name, a   
 shortened version of sanatorium.      
 Moxley in my opinion is a{depressing}}
 area. I think this leads teanagers to 
 smoking, glue-sniffing and vandalism. 
 Teenagers have also taken to creating 
 colourful{graffiti}to decorate walls  
 and buildings. There is little else to
 do in the area after school finishes.
