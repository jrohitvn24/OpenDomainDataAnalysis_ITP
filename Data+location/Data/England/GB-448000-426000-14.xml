		<content>   At home I get up at quarter to nine 
 and put on the television. It takes me
 about fifteen minutes to get dressed. 
 I never have breakfast. I sit down to 
 watch the television for a while. If  
 there is nothing good on the          
 television then I put on the          
 video-recorder and watch that. I      
 enjoyed watching the recording of     
 Live-aid. This was a live concert     
 given by popstars to help raise money 
 for the starving people in Africa.    
   My friend Joseph has a pet rabbit.  
 In the morning he has to go outside to
 uncover the rabbit hutch and give the 
 rabbit some food. The rabbit is called
 Clover.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
