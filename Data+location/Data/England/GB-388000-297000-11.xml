		<title>11A Canal in Wolverhampton</title>
		<content>There are several canals in            
Wolverhampton and one,the Stafford and 
Worcester,passes near to my home.The   
canal was started in 1766 and took six 
years to build.The depth of the canal  
is six feet.This only applies to the   
centre as the bed is in the shape of a 
V.The canal is 46 miles long and there 
are 41 locks.The canal has to be       
cleaned out once a year.The canal links
the River Severn at Stourport to the   
River Mersey.                          
Most of the boats are used for pleasure
now,but occasionally a barge can be    
seen carrying coal.No longer are horses
to be seen pulling boats but the tow   
paths can still be walked along.       
The busiest time of the year for the   
canal people is from May to September.
