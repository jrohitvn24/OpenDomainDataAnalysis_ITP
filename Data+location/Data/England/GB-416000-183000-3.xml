 graffiti in the subways.Kids make the 
 walls colourful with bright coloured  
 pens and spray cans.This graffiti     
 makes the place look like its's got a 
 bit of life.Sometimes it is spoiled by
 kids scribbling on it.Most of the     
 walls have bad words or drawings on   
 them. There is some graffiti on the   
 bike sheds.

 on purpose and for the fun of it.These
 people cause upset and shame to the   
 town and people living in it.People   
 who do graffiti or vandalism should be
 put in prison.
