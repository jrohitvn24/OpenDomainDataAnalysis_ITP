		<title>06BEAFORD;A BOY'S SATURDAY</title>
		<content>   On Saturday morning I woke up at 7  
 a.m. and went to help Dad with the    
 milking.  When we had finished we went
 indoors to a breakfast of bacon, eggs 
 and potato. Afterwards we injected    
 some sheep with Panacur to prevent    
 worms. It was 12 noon when I returned 
 home. I listened to Dave Lee Travis on
 the radio.  After dinner I went down  
 to the stream and built a small dam.  
 It was quite easy to build because    
 there were some rocks on the bank.    
 Later I fed the bullocks some straw.  
 At 9 p.m. that evening one of our cows
 calved.  As I went indoors, the       
 television programme I was looking    
 forward to seeing had begun. It was a 
 boxing match between Eusebio Pedrosa  
 and Barry McGuigan, which Barry won.  
 I had an enjoyable Saturday.
