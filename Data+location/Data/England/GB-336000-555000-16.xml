		<title>16A SCHOOL DAY IN CARLISLE</title>
		<content>  I get all my school stuff together   
 and leave the house at 8.35.It takes  
 about five minutes to walk to school  
 where I have a game of soccer.J8 take 
 on J6.We usually lose.At 9 o'clock we 
 go into school.We take register.Then I
 get on with my spelling workshop.Today
 after assembly we measured around the 
 school.Then we had to condense a piece
 of work we had written on 'A Typical  
 Family Sunday'.I had to turn 257 words
 into 150 words.At dinnertime I walked 
 home with Jonathan and Michael.For    
 dinner I had cold beef.I watched      
 cricket before going back to school.  
 We played 'Buzz off' until quarter    
 past one,when we went back into       
 school.To start off with we read      
 quietly for about ten minutes.Then we 
 practised the singing for our 'Harold 
 and William' play.
