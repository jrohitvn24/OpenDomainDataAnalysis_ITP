		<title>17A TEACHER</title>
		<content>  "Pupils used to respect their        
 teachers because of that label,but now
 teachers are judged by their own      
 personalities or ability to teach."   
  Education cuts are affecting the     
 school-classes are a lot larger eg:-35
 pupils per class and there is a lack  
 of books.Teachers are rather          
 demoralised.The pay for teaching is   
 between Â£100 and Â£200 and some        
 teachers at the bottom of the scale   
 claim supplimentary benefit.It seems  
 that larger classes in secondary      
 schools are occuring at the same time 
 as primary schools are closing,due to 
 a fall in total pupil                 
 numbers."Teachers do not understand   
 how this has been allowed to happen."
