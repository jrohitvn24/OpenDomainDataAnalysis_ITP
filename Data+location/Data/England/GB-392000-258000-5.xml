		<content>      During 1985 the quiet villages in
 our area were invaded by one of the   
 large oil companies when they         
 undertook the major project of laying 
 a pipeline from Wolverhampton to      
 Fawley.                               
      First they fenced off a strip 60 
 metres wide , then they drove through 
 removing all the top soil. This was   
 followed by the digging of a trench.  
      The pipes were laid out - three  
 welds to each sectional joint , then  
 lowered into the trench. The trench   
 was then refilled and the top soil    
 spread back over the surface.         
      Finally each hedge that had to be
 grubbed out was then replaced and all 
 the ditches redug.                    
      It is now difficult to see where 
 the work was done.
