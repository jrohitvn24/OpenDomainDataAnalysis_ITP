 -al settlement it was. Very few of the
 l20 people who live there actually do 
 work there. There is a central group  
 of 35 houses and in common with other 
 local villages there is a{mixture of  
{architectural styles and materials.   
 The houses date from pre-Elizabethan  
 to the present day.{Stone House}is    
 documented from l535.{The Mill House  
 operates as a Short Stay Home and the 
 Pond has been extended for use as a   
 Trout Farm. The Blacksmith works from 
 the refurbished stable block and he   
 still uses the{200yr old Forge}across 
 the road. A set of shoes costs Â£16.

{Farmgate Meats}are a farm based Butch 
 -er's Shop.{Radcliffe's}run a market
