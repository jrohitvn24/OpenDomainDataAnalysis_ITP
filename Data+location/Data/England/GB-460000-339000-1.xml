		<content> Every Saturday morning I go up to     
 Calveton which is a small village in  
 Nottinghamshire. Where I go to a      
 stable called "St Clements Lodge"     
 which is down a small track called    
 "Woods Lane", near the square. They   
 have 27 horses or ponies there. I have
 ridden all but five. Three are not    
 ridden because they have Pedagrees and
 are owned by Nick. Nick is our        
 schooling teacher and we ride for     
 about ten minuites up to a large field
 and do jumping, fenceing, racing,     
 polo and ordinary riding. There is a  
 beginers lesson where I first learnt  
 to ride. My first horse was called    
 James but now I ride Spring Song. I   
 have never been hunting  because I    
 don't believe in it.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
