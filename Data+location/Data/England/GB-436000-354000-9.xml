		<content> We sent a questionnaire to adults in  
 our area about their leisure-time     
 activities. We found that the most    
 popular activity is gardening(18 men  
 and 13 women) followed by walking(14  
 men and 13 women).A 'meal out' is next
 in popularity (7 men and 5 women)     
 closely followed by swimming (3 men   
 and 5women).                          
 Other activities were only mentioned  
 by men. These are fishing, jogging,   
 visiting pubs or clubs and playing    
 cricket and judo.Women named fewer    
 activities perhaps because(as their   
 children say) they have less free     
 time.                                 
 Most people do not leave our survey   
 area to enjoy these pursuits and the  
 furthest distance travelled is 5      
 miles.                                
                                       
                                       </content>
