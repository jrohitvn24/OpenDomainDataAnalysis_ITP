		<title>11GUITING POWER.PLAYGROUP</title>
		<content>    The Playgroup meets three mornings 
 per week in the Village Hall. The     
 number of children who attend is 10.  
 They are three and four years old, but
 there is also a Mother and Baby group 
 once a week.                          
    The children pay 50p per day, but  
 the Playgroup also makes money by     
 Sponsored Bike Rides,Jumble Sales and 
 a Christmas Fair.                     
    Mums take turns to help the        
 Playgroup leader.                     
    Each year, the Playgroup leader    
 spends about 50-80 on equipment.    
 They have ten large pieces of         
 apparatus, and about 100 small toys.  
 The toys are fun, but the children    
 also learn from them as they play.
