		<title>19Housing around Bentley</title>
		<content>{Housing}in the area is very dispersed.
 Even the villages of Upper and Lower  
 Bentley and Woodgate Have only a few  
 Houses and none have a village centre.
 As the area is agricultural most of   
 the houses are farm houses or{farm    
{workers cottages.}Many of them are    
 old, some are{timber framed}though    
 most are{brick built.}Some cottages   
 have been modernised and are now homes
 to business men who travel to the     
 nearby towns to work. Some new        
 bungalows have been built but they are
 individual ones not part of a         
 development. There are some farm      
 workers homes that were built after   
 the Second World War. One person lives
 in a small caravan which is           
 permanently sited in Woodgate.
