<title>07Graves Park/Millhouses Park</title>
<content>

Graves Park, the largest park in Sheffield, has over the passed few years introduced an animal farm including a rare breeds section.  There is a large children's play area in front of the Rose Garden Cafe (which has also undergone a "face lift" recently).&lt;br />&lt;br />In addition there is a further small playground close by the Woodseats entrance of the park.&lt;br />&lt;br />Woodlands and grasslands remain pretty much the same as when Aldermen J G Graves, by trust deed, gifted the park to the citizens of Sheffield.  Sadly, there are no longer any rowing boats allowed on what was referred to as "the boating lake" due to legitimate health and safety reasons.&lt;br />&lt;br />Millhouses Park no longer sports an outdoor swimming pool - this has been replaced by a "Splash water project" which has both fun and educational values.  The paddling pools have been replaced a "the Fishway" a natural hapitat created for fish. &lt;br />&lt;br />Both parks well worth a visit   &lt;br />
