		<title>11EMPLOYMENT: WARLEY, ESSEX</title>
		<content>   The main employer in the block is   
{Ford's,}whose{offices}are at 594915.  
 This is the{HQ}of both{Ford of Britain
 Motor Co.Ltd.and of{Ford of Europe.   
 The offices were built in 1964, the HQ
 having previously been in Regent      
 Street, W1. The site was chosen for   
{proximity to Dagenham,}&amp; the needs for
{more space}and{lower costs than}were  
 available in{London.}The offices      
 co-ordinate the marketing and         
 manufacturing of all Ford cars in the 
 U.K. and on the continent. The        
 workforce is currently 1,552 salaried 
 staff. 80% of employees live within a 
 15 mile radius. The amentity value of 
 the site is high, but was only a minor
 factor in location. The HQ opened in  
 1968, long before the motorway network
 was developed: position near the M25  
 is thus an added and unexpected bonus.
