		<content>   There is a Church of England Church 
 in Netherwitton which shares the Vicar
 of Whalton with 4 other parishes. The 
 electoral role consists of 30 people. 
 The congregation is so small that all 
 members are on the Parochial Parish   
 Council which runs the Church and the 
 Parish in conjunction with the Vicar. 
   The Church is on an old 18th Century
 foundation, but apart from a small    
 part it was rebuilt in Victorian      
 times. It was originally the Chapel   
 belonging to the Hall and the Chancel 
 is still the property of the owner and
 looked after by him. The churchyard is
 now full and an extension 1/4 mile    
 away across the stream has been in use
 since the 1920's. There are a few     
 Methodists, Roman Catholics and       
 Jehovah's Witnesses but nowhere for   
 their community workshop.
