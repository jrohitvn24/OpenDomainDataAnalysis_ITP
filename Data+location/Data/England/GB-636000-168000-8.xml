		<title>08    The Supermarket</title>
		<content>    There is one large shop in the old 
 village centre:Lipton's supermarket.  
 It is run by 20 staff, shared among   
 the main store and the butchery,      
 fruit, vegetables and provisions      
 departments. Stock is delivered from  
 the wholesale depot each weekday, and 
 takes only a few minutes to come from 
 Dumpton Park. Perishable goods such as
 milk, butter, yogurt and cream have   
 only a two day life, though some dairy
 items last 7 to 10 days before they   
 must be removed from the shelves. The 
 assistant manager told us the biggest 
 worry for a large shop is the keeping 
 of frozen food. If there is a power   
 failure, things can be covered in     
 metal foil for a short time, but there
 is no back-up generator in the event  
 of a long term failure. About 5000    
 people use the store each week, mostly
 from within walking distance.         </content>
