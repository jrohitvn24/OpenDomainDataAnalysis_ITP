		<content> Formal schooling begins in September  
 following a child's fourth birthday at
 the Church Aided Infant and Junior    
 School. The School housed in two      
 buildings caters for 170 children     
 seeking to give them a good foundation
 in language and number and see them   
 develop fully physically, socially and
 spiritually. A voluntary selection    
 test at 11+ enables some children to  
 go to the Stratford Grammar Schools   
 or,in the main to Kineton High School.
   The High School opened in 1957 as a 
 'neighbourhood' school serving a wide 
 area. A large scale bussing operation 
 transports the 1300 students, daily. A
 system of assesment in every subject  
 each half term monitors students'     
 progress. There is a uniform in black,
 scarlet and silver, including crest of
 a silver crown.
