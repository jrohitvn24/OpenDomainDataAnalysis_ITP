		<content> Blackmoss County House Hotel, Thornley
 is on land that was part of the Earl  
 of Derby's estates, and occasionally  
 the Earl lived there.   The premises  
 were burned down and rebuilt in the   
 early 1900s but it remained a private 
 house until 1981 when the present     
 owners converted its three wings into 
 an hotel.   The clientele is varied,  
 during the week it mostly caters for  
 businessmen but at weekends it is used
 for private functions such as weddings
 and other celebrations.               
                                       
 The hotel is residential and therefore
 has the usual lounges, restaurants,   
 bars, etc. but also offers a solarium,
 sauna and swimming pool to its guests.
 A dance room is available for the     
 private functions. There is a staff of
 about ten, who are both full and      
 part-time and mostly live locally.    </content>
