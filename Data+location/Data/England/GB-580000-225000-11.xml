		<title>11FOOTPATHS AND BRIDLEWAYS</title>
		<content> There are plenty of footpaths,        
 bridleways and farm tracks which      
 criss-cross the countryside, although 
 some of the footpaths are overgrown.  
 Some of the wo od land, especially    
 Great Monks Wood are full of wild     
 flowers.  The main  species to be     
 found are:                            
   primroses  cowslips   violets       
   bluebells  campions   orchids       
   wood anenomes  as well as the more  
 common varieties.  The hedgerows are  
 an abundance of hedge parsley in the  
 late spring.  While the nightingale   
 visits Nunty's Wood the               
 kingfisher is a resident along the    
 streams and brooks.  The streams are  
 full of weed in summer because of the 
 high nitrate level.  The  dragonflies 
 and damselflies are also dazzling to  
 the eye along these streams in the    
 summer months.                        </content>
