		<title>19Police: Pateley</title>
		<content>  In Pateley Bridge there is a         
 police station and a Magistrates'     
 Court. The station has an outer office
 with a counter for the public, a      
 sergeant's office, an interview room  
 and two cells. There are six          
 constables stationed here, with one   
 sergeant in charge. There are no      
 police women however. The local police
 constables work two shifts. These are 
 from 9am to 5pm and 5pm to 1am. They  
 are also on call from Harrogate police
 station, for any emergencies, during  
 the night. The most regular problem   
 for the police in this area is that of
 poaching. There is very little trouble
 in the town itself. The constables    
 patrol the town of Pateley on foot.   
 However, for the rest of their beat,  
 they use a car. They also visit some  
 of the local schools as part of their 
 community work.                       </content>
