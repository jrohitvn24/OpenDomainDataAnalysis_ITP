		<content>   About 50% of the houses are flats   
 and council houses and the rest are   
 privately owned.                      
   Many of the privately owned houses  
 are between 60 and 80 years old. The  
 flats and council houses are up to 40 
 years old although some have been     
 recently constructed during the last  
 decade.                               
   Many of the adults who we asked what
 they do for entertainment said that   
 they just stay in and watch           
 television. Others said that they go  
 to the local pub for a pint.          
   When the teenagers were asked what  
 they did for entertainment about 30%  
 of them said that they either wandered
 about the playground or stayed in and 
 watched T.V.. Children aged between   
 five and twelve just play in their    
 garden or stay in to watch T.V.
