		<title>15TRANSPORT - NORTH TAWTON</title>
		<content>{ROADS }North Tawton is only 5 miles   
        from the{A30}dual carriageway  
  at Whiddon Down which in turn joins  
 the national motorway network in      
  Exeter. A recent major road          
 improvement involving the road from   
 Winkleigh to North Tawton and the     
 raising of the railway bridge south of
 De Bathe Cross on this road now means 
 that large vehicles travelling from   
 North Devon can gain access to the M5 
 without having to pass through        
 Crediton and Exeter.                  
{RAILWAYS }The railway line which      
 passes through North Tawton is mainly 
 used for carrying stone from Meldon   
 Quarry near Okehampton.It is also used
 occasionally for carrying troops to   
 okehampton Camp.Recently a trial      
 passenger service has been introduced 
 between Okehampton and Exeter.
