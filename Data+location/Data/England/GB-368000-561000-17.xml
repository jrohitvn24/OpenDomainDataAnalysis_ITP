		<content>    I live in{Park Village.} It is     
 very small.  Only{23}people live      
 there. There are{23}houses; some of   
 them are empty.  There are{4}children.
 We all come to school at Haltwhistle. 
    On Sunday we all go to Sunday      
 School.  There are 3 teachers and 14  
 children because they come from farms 
 around the village. This year we went 
 to the Light Water Valley on the      
 Sunday School outing.                 
    Two people have dogs and 8 people  
 have cars.  People work in Carlisle,  
 Hexham, Haltwhistle and Spadeadam, at 
 Gilsland.  We don't have any shops,   
 just a telephone box, post box, and a 
 Methodist Chapel.                     
    Park Village has changed a lot     
 since I came to live there 7 years    
 ago.  7 people have moved and 3 people
 have died.                            
                                       </content>
