		<title>20TRANSPORT: DRAYTON BASSETT</title>
		<content>Most villagers rely on thier own means 
of transport.  There is a single       
Midland Red bus service to Tamworth    
once a day and a regular service into  
Birmingham.  The main roads (A5, A453, 
A4091) pass close by the village.      
Traffic has increased.  Drivers        
sometimes use the village as a         
short-cut, upsetting residents as it   
creares noise and can be dangerous     
owing to the narrow country lanes and  
incresed use of farm machinery in the  
area.  There area 2 car parks in the   
village, by the workingmen's club and  
the park.  There is no railway in the  
immediate vicinity.  The nearest       
station is Wilnecote (3 miles N.E.)    
The Birmingham - Fazeley canal built   
1783 (1/2 mile E.) is well known for   
fishing, walks along the tow-path and  
pleasure cruising holidays.
