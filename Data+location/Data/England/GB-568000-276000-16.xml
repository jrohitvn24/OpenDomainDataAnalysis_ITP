		<title>16 Holywell Farm</title>
		<content>  The farm used to have 220 acres but  
the present owner has sold parcels of  
the land for the Pig Farm at Wildmere  
Farm, a smaller general purpose farm   
and 100 acres of arable land,which used
to be waterlogged, to a Haulage and    
Agricultural Contractor. The owner now 
has only 30 acres.                     
 There is a Suffolk Barn, built in 1776
and constructed of timber from wooden  
ships that were replaced by metal hull 
ships. The curved timber from the bows 
of the ships can be seen supporting the
roof. The building has recently been   
listed as a building of special        
interest.                              
 The dried beds of some ponds on this  
farm can be seen and these ponds were  
once used by Monks from a Monastery at 
Eriswell,to breed and keep trout and   
other fish for their food supply.
