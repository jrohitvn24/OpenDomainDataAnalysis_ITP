		<title>12RECREATION</title>
		<content>  The main recreation in the area is   
 walking and the area is criss_crossed 
 by public footpaths and bridleways all
 of which are well used.  Kinsbourne   
 Green Common is used for walking, kite
 flying, picnics and horse_riding.     
  Redbourn Golf Club is fairly new, it 
 is a private course and was converted 
 into a Golf Club from a farm in the   
 1970's.  It has an 18 hole and a 9    
 hole course as well as a practice     
 course.                               
  Harpendenbury Riding Stables use the 
 farm house and buildings and a small  
 area for practice jumps, riding school
 and training.                         
  The Hertfordshire Show Ground is     
 localed to the west of the A5 just    
 north of Redbourn.  The show is held  
 annually over the Spring Bank holiday.
 It is an agricultural show with other 
 country attractions.                  </content>
