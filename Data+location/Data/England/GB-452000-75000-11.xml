 On the outskirts of Whitwell Village  
 stands a beautiful old stone house    
 called{Dean's Farm.}The present house 
 dates from 1702, but there has been a 
 dwelling here for more than 600 years.
 In the grounds is an original water   
 system dating back 600-700 years. The 
 water is used today to irrigate the   
 garden. There is also a collection of 
 ancient farm implements and machinery.
 On this unusual farm the farmer has   
 all the necessary equipment to run a  
 large mixed farm of about 200 acres.  
 He keeps 150 sheep(Dorset Horns) and a
 herd of 96 Friesian cows. Fodder      
 crops; barley,swedes and grass(which  
 is made into hay and silage) are grown
 for the animals.
