		<title>10Ryedale Sports Club</title>
		<content> This was set up in 1960 by a group of 
 cricket players. Since then it has    
 expanded,and now caters for           
 cricket,football, tennis, hockey,     
 table-tennis and netball.             
 The club, which has 250 subscribers a 
 year, is quite successful with about  
 25 teams altogether.                  
{Funds.}The club is funded entirely by 
 subscriptions and fund-raising        
 events.The secretary of the club said 
 that money raised by each section is  
 pooled in one large treasury.This     
 ensures a high standard of upkeep for 
 the whole club, which is not the      
 system used in some where those who   
 raised the money believe it should be 
 spent in support of their chosen      
 activity.
