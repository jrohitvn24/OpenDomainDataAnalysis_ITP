		<content>{MP's,}as well as having much          
 responsibility in Parliament and in   
 the party, also have a very great     
 social commitment.They must attend    
 important social functions, their     
{'surgeries',}and in the time of       
 campaign,they must visit people to    
 gain popularity. They are also        
 committed to answering every letter   
 that is sent to them. This takes,on   
 average, two hours per day,and he has 
 to employ 2 secretaries to cope with  
 them. M.P.s,depending on their        
 distance away from Westminster, are   
 given{travel allowances}for car,      
 train, and for very distant M.P.s, air
 travel. Parliamentary sessions are    
 only held on weekdays so most M.P.s   
 return to their{constituencies}at the 
 week_ends. On some Fridays it is not  
 absolutely necessary for the Whips to 
 be there until the close.             </content>
