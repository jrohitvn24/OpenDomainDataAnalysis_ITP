		<title>13Recreation In Gunton</title>
		<content> Recreation is found in the nearby     
villages,towns or Norwich 18 miles     
away. The annual agricultural show     
in Blickling park on August bank       
Holiday Monday attracts a huge number  
of local people,as does the Royal      
Norfolk show in June. Some of the local
farmers exhibit their livestock at     
these shows. There are mens clubs in   
nearby village halls,where competitive 
darts, billiards and bowls are played. 
Whist Drives,Discos,Bingo and parties  
are organised during the winter. There 
are Womens Institutes and Old People's 
Clubs in easy reach of the area. Most  
of those living within the park do so  
due to the recreational amenities      
available. There are many roads and    
paths free of traffic for cycling,     
jogging,horse riding and walking and   
for nature lovers etc. There is good   
fishing and an annual hunt meet.       </content>
