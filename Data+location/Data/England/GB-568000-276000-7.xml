		<title>07 Beck House</title>
		<content>                                       
 Beck House is one of the largest      
houses in Beck Row. There used to be a 
moat around the house and The Beck used
to flow through the garden. As a result
of the previously marshy nature of the 
ground, the house is slowly sinking and
every now and then, part of the door   
has  to be cut off to make it fit.     
 The house was built in 1885 and was   
painted pink at one time but this has  
now  been washed off.
