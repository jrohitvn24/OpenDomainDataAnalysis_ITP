		<title>05    FUNTINGTON FORGE</title>
		<content> The forge is owned by Mr.Wilkinson.   
 He has been a blacksmith for 30 years.
 On average he shoes about five horses 
 a day at a price of Â£15 per set.To    
 shoe a horse it will take between one 
 and a half and two hours.The shoes    
 come in 12 sizes.The largest one he   
 has made was 22 inches across.He also 
 does surgical work.He is kept busy as 
 there are 6 riding schools in the     
 district.The shoes are made of steel  
 except for racing horses' shoes which 
 are made of aluminium.Some of the     
 tools are the anvil,that weighs       
 125kg.,pick mallet and hammer.Instead 
 of the old bellows they now use       
 electric ones.
