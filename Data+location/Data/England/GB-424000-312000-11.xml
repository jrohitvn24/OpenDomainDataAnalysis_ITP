		<title>11Housing in Lullington</title>
		<content>   The standard  of housing in         
 Lullington village is very high. Most 
 of the 48 dwellings are over 50 years 
 old &amp; are owner occupied. There is an 
 even balance between detached &amp; semi- 
 detached premises. Several of the     
 original cottages have been renovated.
 Lullington Hall stables and the       
 blacksmiths shop have been converted  
 to provide two additional homes.      
   There are 6 council houses on the   
 eastern side of the village although  
 other rented accomodation is limited. 
 5 old peoples bungalows were built on 
 land previousy occupied by a terrace. 
 More recent development has been      
 restricted to infilling and only 1 new
 detached house has been added in the  
 last 15 years. Indeed, Lullington was 
 designated a Conservation Area in     
 1977. It has won Derbyshire's best    
 kept village award several times.     </content>
