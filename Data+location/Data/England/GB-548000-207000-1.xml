       The 12 square kilometre block of
 which the S.W. corner is{O/S:480070}  
 typical of much of West Essex. The    
 landscape is a pleasant blend of      
 gentle undulation punctuated by small 
 stands of mixed woodland. Annexation  
 of small farms and economic pressures 
 have brought about substantial changes
 in the countryside. Many hedges have  
 been 'grubbed up' and drainage ditches
 piped &amp; covered. The resultant huge   
 fields facilitate the intensive       
 mechanised farming dominant in the    
 area. Rural charm &amp; traditions are    
 preserved in the many cottages and    
 farmhouses dating back to Tudor times 
 &amp; earlier. The construction of the    
 M.11, whilst cutting a swathe through 
 good farmland has provided rapid links
 for agriculturists &amp; commuters which  
 many residents regard as beneficial.  </content>
