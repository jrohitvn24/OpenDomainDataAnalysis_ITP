		<title>10SHILLINGFORD-SOCIAL CONCERNS</title>
		<content> THERE HAS LATELY BEEN SOME CONCERN OF 
 THE FARMERS ON PEAMORE COTTAGE FARM   
 (THE M5 MOTORWAY RIGHT THROUGH THE    
 FARM).IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NO FUN TO    
 HAVE A MOTORWAY RUN THROUGH THE       
 FARMERS LAKE,GARDEN AND BE FORTY FEET 
 FROM ONE OF HIS SIDE WINDOWS.HE FOUGHT
 A GOOD FIGHT WITH THE ROAD COMPANY AND
 GOVERMENT AND AS A RESULT OF HIS      
 EFFORT THE MOTORWAY IS NOW MORE THAN A
 MILE AWAY.                            
 ALSO MANY FARMERS HAVE BEEN CONCERNED 
 WITH LOW FLYING AIRCRAFT(RAF).IT IS   
 THEIR CONCERN BECAUSE OF THE LIVESTOCK
 THEY KEEP THAT PROVIDES THEM WITH     
 THEIR LIVELYHOOD AND IF A COW,EWE OR  
 HEN IS ABOUT TO GIVE BIRTH AND PROVIDE
 THE FARMERS WITH MORE WEALTH YOU CAN  
 SEE THAT HE WOULD'NT BE VERY HAPPY IF 
 A THUNDERING JET WENT OVER THE FARM!  
                                       
                                       </content>
