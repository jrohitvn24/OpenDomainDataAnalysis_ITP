 One recent development is the building
 of a large{shopping}centre, SHOPPING  
 CITY, in Wood Green, though some small
 shopkeepers say that they had not lost
 much trade to the development.        
 There are several commmunal {         
{entertainments}, such as church youth 
 clubs, but most people said they      
 usually stayed at home watching T.V.  
 or videos.                            
 The Police said that the most common  
{crimes}in the area are Burglary and   
 Car Theft, with juvenile criminals    
 being mainly involved in Shoplifting, 
 most of it occuring in the Shopping   
 City during the school holidays.      
 A disproportionately large percentage 
 of the shops in the High Road are     
 owned and/or run by Asians who are    
 mainly recent arrivals in the area.
