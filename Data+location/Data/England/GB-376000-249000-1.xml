 Worcester .To get to Hereford you have
 to go to Ledbury.And in the village   
 there is an old halt at Newland East  
 signal box but it is not there now    
 because it has been demolished about  
 5 years ago. THere is a haulage yard, 
 whose lorries transportfruit,and other
 trade vehicles and cars and there is  
 an old gypsy caravan at the           
 wheelwright's shop.Newland signal box 
 is more than 100 years old at the     
 moment.                               
       .It opens at 6 o'clock and it   
 closes at 10.20 pm when the last train
