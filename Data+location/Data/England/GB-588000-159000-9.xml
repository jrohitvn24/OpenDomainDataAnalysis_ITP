		<content>House styles in the area range from    
medieval barns, some converted into    
houses soon after construction and some
very recently, to twentieth century    
housing.There is a fifteenth century   
yeoman's house in Bexon and a row of   
seventeenth century tradesmen's        
properties that have been converted    
into houses.The villages of Bredgar and
Tunstall contain examples of l7th and  
l8th century architecture often working
men's cottages. There are also some    
small modern estates of three and four 
bedroomed houses. Many of the older    
properties have been modernised with   
the addition of bathrooms, fitted      
kitchens and central heating. Some     
houses have replacement double-glazed  
windows and newly built garages.       
Gardens of the more modern properties  
tend to be smaller.
