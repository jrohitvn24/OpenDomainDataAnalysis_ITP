		<title>10About a Seven Year old.</title>
		<content>    My name is{Matthew Wood.}I am seven
 and a half years old. I live in a     
 house called{'Pinfarthings'}opposite  
 the village green. I live with my mum 
 and dad and my sister{Julie}who is    
 nearly ten. I go to school on my own, 
 but when it is raining I go in the    
 car. I wear neat clothes and I like   
 going to school. I have one hamster   
 and his name is{Fudgie.}My sister's   
 hamster is called{Goldilocks.}My      
 favourite meal is roast chicken; I    
 like the crispy skin! My favourite    
 pudding is mince pie. After school I  
 like playing on my bike with my       
 friends and I sometimes watch         
 television. We visit my Nan and       
 Grandpa in{Minchinhampton}and my other
 Nan in{Gloucester.}We quite often     
 visit my cousins in{Reading.}We travel
 by car.
