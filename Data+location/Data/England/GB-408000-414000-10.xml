		<content> Our school is a Church of England     
 school and we go to services at Christ
 Church Linthwaite about twice a term. 
 We also go there on special occasions 
 such as Christmas.I was confirmed last
 week.That means being made adult      
 member of the church when you can take
 communion.The Bishop confirms you by  
 laying his hands on your head and     
 saying,"I confirm you in the name of  
 God." There are also parish churches  
 at Golcar,Slaithwaite,Longwood and    
 Crosland Moor.                        
    There are a lot of non-conformist  
 churches in our area-mainly Methodist 
 and baptists.In Milnsbridge there is a
 Christadelphian meeting hall.
