		<content>  The church in Shelford is an Anglican
 church dedicated to St.Peter and St.  
 Paul.The church was built on the site 
 of an earlier Saxon church between    
 1250 and 1450.                        
  Services are held every Sunday       
 evening and on the morning of every   
 second Sunday in the month.The vicar  
 is also vicar at the much bigger      
 village of Radcliffe-On-Trent and is  
 called the Rev.Kenneth Newcombe. There
 are 5 bells in the church which are   
 rung every Sunday before the service  
 by the experienced campanologists, the
 Mills family.The average attendance   
 for services is 14 or 15 people,but   
 once a year,29th June,there is a big  
 festival to celebrate the feast day of
 St.Peter,when Shelford has a weekend  
 'feast'.On Saturday there are games   
 and side shows and on Sunday the      
 church is full for the service.       </content>
