		<content> Intaglio work is a design of thin cuts
 and dull and shiny patterns.  First   
 they cut the shiny design and dip it  
 in acid.  Then they cut the dull      
 design but don't dip it in the acid,  
 this part remains dull and white.     
 Cased glass is becoming rare because  
 it takes a long time to learn how to  
 make it.  You get a clear glass and   
 blow a coloured glass over it.        
 Coloured glass is made by mixing in   
 chemicals and a little gold.  The     
 layers are fused together by heat then
 a pattern is cut through the coloured 
 layer to the clear.                   
 An example from Brierglass is a l.5 m 
 tall vase which is the largest example
 of cut glass in the world. Another one
 is a vase costing Â£4000.  It is so    
 expensive because it has an intaglio  
 design cut into into cased glass and  
 it took 3 men 3 months to complete.   </content>
