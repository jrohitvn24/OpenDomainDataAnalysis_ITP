		<title>18ROADS TO AND FROM HORNSEA</title>
		<content> The children from 5.G. of Hornsea     
 Primary School conducted a survey of  
 the four roads that lead into and out 
 of the town. During our survey period 
 we found the B1242 leading towards    
 Bridlington was the busiest with an   
 average of 11 vehicles a minute using 
 it. This may be because it was the    
 holiday season and people were coming 
 from Bridlington to visit Hornsea     
 Pottery.                              
 We expected the Hull Road to be busy  
 but during our survey period only an  
 average of 4 vehicles per minute were 
 using it. It would be probably busier 
 in the early morning and late         
 afternoon when people would be        
 travelling to and from work in Hull.  
 The roads leading to Beverley and     
 Withernsea had an average of 7        
 vehicles per minute using them.
