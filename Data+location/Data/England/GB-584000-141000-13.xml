		<title>13Smarden West - The Bell Inn</title>
		<content> The Bell Inn dates back to 1400 and is
 a fine example of the change in the   
 role of the village 'pub' during the  
 last 30 years or so, since so many    
 families now own cars. During the     
 first half of the century when        
 transport was much more difficult,    
 village pubs were chiefly used for the
 local men to go for an evening        
 drinking beer or cider, with the odd  
 traveller coming in for refreshment   
 and finding beer or spirits and a     
 tired sandwich the limit of           
 hospitality. When Ian Turner took over
 the Bell in 1976 it had been used by  
 the locals and occasional outsiders,  
 now it is a popular venue for a good, 
 reasonably priced meal in a really    
 welcoming atmosphere. It has a        
 children's room and serves coffee, and
 even milk, from bars where once only  
 alcoholic drinks could be obtained.   </content>
