		<content> The countryside if this block attracts
many tourists each year. Many of the   
farms of Suffolk now have rooms for    
"Bed and Breakfast" holidays. In Kersey
village has an inn where tourists can  
stay. The water running across the road
at the ford in Kersey makes it a       
popular place to visit. It is a scene  
that is often painted or used in films.
Because a lot of people visit Kersey   
this a lot of people want to live      
there. There is also a restaurant      
opposite the inn. There is also a      
pottery which makes pots and sells     
them.                                  
 Most of the shops and public houses in
this block need people to come and     
visit them from the local towns. The   
buses here only go in the morning and  
afternoon so you need a car to get to  
them.
