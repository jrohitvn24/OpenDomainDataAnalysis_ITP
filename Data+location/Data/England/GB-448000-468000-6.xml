 At 4.30a.m.I was ready to go on my    
 milkround.I had put my school uniform 
 on because I knew I would be late     
 getting back.By the time we had       
 finished it was 8.30a.m.Dad made me my
 breakfast while I gave the cat its.By 
 9a.m.I was in school assembly.Time    
 flew by all day but it had been a very
 boring school day.When I got home I   
 went to the field and saddled up my   
 horse.I got tea at 6.00p.m.because Dad
 had been out.After tea I helped wash  
 up then sat down to watch T.V.There   
 was not a lot on so I switched it off 
 and did my homework.At 8.30p.m.I      
 decided that I would go to bed.
