		<title>12MOUNTAIN RESCUE SERVICES</title>
		<content> This whole area falls under the aegis 
 of the mid-Pennine Accident Panel,    
 with the local Bolton Mountain Rescue 
 Division, comprising some 33 members. 
 This is a voluntary self-funding      
 organisation, though the Police do    
 supply them with radio equipment.  A  
 team of 15 can be called out at any   
 time to assist in rescue operations,  
 such as lost hikers caught out in     
 adverse weather conditions on the     
 moors or people who have fallen       
 down a disused mine shaft.  There have
 also been plane crashes to be located.
 On average they attend two or three   
 calls per year.
