		<content> On Whit Sunday the congregations of   
 the churches walk round their local   
 area in a procession. We do this to   
 show that we are christian and that we
 belive in{GOD.}Whit Sunday is a very  
 enjoy able happy occasion. Each       
 congregation assembles in thier owm   
 church but the churches often meet    
 each other and have a large open air  
 service. The vicar walks at the front 
 of the parade followed by people      
 carrying the church banner. Behind    
 them we have a Rose Queen and her     
 retinue and she is followed by the    
 uniformed organisarion such as cubs , 
 scouts,brownies and guides.The adults 
 from the congregation always walk at  
 the end so that nobody lags behind.   
 Most churches have a band to accompany
 them and often  stop and sing hymns.In
 the old days all children used to have
 new clothes for whitsuntide.          </content>
