		<title>17MR COOPER'S MEMORIES CONT.</title>
		<content>    The roads were made up periodically
 by a{steamroller}grinding flints into 
 the mud with the water cart running on
 in front.Much of this forms the       
 present foundation of the tarmacadam  
 surface.                              
    There was a Blacksmith's Forge     
 where Culverwells now is in New       
 Town.Horses were reshod there and next
 door was the old hand pump used by the
{fire brigade}.Three men each side     
 operated it and the amusing part of   
 the story is that the horse used by   
 the coal merchant had to be           
 commandeered.I can only presume the   
 instructions must have been{'keep it  
{burning until we get there!'.         
 As well as this there was a cattle    
 market which was a real source of     
 interest to us.                       
    I feel there is still a friendly,  
 warm community spirit here.           </content>
