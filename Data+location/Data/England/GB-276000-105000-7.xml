		<title>07History of Morchard Bishop-1</title>
		<content> The village,for hundreds of years was 
 the property of the Bishop of Exeter, 
 who had a large game and deer park    
 here,hence the name Morchard Bishop.  
 The fields and farmhouse to the S.W.  
 of the village are still called The   
 Parks.                                
 There is a local history society,which
 is particularly interested in the     
 structure and development of old      
 vernacular houses and farm buildings, 
 some of which still exist in this     
 area.The farm 'Wood Barton' was the   
 original domesday Manor,and until 1860
 it adjoined the north side of the     
 churchyard. The London Inn was a      
 coaching inn on the turnpike road,    
 outside which is the stone mounting   
 block.Opposite is a building,now      
 converted to housing, which was the   
 collection centre for wool when the   
 woollen industry flourished in Devon. </content>
