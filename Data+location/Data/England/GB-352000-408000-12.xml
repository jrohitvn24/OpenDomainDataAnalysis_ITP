		<title>12Focus on two restaurants.1</title>
		<content>    Considering the size of the        
 population (12,000+) the area seems   
 surprisingly well served by pubs      
 selling food(14), night clubs(2) and  
 restaurants/residential hotels(3).    
 The restaurants in particular were    
 seen as bringing valuable trade into  
 the area, and to test this we         
 qestioned the assistant managers of   
 two of them, The Beeches and          
 Cassinelli's.   They both agreed that 
 proximity of the motorway had         
 contributed to their choice of site.  
 Both had large car parks, and the     
 Beeches reckoned to serve about 800   
 non-residents in an average week,     
 while Cassinelli's expected between 15
 and 16 hundred people.  On a Saturday 
 evening, the most popular time,110    
 would be served at the Beeches, and   
 150-165 at Cassinelli's, but Monday is
 a quiet day.                          </content>
