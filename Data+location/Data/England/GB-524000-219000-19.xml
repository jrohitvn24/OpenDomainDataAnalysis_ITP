		<content> We have a local bus service called    
 Superbuses.  They run regularly and   
 most go to the town centre.  They are 
 driver-operated buses with a flat     
 fare.  There is also a long-distance  
 service.                              
 The old people in the town are looked 
 after.  Many live in sheltered housing
 and they all have free bus passes.    
 Each neighbourhood has doctors' and   
 dentists' surgeries.                  
 Near the golf course, which covers 15 
 acres, is a large garden centre.      
 There is also a small area of water   
 meadow in our area.  It has a stream  
 which floods badly in the winter and  
 sometimes in the summer.  This year   
 the water became polluted and lots of 
 tadpoles, fish and newts died.        
 Between the houses and the farmland is
 a busy railway line to Kings Cross,   
 London.                               </content>
