 We have got one big wood in{MYDDLE},it
 runs all the way down {LOWER ROAD},a  
 lane which runs along the side of{    
{MYDDLE .                              
{ }          {LANDSCAPE                
   The{LANDSCAPE}in{MYDDLE}is mostly   
{FARM LAND}though there is some land   
 with houses on.                       
   Most of the FARM LAND is being      
 grazed and not being cut for silage   
 but the land is being cut for silage  
 further out of the village where the  
 small farmers farm.Only a few people  
 are using land for hay as it is not   
 very popular.They vary in size from   
 about 10 acres to 20 acres.You can not
 see any{OIL SEED RAPE}and there are   
 very few corn fields.There are two    
 fields that are newly seeded but there
 may be more.                          
                                       </content>
