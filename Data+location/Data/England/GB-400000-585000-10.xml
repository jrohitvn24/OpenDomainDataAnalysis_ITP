		<content> The church was built by Sir John      
 Trveleyan of Wallington in 1842, and  
 stands on the top of the little hill  
 on which the village is built.Many    
 members of the Trevelyan family are   
 buried in the churchyard,which is now 
 full,so that the community also has a 
 cementary just outside the village.   
 Until 1978 a vicar lived in the       
 village,since then the vicar has been 
 shared with two neighbouring          
 parishes.There is normally one service
 in the church every Sunday not always 
 at athe same time.There are 20-30     
 names on the electoral roll ot the    
 church,average attendance at each     
 service is about 10.Thee is a         
 parochial church council responsible  
 for the running of the church,care of 
 the building and grounds raising funds
 for the church's share of the vicar's 
 stipend and expenses.                 </content>
