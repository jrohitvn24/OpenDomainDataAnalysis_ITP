		<content>    Farming in our area is very mixed. 
 There are dairy farms with sheep,     
 bullocks and also a corn harvest.     
 Although most of the land is grassland
 more and more corn crops are being    
 grown. Fields vary from 1 or 2 acres  
 to 35.                                
    Mr.Pugsley's farm at Whitefield    
 was mentioned in Domesday and is one  
 of the largest with 520 acres.At the  
 moment there are 900 sheep,600 lambs  
 and 120 cattle.They grow barley and   
 make silage and hay,employing 4 people
 in all.                               
    In the Domesday entry of 1086, 2   
 Men At Arms held Whitefield from      
 Robert and there were 3 slaves, 4     
 villagers and 7 smallholders living   
 there.Woodland as now was noted as    
 well as meadow and pasture. 100 sheep 
 were counted as were 5 cattle,3 pigs, 
 and 10 goats.It was valued at 30s.    </content>
