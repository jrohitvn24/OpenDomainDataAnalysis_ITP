		<title>02THE CHURCH</title>
		<content> In many villages,the importance of the
{church}has rapidly deteriorated.We are
 pleased to say that this is not the   
 case in Whitbourne.The church still   
 plays a{very important}part in the    
 life of this village.Young and old    
 alike go to church in order to worship
 and enjoy the many services           
 provided.The church is a{meeting place
 for people as well as being an old and
{beautiful building}to look at.The     
 church and the school have strong     
 links.The Rector comes into school    
 regularly to take assemblies and teach
 us about Jesus.We use the church for  
 our{school services}at various times  
 of the year.Many of the children are  
 in the{choir}and there is also a group
 of people who learn the art of{bell_  
{ringing.}The church is a place for    
 worship but it's influence is         
 recognised all through the village.   </content>
