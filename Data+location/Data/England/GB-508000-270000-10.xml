		<title>10EMPLOYMENT IN WEST CAMBS.</title>
		<content>     Many of those who work in the area
 are engaged in agriculture, as farmers
 or farmworkers, or in producing animal
 food.   Agricultural workers usually  
 live close to the farms, whereas the  
 mill employees travel in from other   
 areas.                                
     Self-employed residents include a 
 carpenter, a mobile greengrocer, a    
 shop interior designer and an importer
 of ladies' underwear.   However, most 
 of the inhabitants are employed in    
 other areas, commuting to London and  
 other major towns, or working as area 
 managers or sales representatives.    
     There are few opportunities for   
 young people to find work locally, and
 many move away to seek employment.  In
 particular, those who leave to obtain 
 further education or professional     
 qualifications seldom return.
