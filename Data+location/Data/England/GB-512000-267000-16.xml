   {The Nature  Reserve} on the Western
 boundary of Grafham Water has been    
 established to provide a sanctuary for
 wild life and covers some 370 acres.  
 It is open to the public at any time, 
 but the hide, from which the water    
 fowl can be observed, is only open on 
 Sundays when a member of the          
 Bedfordshire and Huntingdonshire      
 Naturalists' Trust, who supervise the 
 reserve, is present to give advice and
 help.                                 
  {Footpaths}follow the perimeter of   
 the reserve and provide a rewarding   
 insight into the wildlife of the area.
   In the{hedgerows}small birds and    
 animals abound.Wild roses and brambles
 have been introduced to provide       
 berries for winter feeding as do      
 hawthorn and sloe bushes.
