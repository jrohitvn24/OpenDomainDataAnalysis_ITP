		<content>  Cows are housed in cubicles or a     
 covered yard during winter,with straw 
 as bedding.Cows have a 9 month        
 gestation;some farms keep their own   
 bull and some use the local Artificial
 Insemination centre.Most calves are   
 born from August to November.Higher   
 prices are paid for milk at this time 
 and harvest work is finished.         
  Farming could not be carried out     
 today without machinery:milking       
 machines,bulk tank refrigerators,     
 tractors with yard scrapers,loaders   
 and manure spreaders,mowers,foragers, 
 trailers for silage and balers for hay
 and straw.                            
  Poultry for Christmas is a small     
 industry in the area:turkeys(weighing 
 10_25 lb) and chickens(8_15 lb),both  
 white feathered;also a few ducks and  
 geese. Locally milled animal feeds are
 available.                            </content>
