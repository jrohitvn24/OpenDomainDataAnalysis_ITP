		<content>{HARTALOO FARM }My uncle is a dairy    
 farmer,he has 190 milking cows. The   
 average yield is about 1,130000 litres
 per year. 25% stock is either sold or 
 slaughtered each year.The food he uses
 is grass in the summer and dairy cake 
 in the  winter.All the milk is taken  
 by milktankers to Maelor for the Milk 
 Marketing Board. The average price he 
 buys a milking cow is about Â£550.Last 
 winter it took one and a quarter hours
 to milk ten cows because the milk     
 froze as it came from the cows into   
 the jars. Normally to milk all the    
 cows takes 3 hours in the morning and 
 2 hours in the evening.He  enjoys his 
 job in the summer but not in winter.
