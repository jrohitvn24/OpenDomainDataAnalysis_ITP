		<content> This 3 x 4km block lies 6km south of  
 Canterbury, west of the A2 London to  
 Dover trunk road, and is situated on  
 the Downs, north of the Elham Valley. 
 Under the Kent Structure Plan, it is  
 part of an area designated as: North  
 Downs Special Landscape Area; Area of 
 Great Landscape Value, and Kent Downs 
 Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.   
 It is undulating in character with    
 land rising and falling 100m (from 35 
 - 135m above sea level) producing a   
 gentle rolling countryside with small 
 valleys where the gradient is steeper.
 It contains the civil parishes of     
 Bishopsbourne and Kingston and small  
 sections of Barham and Bridge. The two
 main centres of population are the    
 villages of Bishopsbourne and Kingston
 with small hamlets at Marley and Pett 
 Bottom, and isolated farms scattered  
 throughout the area.                  </content>
