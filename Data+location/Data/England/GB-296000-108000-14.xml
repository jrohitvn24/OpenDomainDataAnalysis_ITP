		<title>14     AN INTERVIEW</title>
		<content>   One of the residents we interviewed 
  was Mrs  Wills who has only been     
  living in Butterleigh for a few      
  years. However she does not feel a   
  newcomer because everybody is so     
  friendly.                            
   Mrs Wills told us about a stream    
  that runs down the side of the       
  village.Some old people can remember 
  their grans telling them how they    
  used to wash their clothes at the old
  well.When a water strike was on a    
  year or two ago.They had to collect  
  their water from a water lorry.Some  
  people have their own wells so they  
  could collect their water easily.    
  Mrs Wills told us that either they   
  had a water shortage or too much     
  water sometimes.                     
   Mrs Wills enjoys walking to Tiverton
  with her dog through the lanes.This  
  is about 6 miles altogether.         </content>
