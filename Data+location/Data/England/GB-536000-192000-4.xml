		<title>04THE HUNTING LODGE,CHINGFORD</title>
		<content>  Epping Forest was a royal hunting    
 ground where the deer were preserved  
 for the kings and queens to hunt.In   
 1540 Henry VIII bought more land at   
 Chingford to make a royal park.       
  Henry,who loved hunting,became too   
 fat to ride after deer and so had to  
 remain in his "great stone deigne" or 
 standing,now called the Hunting Lodge 
 on the hill above Chingford Plain,    
 where the royal party could assemble  
 to watch the hunt or shoot deer which 
 were driven towards them.             
  The lodge was completed in 1543.All  
 joints and nails were made of wood.   
  When Queen ElizabethI became Queen   
 she preferred to hunt from the lodge  
 and it became known as the Hunting    
 Lodge.The story is that she rode up   
 the staircase on horseback when the   
 Spanish Armada were defeated.The lodge
 is now a museum open to the public.   </content>
