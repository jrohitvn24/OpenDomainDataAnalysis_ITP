		<content> FASHION IN STAMFORD.                  
 In Stamford it costs a lot to stay in 
 with the latest fashions. The 'in'    
 colours this summer are pale oranges, 
 greens and blues. An outfit of a      
 blouse and skirt would cost about Â£20 
 from a fashion shop in Stamford and   
 those that there are are quite        
 expensive, so many people shop in     
 nearby Peterborough.                  
                                       
 A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A SCHOOL BOY.    
 (By Matthew Rushton and Dominic Smith)
 My Dad wakes me at 7.15, I put on my  
 school uniform which is a grey shirt, 
 black trousers, tie and a blazer. I   
 hurry downstairs and and have         
 breakfast with my family before racing
 out to catch the bus. Once I get to   
 school I go to chapel and the we start
 our lessons. I have 7 lessons in the  
 day, 3 before break, 2 before dinner  </content>
