		<title>11Colhayne Farm</title>
		<content> This farm is sited about \ mile from  
 the A35 down a track which eventually 
 leads to Umborne. Running the farm are
 Mr &amp; Mrs Hurford (jun), Mr Hurford    
 (Sen) and a single farm hand. It is   
 mainly dairy (Fresians) 50 cows and 20
 young stock imported for fattening.   
 Turkeys are reared as a Christmas     
 extra and a few sheep are grazed for  
 half the year. There are two farm     
 houses (the original and a new house  
 for the older Hurfords), a milking    
 parlour, silage pits, hay sheds and   
 winter accomodation for the cattle.   
 The fields are both on the slopes of  
 the Umborne valley and in the valley  
 bottom. The railway line cuts through 
 the farmland.(approximately 80        
 acres).Recently two holiday           
 accomodations have been converted from
 farm barns.                           
                                       </content>
