		<title>03The site of Gorleston.</title>
		<content> The origional site of the town lay in 
 linear form along the present High    
 Street just above the old cliff line  
 of the River Yare and also on the     
 slightly higher land just above the   
 bend of the harbour's mouth. Gorleston
 centre, where the present library is, 
 lies at the junction of the High      
 Street with Baker Street and Church   
 Lane, which run from the West along a 
 very shallow valley towards the river.
 Another such valley is followed by    
 England's Lane, to the South. As the  
 town has grown it has spread onto the 
 undulating plain of glacial boulder   
 clay and outwash sands of the Isle of 
 Lothingland rising gently to about ten
 or fifteen metres above sea level.
