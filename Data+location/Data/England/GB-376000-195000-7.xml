		<title>07FARMING AROUND DURSLEY</title>
		<content>   Surrounding the town of Dursley are 
 large areas of fields and woods. The  
 land is used mainly for cattle        
 farming, with some arable farming.    
 Beef cattle are bought and sold at    
 Gloucester market about 12 miles away 
 and milk from the dairy farms is taken
 to the Milk Marketing Board depot at  
 Stonehouse about 10 miles away.       
   One local farmer on the outskirts of
 Dursley farms on fields which have    
 been in his family since the beginning
 of the century. Roads and paths on the
 farm were laid out at that time with  
 waste material taken from the blast   
 furnaces ofa nearby factory. His work 
 is mainly beef cattle rearing. It is a
 family concern with casual help being 
 employed only occassionally.
