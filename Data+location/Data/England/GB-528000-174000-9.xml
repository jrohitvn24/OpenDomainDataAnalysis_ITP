		<title>09Going Shopping.</title>
		<content>   do not like it when my mum's always 
saying when's your baby due and so on. 
And when I'm out shopping I hate       
walking about, then I'd say " mum can  
we go home to watch my favourite       
programme" she would say " I'm just    
going in that shop and that's all"     
when  I stand outside waiting with two 
heavy  bags in my hands.  My favourite 
shop is Morleys. I go to Brixton for   
Morleys. Morleys is a toy shop. When I 
go in it's like toy land.  I like it   
when I go to the pie mash shop to eat, 
my mum hates it when we go to the pie  
and mash shop and I love it. When I go 
in it's like a hotel. When I get home  
I go out in the passage and take my    
topwear off and go to sleep on the     
couch, I have a very long sleep for    
about two hours.
