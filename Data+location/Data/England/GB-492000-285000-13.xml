		<content> Mr Pickering aged 69 yrs has lived in 
 Brigstock for 35 years. Born in       
 Kettering and married for 47 years he 
 has three children: Alison is working 
 in Paris, David in Cornwall and Lesley
 lives in the village.  He worked in   
 British Steel and was made redundant  
 in 1980. His house was converted from 
 a wheelwright's barn. He says that    
 village life has changed during the   
 past 35 years. There are no cows in   
 the street, but much more heavy       
 traffic. Years ago the Sunday joint   
 was taken and cooked in the local     
 bakehouse while they were in church   
 and collected afterwards. While he was
 working it was heartwarming to see the
{Corby Candle}glowing in the night sky.
 He reads the Daily Express and the    
 local {Evening Telegraph.}
