		<title>17Getting Ready for School</title>
		<content>  Most of us rise between 0700 and 0800
We dress ready for school, and wash    
before breakfast, though some wait     
until afterwards to clean their teeth  
after eating. Those of us with pets    
feed them and make sure that they are  
all right. Some of us help Mum in      
getting breakfast ready.               
  Cereal, toast and a drink is the     
normal breakfast, though one or two    
have bacon and egg. We nearly all have 
fruit juice as well as a hot drink,    
mostly tea.                            
  After breakfast we while away the    
time until we need to go to school by  
watching television. Those of us who   
take packed lunches to school usually  
prepare it ourselves.                  
  When Mum is ready she will drive us  
to school, though some of us travel in 
a Mini-bus, to arrive by 0900. A few of
us who live nearby walk to school.     </content>
