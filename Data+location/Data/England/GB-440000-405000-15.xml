		<title>15A Wild Flower Hunt.</title>
		<content> At the end of June we went on a wild  
 flower hunt around school. I saw 8    
 different kinds of flowers altogether.
 On the school field and lawn I saw{   
{creeping buttercup}and{common daisy.} 
 On the cart-track down to the         
 allotments I saw{common chickweed,    
{shepherd's purse, scented mayweed,    
{pineappleweed}and{cow parsley.}There  
 was lots of{cow parsley.}             
 At the edge of the playground I saw   
 some{groundsel.}                      
 Three weeks later we saw that the{cow 
{parsley}flowers had died, but we saw  
 some different flowers. By the        
 cart-track we saw some{rosebay        
{willowherb, foxgloves, hedge mustard} 
 and{Oxford ragwort.}By the side of the
 playground we saw some{spear thistles}
 growing.                              
                                       
                                       </content>
