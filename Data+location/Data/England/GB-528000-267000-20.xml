		<title>20CATS AND DOGS,FENSTANTON</title>
		<content>       Down {FENSTANTON ROAD,HILTON,}  
 there are some{KENNELS}and a{CATTERY. 
 If the pets owners go on holiday they 
 put their pets in the{KENNELS}or the{ 
{CATTERY}.Sylvia and Tony Dighton are  
 the owners.The buildings are quite big
 and opened 4 years ago in 1981.       
       As well as cats and dogs there  
 are a few horses.You can hire a horse 
 and learn to ride it.The{COMMONEST    
 dog is the{springer spaniel}at the    
 kennels.The{oldest dog}they had was a 
 small black mongrel who was 19 years  
 old.                                  
       The{cats}have their own IGLOOS  
 to sleep in.On the doors there are    
 labels with the cats or dogs name on. 
 This identifies them so they do not   
 get muddled up with other cats and    
 dogs.                                 
       They also clip,comb and wash the
 animal if the owners want them to be. </content>
