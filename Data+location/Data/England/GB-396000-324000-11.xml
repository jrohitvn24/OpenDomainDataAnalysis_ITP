		<title>11  WYCHDON LODGE.</title>
		<content>  Wychdon Lodge was built in 1842,     
the early victorian era, by William    
Moore, a banker who also built the     
nearby Saltworks.                      
  The lodge is situated close to a     
small village, called Shirleywich, near
the A51.                               
  The site consists of seven bedrooms, 
two bathrooms, five downstair rooms,   
and a cellar.The remaining servant     
quarters were demolished apart from the
Butler's pantry which is now used as a 
kitchen.                               
 In 1939, during the first             
World War,  soldiers stayed at Wychdon 
Lodge for a short period of time, in   
which valuables were damaged           
particulary at the old Grange. This can
still be seen today.     Wychdon Lodge 
was once a major part ofthe local      
history but in recent years has        
decreased in importance.               </content>
