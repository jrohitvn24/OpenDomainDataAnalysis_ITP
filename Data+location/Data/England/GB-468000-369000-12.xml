		<title>12FARMING</title>
		<content> There are a number of farms within the
 area, incorporating arable, mixed and 
 dairy farms. The main dairy cattle    
 bred in the area are Fresians and     
 Dairy Shorthorns with between 300 and 
 500 head of cattle per farm. The crops
 grown include sugar beet,potatoes, oil
 seed rape, wheat and barley.          
 The four farmers interviewed for this 
 project work nearly 1700 acres of     
 land but they only employ 16 men.     
 All the farms have been in existence  
 for many years, indeed some of the    
 farm houses are over 200 years old.
