		<title>11Surface Water:Chilterns.</title>
		<content> There is not much surface water in our
 area because of the underlying chalk  
 of the{Chiltern Hills.                
 The{River Wye}passes through the south
 of the area on its way to the{River   
{Thames}at{Bourne End.}The{Wye}has been
 channelled into a concrete duct in    
 places. Although it once supplied     
 power to the local paper mills. It is 
 now a shallow, slow flowing stream    
 less than 4m wide.                    
 The{Back Stream,}which was formerly a 
{mill stream,}and now acts as an       
 overflow from the{Dyke,}flows through 
 the{Lagoon}which is part of the{sewage
{works.}It passes close to the{river   
{Wye.}The{Back Stream}and{Lagoon}are   
 very interesting because each have a  
 natural spring emerging from the      
 bedrock and coming to the surface of  
 the water.                            
                                       </content>
