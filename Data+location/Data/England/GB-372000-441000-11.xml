		<title>11CLITHEROE CRICKET CLUB</title>
		<content>    The cricket grounds consist of a   
 netball court, bowling green, squash  
 club, three tennis courts and the     
 cricket field. There is also a club   
 house with changing rooms. The first  
 cricket club house was demolished in  
 1933. A new club house was then built 
 and opened in 1935 at a cost of Â£900. 
 The money was collected by private    
 subscription and social efforts.      
    Cricket practices are held on      
 Monday and Thursday. Tennis and       
 netball can be played at any time of  
 the week. The bowling green is in the 
 corner and is mainly used by the older
 generation. The netball courts are    
 normally used for matches, but the    
 tennis  courts are often full up.     
    The membership for the Cricket Club
 is Â£14 for one year, the Tennis Club  
 is Â£7 and Squash Club is Â£48.
