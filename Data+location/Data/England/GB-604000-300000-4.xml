		<title>04LIFESTYLE MILLER'S LIFE.</title>
		<content> This account of a miller's life was   
 written during Mr. Denis Wade's       
 retirement. He died in 1973.He worked 
 in the mill at Wicklewood from 1908 to
 1942. When he left school at the age  
 of 14 he found a daily job of sweeping
 the mill from top to bottom. He took  
 with him a spider frightener, which   
 was made from a broomhandle and a     
 bundle of twigs tied together with    
 string. This was used to clear the    
 cobwebs and spiders from the rafters. 
  The millers would grind between 35   
 and 40 coombe of grain in about 10    
 hours. If the wind did not blow until 
 after tea they would continue grinding
 until 4 o'clock in the morning.       
  In 1911 an iron headwheel was        
 fitted.Denis and his brother painted  
 the mill from a boatswains'chair. The 
 mill ceased production in 1942.
