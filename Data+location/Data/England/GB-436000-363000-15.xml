		<title>15Clay Cross Tunnel</title>
		<content>   The Clay Cross Tunnel was begun in  
 February 1837 and was completed in    
 August 1839.The Tunnel is 1 and       
 a quarter kilometers long.The people  
 who built the Tunnel were called      
 navvies,masons and brick layers.      
 The navvies,who lived in sod          
 huts,were paid on contract,according  
 to the work they  did.Others  were    
 paid in bread and beer.               
  The tunnel has 15,000,000 bricks.    
 Clay dug out of the tunnel was used to
 make bricks.Coal found in the tunnel  
 heated the kilns to fire bricks.The   
 kilns were in or along side the       
 tunnel.There are air shafts all over  
 Clay Cross. Air shafts were used to   
 let steam or smoke out of the Tunnel. 
 The Tunnel was built as part of the 72
 mile stretch of the Leeds Derby       
 railway,and is still standing and in  
 use today.                            </content>
