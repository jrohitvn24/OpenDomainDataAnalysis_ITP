		<title>07CHARLBURY RAILWAY STATION</title>
		<content>  Charlbury Railway Station is just    
outside the town centre on the main    
line from London to Worcester.It is a  
small,compact and attractive building  
which has a fish pond and a garden on  
the single platform.                   
  This station which was erected by    
the Great Western Railway was designed 
by Isambard Kingdom Brunel the famous  
railway engineer.It is,therefore,one   
of the oldest station buildings in the 
country. It is made of wood,is painted 
cream and brown and it has won an award
recently for the best kept station in  
this area.                             
  The track, as it runs through the    
station is single but it becomes       
double track at Ascott under Wychwood  
on the way to Worcester,and as it      
approaches Oxford on the way to        
London.                                
                                       </content>
