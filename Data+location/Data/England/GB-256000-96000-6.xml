		<content>   In{Brightley}there used to be a     
 monastery.The small citizen priory    
 was founded by Richard Pitz Baldwin in
 1133.In 1136 twelve superior monks    
 arrived from Waverley Abbey but the   
 death of their first prior,together   
 with the{damp climate}discouraged them
 so much they moved to Forde Abbey in  
 Tavistock in 1141.                    
   King Henry 8th sacked all the       
 monasteries so the monks went to the  
 Isles of Scilly. Then the{monastery   
 became a farm. Inside the piggery     
 there is still the arch from the      
 monastery. There was a mill too at the
 same time as the farm but it is now a 
{toy factory.} There are still the old 
 mill stones but they are used for     
 steps now. In a field opposite the    
 factory Roman soldiers have been seen 
 marching then they disappear.
