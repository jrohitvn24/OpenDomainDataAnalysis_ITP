		<title>18LOCAL NEWS HOSP. TO CLOSE(2)</title>
		<content> The Local Health Authority says Thope 
 Maternity Hospital must go because it 
 is isolated from the maternity        
 services at Sunderland and this does  
 cause travel problems for anaethetists
 consultants and paedatrictians.       
         The M.P. for Easington said   
 the location is ideal and it would be 
 highly inconvenient and to expensive  
 for expectant mothers to travel to    
 Sunderland and Hartlepool.The reasons 
 given by Sunderland Health Authority  
 for closing the hospital,were said to 
 be unconvincing.                      
         The Health Authority's report 
 did admit that travelling times would 
 be longer,fares more expensive for    
 patients but it stated that the       
 facilities at Sunderland District     
 Hospital and the Cameron Hospital in  
 Hartlepool would be extended at a cost
 of Â£1.5 million.                      </content>
