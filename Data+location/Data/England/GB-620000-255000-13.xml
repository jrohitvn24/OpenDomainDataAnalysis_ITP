  Mr.Percy Edwards has lived in Otley  
for a number of years.He is,of         
course,best known for his bird and     
animal impressions.Although he is now  
past the normal retirement age he is   
still in great demand and consequently 
spends much of his time away from      
Otley.His home and garden are carefully
designed so that he can attract birds  
and other wildlife.Indeed his garden   
was recently featured on the television
programme,GARDENERS WORLD.It was noted 
then as a haven for wild birds.
