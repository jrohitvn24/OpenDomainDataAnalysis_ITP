		<content> Some of these fields have odd names   
 like_Owld Dicks Field,Long Dicks      
 Field,Taylor's and Peets.The ditches  
 drain the surplus water into the back 
 drain.When the corn has been dried in 
 the bins it goes to make animal food. 
 The potatoes and other vegatables go  
 to market to be sold.Nowadays they use
 tractors for ploughing and working the
 land to make it ready for the         
 crops.they have a seeder for sowing   
 carrots,onions,beetroot etc.they also 
 have a carrot and potato harvester.In 
 the old days they had no tractors_ all
 the work was done by horses.My Nan    
 says some of the changes are for the  
 better but some are for the worse.Only
 a few people are needed to work a     
 farm.They like farming but it is a 7  
 day week job.
