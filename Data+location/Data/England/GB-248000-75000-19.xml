		<content>  The school was started by Miss Ashwin
 in Whitchurch in a house called       
 Greystones.It was then called St.     
 Aubyns and was a girls only school.   
 Then the school was bought by two     
 Misses Raymond and another building   
 bought in Devonport which was called  
 St. Michael's Lodge and boys were     
 admitted.As the school was in both    
 buildings some of the staff went by   
 train from Tavistock to Plymouth      
 during the lunch hour.About 1930 the  
 school was divied into two separate   
 schools.In 1933 Miss Potts became     
 headmistress of the Tavistock school  
 and it moved to Plymouth Road.Miss    
 Gilbert,a teacher at St.Michael's,was 
 a pupil there when Miss Potts was     
 headmistress.Miss Gilbert remembers   
 that they were taught subjects no     
 longer taught such as geolgy,Greek    
 History and eurhythmics.              </content>
