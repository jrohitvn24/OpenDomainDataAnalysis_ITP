		<title>06THE METEOROLOGICAL COLLEGE</title>
		<content>  The Meteorolgical College is a place 
 where they teach students to become   
 meteorolgoists.The original house on  
 the Shinfield Park site was owned by  
 a whisky merchant and in the 1940's   
 the R.A.F. took it over as a training 
 college for air crews. It started as a
 M.E.T. college in 1971 financed by the
 government. There are about 100       
 students and 20 teachers. Some of the 
 equipment used are things such as the 
 rainfall measuring computer, the      
 electronic thermometer, the wind speed
 and direction machine, and barometers.
 The college is also linked to the     
 12,000,000 pound computer at the      
 Bracknell Meteorological Centre. The  
 students access it for training       
 purposes. The college also has a      
 number of its own micros. It offers   
 different courses for students from   
 all over the world.                   </content>
