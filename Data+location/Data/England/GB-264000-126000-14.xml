 Mr. Cyril Williams interview          
 continued.                            
 He did not get much in the toy line to
 play with.  He had very little pocket 
 money to spend, but what he got went a
 long way.  In answer to the question  
 "Are the schools different today?" he 
 replied "Yes, very much different.    
 Children today are very lucky and     
 should make use of all their          
 privileges.  School would start at 9  
 o'clock.  Ten minutes for lunch, and  
 one hour for dinner.  Finish at 3.45. 
 Many children had to walk home many   
 miles.  There were no buses to take   
 them to and fro.  There would be two  
 rest breaks in school during lessons."
