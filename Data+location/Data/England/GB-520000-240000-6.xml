		<content> KEEP FIT - This is a weekly one hour  
 session in the village hall run by a  
 local lady. About a dozen women of    
 differing ages work out with dance and
 stretching movements to popular music.
 Most people know each other so the    
 atmosphere is often light hearted and 
 even hilarious with everyone working  
 hard but at their own pace and        
 hopefully becoming more supple in the 
 process!                              
 THE WOMEN'S INSTITUTE - 40 ladies of  
 Hinxworth and Edworth belong to the   
 W.I.  We meet monthly in the village  
 hall to discuss W.I. matters, listen  
 to a speaker on anything from cookery 
 to self-defence, and end with tea and 
 cakes. The W.I. offers friendship,    
 relaxation and entertainment. We hold 
 coffee mornings, jumble sales and even
 go carol singing for charity.
