		<title>03St. Andrew's Church, Banwell</title>
		<content> In AD704 the first wooden church was  
 built by St. Aldhelm. The village was 
 preserved during successive plagues by
 the clear water of the Mendip spring. 
 Banwell prospered and a fine stone    
 church was built. Bishop Beckington   
 was largely involved in beautifying   
 the church. In the 20th century       
 electric light and oil fired heating  
 was installed, a new organ was built  
 in 1935 and the number of bells       
 increased to ten.                     
    Today, worship is family orientated
 so that people of all ages can come   
 together. The children's choir of     
 approximately 24 is shortly to be     
 augmented by adults to produce a more 
 balanced choir. The Mothers' Union    
 continues to meet and there is a      
 flourishing Scripture Union Group     
 attracting membership of all ages.
