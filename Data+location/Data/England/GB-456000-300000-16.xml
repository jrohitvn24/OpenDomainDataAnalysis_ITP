		<content>      It should be noted that in the   
 whole of this area there is no Hyper  
 Market and not even a really large    
 Super Market. Shops appear right along
 2 of the major roads:- A50 and B5366  
 (Saffron Lane) where they pick up     
 custom from passing traffic as well as
 from local people; but the A426 shops 
 are concentrated in the area of Old   
 Ayleston village while the A46 in this
 area is all houses. The largest       
 concentration of shops is on 'Queens  
 Road' and is NOT on a major Trunk     
 Road. It has a reputation for quality 
 and was set up to serve{Clarendon Park
 and{Knighton}when they were built.    
      In the main residential areas,   
 small local shops still exist on their
 own or in small groups of 3 or 4.     
 These tend to sell food and essentials
 or to be Newsagents, Off Licences or  
 Take Away Hot Food Shops.             </content>
