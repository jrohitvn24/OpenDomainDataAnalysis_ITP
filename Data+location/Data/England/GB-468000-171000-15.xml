 contribution to the{West Reading      
{festival.}We were very busy all week, 
 the whole school helped prepare and   
 people in the area came to join in on 
 the Wednesday afternoon .there were   
 all kinds of things _raffle,face      
 painting,dancing and lots of stalls   
 with games.Most things were free and  
 those that weren't, were only 2p for  
 children.There were dances from all   
 over the world.I did some country     
 dancing and feeling tests.My friend   
 Simmi did some Indian dancing,she     
 looked very pretty.I had my face      
 painted by a mum.All the money went to
 Helen House.
