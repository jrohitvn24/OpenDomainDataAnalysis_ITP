		<content> The results of our survey in the area 
 showed that many people were concerned
 about the standard of life in their   
 area. There were problems caused by   
 vandals, and graffiti written on      
 walls and in subways.  Noise was      
 another problem, many people          
 complained about it at night as the   
 container berth at the docks started  
 work. Fouling of pavements by dogs and
 litter were also a problem. Speeding  
 cars and the use of roads by learner  
 drivers also caused problems,         
 especially as there are a large number
 of old age pensioners and old peoples 
 homes in the area.
