		<content>{AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT DEALER-MARTON  
 The firm which has been run by five   
 generations of the same family has    
 grown and developed with the needs of 
 mainly local farmers. It is one of ten
 similar establishments in Cheshire.   
  The firm supplies and services all   
 types of agricultural machinery,      
 including tractors as well as selling 
 garden equipment and clothing. They   
 also repair farm implements and run a 
 hire service.                         
  Eight people are employed at the     
 depot,two of them in an administrative
 capacity. Pay, on average, is Â£100 per
 week. Business is steady, if not brisk
 with about 20 customers per day. The  
 business is expanding (a new show room
 is to be built) partly as a result of 
 stricter safety regulations on farms, 
 meaning better maintenance of         
 equipment.Exports are now common.     </content>
