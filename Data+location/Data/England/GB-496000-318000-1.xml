 road.It is a small compact village    
 built mainly around the castle        
 mound.It has been designated a        
 conservation area for some time.As    
 will be seen from the land cover      
 survey much of the block is given over
 to mixed farming, mainly arable       
 together with sheep and a few         
 cattle.St.James church is the oldest  
 building still existing parts of      
 which date from 1115.Close by the     
 church is the school .This is a       
 Junior, Infant school taking children

 there were 45 pupils in all.There are 
 two public houses _The Fox &amp; Hounds   
 and The Castle.In Pinfold road there  
 is a village shop with a Post Office .
