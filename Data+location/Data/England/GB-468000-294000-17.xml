		<content>{BAD EGGS                              
   One ball is needed in this game for 
 any number of players. The person who 
 is 'on' chooses a subject and the     
 other players shout out their         
 favourite part of that subject. The   
 one who is 'on' calls one of those out
 and throws the ball in the air. The   
 chosen person has to catch the ball   
 while the others run away. Once the   
 chosen person has the ball, he shouts 
 'Bad Eggs' and everybody stops. If he 
 can hit someone with the ball, they   
 get a bad egg and they are 'on'       
 instead. If he fails, he gets a bad   
 egg himself. When somebody gets two   
 bad eggs, everyone lines up and makes 
 a tunnel with their legs. The victim  
 goes through and everybody 'knees'    
 him. The game then starts again.
