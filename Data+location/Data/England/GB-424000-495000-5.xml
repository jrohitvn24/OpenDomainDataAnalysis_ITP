		<content> On Saturday 13th July 1985,one week   
 before Saint Anne's Tide,{Catterick   
{Village Fair}was held on Low Green.   
 The Fair was opened at 2.00pm by the  
{Rose Queen,}who arrived by pony and   
 trap and made a speech. Local girls   
 aged 10 years and over can enter the  
{Rose Queen Competition.}They have to  
 read a passage from a book,and answer 
 questions asked by a panel of         
 judges.This year a Rose Queen and two 
 attendants were chosen.               
 Around Low Green about twenty tents   
 were loaned and errected by the R.A.F.
 The tents contained stalls and games  
 organised by village groups. There was
 a children's fancy dress competition, 
 and a dancing display by children from
 Michael Syddall C.E. Primary School.  
 The total raised was over Â£1,500. This
 is the major annual fund raising event
 for the{Parish Church.                </content>
