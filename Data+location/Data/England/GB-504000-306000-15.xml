		<content> This stone built and thatch roofed    
 Public House was built in 1640. Its   
 name was given by the family who used 
 to live in Uffington House. It is     
 managed by Mr John Bailey- he and his 
 wife work long hours to provide       
 excellent service. 7 other people are 
 also employed here. Around 4 barrels  
 of beer (each 54 gallons) are consumed
 each week. Home made meals are        
 provided- steak and mushroom pie being
 the most popular. About 100 younger   
 and 60 older regulars drink there, but
 passing traffic provides most of the  
 trade. Recently the pop group "The    
 Grumbleweeds" called in for a meal.   
 During renovations in 1969 60 gold    
 coins were found under the front door.
 The roof was re-thached in 1984 at a  
 cost of Â£10,000 and it is expected to 
 last 30 years.
