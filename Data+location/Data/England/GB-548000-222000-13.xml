		<title>13Village shopping.</title>
		<content> The growth of Stansted Mountfitchet   
 has meant that there are now two      
 shopping areas.Both centres are on the
 old part of the village, one based in 
 Chapel Hill and Lower Street and the  
 other alongside Cambridge Rd (B1383). 
 The size of the shopping catchment    
 area is fairly small because of the   
 nearness of the village to the 'urban 
 centres' at Bishop's Stortford and    
 Harlow to the south.                  
 Although facilities include a new     
{'shopping precinct'}for day to day    
 needs of the community, many residents
 prefer to make a weekly visit to the  
 nearest town because of the ease of   
 access and private transport which has
 now had the effect of reducing the    
 importance of the village shopping    
 centres despite the increase of       
 population over the past decade.
