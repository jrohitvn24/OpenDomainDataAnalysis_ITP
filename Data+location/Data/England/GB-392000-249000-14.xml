		<title>14The history of a pint!</title>
		<content> We went round the village asking      
 people if they knew any history of the
 village.                              
                                       
    We found out that there used       
 to be an old{Roman road}running behind
 one of the old farms in Pinvin. We    
 were unable to confirm this as old    
 maps are not easily available.        
                                       
    The Coach and Horses pub was       
 given its name because it was an over 
 night stop to change the horses and to
 have refreshments. The arch still     
 stands today where the old coaches    
 used to pass through.                 
                                       
    The New Inn landlords have found   
 lots of broken bones and pots, as well
 as old{burial grounds}and a well. This
 public house's name seems odd now     
 because it clearly is not a 'new' inn.</content>
