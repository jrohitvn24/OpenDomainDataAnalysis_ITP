		<content>    At present our village suffers from
 very heavy traffic and for many years 
 the villagers have hoped for a        
 by-pass. The County Council have plans
 to build a new road but it will be at 
 least 10 years before completion. The 
 alternative is to have large housing  
 developments, doubling the size of the
 village, and the developers would then
 provide Â£1.5m of the Â£2.25m needed.   
   Ashington was chosen for development
 because it is situated on the main    
 Horsham to Worthing A.24 road and has 
 not had a great deal of building in   
 recent years compared to other nearby 
 towns.                                
    The developer will be allowed to   
 build on 30 acres of land and the     
 regulations state that he must build  
 a variety of types of houses. The     
 effect will be to increase the village
 by 1,100 people in the 450 new homes. </content>
