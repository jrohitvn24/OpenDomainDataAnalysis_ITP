		<title>08INDUSTRY IN SUTON</title>
		<content> Telephone conversation with Mr        
 Nickalls of Suton and visits to       
 Bloomers and Farmhand.                
 Suton is a small scattered rural      
 community looking to Spooner Row for  
 its school, chapel, social life and   
 recreation. However there are several 
 businesses to do with the agricultural
 industry, a builders and Bloomers.    
 Bloomers is run from a 150 acre farm  
 which produces grain and sugar beet.  
 The old farm sheds have been converted
 into a shop and new practical modern  
 buildings used for the corn and       
 machinery. Bloomers is a flower shop  
 and import fresh flowers daily for    
 weddings etc. The more unusual side if
 the business is hiring out artificial 
 plants, trees and floral arrangements 
 to banks, industry, showhouses and TV 
 and stage productions. The trees come 
 from the Far East, flowers from China.</content>
