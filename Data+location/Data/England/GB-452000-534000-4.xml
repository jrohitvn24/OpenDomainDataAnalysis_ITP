		<title>04The Dig at Church Close</title>
		<content>{The Headland-H/pool By Andrew Milburn 
 In{Church Close,}opposite {St.Hilda's 
{Church}there is archaeological dig    
 I went into the display cabin and     
 there were pictures and information   
 about all the different 'digs' in     
 H/Pool.The archaeologists have found  
 foundations of{Medieval Houses.}One of
 these,could have been a merchant's    
 house.A merchant's house had 2 rooms  
 on the ground floor.One of the rooms  
 might have been the living roomand the
 back room,which had a large oven,may  
 have been the kitchen.This part of the
 'dig' is now finished and the builders
 are preparing the land for new        
 development.In the cabin there was a  
 visitor's book.{Visitors come from all
{over the world}to visit this site.Many
 visitors come from{Europe,U.S.A.}and  
 some even come from{Australia. }
