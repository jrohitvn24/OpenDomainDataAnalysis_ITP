		<title>02Housing in Morchard Bishop</title>
		<content> There is a mixture of old,new,private 
 and state housing here.A collection of
 council owned houses is situated at   
 either end of the village and although
 most are rented from the council,some 
 are being purchased by the sitting    
 tenants.A close of some modern 30     
 bungalows was built on the site of the
 old Rectory garden.These are all owner
 occupied.                             
 The east side of Fore Street is made  
 up of an unbroken line of 13          
 two hundred year old thatched         
 cottages, the longest line of unbroken
 thatch in the country.Many of the old 
 cottages in the area have been        
 tastefully restored.These were        
 originally tied cottages sold off by  
 the farmers and the Church.
