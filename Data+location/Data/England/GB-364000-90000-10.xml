		<title>10    Middle Farm Dorchester.</title>
		<content>   Mrs Collins rents the farmhouse at  
 Middle Farm with her family.          
 Previously her father and brother     
 worked on farms. It is really a       
 private house and not used as a farm. 
 The Dutchy of Cornwall owns the farm, 
 so they rent it. It was built in 1885 
 .They don't have any farm animals, or 
 any animals that make products but    
 they do have two guard dogs, seven    
 cats and a donkey. They have a small  
 orchard and goosebery bushes. Although
 the house is very old they still have 
 cellars which are propped up by brick 
 walls so that they won't fall in.     
 There are still hooks where they hung 
 their meat and racks where they kept  
 the wine that they made.Mrs Collins   
 husband has a Gipsy caravan that they 
 take to steam rallys.
