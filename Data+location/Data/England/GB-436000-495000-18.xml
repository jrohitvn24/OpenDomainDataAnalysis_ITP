		<title>18RECREATION IN BROMPTON</title>
		<content> Recreational provision in Brompton is 
 for all ages but there is not a great 
 variety.The parish council has entered
 the village in the'Britain in bloom'  
 competition during 1984 &amp; 1985.Many of
 the team games for adults are         
 organised through the public          
 houses.One of these,quoits,is an old  
 English game played by throwing a     
 metal ring as close to a pin in a     
 square of clay,as possible.Brompton   
 has a thriving soccer team.They have  
 recently lost ther pitch at Stone     
 Cross because the site is being used  
 for new district council offices.For  
 young children there is a play area   
 called the'wreck'.The play equipment  
 consists of a slide,swings,s climbing 
 frame,hobby horse and a football      
 pitch.In June a second play area is   
 set up on the Water End green.
