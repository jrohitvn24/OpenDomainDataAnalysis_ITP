		<title>13A Day in the School Term</title>
		<content> My mother wakes me at 7 am and I go   
 downstairs, tidy up and have my       
 breakfast.  I listen to the radio     
 until about 7.40am when I go upstairs 
 into the bathroom and wash my face and
 brush my teeth. I get dressed in my   
 school uniform which is a navy blue   
 skirt and jumper and a white blouse   
 and school tie.At 8.10, I go to the   
 bus stop. When I get to school, I meet
 my friends and register in my form    
 room. At 9.25am, I go to my first     
 lesson.Lessons last about 40-45 mins  
 and I learn Maths, English, French,   
 Humanities, P.E., Science, Music, Art 
 Home Economics,and Design. I have two 
 lessons, then a break, two more       
 lessons and then an hour for lunch.   
 There are three lessons in the        
 afternoon. School finishes at 3.45 and
 I go home on the bus. I do my homework
 in the evening.    Louise Page  12 yrs</content>
