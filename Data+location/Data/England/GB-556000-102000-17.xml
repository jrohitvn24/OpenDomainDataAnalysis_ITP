		<title>17CHANGE IN WILLINGDON</title>
		<content>   Until the Willingdon By-Pass (the   
 A22) was constructed in 1934, the     
 Eastbourne/London Road ran by way of  
 Wish Hill and Coopers Hill.           
   "The Library Hair Salon" in Wish    
 Hill was a newsagents at one time. Now
 the only place where you can buy a    
 newspaper in Upper Willingdon is the  
 BP Petrol Station at Willingdon       
 Roundabout (on the A22).              
   The Post Office in Wish Hill used to
 be a bakery and tea rooms. The        
 previous Post Office was at "Malthouse
 Cottage", a few doors away. Between   
 the two is "The Malt House", a small  
 restaurant named "The Granary" until  
 last year.                            
   "Five Gables", at the junction of   
 Wish Hill and Church Street, now a    
 private residence, was until recently 
 a language school for foreign         
 students.                             </content>
