		<content>      The area has very few services.  
  There are no schools or shops.The    
 only commercial functions are two     
 public houses and a garage/service    
 station.The Farmers Arms public house 
 in Bishops Cleeve is very popular     
 amongst the farming community.The     
 landlord serves a 'good pint'and it's 
 the place to listen to the real       
 Gloucestershire accent.The locals are 
 always served first!                  
      The absence of services is partly
 explained by geography.None of the    
 area coincides with the centre of any 
 of the villages,and improvements in   
 individual mobility has allowed people
 to travel to larger towns for goods   
 and services.The increase in the      
 number of freezers in homes has       
 allowed families to shop less         
 frequently and to purchase in bulk.
