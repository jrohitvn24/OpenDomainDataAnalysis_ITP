		<title>08CONSTABLE BURTON HALL</title>
		<content>{  Constable Burton Hall}is owned by Mr
 Charles Wyvill,whose ancestors have   
 lived there for many generations. The 
 present house was built by John Carr  
 of York in 1760-68;to replace an      
 earlier Elizabethan house,and was     
 copied from an Italian house by       
 Paladio.                              
                                       
   The house is approached by a double 
 flight of steps to a pillared         
 portico.There is a square entrance    
 hall with matching doors,some of which
 are false.                            
                                       
   In the library are about 2500 books.
 The earliest book there is a Latin    
 text book printed in 1574 and the     
 family also owns a copy of the first  
 folio of William Shakespeare from     
 1700,also a copy of the Domesday Book 
 for Yorkshire printed in 1722.        </content>
