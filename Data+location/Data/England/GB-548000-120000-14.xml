		<content>   The parish church of St. Margaret   
 which stands in the grounds of Buxted 
 Park was very likely built on the site
 of a much earlier church in 1250 A.D. 
 The name is in honour of Margaret     
 Queen of Scotland (1045_1093) the wife
 of Malcolm the King.                  
   The style of architecture is known  
 as Early English and the church has   
 been little altered since it was      
 built.                                
   Since Buxted is a relatively small  
 village it seems surprising that this 
 church is so large. It is because it  
 was the Mother Church of an area which
 included High Hurstwood, Hadlow Down, 
 Uckfield and Crowborough. These areas 
 now make up seven parishes.           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
