		<title>04BOLINGE HILL FARM</title>
		<content> Total area of 400 acres. {Crops &amp;     
{Livestock:}This year's crops are wheat
 132 acres, barley 27 acres, maize 25  
 acres, rape 32 acres and peas 18      
 acres. Weather has had an adverse     
 effect on the crops.  The spring      
 barley was intended to be sold        
 for malting.  Some is of the required 
 standard, the rest of the barley will 
 go to 'intervention' to be stored as  
 part of the European grain mountain.  
 Similarly peas were for human         
 consumption but much of the crop will 
 become cattle feed.  Maize is made    
 into silage for cattle feed and       
 accounts for their good quality beef  
 cattle.  30 Hereford, 124 Charolais,  
 20 Limousin and 6 Simmenthal are      
 reared on the pasture areas. {        
{Mechanisation: }3 workers, 3 tractors 
 with ancillary equipment and 1 combine
 harvester are based on the farm.      </content>
