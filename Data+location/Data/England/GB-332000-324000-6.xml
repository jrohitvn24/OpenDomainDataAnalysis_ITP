		<content> On Monday, April 29th, the Chairman of
 the Parent's Support Group, Mr        
 P.Brown, was interviewed by shropshire
 Radio concerning the non-attendance at
 school of eight pupils. Mr Brown said 
 that they were being educated at home 
 by their parents until the Education  
 Authority re-instated transport for   
 them. He explained that due to the    
 Authority replacing a mini-bus with a 
 taxi,the children would have to walk  
 to school along the busy A.5. trunk   
 road or along lonely country  lanes.  
 James Carr,aged 5, was also           
 interviewed and said "Walking so far  
 makes my legs ache".                  
    On Tuesday B.B.C.Television came to
 yhe school. The Headmaster  was       
 interviewed and film taken of Class 2,
 highlighting the vacant seats of the  
 absent children.
