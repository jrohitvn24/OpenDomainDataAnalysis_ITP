  The radar station at Boulmer is      
 situated just outside our block but   
 has such an influence on our lives    
 that we must include it.Established in
 1945,as an airfield,its function      
 was changed to that of a radar        
 station in 1950.The station employs   
 650 servicemen and also operates a    
 first class air_sea rescue service.The
 quarters at Longhoughton accomodate   
 500 personnel ,which has helped to    
 develop the area.The community centre,
 financed and run by the R.A.F.        
 accomodates a great many clubs and    
 societies,including a playgroup.All   
 these facilities are also used by     
 civilian residents.The local shop or  
 N.A.A.F.I.is also R.A.F.financed and  
 can supply almost everthing from      
 electrical goods to groceries.
