		<content> We are taking the figures for         
{Hexhamshire Low Quarter}, which       
 includes most but not all of our area.
{Population}: 229                      
 Schoolchildren:29  12.6%              
 Working age: 104   45.4%              
 Retired :80        34.9%              
{Number of houses}: 93                 
 2 of these had no inside WC,and 1 had 
 no bath (a big improvement since 1971)
 Only 2 were Council property.         
{Car Ownership  per household:}        
 2 or more cars: 25 (30.5%)            
 1 car:          41 (50%)              
 No car:         16 (19.5%9)           
 (These figures are not surprising as  
 there are only 2 buses to Hexham per  
 week, apart from the School bus, and  
 there is no shop in the area!)        
{Since 1981}, there have been several  
 new houses built,and the population   
 has increased slightly.               </content>
