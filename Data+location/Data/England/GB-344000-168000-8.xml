		<title>08Farming around Nailsea</title>
		<content> Most of the land around Nailsea is    
 given over to{pasture}for dairy cattle
 on small{dairy farms}who sell most of 
 their milk to Horlicks Dairies who    
 have a processing plant in Clevedon   
 and a bottling and distribution depot 
 on the Blackfriars Estate here in     
 Nailsea.                              
 There is, however, one dairy farm in  
 the West End district of Nailsea which
 still processes and bottles its own   
 milk - Biggs Dairies of West End Farm.
 There has been much local concern in  
 recent years over the spread of new   
 housing development in Nailsea which  
 threatens to take over much of the    
 surrounding farmland. People are      
 worried that, eventually, Nailsea and 
 Backwell will merge into one big town 
 if the land near the B.R.Station is   
 used for houses.
