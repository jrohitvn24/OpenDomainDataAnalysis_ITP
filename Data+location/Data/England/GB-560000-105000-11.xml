 The school secretary fortunately can  
 walk to work,she does not have to rely
 on a bus service and she also has a   
 telphone.It would be good to have a   
 village shop once more.Apart from the 
 regular school functions which take   
 place probably the other most         
 noticeable event in this area during  
 the past has been the school's        
 centenary.She likes it in Hankham     
 because it is one of the most peaceful
 part of the area and she hopes it will
 stay that way,although the proposed   
 motorway and new houses will probably 
 make a great difference.It would be   
 nice to have more children in the     
 village
