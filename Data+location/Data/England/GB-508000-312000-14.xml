		<title>14Interview at Village Shop.</title>
		<content> We went to see the village shop       
 in Baston which sells nearly          
 everything we want.The shop keeper has
 always lived here.It is now owned by  
 her brother from Baston. First it used
 to be a bakery then a small shop and  
 Post Office. When her brother took    
 over the shop he knocked a wall down  
 to make the shop bigger. Every        
 Wednesday the shop keeper goes and    
 gets the shops stock. She gets most   
 things from the cah and carry in      
 Peterborough. If she is ill or goes on
 holiday her sister-in-law looks after 
 the shop for her. She likes Baston    
 because she knows all her customers   
 and they are friendly.                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
