		<title>07A FAMILY SUNDAY IN SHIPSTON</title>
		<content>  We interviewed our school secretary  
 Mrs Eldridge about a typical family   
 Sunday.                               
  Mr and Mrs Eldridge and their        
 daughters Sarah aged 7 and Victoria   
 aged 6 moved into a new house in      
 Shipston-on-Stour in 1983.            
  The family rise at 8.00 a.m.,a       
 fraction later than on school days.   
 After breakfast they go swimming.When 
 they return, Mr Eldridge cleans the   
 car,the children play and Mrs Eldridge
 prepares the lunch.                   
  At 2.30 p.m.,they go for a short     
 walk.When they return home they work  
 in the garden.                        
  The children have their baths at 5.00
 p.m.Then they all have a picnic tea   
 brought in on a trolley wheeled by the
 children.The children go to bed at    
 7.30 p.m. while their parents get     
 things ready for Monday.              </content>
