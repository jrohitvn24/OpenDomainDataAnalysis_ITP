		<title>10A Visit to Cambridge.</title>
		<content> On Saturday my brother and I got up at
 8.30,had our breakfast and put on our 
 clothes. We went to feed our pigeons. 
   At ten o'clock my nan and grandad   
 came. They sat down for a cup of tea  
 and a bun. They said that they were   
 late because there was a lot of       
 traffic in{Haddenham.}Then we went out
 with nan and grandad.As we went along{
{Ramsey Forty Foot}we saw a pair of {  
{great crested grebes.}When we arrived 
 at{Cambridge}we parked the car and    
 walked over a bridge near a weir. We  
 walked over the replica of{the Bridge 
{of Sighs,}towards{Trinity College.}We 
 looked at the library designed by{Sir 
{Christopher Wren.}Then we fed the     
 ducks.                                
   You can read more about leisure on
