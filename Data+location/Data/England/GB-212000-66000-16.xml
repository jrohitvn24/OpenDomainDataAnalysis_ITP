		<content> The pews and bench ends are the       
{original}ones.The carvings are of     
 animals,human heads and even a 3-faced
 Celtic God.One of the brasses is dated
 1777 but the one in the floor to the  
 south of the altar is to Thomas       
 Awmarle 1356-1401.It is the oldest    
{brass}in Cornwall and unusual as it   
 shows a priest with a sword.All the   
 windows have been replaced since World
 War 11 when they were damaged by a    
 stray bomb.The east end window is by  
 Webb.It shows Christ in Glory with    
 others dressed in costumes from around
 the world.The kings letter of thanks  
 is above the north door.It was sent by
{Charles 1 in 1643}to thank the parish 
 for its support in the Civil War.
