		<title>16FARMING IN GRIMLEY</title>
		<content>    There are twelve farms in Grimley. 
 The farms with most land are Church   
 Farm and Noken Farm. The latter is a  
 dairy farm with about a hundred milk- 
 ing cows and a hundred heifers and    
 calves. Church Farm has a sizeable ar-
 ea of land under crops. Moorcroft Farm
 has a herd of 30 cattle for beef. Mr. 
 Knight, the farmer, buys and sells his
 stock at Hereford and Kidderminster   
 markets. The breeds he keeps are      
 Simmenthal x Friesian and pure Simmen-
 thal. He has only one part-time farm- 
 worker. Sinton Farm is a small dairy  
 farm with 22 cows. Oakhall Farm is a- 
 gain small with 20 cows and 40 sheep. 
 Some market gardening is carried on.  
   Most farms have stock and much land 
 is rough pasture or left to grow to be
 cut for hay and silage. Generally the 
 farms are small and are a family con- 
 cern with little outside help.        </content>
