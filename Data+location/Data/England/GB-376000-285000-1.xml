		<content> This is an area of gently rolling     
 countryside consisting of many small  
 fields interspread with deciduos      
 coppices and impenetrable dingles     
 through which run small tributaries of
 the Severn. Through the western edge  
 of the block runs the Bridgnorth -    
 Kidderminster road, and the Bridgnorth
 - Stourbridge road cuts through the   
 extreme north-east corner. The        
 remainder of the land is criss-crossed
 by lanes, bridleways and footpaths.   
 There is mixed farming - sheep        
 rearing, cattle fattening, cereal     
 growing and root crops, especially    
 sugar-beet which is processed at      
 Kidderminster. High in the centre of  
 the block in private parkland is the  
 manor house, Coton Hall. There are    
 scattered farmhouses and cottages, but
 the majority of the population is     
 concentrated in the south-west corner </content>
