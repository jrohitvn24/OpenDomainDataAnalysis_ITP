		<content>This page is based on an interview with
a local farmer living at a farm called 
Silsworth Lodge.The farmer runs two    
farms, both of which are about 300     
years old. There are 310 acres         
altogether. The farmer owns all the    
land. On this land he has got some     
breeding ewes, two horses, some        
bantams and cows.He has got lots of    
machinery, four tractors and a combine 
harvester.The crops that are grown are 
winter wheat, winter barley, winter    
oats, and oil seed rape plus grass.    
The farm supplies milling grain for    
human consuption, lamb and beef,plus   
some eggs for the house.The crops are  
dried and cleaned if necessary when    
they are harvested. They are then sold 
to the open market. The straw is       
usually burned.
