		<title>19THE WARMINSTER CIVIC TRUST</title>
		<content> Founded in 1972 by architect Peter    
 Wakefield after a successful street   
 improvement scheme, Warminster Civic  
 Trust has about 200 members in 1985.  
 They are local people interested in   
 improving the town environment,       
 especially in the centre where most of
 the historic buildings are, and which 
 has become a Conservation Area.       
                                       
 The Trust's work is entirely done by  
 volunteers. Recent Trust activities   
 include a Warminster Common landscape 
 plan which won a special commendation,
 and an investigation into street      
 litter which showed most was dropped  
 on the routes to schools!             
                                       
 Executive Committee member Mr John    
 Cole says that the most important     
 issue for the Trust in 1985 is the new
 by-pass and its effects on the town.  </content>
