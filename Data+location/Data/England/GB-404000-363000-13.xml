		<title>13Army on the Moor - Heathylee</title>
		<content>                                       
     The army is a nuisance.  They chop
trees down which means it is dangerous 
to jump our horses and ponies when we  
take them up there for their exercise. 
There is a nice view and there used to 
be some jumps but they used them as    
firewood.                              
     They fire guns all night and they 
let flares off most of the night so    
the army are a real nuisance.          
     They leave dangerous objects like 
trip wires and old canes lying around  
in the heather.  Some of them leave    
canisters and they leave useful things 
as well. We found a range finder, a    
full tin of shaving foam and once we   
even found a tent.  We are always      
finding bits of camouflage.  Once we   
found a full belt of live bullets so   
we gave them back to the army.  They   
lie all over everywhere.               </content>
