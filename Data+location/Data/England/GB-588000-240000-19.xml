		<content>Sport of one kind or another is well   
catered for in Cornard. The Sports     
Centre caters for many indoor games    
such as badminton, netball and basket  
ball, as well as having an outdoor     
swimming pool. The main outdoor sports 
are football in the winter and cricket 
in the summer. Youth football teams are
Spartans and Dynamoes and there are    
several adult teams - United, Ramblers,
etc. Many girls and some boys from the 
age of five upwards are involved in    
majorettes. They spend many hours      
practising their music and marching and
have done well in some nationally      
organised competitions. They are often 
to be seen at local events in the      
summer. Angling is a popular sport for 
young and old. The Stour has some fine 
fishing. Pubs are well patronised,     
most homes have television and         
many now have video and computers.     </content>
