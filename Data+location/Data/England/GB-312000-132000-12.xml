		<title>12THE STRONG'S FARM</title>
		<content> The Strong's Farm is at Richs Holford.
 At the Strong's Farm they have beef   
 cattle and some sheep and they grow   
 oats,wheat and barley.                
 We saw the sheep dip. The disinfectant
 in the sheep dip will burn you if you 
 touch it.                             
 Mr Strong let us go in his combine    
 harvester.  To go inside the combine  
 you need to go up some steps . Inside 
 the cabin you can see a lot of things.
 We also went on top of the combine it 
 felt a little shakey.The combine has  
 cutters that cut wheat. The wheat     
 comes out of a funnel. Also on the    
 combine there are things that look    
 like cutters but they pick up the     
 straw left from the wheat instead.    
 They have big tanks for keeping wheat 
 they are 6 metres tall.  The different
 kinds of tractor are Fiat,Ford, Massey
 Furgeson,and Zetor.                   </content>
