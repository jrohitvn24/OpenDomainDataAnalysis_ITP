		<title>09LIVING IN DENBY</title>
		<content> Denby is a clean, nice, quiet village 
 in the west of our region. It is a    
 very friendly village and it is safe  
 for children to play. It has          
 disadvantages though, they are that   
 there are only three buses a day and  
 if you do not drive it could be very  
 isolated. The houses are very old as  
 they were built years ago and are     
 mostly farmhouses. Denby has changed  
 quite alot. The houses used to have   
 thatched roofs and they used to be old
 fashioned, but it has altered now. (It
 is stil nice and has good schools).   
 The people prefered it as it was.     
 Their main complaint is the shopping  
 facilities which  need improving.     
 Some of the land is woodland and      
 vegetation and there is also a large  
 area of derelict land.
