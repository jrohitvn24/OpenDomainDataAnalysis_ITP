		<title>10OUTSIDE GOLHANGER SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Goldhanger school stands in Church    
 Street.The shape of the school is a   
 cross.The windows in the school are   
 very high so the children would not   
 look out and ignore the teachers.The  
 school is a church school just like   
 our school.The bricks scho9l is built 
 of are very old and soft,so birds     
 peck holes in them.The school's       
 roof is slated,but on one side are    
 new tiles because the old slates were 
 dangerous.In the playground there is a
 hole where a Elm tree once stood and  
 the ground keeps subsiding where the  
 roots were burnt out.When the school  
 had games they went to the rectory    
 garden,as there was no playing field. 
 The school has a carved sign across   
 the roof saying"Goldhanger School     
 1874".The gates at the school are very
 dangerous as you can catch your       
 fingers.                              </content>
