		<content>    In 1985 farming practices are often
 changing .The hedgerows in our country
 side are freqently sacrificed to make 
 it easier for farmers to move about   
 their land with large machinery .So we
 have noted down the hedgerows and     
 wildlife that we could see.           
       The road to Ozleworth was       
 bordered by hedgerows in which we saw 
 the following plantlife:              
 Deadly Nightshade        Daisy        
 Hedge Woundwort          Poppy        
 Blackberry                            
    The insects that we saw included   
 Tortoise-shell and Red Admiral        
 butterflies. The hedgerow also        
 provided shelter and food for such    
 birds as Sparrows,Starlings and       
 Pigeons,and small animals such as mice
 and voles.                            
                                       
                                       </content>
