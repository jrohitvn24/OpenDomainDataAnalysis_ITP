		<title>04CLUNBURY HILL</title>
		<content>{  Clunbury hill}is 300 metres above   
 sea level, and it is 1800 metres long.
 Clunbury hill is rough grazing land.  
 The farmer who owns most of the hill  
 has cultivated some of it because it  
 is rough. He has ploughed it down.    
 Clunbury hill has a fairy stone; we do
 not know how long it has been there   
 but it is shown on old maps.          
   Some historians now believe that the
 last battle between{Caradoc}and the   
{Romans}was on Clunbury hill. There are
 many disused quarries. Some of the    
 houses in Clunbury are made from stone
 from the hill. There is a flat run    
 across the top of the hill called the 
 Gallop because horses race across it. 
 There is a great view from the hill.  
 From the top you can see the town of  
{Church Stretton}which is approximately
 15 miles away. There are several      
 natural springs on the hill.          </content>
