		<content> The Village Hall is the only hall     
 large enough to house badminton,carpet
 bowls,short and table tennis.It is    
 also the venue for a self-supporting  
 playgroup,taking an average of 20     
 children a morning aged 3 to 5,and a  
 fortnightly baby clinic.The hall can  
 also be hired out for birthday        
 parties; by the Parish Council for    
 drama productions (well supported for 
 children's plays but not so for adult 
 shows);by the youth club,and other    
 organisations. Competition as a venue 
 has come from a residential home for  
 male psychiatrics, Cedar Grange, who  
 offer a warm dining room for meetings 
 free of charge;the over_60's Tuesday  
 Club has taken advantage, as has the  
 Wine and Beer Circle.
