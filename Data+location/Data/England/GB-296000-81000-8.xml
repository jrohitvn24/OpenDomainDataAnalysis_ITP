		<content> In Starcross there stands the last    
 remaining pumping house which was used
 to power an{Atmospheric Railway}which 
 ran from Exeter to Newton Abbot.{     
{Isambard Kingdom Brunel}recommended   
 this system to S.Devon railway        
 company.It was a system which was     
 driven by a vacuum.A continuous iron  
 pipe was laid between the rails.The   
 pumping houses pumped air out of the  
 pipe,which had a slot in it covered by
 a leather flap.The flap was hinged on 
 one side but would lift on the other. 
 Underneath the front carriage a rod   
 carried the piston inside the pipe.   
 There were two wheels in the front    
 which raised the flap.The vacuum ahead
 of the piston enabled atmospheric     
 pressure behind to push it,and the    
 train,forward.A small wheel behind the
 piston pressed down the flap and      
 sealed it.{Open daily from 10am-6pm.  </content>
