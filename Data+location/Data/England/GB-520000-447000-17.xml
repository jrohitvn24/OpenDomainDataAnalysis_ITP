		<title>17TRAVELLING IN HORNSEA</title>
		<content> We sent a questionnaire out to all the
 families of the children in the 5th   
 year of Hornsea Primary School asking 
 about their methods of travel. We     
 found 82% of families sampled owned   
 motor cars. Of those who owned cars   
 73% used them to travel to work. The  
 majority worked in Hull. 60% used     
 their cars to go shopping but this was
 usually to shop locally in Hornsea.   
 Only 23% of families surveyed used the
 public bus service. We asked the      
 families if they thought Hornsea had a
 good bus service. Of all the replies  
 received 82% thought Hornsea had a    
 poor bus service. Suggested ways in   
 which it could be improved were:-     
                                       
 More buses   50%  Faster buses   10%  
 Mini-buses   17%  Cheaper fares  15%  
 Local service   8%
