		<title>14WOMERTON HILL FARM</title>
		<content>{Mr.Coleman}owns a{sheep farm}high up  
 on the Longmynd.His farm nestles in a 
 small valley,sheltered from the wind  
 and storms.It is{colder}high up on the
 Longmynd than it is in Shrewsbury.The 
 snow stays on the ground longer,and   
 quite often he is cut off from other  
 people.He can't grow any crops except 
 grass because the soil is too thin.The
 rain washes the soil down the hill to 
 the lucky farmers at the bottom.      
 Mr.Coleman likes living where         
 he does. He enjoys the{peace}of the   
 countryside, and he loves his animals.
 He has made a beautiful garden which  
 is protected from the weather by the  
 farm buildings and the hills around   
 the farm.
