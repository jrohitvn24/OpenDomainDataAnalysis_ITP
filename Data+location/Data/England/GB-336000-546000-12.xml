		<title>12A SCHOOLS' CRICKET MATCH</title>
		<content>   Limehouse School regularly hosts    
 cricket matches against other schools 
 in this area. There are three         
 different age groups: under-15s,      
 under-14s, and under-13s.             
   Caldew School from Dalston plays    
 annually against Limehouse            
 School. They travel in a small 12     
 seater mini-bus to Limehouse School.It
 takes about ten minutes to reach the  
 school.                               
   In the 1985 game each team played   
 twenty overs. Limehouse won the toss  
 of the coin and put Caldew into bat   
 first. Caldew's innings owed much to  
 an unbeaten partnership of 75 runs.   
 Caldew's final score after twenty     
 overs was 103 for 4. Limehouse's final
 score was 39 all out.                 
   It was an enjoyable game for both   
 teams and there were no hard feelings 
 at the end.                           </content>
