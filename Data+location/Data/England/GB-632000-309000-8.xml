		<content>   Children who are over 11 and live in
 Blofield and Blofield Heath go to     
 secondary school at Thorpe St Andrews,
 on the edge of Norwich about 5 miles  
 away.  This a large comprehensive     
 school of about 1300 pupils.          
   The pupils are picked up each       
 morning by several coaches and brought
 back in the same way in the evening.  
 If you want to stay late at school for
 a music or sports practice there is a 
 late bus.                             
   Sometimes in the winter, when there 
 is heavy snow, the buses are unable to
 get through to pick up the pupils and 
 in the winter of l985 the school had  
 to close early on several days, as the
 snow was falling and it wasn't certain
 that the pupils could get home if they
 stayed longer.
