		<title>14LOCAL HISTORY:      QUINTON</title>
		<content>   Once the{centre of village craft}and
 life, Friday Street lies right next to
 the{church of St.Swithin, Quinton.    
   The street takes its name from St.  
 Frideswide, English abbess and patron 
 saint of Oxford.{Magdalen College,    
 Oxford, owns many properties in the   
 village, and built a clubroom for     
 villagers in Friday Street in         
 1890.This is now a hairdresser's as is
 the old village general stores and    
 post office, also in this street.     
  Friday Street contains 4 examples of 
 timber frame thatched cottages with   
 wattle and daub infill.               
   One of these has the macabre history
 of being the home of the last         
 suspected victim of a witchcraft      
 murder ( Meon Hill, 1945)             
   No.25 built with roof beams of green
 timber,cut locally,was once threatened
 and is now a class 2 listed building. </content>
