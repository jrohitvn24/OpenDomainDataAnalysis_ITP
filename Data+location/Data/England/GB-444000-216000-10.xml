		<title>10THE EX-MAYOR OF WOODSTOCK.</title>
		<content>  We went to interview the ex-mayor of 
Woodstock Mr Wilmot. He enjoyed being  
mayor very much, to him it was a "great
experience." Mr Wilmot was a very busy 
man because he had to go to meetings,  
parties and outings. Mr Wilmot went to 
visit a lot of people who he would not 
normally meet. He did not get any pay  
for being mayor. He only wore his chain
of office on special occasions. The    
chain is made of nine carat gold.He    
also had a mace which his mace bearer  
carried. He had been on the Council for
so many years that the Council thought 
he was ready to be mayor.              
  The Council meets in the Town Hall   
which was built in 1766. The Town Hall 
is used for fetes and bazaars. The     
Woodstock archives are kept in the Town
Hall. The library is just about to     
leave the Town Hall for new premises.
