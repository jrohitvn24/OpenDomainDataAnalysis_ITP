		<content>                                       
ON SATURDAY ALL OUR FAMILY WENT FOR A  
WALK. IN MY FAMILY THERE IS MY FATHER, 
MOTHER, BROTHER AND MYSELF. WE ALSO    
TOOK OUR DOG.                          
WE FIRST WALKED THROUGH THE HOUSING    
ESTATE PASSED THE SCHOOL AND DOWN ONTO 
A LANE WHICH TAKES YOU TO THE RIVER    
CHURNET.THE PATH IS A VERY OLD ONE     
WHICH WAS PROBABLY USED BY THE MONKS   
WHICH LIVED IN THE ABBEY WHICH WAS     
BUILT BY THE SIDE OF THE RIVER. THE    
ABBEY WAS PULLED DOWN YEARS AGO AND    
THERE ARE ONLY ONE OR TWO STONES LEFT  
TO SEE,                                
WHILE WE WALKED MY DAD TOLD US THE     
NAMES OF THE FLOWERS AND THE BIRDS WE  
SAW. SOME OF THE FLOWERS HAD VERY FUNNY
NAMES WHICH MY DAD SAID PEOPLE HAD     
GIVEN TO THEM YEARS AGO. I ENJOY GOING 
FOR WALKS AND I AM TRYING TO REMEMBER  
ALL THE NAMES SO I CAN TELL MY CHILDREN</content>
