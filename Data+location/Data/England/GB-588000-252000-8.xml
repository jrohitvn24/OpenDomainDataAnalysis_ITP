		<content>Children travel to our school in four  
ways;by bus,by car,by bicycle or on    
foot.The Suffolk Education Authority   
provides a mini-bus to transport       
children from Thorpe Morieux.Some who  
live less than two miles from the      
school are allowed to travel on this   
bus if they are on the route and pay a 
fee.15 children are using the bus this 
term.5 children cycle regularly,9      
children walk and 34 children are      
brought to school in cars, usually     
driven by mothers.To help children     
to cycle properly,the school runs      
Cycling Proficiency Courses each year. 
5th Year children are able to take an  
examination,conducted by a policeman,  
and if they pass they are presented    
with a Certificate.We make visits to   
places of interest from our school and 
in recent years we have been to Norwich
Castle Hedingham,Whipsnade and Easton. </content>
