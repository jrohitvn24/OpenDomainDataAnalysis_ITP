		<title>11THE RED LION AT HUNNINGHAM</title>
		<content>   We went to visit the{" Red Lion"}in 
{Hunningham}. The owner,{Mr Spicer}has 
 been there since April of this year   
 ({1985}). {Mr Spicer}has been an      
 innkeeper for{21}years. We asked him  
 if he enjoyed the life of being an    
 innkeeper and his answer was "{YES}". 
 The '{Red Lion}' has been standing    
 since the 16th century . The {Red Lion
 has many attractions , for example the
{River and Bridge}with an amazing  view
 of the {Red Lion }from it.We asked {Mr
{Spicer}if he had a timetable of a     
 typical day. His answer to that was{  
{ NO}. The pub is opened at eleven   o 
 'clock in the morning until two thirty
 in the afternoon. Then it is opened at
 six at night until eleven  o 'clock at
 night. There have been some changes in
 the way of trade because shops are now
 allowed to sell wines and spirits and 
 people can buy them to drink at home. </content>
