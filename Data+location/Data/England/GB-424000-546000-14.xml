		<content>      The fastest time recorded for    
 flying this race is under 10 hrs. ( an
 average speed of 52 mph ).            
      As all the birds in the races are
 released at one fixed point and have  
 different distances to fly to reach   
 their home 'loft' their speed is      
 calculated in feet/min. All loft      
 positions are measured on the National
 Grid System and recorded on computer  
 to within a tolerance of 1 yard. Thus 
 each bird's average speed can be      
 checked very accurately.              
      Racing pigeons are now bred      
 specially for sport and prices vary   
 enormously. Prize birds have been sold
 for as much as Â£10,000.               
      One of the largest races for the 
 North of England is the 'Vaux Gold    
 Cup' which starts at Oudenaarde in    
 Belgium, a distance of 270 miles and  
 involving 50,000 birds.               </content>
