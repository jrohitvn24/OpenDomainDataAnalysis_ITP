		<content> Crispin and I received a reply to the 
 letter we sent asking to look through 
 the files.Mrs Towler had said we could
 ,so at eleven o'clock Crispin and I   
 went to Tiptree Library.Mrs Towler    
 showed us the books and let us get on 
 and work.We read about Tiptree Priory.
 There were some maps that showed where
 the important places were.We found out
 that Tiptree Priory was dedicated to  
 the S.S.,which probably is why there  
 is a tunnel running underneath the    
 Priory.We also found   out that       
 Tiptree Heath was in the Domesday Book
 but it was called "Woodland for       
 Swine",because people used to put     
 their animals there so that they could
 eat.Tiptree Priory is the oldest      
 building in Tiptree at 415 years old.
