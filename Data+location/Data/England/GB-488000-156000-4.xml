		<title>04The Canal at Deepcut, 1985</title>
		<content>   To date about 40km of the           
{Basingstoke Canal}have been dredged.  
 For the first time in 30 years a boat 
 has passed through 9 of the 14 locks  
 forming the{Deepcut Flight.}The canal 
 is no longer used for trade purposes  
 but is purely for recreation. The aim 
 of the restoration, according to the  
 chairman of the Surrey and Hampshire  
 Canal Society, is "to give pleasure to
 many and to enhance the areas through 
 which it passes". Large development   
 areas proposed along the canal banks  
 have caused concern to the Canal      
 Society who feel that the amenity     
 value will be destroyed.              
   Residents have written to a local   
 newspaper giving their views on the   
 restoration work. They feel that the  
 work leaves a trail of destruction.   
 Many people feel that the canal should
 be kept as a place of peace and quiet.</content>
