		<content> Scarborough is a holiday tourist      
 centre. On South Bay tourists hire    
 deck chairs and wind breaks and try to
 get sun tanned while the little       
 children dig in the sand, ride the    
 donkeys and play in the ball pool or  
 on the trampolines. When people get   
 hungry they go to the fast food stalls
 on the foreshore. Here they can buy   
 toffee apples, hot dogs, hamburgers,  
 waffles, candyfloss, ice cream, pots  
 of tea, fish and chips, pizzas and    
 rock. There are lots of amusement     
 arcades with video games and slot     
 machines in an atmosphere of loud     
 music and neon light. By the Harbour  
 there is a fun fair with dodgems and a
 viking swing boat. When you are tired 
 of all this, you can buy souvenirs of 
 Scarborough from one of the many gift 
 shops, before you set off home by car,
 train or coach.                       </content>
