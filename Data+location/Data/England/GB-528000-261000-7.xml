		<title>07Housing in Papworth</title>
		<content> Papworth has 489 units of housing     
 belonging to the Papworth Village     
 Settlement and 6 units of private     
 housing. The former are for use by the
 Trust which in 1975 became a Housing  
 Association.                          
                                       
 The houses vary from small bed-sitters
 to large detached houses. The         
 intention is for handicapped people to
 be able to lead as normal a life as   
 possible with their families.         
                                       
 There are plans for more flats        
 specially adapted for the handicapped.
