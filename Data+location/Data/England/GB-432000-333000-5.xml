		<title>05SHOPPING FOR FOOD</title>
		<content>   At a{supermarket,}away from the city
 centre, but in a built up area, the   
 manager was interviewed by a group of 
 children.  There are more women staff 
 than men, some work part_time and     
 generally there would be about twenty 
 on the shop floor and ten behind the  
 scenes.  The manager decides what has 
 to be ordered but Head office decides 
 on the prices, not necessarily the    
 same as in the other supermarkets in  
 the same chain.  There are daily      
 deliveries to the shop which has its  
 own named brands as well as many other
 popular brands.  Some customers were  
 questioned as they entered the shop.  
 Most of them lived close by and bought
 mainly English food. Other children   
 went to a small shop in the same area,
 run solely by an Asian family.  AS    
 well as English food the owner keeps a
 large stock of Asian food.            </content>
