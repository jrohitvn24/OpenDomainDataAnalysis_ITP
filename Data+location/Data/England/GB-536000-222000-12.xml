		<content> the house of their tutor who lives in 
 same road as us.Its very convenient   
 _most of the chrildrens other         
 extra-curriculcer actiuities take     
 place at least ten miles outside the  
 village  in one or the other nearby   
 towns.Between them, the children      
 belong  to two swimming clubs, the    
 local cub pack ,and go to judo ,      
 trampoline and music and dance        
 classes.They also have a swimming     
 lesson on Saturday mornings ,so most  
 of the week is taken up ferrying one  
 or other  of them about in my ten year
 Ford Cortina car.It was a heap of rust
 a few weeks ago,but having just had it
 re-sprayed I am now quite proud of its
 new gleaming gold coat.               
                                       
 The children go to school at 8.45 am  
 via the crossing lady who stands      
 just outside our house.{              </content>
