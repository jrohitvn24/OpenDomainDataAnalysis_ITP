		<title>12Coddenham/Hemingstone People</title>
		<content> Coddenham village clusters round the  
 two main streets with a population of 
 about 500 while Hemingstone is a      
 sprawling community of about 150. Both
 villages have far fewer related       
 families than in the past and many    
 newcomers, the great majority of whom 
 travel to various occupations outside 
 the area. Most houses are owner-      
 occupied and well maintained. Young   
 people mostly move away as house      
 prices are fairly high and there are  
 few to rent except for several holiday
 cottages. Originally the old Rectory  
 at Coddenham and Hemingstone Hall were
 a source of employment for local      
 people such as housemaids, coachmen,  
 gardeners etc. Farmers employed a     
 dozen or more men on the land but now 
 can manage with just one or two       
 members of the family. Retired people 
 enjoy this attractive area.           </content>
