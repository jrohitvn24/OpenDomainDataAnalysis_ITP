		<content> The Humber Bridge acted as a catalyst 
 to the development of this area. The  
 motorway network reached to Barnetby  
 Top in 1977,this was linked to Barton 
 by the dual carriageway, A15 in 1978. 
 The Bridge opened in June 1981, that  
 summer saw the commencement of const  
 ruction of the Â£ 16 million 7.75 mile 
 link road to Immingham. The construc- 
 tion work, using a new cement process 
 went well, and was opened 9 mts early 
 in march 1983. Later that same year,  
 the dual carriageway of the A180 (T)  
 was completed to Grimsby. The opening 
 of the A180,linking the HumberBank Ind
 ustries and Grimsby with the motorway 
 network has had an immense effect; the
 heavy traffic and frequent accidents  
 on the old  A18 became a thing of the 
 past.The excellent roads have been a  
 major selling point of the Elsham Wold
 Industrial Estate.                    </content>
