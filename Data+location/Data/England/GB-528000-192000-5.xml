		<content> In the morning {Southgate}is a busy   
 place with commuters coming to the    
 Underground Station to catch trains or
 buses to take them to work.   Other   
 people travel by car motor-bike or    
 bicycle and{Southgate}can become      
 conjested causing traffic jams.       
 There are many schools around {       
{Southgate}and in the morning the      
 school children, wearing school       
 uniform and carrying bags with their  
 books, sports kit and perhaps musical 
 instruments, are off to school.  Also 
 delivery vans can be seen taking      
 supplies to the shops.  Often security
 guards are seen taking money to banks 
 or people queueing at the cash        
 dispensers outside.  After the early  
 morning rush, {Southgate}quietens     
 down, with housewives and senior      
 citizens doing their shopping.  There 
 is less traffic about for a while.    </content>
