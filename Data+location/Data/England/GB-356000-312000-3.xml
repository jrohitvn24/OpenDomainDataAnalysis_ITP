		<title>03ST.GEORGE'S CHURCH,RODINGTON</title>
		<content> RODINGTON IS ONLY A SMALL PARISH BUT  
 IT HAS A CHURCH, AND HAS HAD ONE SINCE
 BEFORE THE ORIGINAL DOMESDAY BOOK. AS 
 IT STANDS NOW IT IS BUILT OF STONE AND
 BRICK. THE ROOF IS TILED.  THERE ARE  
 ELEVEN WINDOWS.  THEY ARE ALL ARCHED. 
 THE GLASS IS HELD IN PLACE BY LEAD    
 STRIPS IN A DIAMOND PATTERN.  FOUR    
 OF THE WINDOWS HAVE PICTURES IN THEM. 
 THE  BIG WINDOWS HAVE THREE LITTLE    
 CIRCLES AT THE TOP IN A FLOWER SHAPE. 
 THERE IS A WOODEN STEEPLE WITH TWO    
 BELLS IN.  ON TOP OF THIS THERE IS A  
 WEATHER VANE.  IT USED TO BE A        
 COCKEREL BUT NOW IT IS AN ARROW.  IT  
 WAS MADE BY A BLACKSMITH AT THE NEAR  
 BY VILLAGE OF LONGDON.  STUART'S      
 GRANDAD HELD THE LADDER AND ENCOURAGED
 THE BLACKSMITH WHEN HE TOOK IT UP     
 BECAUSE IT WAS VERY HIGH. A GATE      
 ERECTED TO CELEBRATE GEORGE V'S       
 JUBILEE IN 1935 STILL STANDS.         </content>
