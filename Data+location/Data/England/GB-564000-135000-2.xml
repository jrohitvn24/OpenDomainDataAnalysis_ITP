       The{A21}is the main road between
 London and Hastings so a lot of       
 traffic passes through{Lamberhurst.   
 The A21 seems always to be in need of 
 repairs which cause a lot of          
 congestion. At the beginning and end  
 of school we have to have a lollipop  
 lady to help us cross the road safely.
 Sometimes it is difficult to          
 concentrate on our work because the   
 heavy lorries thunder as they pass,   
 shaking the school.                   
  {The village centre}has seven shops. 
 Some of the houses are very old but   
 modern developments have been added.  
 There are also five public houses,    
 which serve travellers on the main    
 road as well as the locals. There is a
 triangular shaped piece of grass where
 the{High Street}meets the A21. There  
 are usually lots of parked cars.      </content>
