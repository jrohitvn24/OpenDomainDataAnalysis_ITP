		<title>08Local Concerns In Painswick</title>
		<content> The people in Painswick and district  
 are very concerned for the environment
 and many oppose schemes which could   
 spoil the lovely countryside or damage
 wildlife.These include local planning 
 and the killing of badgers.           
  People are also very concerned about 
 the amount of traffic going through   
 Painswick.We counted 32 cars, 6 vans, 
 6 lorries and 6 coaches in 5 minutes. 
  Farming methods are also causing a   
 great deal of concern in the          
 block.Hedge removal to make fields    
 bigger is taking away many sorts of   
 natural habitat for wildlife.Crop _   
 spraying is also thought to be        
 damaging wildlife.                    
  Painswick is famous for its carefully
 marked and well looked after footpaths
 which give easy access to the country_
 side.Great care is taken to keep the  
 village clean and tidy.               </content>
