		<title>01STANHOE AND ITS AREA</title>
		<content> This is an intensively farmed area    
 lying between 40m and 70m O.D.  It is 
 served by relatively few metalled     
 roads but has a number of unmade green
 lanes which were formerly of          
 importance but are now used for farm  
 traffic and walkers.  Hedges divide   
 the large fields most of which are    
 devoted to arable farming though some 
 stock is present too.  It is still    
 very much a community though perhaps  
 not so strongly as in the past.  Apart
 from four cottages and a farm in the  
 hamlet of Shammar, all the houses lie 
 within the parish of Stanhoe and with 
 two exceptions are in the cluster of  
 houses which make up this small       
 village.  Stanhoe supports a church,  
 Chapel, Post Office, Public House and 
 Village Hall but within the last ten  
 years lost its school and second shop.
