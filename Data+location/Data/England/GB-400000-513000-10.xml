		<title>10Disused Quarries</title>
		<content>  The closure of the Barnard Castle to 
 Kirkby Stephen railway in{1964}led    
 to the closure of all but one of the  
 remaining quarries.Most of the unused 
 land became grassed over and,although 
 it was rough and uneven,it was in many
 instances used by the farmers as extra
 grazing for sheep and fatstock.       
  Whilst the construction of the dual  
 carriageway on the A66 trunk road was 
 to require much imported material,it  
 also demanded convenient places to act
 as dumps for countless tons of earth, 
 especially from the section at Galley 
 Hill where the former steep gradient  
 was to be drastically reduced.        
  The small disused quarries provided  
 the ideal solution to the problem.Tons
 of rock,clay and earth were tipped in 
 them.When topsoil and grass seed were 
 then added new agricultural land was  
 created and the environment improved. </content>
