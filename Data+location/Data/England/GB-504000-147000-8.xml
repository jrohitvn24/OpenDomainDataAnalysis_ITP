		<title>08LORDS OF THE MANOR</title>
		<content>  1985 is the 500th anniversary of the 
 founding of the Bray family dynasty at
 Shere. At the Battle of Bosworth,     
 Reginald Bray was a supporter of Henry
 Tudor, and after the battle it was    
 Reginald who found the crown in the   
 thornbush; he was subsequently        
 rewarded with,amongst other things,   
 the manor of Shere. He was also made a
 Knight of the Garter,and was          
 responsible for the completion of the 
 nave of St.George's Chapel,Windsor,   
 where the Bray crest,the hemp-bray,can
 be found 175 times within the nave.   
 The Bray's have been Lords of the     
 Manor of Shere for the past 500years  
 without a break; Mrs.Handa Bray is the
 15th Lord of the Manor.(It is a       
 condition of the inheritance that the 
 Lord of the Manor 'bears the name and 
 arms of Bray.)The Bray estate covers  
 2,000acres in the surrounding area.   </content>
