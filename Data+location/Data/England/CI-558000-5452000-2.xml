		<content> Granite is one of the most important  
 and durable of building materials in  
 Jersey . It plays an important part in
 conserving the character of the       
 island's buildings. This quarry is    
 sited at the head of St Peter's Valley
 They quarry hard pink granite which is
 used for lots of things i.e ,blocks,  
 slabs,gravel,chippings and hardcore.  
 The company also produces ready mixed 
 concrete .Gravel is exported to       
 Guernsey,but nowhere else. Most of the
 granite is used in Jersey. The granite
 is blasted out with explosives which  
 are planted in the cliffs. It is then 
 crushed mixed with cement and moulded 
 into blocks or slabs.{Granite Products
 employ 43 people.The quarry is        
 25 years old and is likely to last a  
 few more years.
