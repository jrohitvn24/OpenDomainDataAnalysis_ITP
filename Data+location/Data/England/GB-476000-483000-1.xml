{   Pickering}is a small town, with a  
 population of about 5500 people. It is
 a{market town}with a market every     
 Monday. The people of Pickering are   
 friendly and it is easy to go for     
 walks in the countryside. it is a     
{quiet}town most of the time, but on   
 Saturdays  and Sundays a lot of people
 come on the trains from Grosmont,     
 Goathland and Levisham to see         
 Pickering.Other people come to town to
 catch the trains and to go up to the  
 moors. Visitors to Pickering like to  
 look at the church, which is quite big
 and look at the paintings on the      
 walls.There is a church choir. There  
 is a castle, which is quite old. There
 is also a swimming pool and football  
 pitch, which is used by lots of people
 in the town. I think the town would be
 better if we had a professional team. </content>
