		<title>11Concord Sports Centre Sheff.</title>
		<content>   Concord Sports Centre was built 10  
 years ago and last week we went to    
 have a look round.  The guide said    
 that there were more than 20 different
 sports you could play there.  First we
 saw the table tennis room.  Two people
 were playing.  Next we looked at the  
 trampolines and at the men practising 
 weight lifting.  We went down some    
 steps and there we were in the lower  
 hall where they do judo, karate and   
 hockey.  In the main hall up above we 
 saw people playing short tennis with a
 plastic racket and a foam rubber ball.
  Outside you could play golf, football
 or go orienteering.  The swimming pool
 was empty because it was being        
 repaired, but it will be finished by  
 the 6 weeks holiday.  I think we are  
 very lucky to live near Concord Sports
 Centre.
