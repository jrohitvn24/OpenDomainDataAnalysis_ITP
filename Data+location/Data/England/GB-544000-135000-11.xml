		<content>   I (Paul) walked up Hartfield High   
 Street.There are two pubs,The Anchor  
 and The Hay Waggon.They both have good
 restaurants which attract people from 
 miles around. There is a primary      
 school with 100 children. There are 3 
 shops;Pooh Corner,selling gifts to do 
 with the A.A.Milne stories,a general  
 store and newsagents and a antique    
 shop. There is also a post-office.    
   In the centre is a water pump which 
 still works.A road leads up to the    
 church and doctor's house.            
   There is a playing field called The 
 Town Croft where they play            
 football,cricket,stool ball and       
 tennis. A childrens playground is also
 there.                                
   There is a old railway station which
 is now used as a play school.The line 
 has been turned into a country park.  
  We also have a war memorial.         </content>
