		<title>13MUMS SHOPPING</title>
		<content> Mum travels 5 miles 3 times a week by 
 car to shop in Macclesfield. Saturday 
 and Tuesday are to get odds and ends  
 but Thursday is the big shopping day. 
 First we have to wait about 15 minutes
 for a parking space then we pay 15p   
 for a parking ticket.In the           
 supermarket we get our trolley and go 
 round the store collecting our        
 groceries. We buy low fat milk and    
 cheese for my brother. When we have   
 got everything we pay at the check out
 and then pack all the shopping in our 
 car. Then we go into the sports shop  
 to get special weight lifting gloves  
 and then to the news agents to get a  
 Hells Angels magazine for my brother. 
 On our way home we have to buy some   
 petrol at the garage we call at the   
 village shop for the television papers
 and stamps.                           
                                       </content>
