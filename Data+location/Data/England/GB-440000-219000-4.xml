		<title>04Wootton Flower Show</title>
		<content>This event first began in September    
1877 and is probably the oldest        
organisation in the village. No shows  
were held  during the six years of the 
two world wars,and after the last war  
shows did not open until 1949. The show
is always held on the nearest Saturday 
to September 8.                        
The show,which is a popular old-time   
annual event,is always held in the     
grounds of the old rectory which is now
owned by Mrs Clutterbuck. Cups for     
special events were first presented    
after the second world war.            
Today it is an occasion which all      
villagers old and young alike          
attend.There are alot of interesting   
categories for children to enter.
