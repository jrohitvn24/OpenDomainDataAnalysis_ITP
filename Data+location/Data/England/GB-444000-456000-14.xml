		<title>14A DAY IN DONNA'S LIFE</title>
		<content> On Sunday I got up at 9 o'clock. I had
 a bowl of Rice _ Krispies and then    
 I got dressed and then I did a bit of 
 gardening. Then I helped dad to wash  
 the car. Then we all had dinner. When 
 the car dried  we went to Little Grans
 for tea. We saw Uncle and Auntie who  
 were just having tea. I saw their     
 rabbit. My Uncle and Auntie did have  
 two rabbits but one died when he was  
 away on holiday but the children did  
 not go so then they could look after  
 the rabbit and one died when they were
 looking after it so now there is only 
 one rabbit left. I went home and got  
 to bed at 9 o'clock.  I was very      
 tired. I went to sleep straight away .
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
