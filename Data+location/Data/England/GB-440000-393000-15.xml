 of sorts of plants including a        
 selection of bedding plants. The most 
 expensive of these is the standard    
 rose tree at Â£6.00 each. The bedding  
 plants start at 4p upwards.           
  The nursery itself covers an area of 
 approximate 4 acres and in that space 
 are glasshouses and three plastic     
 tunnels.                              
  There are 4 people working at the    
 nusery. It opens at dawn(7:00am)and   
 closes at dusk(9:00pm.                
  They use around 1 ton of fertiliser  
 per year and much more manure.        
  They also have 6 goats (for milk)    
 50-60 poultry birds (for eggs) 6 guard
 dogs, 1 cat and 3 kittens to keep out 
 rats and mice.
