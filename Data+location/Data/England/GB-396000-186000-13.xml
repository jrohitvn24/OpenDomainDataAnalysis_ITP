		<title>13GARSDON METHODIST CHAPEL</title>
		<content>    There is a Methodist Chapel in     
 Garsdon and three teachers organise a 
 Sunday School for about twelve        
 children each week. The chapel was    
 built in 1860. Sometimes they have    
 preachers in to take the services.    
 About a year ago, 1984, the           
 collections helped to pay for a new   
 roof. When the roof was being done,   
 the floor was also cleaned and        
 varnished.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
