 The disused  school at Churchtown has 
 been converted by the Girl Guide      
 Association into holiday accommodation
 for Guides and Brownies. A dormitory  
 sleeping 18 and a good kitchen has    
 been added to the building.           
 Brownie Packs come with their leaders 
 for a week of well-organised          
 instruction and fun.   Each day       
 includes sharing the chores, outdoor  
 activities, competitions and prayers. 
 The children learn to live together in
 a small community.   For many it is   
 the first time they have left their   
 families, and leaders need a sense of 
 humour, energy and tact.              
 Over 1000 Brownies visit the house    
 annually.   They pay Â£1.50 per night  
 plus cost of food and electricity.    
 A Guide committee administers the     
 scheme and springcleans the house.    </content>
