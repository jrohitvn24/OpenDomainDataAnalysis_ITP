		<title>06POLICING THE DISTRICT</title>
		<content>Our area is policed by several         
different police men/women.            
Cheddingtons village policeman is  P.C 
Buckle.He has to patrol Cheddington,   
Slapton,Ivinghoe and Ivinghoe Aston.   
Mostly P.C. Buckle deals with petty    
crimes,breakins,burglaries and         
vandalism.A policeman cant walk        
through all the villages so he has a   
Panda car.Inside his car there is a    
radio with which he can either         
contact Aylesbury police station or    
his H.Q at Kiddlinton.When he          
captures a criminal he has to take him 
directly to Aylesbury police station.  
The panda cars are not used on         
motorways as are traffic cars,(often   
called Jam Sandwiches)The main         
headquarters is in Kiddlinton where    
they have a helicopter used in         
emergencies.                           
                                       </content>
