		<content> EDUCATION There are no Schools within 
 the area. There was a village School  
 at High Offley but it was closed in   
 1980, and the School and School House 
 now stand empty. The local children   
 attend the First School in Woodseaves,
 the Middle School in Gnosall and Com  
 -prehensive High Schools in Stafford. 
 This demands early morning travel for 
 children of nine who have to travel   
 from Weston Jones to Gnosall. The     
 travellng usually puts two hours on   
 the School day.                       
 A few children attend private Schools 
 in Stafford, Stone or Brewood.        
 There are a number of University      
 students whose families live locally  
 and they attend Universities all over 
 the country.                          
 The very young children have a Play   
 Group which meets once a week in the  
 Village Hall.                         </content>
