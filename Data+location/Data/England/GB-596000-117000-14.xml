		<content> There is only one way to get to       
 Camber and that is by road, and there 
 is only one road, the C24, which goes 
 through the village from Rye to Lydd. 
 During the summer buses run every     
 hour,in the winter every two hours,   
 with no buses on Sunday, The fare to  
 Rye is 75p single and Â£1,00 return. In
 the summer coach firms bring holiday  
 makers to the camps, and also arrange 
 trips to the continent and to places  
 of interest in the area. Many of the  
 residents have private cars, and the  
 majority of the people who visit      
 Camber come by car, which cause       
 considerable snarl-ups at peak times, 
 when the car parks and every available
 place in the village is full, the road
 on the return journey home is         
 chock-a-block for miles.
