		<title>16A Survey of Scartho. Part 2.</title>
		<content> especially in the parts not           
 deliberately developed as{estates.    
 The impression is of a nice place to  
 live.                                 
{Shopping.                             
         There are a small number of   
 shops dotted around in the nearby     
 village of{Scartho,}which sell a wide 
 variety of goods. This makes in       
 unnecessary to go to town for regular 
 provisions, but there is a good       
 regular bus service to central        
{Grimsby,}serving most of the estate.  
 Many of the other small shops around  
 the estate seem to survive competition
 with the village and{Grimsby,}if they 
 provide the necessary{local services  
 like,{fish and chips}and{newspapers.
