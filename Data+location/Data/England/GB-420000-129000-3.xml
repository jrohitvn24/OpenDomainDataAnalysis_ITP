 stops, you get "punished".Some of the 
 punishments are pinching, squashing,  
 kicking and tickle.                   
 To play queenie you use a small ball  
 which the person who is "up" has to   
 throw behind them. Someone catches it 
 and hides it behind their back. The   
 person who is "up" has to guess who   
 has it.                               
 To play polo you have two ends. The   
 person who is "up" is at one end and  
 the rest are at the other end. The    
 person who is "up" names a category   
 and the others have to think of a     
 thing in that category. The person who
 is "up" calls out something in that   
 category. If the one you chose is     
 said, you run from your end to the    
 other end and back again. The person  
 who is "up" also runs and the first   
 one back says "polo"and is the winner.</content>
