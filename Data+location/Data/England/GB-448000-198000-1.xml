		<content>    Our D Block is covered by a large  
area of farmland, one village and many 
residential areas.                     
    The village of Sunningwell is of   
historical and architectural interest  
and has a 13th century church.         
    The residential areas include many 
recent developments and R.A.F. Abingdon
housing estates.                       
    Several schools are in the area    
including Sunningwell Primary School,  
Dunmore Infant and Junior School,      
Rush Common Primary School,            
Fitzharrys  Secondary School and       
Abingdon College of Further Education. 
There is also  Radley College, a       
public school for boys, and the Manor  
Preparatory School. The Abingdon       
bypass goes through the area. It was   
opened in September l973 and has       
greatly eased traffic  congestion in   
the town.                              </content>
