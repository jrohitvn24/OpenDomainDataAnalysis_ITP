		<title>14Alfriston Church</title>
		<content> The parish church of St Andrew,       
 Alfriston stands next to the River    
 Cuckmere. It was built in 1360 in the 
 shape of a Greek Cross. Unlike many   
 churches there have been no major     
 additions to the original design. The 
 Church is built from local flints and 
 is considered a fine example of a     
 building in flint.                    
                                       
 Its size has gained it the reputation 
 of the Cathedral of the Downs.  It has
 a fine shingled brooch spire in the   
 centre of the church and lofty 14th   
 Century arches. Notable features      
 include a richly decorated sedilia and
 beautiful Easter Sepulchre.           
                                       
 The church has 6 bells which are rung 
 from the centre floor of the church,a 
 sight which is of great interest to   
 visitors.                             </content>
