		<content>  Many creatures live in Scarcliffe    
 Wood.Near the stream we saw a coot.A  
 coot is a black bird with a white     
 beak.You find them near water.They    
 make their nests there.Coots have     
 webbed feet.They use their feet like  
 paddles and they are good             
 swimmers.They dip their heads under   
 the water and catch fish.             
  We saw swallows.Swallows are superb  
 fliers.They obtain their insect food  
 in flight and nest in colonies.Some   
 nest in natural cavities or in burrows
 dug in the ground.                    
  Traces of foxes can be found in the  
 woods.They are reddish_brown in colour
 with sharp eyes and pointed           
 ears.Farmers and gamekeepers regard   
 them as pests.                        
  Many grey squirrels live in the      
 woods.They are small and move very    
 quickly.They damage trees.            </content>
