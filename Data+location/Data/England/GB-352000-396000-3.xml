		<content> Most firms are situated in the        
 industrial  estate on Haydock Lane    
 north of the{East Lancs Road (A580)}. 
 The first firm started there in 1950. 
 The estate has grown slowly since 1950
 and covers land which used to be      
 farmland and miners'cottages.There are
 only two firms with more than 100     
 employees, and the average is 28. The 
 firms import goods from New Zealand   
 and much of Europe, and goods are     
 distributed from Haydock all over     
 Britain, but particularly in northwest
 England. Many of the firms chose      
 Haydock as a base because it is close 
 to good trunk roads -the{A580}and{M62}
 to the east and west coast ports, and 
 close to the{M6}for north-south       
 travel. There are a few firms on      
 Clipsley Lane{(A599)}, the old main   
 road through Haydock.
