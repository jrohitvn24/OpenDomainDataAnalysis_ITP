		<title>08THE YOUNG SAVER IN PRUDHOE</title>
		<content> Most of Prudhoe's nine banks and      
 building societies have a special     
 scheme for young savers.              
 Examples of these are "The Little     
 Extra Club" (Halifax Building Society)
 and "Super Savers" (Northern Rock     
 Building Society).                    
 The most popular schemes were those   
 which offered gifts such as folders,  
 bags and piggy banks or saver boxes,  
 as all the savings schemes offered    
 almost the same interest rates of     
 around 8% on money invested.          
 In a survey of twelve year old        
 children the Northern Rock and the    
 Trustee Savings Bank schemes were most
 popular.{                             
 Some children said that they did not  
 have enough money to be able to save  
 (average pocket money Â£1.50 per       
 week).Others were able to save through
 income from newspaper rounds etc.     </content>
