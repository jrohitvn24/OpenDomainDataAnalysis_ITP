		<content> The Chapel is a wooden building which 
 was originally built at Grove Farm but
 in 1897 it was moved on rollers to a  
 new site in Fifield Road. It is used  
 regularly and on Sunday mornings a    
{Sunday School}is held between 10.10   
 and 11.00 and about fifteen children  
 usually attend.We play a game and then
 we split up into groups. In the first 
 and second groups we get puzzle sheets
 to do about the Bible stories. At all 
 the special times of the year we have 
 a family service.When it is our       
 Harvest Festival all the old people of
 the village come.At Christmas we      
 perform a play which our parents watch
 and afterwards we have a party that is
 followed by quizzes and a few games.  
 In the summer we go on a day trip.We  
 have a{Monday club}when we play many  
 different games.Adults also attend    
 services in the chapel.               </content>
