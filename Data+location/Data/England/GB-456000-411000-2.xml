		<title>02       THE VICAR</title>
		<content> We interviewed the vicar of{St Peter's
{Church (C.of.E) Askern}and asked him  
 why he liked his job. He said he liked
 it because it was what God wanted him 
 to be. In a year the vicar had twenty 
 to twenty-five weddings, fifty-five   
 to sixty funerals and eighty          
 christenings. The vicar has not got a 
 favourite day or a busiest but        
 Fridays are the quietest because it is
 his day off.                          
           We asked him to describe    
 to us a typical day in his life and   
 this is what he said. He gets up in   
 the morning, has his breakfast, reads 
 a bit of his bible and says his       
 prayers. He works in his study until  
 it is dinner time. After dinner he    
 goes out and visits people. He then   
 has his tea and takes meetings in the 
 evening.                              
                                       </content>
