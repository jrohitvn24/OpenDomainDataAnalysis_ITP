		<title>20BEESTON REGIS GRAVEL PIT</title>
		<content>  The Carter Concrete gravel pit covers
 an area of 10 hectares, and quarries  
 70,000 tonnes of{gravel}per year.     
  The plant costs Â£1 million per year  
 to run, and employs 59 workers.  It   
 has 9 vehicles, a Â£500,000 Grading    
 Plant, excavators and many machines   
 for making various blocks or beams.   
  Gravel is excavated from the huge    
 face (which is 450 metres long and 25 
 metres high) and taken to the Grading 
 Plant where it is washed and sorted   
 into 5 sizes: 40mm+, 20mm+, 10mm+,    
 3mm+, and sand.  It can then be       
 despatched in 11 to 20 tonne loads.   
 It is also used to make{concrete}items
 such as blocks and beams of all shapes
 and sizes, stairs, lamp-posts and     
 lintels, which are delivered as far   
 away as Hull, Grimsby and London.     
  Sand and gravel, meanwhile, have a   
 more local market.                    </content>
