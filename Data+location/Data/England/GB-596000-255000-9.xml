		<content> 41% of local residents in paid employ-
 ment work in the area. Although the   
 majority work in{agriculture}there are
 also some other{self employed}persons 
 working from home. These include a    
 freelance designer, an architect, and 
 a specialised publisher. Many have    
 come to the area attracted by the     
 peace and the environment. The easy   
 access to London (while generally     
 being beyond daily commuting) is an   
 advantage.                            
 20% work in{Stowmarket}which, with its
 range of employment, lies within 10   
 minutes drive of the area. 5% work in 
{Bury St Edmunds}and 5% in{Ipswich,    
 both towns easily reached by car. The 
 improvements to the A45 have reduced  
 journey times, particularly to        
 Ipswich. 19% work elsewhere within    
 10 km, 5% within 10/25 km, and 5% over
 25 km.                                </content>
