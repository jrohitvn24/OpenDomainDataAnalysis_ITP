		<content> MONDAY 1st JULY 1985                  
   Monday morning I got up very early. 
 I had chocolate Ready Break for my    
 breakfast. I got dressed and went to  
 school and played for a bit. The      
 school whistle went and we lined up.  
 We were the first to go in. We went   
 upstairs, took our coats off and went 
 to our classrooms to work. We went    
 down to the hall for hymns. We went   
 back to the classroom and got on with 
 our diary. We played out and I played 
 with Jane with two balls. We came in  
 then for baths and Mrs. Murphy said   
 that the water was cold so we swam    
 round three times and got out. It was 
 dinner time and I went home and I had 
 chicken soup. I returned to school and
 got on with my work. Then it was home 
 time and I watched Childrens ITV, I   
 played out, came in,watched Coronation
 St. and Brookside. Then I went to bed.</content>
