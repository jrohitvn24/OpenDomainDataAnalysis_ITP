		<content> Aston Somerville school, educating    
 children from 5 to 14 years, closed in
 1969. Childswickham school closed in  
 1980, both closures caused by falling 
 rolls. The children now travel to     
 schools in other villages. The 5-10   
 age group go to First Schools,        
 Childswickham children to Broadway,   
 Aston Somerville children to          
 Sedgeberrow. The 10-13 age group go to
 Bredon Hill Middle School in Ashton   
 under Hill, moving on to Prince       
 Henry's High School in Evesham at 13  
 and leaving at either 16 or 18 years  
 old. Some children from the villages  
 attend the Roman Catholic School in   
 Broadway others go to Private Schools 
 in the area. Children attending state 
 schools are provided with free        
 transport as they live 3 miles from   
 the schools.
