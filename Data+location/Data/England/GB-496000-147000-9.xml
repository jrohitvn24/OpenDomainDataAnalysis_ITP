		<content>  The Guildford area contains churches 
 of several denominations : Anglican   
 (high and low), United Reformed,      
 Baptist and Christadelphian. The      
 churches are Holy Trinity, Saint      
 Mary's, Saint Saviour's, All Saints,  
 Saint Nicholas, Millmead Centre and a 
 United Reformed Church.               
  The area enjoys an active religious  
 life, which is indicated by the       
 increasing size of congregations. The 
 largest are at Saint Saviour's and    
 Millmead, with 500 to 600 regular     
 participants. Evangelistic activities 
 centre on the busy High Street.       
  Each church holds creches, Sunday    
 Schools and youth groups. These youth 
 groups, such as "Wayfarers" at Saint  
 Saviour's, provide the opportunity for
 religious instruction and socialising.
