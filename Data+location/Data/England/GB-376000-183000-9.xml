		<title>09A POLICEMAN IN HORTON</title>
		<content>   This morning we had a country       
 policeman to school and he told us    
 what it would be like to be a         
 policeman.When he was a boy he wanted 
 to be a policeman and I wouldn't mind 
 to be one as well. The Police car is  
 called a panda car because of the     
 stripes down it, and the policeman are
 called bobbies because the man who    
 invented police was called Robert.The 
 number on the shoulder of a policeman 
 is if they do naughty things they can 
 be found.I am quite glad of policemen 
 and women otherwise the world would be
 in a state. The Police Constable liked
 his job very much.He can go to schools
 to talk to children and show them how 
 to ride their bikes carefully and     
 teach them the Highway Code. He has   
 also been in a couple of fights in his
 time.                          Duncan
