		<content> We looked at where people come from   
 and where people go to in Marston     
 Montgomery. These are the questions we
 asked.                                
  1.What made you move here?           
  2.Where did you move from?           
  3.How long have you lived here ?     
  4.If you move again where will you   
 live?                                 
 The reasons people had for moving to  
 the village were,because they liked   
 the house and the village,because     
 their relations lived near Marston and
 they work near Marston.A few people   
 want to move to other parts of        
 Derbyshire.Some people have lived in  
 Marston for 19 years or more.One of us
 found out that a family were looking  
 for an old house with a large garden  
 in a village.A suitable property was  
 for sale in Marston.They lived in     
 Wrexham before.The've been here 1 yr. </content>
