		<title>03GARSDON FARMING</title>
		<content>    On the farm where my Dad works     
 crops are important because there are 
 three fields of rape also corn, wheat 
 and grassland. Some young cows are on 
 the grasslands. There is plenty of    
 grassland for cows to feed on. The    
 older cows go away when they are fat. 
 They get killed and are used for beef.
 In the summer, silage is made and Dad 
 is busy hay making. He has a round    
 baler. The straw goes up into the     
 baler, gets twirled around,then string
 lets the straw go around and it       
 twists together. The big round bale   
 comes out of the back. It just carries
 on like that. My Dad and I go out each
 morning to check that the cows are all
 well.                                 
    Other farms in this area do have   
 milking herds.
