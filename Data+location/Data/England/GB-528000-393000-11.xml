		<content> On Bank Holiday Monday at 6 o'clock in
 the morning I had to get up and get   
 ready for riding. I walked down to my 
 friend and got my pony ready to go to 
 Leicester. The people who were taking 
 me came. I put Sox my pony in the     
 horse box. It took us about 2 and a   
 half hours to get to Leicester. Then  
 we got the ponies out and met up with 
 my team. There are 5 people in the    
 team. Their names are Katie Needam,   
 Joanna Haxby, Caroline Griffiths,     
 Charlotte Cox and me. We had tack and 
 turnout first and then the games      
 began. We were in the lead and then we
 dropped down to second and then again 
 to third, so we were pleased.
