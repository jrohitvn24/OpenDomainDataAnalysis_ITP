		<title>07SCHOOL HASELOR, WARKS.</title>
		<content> When I get to school I usually play   
 football. Miss Fox rings the bell in  
 the bell tower on the school roof to  
 tell us to go into to schol to start  
 lessons. On Mondays we get our maths  
 books out,after maths we have Prayers.
 We sing one hymn and talk about people
 as well as saying prayers. Each class 
 takes it in turns to do Prayers for a 
 week.Then it is playtime,we go outside
 and play.Sometimes I play football and
 sometimes I play volleyball.At the end
 of play a 4th year child rings a hand 
 bell to tell the school that play has 
 ended.They take it in turn to be bell 
 monitor.All the children have to line 
 up in the playground in their classes 
 until the bell monitor tells them to  
 go into class.After play it is music, 
 we sing songs for that.It is English  
 then,we do it from a book, it is      
 usually questions to answer.          </content>
