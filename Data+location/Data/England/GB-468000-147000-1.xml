		<title>01Upton Grey and its Environs</title>
		<content> Upton Grey is situated midst good corn
 growing farmland some 5 miles SE of   
 Basingstoke and 2\ miles SW of Odiham.
 There is also some grazing for cattle 
 and sheep and the country is inter-   
 spersed with woods. Fields tend to be 
 large but there are old hedgerows     
 remaining and replanting is being     
 carried out. Farming is the main      
 industry but on the outskirts of the  
 village there is a flourishing haulage
 business and there is some building   
 work. Most of the village's residents 
 work outside the immediate area.      
 Amongst the important houses are      
 Hoddington House, Upton Grey House and
 the Manor House. The village is       
 attractive and self sufficient with   
 its church, shop, post office, inn,   
 hall and pond. The vicar is shared    
 with neighbouring villages. The River 
 Whitewater rises at Bidden to the NW. </content>
