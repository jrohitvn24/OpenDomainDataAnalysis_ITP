		<title>02Hangars at Cardington</title>
		<content>     At  the  western edge of our block
 are  the  giant hangars at Cardington.
 They can be seen from miles around and
 are a very  important reminder  of the
 past.  They  are  800  feet  long  and
 nearly 180 feet high.  Their width  is
 270 feet. The main doors have a weight
 of 940 tons.  They  run  on  rails and
 need an electric motor to open them.  
                                       
     The first  one was put up in 1917,
 but  made  bigger  when the second was
 brought from Norfolk  and built in the
 late 1920s.  It was then  thought that
 Cardington   would  be  the  home   of
 airship   travel .  The   two    giant
 airships  the  R100  and the R101 were
 kept there.  The R101 was built by the
 Royal Airship Works.                  
                                       
     The  disasterous crash of the R101
 ended a  dream  for many local people.</content>
