		<title>06Breeds of sheep</title>
		<content> The main anilmals kept on farms are   
 sheep, cows and beef cattle.          
 The breeds of sheep most common are   
 Swaledales, which have black faces    
 with speckled grey noses and legs, and
 live most of their lives on the open  
 moors but most of the ewes are brought
 into enclosed land for a few weeks    
 during the spring for lambing.        
 The second most popular breeds are    
 Suffolk and Scotch.                   
 Suffolk sheep have short tight wool   
 and black faces and are kept on the   
 enclosed farms.                       
 Scotch sheep have black and white     
 faces and long woollen coats.         
 Also popular with farmers wives are   
 Jacob sheep which provide a good      
 fleece for spinning and make hard     
 wearing garments for the working      
 family.
