		<title>04PEEL HALL FARM</title>
		<content>  Peel Hall has an interesting past,   
 was one of the peels used for purposes
 of habitation and defence. Peel  means
 farmhouse fortified by moat or        
 palisade. Farm has a moat round the   
 house used for defence, When invaders 
 were near owners would take the       
 animals into the large dry stone      
 cellars of the building until danger  
 had passed. Present owner, many years 
 ago, drained the moat and rebuilt the 
 walls in sandstone. Depth varies from 
 6-9 feet is 20 feet wide and 0.25 acre
 in area. House and moat are fed by    
 spring water. Farm has been in family 
 since 1897. Present owner has farmed  
 here for past 25 years. This farm is  
 210 acres, has 175 cows looked after  
 by 3 people. Cows are bred for sale   
 and milk production. Today the milk   
 yields and feeding are recorded by    
 computer.                             </content>
