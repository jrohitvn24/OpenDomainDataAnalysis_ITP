		<content>  There are eight or nine auctioneers. 
  On Wednesdays they sell about 400    
calves, 100 cows, 1,500 store cattle   
and 100 dairy cows. They also sell     
young pigs.                            
  On Thursdays they sell for meat. They
sell about 1,000 fat cattle, 400 fat   
cows, 1,000 fat pigs and 4,000 fat     
sheep.                                 
  They  sell about 1,500,000 pounds    
worth of stock every week.             
  The most unusual animal that was sold
was a bison.                           
  The most expensive animal was a      
Charolais cross steer. It fetched      
13,000 pounds. Midland Marts got 260   
and the farmer got 12,740.             
  Most of the cattle comes from a fifty
mile radius around Banbury.            
  Here are some of the auctioneers'    
language terms: "Stand-on","Maiden Bid"
and "Been here all night".             </content>
