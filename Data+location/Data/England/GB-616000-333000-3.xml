		<title>03FARMING IN ALDBOROUGH (CONT)</title>
		<content> Sugar beet is drilled in the Spring   
 and harvested between September and   
 Jannary.The crop is sprayed regularly 
 to keep down weeds so there is no need
 for "Singling"the beet.All the beet is
 taken to the Factory at Cantley for   
 sugar production.The better           
 drained Loam soil is good for arable  
 Farming and the water meadows and low 
 lying land are used for sheep and     
 cattle.Sheep and cattle are brought   
 for Fattening.Pigs are bred and either
 sold at market or to a large firm for 
 bacon.Claire wrote that her Father's  
 Farm has changed greatly over the last
 50 years.Then 3 men worked 100 acres. 
 it is 1 man for 400 acres.In 1985     
 there are many hungry people in the   
 world but food mountains in Europe.
