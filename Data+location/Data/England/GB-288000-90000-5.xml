		<content> The farm owned by the well known show 
 jumper Tony Newbury, who trains and   
 rides many champions, was once a 200  
 to 300 acre site under the care of Alf
 Newbury, Tony's father who died in    
 l981. The farm included much of the   
 Marsh Barton trading estate but this  
 has gradually been sold off for       
 building land and is now only about 14
 acres. The stables house 65 horses,   
 half of which are used for show       
 jumping, while others are used for    
 training people who come to the       
 school. One of the school's employees 
 said she wouldn't be surprised if the 
 rest was sold off for building land   
 over the next few years. The farm     
 house is now flats while the family   
 has recently moved into a new smaller 
 bungalow.
