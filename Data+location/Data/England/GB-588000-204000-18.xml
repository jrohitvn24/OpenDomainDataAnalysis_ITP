		<title>18  A DAY AT PLUME SCHOOL</title>
		<content> I get to school by the Eastern        
 National bus and because I live within
 3 miles of the school my bus fare is  
 30 pence each day- 15 pence each way. 
   I arrive at school at about 9 a.m.  
 which is just right because school    
 commences at 9.05. Then our form      
 teacher,Mrs. Neale, comes to take the 
 register before we go to our first    
 lesson.                               
   After the sixth lesson ends at 1.10 
 p.m.we line up outside the stage hall 
 where we buy our dinner. Sixty pence  
 is about enough to buy a dinner. If   
 you want you can bring sandwiches to  
 school and eat them in an outside     
 classroom set aside for that purpose. 
   There is a tuckshop where you can   
 buy crisps and sweets at break and    
 lunchtime. At 2.o5 there is afternoon 
 registration,Assembly and 2 more      
 lessons before we go home. Megan Jones</content>
