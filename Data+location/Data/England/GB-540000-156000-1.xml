The nearest major towns to Biggin Hill 
are Croydon and Bromley. London is     
about twenty miles away. The coast is  
approximately one hours drive away. The
countryside in our area is very lush.  
It is quiet and peaceful. The area is  
covered mostly by farmland, woodland   
and urban development. Some of the many
interesting things around include      
Chartwell, Westerham village and St.   
Mark's Church. Canterbury is worth a   
visit taking about two hours drive from
here to there. Tatsfield village is    
much smaller than Biggin Hill. It is a 
traditional village with a church and  
school. Some of the houses are built   
around a green with a pond.
