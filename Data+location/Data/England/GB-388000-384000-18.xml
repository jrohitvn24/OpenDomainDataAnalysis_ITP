		<title>18LIKES AND DISLIKES - PART 2</title>
		<content> One of the things I hate doing is     
 picking the leaves off our lawn and   
 washing the pots for my dad.  Another 
 thing I hate doing best is emptying   
 the airing cupboard for my mum. The   
 food I don't like is potatoes and     
 potato hash and sausages.  Another    
 thing that I don't like is when my mum
 doesn't give me any pocket money      
 because I dont empty my bag, and don't
 take my shoes off. We have to because 
 we have a new rug in our lounge.      
 Another thing I don't like is when my 
 mum and dad go out to restaurants and 
 I have to stay in bed having a        
 horrible time trying to get to sleep  
 while my mum and dad are having a     
 lovely time eating. Another thing I   
 hate doing is having to wear my       
 blouses because I dont like blouses.  
                                       
                                       </content>
