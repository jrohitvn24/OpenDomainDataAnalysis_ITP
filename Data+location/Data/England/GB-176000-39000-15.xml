		<title>15MOUNT WELLINGTON MINE</title>
		<content>  Mount Wellington  tin mine  opened in
 the 1930's and closed in 1939,  due to
 the war.  It operated again from 1972-
 78, then joined with Wheal Jane to re-
 open under new management in 1980.    
  It produces  about  300 tonnes of ore
 daily, which yields  approx 2   tonnes
 of metal (600 tonnes a year). The  ore
 goes under ground to  Wheal Jane where
 it  is  crushed  into  concentrate and
 sold to the smelters at Hull.         
  One tonne of tin is worth Â£10,000,and
 concentrate about Â£6,000, according to
 its purity.                           
  About 30 men are employed at the mine
 but it  is illegal  for women  to work
 underground. All underground machinery
 is  powered by  compressed  air except
 for battery operated rock-carriers.   
  4,000,000  gals  of water  a  day are
 pumped through an adit into the Carnon
 River.                                </content>
