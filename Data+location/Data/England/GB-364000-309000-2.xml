		<title>02The Vicar of Hadley 1985</title>
		<content>  Population increases have meant that 
 each parish priest has a larger       
 territory to cover and a greater      
 number of souls to care for{.         
  When{Holy Trinity Church}was built in
 1856,its minister,Rev.James Barton,   
 had 1200 parishoners.Since then Hadley
 has expanded and Leegomery has been   
 built so that there are now 9000      
 people in the parish.                 
  The present vicar,Rev.Maurice Young, 
 an army officer for 30 yrs.,was       
 ordained at the age of 50.This pattern
 is becoming more common.              
  With high numbers,much of the vicar's
 time is spent on baptisms,marriages   
 and deaths_rituals still in demand in 
 a largely post-Christian era.         
  Regular Church adherents number about
 150 with 60 to 70 attending main      
 services on Sunday mornings.
