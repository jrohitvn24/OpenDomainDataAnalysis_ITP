		<title>13MOLESEY CARNIVAL</title>
		<content>   Molesey Carnival has been a regular 
 event for many years.  It starts just 
 after midday and is always on the     
 first Saturday in June.  In 1985 the  
 Molesey Carnival fell on June 1st.    
 The police stop all traffic in Walton 
 Road a few minutes before the carnival
 begins.  It is always led by the Mayor
 of Elmbridge and his children and     
 sometimes a few friends.  Next is     
 always a band followed by the first   
 float.  This carries the Carnival     
 Queen.  Then come an assortment of    
 floats entered by local shops, pubs   
 and groups.  There are always many    
 other people on foot dressed up in    
 various disguises.  The procession    
 makes it's way along Walton Road to   
 the recreation ground where there are 
 stalls and sideshows.
