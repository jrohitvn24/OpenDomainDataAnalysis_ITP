		<title>10HEYBROOK BAY 1</title>
		<content>{Mrs B.Wanstall}a resident since 1960  
 was interviewed and said that{Heybrook
{Drive}in 1960 was a track and cars wo-
 uld not go down.There were about 40   
 houses in the bay in 1960,and the land
 on which the{Longlands Estate}was     
 later built was just a field in which 
 she used to go mushroom picking.They  
 had{filled the ruts}as best they      
 could,as the{Council}refused to make  
 up the road,but they promised to adopt
 it if residents would get it repaired,
 every house was canvassed,and most    
 people agreed to pay for their own    
 frontage at Â£1 per foot.Before the    
 road was{adopted by the Council the   
 sewage system led out into the bay.   
 Most wanted to go on mains{drainage,so
 the new road was dug up yet again for 
{the sewer.}The Guest House at the     
 bottom of{Heybrook Bay}is the only    
 hotel in the bay now.                 </content>
