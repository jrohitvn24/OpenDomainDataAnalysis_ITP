 to be used for the bedding for the    
 animals as well as for food. She grows

   Mrs Large was very upset this year  
 because she had to sell 40 cows. This 
 was because she was producing too much
 milk.this meant that she would be     
 fined by the Commision.However if her 
 calves were bull calves then the Milk 
 Marketing Board would give her Â£600,  
 because a bull cow cannot produce     
 milk.
