		<title>01Lincoln Edge Farmland</title>
		<content> This area covers part of the ridge    
 known as the Lincoln Edge or Cliffe,  
 which runs south from Lincoln, and the
 farmland to the west of it. This is   
 intensively farmed arable and         
 grassland. The main crops being Wheat,
 Barley, Oilseed Rape, Peas, Potatoes  
 and sugar beet with both beef cattle  
 and sheep being raised on the         
 grassland. The villages in the area   
 are small with few amenities and now  
 that farming is mechanised and fewer  
 people are needed to work the land    
 many people have to find jobs in      
 nearby towns. The children are also   
 'Bussed ' to schools (primary and     
 secondary) in other areas. This means 
 that the villages have become         
 dormitories and the motor car is      
 essentially for transport to shops,   
 doctors surgery etc. where there is no
 local bus service                     </content>
