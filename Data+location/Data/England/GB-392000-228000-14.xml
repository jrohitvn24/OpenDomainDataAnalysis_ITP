		<content>     Family sizes are generally small  
 and consist on average of 2 parents   
 and 2 children.Families with 3 or 4   
 children are unusual.Few families have
 elderly parents living with them and  
 the trend towards increasd divorce is 
 leading to more {single parent        
{families.}The birth rate is low and   
 consequently the population is        
 gradually becoming more{aged.}A higher
 standard of living and improvements in
 living standards in recent years has  
 resulted in people living longer.     
     A survey carried out in the Hardy 
 Road area of Bishops Cleeve showed a  
 very high proportion of people aged   
 over 65 years.The people living in    
 this area have retired to easily      
 maintained bungalows with small       
 gardens on the edge of a village which
 provides all the essential services.
