		<content> WE INTERVIEWED{2 GRANDADS,}ASKING     
 THEM ABOUT THE WAR AND THINGS THEY    
 REMEMBERED FROM{50 YEARS AGO.}THEY    
 SAID FARM MACHINERY HAS CHANGED, THEY 
 USED HORSES TO DRAW CARTS AND TO      
 PLOUGH. HOUSES HAVE CHANGED A GREAT   
 DEAL SINCE THE WAR, BRICKS ARE USED   
 MUCH MORE NOW, UP TO THE WAR HOUSES   
 WERE MADE OF{LOCAL FLINT.}FOOD IS VERY
 DIFFERENT FROM THE FOOD THEY USED TO  
 EAT. CARS WERE VERY RARE, BUT A LOT   
 STRONGER THAN THEY ARE NOW. THEY COULD
 REMEMBER LORRIES, MADE FROM STEEL, AND
 BIKES, WHICH WERE VERY HEAVY. THEIR   
 TEACHERS WERE VERY STRICT AND USED THE
 CANE BUT THEY ENJOYED PLAYING CRICKET,
 FOOTBALL AND ROUNDERS, AND AT PLAYTIME
 THEY WOULD PLAY WITH{SPINNING TOPS,   
{MARBLES AND HOOPS.}THE DISUSED RAILWAY
 CUTTING RUNS PAST OUR SCHOOL AND THE  
 GRANDADS COULD REMEMBER WHEN THE      
 TRAINS RAN ALONG IT.                  </content>
