		<content> Of Whorlton's ruined motte and bailey 
{castle}only the 14th-century gatehouse
 bearing the arms of Meynell, Darcy    
 and Grey, and vaulted cellars of an   
 earlier date remain. The castle is    
 privately owned and although made safe
 by the Department of the Environment, 
 its isolated position encourages      
 vandalism. A local group, "Friends of 
 the Castle", periodically tidies up   
 the gatehouse and surroundings.       
{Old Whorlton Church}stands in the     
 parish burial ground which is still   
 used. Only the chancel with a Norman  
 arch, the columns of the south arcade 
 dating from the 12th century and the  
 north arcade into which was built the 
 14th-century tower still stand. Inside
 the chancel is the early 14th-century 
 oak effigy of Sir Nicholas de Meynell,
 well preserved.
