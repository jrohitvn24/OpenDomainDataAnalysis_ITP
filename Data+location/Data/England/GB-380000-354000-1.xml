		<title>01CHESHIRE_STAFFS BORDER AREA.</title>
		<content> Our survey square straddles the       
 Cheshire-Staffordshire border         
 covering areas on the S.E.fringes of  
 the Cheshire Plain and the Pennine    
 foothills. The area is largely        
 agricultural, mainly dairy farms,     
 whose milk production goes towards the
 famous Cheshire cheese but with       
 pockets of industry. For example      
 computer manufacture, sanitary ware   
 production and a sand quarry. The     
 main settlements are Alsager and Butt 
 Lane with the village of Church Lawton
 and the fringes of Rode Heath and     
 Scholar Green. Alsager serves largely 
 as a dormitory town and has expanded  
 rapidly since the mid-century. Butt   
 Lane, on the northern edge of the     
 Stoke-on-Trent connurbation, was once 
 a largely coal-mining area but now has
 a more mixed industrial estate.
