		<content>  {We asked a group of 11 to 15 year   
{old children to answer an individual  
{questionnaire about their homes,      
{possessions and use of leisure time.  
{From this we draw the following       
{conclusions:-                         
   'D' block has 5,233 dwellings. 61%  
 of the dwellings are owner-occupied.  
 The remaining 39% are rented from     
 Sedgefield District Council. 50% of   
 the total number of dwellings are     
 semi-detached houses, 38% are terraced
 and 12% detached.                     
   An average family will have 2 or 3  
 children. Approximately 15% have one

 lived in Spennymoor. 2 out of 3
