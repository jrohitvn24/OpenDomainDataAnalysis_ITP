		<title>13ECOLOGY IN WESTFIELD</title>
		<content> Lolly Moor Nature Reserve is in the   
 small village of Westfield.           
 It used to be a fuel allotment for the
 poor of the parish but now it is let  
 by the parish council to the Norfolk  
 Naturalist Trust.                     
 The land is low lying marshland next  
 to a tributary of the river Tud.      
 The trees were regulary coppiced for  
 fuel but they are now being allowed to
 mature.                               
 It is 5 acres in size and Mr and Mrs  
 Keele who look after it as voluntary  
 wardens have been there for 7 years.  
 The different animals that inhabit the
 reserve include hares, field mice,    
 bank voles, moles, stoats and         
 squirrels. There are also 116 types of
 fungi, 5 types of orchids, about 10   
 types of butterfly and 1,000's of     
 different insects.
