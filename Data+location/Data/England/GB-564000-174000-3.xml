		<title>03THE POWER STATION: TILBURY</title>
		<content>{Tilbury Power Station}supplies all of 
 Tilbury's electricity. It dominates   
 the landscape. Power Station A was    
 built near the River Thames in 1950;  
 it was finished in 1957 so we could   
 have light in school and in our       
 houses. It was built near the Thames  
 because it needs water to operate but 
 it can use oil, gas and coal as fuel. 
 The coal comes from Australia on a big
 ship. In 1982 Power Station A was     
 closed down and Power Station B came  
 into operation. 446 people work       
 there; 14 of these people have        
 children at our school. The large     
 chimney pots are 185m high and 10m    
 wide. Out in my garden I can hear the 
 Power Station making a noise and I can
 see the big chimney pots and a little 
 bit of the Power Station.
