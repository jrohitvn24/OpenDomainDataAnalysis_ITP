		<content> Communications have been very         
 important to the growth and           
 development of Bexleyheath.  As a     
 result of its position, Bexleyheath   
 has had trackways through it since the
 time of the Ancient Britons.  The     
 modern Watling Street, is part of the 
 Roman Road built from London to Dover.
 This road passed through Bexleyheath  
 to the south of the present Broadway. 
 The Broadway is the main east-west    
 route through Bexleyheath.  With the  
 new Shopping Complex, there are plans 
 to pedestrianise the central section  
 of the Broadway.  Northern and        
 Southern relief roads will be built to
 take traffic around the Broadway.     
 Public opinions about the changes have
 been mixed.  However, most people     
 would like to see an improved bus link
 between the Shopping Complex and the  
 railway station, a mile away.         </content>
