		<title>18 DAILY LIFE IN KENNINGTON</title>
		<content> On weekdays, working couples and      
 school children wake between six and  
 eight o'clock. As most people work    
 Monday to Friday, the family is toge- 
 ther during the evening, when they    
 have a hot meal, and the watch the    
 television together. Many of{KENNING- 
{TON'S}appliances are electrical, the  
 electricity comes from the{NATIONAL   
{GRID.}During the day, families use    
 many electrical appliances.           
 Non-electrical things are: taps,      
 baths, and the toilet. People get milk
 and letters delivered to their door   
 for them. The normal number of rooms  
 in a house is eight (including the    
 landing/stairs),three bedrooms, a     
 bathroom, a living room, a sitting    
 room, and a kitchen. Many families    
 live in an area that is residential,  
 and the average{KENNINGTON}family     
 consists of two adults &amp; two children.</content>
