		<content>{LOCAL HISTORY WOODHALL SPA}           
 Whilst boring for coal in 1811 very   
 rich mineral waters were discovered.In
 1834 a bath house was made by Thomas  
 Hotchkin,the then owner of Woodhall   
 and it became known as Woodhall Spa.  
 These waters were used by rheumatism  
 sufferers until 1984 when the bath    
 house's foundations collapsed.The     
 remains of Kirkstead Abbey still stand
 with its 13th century Chapel of St.   
 Leonards within its vicinity.The River
 Witham flows through Kirkstead and    
 prior to the construction of the      
 bridge in 1968 the river was crossed  
 by ferry and footbridge.In 1848 a     
 single railway line was built between 
 Boston and Lincoln.The line between   
 Kirkstead and Horncastle was open in  
 1855.The lines closed in 1971.W.W.11  
 RAF Squadron 617,The Dambusters,had   
 their mess in the Petwood Hotel.      </content>
