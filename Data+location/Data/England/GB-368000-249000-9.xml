		<content> The main employment is in farming,    
 mostly full time permanent work.There 
 is also casual work at fruit picking  
 time, in spring and autumn with hops, 
 and in the autumn with potatoes. One  
 farm has a hauliers business attached.
 Apart from those who work on farms,   
 others live and work in the area,     
 these include: two florists with their
 own greenhouses, a landscape gardener 
 and rose grower, a nurseryman, and the
 postmistress. Some are free lance with
 part time work elsewhere, such as two 
 sculptors one of whom teaches in      
 Malvern, and an artist who illustrates
 children's books and works in Malvern.
 Residents who work outside the area   
 include: anaesthetist, nurse, two     
 hospital ancillary workers, baker. and
 cook.A motor mechanic who owns a      
 garage is probably the only person who
 comes into the area to work.          </content>
