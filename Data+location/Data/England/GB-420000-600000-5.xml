		<title>05Acklington Agricult'l Garage</title>
		<content>{Acklington Garage}is owned by I.&amp; M.  
 Pearson. It is a garage which chiefly 
 deals with agricultural repairs and   
 supplies. Until recently it was also a
 petrol filling station, but poor sales
 meant that this service was stopped.  
                                       
 There are{9 workers}(4 from Alnwick, 3
 from Acklington and 2 from Amble)     
 including 2 ladies who work in the    
 office. The youngest worker is aged 16
                                       
 The garage is very well supported     
 (especially in the summer) by local   
 farmers who buy, or rent, the various 
{machinery.}Most of the machinery comes
 from the Continent and includes:      
 fertilizer spinners from Belgium,     
 balers from France, harrows from      
 Italy, tractors from Germany,         
 harvesters from Denmark as well as    
 trailers and gates from the U.K.      </content>
