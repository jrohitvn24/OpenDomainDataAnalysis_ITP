		<title>10TRANSPORT AROUND DURSLEY</title>
		<content>   In the largely rural area around    
 Dursley the most used form of         
 transport is the car.It is almost a   
 necessity because of the cuts made in 
 services provided by public           
 transport.From Dursley itself there   
 are regular though infrequent bus     
 services to Cheltenham,Gloucester,    
 Bristol,Stroud and smaller towns en   
 route.                                
   Services have been reduced or       
 withdrawn on economic grounds.People  
 without cars especially the older     
 citizens suffer by this lack of       
 facility.                             
   Bus routes are mainly serviced by   
 the Cheltenham and Gloucester Omnibus 
 Company but some less frequent        
 services providing links in the rural 
 areas are undertaken by private firms.
