		<title>19COMPUTERS IN THE 1980'S</title>
		<content>  Computers are a large part of our    
 lives and are often used at home as   
 games machines.                       
  A group of 12 year olds were         
 interviewed about their favourite     
 computer games and it was discovered  
 that the most popular game was{       
{Frogger.}This is an arcade game in    
 which the frog, controlled by the     
 player, has to cross over the road    
 dodging the rush hour traffic and then
 across the river.                     
  The school's head of computers, Mr.J.
 Pearson believes that software for    
 schools needs futher development. A   
 disadvantage is that only a few can   
 use the software at one time. He      
 thinks however, that computers will   
 become cheaper, smaller and very much 
 improved and will therefore be more   
 widely used in schools.
