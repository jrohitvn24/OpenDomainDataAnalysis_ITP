		<title>18  Improvements  to  Wootton.</title>
		<content>   Even though we have a play school   
in Wootton, many people would like a   
nursery school as well. The primary    
school itself is in poor condition and 
needs replacing or improving.          
   We do have a playground and         
recreation ground but many children do 
not have enough to do when they come   
home from school.                      
   More local medical care is needed   
for children and old people and old    
people also have difficulty getting on 
and off the buses. They need some good 
bus shelters where they can sit down.  
   The church needs repairs doing to   
the tower and the roads are in a bad   
state and dangerous in some places.    
   Although some houses are being      
built, most people do not want the     
village to get any bigger.
