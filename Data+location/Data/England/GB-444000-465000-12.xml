		<content> Myton-on-Swale                        
 The name Myton which in the past has  
 been spelt Mitane, Milton &amp; Miton is  
 derived from two saxon words meaning a
 lake or pool and a town.              
 Tholthorpe                            
 Originally believed to be the         
 'village'(Thorpe) of Thurulf a        
 Norseman but in the Domesday book     
 prefixed Thorald and belonging to the 
 Soke of Helperby was later Thol, 'a   
 resting place'.  Drovers on their     
 journey to York from the North,       
 watering and resting their cattle     
 here.                                 
 Ten Mile Hill, to the west of the     
 village, the source of numerous human 
 bones and stoneage tools, is believed 
 to have been the scene of some        
 terrible battle upon which history is 
 silent.
