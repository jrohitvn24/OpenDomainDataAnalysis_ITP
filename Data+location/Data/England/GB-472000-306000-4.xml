		<content> The main crops grown for cash on mixed
 farms here are wheat and barley with a
 small amount of oats. These are{sown  
 mainly in autumn and{harvested}in July
 and August.They must be{sprayed       
 against pests and diseases once or    
 twice annually and the land fertilised
 They are harvested either by the      
 farmer himself, if he owns a{combine  
 or the harvesting may be contracted   
 out.The stacking of{straw bales}left  
 after harvest is a time-consuming and 
 heavy task carried out by all the     
 farmers family who are able. However  
 this job is being increasingly        
 mechanised.This straw is used as feed 
 and litter for the livestock or some  
 times it is sold.Some farmers have    
{mechanised grain handling facilities  
 and are able to store the grain until 
 the market price is right.{Drying     
{facilities}are necessary in wet years.</content>
