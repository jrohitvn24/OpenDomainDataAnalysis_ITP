 There are council estates built of    
 brick. Some new houses are built of   
 bricks with tiled rooves. All of the  
 old houses are still lived in. Most   
 look the same on the outside as they  
 always did except for some have modern
 doors and new windows and porches.    
 Some houses are very new. Some houses 
 are terraced, some semi-detached and  
 some are detached. Some houses are big
 and some are very small. Some are     
 owned by people who have come here to 
 retire. Some are owned by people who  
 come here for weekends and live       
 somewhere else. Some people have lived
 in the same houses all their lives and
 some people's parents lived in the    
 same house before they did.
