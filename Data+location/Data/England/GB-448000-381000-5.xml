		<title>05MANOR FARM</title>
		<content>   There has been a farm on this site  
 for longer than anyone can remember.  
   Originally it was a mixed farm of   
 160 acres but 40 acres was sold in    
 1967 to build the school and housing  
 estate. Recently it has specialised in
 intensive pig farming with up to 1200 
 pigs. When Farmer Moore wanted to     
 increase the number of pigs there was 
 insufficient space near the house     
 without causing offence to the nearby 
 residents. Therefore the outlying land
 has been sold to other farmers and the
 land around the farmhouse and the     
 adjoining vicarage grounds has been   
 sold to Tarmac Homes for private      
 housing development.                  
   There has been a great deal of local
 opposition to the sale of land,       
 particularly from residents  whose    
 houses will overlook the new          
 development.                          </content>
