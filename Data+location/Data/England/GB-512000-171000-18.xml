		<title>18SHOPPING SURVEY IN HAMPTON</title>
		<content> We did our shopping survey in Hampton 
 shopping precinct. We asked six       
 shoppers seven different questions. 5 
 of the people we asked were shopping  
 and 1 person was having a drink in the
 pub. 2 people walked there,3 people   
 came by car and 1 person cycled. It   
 took 5 of the people less than 10     
 mins.to get there and it took 1 person
 15 mins. to get there. 4 of the       
 shoppers came to the precinct more    
 than once a week, 1 person came about 
 once a month and 1 person came once a 
 week. None of the people would buy    
 furniture or clothes in the precinct  
 because the shops were too small. All 
 the people were only buying food.The  
 main food shop was Sainsburys.  All   
 the people lived in Hampton  except   
 for one person who lived in           
 Teddington.
