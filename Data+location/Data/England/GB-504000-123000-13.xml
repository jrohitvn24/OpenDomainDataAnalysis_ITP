		<title>13WISBOROUGH GREEN GLEBE</title>
		<content> Before the twentieth century the      
 vicar's income depended on tithes from
 the local farmers. Each farmer donated
 one tenth of his income. He was then  
 entitled to his own seat in the       
 church. These pews can be seen in the 
 church with the names of the farms    
 carved on them. The vicar also had his
 Glebe.                                
     The Wisborough Green Glebe        
 includes the Glebe field, between the 
 pond and the church, and the land on  
 which the vicarage and Glebe Way now  
 stand. On this land the vicar could   
 pasture his animals.                  
      This land was taken over by the  
 state, and the income given to the    
 church, in 1920. The vicar was the    
 only person in the village who was    
 allowed to brew and sell beer. The    
 brewhouse is still there.
