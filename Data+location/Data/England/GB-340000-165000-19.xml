		<title>19HEALTH IN YATTON</title>
		<content>      Yatton has a modern              
 health centre. From here, three       
 doctors run a group practice. There   
 are dentists and a chiropodist in the 
 village. At Yatton Hall, mentally     
 handicapped people are cared for.  The
 adult patients are taught social      
 skills with a view to eventually      
 integrating them with the community.  
 The policy of sending them out into   
 the community has recently been       
 accelerated, leading to much criticism
 and concern for their welfare. There  
 is a special children's unit at Yatton
 Hall, dealing with both resident and  
 non-resident patients. Villagers      
 provide extra facilities through the  
 Friends of Yatton Hall. Older         
 residents of the village are cared    
 for in sheltered accommodation run by 
 the Methodists and the British Legion.
