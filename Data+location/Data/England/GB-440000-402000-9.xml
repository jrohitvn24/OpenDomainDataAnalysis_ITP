		<title>09Problems in Darfield</title>
		<content>   Our biggest problem in Darfield is  
 graffiti. There is a lot of graffiti  
 because there is little for teenagers 
 to do. There is a shopping centre     
 which is not used a lot. There might  
 be less graffiti if it was made into a
 youth club or sports centre. Apart    
 from that there are no really         
 significant problems in our village.  
 We only have a few criminals and most 
 of the crimes are break-ins. P.C.     
 Boocock,our community policeman is    
 afraid that in the future there will  
 be more.                              
   Another problem is the closure of   
 Darfield Main Colliery. There will be 
 a lot of people without jobs.         
   I do not think we have much of a    
 health problem in Darfield. The       
 biggest worries are diseases          
 associated with smoking and obesity.
