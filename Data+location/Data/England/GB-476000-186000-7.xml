		<title>07The Rector of Hambleden.</title>
		<content>Our Rector is responsible for a certain
area.This area has five parishes.The   
schools in his area are Hambleden,     
Frieth and Danesfield.Our school is a  
church school so it is run with the    
help of the church.The rector spends a 
lot of time getting people ready for   
their marriage.They meet and talk with 
him five times before they are actually
wed.He also comes to teach us about    
God.His job is to tell everyone that   
whatever happens the Lord still loves  
them.He comforts the family of someone 
who has just died.Every day is a long  
and heavy day for him.The lightest day 
of the week is Sunday.If someone is    
dying Mr.Joyce must drop whatever he is
doing and call on them.He has two      
retired priests and a full time priest 
to help him.
