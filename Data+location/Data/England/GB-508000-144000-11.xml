		<title>11BANK HOLIDAY ACTIVITIES</title>
		<content> On May Day Bank Holiday my brother    
 Matthew and I went to a Cub Woodrow   
 Trophy Competition.  We did a lot of  
 things there.  We did an obstacle     
 course, nature observation, tent      
 pitching, fire lighting, compass      
 trails and First Aid.  We had         
 different names for the day.  My group
 was called Earwigs.  There were lots  
 of other groups.  I lost my cap there.

 I woke up a 7 a.m. and read three     
 chapters of Wind in the Willows.I then
 watched Breakfast T.V. for a while,   
 and then we had breakfast.  After     
 washing up we all got into the car.We 
 went to a nursery to get some plants. 
 When we had collected the plants and  
 looked around for a bit, we went home 
 to put the plants in the garden. After
 that we went to Pitch Hill for a walk 
 and a picnic.                         </content>
