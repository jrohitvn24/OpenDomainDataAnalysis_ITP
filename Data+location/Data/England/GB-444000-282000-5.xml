		<content> A small pond was dug in the           
 conservation area by a local man using
 a mechanical digger and although the  
 water level did not stay up long it   
 has proved to be an invaluable  site  
 for many types of pond life.During    
 1985 a larger pond was dug which has  
 proved more successful.The pond       
 provides just one type of habitat.Also
 in the area we have planted many trees
 and bushes and grown wild flowers to  
 put in the area such as;corn cockle,  
 corn marigold,poppies,may weed, purple
 loosestrife,and white campion.The pond
 has attracted many insects and frogs  
 and provides a valuable source of food
 for swallows,house martins and various
 ducks.We have also planted some       
 special flowers to attract butterflies
 and a hedge to provide yet another    
 type of habitat.
