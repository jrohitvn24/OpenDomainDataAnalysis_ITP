		<title>11BRACE AND PISTOLS PUB</title>
		<content> The owner of the Brace and Pistols was
 interviewed at his pub in St. Johns   
 Street.He has only been there for four
 months.Some time ago the building was 
 a dairy but it was converted to a pub 
 about 30 years ago.                   
 The busiest days of the week are      
 Saturday and Sunday when a lot of     
 people are home from work. The most   
 popular drink is beer. Some people    
 come into the pub when they are on    
 holiday at Clacton which is not very  
 far away. Summer is always busier than
 Winter.The owners previously ran a pub
 at Brightlingsea about 13 kilometres  
 away.They like this area on the edge  
 of Clacton because it is peaceful.The 
 customers are friendly.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
