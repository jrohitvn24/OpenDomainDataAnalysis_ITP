		<content>    Since our area is mainly farmland  
 the ultimate is to achieve highly     
 productive crops.Therefore a great    
 deal of fertiliser and weed killer is 
 used with the result that wild life   
 has suffered.Recently people have     
 become more conscious of the country  
 side deprivation.                     
     In our area we found half an acre 
 of unspoilt meadowland.As we studied  
 this closely we found cowslips,yarrow,
 buttercups,clover,dandelion and       
 plantain.The hedge consisted of       
 different trees the most interesting  
 of which was the elm indicating its   
 return after the ravages of Dutch Elm 
 disease.In the hedge row were red and 
 white dead nettles and foxgloves.At   
 the bottom of the field where the     
 R.Dene flows a spinney has been       
 planted by the D family and their     
 constribution to conservation.        </content>
