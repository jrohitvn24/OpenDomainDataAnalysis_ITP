 are cereals,consisting of winter      
 barley and wheat. Other crops, in     
 much smaller quantities, are oilseed  
 rape and sugar beet. The grassland is 
 used for hay or silage,with only a    
 few fields for pasture. Most of the   
 cattle are raised for meat with only  
 two dairying herds of Friesians .One  
 flock of sheep is kept in
