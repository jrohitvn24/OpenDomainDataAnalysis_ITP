		<title>01THE WALL &amp; DISTRICT AREA</title>
		<content>  The area is largely rural and        
consequently sparsely populated. There 
are no major settlements, only small   
hamlets, the village of Wall, as well  
as a number of separate farmsteads.    
However, the north east corner of the  
district includes part of Lichfield and
this provides some residential and     
industrial development.                
  Agriculture is still a major form of 
employment but many residents commute  
to nearby urban centres such as        
Lichfield and the Birmingham and Black 
Country conurbation.                   
  Wall is a tourist attraction as the  
village covers the Roman town of       
Letocetum. On view is the excavated    
bath house of a Roman posting station  
and there is also a museum. Other      
historical buildings include           
Aldershawe Hall, Manor Farm and St.    
John the Baptist's Church.             </content>
