		<content>{Ferndown}got its name mainly from the 
 heath,{Fern on the Down.}The{Post     
{Office}at Ferndown crossroads has     
 changed considerably over the years.  
 It started off as a Post Office and a 
 village store, which sold many things 
 such as coffee, cheese and spices. It 
 sells only stationery now.            
 In Victoria Road was a bungalow which 
 had a plot of land beside it, (where  
 Library Road was) but now the area has
 been converted into a car park        
 connected with the new{Tesco.}        
 The{village hall}has always been, and 
 still is, used for many activities.   
 In 1953 the Queen's Coronation was    
 televised and most people watched it  
 in the hall.                          
 The main London to Dorchester{railway 
 line ran just north of Ferndown from  
 1847 to 1966. The nearest station is  
 now in{Bournemouth.                   </content>
