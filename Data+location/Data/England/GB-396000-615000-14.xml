		<title>14PEGGY BELL'S BRIDGE</title>
		<content> The road which passes through the     
 valley only crosses the river Breamish
 once. This is across a narrow bridge  
 which is known locally as Peggy Bell's
 Bridge. The reason why it is called   
 this is believed to be because of the 
 following:                            
     When there was no bridge, the only
 way across the river was to try       
 stepping-stones or ride across on     
 horse-back. One person who did this   
 was a woman called Peggy Bell. One    
 night, she tried to cross the river   
 which was also in flood. Her horse    
 stumbled and she was thrown into the  
 water and was drowned. Such a hue-and-
 cry came out of this tragedy that work
 was begun on a bridge to cross the    
 river and this became known as Peggy  
 Bell's Bridge.
