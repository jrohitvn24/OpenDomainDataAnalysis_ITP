		<content>  In Leebotwood can be found the only  
 public house,the Pound.This started   
 life as a farmhouse in the 15th       
 Century.The farmer's wife brewed ale, 
 and drovers,on their long trek across 
 the Longmynd to markets in the south, 
 made this a regular stopping place.In 
 the 18th Century the bar was used as a
 courtroom and felons were placed in   
 the stocks in the village pound,hence 
 the name.Business grew and now the inn
 provides modern day hospitality with  
 bar snacks,meals in a small dining    
 room and accommodation on a Bed &amp;     
 Breakfast basis.                      
  The small general store began as a   
 baker's shop more than one hundred    
 years ago and there has been a Post   
 Office in the village since 1840.There
 is a large Pick Your Own fruit farm   
 and several smaller farms sell eggs,  
 fruit, plants and vegetables.         </content>
