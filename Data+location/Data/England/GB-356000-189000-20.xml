		<title>20Exploring Aust and Littleton</title>
		<content> This D-Block is a very interesting    
 area to explore. Using the centre of  
 Aust village, the Motorway Service    
 Area and Littleton as bases it is     
 possible to walk most of the land     
 area. By walking along the banks of   
 the River Severn you can see most of  
 the D-Block. However you must be      
 particulary careful when you get to   
 the Aust Interchange as it is always  
 very busy with traffic on its way to  
 and from Wales.                       
 The information about this D-Block has
 been collected by twenty-eight first  
 year pupils at Lockleaze Secondary    
 School, Bristol. Most of the          
 information has come from personal    
 observation and questions although    
 some use has been made of guidebooks.
