		<title>10NORMA'S CATTERY,MORETON</title>
		<content> Norma's Cattery is a boarding cattery 
 where people leave their cats when    
 they go on holiday,move house,go into 
 hospital or go abroad on a business   
 trip and like to know that their  cat 
 can be looked after well.The cattery  
 holds up to forty cats.Norma does all 
 the work herself,which involves       
 cleaning out the pens and feeding them
 twice a day.The average stay for cats 
 is two-three weeks,but sometimes its a
 year.Before they arrive the cats have 
 to be innoculated against cat flu and 
 enteritis.Tom cats have to be neutered
 before arriving.Each cat has its own  
 individual pen.The food is delivered  
 in bulk but some owners bring their   
 own food.Norma breeds Persian cats    
 from her own stock of 14.Norma also   
 keeps dogs,chickens,ducks,geese,sheep,
 goats and a horse, as pets.
