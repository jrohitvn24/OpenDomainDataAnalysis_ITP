		<title>09SOCIAL CONCERNS IN CODICOTE</title>
		<content> There was much village controversy at 
 the proposed sale by the County       
 Council of the old school property to 
 a private developer, because behind   
 the attractive Victorian building was 
 a fine playing field. This was felt to
 be public property and therefore this 
 should have been retained as a village
 amenity to be used as a playing area. 
  After losing an appeal the villagers 
 continued to fight the developers'    
 plan to build 80 houses on the site,  
 which was considered gross over-      
 crowding. This time they were         
 partially successful as development   
 was limited to 45 houses and a taste- 
 ful modification of the school house  
 into 6 homes.                         
  Many villagers still regret the loss 
 of a fine old public building to the  
 developers.
