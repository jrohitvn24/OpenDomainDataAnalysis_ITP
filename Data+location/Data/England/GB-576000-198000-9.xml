		<content> The parish church of St Mary the      
 Virgin dates from the Norman conquest.
 The Rector who lives in the village,  
 conducts Sunday services and also     
 takes Communion to sick and elderly   
 folk as needed. Its picturesque       
 appearance and setting make it a      
 popular choice for village weddings   
 and christening and for those from the
 nearby new town. Traditionally too,   
 local residents' funerals are held    
 here followed by interment in the     
 churchyard or, increasingly, cremation
 in Chelmsford. The congregational     
 church (The Chapel) serves those who  
 prefer free church forms of worship.  
 Two Sunday services and Sunday school 
 for children are held each week with  
 additional meetings for children,     
 women and bible study. Sick and       
 elderly villagers receive gifts from  
 the Communion fund at harvest time.   </content>
