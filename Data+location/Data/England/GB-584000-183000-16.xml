		<title>16St. Clements Church Tower</title>
		<content> The church tower is the highest point 
 in this area. It is built of Kentish  
 ragstone and flint. It is 80 foot     
 high. The 99 steps are steep and      
 narrow and keep on winding until you  
 feel dizzy. We stopped on the 56th    
 step to see where they rang the bells.
 There are six bells and twenty        
 bellringers and the youngest is aged  
 ten. Every Wednesday they practise    
 from 7-9pm. We all had a go on the    
 treble bell. It was difficult and once
 I went right up in the air. After we  
 had looked at the bells which were    
 huge, we carried on to the top of the 
 tower. From the top we could see lots 
 of things, the sea, some boats, many  
 houses and even the pier.
