		<title>10CHANGE IN BURNT HEATH</title>
		<content>    We interviewed a resident of{Burnt 
{Heath,}a street of 17 houses, to hear 
 about the differences between living  
 there now and 30 years ago.The houses 
 had{no taps}or{mains water,}so water  
 was fetched in buckets from a well.   
 There were{no inside lavatories,}only 
 earth closets at the bottom of the    
 gardens.                              
    Thirty years ago the fields were   
 smaller,there were no more hedges     
 than there are now and crops were     
 grown to feed the working{farm horses.
{  }At that time, living in the street 
 was a thatcher,a postman,a porter,a   
 nursery worker and a builder; now     
 there is  a gardener,a factory        
 worker,a builder,a shop assistant,an  
 electrician and a nurse.              
    Life is more comfortable now !.
