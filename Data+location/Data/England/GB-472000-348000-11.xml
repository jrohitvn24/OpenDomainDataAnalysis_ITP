		<title>11RIVER MANAGEMENT</title>
		<content> The{River Trent}is managed and        
 financed in a variety of ways.  There 
 is no charge for craft passing through
 the lock, but the money is recouped by
{British Waterways Board}from the boat 
 licence fee which varies according to 
 the size of the craft.  Although{     
{British Waterways}are responsible for 
 the maintenance of the river bed,     
 banks and lock, the{Severn-Trent Water
{Authority}own the water. The fishing  
 rights are currently leased to {      
{Nottingham Piscatorial Society}, but  
 this system of leasing is now under   
 review, and a more direct system of   
 renting the fishing rights to         
 individuals is being considered by the
{British Waterways Board.
