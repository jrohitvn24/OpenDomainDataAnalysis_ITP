		<title>12Older Housing. ELLESMERE</title>
		<content> Most of Ellesmere's large beautiful   
 past houses are falling to bits.      
 Stanham is a Regency Gothic Villa of  
 around 1820. The Hollies, still lived 
 in by a crippled lady, is near the    
 town centre, but a new road might     
 destroy it. Tudor Cottage, in good    
 condition, is probably the oldest     
 house on the South West part of town  
 and is one of the only brick and      
 timber houses left in town. The       
 cottages along Wharf Road have been   
 changed dramatically, with new        
 windows, square instead of a kind of  
 pentagon. They were origonally for the
 Dairy workers (formely an iron        
 foundary). Once they were small, now  
 they are quite a good size. Railway   
 Terrace was built for the raliway     
 workers. The railway was behind them. 
 The small cottages were extremely     
 small, and conditions were bad.       </content>
