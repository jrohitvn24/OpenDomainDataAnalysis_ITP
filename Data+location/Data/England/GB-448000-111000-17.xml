		<title>17BOTLEY FLOUR MILLS</title>
		<content> Botley Flour Mills were mentioned in  
 the first Domesday Book:"2 mills worth
 20 shillings".Amongst the owners have 
 been the Earl of Southampton and the  
 Duke of Portland.                     
 In 1921 the Botley Flour Milling Co.  
 was formed and came under the control 
 of the Appleby family who still own it
 today.The policy of the mill is to    
 keep up to date with milling          
 techniques and they have just         
 opened a new animal feed mill with    
 micro_processor controls.Only one     
 person is needed to operate the whole 
 mill.Water power can still be used to 
 make Stoneground Wholemeal flour but  
 most work is done by electricity.Many 
 specialised grades of flour are       
 produced to suit customers' individual
 needs.
