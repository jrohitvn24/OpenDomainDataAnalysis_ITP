		<content>{Fenstanton,}set on the old Roman road 
 (A6O4),has a population of 2,500.The  
 village goes back before Domesday when
 it had a population of 32.In those    
 days it was owned by the Bishop of    
 Rochester.After Domesday it was owned 
 by Gilbert of Gaunt,a nephew of       
 William the Conquerer.                
    {The oldest part of the village is 
{Honey Hill;}the church and the clock  
 tower are nearly as old.{The church   
{spire}has been a village landmark for 
 over 600 years.{The clocktower}in the 
 High Street has a bell that was put   
 there in  1660,that makes it over 300 
 years old.                            
    {Today Fenstanton is a busy village
 and has lots of shops and buildings   
 including Post Office,Nursery,Frock   
 Exchange,Baker's,Butcher's etc.       
     I think Fenstanton has a stable   
 future and will flourish ever more.   </content>
