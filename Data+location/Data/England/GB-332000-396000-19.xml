		<content> Our school has got a computer room.A  
 lot of my friends have got their own  
 "home computer" but mainly use it to  
 play games.My favourite lessons are   
 computer studies,science,games,art,   
 woodwork and YM (yearmaster period).  
 In YM we play games like football,    
 non-stop cricket,battleships,bingo,   
 chess or we have quizzes like         
 blockbusters.                         
 We start school at 8:50am and have    
 eight,35 minute lessons each day.     
 Morning break lasts 20 minutes and is 
 followed by a 20 minute assembly.     
 Our school uniform is composed of grey
 or black trousers, a white or grey    
 shirt,black or dark shoes,a blue tie  
 and a blue blazer with the school     
 badge on it.Dinner break lasts 45     
 minutes and school ends at 3:20pm.    
 The best school meal is sausage,chips 
 and beans with apple pie and custard. </content>
