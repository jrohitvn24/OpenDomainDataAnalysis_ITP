		<title>15THE QUARRY</title>
		<content>   The Quarry was originally a         
sandstone quarry working in 1786. The  
church and school were built from stone
quarried here. It became a dump after  
all the stone was taken out. Water     
collected in the pit and trees and     
wildlife had grown up around.          
  There was a little workshop there    
which made ladders, then it became a   
cycle and motorbike repair shop. When  
it closed down all of the stuff was    
dumped in the Quarry. The site was     
owned by the Scotney Estate, but in    
1977 (Jubilee year) a management       
committee cleared the trees to make    
open space and removed the rubbish from
the pond.                              
  Many fish live in the pond and now   
there is an angling club.              
  The open spaces now serve as a picnic
area for visitors.
