		<title>15A SCHOOLTEACHER'S DAY (CONT)</title>
		<content> Aircraft at some tremendous speed     
 twist, turn, interweave with each     
 other and dive through the sky. They  
 pass within inches of each other, then
 head high and fast into the distance. 
 You turn, and an aeroplane sweeps low 
 across the school, while the children 
 scream with a mixture of fear and     
 delight. They race from one end of the
 playground to the other in excitement.
 The aircraft team stages a mock attack
 on the airfield. It may just as well  
 have been on the playground, we are so
 near. For 20 minutes the sky is filled
 with movement and artistry, then all  
 is quiet. The afternoon seemed quite  
 an anti-climax, it brought us all     
 literally down to earth. School closes
 at 3.30. I make a mental note to try  
 to be out of school and across the    
 main road before 4.30 when the crowds 
 from British Aerospace disperse.      </content>
