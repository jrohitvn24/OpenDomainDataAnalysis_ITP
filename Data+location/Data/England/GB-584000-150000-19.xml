		<title>19WHY WE CAME TO BRITAIN</title>
		<content> We came to this country unexpectedly  
 from the beautiful country of Uganda. 
 We came from a small town called Tinta
 which  is situated on the bank of     
 river Nile near Lake Victoria. My     
 grandad came from India  in 1922 and  
 all but two of his family were born   
 in Uganda.                            
 Uganda was first ruled by the British 
 and became independent in 1962. It was
 then ruled by a Kabaka or African     
 king. When he died President Oboto    
 ruled. He was overthrown by Amin and  
 the army. My dad had his own business 
 and bungalow but Amin told all British
 Asians to leave Uganda so we came here
 with nothing in October,1962. We were 
 taken to West Malling and given food  
 and clothing. The British people have 
 helped us a lot and now we have a     
 council house at Harrietsham.
