		<title>05Trade In Bawdeswell</title>
		<content> Tradesmen include the following;      
 builder, butcher, garage, hairdresser,
 general stores, post office and farm &amp;
 garden machinery. The Old Rectory has 
 been converted into a restaurant,     
 specialising in Victorian menus. House
 to house deliveries are made of mail, 
 papers, milk, fish, bread and coal.   
 The main stream of traffic on the     
 A1067 now by-passes Bawdeswell, but   
 there are daily buses to Norwich and  
 Fakenham, and a weekly one to the     
 nearest market town of East Dereham,  
 mainly used by shoppers attracted by  
 the cheaper prices of the             
 supermarkets. Refuse is collected     
 weekly by County Council vehicles.    
 There is a public telephone box in the
 village although many houses have     
 telephones. The Doctor's surgery is at
 N. Elmham, 7 miles away, but there is 
 a cemetary in the village!            </content>
