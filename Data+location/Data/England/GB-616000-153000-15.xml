		<title>15ROADS OLD AND NEW  BRIDGE</title>
		<content> The newest road near Bridge is the    
 Canterbury By_pass.It was built in    
{1983}it is a dual carriageway and it  
 joins onto Bridge By_pass.The oldest  
 road is the Roman road,it leads from  
 Canterbury through Bridge to          
 Dover.Before Bridge By_pass was built 
 all traffic came through Bridge.We    
 found out how much traffic uses the   
 By_pass now.We counted for{10}minutes 
 every hour.The average number of      
 vehicles going to Dover was{137.}The  
 average number of vehicles going to   
 Canterbury in ten minutes was{156.}   
 I found out how the children of Bridge
 school travel to school.{72 }come in  
 cars,{51}walk,{41}come on either the  
 Bekesbourne or Bishopsbourne bus,and{ 
{16}come by bicycle.Children have to   
 pass their Cycling Proficiency before 
 being allowed to ride to school.
