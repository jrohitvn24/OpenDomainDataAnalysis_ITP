 with a set of drags drawn by the two  
 horses. By the time we had finished it
 was getting quite late and we were all
 feeling very tired. We all went back  
 to the farm and had some tea before I 
 milked the cows.I gave the horses a   
 good grooming and took them out into  
 the field. It was now time to leave   
 work, so I went indoors and had my    
 supper of bread, cheese and a pint of 
 cider, then to bed to get ready for   
 the next day.
