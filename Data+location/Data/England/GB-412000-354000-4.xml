     {The Tissington Trail} runs for   
about one and a half kilometres        
through our Domesday block of          
Alstonefield.  It is used by walkers   
and cyclists alike. People can hire    
cycles at different places along the   
trail and leave them at a different    
place further along when they leave    
the trail.  The trail was once a       
railway line before it was used by     
walkers and cyclists.                  
                                       
     {The Dove Dale Walk} is in Dove   
Dale.  You can walk from Beresford     
Dale through Mill Dale into Dove Dale. 
Dove Dale is a tourist attraction.     
People come from many places to visit  
Dove Dale and to walk along this       
beautiful walk down in the Dove Valley.
