		<title>02POPULATION TRENDS GLENFIELD</title>
		<content> In{1086, there were 12 families}living
 in Glenfield. All would have been born
 here, except the priest. By the{1851  
 census,after the railway had been here
 19 years,there were{544 people,}1 in 8
 were born outside Leicestershire. 70  
 years ago, people in Glenfield rarely 
 visited Leicester,4 miles away. A 1985
 school survey shows that, of 266      
 parents, 2 in 5 were born outside the 
 county. People come to Glenfield      
 because it is a pleasant place to live
 conveniently near to the countryside &amp;
 the City of Leicester which provides  
 employment,shopping and other services
 and enjoys good communications.Instead
 of being a self-contained community,as
 it was within the lifetime of the     
 elderly villagers, mobility has made  
 Glenfield almost a suburb of Leicester
 with{an estimated population of 8855. 
 This growth is still going on.        </content>
