		<title>02BRIDGE STREET</title>
		<content>{Bridge Street}is very noisy and busy. 
 It seems a very squashed street.      
 Most of the people seem to be old in  
 Bridge Street but they haven't lived  
 there long.   There are two pubs      
 called the{Riverside Inn}and the{Soar 
{Bridge Inn}and there is a garage      
 called{Riverside Cars.  }There is only
 one shop in Bridge Street which is a  
 lady's hairdresser's.   There is a    
 cottage called Falstaff and some parts
 are over 400 years old.   There is    
 also a cottage called Clock Cottage.  
 It has a clock in every window and a  
 clock on the ouside of the house.     
 Bridge Stteet used to be called{Briggs
