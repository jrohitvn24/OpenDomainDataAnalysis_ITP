		<content>    In terms of appearance our D-Block 
 is rural in character and partially   
 covered in woodland (25%), including  
 part of Haugh Wood and Bear's Wood.   
    Mordiford is a small nucleated     
 settlement enjoying a close and       
 friendly atmosphere. The overall      
 impression is of a settlement that    
 blends in well with its natural       
 surroundings.                         
    The River Lugg flows N-S through   
 the West side of the D-Block. On its  
 course it flows near Hampton Meadow   
 and through Longworth and Mordiford.  
    As Hereford is famous for its cider
 one would expect there to be a number 
 of orchards in our D-Block and indeed 
 these include a very large cider apple
 producing unit at Prospect Farm.
