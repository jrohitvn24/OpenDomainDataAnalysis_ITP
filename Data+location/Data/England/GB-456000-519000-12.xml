		<title>12CHURCH AND THE PEOPLE</title>
		<content> Nearly everone believes in God.Only   
 one or two don't.The majority go to   
 church on special occasions.Only a few
 go once a week or just once a month.A 
 few don't go at all.More people think 
 that we aren't a religous minded      
 country than people who think we are.A
 few people said that we were split    
 down the middle.There are only two    
 places of worship,one at Wilton and   
 one at Kirkleatham.There are none at  
 Lazenby,which is the most populated   
 area.Most of the people are Church of 
 England,attending,if they do          
 attend,one or other of the local      
 churches.In 1983 the first marriage   
 took place in the Almshouses private  
 chapel.It was built in 1742.Permission
 for the wedding had to be obtained    
 from the Archbishop of Canterbury.
