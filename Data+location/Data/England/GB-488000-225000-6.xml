		<content> One or two small specialised shops    
 have opened in the Leighton/ Linslade 
 areas as one might have expected in   
 this out of town location. There is a 
 picture framing buisiness and an      
 animal food shop with small pets      
 for sale. Two antique/bric-a-brac     
 shops stand almost opposite one       
 another, one specialising in the very 
 popular current trend for stripped    
 pine furniture.                       
 Estate agents are new-comers to this  
 area but seem to be establishing      
 healthy trade out of town. There are  
 several ladies hairdressers and a     
 barber obviously drawn by high density
 of population and low rents and rates.
 There is a smart restaurent called    
 "Axtell's" at which the French style  
 cooking costs around Â£8.00 to Â£9.00   
 for a main course.
