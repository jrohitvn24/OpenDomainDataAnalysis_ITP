		<title>05THE COUNTRYSIDE - CALNE</title>
		<content> I like living in Calne, because it is 
 a nice place . You can go on long     
 walks in the countryside. I like      
 walking in the woods and along the    
 river and up the sandpits because I   
 like seeing the birds and animals.On  
 Saturdays my Dad and I go for long    
 walks to Compton Bassett. We went up  
 the lane and saw a greenfinch.We went 
 through some fields and saw some      
 long-tailed tits and wrens.We went    
 along the lane and through more fields
 until we saw a pit with lots of rabbit
 holes and rabbits were everywhere. We 
 heard a bird but did not know what it 
 was until it came out, it was a wood  
 warbler. We found a pond with         
 primroses around it and I let my frogs
 go there.We saw some swallows and a   
 moorhen fly across the pool.We had to 
 crawl under some barbed wire and a    
 partridge flew out of the hedge.      </content>
