		<content>  Scalford Youth Club was built in     
 1978. Some of the money was raised by 
 the people of Scalford and some given 
 by the County Council. The building is
 used for many things, like meetings of
 the{Youth Club,}badminton, Bingo and  
 the village auction which is held once
 a year. People can book the hall for  
 wedding receptions and parties.       
  {The Scalford Badminton Club}has two 
 sections, a junior class and a senior 
 class. There is an official team which
 is in the Melton League and is doing  
 quite well. Also in the village there 
 is a{Women's Institute}holding monthly
 meetings and a{British Legion}group.  
     Other clubs in Scalford include   
{The Friends of Scalford School,}a{Keep
{Fit}group and a{Playgroup}for young   
 children. There are no clubs or       
 societies in any of the other villages
 in our area.                          </content>
