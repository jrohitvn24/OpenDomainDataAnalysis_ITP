		<content> It was decided to do a survey of      
 visitors to Eyam. Two children asked  
 five questions of visiting people.    
 They did this on different days of the
 week and times of the day             
 They found that the day of the week   
 didn't have any influence but the     
 weather did.It appeared that more     
 people came in the middle of the day  
 than early morning or late            
 afternoon.The village is very         
 popular with school parties but it    
 was decided not to interview any of   
 these.                                
 The survey asked five questions       
 These were---
