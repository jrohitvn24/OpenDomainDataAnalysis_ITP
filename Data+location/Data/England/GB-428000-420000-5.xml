		<content> One day the BBC came to see my Grandpa
 Lindley they said they would like     
 to make a television programme about  
 his garden. The programme was called  
 Gardeners World. My grandpa was very  
 pleased he said it would be alright.  
 When they stared filming my nanna went
 in a big van and watched it being     
 recorded. The BBC  people brought lots
 of cameras and lights. Before the     
 programme was made my grandpa  did    
 a lot of work in the garden. The      
 programme was on Friday 5th Sept      
 the time was 8.35. We all went down to
 my nanna's to watch it on the         
 television it was very exciting to see
 my grandpa talking and telling them   
 about his garden.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
