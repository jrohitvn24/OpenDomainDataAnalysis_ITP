		<content>   The 18th century farmhouse was once 
 the Earl of Westmoreland's hunting    
 lodge. It is a fruit and arable farm  
 covering{185}acres,with 100 acres of  
 wheat,13 of strawberries,25 of apples 
 and 1 of blackberries. There are only 
{2}full time workers and{1}part time   
 worker who is self employed. During   
 seasonal picking times about{25}casual
 workers are employed.                 
   The present owners have lived there 
 20 years and work on a{land rotation  
{plan}that always looks {5 years ahead.
 They have established a"Pick Your Own"
 aspect to the farm so that the public 
 can gather fruit in the appropriate   
 seasons. In an effort to bring a      
 greater understanding of farming to   
 the general public farmers are being  
 encouraged to open their farms.Keen to
 nurture this idea, a{farm trail and   
{pet area}has been created, see page 3.</content>
