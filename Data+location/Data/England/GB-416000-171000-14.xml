		<content>{ Rockley}is a tiny village owned by   
 the Manor and has changed very little.
 Only one new building, a corn drier,  
 has been built, although the old      
 school closed in 1947 is now an       
 antique shop and the church which     
 closed in 1961 is now a restaurant.   
 There are half the inhabitants now,   
 less than fifty, for families are     
 smaller and younger people have moved 
 away.                                 
  A bus used to call at the village,   
 but there is no public transport      
 today.Although there is no village    
 life, no shop, pub, school or church, 
 the inhabitants enjoy the peaceful    
 country life, watching woodpeckers and
 nuthatches surrounded by the empty    
 downs.
