		<content>    So far people are happy with the   
 present government, although teachers 
 are striking because they feel they   
 are not being paid enough.  Due to    
 the strike, O'level pupils are        
 suffering.  Parents are complaining to
 the Council although they cannot      
 really do anything.  It is the Burnham
 Committee, who decides the pay.       
{HEALTH AND ACCIDENTS                  
    At Fairthorne Manor the few        
 accidents they do have mostly happen  
 on the assault course.                
    In serious accidents the patient is
 taken to Southampton General Hospital,
 which is one of the nearest hospitals,
 the other being Queen Alexandra       
 Hospital.                             
    There are no disabled people in    
 this area.  The few accidents that do 
 occur are mainly young girls falling  
 off horses and accidents on the farm. </content>
