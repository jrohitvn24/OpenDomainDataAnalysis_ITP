		<content> The quality of{housing}in{Wickford}   
 isn't spectacular,the houses have been
 made at speed when they were needed.  
 The houses are mainly three or four   
 bedroomed and semi-detached.The recent
 housing like The Wick have been made  
 mainly for first time buyers,because  
 they are two bedroomed.These are being
 made to satisfy the growing population
 .Houses have been knocked down in     
 places and infilling has taken place. 
 The houses in{Wickford}aren't         
 extremely poor,but it could be better.
 My house is semi-detatched and made of
 bricks,it is about 17 years old and I 
 have lived there for 15 years.        
 My garden is about 20ft.long.The      
 inside is made up of a kitchen,dining 
 room,living room,hall and toilet.     
 Upstairs there are 4 bedrooms and a   
 bathroom.
