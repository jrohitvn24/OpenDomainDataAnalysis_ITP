		<title>10CONCLUSION,SOUTH FEN/TWENTY</title>
		<content>    In this small{area of South Lincoln
{shire}which is almost exclusively down
 to{farmland,}it is very difficilt to  
 define any given amenities or items of
 special interest.  However,life on the
{fenlands}is{typical of the area;}only 
 the scrapyard seems out of character. 
    The{study}of the area has been     
{undertaken by}the children in{Class 4L
 at{Bourne County Primary School}with  
 their class teacher, Mr.J.H.Lambert   
 and the headmaster, Mr.R.N.Wright.    
    The following children have taken a
 special interest; Emma Johns, Andrew  
 Pateman, Karen Dawson, Rachel Anning, 
 James Hart and Christopher Warwick.   
    Much of the background information 
 came from Emma's uncle who lives in   
 Tongue End.                           
    Our{thanks}are due to the haulage, 
 foundry/scrapyard{owners and farmers }
 for their help and co-operation.      </content>
