		<title>13Sheep Farming</title>
		<content> The farm at Cockles Green is called   
 Field Farm. It has sheep, dogs and    
 horses. The owner is Mr Oram who lives
 in the farm. He feeds the sheep, cuts 
 the corn, wheatand barley with Mr     
 Oram's combine-harvester and, when    
 they have finished, they put all the  
 different grains into big bins until  
 they sell them to make different kinds
 of food, like Weetabix, for instance. 
 They keep the left-overs, that is the 
 straw bits on the field so, when the  
 bailer comes along, it turns them into
 round bails as quickly as anything.   
   If the by-pass goes through Mr      
 Oram's land it will be cut in half,   
 so, to get his sheep over to the other
 side of the road, they'll have a      
 little bridge across the by-pass.
