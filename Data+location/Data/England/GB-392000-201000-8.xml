		<title>08  FARMING</title>
		<content>  Most of the farms in our area are    
 arable farms. One farmer kept a herd  
 of dairy cows but said that his farm  
 was too small to be really called a   
 Dairy Farm.However,every farmer       
 kept some animals, including cows.Most
 of the farms are worked by tenant     
 farmers, which means they have to pay 
 rent, but some of the farms have been 
 in the same family for a very long    
 time. Every farmer  employed some     
 labour to help to run the farm.The    
 main crops grown are spring and winter
 wheat, barley, oilseed rape, oats,    
 grass for hay and grass for seed. Some
 land is used for grazing. The Dairy   
 farmer sold his milk to be made into  
 butter. Every farmer owned at least   
 one tractor and baler, and some other 
 farm machinery.
