		<content>One doctor holds a surgery at a house  
in Gislingham a few times each week.   
Other doctors are at Eye or Botesdale  
Health Centres (4 miles). The nearest  
hospital is at Eye but only for        
maternity or geriatric care. Patients  
needing hospital treatment must go to  
Ipswich (23 miles), Norwich (25 miles),
or Bury St.Edmunds (20 miles).         
Health care for children includes a    
monthly clinic held in the Village     
Hall, home visits by a Health Visitor, 
immunisation against various diseases, 
and medical examinations held at school
including hearing and eye tests. Most  
parents arrange dental treatment with a
family dentist owing to the infrequency
of  visits by the Schools' Dental      
Officer. A District Nurse visits the   
infirm elderly regularly.
