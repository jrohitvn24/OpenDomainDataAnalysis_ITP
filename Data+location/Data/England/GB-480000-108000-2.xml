		<title>02   OLD BREEDS OF SHEEP</title>
		<content>   These are kept by Reverend Johnson, 
 the vicar of Funtington and West      
 Stoke. He has a{Dorset Horn}ram in the
 grounds of West Stoke Church and 8 {  
{Southdown }ewes and 2 lambs in the    
 graveyard and paddock of Funtington   
 Church and Vicarage. Southdown        
 sheep are a small, compact breed      
 weighing about 54.5kg. when fully     
 grown. They roamed the South Downs    
 200 years ago.                        
   They graze the grass in the summer  
 and are fed oats and hay during the   
 winter.                               
   They are shorn in the early summer. 
 Southdown fleeces are very white.     
 They weigh about 1.36 kg. and have to 
 be sold to the {Wool Marketing Board.}
