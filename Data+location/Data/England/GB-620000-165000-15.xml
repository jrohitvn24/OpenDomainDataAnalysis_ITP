		<title>15LOCAL HISTORY 1</title>
		<content> The Boyden Gate and Highstead areas   
 are rich in traces of pre-history,and 
 local people keep a look out for them 
{Palaeolithic}remains have often been  
 found by workers in the local gravel  
 pits.The finds are worked flints used 
 by early man and the bones of long    
 extinct animals such as{Mammoths}who  
 lived here before the last Ice Age.   
 Relics of later period are also found.
 Men ploughing and working on drainage 
 ditches in the valleys often see      
{Roman}and Medieval pottery brought to 
 the surface by their machines.A number
 of local people have small collections
 of ancient coins that they have found 
 digging their gardens and small       
 holdings.The{Monks}had Vineyards here 
 before the Reformation. But no trace  
 of them remains. From the air signs of
 the 40 salt pans mentioned in Domesday
 Book can still be seen.               </content>
