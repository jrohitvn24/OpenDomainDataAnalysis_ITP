  St.Michels (our school) is a group 4 
 Church of England Primary School      
 (aided) of about 250 pupils from 5-11 
 years of age.With 7 teachers and a    
 Headmistress it is one of the larger  
 primary schools in the area.          
  Many of our pupils will transfer at  
 eleven years to Carr Hill High School 
 ,(the only comprehensive school       
 nearby).About eight children from     
 forty five leavers in 1985 will go to 
 independent schools - mainly Kirkham  
 Grammar School.Secondary education    
 will end for many at 16 years ,others 
 will stay on for extra years and then 
 go on further education.              
  At the moment school leavers are     
 having difficulty finding employment  
 and the government are providing      
 schemes of industrial and commercial  
 training.                             </content>
