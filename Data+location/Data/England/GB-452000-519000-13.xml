		<content> The area can be divided into three    
 different ages for housing,the oldest 
 being pre 1914.the middle group       
 belonging to the inter war period i.e 
 1918-1939,and the newest being post   
 war.The oldest group is composed      
 mainly of terraced housing with no    
 gardens and a rear yard to the        
 property,there are some more          
 substantial houses from the same      
 period.The{terraced houses}were for   
 the workers in the local{steel works  
 and the larger properties for the     
 managers.Many of the original terraced
 housing has been demolished,those     
 remaining have been given a new lease 
 of life,by a{modernisation}programme  
 undertaken by the council.Inter war   
 year housing is mainl{semi-detached   
 brick built with slate roofing.Post   
 war housing is most prominent and is  
 mainly council built.                 </content>
