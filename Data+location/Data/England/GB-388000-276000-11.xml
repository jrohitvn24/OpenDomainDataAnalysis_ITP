		<title>11Unemployment</title>
		<content> Unemployment in the Kidderminster area
 has shown a small improvement of 130  
 during the last month. The latest Job 
 Centre figures for June 1985 show that
 5517 people are still without a job   
 (15.2% of the area's working          
 population). This compares with 16%   
 for Birmingham and 11.5% for          
 Worcester. The improvement is probably
 only seasonal and the prospects are   
 not good. The area relied heavily on  
 the{carpet industry}which has been    
 severely cut back.{ Farming}has become
 more mechanised, resulting in more job
 losses from the land.                 
 People who are unemployed receive a   
 certain amount of money each week     
 known as 'the dole' (Unemployment     
 Benefit) from the state. People who   
 have retired also receive a weekly sum
 of money (pension).
