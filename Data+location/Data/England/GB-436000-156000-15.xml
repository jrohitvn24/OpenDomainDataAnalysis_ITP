		<content> In Linkenholt and Faccombe small      
 village school buildings still exist  
 but are now used as estate offices.   
 Children under 11 years of age living 
 in Faccombe attend Hurstbourne Tarrant
 School while those from Linkenholt    
 attend Vernham Dean School. From age  
 11 to 16 the majority attend John     
 Hanson Comprehensive School in Andover
 and those wishing to continue their   
 education after 16 attend Cricklade   
 college, Andover. These schools and   
 college come under the Education Dept.
 of Hampshire County Council to provide
 free education for boys and girls in  
 mixed classes. A few children attend  
 fee-paying and boarding schools.      
 As the villages are situated more than
 2 miles from any school, the children 
 at state schools are provided with    
 free transport. School meals are      
 provided in the middle of the day.    </content>
