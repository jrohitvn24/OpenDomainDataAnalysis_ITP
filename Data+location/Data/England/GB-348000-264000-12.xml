		<content> I would recommend{Moreton, Eye and    
{Ashton}for{birdlife.}We have water    
 birds in this area because there are  
 lots of lakes and ponds. We have a    
 wide variety of rare birds like       
{buzzards and herons.}There are of     
 course also many common birds.        
 The area is rich in wildlife because  
 we are in a rural area.{Deer and      
{badgers}have been sighted in this     
 area. There are also good places for  
 fishing. Since the hedgerows and      
 verges are not cut so frequently there
 is an abundance of{wild flowers.}Some 
 of the{hedges}in our area are over 600
 years old!                            
 This area is very peaceful and        
 beautiful with its trees, fields and  
 hills.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
