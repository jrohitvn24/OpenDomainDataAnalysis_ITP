		<content>   The{students}at Harper Adams College
 get a lot of entertainment. This      
 includes bands, karate club, ballroom 
 dancing, rugby, football, parachuting,
 and maybe squash in a few years time. 
 There is also a swimming pool and two 
 tennis courts on the college grounds. 
 About three quarters of the students  
 have cars and so a lot of parking     
 space is needed. Altogether there are 
 710 students, 240 of whom live in at  
 the college. Most of the students who 
 live out stay in rented cottages.     
 There are about a quarter girls to    
 three quarters boys at college. A     
 library is also in the college grounds
 and the students can obtain a vast    
 number of different books mostly to do
 with farming.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
