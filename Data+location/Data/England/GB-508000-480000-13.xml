		<title>13Housing in Filey.</title>
		<content> In the 17 century fishing cottages    
 were built they were made of stone and
 painted white.They still stand today  
 near the museum on Queen Street Filey.
 In the late 1960's a new estate was   
 built it was called Wharfedale.Before 
 the estate was built it was fields and
 woodlands.                            
 In the 1960's new homes were built by 
 a company called Ideal Homes.They     
 built a big estate near the church,St.
 Oswalds,which was built in the 12th   
 century.                              
 Recently this year builders moved into
 an old derelict playschool they       
 knocked it down and built flats for   
 old people.
