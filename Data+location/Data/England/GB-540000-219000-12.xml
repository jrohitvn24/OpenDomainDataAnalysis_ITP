   Carldane Court was inherited by Hugh
 Crammoth, Crallon's son, and he held  
 it until 1953. He too was an architect
 and he developed the house even more, 
 building the new wing, so extending   
 it to almost three times its original 
 size.When he retired he sold the house
 to Patrick Dollan who bought it with  
 about 53 acres. Mr. Dollan altered the
 house quite considerably. He extended 
 the garden and bought land from the   
 Lordship Estate. The farm now extends 
 to 435 acres, 401 acres of which are  
 under arable cropping and the rest is 
 woodland. In 1977 a Dutchman Mr.Van   
 Englan bought the house and farm.He   
 has a farm manager, Mr.Peter Glogner, 
 who manages the estate for him as he  
 only uses the house as a holiday home 
 and so is out of the country for a lot
 of the time.                          </content>
