		<content>   The Grantham suburb of New Somerby  
 houses local residents, some of whom  
 work near by  in the town's largest   
 factory,Aveling Barford,producing     
 earth moving machinery.At the top of  
 Somerby Hill is the large national    
 Territorial Army depot,housed in the  
 Prince William of Gloucester          
 Barracks.The flat heathland           
 thereabouts was a grass airfield in   
 World War One and continued as a      
 training area until the 1970s.It has  
 now reverted to farmland.Most of the  
 area surveyed is farmland, mainly     
 arable.Across the easten half of the  
 area runs the Roman road Ermine       
 St,locally known as the High Dyke.The 
 regularly spaced houses, about 250    
 metres apart, along Turnor Rd were    
 built as smallholdings between the 1st
 and 2nd World Wars but are no longer  
 used as farms.                        </content>
