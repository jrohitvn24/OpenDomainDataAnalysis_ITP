		<title>14Beating Day.</title>
		<content>   Dad's a gamekeeper and on beating   
 day morning all the farmers come to my
 house for a cup of tea bringing their 
 vans and dogs with them. First we go  
 to Rosemary Steel's farm where we put 
 on our boots before setting off over  
 fields through puddles of mud. Finally
 we come to the wood and all the beat- 
 ers find a stick to beat the bushes.  
 The shooters load their guns alert for
 the odd pheasant,woodcock,rabbit or   
 hare. Suddenly there's a big panic and
 the men all fire at the same time and 
 kill the birds. Then they let their   
 dogs off the leads to retrieve the    
 birds.                                
   The game is taken back to my        
 house to be hung in the game larder to
 keep fresh.Dad later processes it re- 
 moving fur and feathers while my Nan  
 and Uncle prepare them for the super- 
 market.                               </content>
