		<title>07JUNIOR SCHOOL, SOUTHWELL (1)</title>
		<content>  Lowes Wong Junior{School}was founded 
 in 1967. The Headmaster,Mr.T.Bowler is
 the second to be appointed. The School
 for boys and girls from the age of    
 seven to eleven. It was built because 
 the{population}of Southwell grew,and  
 so the need for more premises became  
 more urgent.                          
  The name "Lowes Wong" requires some  
 explanation. The word "Wong" is a of  
 Scandinavian origin and is a common   
 element in{Nottinghanshire's}field    
 names, referring to a piece of        
 unenclosed meadow land.The Lowe family
 leased Dunham Prebend for about one   
 hundred and years and the adjoining   
 wong was let with the house.Tht major 
 part of the wong now comprises of the 
 school grounds.                       
  There are three hundred and eighty   
 three children, about half boys and   
 girls.                                </content>
