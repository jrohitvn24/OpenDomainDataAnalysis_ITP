		<title>12THE CROSSENS PUMPING STATION</title>
		<content>THE PUMPING STATION AT CROSSENS WAS    
FOUNDED BY THOMAS FLEETWOOD OF BANKS.  
HE BUILT IT IN 1843 AND IT WAS LATER   
EXTENDED.IT NOW COVERS A VAST AREA AND 
WAS OPENED IN 1961 BY H.R.H.PRINCESS   
ALEXANDRA.                             
 THERE ARE TWO PUMPS IN NEARBY RUFFORD 
AND IN HOLMESWOOD AND KEW.THEY PUMP TWO
MILLION TONS OF WATER A DAY.THE STATION
HAS ITS OWN GENERATOR IN CASE THERE IS 
A POWER CUT. THERE ARE SEVEN ENGINES.  
 IT IS OWNED BY THE LANCASHIRE RIVER   
BOARD.IN THE EXCAVATION OF THE NEW     
PUMPING STATION A HUGE BOULDER WAS     
FOUND FIVE METRES BELOW THE SURFACE.   
SCIENTISTS KNOW THAT THE ONLY PLACE    
WHERE THIS TYPE OF ROCK IS NATIVE IS   
IN DUMFRIES SO OUR BOULDER MUST HAVE   
COME FROM A GLACIER DURING THE ICE AGE.
 THE WORK OF THE STATION IS IMPORTANT  
AS OUR AREA HAS A LOT OF MARSHLAND AND 
GOOD DRAINAGE IS ESSENTIAL.            </content>
