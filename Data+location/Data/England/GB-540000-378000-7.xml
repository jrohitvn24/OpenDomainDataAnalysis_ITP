		<title>07Population - Social Classes</title>
		<content> Class distinction has now almost      
 disappeared. People being judged more 
 for abilities than heritage. The      
 general populous are now independent  
 of landowners, many owning plots of   
 land on which modern bungelows &amp;      
 houses have been erected. Many old    
 tied farm cottages have been sold &amp;   
 occupied by private individuals. There
 are many self-employed &amp; professional 
 people, craftsmen &amp; people of mixed   
 talents. The falling rolls in the     
 village school reflects a drop in the 
 birthrate. There are fewer young      
 married couples as employment is away 
 from the village. There is a growing  
 number of elderly people, several     
 retired people coming to live in the  
 area. Marriage &amp; traditional values   
 are still widely held.
