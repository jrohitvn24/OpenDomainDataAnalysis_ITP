{infantry basic training unit}serving  
 six English and two Irish Regular     
 Battalions, plus six Territorial      
 Battalions.  Adult recruits join the  
 Depot from civilian life to undergo 20
 weeks of basic training.  Territorial 
 Army recruits complete 2 weeks.  The  
 Depot also organises courses for      
 weapon training, drummers and TA      
 Potential Officers.  The{permanent

 from the Regiments of the Division.   
 These men are all qualified           
 instructors in all aspects of infantry

 in the Depot themselves at some time. 
 The King's Division itself was formed 
 in{1968}when the Yorkshire,Lancastrian
 and North Irish Brigades amalgamated.
