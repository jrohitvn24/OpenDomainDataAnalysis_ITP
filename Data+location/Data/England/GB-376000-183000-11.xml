		<title>11FOX HUNTING IN HORTON</title>
		<content>   In the Winter many people go out    
 hunting foxes with the Beaufort       
 Hunt.They look very smart and the     
 horses are well groomed.The uniform of
 the Beaufort Hunt is dark green.      
   Some people do not agree with       
 hunting.They think it is cruel to kill
 the foxes. Some farmers do not like   
 them riding across their land.Other   
 people think it is good because foxes 
 kill their ducks, chickens and lambs. 
   Our class had a vote.2 people agreed
 with hunting, 5 were against and 3    
 could see good and bad in it.         
   We felt that if the foxes were not  
 doing harm they should be allowed to  
 live but if they must be killed a     
 kinder way should be used.We suggest  
 that they could be caught in a cage   
 and then taken to a zoo or given some 
 pills to put them to sleep so that    
 they do not wake up again.            </content>
