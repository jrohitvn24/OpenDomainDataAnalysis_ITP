		<title>04NEWS IN DAGENHAM</title>
		<content>   We looked at four weeks of Dagenham{
{newspapers}in the months of May and   
 June. We found much of the news was{  
{crime,}especially theft.              
   Two men clambered over garden fences
 to take two guinea pigs from someones 
 garden. Damage also filled quite a bit
 of the local papers. A{cruel sport}of 
 breeding Bull Terriors and making them
 fight against each other until one of 
 them is{killed.}People bet on the dog 
 that they think is going to live.     
   There is not only bad news, there's 
 also{good news.}One story is of a     
 mother who meets her daughter after 40
 years. Lately there have been many fun
 marathon races which have been run for
{charity}. Very recently 697 people    
 entered a 13 mile (half marathon)race 
 for charity.                          
                                       
                                       </content>
