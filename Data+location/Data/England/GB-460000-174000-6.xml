		<content> order to make it more digestible.     
 All                                   
 of the corn is sold off the farm for  
 feed.  16 cows can be milked          
 simultaneously and the milk is sent to
 Clifford's Dairy in Bracknell to be   
 treated and eventually bottled.       
 The farm finds trespassers a problem  
 because some of them leave gates open 
 with the result that the cows wander  
 out into the road and are sometimes   
 accidentally killed.                  
 Some staff have found Roman coins near
 the railway embankment on the farm;   
 also found were some horse and oxen   
 shoes (some horse shoes were for use  
 on ice winter-working) indicative of  
 the times when animals, instead of    
 tractors, did the ploughing.
