		<title>12Youth in Drayton</title>
		<content> In our village the main gangs go      
 around in two's or three's and        
 sometimes in one main group.My gang   
 has 6 children,3 girls and 3          
 boys.People resent us going around in 
 big groups and I can understand       
 why,when sometimes we play            
 'Knock,Knock Ginger'on someone's door 
 and run!Although it is naughty it is a
 good laugh,and if people gave us more 
 things to do we would'nt be like it.We
 used to have a youth club,which the   
 vicar ran but in 1984 he moved away   
 and the club closed down.Most of the  
 time we sit on the war memorial and   
 listen to music.We often get told off 
 by the older generation of Drayton for
 having no respect,which I can totally 
 agree with,but what else is there to  
 do?When it is raining we go to the pub
 where a friend lives,and we listen to 
 the juke box,slot machine and darts.  </content>
