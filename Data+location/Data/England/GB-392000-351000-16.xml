		<title>16An Educational Visit.</title>
		<content>     After spending the morning on a   
study of Cheddleton Church we arrived  
at Stanley Head Outdoor Education      
Centre in time for lunch.We ate in a   
converted cowshed.                     
     After lunch we went into one of   
the classrooms where we were given our 
instructions for the afternoon's work. 
We were divided into pairs and given an
Ordnance Survey map showing the grounds
of Stanley Head.On the map there were  
several points showing the positions of
some patterns of nails.These patterns  
could be found on;tree stumps,telegraph
poles,window frames etc. We were given 
a piece of paper and a thick wax crayon
to trace over the various nail patterns
as we found them. The winners were the 
first pair to complete the exercise    
correctly in the shortest time.
