		<title>11THE STRAWBERRY FIELDS.</title>
		<content>{Mrs Brain}rented the{strawberry fields
 in{1960.}About half a tonne in the    
 height of the season was taken out in 
 the way of small plastic containers.  
 Most of the women and children who    
 lived in Broad Town worked in the     
{strawberry fields}for{wages.}She had  
 rented it for five years .It was      
 bought by{Wilcon Ltd.}in{1970.        
 First of all{Wilcon}built a show home 
 on the corner of what was going to be 
{Broadacres}.The biggest houses are    
 1,2,2A &amp; 3 there are 24 houses in     
{Broadacres.}One of them is numbered   
 2A because they forgot to number the  
 show home.So they numbered it 2A.     
 At present 5 children from{Broadacres 
 attend{Broad Town School.
