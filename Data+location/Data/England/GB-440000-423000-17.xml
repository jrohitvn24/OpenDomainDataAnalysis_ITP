		<content> The Health Centre provides many       
 medical facilities.Several general    
 practitioners are based there besides 
 a chiropodist,speech therapist,dentist
 and school health visitor.Hightown    
 Hospital,built in 1926 as a miner's   
 convalescent hospital is now,after    
 modernisation,mainly for geriatric    
 patients.The outpatients dept.        
 specialises in neurology physiotherapy
 and occupational therapy.The casualty 
 dept.is limited, serious cases going  
 to Pontefract. Castleford has 2 homes 
 for aged persons besides bungalows and
 flats with wardens.Community care for 
 old people is still strongly          
 supported. The increasing sale of     
 whole foods and use of health clubs   
 shows how people are becoming more    
 aware of self-care. The herbalist shop
 in the market is a reminder of        
 traditional medicine.                 </content>
