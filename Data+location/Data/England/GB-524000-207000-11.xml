		<title>11EDUCATION _ Essendon School</title>
		<content>  The present school was built in 1948 
 after the second world war. The orig_ 
 inal school was demolished by a bomb  
 during the war and the children were  
 taught in the old village school. The 
 old school was on the site of the     
 present police house and the children 
 that attended were aged from 5 yrs. to
 14 yrs.                               
  The new school takes children from 5 
 _ 11 yrs, then they go on to secondary
 school. It is made from concrete slabs
 and has a flat roof. It has three     
 classrooms and a large hall which is  
 used for dinners, P.E., assemblies and
 concerts. The infant classroom was    
 added later.                          
  Our playground is surrounded by      
 fields and woods. The playing field is
 sloping with a climbing_frame.
