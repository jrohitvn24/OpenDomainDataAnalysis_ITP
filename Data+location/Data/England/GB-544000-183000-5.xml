		<content>    Our school is the oldest school    
 building in Barking. It was built in  
 1895. In our area live many people of 
 different races and religions. There  
 are people from Scotland, Ireland,    
 India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, the West 
 Indies as well as English children.   
 Most of the pupils here were born in  
 England but many parents are from     
 abroad. We have many different        
 religions: Christians, Moslems, Sikhs,
 Hindus and others. There is a {Sikh   
{Temple} nearby. Many children go there
 to worship or learn Punjabi. There is 
 also a Baptist Church which has a     
 Sunday School and the {Boys' Brigade. 
 There is a modern Catholic Church near
 with a pretty window. Mnay of our     
 pupils go out of the area to visit    
 their mosque. Children at our school  
 may speak two or even three languages.
 There are six languages in all.       </content>
