R.A.F. Edlesborough is a small camp    
site on land covering 177 acres.It is a
receiving and communications station   
and involves highly secret information.
At the centre of the site are two or   
three administration buildings and     
connected to these are many tall aerial
masts which cover the whole site.The   
site is bordered by a tall fence, and  
a local farmer grazes sheep on the     
rough grassland which covers the camp. 
Along one of roads close to the        
perimeter fence is a row of houses     
which house some of the camp's personel
and their families.
