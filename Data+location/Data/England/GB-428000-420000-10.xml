 In April my mum went to Granada       
 Television in Manchester,where they   
 are making a new series called Albion 
 Market.It is going to be like         
 Coronation Street.In the series there 
 is a wool shop.The programme will be  
 shown on television in September.When 
 she was at the studio my mum saw all  
 the people from Coronation Street they
 were having lunch in the canteen.My   
 mum also won a window dressing        
 competion .It was run by Wendy Wools  
 and it had to be a baby display.For   
 winning the competion she won Twenty  
 five pounds.
