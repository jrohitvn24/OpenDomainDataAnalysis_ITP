		<title>01NE Corner of Dalby Forest</title>
		<content> An area of roling hills and dales     
 originally called 'Dalby Warren' 75%  
 afforested by forestry commissioned   
 dating fom 1921. The older crops are  
 being felled at rotation age of 50 to 
 60 years old being replanted with     
 confiers and a sprinkling of trees.   
 There is a forest village at Low Dalby
 with information and visitor centre   
 plus forest walks and trail. A 10 mile
 forest drive crosses the area (toll   
 road).There are small holdings and    
 farms in the forest. The high plateau 
 land on either side of the Whitby Road
 is farmed for sheep and cattle for    
 beef and milk. Many hay fields. Some  
 arable and cereal crops. The aea forms
 part of the north Yorkshire Moors.    
 Very popular with walkers and pony    
 riders.
