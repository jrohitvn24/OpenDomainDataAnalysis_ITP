		<title>11A youth club.</title>
		<content> I go to{Holy Cross Youth Club.}There  
 is a television, snooker table, dart  
 board, table tennis and a tuck shop.  
 Sometimes we have discos or videos. We
 get about 30 people on Tuesday evening
 and about 60 on Fridays. The club is  
 open on Friday from 1900 hrs. to      
 2200 hrs. Membership costs Â£0.50p per 
 year and Â£0.10p per night. At the     
 youth club I have made many friends.  
 Fund-raising is sometimes needed to   
 improve our amenities such as a       
 pin-ball machine. Money was raised    
 for a mini-bus by having sponsored    
 discos.                               
 You are not allowed to smoke, swear or
 drink alchohol at the club. There is a
 Â£0.10p fine for swearing, your        
 cigarettes are thrown in the waste    
 bin, alchohol is poured down the      
 drain resulting in possible exclusion 
 from the club.                        </content>
