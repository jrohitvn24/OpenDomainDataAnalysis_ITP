		<title>09Sharlston Vicar</title>
		<content>  Rev. Ford, who is 65, has been vicar 
 in Sharlston for 7 years. He is going 
 to move, however, to another parish.  
 He is also vicar of Wragby. Sharlston 
 parish stretches from Foulby to Old   
 Snydale and Streethouse to West Lane. 
 He estimates 4,500 are in the area of 
 which 60 - 70 regularly attend Church.
 A typical day will start at 8.00 a.m. 
 with morning prayers after which he   
 sorts out his mail, visits people,    
 conducts funerals and has interviews  
 for baptisms and marriages. Evening   
 prayers follow at 6.30 p.m. Attendance
 at Church is going up and seems likely
 to increase further. Church funds come
 from offerings, fees from funerals,   
 weddings and efforts such as bazaars. 
 Rev. Ford's  replacement at Sharlston 
 will be appointed by the Bishop and at
 Wragby by Lord St. Oswald.
