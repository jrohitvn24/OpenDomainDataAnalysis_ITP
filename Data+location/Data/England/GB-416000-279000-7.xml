  The hospital is a new purpose built  
 unit designed and equipped to treat   
 acute medical or surgical conditions. 
 It is a private hospital built on land
 which is convenient to the Solihull   
 by-pass and the M42. It was opened in 
 1983 and a further development  of a  
 sports injury unit was opened in 1985 
 by the athlete, Sebastian Coe. The    
 hospital has 38 beds including 32     
 single rooms with many comforts such  
 as a telephone, television  and       
 bathroom.                             
  The hospital has provided a few new  
 jobs especially for ancillary workers.
  Many patients are short stay cases   
 and belong to private medical schemes,
 although you can pay direct by cash or
 credit card.
