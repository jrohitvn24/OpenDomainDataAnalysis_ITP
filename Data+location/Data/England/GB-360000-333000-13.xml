		<title>13Moreton Mill and Whitegates</title>
		<content>   Moreton Mill is a dairy farm        
 situated in 40 acres of land which is 
 all down to grass.The farmer has cows,
 a bull and a few chickens.The farm    
 used to be the village mill.There were
 five acres of pond which ran the mill 
 but it has been filled in.The pond was
 higher than the house so when there   
 was a lot of rain the pond flooded the
 yard and sometimes the house.The corn 
 was ground between two large stones   
 which can now be seen lying near the  
 farmhouse.                            
   White Gates Farm covers 107 acres in
 10 big fields.There are 2 farm        
 workers.It is a dairy farm with 85    
 Friesian cows,43 heifers,6 calves and 
 20 hens.3 people live at White Gates  
 Farm.There are 2 grazing fields.The   
 cows are milked twice a day.
