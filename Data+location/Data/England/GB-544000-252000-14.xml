		<title>14Earthworks at Granhams Farm</title>
		<content>  Great Shelford lies five kilometres  
 south of the city of Cambridge.       
 The position of the earthworks is     
 north of the Cam on Granta. When the  
 last Doomsday book was compiled, the  
 village was very small. The enclosure 
 of the earthworks forms a rectangular 
 shape. There is also a moat which     
 surrounds the house. On three of the  
 sides, there is a moat which also     
 surrounds a house. The east side of   
 the earthworks (the only surviving    
 side) is about one metre high in      
 places. In front of this is a narrow  
 ditch, part of the adjacents field    
 drainage system. Half of the enclosed 
 land is covered by an orchard.
