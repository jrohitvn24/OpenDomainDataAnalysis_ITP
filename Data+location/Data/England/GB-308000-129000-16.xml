		<title>16THE QUARRY</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
 Just north of Wiveliscombe, there is a
 quarry which we visited on 21 June    
 1985. To get to the quarry, you drive 
 along muddy tracks towards Whitefield.
                                       
 Then you walk along a wooded valley   
 and up a steep hill. There are piles  
 of shale all round the top of the     
 quarry. You can see these from some   
 distance off. Near the top of the     
 quarry is a broad track. Along this   
 carts and waggons were pulled about   
 100 years ago.                        
                                       
 The quarry itself is all overgrown.   
 You have to be very careful climbing  
 down into it because the path is steep
 and slippery. At the bottom of the    
 quarry is a huge pool, very deep. I   
 saw a water snake swimming around.    </content>
