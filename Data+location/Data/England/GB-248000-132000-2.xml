		<content>  The most common illness with children
 is ear aches and sore throats.The most
 common adult illness is indigestion.  
 Among old people it is bad chests and 
 arthritis.If children catch measels   
 and have spots,they have been         
 infectious for some time and are sent 
 back to school.                       
    The medical center is privately    
 owned by Mr and Mrs Lathem who are    
 doctors. It is a good centre for a    
 village and about the right size.They 
 employ the people they want.They have 
 a computer to hold the names of all   
 the patients.                         
   There are four husband and wife     
 teams of doctors around our area.The  
 people with more serious illnesses go 
 to Barnstaple.If they can't be treated
 in Barnstaple they may be sent to     
 Exeter, Bristol or even to other      
 countries for treatment.              </content>
