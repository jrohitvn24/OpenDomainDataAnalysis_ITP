		<title>13QUARRYING, HAILES</title>
		<content> The area contains two quarries, both  
 working the oolitic limestone. These  
 are to be found at grid reference 079 
 301 and at 073 290. The stone         
 extracted from the quarries is used   
 predominantly in the construction of  
 houses and for the building of walls. 
 Planning restrictions in many parts of
 the Cotswolds are still rigid, and    
 local stone must be used in new       
 building. Both quarries are small     
 scale enterprises. Each produces some 
 250000 tonnes of stone annually,      
 employing a labour force of about a   
 dozen men. The supply of stone is     
 enormous. The main constraint on      
 future expansion is the problem of the
 visual intrusion which such quarries  
 make into the Cotswold landscape.
