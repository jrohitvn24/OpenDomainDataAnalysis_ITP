		<content>  A survey was made by the children in 
 the school to find out the kinds of   
 things people do in the home.         
 JOBS ABOUT THE HOME                   
  Mothers did most of the              
 housework-type jobs although many     
 fathers helped.Most children had to do
 jobs like washing-up,shopping and     
 gardening.                            
 ENTERTAINMENT                         
  Most popular was T.V,.listening to   
 pop music and in some homes D.I.Y.    
 INTERESTS AND HOBBIES                 
  Many boys were in scout groups and   
 the men said they enjoyed gardening,  
 D.I.Y. and playing or watching        
 football.Mothers did sewing and       
 knitting whilst some went to Keep Fit.
 Very few read newspapers or visited   
 museums,art galleries or libraries.
