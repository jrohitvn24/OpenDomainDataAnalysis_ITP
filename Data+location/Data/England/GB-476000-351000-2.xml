		<title>02Hawton Church</title>
		<content>    Hawton was in existence before the 
 Roman conquest. It is also mentioned  
 in the Domesday Book when it must have
 been much larger. It used to have two 
 churches, but only one remains. The   
 church is known as All Saints.        
    The oldest part of the church is   
 the north arcade of three arches which
 date back to 1280. The style is Early 
 English. The chancel was built by, or 
 in memory of, the second Sir Robert de
 Compton who died in 1330. Over the    
 founder's tomb is the mutilateed      
 effigy of Sir Robert in chainmail. The
 East window was built about 1330 in   
 Curvilinear style and is one of the   
 finest large windows of the period.   
 There is an Easter Sepulchre in which 
 Christ' Ressurection is depicted.     
    The tower is a three stage tower,  
 built by Sir Thomas Molyneax who died 
 in 1491.                              </content>
