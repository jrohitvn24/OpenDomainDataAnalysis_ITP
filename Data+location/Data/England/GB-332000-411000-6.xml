		<content>  Mr and Mrs Costa own a small ten     
 bedroom hotel in the area.  Ther serve
 full board and there are sandwiches   
 and drinks available in the evening.  
 The hotel caters fo sixteen people    
 comfortably.  For the most part the   
 people who stay in the hotel are old  
 age pensioners who prefer to have     
 their meals at the place where they   
 are staying, rather than go into a    
 restaurant where prices are generally 
 higher.                               
  There is a lounge where residents are
 free to relax and the dining room is  
 at the front of the hotel.  Meals are 
 served at 8.30am, 1.00pm and 5.30pm.  
 The ground floor bedroom has a private
 bathroom. The average price for a week
 at the hotel is Â£70 and for Bed and   
 Breakfast it is Â£7. The Costas employ 
 no outside labour.
