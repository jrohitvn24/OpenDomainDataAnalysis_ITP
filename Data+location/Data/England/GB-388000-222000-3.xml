		<title>03WATER RECLAMATION</title>
		<content> 22 children visited{Hayden Water      
{Reclamation Works.}Mr. Owen showed us 
 around. We saw where the sewage enters
 the works from Cheltenham as a dirty  
 brown stream through the main sewer   
 which was 5km long. Recently men went 
 along the sewer to fix cable tv lines 
 sewage was first raked to remove any  
 solids..not very pleasant. The sewage 
 was allowed to settle so that all the 
 solids fell to the bottom and then    
 pumped to tanks where bacteria eat the
 solids. Liquid sewage was put through 
 filters where bacteria again ate the  
 solids. When the liquid was clean it  
 went back into the river. Solid sludge
  dried, is used as manure on the land.
 Some equipment was not working because
 there was no money.The Severn gets    
 treated sewage from towns further     
 north.Our drinkingwater comes from it!
