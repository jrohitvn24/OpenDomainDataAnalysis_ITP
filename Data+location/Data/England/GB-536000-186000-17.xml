		<title>17LEYTON LIBRARY.</title>
		<content> I go to Leyton Library which is on    
 Leyton High Road. It costs nothing to 
 get in.In the library there is        
 a section for childrens books.Another 
 section is for adults books,and the   
 last section is for people to study   
 or to read quietly.                   
 In the holidays the staff of the      
 library present puppet shows and magic
 shows for the children.               
 If you want to join the library you   
 have to fill in a form on which you   
 put your name,address and telephone   
 number.On your next visit you will get
 tickets.Children usually get 4 tickets
 and adults will get 2 or 3 or even 4. 
 I enjoy the library very much and a   
 lot of the little children enjoy the  
 pictures on the walls.
