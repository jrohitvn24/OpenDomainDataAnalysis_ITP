		<content> On 8 July 1985 four pupils from       
 Longdendale School went to The        
 Hollies, a home for elderly people. We
 talked to them about their schooling. 
   Mrs Pointer told us she went to the 
 Primary School in Hollingworth which  
 is still used today. This was also her
 senior school too. School started at  
 8.45 am and they worked though to 12. 
 You then went home for dinner and     
 returned at 1.30 pm and then worked   
 through to 4pm.                       
   The subjects taught were nothing    
 like our lessons today. There was     
 reading, writing and arithmetic and   
 they said lots of prayers and sang    
 songs.                                
   Schools were very strict then and   
 the cane was used frquently. Mrs      
 Pointer said she remembered being     
 caned just for being rude to a girl   
 who was younger than her.             </content>
