		<title>10SIR ROBERT GEFFERY'S SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Sir Robert Geffery was a local person 
 who went to London in the 17th century
 and became Lord Mayor(1686) as well as
 a member of The Worshipful Company of 
 Ironmongers.He remembered Landrake in 
 his Will,part of which is on a slate  
 in Landrake Church.                   
 The present school bears his name in  
 memory of the bequests he made,and is 
 Voluntary Aided with members of the   
 Ironmongers Company making up two     
 thirds of the governing body.         
 Children can start school from before 
 their fifth birthday until eleven.At  
 present on roll there are 105 children
 but this is likely to grow in the near
 future with housing developments.     
 There are four full time members of   
 staff and a part time teacher.Meals   
 are cooked on site by the two cooks   
 and the children are supervised at    
 mealtimes by a dinner lady &amp; teacher. </content>
