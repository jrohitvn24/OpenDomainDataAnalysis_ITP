{Recreation: The Marine Gardens        
    Altogether there are four Marine   
 Gardens.Each garden is named after the
 terrace:Adelaide,Crescent,Beachbank,  
 and Marine.They were opened on March  
 30th 1935;before that they werefields.
 The gardens are open from 8a.m.until  
 dusk and are looked after by one      
 gardener.The Gardens are very colour- 
 ful and beautiful with evergreen      
 shrubs and geraniums.The gardens      
 attract mainly elderly people &amp; those 
 with young children.People were inter-
 viewed and we discovered that they    
 came to the gardens to enjoy the      
 scenery, the quiet and because it is  
 safe for toddlers to play. People like
 to relax and sunbathe here   and there
 are lots of benches in sheltered      
 places away from the wind.There is    
 some vandalism:plants pulled up.      </content>
