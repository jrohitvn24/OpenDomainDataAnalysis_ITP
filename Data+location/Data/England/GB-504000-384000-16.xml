		<content>   It is very quiet on the Estate,     
 especially when the children are at   
 school. The Clubhouse and swimming    
 pool are useful amenities. There are  
 Brownie, Guide and Cub packs for the  
 children and occasionally disco       
 dances. The Clubhouse is licenced for 
 the sale of alcohol and is open every 
 night except Mondays. The children    
 look forward to the Estate Gala and   
 the Christmas party.                  
   The Estate shop is very useful. It  
 is run by Mr. &amp; Mrs. Reynolds.        
 Residents have to go three miles to   
 the next nearest shop at{Faldingworth.

 the children to play. Of 24 children  
 living on the Estate and attending the
 school; 13 moved to the Estate from   
 other places in Lincolnshire, 8 from
