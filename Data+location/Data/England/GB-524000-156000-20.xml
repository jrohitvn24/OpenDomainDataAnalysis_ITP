		<title>20The area's major employer</title>
		<content>  Legal and General Assurance Company  
 Limited has its main branch in        
 Kingswood. It is a major employer in  
 the area, having 870 managerial and   
 administrative staff, 292 computer    
 staff, 64 tradesmen and 1 nurse. The  
 company was founded in 1836 when six  
 members of the legal profession met in
 a coffee house in Fleet Street.       
 It has now grown into Europe's largest
 pension office and second largest life
 assurance group. The main offices     
 were built in the grounds of a girls' 
 school called St.Monica's and are     
 about to be demolished to make way for
 a new building which conforms more to 
 the company's needs. The landscaping  
 of the new building is designed to    
 recreate the Victorian country house  
 with most of the car parks enclosed in
 walled gardens. Accommodation will be 
 on three levels, one below ground.    </content>
