		<title>17Shopping Patterns</title>
		<content> The village of Billingshurst provides 
 the area with a good base for everyday
 shopping.{Post offices, banks and     
{newsagents}make up a busy high street.
{Jewellers, antique shops, clothes     
{stores, a sports shop &amp; supermarkets }
 (a new one is being built on the site 
 of a former garage), complete the     
 picture. However for irregular        
 shopping such as clothes, shoes,      
 furniture, bedding etc, most people   
 travel to{Horsham,Worthing, Crawley,  
{or Brighton,}where the range of stores
 is much greater. Apart from the       
 supermarkets, prices are a little     
 higher than in the surrounding towns  
 but the cost of transport is high     
{(petrol is Â£2 per gallon)}and so the  
 shops have a captive market. Whilst   
 the district is self-sufficient it    
 does not act as magnet.
