		<content>    Situated at the confluence of the  
 River Eden and the Solway Firth, Burgh
 Marsh is sea-washed grassland with    
 areas of quicksand. At the eastern end
 of the Marsh there is a monument to   
 King Edward I.                        
    Many sheep are brought from the    
 fells in the autumn and are kept on   
 the Marsh until the spring. They are  
 looked after by the Marsh Shepherd who
 ensures that they are kept safe. Low  
 tide means he can go out at any time  
 on his Honda three wheeler, but before
 a high tide he has to be sure that the
 animals are on the high marsh. At dusk
 Mr. Brown drives the sheep to the high
 marsh, the sheep get used to this     
 routine. Once settled they don't move.
 In the winter of 1984-85 only 14 out  
 of 1200 sheep were lost.              
    From spring until autumn cattle    
 occupy the marsh.                     </content>
