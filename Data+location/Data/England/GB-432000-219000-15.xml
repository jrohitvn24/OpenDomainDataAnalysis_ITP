		<title>15SPENDLOVE CENTRE,CHARLBURY</title>
		<content>  When the Spendlove Secondary School  
closed down in 1982 it was left empty  
for two years.Two business men then    
decided to turn it into a Centre for   
community use,offering units for local 
businesses,employment and facilities   
which were lacking in Charlbury.       
  Now,after seven months there is a    
computer firm,a dentist,a veterinary   
surgeon,a scientific instrument firm   
and the poetess,Pam Ayres has her      
Manager based in the building.Miss     
Ayres officially opened the Centre in  
November 1984.                         
  The hall is used for Dinners and     
Dances with a Live Band.The Badminton  
Club rents the hall three nights a     
week.                                  
  The Spendlove Centre is proving to be
a great asset in this predominantly    
rural area.
