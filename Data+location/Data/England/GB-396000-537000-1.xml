		<content>  The area is characterised by a deep  
 valley with fell-land on either side. 
 At the north-eastern corner of the    
 area is the only village,Stanhope,    
 situated by the River Wear.           
  Although Stanhope Church has a Norman
 foundation, the major development of  
 Stanhope occurred in the nineteenth   
 century when lead mining was very     
 important to the area. Further        
 expansion took place in the later half
 of this century with the opening of a 
 cement works further up the Dale,using
 the local minerals. The lead mines    
 are now closed but their spoil heaps  
 are still in evidence, but now grassed
 over and used for grazing.            
  The rest of the area is devoted to   
 agriculture,mostly sheep-farming, but 
 there is some stock fattening.
