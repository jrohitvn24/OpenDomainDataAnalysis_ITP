		<content> In the High Street can be seen the    
 Guildhall with ancient doorway and    
 some fine ironwork;also the old market
 and ware house with arches filled in, 
 at one time used as a charity school  
 and now known as The Town Hall.Another
 interesting feature is the Ball Court,
 just off the High Street.This was     
 built by W.Medlycott in 1847 and      
 "meant for the health and amusement of
 the town."The stone base of a 15th    
 century village cross now stands on   
 Sansomes Hill just off the main road. 
 There are some spectacular views to be
 had of the block from the tops of East
 Hill and Poyntington Hill.            
 On the outskirts of the village are   
 the thatched hamlet of New Town  and  
 the mills of Milborne Wick.
