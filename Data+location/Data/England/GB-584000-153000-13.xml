		<title>13A WEEK AT SCHOOL</title>
		<content>{CLASS ONE AT HOLLINGBOURNE SCHOOL}    
     The school day begins at nine     
 o'clock and finishes at three thirty  
 with an hour and a half break for     
 lunch. The day begins with            
 registration followed by an assembly. 
 On Friday we have a special "showing" 
 assembly where each class shows the   
 rest of the school the things it has  
 been doing during the week. We do     
 maths and English every day plus      
 science, art and craft, music,        
 physical education, topic work in     
 history and geography, religious      
 education and games. Sometimes we do  
 some cooking or needlecraft and there 
 are clubs for football, cricket       
 gymnastics, athletics, judo, chess,   
 drama, French and art and craft. On   
 Friday afternoons the whole school    
 goes swimming at Maidstone baths and  
 every junior in the school can swim.  </content>
