		<title>02More about Beckermet</title>
		<content>  Although a predominantly rural area, 
it tends to be dominated by the Atomic 
Energy complex at Sellafield.          
Population is largely centred in the   
village of Beckermet and this is       
generally an area of populatiion growth
the majority of families moving into   
the area are part of the workforce at  
Sellafield. Unemployment is virtually  
unknown.                               
  There are several wooded areas       
providing a natural habitat for much of
the wildlife. Wild deer are sometimes  
found. Birds are always a familar      
sight. Round here there are Mistle     
Thrushes which nest in the school roof 
and swallows and Blue Tits which nest  
in nearby barns as well as in the      
school nesting box. Also there are some
Pied Wagtails. We often see a few Heron
around. There are lots of fishes like  
Trout in the rivers.                   </content>
