      A group of children delivered a  
 questionnaire to the residents of     
 Gerrard Street, which is very near to 
 the motorway. The following day they  
 returned and asked the residents the  
 following questions:                  
                                       
 1) Were you here when the motorway was
 built, and if so, how inconvenient was
 it ?                                  
                                       
 2) Do you like living near the        
 motorway; what do you see as the      
 advantages and disadvantages ?        
                                       
 3) Do you have to take any special    
 precautions with children or pets ?   
                                       
 A brief synopsis of the transcribed   
 tape is on the following page....
