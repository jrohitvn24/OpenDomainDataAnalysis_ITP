		<title>09CHALKNEY WOOD,EARLS COLNE</title>
		<content>{Chalkney Wood}is mostly a deciduous   
 wood dating from medieval times.There 
 are 2 entrances and exits. Round the  
 outside of the wood is about 5 miles  
 walking,and staight though the middle 
 from North to South is about 4 miles. 
 There are some very nice walks there. 
 It gets very muddy after a storm      
 because horses go through the wood and
 also huntsmen go there.The huntsmen go
 there in the early morning,or late    
 evening,and you here a gunshot and I  
 think "1 rabbit down and hopefully,   
 lots more to go!"We sometimes go      
 blackberry picking in the wood,and we 
 bring some home,and then we make apple
 and blackberry wine.There is a wide   
 variety of flowers,and if you go for a
 walk you usually come home with a     
 bunch of flowers.In May there is a    
 carpet of bluebells.There are so many 
 that it is hard not to tread on them. </content>
