		<content> On Saturday I usually stay in the     
 village playing with friends I play   
 tennis on the courts with my friend . 
 We go on the field which is a wide    
 long stretch of grass where the       
 village games and important events go 
 on.My favourite thing to do on        
 Saturdays is take some dogs for a walk
 with a friend to the woods or any     
 where in the countryside and out of   
 the way.In the woods it is cool and   
 smells fresh of the trees.It is easy  
 to walk through if you follow the path
 and is very pleasant.My hobby is horse
 riding and on Sundays I go riding with
 a friend who has two ponies.Also I    
 play the violin and when I grow up I  
 hope to be a naturlist.My name is Esme
 Copestake and I am 10 years old.
