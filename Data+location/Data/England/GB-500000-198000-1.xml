		<title>01THE NORMAN CONQUEST.</title>
		<content>                                       
 On the 14th October 1066 a great      
 battle was fought between William of  
 Normandy and King Harold.The English  
 and Norman armies met at William's    
 newly-established headquarters at     
 Hastings.King Harold did not have luck
 on his side as the South coast,where  
 William landed,was not defended as    
 King Harold's Norwegian brother-in-law
 was trying to take England from the   
 North.So after beating the Norwegians 
 the English army had to march down to 
 Hastings.On the south coast           
 William,eager to lead his men,leapt   
 out his boat and rushed up onto the   
 beach but he slipped and his men      
 thought this must be a bad omen,but   
 events later in the day show that that
 was not so.At 9 o'clock the Norman    
 army was deployed trumpets sounded    
 then the terrible battle started.     </content>
