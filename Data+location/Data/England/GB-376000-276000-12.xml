		<content>      The age of this ancient woodland 
 is indicated by the presence of the   
 wild Service,Gean (or wild Cherry) and
 Yew trees. It is unusual for its wide 
 range of species, some very rare. The 
 soil is acid and the climate is such  
 that examples of flora from both North
 and South are present. Sessile Oak and
 Wood Cranesbill mingle with Pedunc-   
 ulate Oak and Alder Blackthorn.The    
 trees are mainly Oak and Birch, while 
 the understorey includes Hazel and    
 Guelder Rose. Rare Small-leaved Lime  
 grows along the banks of Dowles Brook.
     Among the rarer flowering plants: 
 Long-leaved Helleborine, Aquilegia,   
 Autumn Crocus, Green-winged Orchid,   
 Dog's Mercury, and Wood Anemone.      
 Adder's-tongue Fern can be found and  
 the damp shaded valleys provide an    
 ideal environment for a wide range of 
 mosses and lichens, some very rare.   </content>
