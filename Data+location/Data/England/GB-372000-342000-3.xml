		<title>03WHERE DO PEOPLE WORK?</title>
		<content> Most of the land around Woore is used 
 for{dairy-farming.} Modern farming    
 methods mean that very few people are 
 employed on the land.   Hay-making has
 practically disappeared, and most of  
 the grass is cut for{silage.}         
 There are shops and services in the   
 village, and the{Phoenix Factory}in   
 Pipe Gate, but people go outside the  
 village to work. Most go by car.      
 We found that more than half of the   
 fathers were "professional".   There  
 were managers or salesmen in companies
 or banks.   Some were teachers, some  
 worked with computers.                
 The most usual place for employment   
 was in{Staffordshire,}in an area      
 running down from{Kidsgrove}through   
 the{Potteries and Newcastle.}         
 Surveying 26 families shows{14 mothers
 employed full-time or part-time,{6 in 
{Woore,}the rest spread within 10 miles</content>
