		<title>06SALTBURN COMMUNITY SERVICES</title>
		<content> Saltburn is well equipped for its     
 community and voluntary services. Some
 relate to its position as a seaside   
 resort such as Lifeguards, Red Cross  
 and Coastguards. There are 3 doctors  
 practices, 2 of which cover Marske as 
 well as Saltburn and also a clinic to 
 provide maternity care. The present   
 police station replaced the old one in
 1928, but has decreased in importance 
 (with major crimes being referred to  
 Redcar). The fire brigade is run by   
 volunteers and those who turn up at an
 emergency are paid. Voluntary services
 provide help for nearly all needs.    
 Suprisingly not many unemployed youths
 volunteer for this work but many      
 middle aged women do. There are       
 various associations, play groups,    
 social groups and groups catering for 
 the handicapped.(F.Roughton,J.Croker)
