		<title>02DOGSTHORPE BRICKWORKS 1</title>
		<content> These{Brickworks}were opened in 1890  
 but new extensions were built 2 years 
 ago.There were 3 kilns each with 16   
 chambers.A wicket keeps the heat in   
 and a Jack Arch allows it to expand   
 when heated.The temperature inside    
 reaches 1000 degrees Celsius.Inside   
 the kiln we saw the bricks glowing    
 amber.Each chamber holds 24000 bricks.
 Clay is scooped from the pits and then
 travels on a conveyor belt 1.25 miles 
 to the works where a machine grinds it
 up.It is then pressed 4 times into    
 large green bricks which is then      
 chipped and covered in water before   
 being fired.It costs Â£5.40 to produce 
 100 bricks but they sell for about    
 Â£9.00.In 1 hour 10358 bricks are      
 produced.Only{builders}can buy more   
 than 1000 bricks at a time.
