 children from 3 to 5 years old.They go
 on Monday and Thursday mornings.There 
 are about 20 children and 2 helpers.  
 It costs  65p each morning for the    
 children to go there. There has been a
 play group in Sidlesham for 18  years 
 and in September it is moving from    
 Keynor Hut to Sidlesham School.       
  The old part of Sidlesham School was 
 built as a Board School in 1877. In   
 1908 another classroom was built on so
 that it was big enough for 210        
 children. In 1933 four more classrooms
 Were built on. Today  there are 70    
 children in the School. There are 4   
 teachers and 8 other staff.The        
 children mainiy come from Sidlesham   
 and Almodington. When the  children   
 are 10 years old  they go to Manhood  
 Secondary School.
