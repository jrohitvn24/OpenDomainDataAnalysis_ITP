		<content>Ronald and Dorothy Brook rent 66 acres 
from Oxfordshire County Council. It is 
a dairy farm with 60 milk cows,1 bull  
and some heifers.                      
His day starts at 6 a.m. Milking takes 
1.5 hours, in a 6 bay parlour. He      
breakfasts after seeing to the calves, 
his horse and pony. Office work is done
on rainy days.                         
Four sons help at busy times; 3 are in 
farming and 1 in a factory.            
Silage is made, straw collected from   
other farms. Hay from Nuneham Arboretum
is saved for the calves winter feed.   
Milk is collected every morning by     
tanker and taken to Ruislip,Middx.     
The house was built in 1938; Mr. Brook 
moved there 10 years ago. He comes from
Lancashire, having trained at          
Agricultural College after National    
Service. Previously they had a small   
market garden in Hampshire.            </content>
