		<title>19THE PRIMARY SCHOOL,HILTON</title>
		<content> The Primary School,N.O.R.150  is      
 based on two sites in the village. The
 original buildings - one classroom and
 a school house - were erected in 1856,
 and a second larger area was added in 
 1882. Log books for the school, dating
 back to 1880 provide a wealth of      
 fascinating information about the     
 school's history, from closure for the
 Tutbury Statutes (hiring fair),through
 the arrival of a contingent of        
 evaccuees from Birmingham, right up to
 the present day.In 1970 a new Infants 
 school was built at the other end of  
 the village. It is a modern school    
 with its own small swimming pool, for 
 which funds were raised by the P.T.A. 
 in the 1960's. At present plans are in
 effect for a new Junior department to 
 be incorporated on the same site,and  
 work is due to begin early in 1986.
