		<title>15Junior School Log.</title>
		<content>      From the log book of Surfleet    
 Sea's End School on Friday 19th July  
 1985:-  "Nurse Whiteley took her leave
 of us today.  Mrs. White will be our  
 'eads 'n' 'ands lady next term.       
      P.C. Priestly spoke to the       
 children today about holiday safety - 
 in the street, in the home or by the  
 water.                                
      Assembly was at the end of the   
 day and we said our goodbyes to 12    
 children, 1 to Spalding Grammar, 1 to 
 Spalding High, 2 to Priory School and 
 8 to Spalding Gleed Schools.          
      Samantha Minshull won the        
 girls'Cup for best performance.  The  
 boys' cup was not won.                
      The leavers presented prizes to  
 the staff before they departed.       
      Next term's roll is expected to  
 be thirty-six children."
