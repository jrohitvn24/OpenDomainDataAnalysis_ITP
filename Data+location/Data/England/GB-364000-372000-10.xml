		<content> AS IN MANY OTHER AREAS OF BRITAIN,THE 
 PEOPLE OF THE NORTHWICH BLOCK ARE     
 TAKING GREATER CARE OF THEMSELVES AND 
 GIVING PERSONAL HEALTH AN IMPORTANT   
 PLACE IN THEIR DAY-TO-DAY LIVES.      
  THIS IS REFLECTED IN THE NUMBER OF   
 GROUPS WHO RUN COURSES IN KEEP-FIT AND
 AEROBICS FOR THEMSELVES AND OTHERS.IN 
 THE LAST TWO YEARS TWO PURPOSE-BUILT  
 HEALTH CLUBS HAVE OPENED.THEY ARE     
 "NORTHWICH HEALTH AND LEISURE" AND    
 "INTRIM"AND BOTH PROVIDE THEIR MEMBERS
 WITH FACILITIES TO IMPROVE FITNESS.   
  THERE ARE MANY JOGGERS TO BE SEEN IN 
 THE AREA ESPECIALLY AROUND OCTOBER    
 WHEN THE NORTHWICH HALF-MARATHON TAKES
 PLACE.IN 1985 THE PROCEEDS ARE TO GO  
 TO"LIVE AID",THE ETHIOPIAN DISASTER   
 FUND.IN OUR OWN SURVEY THE IMPORTANCE 
 OF HEALTH IS SHOWN BY THE FACT THAT   
 54% OF FORMER CIGARETTE SMOKERS HAVE  
 GIVEN UP IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS.      </content>
