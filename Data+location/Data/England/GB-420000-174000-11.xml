		<title>11My school day</title>
		<content> Some days I come to Ogbourne primary  
 school by car and some days I cycle,I 
 like riding my bicycle if it is not   
 raining.At nine oclock we all go into 
 the assembly room to listen to music, 
 sing songs,and say prayers,sometimes  
 our class is in charge of assembly and
 some times the infant class does it.In
 the morning we work at maths,hand     
 writing,story writing.In the          
 afternoon we do games, art,making     
 models,science.                       
 Our play time is in the morning.we    
 have 20 minutes,I dont like going out 
 to play unless its hot out side.      
 We have dinner at midday,I have a     
 school dinner,some people have packed 
 lunches,or go home.After dinner we    
 have quiet reading In the library.    
 I go home at 3.15 on the school bus,  
 with fourteen other children.         
 There are 45 children in the school.  </content>
