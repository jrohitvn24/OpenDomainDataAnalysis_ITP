		<title>18A SUNDAY IN CARLISLE</title>
		<content>  I usually get up at about 10.30.My   
 breakfast is usually a cereal,a cup   
 of tea and two pieces of toast.I some-
 times go out to play on a bike or help
 my dad in the garden.If dad is at home
 we have our big meal at lunchtime,but 
 if he is at work we have it at teatime
 We usually have chicken,lamb or beef. 
 I help my mam to wash up the dishes.  
 When we have done that we watch tele- 
 vision.Then we go to my nanna's,have  
 tea,and walk by the River Eden.You can
 see different types of birds flying by
 the river,ducks and even geese.We come
 back to my nanna's and have our tea.It
 is usually a packet of crisps and some
 jelly and fresh cream.After we have   
 had our tea we come away and when we  
 get home I have a bath.Then I have a  
 drink of tea and go to bed.
