		<content>   There are two schools in our        
 village. Our{old school}is over one   
 hundred years old and some of our     
 parents went there when they were     
 children.The building is still used   
 for church meetings.                  
   We have had a{new school}built which
 is in one of our new estates.We have  
 in our new school more facilities     
 such as indoor toilets, a gym/hall,   
 playing fields and gardens.           
   School is from 9 am until 3.30 pm   
 with an hour for lunch.  At school as 
 well as Maths and English we do some  
 computing,art and craft,music and     
 dancing,and topic work in History and 
 Geography. We play{games}like netball,
 football and sometimes cricket.       
   We have outings to the theatre and  
 field trips sometimes for 4 days.     
   When we leave school we go to       
 Richmond Comprehensive School.        </content>
