		<content>     The Romans settled in Oldbury on  
 Severn about 2000 years ago.          
    There are still remains of a Roman 
 Fort.  We can still see parts of the  
 ditch and defence wall that used to   
 surround the camp.                    
    At the back of our school, the     
 Romans built a small hill which was   
 used as a place of worship to Jupiter.
 This was also a look-out point, as    
 there is a very good view of the      
 surrounding countryside.              
    Oldbury was an active port until   
 this century.  Brick and tiles were   
 brought from Whale Wharf near         
 Littleton on Severn a small village on
 the Severn, to Oldbury where they were
 ferried across the Severn to Wales.   
 They brought back coal in exchange for
 the bricks and tiles.  100 years ago  
 there was a working clay pit in       
 Oldbury.                              </content>
