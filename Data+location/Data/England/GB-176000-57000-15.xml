 The population of Cubert and Holywell 
 having remained relatively stable for 
 many years, has increased dramatically
 in the last l0 years with housing     
 development taking place in the       
 vicinity of the church, Chynowen Parc 
 and Wheal Golden at Holywell.         
                                       
 Many established residents are        
 concerned that this development has   
 come too rapidly for the village      
 considering the limited amenities and 
 employment prospects.                 
                                       
{Electrol roll census}figures for l976 
 were 443 compared with 735 in l985.   
{Population census}figures for l98l    
 were 825 but this has probably reached
 almost l000 in l985.  There are 7     
 Parish councillors who meet monthly.  
 The area of the parish is 34l9 acres. </content>
