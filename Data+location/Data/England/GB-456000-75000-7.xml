 Ventnor Carnival is the second oldest 
 in the country. Carnival week is the  
 third week in August and there are two
 processions, one illuminated. The     
 Carnival Queen leads the procession   
 from Albert Street to the Park. Many  
 floats and bands take part.           
 The first week-long Smuggling Pageant 
 was held four years ago to remind     
 people of the local connection with   
 smuggling. Many people wear 19th      
 century costume for a week. There are 
 encounters between smugglers and      
 militia men and other related events. 
 The Crab Fayre was held on a site near
 the Crab and Lobster Inn many years   
 ago. It sold mainly crabs caught      
 locally. In 1976 the Lions Club       
 revived the Fayre at the Botanic      
 Gardens. It takes place on Spring Bank
 Holiday Monday.                       </content>
