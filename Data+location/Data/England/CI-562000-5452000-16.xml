		<title>16How the Land is Used</title>
		<content>      The area we looked at was mostly 
 agricultural land. Most of the        
 buildings were farms which were made  
 out of granite. Most of the crops were
 potatoes also I saw some cabbages,    
 courgettes, carrots, beans and        
 tomatoes. I saw only one apple        
 orchard. Most of the fields were      
 crops, sown grass or rough pasture.   
 Some of the rough pasture was used for
 grazing and I saw quite a lot of cows 
 and a few horses. The area that I     
 visited was called Les Augres and it  
 was in Trinity. There were quite a few
 private houses and they all had       
 gardens, some had vegetables growing  
 in them as well as flowers. Some      
 people were selling their vegetables  
 on stalls by their gates. I also saw  
 at least two shops, one of them sold  
 tyres.                                
                                       </content>
