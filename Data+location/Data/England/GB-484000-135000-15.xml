		<title>15At the dentist</title>
		<content>      Most times when I go to the      
 dentist I{feel scared.}Lately I have  
 had three{fillings,}it was really     
 horrible!!  First I had my mouth      
{numbed}and made really{dry.}Then I    
 had a kind of{vacuum}in my mouth      
 to get all the pieces of food out.    
 Then I had a{drill}which drilled a    
 hole in my tooth, then the dentist    
 fired loads of air into the hole.     
 Boy did{it hurt,}it was{really        
{painful.                              
      Then she put some{goey stuff}in  
 it which was the{filling}itself, then 
 she kind of{sealed}it up with some    
 queer stuff, then she blew some more  
 air in and that hurt just as much as  
 the first time. I hoped I'd never have
 to go again but I have to go every    
 four months.{I hate it!
