		<title>10HASELEY MANOR, ARRETON</title>
		<content>  This survey finds Haseley once       
 again an important name on the        
 Island's map.  At the last Domesday   
 Haseley was a manor in the hands of   
 the king (William 1st), now it is as a
 tourist attraction.                   
     We have spent the last 8 years    
 re-building the house from a virtual  
 ruin.  We have discovered that half of
 the south wing dates almost back to   
 Domesday and we have been re-building 
 the house back to its various periods.
     Brand new is our craft pottery and
 we have become one of the larger      
 employers in the Arreton area.        
     Teapots, coffee sets, eggcups,    
 plates are all made here and decorated
 with our distinctive floral patterns.
