<content>

The cinema present in the last article (25 years ago) has now gone - demolished and replaced by a similar shape and size building which was, until it's recent demise, occupied by Woolworths (now TJ Hughes) The closest cinema to the town now is located at Junction 10 (M6) in Bentley Mill Way - this is a 10 screen Showcase cinema - with a Casino also occupying the same site. This is out of town - meaning the town centre is now devoid of a cinema (having had 10+ film venues in previous decades!)   &lt;br />
