MOST COMMERCIALLY PROSPEROUS TOURIST   
ATTRACTIONS OF OUR AREA,AND HAS BEEN SO

VIEWING IN THE 1800'S.                 
 ANNE HATHAWAY,SHAKESPEARE'S WIFE,AND  
MOTHER TO HIS THREE CHILDREN LIVED,WITH
HER FAMILY,IN THE COTTAGE WHICH AT THE 
TIME WAS A LARGE FARM CALLED "HEWLANDS 
FARMHOUSE".IT RETAINED THIS NAME UNTIL 
THE VICTORIAN ERA WHEN ITS OWNER MARY  
BAKER,A DESCENDANT OF THE HATHAWAY LINE
RENAMED IT AS IT IS TODAY.THE HATHAWAY 
FAMILY LIVED IN THE FARMHOUSE FOR 13   
GENERATIONS UNTIL JUST BEFORE THE FIRST
WORLD WAR.                             
 ALMOST HALF A MILLION TOURISTS COME   
FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD EACH YEAR TO   
LOOK AROUND THE COTTAGE,WHICH IS       
SITUATED A MILE AND A HALF FROM THE    
TOWN CENTRE OF STRATFORD-UPON-AVON,IN  
THE VILLAGE OF SHOTTERY.               </content>
