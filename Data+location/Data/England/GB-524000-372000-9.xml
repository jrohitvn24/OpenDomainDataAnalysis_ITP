		<content> In 1977 archaeologists found a bronze 
 age burial ground near the gravelpits.
 A team of enthusiasts was led by Miss 
 Naomi Field of the North Lincs Arch-  
 aeological Unit.During the summer they
 found remains of a cremation and an   
 almost intact pot.The cremation pit   
 was oval in shape and measured 80cm x 
 60cm x 20cm deep and was filled with  
 charcoal, heat shattered flint and    
 some cremated bone.The pit lay one    
 field noth of an early bronze age     
 barrow,half of which had been quarried
 away.There were three ditches visable 
 and a collared urn was found which    
 contained cremated bone, two flint    
 arrow heads and a bronze razor.Both   
 sites were found with the aid of      
 aerial photography.
