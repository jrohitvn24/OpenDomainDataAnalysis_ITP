		<title>11The Crown Inn, Middleton.</title>
		<content>  The Crown stands beside the A47 road 
 in the centre of Middleton.It is      
 basically a village inn but it does   
 have a substantial passing trade.The  
 landlady told us that most of the     
 regular customers live in Middleton   
 and that they account for about 80% of
 the business in Winter and about 60%  
 in Summer.                            
{ Meals}form a very important part of  
 the business. Gammon is the most      
 popular dish in Winter and Ploughmans 
 Lunches are the most popular in the   
 Summer. Sunday lunches are popular.   
{Beer}is still the most popular drink. 
  Several clubs in the village meet    
 regularly at the crown which provides 
 a useful focal point for entertainment
 in the village.                       
  There is another inn at Fair Green   
 but North Runcton has no public house.
