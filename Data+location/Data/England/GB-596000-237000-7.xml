		<title>07  Employment in Polstead.</title>
		<content> The greater part of the survey area is
agricultural land,producing sugar beet 
,grain, and soft fruits, especially the
famous Polstead Black Cherries.There is
also a large amount of pasture land for
cattle ,horses and ponies kept for     
leisure purposes.The Pym family at     
Maria Marten's cottage keep a herd of  
Suffolk sheep;lambs from this herd are 
sold as far away as Russia.These       
fortunate sheep have oil paintings on  
the walls of their pens.               
  The arable land is light,gravelly,and
well drained.At one time most men used 
to work on the farms,but now the       
tractor has taken over from the horse, 
the arable land is managed by a        
few men,mainly the owners or leasees of
the farms,with a little casual help.   
Now there are about 250 houses,with 600
inhabitants.Some cottages are well     
preserved 15TH century thatch.         </content>
