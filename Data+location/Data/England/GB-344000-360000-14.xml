		<content> The north-south route of the busy     
 A41(T) Chester to Whitchurch road     
 almost bissects the area &amp; carries    
 heavy container lorries as well as    
 cars &amp; buses.Three minor roads off it 
 lead to Tattenhall(east along Chester 
 Road),west to Bruera on Platts        
 Lane(this having a vehicle weight     
 limit of 3 tons partly to prevent its 
 use by the army from Chester although 
 it is used for army training runs) &amp;  
 to Hatton House &amp; Hall.A section of   
 Long Lane to Waverton is in the NE.of 
 the area.There is linear settlement   
 along all of these roads with farms &amp; 
 single houses as well as some         
 businesses but there is a group of    
 buildings at Gatesheath as well as at 
 Saighton with its 3 minor roads. Off  
 the A41,with its empty lodge to let,is
 the disused "Waverton Approach" to the
 Duke of Westminster's Eaton Hall.     </content>
