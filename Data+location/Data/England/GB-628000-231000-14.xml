		<content>On Friday 12th July 1985 we went down  
to the beach and did a survey about    
Felixstowe. We did this because we     
wanted to ask tourists what they       
thought about our town. When we got    
there we split into four groups. One   
group went down on the beach, another  
group went outside Charlie Mannings and
other amusments; another group went to 
the gardens and along the promenade.   
The last group went near the hotels.   
Most of the people we asked were       
elderly people, because the young      
people were at school and the middle   
aged ones were at work. Some people    
were sitting in sun chairs on the      
beach.Many were walking along and      
mothers were pushing babies. The       
weather on that afternoon was breezy   
but warm and sunny.We were glad the    
weather was so nice because  it        
attracted the tourists.                </content>
