		<title>03Christchurch Park Ipswich</title>
		<content>The park is situated near to the centre
of town.                               
The park orginally belonged to the     
mansion which is situated in the       
south-east corner.Today the park is    
free for anyone to use.The mansion is  
'famous' in Ipswich.It was built about 
500 years ago.The majority of people   
use the park Â£as a nice place to have  
a walk'.The park is split into two     
sections,the arboretum where           
plants,trees and shrubs come from many 
different countries.The other part is  
much larger and has many large grass   
areas.Many people use the park as a    
short-cut to the centre of town.We     
interviewed 40 people and only about 5 
lived more than a couple of miles from 
the park.The park has a playground and 
several tennis courts.The park has one 
quite large duck pond as well as a     
circular pond by the Mansion.          </content>
