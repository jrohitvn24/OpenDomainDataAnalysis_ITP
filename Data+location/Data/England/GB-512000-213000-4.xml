		<title>04The River Lea, Harpenden</title>
		<content> The River Lea at Batford is a most    
 interesting area.   Many birds nest   
 there including this year, a family of
 grebes.   The park nearby is very     
 popular.   Down by the river there is 
 a forge.   A blacksmith used to make  
 horseshoes there.   Now two brothers  
 make beautiful wrought iron gates and 
 will try to fix almost anything, even 
 lawn mowers.                          
 The Upper Lea Valley Group try to do a
 lot of conservation work, including   
 clearing and opening up the pathway   
 where the railway used to run from    
 Hemel Hempstead to Dunstable.   They  
 have created a very attractive weir, a
 waterfall and a stepping stone area   
 near the park.                        
 The ford is a popular place for wading
 and fishing, the most usual catches   
 being minnows, tadpoles and           
 sticklebacks.                         </content>
