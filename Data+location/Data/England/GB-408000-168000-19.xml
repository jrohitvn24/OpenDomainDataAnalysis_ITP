		<content> After school on Mondays my sisters    
 Sarah and Emily and myself go to      
 ballet classes in Marlborough. Here we
 do exercises and dances. On Tuesdays I
 have to go to be taught piano at      
 Manton I find this rather boring. I   
 come back at about 4.30 p.m so I can  
 go outside to play. I sometimes go and
 weed my own garden or I go and watch  
 the television but more often than not
 I go out on my bike. On Wednesday     
 after school I go to Calne for        
 swimming. I do survival badges as well
 as general learning but it takes a lot
 of practice. On Thursday I just play  
 around the village after school as I  
 do on Fridays. On Wednesday evening   
 after swimming and tea I usually go to
 youth club where I can play darts or  
 snooker. Theres a game on a table     
 where you have to operate a game of   
 football. There is also table tennis. </content>
