		<title>02A WALK IN ABBOTS BROMLEY.</title>
		<content> We went out to look for things in     
 Abbots Bromley. First we found the    
 Alms houses and the date on it was    
 17O5. Then past that we saw the church
 and the Church House. In the church   
 house a playgroup is held and so is a 
 Sunday School. Then we walked across  
 and found some old barns and then we  
 went up the street to the institute   
 and that is where another nursery     
 school is. The Royal Oak is a pub and 
 we saw that as we went by. The Hayward
 Marionettes is a puppet museum. It    
 shows puppets of all kinds. The       
 Bagot Arms is a pub. We had a look at 
 the police station.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
