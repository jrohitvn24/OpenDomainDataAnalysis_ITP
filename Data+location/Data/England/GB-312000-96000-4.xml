		<content> Gardening is probably the most popular
 hobby; the Annual WI flower show is   
 well patronised and is one of the     
 events of the Village year. Two keen  
 amateur orchid growers live in the    
 village one of them the Patron of the 
 Devon Orchid Society and the other a  
 committee member and judge.           
 All the other country pursuits are    
 widely practised including walking,   
 horse-riding, bird-watching and rough 
 and clay-pigeon shooting. One         
 or two people still keep              
 ferrets and use them.                 
 Skittles and darts are popular, but   
 people have to go to Honiton to find a
 team.                                 
 The village also seems to have more   
 than its share of artists.            
 The football club has lapsed due to   
 the reduction in the appropriate age  
 group over the last twenty years.     </content>
