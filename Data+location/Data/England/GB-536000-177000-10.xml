		<title>10Tourists in Greenwich</title>
		<content>Tourists begin coming to Greenwich at  
Easter.In the beginning of the year it 
is mostly French tourists that come to 
Greenwich then English and after that a
mixture.Round the Cutty Sark and in    
the v park are usually the most        
crowded places  between eleven o,clock 
in the morning and   four in the       
afternoon.                             
    There are thousands of tourists in 
Greenwich and around two o,clock it is 
very  hard even to walk on the         
pavement.The tourists that come to     
Greenwich bring a lot of money.Most of 
them stay only for the day.Often prices
in the shop are higher then they might 
usually be.The tourists come from place
like France U.S.A.,Japan and Canada.Bu 
even though the tourists bring lots of 
money in summer the shops donÂ£t        
completely depend on them.
