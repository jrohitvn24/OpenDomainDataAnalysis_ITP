		<title>03BAR HILL</title>
		<content> The shops,village green,community     
 centre &amp;etc all being,more or less,in 
 the centre.There is plenty of play    
 areas,open space,trees and attractive 
 landscaping.The main service road,the 
 perimeter road,encircles the village  
 and all the housing areas are reached,
 by traffic,from this road - there are,
 therefore, no main roads to be        
 crossed,in the village itself,by      
 pedestrians.                          
   Bar Hill is placed well for other   
 towns and cities.It is at the head of 
 the new M11 to London,the A1 is only  
 twelve miles away,Cambridge is about  
 six miles to the south and Huntingdon 
 and St.Ives are a few miles north.    
   As Bar Hill is so new we did        
 a questionnaire survey to see what the
 residents think of their village.The  
 results of this survey are given on   
 later pages.                          </content>
