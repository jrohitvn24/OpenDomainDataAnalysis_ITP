		<content> cats.  I watch television usually     
 "Let's Pretend' then set off for      
 school.  I get to school about l2.55. 
 I have registration then go to my     
 next lesson.  End of school bell at   
 3.35.  I get home about 4.oo.  I watch
 television for a little while then do 
 any homework that has to be done for  
 the next day.  I always do my homework
 late.  After my homework is done I go 
 up to my bedroom and have a muck      
 about.  At 5.3O I have my tea, usually
 while watching television.  After tea 
 I get ready to go to Guides.  Me and  
 my cousin help at Brownies, we are    
 Pack Leaders.  After Brownies it is   
 Guides.  We always have a muck about  
 at Guides, it's a laugh.At 9.OO my mum
 comes to pick me up.  When I get home 
 I usually have my supper, watch a bit 
 of T.V., then I go to my room, get    
 undressed,wash,get into bed and read. </content>
