		<content> Children's leisure time activities.   
 We surveyed the children in our class 
 who live in the 12km block and found  
 that most of the twenty have several  
 hobbies and take part in some type of 
 sport.Most of the children played in  
 one of the school teams or for a      
 cubscout football team.The most       
 popular activities were watching T.V.,
 reading,riding bicycles,computer      
 games,jigsaw puzzles and roller       
 skating.Only three out of twenty      
 children did any knitting or sewing.  
 One helped his father with the        
 gardening.Four children made          
 collections of various things and two 
 were model makers.Twelve children     
 joined in school clubs such as        
 badminton,model railway or music.     
 Eleven children went to a local club  
 on their housing estate or to a church
 group.    C.S.Hall.                   </content>
