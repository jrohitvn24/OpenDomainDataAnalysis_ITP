		<title>14Young people in Lydlinch</title>
		<content>   There is very little for youngsters 
 in the area. The school in Lydlinch   
 closed many years ago and is now a    
 private house.All children of school- 
 age from Lydlinch,Stock and Kingstag  
 have to travel by bus into Sturminster
 each day.                             
   There are no recreational facilities
 and the nearest youth clubs are at    
 Stalbridge and Sturminster.Several    
 attempts have been made to start some 
 kind of club but have failed for lack 
 of leaders.                           
   The youth who live there say they   
 spend their spare time riding their   
 bikes,fishing and watching television.
   Because of the lack of public       
 transport they are all dependent on   
 their parents to drive them to        
 clubs,football matches etc. which they
 find very limiting.
