		<title>02THE FIRE STATION</title>
		<content>   In Stapleford there is a fire       
 station. They have only one fire      
 engine, because it is only a part time
 station. They practice every Monday   
 night. The chief of the station is    
 Sub. Officer Higton. The two leading  
 fireman are leading fireman Cooper and
 leading fireman Gunn. They go to fires
 such as: shed fires, factory fires,   
 car fires and any accidents. They     
 carry two hose reels, twenty rolls of 
 hose, ten sets of breathing apparatus,
 keys, bars and standpipes. On the top 
 of the fire engine are two blue lights
 and horns, a fifty foot ladder and a  
 twenty-five foot extension ladder.    
 They wear a helmet, a tunic, trousers 
 and boots.
