		<title>17NEWICK BONFIRE SOCIETY</title>
		<content>    Early in the 20th century, lads of 
 the village banded together into a    
 bonfife society and held bonfire      
 nights that were rough, noisy and     
 hazardous. Torchlight processions     
 included people on horseback, banners 
 were carried and fireworks, known as  
 Newick Rousers, made in the local     
 bakery, were set off.                 
    Today the Bonfire Society is in    
 much more sensible hands. The         
 torchlight procession, bonfire and    
 fireworks on the Green are an exciting
 event in the year for Newick          
 children.The Society works hard       
 throughout the year, raising money to 
 pay for costumes and fireworks, and   
 all the money collected on the night  
 (always the Saturday before 5th Nov.  
 to avoid clashing with the Lewes cele-
 brations) goes to charity.
