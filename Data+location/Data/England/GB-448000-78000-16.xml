		<content>  Several people said they had         
 experienced ghostly happenings in our 
 survey area,but none came more        
 exciting than the woman who reported  
 being jostled in the pews of her local
 church.She told us of her story,and   
 how she went to pray but found herself
 being pushed from all sides as if the 
 church was overcrowded.               
  Another member of the community that 
 we interviewed brought back to life   
 his distraught story of how many      
 people believed that a small goblin-  
 like man was present in his bedroom.He
 continued to reminisce and stated how 
 even mediums staying at his house had 
 the same feeling.At last he took part 
 in a occult style service,and         
 surprisingly enough the man never     
 appeared again.His story is generally 
 believed as at the time he was running
 for the local parliament.             </content>
