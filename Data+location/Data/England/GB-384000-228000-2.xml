		<content> The Vicar,{Rev D.Field,}living in     
 Apperley, controls the 4 churches to  
 help unite the area. Odda's Chapel was
 dedicated in 1056 and is therefore    
 Saxon with{Romanesque architecture.   
 Originally there were two floors but  
 now only one remains. In 1675, {Odda's
{stone,}dedicated to its patron Earl   
 Odda, friend of King Edward the       
 Confessor, was found with Latin and   
 Celtic carved on it. Restoration      
 started in 1933.{Deerhurst Church,}of 
 Saxon origin,is mostly in Gothic style
 and was part of a Benedictine         
 priory,subordinated in 1469 to        
 Tewkesbury Abbey &amp; dissolved in 1540. 
 Today the Priory is a farm and the    
 parish church was restored in 1861.   
 Chaceley Church  has a 12 Century Arch
 with some registers which date from   
 1538. Apperley Church is Victorian.
