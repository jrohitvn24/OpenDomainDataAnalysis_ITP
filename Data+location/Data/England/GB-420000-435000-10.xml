		<title>10THE HORSFORTH MUSIC FESTIVAL</title>
		<content>      The Horsforth Competitive        
 Festival of Music, Drama and Dance has
 now been in existence for forty two   
 years.                                
      The Speech and Drama classes are 
 exceedingly popular and large numbers 
 enter. In the prose speaking class    
 for ten year olds for example there   
 were thirty seven entries in 1985.    
 Other popular classes include Bible   
 reading, verse and Shakespeare        
 reading, and the mime and solo drama  
 classes.                              
      The music section ot the         
 Festival is well patronised with music
 ranging from the recorder up to opera.
 The most popular class in 1985 was the
 cello for sixteen years and under.    
 There are also many entrants for the  
 vocal sections and the dance classes  
 are even more popular. This event now 
 attracts a Yorkshire wide entry.      </content>
