		<title>04THE RIBBLE WAY.</title>
		<content>   All over Britain,through the most   
 beautiful scenery,wind small public   
 footpaths.One recent addition to this 
 nationwide network is the{"Ribble Way"
 It's course stays around the rivers   
{Ribble,Calder}and{Hodder}and passes   
 through the countryside quite near to 
 our School.When completed the total   
 trail will cover about 65 miles.The   
 trail begins at the estuary of the    
 Ribble and continues to the river's   
 source at{Ribblehead}in Yorkshire.    
   In June 1985 15 children and 3      
 teachers from Salesbury School went   
 for a walk on part of the Ribble Way. 
 We covered 10 miles,a small proportion
 of the whole walk,beginning at{Dinckly
 and finishing at{Clitheroe.}This area 
 is densely wooded with deciduous trees
 and is particularly popular with trout
 fishermen.During our walk the Ribble  
 changed levels three times.{          </content>
