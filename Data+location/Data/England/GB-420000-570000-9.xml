		<content> The following information is all about
 the{farmland}in three 12 sq Km area   
 which our group is covering.We have   
 gone over the area and found out what 
 is in each field.Our method of coding 
 was done by giving each field a       
 number and we went around identifying 
 what was in each numbered field.      
 Approximately 90% of the area was used
 agriculturally with only a small      
 proportion used for livestock.The type
 of{crops}grown ranged from turnips to 
 barley and the type of{livestock}kept 
 ranged from chickens to horses.Not    
 much of the land in the grid was      
 disused and about 1Km of the 12Km was 
 taken up by the airport runway and its
 surroundings.We found some of our     
 information by giving the farmers a   
 questionaire with the required        
 questions on it.
