		<title>04Farming around Harberton</title>
		<content> The whole of the area is farmland with
 about half being tenanted farms       
 belonging to one landowner - a remnant
 of the old Estates, the rest being    
 privately owned holdings.             
 It has been traditionally a dairy and 
 livestock area, because of the climate
 (mild damp conditions produce an      
 abundance of good grass) and the      
 rolling, sometimes steep terrain.     
 However recently with modern machinery
 and economic pressures more farms are 
 growing cereal crops.                 
 The farms are generally family run    
 roughly 200 acres on average, normally
 only employing one full/part time     
 worker,with additional student or     
 casual help.Therefore much work is    
 contracted out or expensive farm      
 machinery co-operatively used.
