		<title>16Life in Winston Today (ctd).</title>
		<content> The village has only one shop and     
 Post Office, but this is well-used by 
 the inhabitants.   As many people use 
 the shop as travel to nearby towns to 
 shop in supermarkets.  The vast       
 majority of families in Winston owns a
 car, for many travel to work          
 from Winston, though a significant    
 number, fourteen, works within ten    
 miles of their home. Most homes have  
 central heating, a telephone and a    
 garden.   The majority of households  
 also own a pet, of which over half are
 dogs.  Holidays are planned by 24     
 families for the coming year (1986),  
 fifteen of which intend to holiday in 
 the British Isles.                    
 The village also boasts two active    
 churches. St. Andrew's congregation   
 has many people who come from         
 neighbouring parishes to worshp there.
