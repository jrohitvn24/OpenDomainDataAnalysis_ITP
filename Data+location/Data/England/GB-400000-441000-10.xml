		<title>10REDCAR TARN.</title>
		<content>   Redcar Tarn,or as it is more        
 commonly known,Keighley Tarn is       
 situated on Redcar Lane between       
 Steeton and Keighley.                 
   Formerly the tarn was used for      
 boating as there was a boathouse,which
 has now been demolished,a jetty and a 
 place where canoes were moulded.This  
 has been proved since the rediscovery 
 of three concrete canoe moulds which  
 were built by a Mr. F.Taylor of       
 Keighley in the 1920's.               
   The first canoe mould was discovered
 by a Keighley Artist,Stanley Boardman 
 in late 1972.The following year pupils
 from South Craven School,Cross Hills  
 and teacher Mr.A.Rye searched for the 
 remaining two moulds during the four  
 days of the school Project Week.
