		<content> The landscape to the south of Preston 
 Capes has changed dramatically in the 
 last l0 years. Gone are the elms, due 
 to Dutch Elm disease, and gone are the
 small fields with names - hedgerows   
 have been stipped from the countryside
 to make way for larger fields and farm
 machinery. The buildings in and       
 around Preston Capes have not changed 
 as much. Next to the Manor House the  
 most important and interesting house  
 in the village is the Old School      
 House, recently renovated, which was  
 built around l690. The most unusual   
 properties are Archway Cottges which  
 were built in the l8th century as four
 cottages - now two - for workers from 
 Fawsley House. They have a red brick  
 connecting archway which looks like a 
 castle viewed from Fawsley Park.
