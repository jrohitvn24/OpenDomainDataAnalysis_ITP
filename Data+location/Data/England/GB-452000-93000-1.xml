		<content> The {Swiss Cottage}stands in the      
 grounds of {Osborne House},a former   
 residence of {Queen Victoria          
{(1819-1901).}The Swiss Cottage        
 cost{Â£1000.}The cottage was rebuilt   
 on the site after being transported   
 from Switzerland. It was a present for
 the royal children where they were    
 allowed to play, a sort of Wendy      
 House. There is still a fully fitted  
 house on view to the public, with all 
 the furniture still as it was in      
 Victorian times. There is a fully     
 fitted kitchen where the children     
 learned housekeeping and outside many 
 garden tools with the names of the    
 princes and princesses still on       
 them. Also outside the cottage is an  
 old{bathing machine,}a sort of caravan
 which was wheeled next to the sea so  
 the swimmer would not be seen changing
 or have to walk down to the sea.      </content>
