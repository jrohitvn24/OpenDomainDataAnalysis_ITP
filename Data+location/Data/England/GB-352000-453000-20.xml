		<content> Although this area is very attractive 
 it is rarely visited by tourists      
 except on their way to the Trough of  
 Bowland. Tourism is not encouraged.   
 There are no hotels or guesthouses    
 and only one cottage ever let for     
 holiday bookings. There are no pubs or
 even tea-rooms. On the other hand     
 footpaths are well-marked and used    
 regularly by local ramblers with whom 
 farmers have a good relationship.
