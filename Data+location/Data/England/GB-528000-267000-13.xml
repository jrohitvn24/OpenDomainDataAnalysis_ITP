		<title>13LADYBIRD NURSERY,FENSTANTON</title>
		<content>    The {Nursery}is situated along     
 the{High Street}and was opened by     
 Mrs Crosby.She is a qualified         
 nurse and midwife and lives in        
 Fenstanton.                           
    The {Nursery }takes babies         
 and under school aged children from   
 8am to 5:30pm,those who stay over     
 lunch time, stay to dinner.           
    The{living quarters}of the house   
 were once downstairs as well as       
 upstairs so the{nursery}has more room.
{   Ladybird}is used by mothers,some   
 who live 10 miles away.               
   {In the summer,}if the weather is   
 fine the children play in the garden. 
 They have a wendy house, a climbing   
 frame and plenty of push-along cars   
 as well as a sandpit.                 
    The{Nursery}now has about 36       
 children on some days and about 10    
 people helping.                       </content>
