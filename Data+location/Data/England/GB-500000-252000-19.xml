		<title>19A Day in a Child's Life</title>
		<content> I woke up this morning to find that my
 German Measles spots had gone.   I    
 went downstairs to ask my Mum if I    
 could go to school but she said       
 perhaps tomorrow.   I am so bored     
 staying at home.   But it was nice to 
 be able to play with my Great Shape   
 Barbie Doll which Mum and Dad bought  
 for me for doimg well in my ballet    
 exam.   My Mum played draughts with me
 and that wasn't much fun and she beat 
 me.  My teacher sent some books home  
 to read, so I sat down after lunch and
 I read two of them.   Soon it was time
 for my brother to come home from      
 school, but he didn't want to play    
 with me, he wanted to play with his   
 friends.   Still Dad will be home soon
 and tomorrow I can go to school.   So 
 I will be able to take part in my     
 classes Family Assembly, after all.
