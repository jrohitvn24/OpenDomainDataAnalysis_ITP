		<content>{The Rector}                           
 The hardworking Rector of St. Mary's  
 has the same problems in this         
 community that most rectors of the    
 Church of England have everywhere,    
 acting as pastor to many more people  
 than in previous generations. The     
 Church is used for weddings, baptisms 
 and funerals and for many people that 
 is the extent of their church going.  
 The Rector is trying to make the      
 church and church going more          
 attractive to young people. Apart from
 the regular church services there are 
 many groups organised to encourage    
 people to meet together. There is a   
 Mothers' Union branch, five House     
 Groups for Bible studies, three youth 
 groups called Explorers, Pathfinders  
 and CYFA. There is a pram service for 
 young mothers &amp; babies, a reguar      
 Sunday School &amp; monthly family service</content>
