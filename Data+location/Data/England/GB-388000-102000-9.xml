		<title>09TRAFFIC IN SPETISBURY &amp; C.M.</title>
		<content> A major trunk road, the A35O, passes  
 through both Spetisbury and Charlton  
 Marshall.  This links Poole to the    
 Bristol area and West Midlands.  As   
 well as holiday traffic during the    
 summer, an expansion of the container 
 port at Poole has increased the number
 of large lorries.  Recent road        
 improvements such as the Wimborne  and
 Blandford bypasses also seem to have  
 increased use of the A35O.  Dorset    
 County Council considered using a     
 disused railway line, which runs      
 parallel to the road, as a means of   
 bypassing both villages.  This was    
 dropped from the Dorset Structure Plan
 when residents living close to the    
 railway line objected.  There is a bus
 service to Blandford and Wimborne and 
 Bournemouth, with two buses a day     
 direct to Poole.  Most families find a
 car essential.                        </content>
