		<content>This cluster of houses and a pub are at
the junction of A143 and Church road   
(leading to W'brook) and Denston lane. 
The parish boundary wavers uncertainly 
through the group, so that some houses 
are in W'brook and some in Denston.    
The pub, the Plumbers Arms, is part in 
one parish and part in the other.  It  
is said that you order beer in W'brook 
and they fetch it from Denston.        
In 1985 two thatched cottages were     
burnt down.  One is being restored     
with thatching of Norfolk reeds, the   
other will be replaced by a house with 
tiled roof.  Most of the houses in     
the area are Suffolk "traditional" in  
that the rooms are low and the upper   
rooms within the roof space, with      
dormer windows.
