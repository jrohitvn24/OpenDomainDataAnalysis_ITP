 The villages of Trefonen,Treflach and 
 Nantmawr are mainly farming areas.At  
 one time they were quite industrial,  
 that was when the coal_mines and the  
 quarries were in use.They quarried    
 stone and lime.There used to be a coal
 mine at Trefonen but it is no longer  
 in use.Many of the mounds seen in the 
 fields are old spoil heaps and the    
 coal board still has some parts of the
 parish marked on it's map as possible 
 sources of coal.Some of the larger    
 quarries are still working like ARC.  
 There is one between Treflach and     
 Trefonen that is now used by the      
 council as a tip  and as storage for  
 salt and grit to put on the roads in  
 the winter.
