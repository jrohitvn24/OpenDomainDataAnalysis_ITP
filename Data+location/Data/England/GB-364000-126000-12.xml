		<title>12INTERVIEW-a working farmer</title>
		<content>   A tenant farmer in his middle 30's  
 with a wife and 2 children has lived  
 here all his life.As a boy he recalls 
 5 working farms in and around his     
 village now his is the only one.He    
 remembers a social life centred on the
 village hall and the church,a village 
 alive with children.Now he feels his  
 children are more isolated within     
 their 'community' and far more        
 dependent on their parents for        
 transport and entertainment.          
   He considers the polarization of the
 population to be the greatest change  
 to have taken place.When a boy the    
 villagers were nearly all working on  
 the land.With a reduction of farm     
 units,an increase in unit size and    
 mechanisation man-power requirements  
 have reduced.Thus vacant farm housing 
 has found a new market in retired and 
 better-off people.                    </content>
