		<title>14OUTDOOR RECREATION</title>
		<content> Opportunities for outdoor recreation  
 in Worksop are limited, though close  
 by are several amenities. These       
 include Kilton Hill and Worksop golf  
 courses, several playing fields and   
 parks.                                
                                       
 Worksop Town has a thriving football  
 team (the Tigers) playing in the      
 Northern League. There are two cricket
 grounds, one in the town and the other
 in Clumber Park.                      
                                       
 Worksop is, however, within easy reach
 of Sherwood Forest and the Rother     
 Valley Country Park with its water    
 sports facilities.
