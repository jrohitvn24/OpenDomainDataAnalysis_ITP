     In Wrotham recreation ground there
 are six swings,a roundabout,a slide,  
 a log swing and a maypole swing.Many  
 of these sounded as if they could do  
 with a drop of oil.The slide needed a 
 new coat of paint.The two panels      
 either side of the top of the slide   
 were loose.The log swing and the other
 wooden swings had graffiti cut into   
 them.Placed around the park were five 
 benches,four were metal and one was   
 wooden.The wooden one was vandalized  
     The recreation ground also has    
 a combined hockey,tennis and five-a-  
 side football pitch.The fence         
 surrounding this area needed some     
 repairs,but the court itself was in   
 good condition.This area was floodlit 
     Although the the park is in       
 a pleasant setting it is rather close 
 to the M 20 and can be noisy.         </content>
