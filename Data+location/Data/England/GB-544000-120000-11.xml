		<title>11COPWOOD FARM.</title>
		<content>   {Mr Tebbitt},the owner of{Copwood   
{Farm}has sent us an interesting       
 letter.Here is the part that explains 
 how the new road scheme is affecting  
 him.                                  
                                       
    "It sounds terrible to say this but
 I have completely ceased farming for a
 year while the{by-pass}road, round    
 about and link road are pushed through
 Copwood. There are no animals except a
 couple of horses on the farm, and no  
 crops except grass until everything   
 settles down again. My replies to your
 questionnaire would at the moment be  
 completely different to what normally 
 happens on a normal farm."            
                                       
    Mr Tebbitt has been in America for 
 some of this time. He ia obviously    
 looking forward to getting back to    
 normal.                               </content>
