		<title>18  THE OLD RAILWAY LINE</title>
		<content>   There is a disused railway track    
 running through a small part of our   
 area.It was started in 1863 and took  
 over five years to be built.The       
 railway line was a single line which  
 ran from Braintree to Dunmow and then 
 to Bishops Stortford.                 
   In the early part of the 19th       
 century some farmers used to buy Welsh
 cattle for summer grazing they were   
 then put on to a truck at the station 
 to be driven by rail to North Essex   
 and Suffolk.During the first world war
 alot of hay was brought by wagon and  
 traction engine for the military.The  
 soldiers used to help put the hay on  
 to the wagons.                        
   As the times changed and people got 
 other kinds of transport the railway  
 line closed down in 1952 and the      
 tracks were taken up in 1970. Today   
 people use the old track as a walk.   </content>
