 Red Poison is a game in which someone 
 holds out a hand (with fingers apart) 
 and other children hold on to a       
 finger. The person who holds out their
 hand tells a story, and somewhere in  
 that story they have to say "Red      
 Poison!" When they say it the people  
 who are holding the fingers run away  
 and the other person chases and       
 catches them. Then you start again    
 with the person whom they caught.     
            RED ROVER                  
 Red Rover is a game in which you have 
 two teams, which stand opposite each  
 other. One team says "Red Rover, Red  
 Rover send   ?  over" and then that   
 person runs over to the other team and
 tries to break through their hands. If
 he fails he has to join the other     
 team. If he does break through he is  
 allowed to return to his own team.    </content>
