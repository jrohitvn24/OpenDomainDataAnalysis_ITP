		<content> IN AN OLD BOOK THERE IS A STORY ABOUT 
 AN OLD MAN WHO CARRIES HIS HEAD UNDER 
 HIS ARM AND IF ANYONE GOES DOWN BY    
 SALDEN POND ON A VERY DARK NIGHT HE   
 WILL FOLLOW HIM TO A CERTAIN POINT    
 DOWN THE LANE AND IF ANYONE FOLLOWS   
 HIM HE IS SUPPOSED TO LEAD THEM TO A  
 POT OF GOLD.THE GHOST IS DRESSED IN AN
 OLD FASHIONED UNIFORM AND IS SUPPOSED 
 TO BE A SOLDIER FROM THE WARS OF THE  
 ROSES WHICH WERE FOUGHT AT SALDEN.    
   THERE IS ALSO A STORY ABOUT SOME    
 COACHES FILLED WITH FUNNY PEOPLE GOING
 LIKE A WHIRLWIND THROUGH SALDEN WOOD  
 "CLUTTERING" UP STONES AND DUST.WE    
 ASKED THE PRESENT OWNER IF SHE HAS    
 EVER SEEN THESE THINGS BUT SHE SAID   
 SHE NEVER HAS ALTHOUGH SHE OFTEN GETS 
 A FEELING WHEN SHE WALKS IN A CERTAIN 
 FIELD,THIS IS NOT A FRIGHTENING       
 EXPERIENCE THOUGH.
