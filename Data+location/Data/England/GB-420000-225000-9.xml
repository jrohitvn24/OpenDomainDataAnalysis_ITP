		<content>{Evenlode Grounds:}The 80 hectares of  
 permanent wet grassland at Evenlode   
 Grounds has been owned and farmed by  
 the same family for 200 years. Much of
 this managed grassland is ridge and   
 furrow. Clay from the 'Brick Field'   
 was used to make the bricks to build  
 the farmhouse. A Friesian dairy herd  
 store cattle, and some sheep, are fed 
 in winter on home-made silage and hay 
 with bought 'dairy nuts'. Manure is   
 spread on the grass. The family run   
 the farm with some casual help.       
 Contractors cut the hedges. There is a
 computerised milking parlour. Milk    
 tankers take the milk to Kidlington,  
 near Oxford, Stock goes to Banbury    
 market or is sold on the farm to      
 dealers. Paddocks in other villages   
 are rented for grass keep for the     
 stock.
