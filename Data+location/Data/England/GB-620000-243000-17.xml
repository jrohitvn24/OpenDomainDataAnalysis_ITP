   In  my  spare  time I ride  my bike,
play with a ball,  play  tennis,  read,
write or draw pictures.  I play with my
marbles  and  my  dolls,   or  with  my
cassette recorder, or I play games like
 Guess  Who',  'Scrabble'  or  Â£Chinese
Checkers'.   Sometimes I sing songs  or
play noughts and crosses.              
   I also go swimming,  play in my back
garden or call  for  my friends and ask
if they are allowed to play. Then we do
running  and  gymnastics  and my sister
gives me points.                       
   I sometimes play  with  my  sister's
Â£play dough' but  mostly  I  do  sports
activities or I read books.            
   At  school  I  play  games,  Â£It' or
Â£Eggy  Peggy'  or   Â£Stick in the Mud'.
I play with my  friends  in  the  play-
ground and I think it is fun.
