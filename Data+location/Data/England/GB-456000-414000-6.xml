		<content> The land around{Moss and Fenwick}was  
 wetland. The soil is mainly clay. It  
 has been drained and now is fertile   
 and used for{crops}such as wheat,     
 oats, cereal, beans, linseed oil rape,
 potatoes, barley, peas and roots.There
 is also pasture land around the farms 
 and villages. There are also{farm     
{animals}like beef cattle, dairy       
 cows, horses, pigs and hens with dogs 
 to help and cats for rodent control.  
 There are{18 farms}in our area. Most  
 of the 18 farms have not been         
 modernised for the past 20 years. A   
 lot of the families have been farming 
 there for over 50 years, and one      
 family for over 200 years. 3 farms are
 entirely arable, 1 farm breeds horses,
 and the other farms have mixed        
 farming.
