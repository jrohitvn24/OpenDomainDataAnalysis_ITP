		<content> On Monday I woke up at 7 am. and      
 washed my hair, dressed and had a     
 small bowl of Shreddies. Then I walked
 up to the coach stop at the top end   
 of Court Hill and caught the school   
 coach at 8.10.                        
 After arriving at school I went into  
 registration and collected all the    
 physics home work books, which were   
 taken to the laboratory. After that we
 lined up for Assembly, during which   
 the Headmaster talked about the school
 fete.                                 
 Afterwards we went to our first       
 lesson - Art with Miss Phelps, where  
 we drew "Spot the Difference"         
 pictures.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
