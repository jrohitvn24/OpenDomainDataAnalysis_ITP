 The whole of N.Sussex and S.Surrey has
 had to cope with an increased         
 population of over 120,000.Our area   
 has had to find new dwellings for over
 8,000.In 1970 it was decided to build 
 an estate on some rough grazing land  
 previously belonging to the Herontyre 
 Estate.A plan was produced in Oct.1973
 which put aside 149 acres for 3,900   
 people and 80 acres for 2,300.This    
 plan was accepted by the government.  
 A main distributor road was the       
 backbone of the plan, joining Lewes   
 Road with Dunnings Road.No building   
 was allowed until "adequate access    
 roads" were built.Building was meant  
 to finish in 1978 but a new area was  
 started in 1984-the Lower Mere estate.
