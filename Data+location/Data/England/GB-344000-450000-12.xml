		<content> The club was formed in 1905, land was 
 rented from Crookhey Hall estate and  
 members constructed a bowling green.In
 1926 the estate was sold and the      
 bowling green was given to the        
 club.The green has been used          
 continuously since opening except for 
 the 1939-45 period.The club was       
 reformed in 1946.Membership has       
 gradually increased and today there   
 are over 60 members,men and women with
 ages ranging from 16 - 75             
 years.Maintenance and improvements    
 have been carried out by the          
 membership including the installation 
 of floodlights.The club has six teams 
 playing weekly from April to          
 September.The playing area is         
 surrounded by boarders of shrubs and  
 flowers and is a very pleasant place  
 to spend a few hours relaxation.
