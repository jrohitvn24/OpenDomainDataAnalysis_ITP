		<title>08HORTICULTURE (NEWICK AREA)</title>
		<content> Horticulture has for many years been a
 feature of Newick life. With the      
 decline in hop growing at the end of  
 the last century, market gardening and
 soft fruit growing was introduced. A  
 wide variety of vegetables and fruits 
 were grown. Strawberries, raspberries 
 and the famous Newick Leveller goose- 
 berries flourished. This industry is  
 however already on the decline, as    
 such perishable goods are now trans-  
 ported easily and more cheaply from   
 abroad. A new industry has developed, 
 that of selling the excellent,        
 disease-free strawberry plants to     
 Italy, France and Spain. The plants   
 are lifted in March and stored in     
 freezers at exactly -1 degree         
 centigrade, ready for export.
