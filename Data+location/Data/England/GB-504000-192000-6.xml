		<content> MOOR PARK MANSION was built for James,
 Duke of Monmouth in 1678-9 and        
 reconstructed in the Palladian style  
 in 1720. It is now owned by Three     
 Rivers Council and they lease it to   
 the Moor Park Golf Club for their     
 Clubhouse.During the Second World War 
 it was the Headquarters of the 1st.   
 British Airborne Corps where the      
 Arnhem Raid was planned. There are    
 three golf courses (one of which is   
 municipal).For many years it has been 
 tthe site of the Bob Hope Golf        
 Tournament.                           
   In Rickmansworth there is a 19th.   
 century Baptist Church (with          
 interesting Wayside Pulpit messages)  
 and a Roman Catholic Church. The      
 Methodist Church (with stained glass  
 windows) was pulled down last year and
 replaced by offices. The nearest      
 Mosque is being built in Slough.      </content>
