		<content>{Wood Brothers:}Ware is famed for its  
 very large bed,supposedly made for    
 Edward IV.A replica of the bed is one 
 of the items of reproduction furniture
 made by{Wood Bros.}Originally founded 
 in Shoreditch 60 years ago the company
 now has a workforce of 125 and makes  
 furniture which is sold worldwide.    
      English oak is no longer used as 
 it is too expensive and difficult to  
 work.New furniture is designed by Mr. 
 Wood and made up at the factory.      
{Concrete Utilities:}Established in    
 1925 by Mr.Marks this company         
 originally made concrete paving and   
 kerb stones.Ware was chosen because of
 its proximity to gravel pits.Today    
 metal is used rather than concrete    
 because of cost.The company makes     
 lamps for street and road             
 lighting,airports,bridges,railways and
 harbours.                             </content>
