		<content>    MY FAVOURITE HOBBY IS{B.M.X.RACING.
 B.M.X. RACING STARTED IN AMERICA ABOUT
 FOUR YEARS AGO.  B.M.X. BIKES ARE     
 DIFFERENT FROM ORDINARY BIKES BECAUSE 
 THEY ARE MUCH STRONGER. THEY ALSO HAVE
 PROTECTIVE PADS ON THE STEM, CROSSBAR 
 AND HANDLEBARS. THEY ARE LIGHTER THAN 
 NORMAL BIKES BECAUSE THEY ARE MADE    
 OF  AN AIRCRAFT ALLOY THEN DIPPED INTO
 A CHROME COATING. THEY HAVE A POINTED 
 PLASTIC SEAT WHICH IS LIGHTER. STRONG 
 WHEELS HELP A LOT.{B.M.X. MEANS       
{'BICYCLE MOTOCROSS'.}THE TRACK        
 CONSISTS OF A STARTING GATE WITH      
 SEPARATE STARTING LANES FOR EACH      
 RIDER.A"WHOOP" COMES NEXT (A SMALL    
 HUMP)THEN A CORNER CALLED A "BERM"    
 THEN A "CAMEL" (WHICH IS TWO BIG HUMPS
 TOGETHER). AFTER THAT COMES "A BERM"  
 THEN A"TABLETOP"(ONE BIG HUMP         
 WITH A FLAT TOP).LASTLY THE "DOUBLE   
 WHOOPS"THEN THE FINISHING LINE.       </content>
