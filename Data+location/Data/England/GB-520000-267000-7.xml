		<title>07Buckden Cruel Tree</title>
		<content> In the olden days if you committed    
 suicide or murder you couldn't be     
 buried in the churchyard.You were     
 buried at crossroads &amp; if possible by 
 the parish boundary because some      
 people believed that they might become
{earthbound ghosts}&amp; this would confuse
 them.To make it safer they  put a     
 wooden stake between their bones.If it
 rooted and became a tree the ghost    
 couldn't move.It is believed this     
 happened at Buckden.Records show that 
 the tree was cut down in 1865.        
                                       
 A rather curious story started in     
 Cluny Manor House.A lady reading saw  
{an old lady}pass and disappear.She    
 found out that every new bride had    
 seen her.She{welcomed}the brides to   
 the Manor.                            
                                       
                                       </content>
