		<title>16INTERVIEWING MR MITCHELL</title>
		<content> We interviewed Mr Mitchell who lives  
 in the village shop in Frant. He gets 
 a lot of customers a day, he gets     
 roughly 25O a day.  His local         
 customers come from out Tunbridge     
 Wells way, Wadhurst and Mark Cross so 
 he gets a good few customers. He      
 delivers about 17OO papers a week. He 
 sells mostly milk, he has two or three
 crates a day. Mr Mitchell enjoys his  
 work very much, and has a lot of      
 friends. He thinks the reaction of his
 customers would be terrible if the    
 shop closed down luckily his shop has 
 never been broken into, and he has    
 very few complaints about the food he 
 sells and he has a good reputation.
