  Our area is North East Worcester.The 
 housing is a mixture of council houses
 and private houses with a portion of  
 shops and factories.We take up a bit  
 of the city centre but we do not      
 include the cathedral.Our area is     
 largely built up but there are several
 open spaces.The open spaces are       
 Perdiswell sports ground,Astwood      
 cemetery, King Georges                
 field,Pitchcroft Race Course,Leopard  
 Hill Golf Course,Tolladine,a little   
 bit of Northwick and Gheluvelt Park.  
 There is the Worcester to Birmingham  
 canal running through our area from   
 the River Severn, North East.We have  
 got several factories and trading     
 estates.It is an area that has quite a
 few contrasts between old and new and 
 between open spaces and built up      
 areas.                                </content>
