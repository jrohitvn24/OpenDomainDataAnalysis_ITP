		<title>15BENENDEN WEALD, FERTILISERS</title>
		<content> Forest Farm is mainly second grade    
 land with some third grade, it        
 therefore needs much fertiliser.They  
 have always had a manure spreader but 
 the spreader is now automatic.In the  
 winter they use a compound fertiliser 
 as well. Soil samples are taken       
 frequently by the Ministry of         
 Agriculture.One fertiliser they use is
 24 units of potash and 24 units of    
 phosphorus. Scrapers are used to clear
 the cow sheds, these work every four  
 hours day and night.The scrapers are a
 very efficient and effective way of   
 cleaning the sheds. The manure goes to
 a large slurry pit and the slurry is  
 put on the stubble in the fields after
 harvest.The farm shows the use of     
 natural as well as artificial         
 fertilisers.
