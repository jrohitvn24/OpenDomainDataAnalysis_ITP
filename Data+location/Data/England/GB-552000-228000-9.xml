		<title>09M11 Motorway by Henham</title>
		<content> At Elsenham M11 motorway bridge there 
 are two lanes to Cambridge and two    
 lanes to London. In 20 minutes in May 
 1985 we counted 319 vehicles going to 
 London and 292 going to Cambridge this
 was from 11am.The M11 motorway was    
 started in 1975.The M11 goes from     
 London past Cambridge to Huntingdon.  
 The nearest access north from Henham  
 is at Duxford and the nearest access  
 south from Henham is Bishops Stortford
 The M11 in our area goes for 3.6km and
 lies between Henham and Ugley.The M11 
 was built because ofthe large amount  
 of traffic going to and from Stansted 
 Airport which will increase now that  
 Stansted Airport is to be developed.
