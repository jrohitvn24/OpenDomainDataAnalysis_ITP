 I am an eight year old boy. I have    
 many different clothes for different  
 occasions. In winter I wear warm      
 woolly clothes such as trousers and   
 jumpers. In summer I wear shorts and a
 T shirt. When I go swimming I wear    
 trunks which are like shorts. At bed  
 time I wear pyjamas.                  
 I am an eight year old girl. When I go
 to parties I wear my party dress and  
 my red shoes. In the garden I wear my 
 T shirt and my skirt and my green     
 trainers. Trainers are like exercise  
 shoes. At night I wear a nightie but I
 also have pyjamas. For swimming I wear
 a costume or bikini.
