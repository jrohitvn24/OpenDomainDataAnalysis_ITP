		<title>03Looking at Milton Common (2)</title>
		<content>  On Friday we went for a walk at      
Milton Common.We had to count how many 
houses,bungalows,garages &amp; hotels there
were.I saw 14 houses,2 bungalows,      
1 garage and a County Council Depot.   
There was an unfinished house as well. 
Most of the houses were modern and made
of brick with tiles on their roof.The  
unfinished house was having its tiles  
put on its roof.                       
  It was very noisy because the M40 was
just behind the Council Depot's fence. 
The cars went very fast along the A40  
London Road where we were walking and  
we had to remember our Green X Code.   
Another group was looking at the other 
part of Milton Common.
