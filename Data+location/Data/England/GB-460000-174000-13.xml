 the area. The smaller is St. Andrew's 
 school. It is situated in 54 acres to 
 the west of Tidmarsh. There are 90    
 pupils and 15 teachers. It opened in  
 1934. Previously the building was part
 of an estate belonging to the Watleys,
 who owned bakeries, breweries,        
 gasworks and waterworks. The estate   
 was sold off in lots in 1934.         
   Pangbourne College was built as a   
 marine training centre. In 1917 it    
 became a boys' school. In the past    
 many pupils joined the Merchant Navy. 
 In the late sixties and early         
 seventies more buildings were added.  
 The school has around 360 pupils, some
 of whom are boarders. Fees are Â£1,225 
 for senior boarders. There are 28     
 teachers. The school covers 240 acres 
 of ground,partly woodland.In 1985,
