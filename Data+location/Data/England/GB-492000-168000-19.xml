		<content>{VIRGINIA WATER LAKE:                  
 Virginia  Water Lake is owned by the  
 Queen. Ducks and fish live there.     
 Anyone is allowed to walk round the   
 lake. We go there to walk the dog and 
 for picnics. There is a waterfall at  
 one end and  a bridge at the other.   
 A huge totem pole given to the{Queen  
 by Canadian Indians stands on the     
 northern bank. Lots of azaleas and    
 specimen trees  grow round the lake.  
 In  winter the long grass slopes make 
 good sledging runs. There are car     
 parks at each entrance. It is 4 miles 
 round.                                
 There are 65 gardeners in the{Great   
{Park.}The park pale is an old ditch   
 which formed the boundary of Windsor  
 Great Park. They plant pine trees and 
 when they reach a good size they are  
 cut down and sold.
