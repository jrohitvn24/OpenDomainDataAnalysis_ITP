		<content>   The area has undulating land with   
 narrow twisty roads on the north coast
 of Cornwall. The main rock basis is   
 made of granite and slate. There is   
 quite a lot of woodland, but mainly   
 farmland dealing with mostly grass,   
 some cereals and mixed farming. There 
 are two inns; one in the old village  
 by the fifteenth century church and   
 another in St. Kew Highway. There is a
 school on a hill about one and a half 
 miles from there. In this area there  
 are council houses and private houses.
 There are very few men who work in the
 area and live in it. There are several
 hamlets around the village and lots of
 holiday cottages. There are no sports'
 facilities in the village.
