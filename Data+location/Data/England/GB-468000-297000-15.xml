		<content> The Parish is bounded and crossed by  
 two very ancient roads, the Gartree   
 Road and the Durassic Way. At the t-  
 junction in the centre of the village 
 is a small triangular green on which  
 is planted a mountain ash tree to     
 commemorate the coronation of Queen   
 Elizabeth II.  The parish is not      
 heavily wooded except for the trees   
 which shelter the village, a small    
 spinney at Carlton Clump, Sheephorns, 
 fox cover, a plantation on the south  
 of the Hall.  Several fox earths are  
 to be found around the parish and all 
 types of wild life.  There is a       
 telephone box and post box in the     
 village.  There are no shops or       
 schools in the village.  Children go  
 by school bus to Church Langton at    
 primary school age and to Kibworth and
 Market Harborough Secondary schools.
