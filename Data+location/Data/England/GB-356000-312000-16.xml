		<title>16A SCHOOLBOY'S DAY</title>
		<content> MY DAY STARTS AT 7 O'CLOCK WHEN I GET 
 OUT OF BED AND GET WASHED AND DRESSED.
 I FEED MY DOG, SPICE AND I FEED THE   
 HENS WITH POTATOES.  THEN I GO DOWN TO
 THE FARM TO SEE MY NAN AND MY AUNT. IF
 I HAVE TIME I WILL EAT MY BREAKFAST. I
 GO ON MY BIKE TO SCHOOL AT QUARTER TO 
 9. SCHOOL STARTS AT 9 O'CLOCK AND     
 FINISHES AT 3.30.  WE HAVE THREE      
 PLAYTIMES, ONE AT HALF PAST 10, ONE   
 AFTER DINNER UNTIL 1 O'CLOCK AND ONE  
 AT QUARTER PAST 2.  WE CAN HAVE THE   
 P.E. EQUIPMENT OUT AT PLAYTIME.  IN   
 THE LONG DINNER PLAYTIME I MOSTLY PLAY
 ROUNDERS. WHEN I GET HOME I GO AND    
 SEE MY NAN AND MY AUNT DOWN AT THE    
 FARM AND I HELP THEM UNTIL 6 O'CLOCK. 
 THEN I PLAY WITH MY BROTHER AND THEN I
 WATCH T.V.  I GO TO BED AT 9 O'CLOCK. 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
