 The A25l (Ashford-Faversham) is the   
 main road through the area.  The bus  
 service is minimal and sparsely used  
 although constant reduction in the    
 service heavily penalises the few who 
 rely on it.  On each weekday, 6 buses 
 and on Saturdays, 3 buses, operate    
 each way operated by the National Bus 
 Company. (Single fare Ashford to      
 Faversham Â£l.45; Return Â£2.3O).  There
 are no buses on Sunday.  Most         
 households in this rural area have a  
 car.  Many families have two cars to  
 allow the wife freedom to shop and    
 transport children to and from school.
 Bicycles are used mainly for pleasure.
 There is no footpath along the busy   
 A25l between Leaveland and Badlesmere 
 which makes walking hazardous.  Train 
 travellers have the choice of travel  
 from either Faversham or Charing Stn. </content>
