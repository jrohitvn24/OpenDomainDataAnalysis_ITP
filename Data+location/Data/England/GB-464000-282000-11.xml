 are three instruments,the piano,organ

 in the church, before we used to use  
 oil lamps and candles.The Rev H.O New_
 man who used to look after Husbands_

 church clock was restored in 1983 by  
 G.A Armitage.We also had a new alter_ 
 native service book in 1980.One of the
 stained glass windows is of the heal_ 
 ing of the paralysed man.The font is  
 used for christenings and the altar is
