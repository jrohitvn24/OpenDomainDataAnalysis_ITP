 The{Long Mynd}is mainly covered with  
 bracken and moss,parts of it are grass
 in some places there are bare rocks.It
 is all hilly and mountainous.There are
 sheep running over the Long Mynd in   
 the summer and there is the odd farm  
 or two scattered around,but the Long  
 Mynd is mostly used as a{tourist }    
 attraction.There is a{reservoir}in one
 of the valleys in the Long Mynd which 
 used to give water to Church Stretton.
 There are not many roads and most of  
 them are not very wide or well built. 
 Most of the Long Mynd is owned by the 
{National Trust}the Long Mynd is       
 situated near Church Stretton.
