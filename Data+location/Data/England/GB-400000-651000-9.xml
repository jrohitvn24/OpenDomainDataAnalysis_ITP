 like a sundial.Flat roof gives church 
 an unusual appearance but two small   
 towers added in 1855.Called  the      
 Pepperpots.One tower holds a small    
 bell.Footscrapers at each side of     
 door.No burials for 100 yrs as        
 graveyard was full.Very old           
 gravestones removed because           
 dangerous.Garden of Remembrance now   
 used for burial of ashes- names of    
 people buried there in large book     
 inside church.Inscribed on pillars of 
 gates is name of William Temple-Mayor 
 of Berwick in 1753 when Town Hall was
