		<title>11LIFE AT HOLME FARM,CLAYPOLE</title>

       I then asked my father about the
 work on Holme Farm.                   
       The busiest time of the year is 
 summer and autumn. He harvests the    
 crops and plants next year's seeds.   
 During the winter he looks after the  
 cattle in the sheds. Another winter   
 job is repairing the machinery for    
 next year's harvest. In the spring he 
 turns out the cattle and applies      
 chemicals and fertiliser to the       
 growing crops.                        
       Lastly I asked him about the    
 farm and how it has changed. He said  
 it had changed a lot. The farm has    
 less men, more machinery, more        
 chemicals and fertiliser and bigger   
 fields. This is because many of the   
 hedges have been ripped out a current 
 trend that is being reversed for      
 ecological reasons.                   </content>
