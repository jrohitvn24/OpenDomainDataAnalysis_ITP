		<content>{Holy Trinity Church}was originally a  
 Norman building and you can see the   
 Norman arches inside. It was restored 
 and extended in the nineteenth        
 century. It has stained glass windows 
 which were all put in since 1900 and a
 stone pulpit. An unusual feature is   
 the ugly carving of a man with bulging
 eyes and protruding teeth on the North
 wall of the East aisle.               
{Rangeworthy Court}was built as a      
 country house in the seventeenth      
 century. It is now a restaurant and   
 hotel.                                
{The school}was built in about 1870 of 
 stone with a slate roof.              
{The Rose and Crown Inn}dates from     
 about 1860 and was built on the site  
 of an older inn which sold cider.     
{The old vicarage}was built in about   
 1860 and is now a private residence.
