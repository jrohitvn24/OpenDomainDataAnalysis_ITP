		<content>      Some birds are big and somebirds 
 are small. Some birds feed off worms, 
 nuts, insects and scraps of food which
 people have put out in nets or on     
 their lawns. Some put bread out for   
 birds in Winter because they can't    
 find any food because of the  cold    
 snow.                                 
      There are a lot of different     
 kinds of birds in our area. The       
 black-bird is one of the most         
 common birds in our area. It is cruel 
 to collect birds eggs. If you are     
 caught stealing a rare birds egg you  
 can be fined up to Â£300, as wild birds
 are now protected by law.             
      Many summer visitors can be seen,
 including the swallow, cuckoo and     
 swift.
