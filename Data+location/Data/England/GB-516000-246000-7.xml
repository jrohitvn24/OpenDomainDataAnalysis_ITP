		<title>07The railway today</title>
		<content> The writer often made the journey from
 Newcastle to Bedford via Sandy in the 
 late 1950's and early 1960's and      
 sometimes spent an hour waiting for a 
 connection. The stations shared one   
 island platform and also had one      
 facing platform each.                 
 After closure of the Bedford line, the
 island platform was eventually        
 demolished and the main lines widened 
 to four tracks as they already were   
 both north and south of Sandy station.
 The new up platform (for London) was  
 built for the easternmost tracks.     
 The L.N.W.R. goods yard is used for   
 non railway traffic today but a siding
 still exists on the site of the G.N.R.
 yard, serving U.K.F. Fertiliser depot.
