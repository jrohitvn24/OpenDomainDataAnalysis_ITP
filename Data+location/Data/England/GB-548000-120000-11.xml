		<title>11My Dad's Day</title>
		<content>   My dad's name is Barry.He works with
 a company that cleans carpets.On a    
 work day he has to get up at 6.30.    
 Then he gets washed and dressed and   
 comes down stairs ready for breakfast.
 He has cornflakes followed by tea and 
 toast. Then he gets into the car and  
 heads for work. He arrives at 8.30.   
   He gets phone calls from his clients
 every minute of the day. He often     
 leaves the office to go and see a     
 client.                               
   At lunch_time if he is not too busy 
 he will go to the pub and have lunch. 
 After lunch he is busy again with     
 phone calls, meetings and visits.     
 He has to pay the wages on Thursdays  
 and Fridays so he is sometimes late   
 home. Usually though he is home in    
 time to have dinner with us in the    
 evening.                              
                                       </content>
