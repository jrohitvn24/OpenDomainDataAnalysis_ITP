		<content> Park Farm rears bull beef. We saw them
 in the very large cattle shed. They   
 were black and white and looked very  
 well although one was in a pen on its 
 own with stiff shoulders - it was     
 hoped that it would recover.          
 There are about 150 on the farm at any
 one time between 10 weeks and one year
 old. They are bought in from the West 
 Country - a grass growing area unlike 
 Norfolk, reared at Long Sratton and   
 come to Park Farm at 10 weeks.        
 The bull calves are fed chopped maize,
 beef nuts and minerals. An            
 experimental group are fed on beef    
 nuts only - they are growing faster.  
 The shed used to be full of cows, the 
 milking parlour is still there but Mr 
 Alston went out of milk three years   
 ago.
