		<content> On the edge of the village there are 4
 farms.Behind the car park is a tennis 
 court and beyond that are the         
 grounds of Ingleborough Hall.This     
 was once the home of the Lord of the  
 Manor of Clapham,but is now a         
 residential centre for field studies  
 and outdoor activities.It is used     
 mainly by children from the cities.   
 The village hall has a central        
 position,but the school stands at the 
 south end of the village.             
 To the north there are woods which    
 have a nature trail running through   
 the middle.There are 5 new houses in  
 the nether regions of the village.They
 were built by the Joseph Rowntree     
 Trust in 1984,and there are more to be
 built nearby.These homes are for first
 time buyers.
