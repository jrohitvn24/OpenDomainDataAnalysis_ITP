		<content> The Wheelwright Arms Public House is  
 the only public place of entertainment
 in the map reference area. Darts and  
 Cribbage groups are based here and the
 Wheelwright Handbell Ringers, who     
 perform at local events, were formed  
 here. Recreation and entertainment is 
 organised almost exclusively by those 
 living in the area and centres in     
 Pencombe Parish Hall. The Pencombe    
 Fete Committee meet regularly to      
 arrange events including the Fete,    
 Quizzes, Rounders Matches and Skittles
 evenings. Occasionally concerts are   
 held in St.John's church.             
 Various country hobbies are enjoyed   
 such as shooting, gardening, walking, 
 cycling and horse riding. Recently    
 a Chess Club has been formed by a     
 local man in the area. The North      
 Hereford Hunt meet occasionally at The
 Wheelwright Arms.                     </content>
