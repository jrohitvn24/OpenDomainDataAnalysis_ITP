		<content> MILLOM IS ON THE ESTUARY OF THE RIVER 
 DUDDON. IT IS ABOUT A MILE WIDE BEFORE
 IT REACHES THE SEA. FOOTPATHS ARE     
 MARKED ACROSS THE SANDS AND YEARS AGO 
 THERE WERE GUIDES TO TAKE YOU ACROSS  
 AND IT WAS A MAIN ROUTE.  NOWADAYS FEW
 PEOPLE CROSS THE SANDS. FISHERMEN GO  
 OUT TO CATCH FLATFISH. THE TIDE COMES 
 IN VERY FAST AND THERE ARE DEEP       
 CHANNELS AND SINKING SANDS TO TRAP    
 PEOPLE.  THERE IS AN EMBANKMENT ALONG 
 THE LENGTH OF THE ESTUARY TO ACT AS A 
 FLOOD BARRIER.  SHEEP ARE GRAZED ON   
 THE SALTINGS. BOTH THE ROAD AND THE   
 RAILWAY HAVE TO GO A LONG WAY ROUND.  
 IT IS ABOUT 20 MILES BY ROAD TO THE   
 VILLAGE DIRECTLY OPPOSITE. THERE HAVE 
 BEEN MANY PLANS TO BUILD A BRIDGE     
 STRAIGHT ACROSS BUT THEY HAVE NEVER   
 BEEN CARRIED OUT.                     
                                       
                                       </content>
