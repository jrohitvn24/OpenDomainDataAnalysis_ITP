		<content> The{Promenade}was built in 1912 and is
 overlooked by the Belsfield Hotel.    
 In{Queen's Square}two trees were      
 planted at the turn of the century,   
 called Martha and Mary,however only   
 one survives.                         
{                                      
{St Martin's}Church was built in the   
 15th Cent.{Laurel Cottage(1613)}was   
 the first school in Bowness. This was 
 eventually succeeded by the building  
 just behind in 1867 which in turn was 
 closed in 1975 when the new{Goodly    
{Dale County Primary School}was opened.
 This in its turn has been threatened  
 with closure recently.                
                                       
 More recently a new shopping precinct 
 has been developed on Lake Rd,called  
 the{Quarry Rigg Precinct.
