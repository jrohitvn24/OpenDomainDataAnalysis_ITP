 I interviewed Councillor Plant about  
 his work as Chairman of Church Lawton 
 Parish Council.                       
 He was asked to involve himself in    
 Parish Council work, because of his   
 connection with the P.T.A and Village 
 Hall Committees. He has been Chairman 
 for the last 13 years, and receives no
 payment for this work. He receives    
 much pleasure from his various        
 activities, in seeing all             
 organisations working together for the
 Village Fete. All this work gives     
 little time for relaxation.           
 As to the future he would like better 
 playing fields, including an Amenity  
 Centre where the council Depot yard is
 now situated. Also a litter free      
 village would be desirable to the     
 whole community.
