		<title>12THE AVON AND STOUR VALLEYS</title>
		<content> The majority of the land in the       
 Christchurch area is fairly low and   
 flat,indeed about 80% comes into this 
 category. The highest point is St.    
 Catherine's Hill which reaches a      
 height of only 41.5 metres at its     
 summit.The north-eastern side, which  
 leads down to the Avon valley, is the 
 steepest. The hill is about 2kms. long
 and 1 km. wide. In the Avon valley    
 there are a large number of meanders  
 and artificial drainage channels,     
 which criss-cross the wide floodplain.
 The Stour valley to the west of the   
 hill also has a wide floodplain but,  
 unlike the Avon, has few drainage     
 channels. Both valleys are used       
 predominantly for the growing of grass
 , either as hay or pasture. The       
 landuse changes southwards with an    
 increase in the amount of the         
 floodplain which is used for leisure. </content>
