		<title>05Shopping in St.Helens</title>
		<content> In the centre of St.Helens there are  
 three large shopping precincts,the La 
 Grange Arcade,St.Mary's Arcade and the
 Hardshaw Centre.Roger La Grange was   
 the mayor of Chalon in France when the
 Arcade was opened.As Chalon was a town
 twinned with St.Helens the mayor was  
 invited to lay the foundation stone   
 and to give his name to the arcade.   
    People travel in to the town centre
 from miles around.Each of the         
 precincts has a large area set aside  
 for car parking,with an extra large   
 car park within a few minutes walk.   
    There are still many "corner-shops"
 where people can buy their goods.It is
 a good idea in case people forget     
 things when they are in town or are   
 unable to get to town.
