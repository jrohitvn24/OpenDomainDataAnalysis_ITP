		<title>01Farmland around Sawdon</title>
		<content> Mainly flattish rolling farmland on   
 the southern edge of the North York   
 Moors National park as it gives way to
 the intensively farmed Vale of        
 Pickering. Mainly arable farmland     
 quite varied with many hedgerows and  
 trees so quite pleasant scenery. The  
 north borders on the large forestry   
 coniferous plantations of Wykham      
 forest as wellas deciduous woods along
 Sawdon Beck. The south west around    
 Wydale Hall is also deciduous woods,  
 and parkland. There are two small     
 villages, Sawdon and Ruston which are 
 small, mainly farming communities with
 few amenities.                        
 Most residents are thus involved in   
 farming, or else retired, or commuters
 to nearby towns. There is a large     
 builders supplier near Sawdon. The    
 area probably attracts some visitors  
 but as more spectacular scenery       </content>
