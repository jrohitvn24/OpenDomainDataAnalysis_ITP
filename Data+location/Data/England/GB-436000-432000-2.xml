		<content> In the SW corner is the small village 
 of{Colton,}which borders onto         
{Templenewsam Park.}There are two farms
 in the village and a small school. In 
 the last year Colton has more than    
 doubled in size with the building of  
 the new{Colton Village Estate.        
                                       
 Before the Industrial Revolution,     
{Whitkirk,}an old village on top of a  
 hill clustered round the medieval     
 church of Saint Mary's, was the centre
 of the area, but the coming of the    
 railway led to{Crossgates}becoming the
 focal point. It is now the main       
 shopping centre of the area.          
                                       
 A number of old buildings survive in  
 Whitkirk. As well as the church there 
 is the old manor house and a number of
 other smaller houses.
