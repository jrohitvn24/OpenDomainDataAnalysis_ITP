		<content> HOME LIFE IN A VILLAGE OR RURAL       
 COMMUNITY FREQUENTLY REVOLVES AROUND  
 THE FAMILY KITCHEN WHERE MOTHER MAY BE
 PREPARING A MEAL OF FRESHLY GATHERED  
 PRODUCE WHICH FATHER HAS GROWN IN HIS 
 GARDEN OR ON AN ALLOTMENT (FOR WHICH  
 HE PAYS A NOMINAL RENT TO THE PARISH  
 COUNCIL OR THE EARL SPENCER IN THE    
 CASE OF CHAPEL BRAMPTON).             
 THERE IS ONLY MODERATE USE OF WHAT IS 
 COMMONLY CALLED CONVENIENCE FOOD      
 BECAUSE OF ITS LIMITED AVAILABILITY IN
 THE AREA.  FAST FOOD OUTLETS ARE      
 TOTALLY ABSENT FROM THESE COMMUNITIES.
 THE MAIN MEAL OF THE DAY IS OFTEN THE 
 EVENING ONE AS THE OLDER CHILDREN AND 
 FATHER MAY BE ASENT AT LUNCH-TIME.  A 
 TYPICAL DINNER (MAIN MEAL) MAY CONSIST
 OF THREE COURSES - A MAIN COURSE OF   
 MEAT OR FISH, POTATOES AND VEGETABLES;
 A SWEET COURSE OF PUDDING, FRUIT OR   
 CAKE; AND COFFEE, WITH EXTRA ON SUNDAY</content>
