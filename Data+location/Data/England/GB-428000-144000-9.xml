		<title>09THE A303 AT WEYHILL.</title>
		<content>   The A303, the main road to the West,
 passes through Weyhill and has been a 
 source of trouble for many years.     
 Numerous accidents have occurred and  
 there has been congestion causing     
 delays for traffic especially at      
 weekends in the Summer. Great numbers 
 of lorries and other heavy traffic    
 also use the road. To alleviate this a
 new stretch of dual-carriageway is    
 under construction between Hundred    
 Acre Corner roundabout, just outside  
 Andover, and Thruxton Down. This road 
 will eventually bypass Weyhill,       
 allowing it to return to the quiet    
 village it used to be. New bridges    
 have been built to take existing roads
 and the railway and the bridge at     
 Mullen's Pond is being extended to    
 accommodate the second carriageway. It
 is hoped to complete this work and    
 open the new road by early 1986.      </content>
