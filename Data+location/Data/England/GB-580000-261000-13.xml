		<content>Bread, coal and the mail were delivered
by horse drawn vehicles. Milk was not  
delivered in bottles. A horse drawn    
cart came round with a milk churn on it
and you filled a jug from the churn.   
The cattle market was on Wednesdays.   
Sheep, cows and pigs were herded along 
the streets from the railway station   
to the cattle pens. The car park behind
Woolworth's was the cattle market. The 
farm workers had to  shout a lot and   
wave sticks to keep the animals        
together thruogh the town. Boys liked  
to help as well. Sometimes an animal   
broke away and had to be chased        
through the town.                      
The stalls on the Cornhill and the     
Buttermarket on Wednesdays and         
Saturdays stayed open untill 9.00 pm.  
Mr. B. made sugar rock on his stall.   
The smell was lovely.
