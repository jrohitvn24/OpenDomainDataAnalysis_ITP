		<title>18THE WATER TOWER.</title>
		<content> The tower at Berry Hill was           
 constructed in 1926 to meet the demand
 of the area.It held 60,000 gallons of 
 water.A diesel driven pump pumped     
 water from the adjoining reservoir    
 into the water tower.                 
 In 1953 electrically driven pumps     
 replaced the old ones.A larger        
 electrically driven pump was installed
 in 1959,making it possible to fill the
 tower at night using cheaper          
 electricity.The smaller '1953' pump   
 was used in the daytime.              
 In 1970 the water tower was taken out 
 of use.Finally,in 1985 ,it was taken  
 down because it was in a dangerous    
 state.It took twelve weeks to         
 demolish.The main section was         
 dismantled on the 18th of April 1985.
