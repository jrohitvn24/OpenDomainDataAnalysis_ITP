		<title>16Shops in North Leigh</title>
		<content>In North Leigh there are only four     
shops because North Leigh is a small   
place. The Windmill Stores is as small 
supermarket. Its trade is selling all  
kinds of foods. There is a Post Office 
in Common Road which sells sweets and  
tinned food and different sorts of     
things. The butchers, which is in Park 
Road, sells meat. There is also a      
Newspaper shop  but it only sells      
newspapers. Most people in North Leigh 
would go to Witney to buy their food   
because there are plenty of shops in   
Witney and not enough in North Leigh.  
Most people would probably travel into 
Oxford to buy their clothes.
