		<title>18SHREWTON PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content> St. Mary's is now the main village    
 Parish Church of Shrewton. The Norman 
 building was rebuilt in 1855 using    
 Chilmark stone and flint.             
 The square clock tower contains six   
 bells which are rung regularly on     
 Sundays and on special occasions.     
 The stained glass windows are small   
 and arched. The roof is supported by a
 series of tall pillared archways which
 are decorated with carved stone       
 figures. The alter table stands on a  
 mosaic tiled floor with a brass cross 
 in the centre and two brass candle    
 sticks on either side.                
 A new Childrens' corner has just been 
 created to occupy young children      
 during church services.               
 A thriving choir has 15 members who   
 practice weekly, and lead the singing 
 each Sunday and at special ceremonies 
 such as weddings.                     </content>
