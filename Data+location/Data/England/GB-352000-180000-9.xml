		<content> As late as the nineteenth century this
 was very much a no-mans-land liable to
 be covered with sea water. Since,     
 however, the land has been opened up  
 and drained by means of rhines        
 (pronounced REENS - local word for    
 drainage ditches) farmers carry on    
 mixed farming.                        
 There are approx.10 working farms, the
 majority of the land is owned by the  
 Chemical works so most of the farmers 
 are employed. South of the railway    
 line farming is restricted to sheep,  
 beef and arable, whilst on the north  
 of the railway line there are some    
 dairy herds and cereal crops.         
 Farms consist of small fields bounded 
 by hedgerows and rhines.              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
