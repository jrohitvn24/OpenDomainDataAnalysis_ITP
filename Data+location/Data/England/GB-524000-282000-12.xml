		<content> This is a 17th. Century inn at Upwood.
 The landlord, Mr. McQueen, has worked 
 there for about 26 years. Part of it  
 used to be a butcher's shop. The      
 oldest part of the building is a long,
 black beam attached to the ceiling.   
 There is a hook on the ceiling to hang
 up a lantern during a blackout. On one
 of the fire-places there is a special 
 brick to commemorate Lady Diana's     
 wedding day in 1981. The bar is the   
 newest part of the inn. The inn was   
 built about 300 years ago. The        
 landlord thinks that when Upwood      
 Church was being built they also made 
 a wooden building for the workmen to  
 live in. That building, although it   
 has undergone several changes, is now 
 the inn that we have today.
