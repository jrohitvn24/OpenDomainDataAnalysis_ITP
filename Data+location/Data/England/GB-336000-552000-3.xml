 in that it is situated in a small     
 village outside of Carlisle next to   
 the river Caldew.The firm has been    
 producing high quality printed fabrics
 there for over 150 years.The firm was 
 bought by the John Lewis partnership  
 in 1966 but Stead Mcalpine is actually
 a co-operative with all of the        
 employees owning shares in the        
 company. Today the company prints over
 seven million metres of cloth a year  
 and has a catalouge of over two       
 thousand designs.Ofthis huge quantity 
 of quality material which sells  at   
 the top end of the price market,one   
 third goes directly to the U.S.A. one 
 third goes to United Kingdom customers
 who then export it as finished goods  
 and the final third stays in the      
 country.All this material is screen   
 printed                               </content>
