		<title>19PUBS AND INNS.</title>
		<content>  We have three pubs in our area and   
 they are all free-houses which means  
 they can sell what beer they want to. 
 The{Strode Arms}is in{Cranmore}and is 
 called that because the{Strodes}were  
 an important family in{Cranmore}a long
 time ago. The{Abbey Barn}in{Doulting  
 is probably called that because the   
 monks from{Glastonbury Abbey}used to  
 own a lot of land and buildings in    
{Doulting}including the{Tithe Barn     
 near this pub. The{Poachers Pocket}is 
 in{Chelynch}and a poacher is someone  
 who used to hunt fish and animals     
 illegally to eat or sell. All these   
 pubs sell food as well as drinks and  
 they have games inside such as a      
 pool-table in Cranmore and fruit      
 machines and Space Invaders. The{Abbey
{Barn}has a{skittle alley,}while the   
 other two have beer gardens and a car 
 park.                                 </content>
