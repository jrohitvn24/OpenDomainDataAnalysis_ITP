		<title>01A GENERAL REVIEW OF HARBURY</title>
		<content> Harbury is near the centre of England,
 on a hill in fairly rolling           
 countryside.  It has a population of  
 about 2500.  It is about 7 miles from 
 Leamington, 4 from Southam, l5 from   
 Coventry.  It is a commuter village;  
 most men work in Leamington.  The     
 majority of mothers work too.  There  
 are 8 shops, 6 pubs, and a bank.      
 There is a bus service, though nearly 
 all journeys out of the village are   
 made by car.  Only accommodation is   
 the Caravan Club Site at Cottage      
 Close.  The village is surrounded by  
 agricultural land.  Places of interest
 locally include Warwick and the       
 Castle, Kenilworth Castle, Leamington,
 Stratford and more locally, Chesterton
 Windmill.
