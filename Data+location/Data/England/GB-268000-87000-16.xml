		<title>16POPULATION OF CHAGFORD</title>
		<content> The latest figures available for the  
 above are those of the{1981 Census,   
 carried out by the{Parish Council.}It 
 showed that the figure was{1304,}com_ 
 pared to{1250}in{1971. }An interesting
 fact shown up was the balance of ages,
 as the{% of people over 60 was above  
{both the county and national averages.
 Of the total residents in the area    
 served by the Chagford Health Centre, 
{nearly 100 were over the age of 80.   
 At the other end of the spectrum the  
 number of school_age children has de_ 
 clined steadily.  At the same time,   
 there has been a greater increase in  
 the number of dwellings, resulting in 
 fewer people per household as living  
 standards have risen. The majority    
 view seems to be that the present pop_
 ulation should remain constant, with  
 any increase carried out 'slowly' and 
 under proper control.                 </content>
