		<content> There are 107 properties in the       
 village, displaying a wide range of   
 building materials, from a traditional
 thatched cottage, examples of local   
 flint construction and clay lump to   
 the modern brick.  Styles are equally 
 varied:  modernised old properties,   
 purpose built bungalows for the       
 retired, a converted school, etc.     
 Houses lie along the road (C148),     
 known as The Street, with two small   
 enclaves branching on either side of  
 the High Bridgham road.               
                                       
 Ownership patterns, as showed by our  
 survey returns, are:
