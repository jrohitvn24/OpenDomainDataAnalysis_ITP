		<title>12LOWDHAM BY-PASS.</title>
		<content>   Lowdham is a village that has been  
 divided into two parts by it's        
 by-pass.                              
   The by-pass was first built during  
 the 1930's and later extended.It now  
 diverts the main A6097,which links    
 Doncaster and Leicester,away from the 
 main part of the village.             
   However the by-pass does not pass   
 around the village but cuts it        
 pratically in half.                   
   Most of the children who were asked 
 whether they preferred to have a      
 by-pass did so,but they wished it had 
 gone around the outside of the village
 as it is now a very dangerous road to 
 cross.It is especially difficult for  
 those people who live across the      
 by-pass from the shops.               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
