		<title>10Cadbury Chocolate, Keynsham.</title>
		<content>   Cadbury's factory in Keynsham was   
 opened in 1936. The factory is called 
 Somerdale. Before it became Cadbury's 
 the company was called Fry's. (It is  
 now called Cadbury-Schweppes.) They   
 make chocolate bars and some sweets.  
 In one year they make about 50,000    
 tonnes of confectionary. Somerdale is 
 in between the River Avon and the main
 railway line from Bristol to London.  
 The site covers 228 acres. You enter  
 the factory along a long peaceful     
 drive shaded by trees. In front of the
 factory is a large sports field and   
 social club for the 1729 employees.   
 Also by the entrance are the remains  
 of a Roman Villa. Keynsham Carnival   
 procession ends at Cadbury's Ground   
 and there is a fair. A large Cad-     
 bury's sign is lit up every evening.  
 It is a famous local landmark. How-   
 ever local people still call it Fry's.</content>
