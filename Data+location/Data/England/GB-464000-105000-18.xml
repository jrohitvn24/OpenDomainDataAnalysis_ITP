		<title>18Widley Walk</title>
		<content>  In 1944 tanks were hidden under trees
 in many places to protect them from   
 bombing while they waited for the     
 Normandy Invasion. In Widley Walk you 
 can still see the barred iron grids   
 which stopped the heavy tanks from    
 sinking into the earth. The night     
 before the embarkation allied officers
 held a Knights' Vigil in Christ Church
 on top of the hill. People who lived  
 nearby remember coming out in the     
 morning to wish the tank crews 'God   
 Speed' as they rumbled down into      
 Portsmouth.                           
  1984 saw many commemorative          
 celebrations including a memorial     
 service in Christ Church, a bonfire   
 and barbecue at Fort Widley and       
 several street parties.
