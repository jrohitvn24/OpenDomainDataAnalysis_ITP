was erected in 1846 at a cost of 142   
pounds and the last enlargement took   
place in 1911.The church had control   
until 1931 when Surrey C.C. leased the 
school.The old log books record a      
smallpox epidemic,lack of fresh water, 
fuel  and space. Children were kept    
away to help with the harvest,picking  
hops and lifting potatoes, Singing,    
needlework and drawing predominated as 
curriculum subjects. Grants were       
awarded on inspection results and      
children had to pay a small amount
