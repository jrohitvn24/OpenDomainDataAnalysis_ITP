		<content> On this{sandy acid soil}the native    
 trees (silver birch, oak and Scot's   
 pine) are now confined to small areas 
 of woodland and gardens.{Hedgerows}are
 common despite the recent ravages of  
 Dutch Elm disease. Housing and        
 agricultural needs have meant some    
{loss of woodland}and, therefore, of   
 violets, heather and also the         
 wood-ant. Peacock and Small           
 Tortoiseshell{butterflies}are common  
 but High Brown and Pearl-bordered     
 Fritillary butterflies have           
 disappeared. Many{birds,}such as      
 magpies and jays, are adapting to     
 gardens. Man-made pools have          
 encouraged an increase in{frogs and   
{toads. Grey squirrels}are common;{deer
 and{foxes}are occasionally seen. Since
 the 1960s many oaks are attacked      
 annually by the Knopper gall. Public  
 footpaths are well-marked.            </content>
