		<content>This area is quite isolated so people  
have to travel to the town if they want
organised entertainment.At home they   
can watch television or listen to the  
radio.                                 
As many families live on farms the     
children get used to helping with the  
farmwork which means that they donÂ£t   
get too bored.However,the children have
to entertain themselves in their spare 
time and as many families have large   
gardens they can play tennis and other 
sports.                                
In the 1980Â£s horse riding has become  
very popular again.There is at least   
one house with new stables in G.R.0743,
so this sport is available to the      
families in this area.                 
A car is a necessity in this rural area
and in a small survey it was discovered
that very few people used the train    
even when going on longer journeys.    </content>
