 people thought of the shopping        
 precinct itself.

 The peoples' favourite shop was       
 Morrisons Supermarket. This was       
 favoured by 58%.                      
                                       
 We then asked about peoples' dislikes:
 In fact, 54% thought that the precinct
 was alright as it was. The complaints 
 we did find were about litter (the    
 main dislike), children riding bikes, 
 the lack of toilets and the pigeons.  </content>
