		<title>20CONSERVATION IN BEDFORDSHIRE</title>
		<content> One of the most active organisations  
 working to conserve the countryside in
 south west Cambridgeshire and         
 Bedfordshire is the{Bedfordshire and  
{Huntingdonshire Naturalist Trust.}They
 are responsible for the cutting of a  
 new nature trail in the southern area 
 of the{Wyboston Lakes Leisure Park.}It
 is hoped that the trail will be       
 completed by September 1985. This     
 small natural area is bounded by the  
 River Great Ouse to the east and      
 farmland close to the village of      
 Wyboston to the west. Existing tracks 
 are being supplemented by new pathways
 which wind through tall reeds and     
 wooded glades. There is a wide variety
 of birds and insects to be seen as    
 well as small fish in the streams and 
 river. Grass Snakes and Adders have   
 also been observed.
