		<content>by A.Buckle,S.Leigh,N.Wreford,E.Lewis. 
                                       
We interviewed two teenagers,Tracy     
Moody(13) and Amanda Sillence(19).     
Tracy attends La Sagesse Convent School
while Amanda is unemployed.They both   
like Wellow because it is quiet.       
Amanda feels there are not enough jobs.
She has no qualifications.Tracy has    
lived in Wellow all her life,Amanda    
has not been there long but intends to 
stay.                                  
Amanda says there is no social life for
her in Wellow as she is older, but Trac
has plenty of clubs for her age group  
like discos,youth clubs,Brownies and   
Guides. Amanda thinks there is a lot of
support from villagers for unemployed  
people.This shows us that Wellow offers
more facilities for younger teenagers.
