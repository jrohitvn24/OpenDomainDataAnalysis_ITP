		<content>{Holy Trinity Church}is at the very    
 centre of the village and parts of it 
 date back to the 14th century. The    
 oldest building in{Barrow}is over 650 
 years old. It is called the Bishop    
 Beveridge House after the most famous 
 Barrovian who was born there. It used 
 to be the vicarage and is thought to  
 have a passage leading to the church  
 but no one has found it. The house is 
 made of local materials such as       
 Mountsorrel granite, Swithland slates,
 red clay brick, oak timbers, pebbles, 
 reeds and Barrow limestone. A few red 
 brick knitters' cottages are on the   
 same street which used to be called   
 Industry Street. At the top of this   
 street is a round house built in 1827 
 as the{village lock up.}Next to this  
 is the{forge.}The tools are left just 
 as the blacksmith left them many years
 ago.{C.SPEIGHT R.HARDY F.KING K.BOND }</content>
