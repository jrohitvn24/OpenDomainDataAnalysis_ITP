 4.30a.m he wakes up and at 5.30 he    
 starts to milk the cows.After he has  
 done the milking he feeds the heifers 
 with hay and staw and cake.Then he    
 goes to see the dry cows to see if    
 any of then have calf.Then  he comes  
 home for breakfast .Then when he      
 has had breakfast he goes back to     
 another farm and does some tractor    
 work at 1o'clock he comes home for    
 dinner.After dinner he goes on and    
 looks at some more cattle then he goes
 and milk the cows again then he       
 returns  home for his tea at          
 7o'clock.And after tea Daddy falls to 
 sleep and Mummy starts moaning.
