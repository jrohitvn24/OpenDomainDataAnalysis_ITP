		<title>09COMBE HOUSE HOTEL C McCANN</title>
		<content> Since Saxon times a house has stood at
 the head of the valley. The present   
 Combe house (the third) is now a      
 highly successful hotel run by John   
 and Therese Boswell with about 25     
 staff, accommodating 24 guests, with  
 diners from the locality frequenting  
 the restaurant.                       
 Most of the features of the 14th      
 century house have been retained      
 despite the conversion into a hotel.  
 Many original pieces of furniture and 
 a plethora of old family portraits are
 in evidence, and all the original     
 carved plasterwork ceilings are still 
 intact. The recent muralling has been 
 done by Therese.                      
 In the 8 acres are 3 cottages, some   
 rare and ancient trees and shrubs from
 all corners of the globe and a walled 
 kitchen garden producing much of the  
 produce for the restaurant            </content>
