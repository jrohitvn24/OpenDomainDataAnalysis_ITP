		<title>07The Rectory Litlington</title>
		<content> The rectory at Litlington is an early 
 flint house with stone facings,       
 modernised inside but retaining some  
 interesting features such as the      
 stone arched doorway and a mullioned  
 window in the north wall. There is    
 also unusual ballustrading to the     
 staircase called Chinese Chippendale  
 similar to Wilmington Priory and      
 Sackville College at East Grinstead.  
 The house has fine cellars and an     
 indication of an underground passage. 
 Like many small villages, Litlington  
 has to share a vicar with another     
 parish,and the Old Rectory is now the 
 home of the Bishop of Lewes together  
 with a number of young men who are    
 giving "a year to Christ" -working    
 with the bishop in various ways in the
 local communities before following    
 their chosen careers.
