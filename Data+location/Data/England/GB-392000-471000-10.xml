		<title>10TOURISM IN ARNCLIFFE</title>
		<content>   Most tourists come in the summer    
 time.  The majority are day trippers, 
 who park their cars round the village 
 green and the church, because there is
 no official carpark in Arncliffe, nor 
 are there any public toilets.         
   There are three establishments where
 visitors can stay; the Falcon Inn,    
 Amerdale House Hotel, and Raikes      
 Cottage.   These places also provide  
 refreshments for day visitors, and    
 there is one other house where light  
 refreshments can be obtained.         
  Apart from coming to enjoy the       
 unspoilt beautiful countryside,       
 tourists can find pleasure in the     
 fishing, walking, picnicing,          
 bird-watching and painting            
 opportunities available in the Dale.  
   Tourism is probably the second most 
 important source of employment in the 
 Dale, being surpassed only by farming.</content>
