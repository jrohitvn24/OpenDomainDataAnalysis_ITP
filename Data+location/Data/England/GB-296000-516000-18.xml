 and Mrs Gate.The Gates bought the     
 farm in 1964 then they started to     
 breed pigs,sheep and cattle.All the   
 crops which they grow are for animal  
 fodder e.g. hay &amp; barley.They have a  
 lot of fields around the farm and     
 twenty fields down at Mirehouse that  
 they rent from another farmer.        
    Their stock mainly consists of     
 cattle.The cattle that they own are   
 twenty-five beef cattle,one Hereford  
 Bull,twelve dry cows,thirty-five      
 stirks and nine Friesian calfs.The    
 milk that comes off the cows is cooled
 and sent to Distington Creamery ,where
 it is bottled and sold.The pigs that  
 the Gates have are mainly fat pigs    
 which are bought &amp; sold at Cockermouth
 &amp; Carlisle Auctions.A licence is      
 needed to transport pigs.
