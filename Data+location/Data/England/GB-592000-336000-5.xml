		<content> The{Holy House,}centre of the         
 pilgrimage, was restored in{1931}by{  
{Father Alfred Hope Patten,}Vicar of   
 Walsingham. This reminds pilgrims of  
 the home in Nazareth of Jesus Christ, 
 and of Mary his mother and St. Joseph,
 and is a holy place of prayer. The{   
{statue of Our Lady of Walsingham,}    
 (Mary with the Christ Child) is a     
 focal point in the Holy House which   
 itself stands within a larger church. 
 Each pilgrimage includes Mass,        
 processions in the grounds, and       
 prayers for healing and strength from 
 God during{Sprinkling at the Well,}   
 dating from 1061. Many of the 500,000 
 visitors each year visit the Shrine.  
 Over 7,000 stay in the{Hospice}or in  
 the village and over 7,500 make day   
 pilgrimages from Britain and overseas.
