		<title>14FAMILY LIFE ON A FARM</title>
		<content> When I get home from school I unpack  
 my bag, then go upstairs to change out
 of my school clothes. I help my mum to
 make the tea. If she doesn't need my  
 help I go outside and help my Dad.    
 Sometimes I help feed the animals. We 
 have 22 chickens, 6 calves, 2 sheep   
 and 2 lambs.                          
 When my sister comes home from Queen  
 Elizabeth Secondary School, Crediton, 
 we have tea. After tea we all have to 
 help with the washing up.             
 When we have finished our jobs we     
 either watch television or go         
 outside.                              
 At 7.30 pm I have to get ready for    
 bed. On school days I go to bed at 8  
 o'clock. At the weekend I am allowed  
 to stay until 8.30. At the weekend we 
 sometimes go into Exeter, or travel to
 a place like Torquay for the day.
