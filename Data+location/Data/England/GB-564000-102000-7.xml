		<content> Over half the residents of Pevensey   
 village are {pensioners}.It is a      
 quaint English village with many      
 interesting old buildings ,and some   
 houses of up to 500 years old.The     
 elderly residents form a closely knit 
 community and rely heavily on local   
 shops.They enjoy walking and gardening
{ Pevensey Town Trust}is made up of    
 local volunteers who are responsible  
 for the upkeep of the{Court House}and 
 the{Old Cattle Market,}now used as a  
 car park.East Sussex Council is       
 responsible for many local services.  
 Local people are hopeful that they    
 will provide a by-pass to take{heavy  
{traffic}away from Pevensey High Street
 Southdown buses also serve this       
 community.The small fire station has  
 one appliance and is run by a team of 
 part_time firemen.One fireman is also 
 the postman for Pevensey village.     </content>
