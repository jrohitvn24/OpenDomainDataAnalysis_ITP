When children leave school at 16,no    
matter what qualifications,they find   
it difficult to get a job.Computers    
take over lots of jobs that people     
used to do.There are a lot of young    
people with nothing to do.Some get on  
training schemes or go to the college, 
but some cause trouble like vandalism. 
                                       
POLLUTION                              
This is a problem near the motorway.   
Noise is very bad and they have put up 
high wooden fences to try and stop it. 
There are a lot of fumes from the cars 
and lorries as well.
