		<content>                                       
 Sibthorpe is a small hamlet outside of
 Elston and the A46.The main attraction
 is the dovecote.It was built in       
 1370,after the Norman conquest and    
 used by the monks in the nearby       
 monastry for pigeon storage.In the    
 dovecote are 1334 holes that the      
 pigeons laid eggs in.The monks then   
 came and collected and ate the        
 eggs.The dovecote entrance is a small 
 wooden door 11 cm thick.It was small  
 so that no birds could escape while a 
 monk was entering.The dovecote is 9.14
 metres tall,it has 90 cm thick walls  
 and its internal diameter is 7.80288  
 metres.  It is made of Sleaford stone 
 and held together by limestone        
 mortar.The famine of 1360 encouraged  
 the monks to build it.The original    
 owner was William de Sibthorpe,now it 
 is Michael Burton,a local farmer.     </content>
