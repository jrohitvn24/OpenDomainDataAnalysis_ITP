		<title>12 Fruit Farming (4)</title>
		<content>The farm has its own generators to run 
the cold stores in case of power       
cuts.2000 pounds a month is spent on   
electricity.Recent changes include     
selling of considerable amounts of     
first class fruit (Cox, Crispin and    
Spartan) for making fruit juice.They   
are always looking to carry out work   
more cheaply and to improve the yield  
per acre.Times are competitive and     
presentation and quality needs to be   
higher.There is much competion from    
other countries.A recent development   
has been the cold chain.The fruit is   
taken from cold store into cold store  
lorries and out into cold store again. 
Another less recent trend has been the 
amalgamation of smaller farms,so that  
now ownership is concentrated in the   
hands of the fortunate few.Not so many 
labourers are needed with modern       
methods and technology.                </content>
