		<title>06CROSTON CLOSE FARM (1)</title>
		<content>   All the fields are enclosed by dry  
 stone walls or barbed wire fences.It  
 occupies 78 acres of which only 31 are
 machineable (the rest is too steep).  
 48 acres are rough pasture.           
   The farm is worked by only one man. 
 The topsoil has been removed from the 
 best fields leaving only clay. The    
 farmer starts his day at 7 o'clock and
 works until about 9 at night. His only
 break is Christmas day.               
   The farmer uses a muck-spreader     
 plough and tractor. The water supply  
 comes from the mains and it takes a   
 full day to fill his storage tanks.
