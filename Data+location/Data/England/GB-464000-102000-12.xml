 nt site in Gladys Avenue in 1963 and  
 received a major extension ten years  
 later.It stocks books for all ages and
 provides local information.           
   Membership is open to all but most  
 library members live locally.It is the
 second biggest library in Portsmouth, 
 issuing over 301,000 books on its     
 computerized system - a rate of over  
 150 books an hour!                    
    In addition to their services to   
 individual members the library        
 supplies Old Peoples Homes,Community  
 Centres and Nurseries.It also runs a  
 regular story time and craft session  
 for the young and provides special    
 tapes of books for the blind.
