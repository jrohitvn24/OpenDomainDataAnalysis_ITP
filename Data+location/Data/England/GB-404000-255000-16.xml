		<content> Water voles are the largest voles to  
be found in this country.Often         
mistakenly called water rats,they are  
harmless and feed on willow and grass  
along the sides of slow running rivers.
 The grey squirrel is an unpopular     
animal with foresters.Introduced from  
America it soon spread throughout the  
country and is a great pest eating the 
bark and shoots off saplings.Rabbits   
are also widespread pests.This         
attractive animal lived in warrens     
until the outbreak of myxomatosis.Since
then they have lived mainly under      
bramble thickets.A relative of the     
rabbit is the brown hare.This is a     
solitary animal which is very          
attractive and has longer ears and     
legs than the rabbit.Two closely       
related killers are the stoat and the  
weasel which are also found in this    
area.                                  </content>
