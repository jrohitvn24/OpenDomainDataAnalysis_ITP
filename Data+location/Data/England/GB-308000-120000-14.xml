		<title>14VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content> In Langford Budville there has never  
 been a village hall. There was a      
 working mans club that had to close   
 down because there was not enough     
 money to keep it going. A new hall is 
 needed because of the lack of         
 facilities within the parish. It will 
 be built on a site at The Three Ashes.
 It will cost about Â£13,500 and Â£6,500 
 still has to be raised. There is a    
 fund raising committee of twenty      
 people and the children have helped to
 raise a lot of money as well. The     
 events which are organized to raise   
 money are Bingo evenings, Fetes,      
 sponsored skittles, walks and Charity 
 Queen contest. The new village hall   
 will be used for different clubs for  
 adults and children, parish meetings, 
 dances, discos and many other events.
