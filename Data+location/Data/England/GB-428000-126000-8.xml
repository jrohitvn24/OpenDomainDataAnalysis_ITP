		<content> The abbatoir is at Fontley, near      
 Portsmouth. The calves come from      
 S.Wales. The farmer likes to grow his 
 own barley and hay for his animals. He
 has his own ploughs, drills, sprayer, 
 combine harvester, grain drier and    
 roll bailer.                          
                                       
 On Thursday 27th June we went to visit
 School Farm grid ref.305361. We were  
 met by the manager of the farm. He    
 showed us a map of the farm and we    
 thought the names of the fields were  
 very interesting as they told us where
 to find them. One field down by the   
 water meadows, grid ref. 307261, is   
 called the Sling. The other names are 
 Pub Paddock, Street Farm Paddock,     
 Butts Green Paddock, Stable Paddock;  
 these fields are used to graze horses 
 or for hay. The stables are with the  
 farm buidings, just S of the area.    </content>
