		<title>03    Farming around Barham</title>
		<content> The{soil}is mainly chalky,solid chalk 
underneath with patches of good soil   
varying from 4 inches to 4 feet;some   
clay on hills surrounding the valley.  
 Farms in the area range from 53  to   
500 acres.Most fields are between      
10 and 20 acres,though one farmer had  
a field of 70 acres,bigger than the    
 smallest farm!{Woodland}in the area is
either coppice (used for fencing) or   
{parkland.}The majority of farms are   
owned.Locally we have sheep,dairy      
herds (Fresian)a few chickens(not for  
their eggs)and crops ie.wheat          
(flour),barley(beer),oats,lupins and   
sunflowers(an experiment) and rape for 
oil,peas,grass(for seed) and beans for 
human consumption.Local farmers are    
protecting the area,by keeping trees   
and retaining small fields,protecting  
old buildings,even by creating a       
natural pond for wildlife.             </content>
