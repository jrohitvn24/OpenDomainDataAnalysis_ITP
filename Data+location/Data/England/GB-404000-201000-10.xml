		<content>  In{Ampney Crucis}village, there are  
 over 160 cars. 46 households have 2 or
 more cars. At least 17 households have
 no car. Out of 162 people questioned, 
 94 had never used the bus service, 40 
 seldom used it and 29 used it often. A
 service nine times a day from{Fairford
 to{Cirencester}along the A 417.       
 Marchant's village bus goes to{       
{Cirencester}on Tuesday, Friday and    
 Saturday. Before the re-opening of the
 Post Office inadequate transport made 
 it difficult for pensioners to find   
 enough time to collect their pensions 
 in {Cirencester},so some car owners   
 took them to{Poulton}Post Office.     
 Transport is provided to the          
 comprehensive schools but has to be   
 paid for by parents. Some pupils      
 cycle. Students find transport to {   
{Swindon}or{Gloucester}difficult to    
 obtain.                               </content>
