		<content>  Locks Heath Centre took about{nine   
{months}to build.It was built to help  
 shoppers in the area so that they     
 didn't have to go far away to do their
 shopping.As you enter there is a      
 garage and a car park.It has          
{twenty-six shops}and two{playgrounds  
 for older and younger children.It also
 has sports facilities,toilets,a clock 
 tower and a dentist.                  
  Lockswood was a good place for       
 children to play football,hide and    
 seek,go horseriding and play on their 
 bikes.There was a large field where   
 people had picnics and took their dogs
 for a walk.{Gypsies}used to go there  
 but they were removed by the Council  
 and were stopped by ditches around the
 side.People probably miss taking their
{dogs for a walk}and seeing all the    
 animals and flowers mainly bluebells, 
 buttercups and daisies.               </content>
