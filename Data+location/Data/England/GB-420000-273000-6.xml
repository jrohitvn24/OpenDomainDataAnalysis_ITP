		<title>06A COAL MINE NEAR BALSALL</title>
		<content> On the 6th of June 1985,the National  
 Coal Board published a proposal to    
 build a large Coalmine close to the   
 village of Balsall Common.It could be 
 one of the largest coalfields in the  
 country. Although it is not in our    
 block it still effects us.There have  
 been two public meetings to protest   
 about it. We went to the village and  
 asked people about it. Most people did
 not want the coalmine close to them.  
 Many were worried that the prices of  
 their houses would drop in value.     
 People were worried about the         
 increased number of lorries and cars  
 on the roads. We asked one old lady   
 would it spoil the village, and she   
 said that in her view "It was already 
 spoilt to the way she knew it."       
 by Rachel Dodd, Jonathan Moore and    
 Katie Powell.
