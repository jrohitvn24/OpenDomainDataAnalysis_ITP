		<title>11Feldom Army Range</title>
		<content>  Feldom range is an area of 6000      
 acres, sheep and cattle graze there.  
 Live ammunition is used and the farmer
 rounds up the sheep into safe         
 enclosures. Army units from all over  
 Britain shoot here for practice. Mr.  
 Jameson is the warden in charge of the
 area.                                 
     The army try and preserve birds   
 habitats and the wild flowers, they   
 have a team of people to help them who
 are geologists and archaeologists. A  
 Bronze age village has been found and 
 the site is not disturbed. There is a 
 barrow and some cup and ring stones   
 that no one in the world knows what   
 they mean. They are also building a   
 nesting box for a barn owl.           
     We were escorted by Major Wilson  
 and Colonel Le Mesurier.
