		<title>06FISHING INDUSTRY</title>
		<content> Although Coverack owes its development
 to{fishing}and the sea, fishing as an 
{industry}plays very little part in the
 life of the village today, and few of 
 the local people earn their living    
 from it.{Shell fish}are caught in pots
 which used to be made to a traditional
 design and of local grown withies.    
 Today there are several types of pots 
 made of many different materials,     
 though the trend seems to be back to  
 the original design in modern, more   
 durable materials.                    
 Coverack fishermen catch{mackerel}    
 using hooks which are decorated with  
 feathers to attract the fish, having  
 as many as 20 to 25 hooks on a line.  
{Demersal}fish are caught by nets or by
 longline. Longlines are lengths of    
 thin rope with a hook every 1.5       
 fathoms, and may have hundreds of     
 hooks along their lengths.            </content>
