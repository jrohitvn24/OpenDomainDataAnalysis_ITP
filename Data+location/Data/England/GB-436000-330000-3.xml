		<title>03Environmental impact, Derby</title>
		<content> The Rolls Royce complex at Sinfin has 
 had a profound effect on the          
 environment. Vast areas of farmland   
 have been lost to works, yards and    
 huge car parks. New roads have been   
 constructed which have and will       
 swallow up land, especially when the  
 spur from the Derby-Stoke link road is
 built into Allenton, to serve the     
 industries. Local people now complain 
 about the almost continuous noise from
 the aero-engine test beds, whilst the 
 odour of fuel fumes can be detected   
 over one kilometre downwind of the    
 works. An additional effect of the    
 works can be experienced at 08.30 and 
 16.00, when the car parks empty and   
 the roads become totally congested.
