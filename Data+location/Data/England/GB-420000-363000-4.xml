		<title>04WELL DRESSINGS (1)</title>
		<content> In Youlgrave every year we have well  
 dressings. We have had well dressings 
 for over 150 years. We dress the wells
 to say thank you for our lovely spring
 water. There are five well dressings. 
{The Reading Room}well usually has     
 children in its picture. The next is  
 at the{Fountain,}built in 1829. It    
 is called the Fountain because        
 originally it was meant to have a     
 spray of water but it didn't work out.
 The third well is at{Holywell Lane.   
 The fourth well is{Banktop}well and   
 the last well is at{Coldwell End.}Each
 well has a wooden box with a slot in  
 so they can collect money towards the 
 chosen charities. I helped to do some 
 of the children's well dressing that  
 stands at the church. We make the     
 wells with all different kinds of     
 flower petals, moss and clay.
