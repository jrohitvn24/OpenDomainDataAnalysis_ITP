		<content>     The{British Chrome and Chemical   
 works was founded on the Urlay Nook   
 site 150 years ago originally to make 
 artificial fertilizers, using         
 sulphuric acid. The nearby railway    
 line which opened in 1825 was used to 
 transport the products to the local   
 port of Yarm.                         
                                       
     It is a large collection of grey  
 buildings which look very out of place
 in such a rural area. Steam appears to
 be one by-product of the manufacture  
 of Chrome, although the plant also has
 its own{pollution monitors}to check   
 for other gases which may be brought  
 down dissolved in the rain.           
     The buildings and the steam are   
 very{colourful}and impressive at night
 when they are lit up by many small red
 and yellow lights.
