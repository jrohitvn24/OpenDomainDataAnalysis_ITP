		<title>13Ghost stories</title>
		<content> None can see the ghostly coach of the 
 Turbervilles but those who have       
 Turberville blood in their veins. From
 Gallows Hill to Bere Regis, on the eve
 of Old Lady Day, the sound of a coach 
 is heard and is of ill-omen to the    
 Turberville who hears it. A murder was
 committed centuries ago by one of the 
 family who is said to have abducted a 
 beautiful woman. She tried to escape  
 from the coach and in the struggle he 
 killed her. Girls living at Philliols 
 Farm often heard footsteps at night   
 like someone walking in wellington    
 boots steadily round the house. The   
 deaf old collie once leapt up barking 
 and growling as the steps went past.  
 Recently the steps have been heard in 
 upstairs rooms. In a cottage at       
 Chamberlaynes sleepers had to change  
 rooms after regular nightmares. A     
 murder had been committed there.      </content>
