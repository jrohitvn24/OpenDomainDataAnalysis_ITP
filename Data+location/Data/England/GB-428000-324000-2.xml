 Maths, English, French and P.E.       
 On Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays we  
 have{ASSEMBLIES}. This is an activity 
 which involves us in singing and our  
 Headmaster tells us stories. Then the 
 points for each team are announced and
 the winning{HOUSE CAPTAINS}hold up the
 points cup with a coloured ribbon on  
 it. The Houses are{HADDON}- yellow;  {
{HARDWICK}- blue;{PEVERIL}- green and  
{CHATSWORTH}- red.                     
 After school there are many{clubs}    
 which we can join. For example MONDAY 
 is Craft Club, WEDNESDAY is Netball,  
 Football, THURSDAY is table tennis.   
  On top of these we have netball and  
 football matches during the season.   
  A busy time can be had by everyone.
