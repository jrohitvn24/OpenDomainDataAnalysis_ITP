		<title>14Police in Wolsingham</title>
		<content>   The{police station}is only a house  
 in a small housing estate and is open 
 between 9am and 5pm.The main station  
 is in Crook,6 miles east with a       
 substation at Stanhope 6 miles        
 westwards.The original police station 
 and house has been converted into two 
 private houses.                       
   The{local policeman}is Mr Halliday. 
 He has been in Wolsingham for two     
 years living in a house next door to  
 his station.He loves walking and      
 talking to the public, but enjoys     
 court appearances rather less.        
  His work includes desk               
 duty,foot and mobile patrols,traffic  
 control and collecting stray dogs.    
 There is{not much crime}in the town   
 but he has been beaten up twice.Being 
 a policeman means that he does not    
 have many friends outside the Force.
