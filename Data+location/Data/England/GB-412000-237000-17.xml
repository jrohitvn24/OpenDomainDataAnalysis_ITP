		<content>  Chipping Campden has a unique Morris 
 Dancing team composed of six dancers, 
 a fool, a hobby horse with the music  
 played by a fiddler. They dance at    
 important occasions like Scuttlebrook 
 Wake and at fetes.                    
  The other great Campden tradition is 
 the Campden Mummers. They have a play 
 of great antiquity which tells the    
 tale of King George and the Turkish   
 Knight and how the former was slain   
 and brought back to life by Dr Haro   
 and his assistant Jack Vinney. The    
 Mummers tour the pubs and big houses  
 during the Christmas period and as the
 night goes on the play becomes less   
 coherent.                             
 There is one curious custom on St     
 Thomas's Day,December 21st of ringing 
 the church bells at 6 a.m. then bread 
 is distributed to the householders of 
 Leysbourne.This was a charity bequest.</content>
