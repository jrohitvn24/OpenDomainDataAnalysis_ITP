 The family living at Watts Barn are   
 very concerned with conservation and  
 are setting up a small local project. 
 Southfield Clump is a small wood      
 containing a wide variety of shrubs   
 and trees. Larger mature trees include
 mostly ash,a few beech, oak,lime and  
 Scots Pine. In some areas where large 
 elm have been extracted, many small   
 plants and shrubs have appeared.There 
 are many young beech trees growing    
 throughout most of the wood,also two  
 small areas of ash saplings.To the NW 
 is a section of young wild cherries.At
 the S.andW. edges are hedgerows of    
 hawthorn,elder.dog rose and wild      
 privet. In two glades within the wood,
 butterflies are very common.
