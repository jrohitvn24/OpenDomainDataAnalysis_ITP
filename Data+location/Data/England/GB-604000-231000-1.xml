 Dedham,in Essex,is a village of 1600  
 inhabitants.It is situated 8 miles    
 North East of Colchester and 10 miles 
 South West of Ipswich,near the A12    
 trunk road,close to the River Stour,  
 the boundary between Essex and        
 Suffolk. During the 15th and 16th     
 centuries the flourishing wool trade  
 in East Anglia made Dedham one of the 
 wealthiest villages in the area. There
 are still traces of the wool trade in 
 several local houses. Southfields is a
 unique example of a weavers house and 
 factory. The Church was built with    
 money from the wool trade. John       
 Constable made Dedham famous in his   
 paintings. The village's connection   
 with  painting continued into the     
 present century when Sir Alfred       
 Munnings lived in the village.        </content>
