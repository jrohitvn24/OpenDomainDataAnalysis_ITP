		<content> Easlier this year trouble broke out   
 between the village youths and youths 
 from Bradley.The Bradley youths came  
 into the village looking for trouble  
 and they fought the Laceby youths led 
 by Justin Quickfall,better known as   
 Juggers,with sticks.The police quickly
 came and sorted them out and Juggers  
 was arrested for obstructing the      
 pavement and spent the night in goal. 
 The following day it was rumoured that
 more trouble was coming and the police
 toured the village.They arranged a    
 game of rounders on the playing field 
 and there was no trouble.             
 There was even trouble between Laceby 
 youths following the end of this years
 Cup Final but again police quickly    
 sorted it out.                        
 Today Laceby is as quiet as it usually
 is.
