		<content> Pocket money is the amount of money   
 you receive each week from your       
 relations. We did a survey on the age 
 groups 4-5,7-8,and 10-11.             
 In the 4-5 age group the mean was 14p 
 and the median was 10p.               
 In the 7-8 age group the mean was 66p 
 and the median was 80p.               
 In the 10-11 age group the mean was   
 85p and the median was Â£1.50.         
    Most people either saved their     
 money or spent it on sweets.          
    In the younger age groups most     
 people saved their money and in the   
 older age group the people either     
 spent it on sweets or went swimming.
