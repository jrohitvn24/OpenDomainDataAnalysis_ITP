		<content> A Congregational Church and a         
 Methodist Chapel still thrive.        
   Villagers of various denominations  
 organise a joint Christian Aid Week in
 June of each year when many           
 fund-raising events are arranged. Most
 people in Chinnor, including school   
 children, take part and it is always  
 most successful with its Concert,     
 Hunger Lunch, Fete, and Christian Aid 
 Walk etc.                             
   Church services at Christmas and    
 Easter are well attended. In fact,    
 churches in Chinnor add much to the   
 community life of the village.
