		<title>13S.NORMANTON CHILDREN'S GAMES</title>
		<content> We asked our parents which playground 
 games were most popular in their      
 school days.                          
   The two which came out top were     
 skipping and tickey.These are still   
 the most popular in the playground.   
   Any number of people may play       
 tickey.One person is "on", usually    
 the person who suggested the game.The 
 idea is to run faster than the person 
 that is on so he can't touch you with 
 his finger.If he does he is no longer 
 on,the person who has been touched is.
   There are many variations of        
 tickey,it is played in all kinds of   
 weather,but not when it's too hot.All 
 children in the school who are aged   
 7/11 seem to play tickey some playtime
 of the week.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
