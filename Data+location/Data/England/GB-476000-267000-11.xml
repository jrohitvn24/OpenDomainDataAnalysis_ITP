		<content>   The{Stud Farm}was purchased after   
 the Second World War by the nearby    
{Moulton College of Agriculture.}      
   It was originally built for Captain 
 Drummond, a friend of the Duke of     
 Windsor, as a model farm for horse    
 breeding during the 193O's.           
   Today the farm has{158 Friesian     
{dairy cows.}Winter housing is provided
 for the cows in a covered yard, and   
 the herd is milked through a 16 point 
 herring-bone parlour.                 
     A{pig}herd consisting of{1OO Large
{White and Landrace crossbred sows}are 
 housed in modern buildings which      
 include a farrowing pen. Food for the 
 pigs, using barley grown in the       
 surrounding fields, is prepared and   
 stored in a barn.                     
     The farm also has a Dutch barn to 
 store hay and straw and storage units 
 for liquid manure and silage.         </content>
