		<content> Joanne and I visited the Job Centre.  
 The manager answered some questions.  
 She  told us that about 15 young      
 people and about 15 people over the   
 age of 30 come in to the Job Centre   
 each day.                             
 Young girls usually want jobs like    
 shopwork, nannies or hair             
 dressing.Young boys usually want      
 factory work or farm work.The highest 
 paid local jobs are usually in        
 factories.On average 25% of people who
 come in have the qualifications.
