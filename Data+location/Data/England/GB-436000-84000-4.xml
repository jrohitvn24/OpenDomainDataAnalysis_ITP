		<title>04FARMING PROBLEMS.</title>
		<content>  The problems faced by the farmers of 
 the area are caused mostly by         
 wildlife.There is a large population  
 of rabbits which eat young vegetable  
 crops.The two main types of birds that
 are troublesome are crows and         
 pigeons.Both types excrete on crops,  
 preventing the farmer from selling    
 them.Pigeons also eat young cabbages, 
 as do pheasants.                      
  The farmers on the Isle of Wight     
 spend much energy on solving these    
 problems.Rabbits are shot and trapped 
 to prevent them from breeding.Birds   
 are discouraged by the use of         
 scarecrows,bright ribbons and dead    
 birds.At{DUNSBURY FARM}a bird-scaring 
 "cannon" has also been employed.In    
 Winter,there are also expeditions by  
 local farmers into the countryside.   
 These shooting parties kill for sport 
 and as a preventative measure.        </content>
