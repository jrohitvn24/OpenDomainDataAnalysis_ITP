 A number of inhabitants were born here
 in the early 1900's and look back,past
 the two World Wars,to a childhood that
 seems glowing,isolated and cheerful.It
 was possible to walk around the parish
 far more freely,along paths that led  
 through predominantly pasture land,to 
 the Fishpond beyond Warren Hill,for   
 instance,to bathe or to picnic.The    
 emotion is sharper than simple        
 nostalgia:mention is made of gaslight 
 and candles,fleas,earth-closets and   
 water carried from distant pumps,but  
 most old people would have no         
 difficulty choosing the hardships of  
 their childhood ahead of the          
 facilities of today as a preferable   
 life-style.It would seem that their   
 forebears{"knew the now lost secret of
{being happy on little"}to quote Flora 
 Thompson.                             </content>
