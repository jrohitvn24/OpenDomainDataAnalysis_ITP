		<title>07The Mop, Warwick.</title>
		<content> Every year for two weekends in        
 October, Warwick Town Centre is closed
 to traffic and a large fair or 'mop'  
 takes place. The origin of this fair  
 dates back to the plague of 1349 when 
 one third of the population of England
 died. This left a shortage of labour  
 particulary in the agricultural units 
 known as manors and caused a general  
 upheaval and movement of farm workers.
 To regulate this matter parliament    
 passed a statute stating that men     
 should attend at the nearest market   
 day to the end of Sept. To ply for the
 hire for the following year. Roasting 
 of an ox which is still carried out,  
 probably arose from the need to feed  
 such a large gathering of people and  
 following this, general festivities   
 took place.The runaway 'mop' was held 
 a week later to give men not yet hired
 a second chance.This tradition is kept</content>
