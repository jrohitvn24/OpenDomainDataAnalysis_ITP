		<content>  Today, most of our time was spent in 
 Low Hesket. We arrived outside the    
 Rose and Crown Inn, which is on the   
 main A6 road. There is a small Post   
 Office and Shop just up the road from 
 the Inn. The shop mainly sells sweets 
 and very few groceries. There is also 
 a Police House where the Policeman    
 lives with his family. We have seen   
 about five farms which are all set    
 back off the road. Low Hesket has a   
 Primary School which is very small.   
 We have only seen two buses today; one
 going to Penrith and the other one    
 coming back. The number of the buses  
 was 615. There is a public footpath   
 leading to Southwaite which is about  
 two miles away.
