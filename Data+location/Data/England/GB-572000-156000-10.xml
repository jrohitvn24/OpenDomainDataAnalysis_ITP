    The Royal British Legion Village is
 a small housing estate for ex-service 
 people, in the centre of the Kent     
 countryside at Aylesford. There are   
 shops and a community centre          
 there.They also have industries for   
 the people of the Estate and for many 
 disabled people.                      
    The Royal British Legion Village   
 was made after the First World War.   
 When the British Legion came to       
 Preston Hall Hospital in 1925 they    
 built the Village for the chest       
 patients to work in. In the village is
 also a poppy appeal office and        
 warehouse where all the poppies are   
 stored for Remembrance Day.
