In 1881 there were 18 Fishermen in     
Corton now there are just 5.Billy      
Rushmere,Geff Woolston,Garry Brown, Roy
and Mr.High are all fishermen.Most     
Fishermen go for Shrimps and Herring.  
The distance that Garry Brown goes out 
is 2 miles. They use a tractor to take 
their boats down to the beach.In the   
Summer they catch Shrimps.They measure 
them in 1 pint glasses, each 40p. They 
are caught in a net boiled and laid on 
marble. In the Winter they catch Cod,  
Whiting, Plaice and Herring. They catch
them with a long line with lots of     
hooks on.Each 25 hooks has an anchor.  
There are 500 hooks and 20 anchors. All
the fishermen are part-time. Everything
they catch is sold in Corton.
