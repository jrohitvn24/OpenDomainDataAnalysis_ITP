		<content>  The Church Primary School takes up   
to seventy children, juniors and       
infants aged five to eleven years. They
have three teachers with an additional 
teacher on two days. The school has two
prefabricated classrooms added.  The   
village hall is used for gym, and      
dinners provided from Littlebourne.    
After leaving primary school pupils    
travel to Aylesham for Senior School or
into Canterbury to Grammar Schools.    
Some children attend private schools.  
The school holds no traditional festi- 
vals but shares in those held at the   
Church.  Children join in the village  
customs of Mayday with May Queen and   
procession and Beating the Bounds of   
the parish boundary, both held about   
every five years. The Baptist Sunday   
School has a bonfire on 5th November.  
Witches are said to have been held in  
Bossington House awaiting trial.       </content>
