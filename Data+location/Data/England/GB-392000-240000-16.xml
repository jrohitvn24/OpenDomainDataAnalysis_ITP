		<title>16Spare time in Eckington.</title>
		<content>{David:-}In my spare time i like to go 
 down to the river and catch minnows,  
 water boatmen, and snails. I like     
 watching cartoons on TV like God-Zilla
 and Captain Caveman; I also like      
 helping Dad wash the car. Dad gardens,
 sleeps or goes to the pub in his spare
 time. Mum reads books in her spare    
 time, sometimes Mum and Dad go down to
 the river and walk or sit and watch   
 barges go through the locks.          
{Mark:-}In my spare time I ride my bike
 and watch TV. Blue Peter is my        
 favourite. I go to cubs and swim which
 are good fun. I also like playing the 
 piano.                                
 For Girls 9-10 years old, the most    
 popular spare time activity is        
 watching TV, then drawing and reading.
 For Boys 9-10 years old,the most      
 popular activities are watching TV,
