		<title>10HOUSING SURVEY:OGBOURNE</title>
		<content> The questionnaire was made to obtain  
 as much information as possible from a
 small number of questions about homes 
 and families.The questionnaires were  
 delivered throughout Mildenhall and   
{Ogbourne.}When they had been completed
 they were returned to school,left at  
 the village post office or collected  
 by pupils in the village on Wednesday 
 26th June.                            
 We worked in pairs and used Data      
 Sheets to record the responses by use 
 of tally marks.After we had collected 
 the data we presented it in graphical 
 form by use of pie charts,bar charts  
 and graphs.We did some of this in each
 village and some with the two villages
 to compare them.It was interesting and
 we think it will be useful as we hope 
 that people in the future will be able
 to find out about our way of life in  
 these villages in 1985.               </content>
