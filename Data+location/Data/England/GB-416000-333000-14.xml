 TO A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF THE     
 INHABITANTS OF BOYLESTONE.THE         
 FOLLOWING ARE CONCLUSIONS DRAWN FROM  
 THE SURVEY.                           
 MORE PEOPLE OWNED HOUSES OR FARMS     
 RATHER THAN RENTING THEM,WHICH PROVES 
 THAT THE MAJORITY HAVE A REASONABLE   
 AMOUNT OF MONEY.NEARLY ALL OF THE 11  
 PEOPLE QUESTIONED OWNED A CAR,AND MOST
 OF THEM HAD ENOUGH MONEY TO AFFORD A  
 HOLIDAY.TWO PEOPLE WENT TO EUROPE,ONE 
 TO THE U.S.A.AND THE REST STAYED IN   
 THE BRITISH ISLES.FOUR PEOPLE DIDN'T  
 GO ON HOLIDAY AND THREE OF THESE HAVE 
 LIVED IN BOYLESTONE FOR OVER SIXTY    
 YEARS AND SO THEIR AGE MIGHT DETER    
 THEM FROM TRAVELLING.ALSO THREE OF THE
 PEOPLE OWNED FARMS WHICH MAY HAVE MADE
 IT DIFFICULT TO HOLIDAY.THE PEOPLE    
 INTERVIEWED HAD ALL LIVED IN          </content>
