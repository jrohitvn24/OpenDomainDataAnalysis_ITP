		<title>15A FACTORY IN SOUTHTOWN</title>
		<content>   We visited one of the factories on  
{Harfrey's estate.}It is one of a      
 number of factories that provide      
 support for the North Sea oil and gas 
 rigs. My father is a mechanical       
 inspector at this factory. They make  
 submarines, marine cameras and sonar  
 fish. The factory is 12 years old and 
 employs 150 people.                   
   There are many different jobs to be 
 done such as welding, boring, milling,
 turning and electronics. The          
 submarines they make are of different 
 types. Some are manned while others   
 are remotely operated. One submarine  
 could cost Â£250,000. The factory has  
 its own test pool which is 12 feet    
 deep.                                 
   The submarines are sold to oil      
 companies, for oil rig repair and     
 maintenance, salvage companies and the
 navy.                                 </content>
