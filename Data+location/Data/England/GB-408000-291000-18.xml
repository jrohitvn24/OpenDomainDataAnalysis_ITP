		<content> Different family members have         
 different leisure pursuits.  All      
 listed watching T.V. and many listed  
 videos for watching hired films and   
 pre-recorded material.  Fathers liked 
 football, some liked fishing and going
 to Wales on trips.  Other fathers are 
 keen photographers.  The local pub is 
 popular with both parents.  Mothers   
 had more home-centred pursuits like   
 reading, knitting and sewing.  Some   
 went to Bingo.  The family made visits
 to the country at week-ends.  Young   
 people liked cycling and playing near 
 home as well as swimming and belonging
 to sports clubs e.g. Judo, Badminton  
 and Football.  All enjoyed music,     
 mostly pop.  Some belong to Brownie,  
 Guide and Scout groups.  Boys like    
 computer games and many girls like    
 Irish dancing.  Grandparents like     
 gardening.                            </content>
