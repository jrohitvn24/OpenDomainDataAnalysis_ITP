		<title>17A TYPICAL HOUSE IN COLEHILL.</title>
		<content> I live at 124 Bridleway, Bridleway    
 Park Colehill, Wimborne, Dorset. My   
 house is new and it is made from      
 bricks and the top is painted. It is a
 detached house with quite a big garden
 at the back and front. In the back    
 garden there is no grass, just mud,   
 but in the front garden there is      
 grass. In the back garden there are   
 four evergreen trees and in the front 
 there are three trees, but we do not  
 know what they are. Inside my house we
 have got a kitchen with fitted        
 cupboards and an oven. We have got a  
 lounge with a dining room at the end  
 with a serving hatch . We have got a  
 downstairs bedroom-study. Upstairs we 
 have three bedrooms, one bathroom and 
 three toilets. In the front garden we 
 have a garage and we have one yellow  
 car.
