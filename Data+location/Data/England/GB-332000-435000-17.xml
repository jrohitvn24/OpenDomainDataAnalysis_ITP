		<content>Commissioned in 1922 by Corporation the
park covers 288 acres. Until then the  
land had no trees or landscaping but is
now a remarkable combination of formal 
and informal gardens, play areas, lake 
and sports fields. The lake has boats  
for hire and is much used by local     
coarse fishermen. This has led to much 
debate because of the danger to the    
wildfowl although certain areas of the 
lake have been set aside for the birds.
The park also encloses the Cricket     
ground where County matches are played 
and an athletics ground. All the town  
bedding plants and floral displays are 
prepared in the park nurseries.  The   
residential drives which encircle the  
site were conceived as part of the     
original design and in an effort to    
retain the character of the land the   
whole park and its surrounds were      
declared a Conservation area in 1984.  </content>
