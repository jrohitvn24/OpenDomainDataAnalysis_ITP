		<content> This part of the Lake District        
 National Park is extremely picturesque
 and it follows that many of the       
 occupations are fitting to the area. {
{The National Trust}and{The Planning   
{Board}employ many people, and both    
 have information centres in Hawkshead.
{The Forestry Commission, The Slate    
{Quarries}and the{Council}are also     
 major employers. There are tradesmen  
 such as milkmen, joiners, decorators, 
 plumbers, builders, engineers,        
 mechanics and postmen. Hotel and cafe 
 workers, shop assistants and campsites
 all depend on tourism and some        
 employees are 'laid off' in winter.   
 There is a doctor, a butcher, baker,  
 hairdresser and many artists. A       
 chemist, post office, magistrates     
 court, two banks and many farms all   
 provide local employment. There are   
 also many retired people.             </content>
