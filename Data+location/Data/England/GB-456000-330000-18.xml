		<content> Every day {Mr. Joe Horspool, }the     
 master baker of{Ruddington }bakes 7000
 cakes and even more loaves of bread.He
 has 22 staff including many of his    
 relatives to help him and modern      
 machinery in a newly converted bakery.
{Mr. Joe Horspool }is a national judge 
 for baking competitions. When he      
 judges bread he looks at the crust for
 a good brown colour and then cuts it  
 open to see the texture of the bread  
 as there must be no large holes.      
{Mr. Joe Horspool }was made a Freeman  
 of the city of London because of his  
 long connection with the baking       
 industry.                             
 He has now opened a tea shop next to  
 his bakery and it is very popular both
 for eating and as a meeting place for 
 friends when they are shopping in the 
 village and workers from the offices  
 and small factories.                  </content>
