		<title>16A Visit to the Local.</title>
		<content>   No village would be complete with   
out its local. Dilhorne is no exception
for she has four Public Houses to chose
from. Each with their own identity and 
pesonal charms. Two cater for the      
locals and two for visits entering the 
village after a run out in the         
countryside. One of these is the       
"Charle Bassett", named after a local  
personality. Here in the garden the    
children can play in an old Mother     
Hubbard Shoe whilst the parents  enjoy 
a quiet drink.The publican informed us 
that about 90 people visited regularly 
and that the most common drink in      
winter was bitter,whilst in summer,    
larger proved the favourite. For       
children coke was the winner. The      
favourite bar meal was Scampi and      
Chips, followed by sandwiches. Out of  
interest we inquired about the cost of 
a drink and how much was drunk.        </content>
