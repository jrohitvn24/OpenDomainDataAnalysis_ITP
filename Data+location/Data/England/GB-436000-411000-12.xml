		<title>12Effects of Miners Strike</title>
		<content>    The strike lasted for 12 months.It 
 made many differences at home like we 
 couldn't have any spending money.We   
 did'nt go out for the day or go on    
 holiday.Miner's children had to go on 
 social security where we got free     
 clothes from a school in Barnsley.    
    We did not see much of our dads.   
 Some of them were picketing and       
 coaling.Each dad took some food with  
 him. They lit a fire and cooked the   
 food . Some worked at coaling (digging
 coal from illegal and disused sites)  
 while others rested.                  
    Every weekday in the school        
 holidays we had to go to the          
 comprehensive school or Meadstead     
 School for our dinners.The miners     
 wives raised some money going round   
 carol singing and used it for parties 
 and presents. Even though it is over  
 we still don't have much money.       </content>
