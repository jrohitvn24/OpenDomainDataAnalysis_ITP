		<content> Class 3 Juniors posted a questionnaire
 to each house in Oaks Rd. There were  
 26 houses on the north side of the    
 road. We asked why  they liked living 
 in Tenterden and about their everyday 
 lives. One large house had just been  
 converted into an old peoples home and
 as building was still in progress we  
 didn't collect much information from  
 them. However we did discover that    
 most  people in the road were retired.
 Only two families had young children. 
 Many had lived in Tenterden for over  
 10 years and thought it a very        
 pleasant town with beautiful          
 surroundings. Though they thought the 
 amenities were good and they did  a   
 little shopping for odd items each day
 locally, many shopped at the big      
 supermarkets in towns like Ashford or 
 Hastings, perhaps about once a        
 fortnight.                            </content>
