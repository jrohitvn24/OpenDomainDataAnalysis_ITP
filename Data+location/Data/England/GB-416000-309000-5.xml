Every year we have a May Festival at   
the Howard School.This year it was our 
62nd.We start off by processing through
village on two dreys pulled by trac-   
tors.Our parents,friends and other     
people in the village follow us,and we 
sing songs about the spring and may-   
time.It is really good fun.Each year   
the eldest girls in the school are may-
queens.I was a may-queen this year.We  
are flower queens.I was a "Foxglove."  
When we finish the procession we get   
ready for the crowning of the queens.I 
had two maids.One carried my purple    
sash,and one my crown.Then comes the   
may-pole dancing.All the juniors dance 
round the pole doing "Amo Amas",       
"Spiders Web" and "Six Plaits".The May 
Festival is a most enjoyable custom.
