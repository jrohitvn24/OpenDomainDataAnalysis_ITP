  Many children in Cannock are members 
of various clubs and associations. In a
survey carried out at Chadsmoor Junior 
school, 10 girls were Guides,30 were   
Brownies,21 boys were Cubs,3 were      
Scouts.                                
  A large proportion of children       
attended a youth club or sports club   
and even more were learning to play a  
musical instrument.                    
  Another group of children prefered   
outdoor activities ranging from B.M.X  
bike racing to fishing.                
  A number of girls and boys went to   
dancing class to learn anything from   
ballet to breakdancing.                
  On Sundays 47 of the children        
surveyed went to Sunday school on a    
regular basis.
