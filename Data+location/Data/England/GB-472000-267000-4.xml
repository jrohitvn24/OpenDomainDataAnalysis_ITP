		<content> DESPITE THE PROLIFIC QUANTITIES OF    
 RAIN WHICH SEEM TO FALL ON ENGLAND    
 THERE IS A PERPETUAL WATER SHORTAGE.  
 THIS IS CAUSED BY THE WASTEFUL WAY IN 
 WHICH IT IS USED BY THE AVERAGE       
 CONSUMER AND HIS FAMILY.              
 RATES OF WATER CONSUMPTION ARE        
 PRESENTLY IN THE REGION OF 180 LITRES 
 PER PERSON PER DAY AND RISING, SO THAT
 THERE IS A CONSTANT NEED FOR MORE     
 RESERVOIR CAPACITY.                   
 PITSFORD RESERVOIR, BUILT AS A        
 RESPONSE TO THIS NEED FOR INCREASING  
 AMOUNTS OF WATER PER PERSON, WAS      
 OPENED IN 1956 BY THE QUEEN MOTHER.   
 IN ADDITION TO ITS FUNCTION AS A WATER
 TREATMENT WORKS IT ALSO PROVIDES SUPER
 LEISURE FACILITIES IN THE FORM OF     
 SAILING,BIRD WATCHING,NATURE TRAILS,  
 FISHING AND A CONSERVATION AREA FOR   
 SEVERAL SPECIES OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS.
