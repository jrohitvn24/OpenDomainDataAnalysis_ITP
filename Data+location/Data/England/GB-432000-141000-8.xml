		<content>     The roads in the area are usually 
 fairly quiet, with the exception of   
 the Andover to Salisbury road (A343). 
 The majority of people own a car; in  
 fact a survey showed that over 40% of 
 the people we asked owned two or more 
 cars. Nearly 60% of these cars were   
 less than three years old.            
     The villages are served by three  
 different bus routes which pass       
 through the area. These are operated  
 by Hampshire Bus and Wilts and Dorset 
 which are part of the National Bus    
 Company. Approximately 35% of the     
 people we asked use the bus services  
 at some time, usually for shopping    
 trips.                                
     There are no train services in the
 area. The nearest railway station is  
 at Andover.
