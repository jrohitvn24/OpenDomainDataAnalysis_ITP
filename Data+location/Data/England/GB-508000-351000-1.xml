      Ruskington has a population of   
 almost 4000 people which gives it the 
 status of a small town.   The last    
 thirty years has seen a steady growth 
 in house building - unusual for a     
 rural village.  There are two         
 reasons for this; the local town of   
 Sleaford has been slow to release     
 building land, the Royal Air Force    
 have three large bases adjacent and   
 personnel from these require          
 accommodation. Both Ruskington and    
 Dorrington are situated on the fringe 
 of Lincolnshire's Fenland,the         
 surrounding area being flat and       
 intensely farmed. Characteristically, 
 the farmland is interlaced with man-  
 made ditches to assist drainage.{In   
{the original Domesday Book, Ruskington
{is featured as Reschintone.}
