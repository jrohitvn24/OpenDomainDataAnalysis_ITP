 8.208 km long.It was naturally        
 formed.There is not a lot of fish or  
 plant life because of the{pollution

 in it are prosecuted by the{Wessex    
{Water Authority}who look after the    
 brooks and rivers in Wiltshire.About

 through it in an hour.The pump house  
 is there to pump the sewage up the    
 hill.In the brook near Clyffe Pypard  
 there is chalk/greensand.After that it
 is mostly Kimmeridge Clay and Oxford  
 Clay.Near Bremhill it crosses         
 Corallion.Cowage Brook is a main
