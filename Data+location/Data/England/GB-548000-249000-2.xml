		<content>{Sawston Hall}was originally called    
 Pyratt's Manor. The present building  
 dates from the early 16th century. The
 1580 survey mentions two fishponds.   
 The moat on the south side of the wall
 is fed by springs. There is a mulberry
 tree in the garden and according to   
 family superstition a death would     
 occur in the Huddleston family if a   
 branch fell off.In the inner courtyard
 there is an underground well.         
 The garderobe is a first time         
 lavatory. There are three             
 priest holes: one near the            
 garderobe, one near Mary              
 Tudor's bedroom( she slept            
 there in 1553) and the main           
 one in the tower in the               
 courtyard, this being one of          
 the finest in the country. It was sold
 to the Cambridge School of            
 Languages in 1983.                    </content>
