		<title>16Fishing in the Lea Valley</title>
		<content>The Lea Valley has many good spots for 
fishing.It also has many decent fishing
tackle shops like Simpsons of Turnford 
and Arnolds.                           
Fishing is a popular sport in the Lea  
Valley and more clubs are opening with 
private waters that are regulary       
stocked with different breeds, such as 
pike and perch.One of the best fishing 
spots for producing large fish that is 
open to all members of the public is   
Fishers Green pits.Also just by the    
side of the pits is the River          
Lea.                                   
Beside Fishers Green is the            
Metropoliton Police fishing lake,but   
this is a private fishery.The North    
Met is also very popular and it lies   
east of the River Lea.Another spot is  
the boating lake down Brookfield       
Lane.The fishing season in the Lea     
Valley starts on the 8th of June.      </content>
