		<title>01 LIFE ON THE MARSHES.</title>
		<content>    All lands around Crowle were owned 
 by the Abbots of Selby, from Norman   
 times to the reign of Henry VIII. In  
 those days, much of the present land  
 around Crowle was either Forest land  
 or Marshland. Indeed, out of all the  
 land in our area, only{Cottage Farm}is
 recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086.
{Rainsbutt Farm}was covered with forest
 and the rest of the land was marshland
 and very often under water.           
    The marshes and forests supplied   
 the people with much that they needed.
 Rushes and hemp provided raw materials
 for baskets, wattle fencing, seats and
 ropes. The KIng's deer was often      
 poached in the forest while the       
 flooded marshes provided fish-roach,  
 perch, bream, eels and even salmon.   
 There was also plenty of wildfowl to  
 hunt: duck, geese, heron, curlew and  
 snipe.                                </content>
