		<title>10HEDGES IN ST.WENN AREA</title>
		<content>  When people build the hedges they    
 start with big stones at the bottom   
 and the stones get smaller as they go 
 up.                                   
  The hedges in{Cornwall}are built like
 a letter{A}.They have earth in the    
 middle for plants and trees to grow.  
 Grass and weeds would be able to grow 
 quickly from the earth inside the     
 hedge.                                
  Where the hedge has been built       
 for a long time you will not see any  
 stones because the plants and trees   
 have covered the hedge.Sometimes      
 cattle rub against hedges and they    
 bring down the earth inside.Then you  
 might be able to see stones in those  
 places.                               
  Many of the fields are very small so 
 the area has many lovely hedgerows    
 which are havens for wildlife like    
 plants,creatures and insects.         </content>
