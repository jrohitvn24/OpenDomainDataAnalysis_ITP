		<title>07    PAPER MANUFACTURER</title>
		<content>      Papyrus is a cardboard           
 manufacturer at Newton Kyme. It       
 produces only white card, often in    
 carton form, in different shapes and  
 sizes to sell to mostly food and drink
 companies. They make cartons for      
 chocolate manufacturers and frozen    
 food. For the Royal Wedding they made 
 a special box for Bell's Whisky.      
                                       
      About 180 people work for them.  
 The men work two days then have three 
 days off.  The first two days of work 
 are twelve hour day shifts. Then the  
 last two days are twelve hour night   
 shifts.  Papyrus provide their own    
 houses for the workers to live in. At 
 the factory they do not dye the boxes 
 but sell them straight to the buyer.  
 In the laboratory they test the card  
 to see if the card is the right       
 variety for the buyer.                </content>
