		<content>    Generally speaking,people who live 
 in this area,choose to do so because  
 they enjoy the countryside,with its   
 scenery,its peace and quiet and its   
 healthier air.They are prepared to    
 accept and live with the lack of      
 public services,the need to always    
 travel for life's necessities and the 
 harsh winter climate.                 
    Farmers and their families         
 constitute the majority of the small  
 population,the rest is made up from;a 
 few people who have bought property   
 with land which can accommodate their 
 business enterprises,such as a small  
 haulage firm,a handful of professional
 people who commute into the Manchester
 conurbation each day and the odd few  
 retired professionals.There are also  
 two families who live on the site of  
 the water treatment works,because the 
 men of the families are employed there</content>
