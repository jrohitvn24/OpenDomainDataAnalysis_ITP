		<title>09A DAY AT THE SEASIDE</title>
		<content> One day I went to the seaside for a   
 birthday treat. We went to            
 Scarborough. We set off. We made some 
 sandwiches to eat on the way we had   
 some coffee, tea and pop to drink.    
 Soon we came to a field with tables   
 and benches in it so we stopped and   
 had something to eat and drink. Soon  
 we set off again in about an hour we  
 were there. We got out of the car and 
 went to the swimming baths. I could   
 not swim so I got an air ring. We had 
 an hour in the swimming baths and then
 we went to the fair. I went on the big
 wheel and then we went on the beach to
 play in the sand and in the sea. Later
 I went to the remote control boats and
 put ten pence in it and started it up.
 Soon it was time to go home. When I   
 got home I watched the television and 
 then I went to bed.
