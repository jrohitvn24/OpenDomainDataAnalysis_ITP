		<title>19Toys in our homes</title>
		<content> Toys are great fun for children. You  
 can have dolls, box games, ball games 
 too. There are teddies which are like 
 dolls. There is leggo that you can    
 build with to make cars and models.   
 These are some of the toys I've got.  
 Guess Who is a game where you describe
 a person. Hangman is a box gane and   
 you make a word up and the person says
 the word. Fool is a box game and you  
 have some cards with people on going  
 to a party. Battle ships is a game    
 when you have some little ships and   
 pegs. Glow-worm glows in the dark at  
 night when you go to bed. His head    
 glows.{by Clare Bayley
