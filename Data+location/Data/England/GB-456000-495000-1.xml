		<title>01N Y Moors, Hasty Bank area</title>
		<content> The area is bisected by a section of  
 the escarpment of the Cleveland Hills 
 which rises steeply from the plain to 
 the north. The lower land i the north 
 of the area has mixed farming with    
 sheep farming predominating on higher 
 areas. The highest land in the area is
 open moorland with heather and bracken
 covering. Hill slopes have            
 coniferous-forested areas. Settlement 
 is sparce, being restricted to        
 scattered stonebuilt farmsteads with  
 red pantiled roofs. Farming and       
 forestry provide the only employment. 
 Easy access from nearby industrial    
 Teeside makes the car parkwith        
 seasonal refreshment hut at GR572035 a
 popular venue from which to explore   
 the area using the many footpaths both
 through the forsts and over the moors,
 to which there is open access.
