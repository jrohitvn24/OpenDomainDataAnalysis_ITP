		<title>19Weeds on the Farm.</title>
		<content>  The farmers spray their crops in     
 rder to improve their yield. A farmer 
in this area uses weedkiller twice in  
the Autumn and once in the Spring. The 
first spray kills the wild barley and  
the second kills the other weeds.In the
Spring he sprays any weeds he has      
missed and later he sprays a fungicide 
over the crops.This will cost him about
30 pounds an acre.                     
  He tries not to use pesticides but   
sometimes the aphids start to destroy  
the crops. In 1984 he had to spray all 
his fields but in 1985 he has only had 
to spray about 30 acres.               
  He has planted a number of trees on  
his land partly to discourage the      
growth of the weeds which do not grow  
well under trees. He has planted oak   
and ash trees this year and he is      
developing a three acre wood.
