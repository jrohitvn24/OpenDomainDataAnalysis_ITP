		<title>19My Nan</title>
		<content>  When I talked to my nan she told me  
 about my Great Grandfather.Harry      
 Cowley was a Brighton chimney sweep   
 who became a legend in his lifetime   
 fighting for the poor and homeless.   
  My nan's family were poor and ate    
 mainly stew,bread and dripping.One    
 Christmas they only had boiled        
 potatoes for dinner.There was no      
 Christmas tree only paper chains.     
  Nan often tells me about Harry       
 Cowley's funeral.Hundreds of people   
 attended and many more watched at home
 as it was televised.It was held at St 
 Peters Church where he laid in state  
 overnight.The procession passed       
 through Upper Gardner Street where my 
 Great Grandfather and Mother had a    
 market stall.He would be there every  
 Saturday in his bowler hat and bow    
 tie. When my Grandmother visits it    
 brings back memories of the 'Guvnor'. </content>
