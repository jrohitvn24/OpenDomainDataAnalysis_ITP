		<content> The first thing we came to was some   
 fields of{wheat.}The fields of wheat  
 are{sold for cash.}These wheat fields 
 belong to{I.C.I.}We saw lots of fields
 of{grazing}grass. Some of it was very 
 green and lush. Some of the grass was 
 very rough with thistles and nettles  
 growing in it. We saw some{pigs}in a  
 field next to{Poplar Farm.}Some of    
 them ran in and out of the{farrowing  
 huts. We can see{High Court Green Farm
 which is{derelict}but it is used for  
 keeping cows. There is some fields of 
 sheep grazing. We saw two tractors.   
 All the walls in this area are made of
 sandstone.{Moordale Beck}runs through 
 this area and forms part of the       
 boundary between two of the main land 
 owners.
