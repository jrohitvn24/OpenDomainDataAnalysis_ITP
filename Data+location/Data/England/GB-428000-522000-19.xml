		<title>19Aycliffe Village-old church</title>
		<content> Christianity was first established in 
 Aycliffe at a very early date,for two 
 great Synods of the Church were held  
 there in 782 and 789A.D.The Church at 
 that time was dedicated to St.Acca,a  
 local priest who became Bishop of     
 Hexham.At the time of the Reformation 
 it was re-dedicated to the better     
 known St.Andrew,Apostle &amp; Missionary. 
 The present Church was built in 1215. 
 The people of the village suffered    
 severely at the time of the Great     
 Plague and also at the time of the    
 Commonwealth,for many villagers who   
 were Royalists were executed by       
 Cromwell's troops.King Charles I      
 worshipped in the Church and,after the
 restoration of the monarchy,Charles II
 also worshipped there.St.Andrew's is  
 the Mother Church of St.Clare's of    
 Newton Aycliffe,which was built when  
 the new town was created.             </content>
