		<content> The physical features of our area     
 govern the type of farming to be found
 here. The land rises and falls steeply
 in places and much of the land is well
 over 200 feet above sea level. Apart  
 from one small area near Riber Castle 
 where corn and fruit are grown, the   
 majority of the land is used for      
 grass. Where possible the grass is    
 mown for silage or hay and used for   
 grazing. In rougher areas where the   
 soil is thin and there are rocky      
 outcrops the land is used for rough   
 grazing. There are also large areas of
 deciduous woodland. The majority of   
 farmers use the mixed farming methods,
 many keeping cows for milk on their   
 better pastures, rearing bullocks for 
 meat and keeping sheep on their scrub-
 land.
