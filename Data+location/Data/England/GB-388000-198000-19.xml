		<title>19DEVIL'S CHURCHYARD</title>
		<content> The Devil's Churchyard is just a piece
 of ground with nothing but trees on   
 it.  It is believed that the reason   
 for this is that people have tried to 
 build a church there three times, but 
 each time it fell down - the work of  
 the Devil.  My gramp (sic) has seen   
 the Devil's carriage, one misty night 
 when he was coming home from work he  
 was just passing the Devil's          
 Churchyard when a man dressed in red  
 ran out into the middle of the road.  
 He swerved to miss him, but when he   
 got out of the car there was no-one   
 there. My Gramp has never been near   
 there again, for he believed it was   
 the Devil.
