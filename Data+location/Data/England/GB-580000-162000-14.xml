		<title>14WALKING NEAR HARTLIP</title>
		<content>  Walking is popular around Hartlip ,  
 stimulated by the work of the Medway  
 Towns Footpath Group.The area is well 
 served with country lanes and a well  
 marked network of footpaths.There are 
 orchards of different types,mixed     
 farmland,a Nature Reserve,managed &amp;   
 unmanaged woodland.A wide variety of  
 plants can be found in the old hedges 
 &amp; verges,providing a habitat for many 
 creatures.There are attractive views. 
 The directness of the motorway        
 contrasts sharply with the wandering  
 country lanes.Several of the footpaths
 converge on Hartlip Church,a reminder 
 that although they are now mainly used
 for recreation,they grew up to serve  
 the needs of the community.There are  
 many attractive buildings and well    
 kept gardens to be seen in the area.
