		<content>  Other building materials: Pulborough 
 stone (hard sandstone with bands of   
 dark chert) and carstone, a hard dark 
 stone found in sandy soil.  Bog iron, 
 lignite and ironstone are plentiful.  
 Horsham stone used as roof-tiles from 
 Roman times, was exhausted many years 
 ago.There are few flint-built houses. 
   Gas is laid on only in the southwest
 corner in Gay Street as a continuation
 from North Heath; mains electricity is
 available throughout the area.  Farms 
 have stand-by generators, and the old 
 wind pumps are no longer in use.      
  A seismic survey has been carried out
 along the roads in connection with oil
 exploration;  it seems the Weald is to
 be a future source of oil.  Recently  
 Conoco have submitted applications to 
 drill for oil in several neighbouring 
 parishes; the first has been approved.
 This area will probably not escape.   </content>
