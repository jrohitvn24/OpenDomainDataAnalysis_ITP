		<title>18Churches and Chapels</title>
		<content>  There  is one church and three       
 chapels in our block. The church is   
 called St Columba's Church and is next
 to the school in Warcop. There is a   
 chapel which belongs to the church at 
 Blea tarn. The vicar is Rev. Peter    
 Norton, and he comes into school to   
 take assembly and work with the junior
 class once a week. Sometimes the      
 school puts on a service in the       
 church.                               
  There is a Wesleyan chapel in Warcop 
 and one in Blea tarn, made of         
 corrugated tin. Mr Peter Robinson is  
 the minister. The chapel holds a      
 Sunday School, run by Mrs Burton, who 
 drives the school taxi. There's also  
 the Band of Hope which meets in the   
 chapel. Each summer there is a Band of
 Hope demonstration at Appleby football
 field.                                
                                       </content>
