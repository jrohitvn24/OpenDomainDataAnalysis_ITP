		<title>13GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content> The area is between Oakham,Langham,   
 Ashwell and Burley,near the centre is 
 the crossroads where the Oakham to    
 Ashwell and the Langham to Burley     
 roads cross.Most of the land is       
 agricultural with grazing,cereals,and 
 oil seed rape,but from the crossroads 
 north on the left hand side are the   
 Cottesmore Hunt Kennels,and on the    
 right hand side going north are a     
 small housing estate,originally built 
 to house prison officers;Ashwell      
 Prison;and the maintenance depot for  
 Leicestershire County Council Road    
 Services Department.These three       
 features take up most of the land in  
 this area in a 'ribbon development'   
 which ends with a small Garden Centre.
 The Birmingham to East Coast railway  
 line runs through the area,and beside 
 this are the remains of the Melton    
 Mowbray to Oakham Canal.              </content>
