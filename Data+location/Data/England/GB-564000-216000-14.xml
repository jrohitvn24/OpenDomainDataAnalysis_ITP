		<content> A lot of people have{employment}away  
 in London, Chelmsford and other       
 biggish places. But the people who    
 work in the area mostly work on a farm
 and in pubs.                          
   We talked to Mrs. Burr who has lived
 in the village for a long time.       
 She went to{Ford End school.}She      
 remembered when she could play in the 
 road when there was no traffic but now
 we can not because there is a great   
 deal of traffic.                      
 There are a few old people in Ford End
 village that we can find information  
 from Mrs.Burr has lived in the village
 all her life.
