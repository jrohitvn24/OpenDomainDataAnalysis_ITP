		<title>12VICAR OF ST. OSYTH</title>
		<content> The vicar of St. Osyth likes living in
 this area because of the people. He   
 belongs to the Anglican Church and is 
 called Fr. Peter. He has travelled    
 round the world to ten countries and  
 has had a Parish somewhere else. Fr.  
 Peter lives near the Church and says  
 six masses in a week. The number of   
 people who attend mass in a day is    
 usually about fifty-five. While he has
 been a Vicar in St. Osyth he has      
 served at 789 weddings and 50         
 baptisms. His favourite T.V.          
 personality is Richard Baker and his  
 favourite sport is Rugby though he    
 never plays.                          
 His special place in St. Osyth is     
 Point Clear beach. Fr. Peter is a     
 happy Priest and very cheerful.
