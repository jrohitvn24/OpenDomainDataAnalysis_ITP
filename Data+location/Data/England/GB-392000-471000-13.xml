		<title>13DOMESDAY ARNCLIFFE</title>
		<content>   Arncliffe gets its name from the    
 Saxon word meaning "eagle" or         
 "falcon".  In the time of the Domesday
 Book, Arncliffe was referred to as    
 Arneclif or Erneclive.                
   The original settlement was probably
 Danish, though there may have been an 
 even earlier settlement, of which     
 there is now no trace or record.      
   After the Norman conquest, the land 
 was held by Roger Le Poitevin.   His  
 land in Arncliffe was held by a man   
 called Torfin, who had 4 carucates of 
 land.  This is equivalent to about 400
 acres.  Roger Le Poitevin did not have
 the land for long.  There is some     
 doubt as to the exact reason for his  
 losing favour with King William, but  
 his lands were passed into the hands  
 of the Percy family, who held them for
 many years.
