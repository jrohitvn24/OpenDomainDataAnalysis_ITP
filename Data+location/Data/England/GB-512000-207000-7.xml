		<title>07A Housing Estate in S.Albans</title>
		<content>   {New Greens estate}lies in the north
 of the city of St.Albans and is       
 bounded by the{A6,}a golf course,a    
 wood and a private estate.The {housing
 on the estate varies in different     
 areas in that some houses have larger 
 gardens and rooms than others.        
   There are {3 playgrounds or parks,} 
 two of which contain childrens' play  
 equipment.There are plenty of {bus    
{stops}dotted around the estate and the
{service}is reasonable, a bus arriving 
 every {20 mins.}New Greens is fairly  
 tidy and shopping facilities are quite
 good, though there is neither a       
 chemist's nor a butcher's shop,which  
 makes life more difficult for{elderly 
{people,}of whom there are over{200.}By
 New Greens Avenue is a small new      
 housing development.Harpenden Road is 
 very busy always,more so now the{M1   
{traffic}is being directed through it. </content>
