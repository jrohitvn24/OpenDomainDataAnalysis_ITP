		<content>  The area covers parts of three       
Anglican Ecclesiastical parishes, part 
of a United Benefice of five parishes. 
It is in the Diocese of Oxford.        
  Between the three churches there are 
two Communion services and an Evensong 
every Sunday. Daily in Turville Church 
prayers are said for PEACE and         
reconciliation which attract           
congregations from far afield.         
  In 1985, for the first time since the
Reformation, a Roman Mass was          
celebrated in Turville Church, coupled 
with a pilgrimage to and from Stonor,  
the home of a strong Roman Catholic    
family.                                
  The sizable Roman Catholic community 
worship in churches in neighbouring    
towns.                                 
  There is a United Reform Church in   
the neighbouring village of Hambleden  
for Non-Conformists.                   </content>
