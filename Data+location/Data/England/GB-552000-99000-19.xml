		<content> The present owners of this historic   
 house,mentioned in the Domesday       
 Book,have organised,since 1984, an    
 Annual Festival of Music in their 15th
 century Tithe Barn.Their aim is to    
 create a balance between attracting   
 enough financial sponsership to make  
 the event viable and not to over      
 commercialise the Festival. A summer  
 evening's programme at Charleston     
 Manor in 1985 included facilities for 
 picnics in the rose garden where the  
 Charleston String Quartet were        
 playing,prior to a recital by an      
 international artist such as Julian   
 Bream the celebrated guitarist.After  
 the concert,dinner was served by      
 candlelight in a marquee,while the    
 string quartet continued to play.An   
 Art and Sculpture Exhibition was held 
 during the Festival.The Great Barn is 
 also used by charities for fundraising</content>
