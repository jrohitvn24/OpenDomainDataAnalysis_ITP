		<title>09A Small Rutland Village.</title>
		<content> STOKE DRY is a small village with a   
 population of 60.There are  12 houses,
 mostly built of ironstone,2 of which  
 are farms,one a dairy farm and the    
 other arable.Three other families are 
 associated with farm work.The Manor   
 House has become a goat farm which    
 specialises in milk and cheese;and the
 occupants also operate a small caravan
 site overlooking the Eyebrook         
 Reservoir.There is also a home-based  
 company which runs a fleet of bulk    
 grain carriers.Other residents follow 
 professions which necessitate travel- 
 ling to work.There is no new property 
 but all existing houses have been     
 renovated.There are no shops or bus   
 service in Stoke Dry.The villagers are
 very community-minded,organising      
 events if a need arises.One third of  
 the people attend church services.
