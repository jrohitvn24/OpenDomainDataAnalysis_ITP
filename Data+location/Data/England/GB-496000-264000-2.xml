		<title>02 The Town of Rushden</title>
		<content>  A portion of Rushden's housing falls 
within the block, but the section it   
crosses clearly shows the town's growth
from oldest centre along Bedford Road, 
through terraced housed streets to some
recent estate developments.            
  The original town was sited in a     
valley, but a housing explosion in late
19th century caused the town centre to 
move as red brick terraced houses and  
associated shoe factories spread out-  
wards on either side of A.6. This shoe 
industry arose due to increased demand 
for shoes. Leather was supplied by the 
local tanning industry. Duchy land     
surrounding other towns and villages   
restricted their growth.               
  Rushden is now a densely populated   
area almost independent in its         
amenities, with ribbon-like development
stretching along Bedford Road, Newton  
Road and Avenue Road.                  </content>
