 altered in 1859.Thomas Webb was the   
 architect,building the house for John 
 Lothian Bell.The building later became
 a Doctor Barnardo's orphanage,called  
 Dame Margaret's Hall.It was named     
 after a lady called Margaret who once 
 lived in the hall.Another, one time,  
 resident of the hall was a lady named 
 Gertrude Bell, daughter of John       
 Lothion Bell.Gertrude was the first   
 woman to cross the Sahara Desert.     
   In July 1977 the hall became a      
 private school for maladjusted boys.  
 They are not local boys but come from 
 all over England and Scotland.Their   
 ages range from 12to16.They sleep in  
 dormitories.They have a recreation    
 room and a lovely television room.As  
 well as academic subjects, the boys do
 woodwork and gardening and keep       
 lambs,hens and rabbits.               </content>
