		<title>12Mining Visits.</title>
		<content> The first visit we went on was to{    
{Tolgus Tin,}even though it was out of 
 our twelve square area. Their end     
 product is tin concentrate. At the    
 moment they have four Cornish stamps, 
 and they were loud, at one time they  
 had 170 working at the same time. The 
 Cornish stamps crushed the rock.      
 The second visit was{Wheal Jane.}They 
 used shaking tables the same as{Tolgus
{Tin}does. The mine has 16 levels, and 
 400 people working at the mine. The   
 mine is 1500 feet deep. Then a man    
 took us to the laboratories, on the   
 shelves in the laboratories were      
 different chemicals, and rocks.       
 Our next visit was to{Camborne School}
 of mines, first we went in and looked 
 at the rocks, and there was a great   
 variety of them.
