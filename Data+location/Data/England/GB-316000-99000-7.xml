		<title>07Honiton Fair</title>
		<content> Honiton fair goes back to the 13C.    
 It is held on the first Wednesday and 
 Thursday after July 19th. On the      
 Tuesday before the fair the Town Crier
 Joe Lake proceeds along the High      
 Street with the Mayor. He carries a   
 pole wreathed in flowers  with a      
 gilded glove on top, and shouts 'Ye   
 fair is begun. Ye glove is up. No man 
 shall be arrested until ye glove is   
 taken down. God save the Queen.'      
  Hot coins are thrown from traditional
 sites in the High Street where        
 children scramble for them. Finally   
 the glove is hoisted outside the White
 Lion public house for the duration of 
 the fair.                             
  This year pennies were thrown by the 
 landlords and by Freeman Bill Tucker  
 and the Town Mayor Bill Cogger.
