		<content>  The girl said, that in the land where
 she came from everything was green    
 even the sky.She said that she and her
 brother had followed the sound of     
 bells into a cave and after a long    
 time they had found themselves at the 
 bottom of the wolfpits and staring at 
 them were strange pink men.The girl   
 wanted to go home but she couldn't    
 because she could not find the        
 entrance to the cave,although she     
 tried very hard.                      
 After along time the girl learned the 
 ways of the villagers and lost most of
 her green colour.She married and moved
 away but some say she can still be    
 seen searching for the entrance to the
 cave which would lead her home.       
 There are many stories like this all  
 over the world but this one did happen
 and you can read about it in our      
 church.                               </content>
