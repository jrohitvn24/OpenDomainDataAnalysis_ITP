  Our survey area is mostly{countryside
 to the{south of Yate,N.E. Avon.}There 
 are 3 villages.{Westerleigh,}the      
 largest,has a church,two pubs,two     
 garages,riding stables and a local    
 shop/post-office.With its church,old  
 schoolhouse and riding stables,{Wapley
 is now very small but was once more   
 important than nearby Yate and        
 Chipping Sodbury.{Parkfield,}a long   
 row of houses,used to house coal      
 miners.The mines are now long disused 
 as is the nearby old railway line.    
 There are 14{farms,}one of which has a
 large abattoir on its land.The busy{M4
{motorway}cuts right across the bottom 
 of our survey area but the nearest    
 access junction is a few miles away.  
 Country bus services go to both       
 Bristol and Bath.
