		<title>15AQUATIC LIFE.</title>
		<content> Although the spring had been one of   
 the wettest on record, most of the    
 ponds and streams were virtually dried
 up. (perhaps as a result of the       
 exceptionally hot summer last year.)  
 Examination of water from the few     
 pools remaining revealed little in the
 way of wildlife. This may have been   
 due to farming practices, (fertilizer 
 application etc.), or perhaps the     
 ingress of sea water from local       
 drains. (The area is very low lying   
 and it is not unusual to find         
 freshwater streams and saline drains  
 within 200m of each other.)           
 That local conditions in general are  
 capable of supporting varied aquatic  
 communities is proved by the fact     
 that a private pond surveyed contained
 a variety of tadpoles, newts, frogs   
 etc. Surprisingly, insect nymphs were 
 scarce.                               </content>
