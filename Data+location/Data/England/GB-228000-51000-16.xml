		<content> THERE ARE NO FORMAL PLAYGROUNDS FOR   
 THE CHILDREN.IN THE PAST OPEN FIELDS, 
 TO THE NORTH,AND THE SEA,TO THE SOUTH 
 HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED ADEQUATE.THE NEW 
 AND GROWING POPULATION HAVE DIFFERENT 
 NEEDS BUT THE OPTIONS ARE LIMITED.THE 
 SCHOOL FIELD CANNOT WITHSTAND FURTHER 
 USEAGE AND OTHER CLIFFTOP FLAT LAND,  
 HAS BECOME HOUSE SITES.THE PRESENT    
 STRUCTURE PLAN LIMITS EXTENSION OF    
 VILLAGES WHERE EMPLOYMENT IS          
 DIFFICULT.THUS THE REMAINING GREEN    
 FIELD SITES BY THE VILLAGE WILL NOT   
 EASILY OBTAIN FURTHER DEVELOPMENT     
 PERMISSION. IT MAY SOON BE POSSIBLE TO
 OBTAIN A VILLAGE GREEN,A TRADITIONAL  
 RURAL AMENITY NEGLECTED IN THE RAPID  
 EXPANSION OF DOWNDERRY.PLANS ARE IN   
 PREPARATION TO IMPROVE THE APPEARANCE 
 OF THE VILLAGE CENTRE BY SYMPATHETIC  
 BUILDING,PLANTING AND SOCIAL          
 MANAGEMENT.                           </content>
