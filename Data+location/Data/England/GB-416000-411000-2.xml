		<title>02THE CIVIC SOCIETY</title>
		<content> In Kirkburton there is a Civic Society
 and we interviewed a member of it     
 called Mr.C.Prior.The Civic Society is
 a group of people who are involved in 
 what the village looks like,they don't
 want anything to happen to it like    
 building extra houses when greenland  
 or trees could be planted.The Civic   
 Society plays an important part in the
 planning of Kirkburton like making    
 room for factories,car parks or       
 parks.In Kirkburton there is going to 
 be a Country Park.We asked him what he
 wanted the Country Park to look like. 
 He said it would have grassland,trees,
 bushes and footpaths by the river.It  
 will be about half a mile long and not
 very wide.The Civic Society had the   
 idea to build the Country Park because
 there was nowhere for the villagers to
 go to have peace and quiet away from  
 the roads.                            </content>
