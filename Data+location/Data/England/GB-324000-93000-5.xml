		<title>05HOUSING IN COLYTON</title>
		<content> Colyton is a very old village with    
 most of the houses being 500-600 years
 old. There are many interesting houses
 in Colyton, the biggest being Colyton 
 House which stands in the centre of   
 Colyton. It is surrounded by a 15-20ft
 wall. Another interesting house is the
 Vicarage which dates from the 16th    
 Century. Near the church there are    
 several old workers' cottages,some of 
 them dating back to at least the 17th 
 Century. Most of the houses are made  
 of local stone, as are the older      
 farmhouses in the area. Another       
 interesting old house is Oroolong     
 House in Queen Street, the home of    
 Captain Wilson, the discoverer of the 
 Pelew Islands. Several houses are     
 thatched. In recent years, 5          
 housing estates have been built on the
 outskirts of Colyton. A typical 3     
 bedroomed semi costs Â£35-40,000.      </content>
