		<title>04The Bridgewater Canal.</title>
		<content> The canal was built between 1759 &amp;    
 1766 and opened up the hinterland,    
 linking Manchester and Worsley to     
 Runcorn and the Mersey.A flight of ten
 locks dropped the canal 90 feet at the
 Runcorn end.Flats,wide and narrow     
 boats traded on the canal in raw and  
 manufactured bulk materials.          
 Today the flight of locks has gone and
 the canal ends at Waterloo Basin,it   
 has long since lost its commercial    
 value.Now it has found a new lease of 
 life as a leisure facility used by    
 pleasure craft both hired and         
 privately owned as well as being      
 popular with anglers fishing for carp,
 roach,perch and bream.It also provides
 a habitat for a wide variety of bird  
 and animal life,the most common being 
 mallard,coot and moorhen.
