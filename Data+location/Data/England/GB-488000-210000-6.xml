		<title>06Old People in Aston Clinton</title>
		<content>     An Aston Clinton old peoples club 
 has been formed so that many of those 
 who would otherwise not see many      
 people might meet on a regular        
 monthly basis. Every year the old     
 people are invited to Aston Clinton   
 School to be entertained and given tea
 by the pupils of the school. This     
 usually takes place at Easter         
 time, during the bad Winter weather,  
 many of the old are too frail to      
 venture out. Many of the old people   
 are keen gardeners and take part in   
 the local horticultural show winning  
 many of the prizes. They are very     
 proud of their gardens. A number of   
 the old people live in small          
 communities in the village. This      
 enables them to keep in close         
 contact with their own age group.
