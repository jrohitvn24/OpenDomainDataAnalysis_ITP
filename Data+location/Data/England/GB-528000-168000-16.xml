		<title>16Living in Norbury</title>
		<content> I live in a quiet,residential area    
 which consists mainly of              
 semi-detached houses,some of which are
 council owned. Many of the streets are
 quite attractive being lined with     
 trees which is pleasant in the summer.
 I do not have to travel far to school 
 since there are two to choose from in 
 the area and they are both lucky      
 enough to have large playing fields   
 attached to them. In the summer I     
 enjoy playing in Norbury Park which is
 very close to my parents' allotment.  
 Or sometimes my friends and I travel  
 along Green Lane to the large sports  
 ground where we can play tennis. If I 
 want to go shopping I have to travel  
 into Croydon because there are only a 
 couple of food shops in the neighbour-
 hood.  It can be too quiet living here
 sometimes.
