		<content> In the area of Preston Capes there are
 approx. 70 dwellings of which approx. 
 l2 are rented from either the Daventry
 District Council of private landlords.
 The well-kept gardens, lawns and      
 verges, make Preston Capes and Little 
 Preston attractive and sought after   
 villages despite the fact that there  
 is no main drainage, no mains gas -   
 bottled gas for portable heaters and  
 cookers is used by some people -no    
 street lighting, shop or public house.
 Oil, delivered by tanker is a common  
 form of central heating.              
 The village formed part of the Fawsley
 Estate until l932 when most of the    
 properties were sold, at which time   
 many of the houses had thatched roofs 
 although there are only two remaining.
 The area is now a Conservation Area.
