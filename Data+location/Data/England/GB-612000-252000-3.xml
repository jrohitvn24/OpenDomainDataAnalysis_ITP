		<title>03Leisure in Coddenham area</title>
		<content> Many of the recreational activities   
 enjoyed in this area take place in    
 the Village Halls at Coddenham and    
 Hemingstone. They include Girl Guides,
 a Youth Club, Women's Institutes, Over
 60s Club and Keep Fit. Hire charges   
 are reasonable. Football is played on 
 the Coddenham recreation ground where 
 there are also children's swings. The 
 local cricket team plays at nearby    
 Claydon. A Playvan and Mobile Library 
 regularly visit the villages. Many of 
 the local clubs are helped by yearly  
 donations from a Trust originally set 
 up by Lady Gardemau (1662-1757) to    
 help needy children in the area.      
 Coddenham Country Club (owned by its  
 members) is popular with many families
 where snooker, pool and darts can be  
 played. Horse riders are often seen.  
 Gardening is a popular pastime and    
 some gardens even have croquet lawns. </content>
