		<title>19It's a beautiful boy</title>
		<content> He has finally arrived!Cornwalls first
 test tube baby,Samuel Joshua Strick   
 bounced into the world at 2.15 on     
 Saturday morning a beautiful healthy  
 nine and a half pounder.              
 And for parents,Terri and Jimmy the   
 birth at Treliske Hospital Truro,ended
 nine long years of frustration and    
 anxiety, but both agreed he was well  
 worth the wait.                       
 Everything went well during the six   
 hour labour and Sams progress was     
 monitored every inch of the way.And   
 for dad Jimmy the moment of his       
 arrival was the culmination of all    
 their hopes and dreams.               
 Forgotten were all the problems they  
 had already had.Both Terri and Jimmy  
 were looking foreward to taking Sam   
 back to their home in St.Levan as soon
 as possible.
