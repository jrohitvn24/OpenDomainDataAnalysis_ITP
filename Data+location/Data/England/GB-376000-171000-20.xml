		<title>20TRANSPORT AND CREDITS</title>
		<content> TRANSPORT  The only services are bus  
 services.  Bristol Transport offer    
 seven buses daily to and from Bristol,
 and two buses daily to and from Bath  
 (with two extra on Fridays). A private
 local company runs one bus to and from
 Bath on Wednesdays, and another       
 operates a weekly service to and from 
 Chippenham on Fridays. Marshfield     
 residents are thus heavily dependant  
 on private transport, and many        
 families have two cars.               
 CREDITS   The survey was a            
 co_operative effort by many people    
 living in Marshfield.  It was         
 co-ordinated by the Marshfield Women's
 Institute, with assistance from       
 members of the Marshfield and District
 Local History Society. Thanks to      
 Marshfield Primary School for the loan
