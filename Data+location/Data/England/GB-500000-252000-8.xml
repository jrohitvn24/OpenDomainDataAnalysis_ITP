		<title>08The River Ouse at Clapham</title>
		<content>                                       
  The River Ouse is a nice river.   The
 river ends at The Wash.   It is very  
 old.   You can tell this by all the   
 bends in it.   There's another River  
 Ouse in York.   The River Ouse at     
 Clapham passes through lots of        
 counties.   These are some of them _  
 Beds., Oxfordshire, Bucks.,           
 Cambridgeshire and Norfolk.   The     
 Vikings used to sail along the river  
 Ouse.   People used the church to see 
 if the Vikings were coming.   The     
 Vikings got out of their boats at the 
 ford.   A ford is a place where the   
 water is not very deep and farmers    
 used to take the cattle across it.   A
 few people go fishing because there   
 are lots of fish in the river.   I    
 know who goes swimming in the river.  
 I like the River Ouse because it is   
 not noisy.                            </content>
