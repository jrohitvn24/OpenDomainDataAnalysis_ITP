		<title>08WET-LANDS OF THE RIVER ARUN</title>
		<content> The eastern edge of Arundel Park forms
 a sheer drop to a narrow road below. A
 dis-used chalk quarry is detectable   
 towards the end of this deciduous     
 tree-clad hanger. This open road from 
 Arundel runs beside the Wildfowl Trust
 and its accompanying car-parks.       
 Uncultivated wet-land, drained by     
 dykes border the road leading to the  
 Black Rabbit Inn on the banks of the  
 river Arun. This river flows past     
 Offham, upstream to South Stoke and   
 beyond. Wet-land borders either side  
 of the river. Drained by dykes, it    
 affords grassland and grazing for     
 cattle. As the ground rises toward    
 Arundel Park  arable and pasture land 
 intermingle. A few houses cluster near
 the pub, Offham has a dozen or so, two
 nestle down near the Arun. Crops and  
 cattle rather than people.
