		<content> Lincs. farmers' wives lead a very     
 different life from that of 50 years  
 ago.Today they live in labour saving  
 houses with every modern convenience. 
 Domestic help is scarce,but with elec-
 tricity,piped water and the telephone 
 life is much easier than it ever was, 
 but life on the farm is still busy.Chi
 -ldren living in rural areas have to  
 be taken to and from school.Apart from
 routine housework, visits to the near-
 est town for shopping and farm buisn- 
 ess, the farmers' wife finds time to  
 participate in local activities,e.g.  
 P.T.A, church life,W.I.,flower clubs  
 and farm women's clubs.Some sit on    
 local councils and on school governing
 bodies.Some help on the farm in the   
 busy time,others when the family is   
 grown up and independent take up      
 professional,part time or voluntary   
 work.                                 </content>
