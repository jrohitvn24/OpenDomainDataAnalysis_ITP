The education in our village is of a   
very high standard.There are three     
teachers and one secetary who are all  
very kind people.We are taught to play 
different musical instruments such as  
the violin,the recorder and the cello  
and we are taught different songs.When 
we do concerts Mrs.Bates arranges for  
us to go and entertain the old people. 
They always enjoy it.We visit Tamworth 
baths every Wednesday,for lessons.Once 
a year all the schools compete against 
each other in a swimming gala.For the  
past four years our school has won.    
Every week we do English,Maths and     
scientific work.After our fantastic    
education at Elford school we can      
either Lichfield or Tamworth school.We 
also go on educational trips that are  
always exciting.
