		<content>  This area of Hampshire is situated   
 between the ever growing suburbs of{  
{Winchester}and{Eastleigh}. It is      
 comprised of undulating countryside   
 around{Hursley}and{Pitt Down}. It is  
 farming country , mostly owned by one 
 farm . To the south-eastern corner of 
 the area is the little hamlet of{     
{Standon}lived in only by farm workers.
 Just outside the area is the nearest  
 village , that of{Hursley}, which is  
 dominated by an International Business
 Machines complex in the old Hursley   
 Manor . The area we are dealing with ,
 has only a few farms , and an         
 sixteenth century mansion , called    
{Merdon Manor}, on the chalk grassland.
 Two thousand years ago the situation  
 was different , as there is an Iron   
 Age Fort ,{Merdon Castle}. So , the   
 area is sparsley populated , farming  
 is the only industry .                </content>
