		<title>06HORSES AND THE BLACKSMITH</title>
		<content>A livery stable which accommodates 28  
horses at present lies on the outskirts
of Shareshill.As well as looking after 
all these horses the owner works a     
small arable farm,grows all his own    
hay and still finds the time to        
organise 7 horse shows every year.These
include both show and jumping classes  
and are very popular with riders living
in the Midlands.The horses in the area 
are well served by a blacksmith at     
Little Saredon.He started work there as
a lad of l2 in l928 when his duties    
included shoeing the 36 farm horses in 
the area and repairing farm implements.
Today he and his two assistants are    
responsible for shoeing 25O riding     
school and privately owned ponies.He   
also fashions hanging baskets,door     
knockers,bootjacks and wine racks out  
of disused horseshoes.
