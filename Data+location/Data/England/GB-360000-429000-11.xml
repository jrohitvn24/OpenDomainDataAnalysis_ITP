		<title>11RECREATION AT SAMLESBURY SCH</title>
		<content>  At playtime we play on the playground
and on the field when it is dry. Games 
have their seasons and, suddenly, every
one starts something new. On the field,
we play football and a sort of rugby.In
the summer we have races and swingball.
During Wimbledon fortnight tennis is   
popular. If we cannot go on the        
field,we play Hopscotch, Ball tag,     
Poison Pot and Rats and Rabbits. Our   
favourite game is British Bulldogs.    
One person carries another on his back 
and you try to attack other pairs. It  
is exciting and a bit rough.           
  The younger children play with some  
dolls called "My little pony". They    
also play families with the girls. We  
do things like picnics and family out- 
ings. We usually have lots of kids and 
they are very mischievous.
