		<title>14Archaeology Around Garton</title>
		<content> There is every reason to believe that 
 the area has had continuous settlement
 since pre-historic times.Flint arrow- 
 heads,scrapers and stone axe heads are
 sometimes found after ploughing.A     
 valley known as Garton Slack has      
 yielded considerable evidence of      
 occupation from Neolithic to Anglian  
 times.                                
 Some spectacular Iron Age chariot     
 burials,belonging to the Arras culture
 were excavated in 1971,1984 and 1985. 
 A Romano-British house and inclosure  
 date from the 2nd &amp; 3rd Centuries. A  
 large Anglian cemetery discovered in  
 the south-east of the parish consisted
 of two groups of graves,one pagan and 
 the other christian.                  
 In l985 a team from the British Museum
 excavated a one acre site close to the
 village.An Anglian cemetery was found 
 on top of Iron Age chariot burials.   </content>
