		<content>BLEWBURY'S HISTORY IS LOST IN ANTIQUITY
ON THE SOUTHERNMOST PARISH BOUINDARY,  
HIGH UP ON THE DOWNS,THE ANCIENT       
RIDGEWAY FORMED PART OF NEOLITHIC MAN'S
TRADE ROUTE FROM GRIMES GRAVES IN      
NORFOLK TO AVEBURY,STONEHENGE AND      
BEYOND.A LOWLAND DIVERSION FROM THIS   
ROUTE-THE ICKNIELD WAY-PASSES THROUGH  
BLEWBURY ITSELF,AS THE HOUSE NAMED     
"ICKLETON"BEARS WITNESS.THE PRESENT    
SETTLEMENT GREW UP ALONG THE EDGE OF   
THE CHALK DOWNS WHERE THE SPRINGS RUN  
OUT INTO MAANY LITTLE STREAMS.IT WAS   
DESCRIBED AS "VENERABLAE"IN A SAXON    
CHARTER OF 944 AD.BY DOMESDAY THE      
VILLAGE BOASTED FOUR MILLS AND WAS     
DIVIDED INTO THREE MANORS-GREAT MANOR, 
NOTTINGHAM FEE,AND THE PREBENDAL MANOR 
BELONG TO THE CHURCH.AGAIN MANY OF THE 
PRESENT HOUSE NAMES BEAR WITNESS TO THE
VARIOUS MANORS.
