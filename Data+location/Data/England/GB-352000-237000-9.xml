		<title>09A Mixed Farm.</title>
		<content>    We visited one of the farms in     
 the{Rotherwas area.}The farm is       
 typical of farms in Herefordshire,    
 being a traditional{mixed farm.       
                                       
   A variety of{poultry}is kept for    
 meat and eggs  , this being part of   
 the farm's income.                    
                                       
  Other livestock kept include{pigs}and
{sheep}as well as a dairy herd of      
 approximately 50{Friesian cattle.    }
                                       
   The recent milk quota cuts imposed  
 by the E.E.C. have caused a lot of    
 uncertainty among farmers. Perhaps the
 more traditional farms are more able  
 to cope with the future uncertainty,  
 because they do not have to rely on   
 one particular crop or produce.
