		<title>16Scotch Corner Hotel</title>
		<content> Scotch Corner takes its name from an  
 old Roman road called Scotts Dyke. The
 Scottish border farmers used to bring 
 their sheep here to market and it was 
 the most southerly place that these   
 farmers travelled to. It was and still
 is an important road junction for     
 transport with the main trunk roads   
 linking Scotland with England and East
 Coast with West Coast.                
 The{SCOTCH CORNER HOTEL}occupies a    
 prominent and elevated site, the      
 original building dated from the mid- 
 16th Century whilst the present hotel 
 was built and opened in June 1939. It 
 has undergone internal refurbishment  
 since then. It was previously named   
 the Three Tuns Inn and was a coaching 
 inn where teams of horses were changed
 on long journeys and travellers rested
 and dined. There is a picture in the  
 hotel showing it as it was in 1890.   </content>
