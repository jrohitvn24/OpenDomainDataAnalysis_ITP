		<title>17My Estate</title>
		<content> My estate in Camberley, with five     
 roads in it and a railway track at the
 bottom of one of the roads, houses    
 several different age groups, ranging 
 from seven months to eighty-two years.
                                       
 The estate is popular because it is   
 quiet, near the town centre, near     
 shops, schools, and the sports centre.
 The houses are mostly{3 or 4 bedroomed
 with a living room, small dining room 
 and a kitchen. We all have{two toilets
 and fairly large gardens.             
                                       
 The inhabitants of the estate like    
 animals and have{pets}such as fish and
 tortoises.                            
                                       
 Most of us children don't have to walk
 very often, because everybody has at  
 least one{car}and usually two or      
 three.                                </content>
