		<title>13Recreation in Newburgh</title>
		<content>        The Leeds-Liverpool Canal which
 lies near to Newburgh is used mainly  
 for pleasure craft and country walks, 
 and there is also a sports field, the 
 King George V Memorial Field, donated 
 after the Second World War. Newburgh  
 won the Best Kept Village competition 
 in 1984 and the Red Lion won a        
 certificate for the best public house.
 The primary school won certificates   
 for a Flora and Fauna competition. All
 these would show how the residents    
 care for the appearance of their      
 village.                              
         Newburgh has an annual fair in
 Summer, sponsored by a local club, and
 at Christmas  a fir tree is placed on 
 the village green and decked with     
 lights. The green is used for church  
 gatherings on special occasions.      
         The centre of the village has 
 been designated a conservation area.  </content>
