		<title>14RECREATION - WEST LEOMINSTER</title>
		<content>    There are no public facilities     
 for recreation within the area and any
 recreation is participative rather    
 than of the spectator variety.        
   A number of fishing clubs fish the  
 rivers and day licences are available 
 in many places.                       
   The Radnor and West Herefordshire   
 and North Herefordshire Hunts hunt the
 countryside.  There is private        
 shooting which covers most of the area
 and a fair amount of poaching is known
 to take place.                        
   Riding classes are held locally and 
 many people own their own ponies and  
 horses.  There is an annual           
 Point-to-Point held at Cursneh Hill on
 May Day Bank Holiday, which attracts  
 people from outside the area.         
   A number of local teams enter the   
 annual raft race on the River Wye from
 Hay-on-Wye to Chepstow, for charity.  </content>
