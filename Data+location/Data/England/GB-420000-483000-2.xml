		<content> The village is like a history book.It 
 dates back to the time when the first 
 Domesday book was written in 1086.    
{Thornton Watlass}was then two         
 villages, Thornton and Watlass.The    
 village Thornton got its name because 
 of the thorn trees and Watlass because
 there was no water in the village.    
 Watlass means 'waterless'.The nearest 
 water supply was just out side the    
 present village.                      
                                       
                                       
 The present village is situated around
 a village green.In the centre is a    
 large tree called the stock tree,     
 named after the stocks which used to  
 be on the green.The cricket pitch is  
 there.The village hall faces the stock
 tree.It is used for parties and       
 clubs.Most of the older houses facing 
 the green are stone.                  </content>
