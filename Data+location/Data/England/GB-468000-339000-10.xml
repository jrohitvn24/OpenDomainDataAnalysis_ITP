		<content>    Bingham Leisure Centre can offer   
 sports for every age all year round.  
 There are more than 20 sporting       
 activities including tennis, squash,

 badminton, football, etc. Following   
 are a few comments from chidren about 
 the use of the centre:-               
    "I like going to gym because there 
 are horses to jump on, bars to swing  
 on, steps to climb on and mats to play
 games on. Some people have their      
 birthday at gym." (6 yr. old)         
    "I like swimming because it        
 refreshes you and you have a good time
 and you can have a shower and get     
 warm." (6 yr. old)                    
    "What I like is playing football   
 and cricket because I am very good at 
 hitting the ball with the bat.I am not
 so good at football because sometimes 
 I win and sometimes I lose."(6 yr.old)</content>
