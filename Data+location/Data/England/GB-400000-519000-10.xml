		<content> After assembly it is Maths, English   
 or Composition.  At playtime - 10.30  
 am - we do Social Studies - History,  
 Georgraphy and Environmental Studies  
 until 12.15 pm.  We have dinner at    
 school which is cooked in the school  
 kitchen.  We eat it in the Hall.  I   
 sit with 5 other children and help    
 serve their food.  After dinner       
 there is a 30-minute break and        
 lessons begin at 1.15 pm.  During the 
 afternoons we play games - football,  
 rounders and netball, do Art and      
 Craft, Home Economies and Topic.  We  
 have a 10-minute break and go home at 
 3.30 pm.  I go back to the hotel by   
 taxi and my mother takes me home. I   
 play outside with my football until   
 Juliet comes home, then we have tea.  
 I stay inside and watch TV until my   
 bedtime at around 9.30 pm.
