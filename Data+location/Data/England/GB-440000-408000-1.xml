		<title>01Grimethorpe</title>
		<content>  Grimethorpe is a rural village with  
 industry. It is said that it is the   
 most heavily industrialised village in
 Europe. All the industry is           
 concentrated in the southwest corner  
 of the village where you will find ,a 
 deep mine ,a drift mine (linking      
 Grimethorpe to other deep mines)one   
 power station ,a Coalite and chemical 
 plant,a huge coal preparation plant,  
 and a brickyard.Four hundred metres   
 towards Shafton lies the N.C.B. area  
 workshops and stores.                 
  It is difficult to state the exact   
 population of Grimethorpe as the      
 census figures are always given as    
 Brierley with Grimethorpe but a good  
 guess would be 5000.The population was
 quite small until 1893 when the shaft 
 of the first deep mine was started.The
 population has grown steadily and now 
 is greater than that of Brierley.     </content>
