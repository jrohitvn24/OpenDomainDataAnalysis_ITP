		<content> The A357 Sturminster-Stalbridge road  
 crosses this area roughly S to N with 
 Waterloo Lane branching off westwards.
 Caundle Brook flows W to E in the     
 south of the area.Rough enclosed grass
 land is grazed by a flock of 120 ewes.
 Better pastures northwards support a  
 dairy herd.The north-east area is open
 grassland and gardens belonging to a  
 large private estate.No farming.      
 Very few people live here,no retired  
 folk.Two children go to school in     
 Sherborne.Some people work locally on 
 the dairy and beef farms.Others travel
 outside to work professionally.       
 This area has a private bus running   
 from Shillingstone to Sherborne thrice
 daily but every householder needs his 
 own car to make life easier.          
 With no amenities this is not an area 
 to attract the elderly for retirement 
 nor young couples with children.      </content>
