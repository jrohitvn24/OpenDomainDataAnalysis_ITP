		<content>   Both {East Barkwith }and {South     
{Willingham}have a{sub-post office,    
 which pays old-age pensions,and family
 allowances; where you can pay phone   
 and electricity bills; and which deals
 with letters and parcels. Both post   
 offices are in{small general stores,  
{selling}mainly food, with a few other 
 items like torch batteries, string and
 sewing thread.                        
   There is a firm, in the old railway 
 station at South Willingham, which    
 makes fibre-glass {bathroom furniture.
 In East Barkwith, there is a small    
{building firm,}consisting of the owner
 and two or three employees.           
   The other major industry is         
 agriculture, but this does not employ 
 many people. Most farms are worked by 
 the farmer and one other man. The     
 majority of people in these villages  
 have to go elsewhere to work.         </content>
