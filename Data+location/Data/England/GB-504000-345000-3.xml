		<content>{WEIR                                  
   There are two weirs.One which is    
 near Cogglesford Mill,and the other   
 which is near the new car park in     
 Southgate. The Cogglesford Mill weir  
 is quite large while the car park weir
 is small.                             
{The River Slea}                       
 The river itself has a lot of weed at 
 the bottom.It has a water mill called 
 Cogglesford Mill.There are two swans  
 that nest in the river. When the river
 comes to Cogglesford Mill it divides  
 into two.                             
{The Swimming Pool}                    
 The swimming pool which is next to the
 river Slea was converted into an      
 indoor pool roughly a year ago.There  
 is a large and a small pool.Only the  
 large pool is covered.There are also  
 food and drink facilities.
