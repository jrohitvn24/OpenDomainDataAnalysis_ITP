		<title>12Denmead Sub-Power Station.</title>
		<content>  A very visible feature on the skyline
 of this area is the Southern          
 Electricity Generating Board's        
 (S.E.G.B.) Lovedean Sub-Power         
 Station. This can be seen from most   
 parts of our area.                    
  We asked the S.E.G.B. for information
 about the sub-station but they did not
 give it to us so there is very little 
 that we can say about this feature.   
  However, we can say that it is the   
 main junction for power for much of   
 south-east Hampshire. It does bring   
 down the rates for the homeowners of  
 Denmead.                              
  Many people would claim that this is 
 not a pleasing sight in such enjoyable
 countryside and spoils the            
 environment. A feature that has such  
 an effect on the people of this area  
 could not go without mention.
