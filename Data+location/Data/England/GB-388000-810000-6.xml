		<title>06LIVING IN DYCE.</title>
		<content>  Recently the private part of Dyce has
 deteriorated.This happened because of 
 vandalism. This may be because both   
 parents usually work &amp; do not care    
 what thier children do.               
  House prices have risen in Dyce. e.g.
 in 1978_79 a house would have cost    
 Â£35,000.Now this costs Â£78,000.This   
 has happened because Dyce Shopping    
 Centre,the airport, and the station   
 have opened.                          
  Some houses are very old.One person  
 has to walk down 32 stairs to his toi-
 let.Another street is 150 years old.  
 These houses are crumbling down are   
 about to be demolished.The main street
 of Dyce looks very old fashioned.Some 
 of the houses were built in the 19th  
 century.                              
  One house has a secret passage       
 leading from one bedroom to another   
 from a cupboard.It was once a stable. </content>
