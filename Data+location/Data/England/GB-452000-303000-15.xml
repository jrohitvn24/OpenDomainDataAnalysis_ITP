		<title>15EDUCATION IN THE AREA</title>
		<content> This is a brief description of the    
 Education System found in the area.   
 Playgroups have been set up for the 3 
 to 4 year olds,these are usually      
 voluntary run schemes.                
 The next step can be the Nursery      
 Schools taking 4 to 5 year olds.These 
 are professionally staffed by teachers
 and nursery nurses.                   
 Infant and Junior Schools come next   
 taking the 5 to 11 year old pupils.   
 Leicester then has two types of       
 secondary schooling                   
 1.The Middle School(High School)      
 system this takes the 11 to 14 year   
 olds.No external examinations are     
 taken.                                
 2.Finally there is the Upper School   
 taking 14 to 18 year students.        
 However there still exists some 11 to 
 16 year old Schools and Community     
 Colleges in the inner City area.      </content>
