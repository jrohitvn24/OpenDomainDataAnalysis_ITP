		<title>10A Day In The Life Of Fiona 1</title>
		<content>                                       
  Fiona aged nine lives in Orlingbury  
and goes to school in Little Harrowden 
each day .We asked her how she spent a 
typical day." I get up at 7.30.a.m.I   
have a wash and go down stairs for     
breakfast .After breakfast I go and    
dress for school." "At 8.10 I leave    
the house to go and wait for the school
bus on the green." "When I arrive at   
school I wait in the playground until  
school starts." "After assembly lessons
begin, first we have maths and then    
silent reading." "After play I had     
mental arithmetic then we wrote our    
spellings down." "At 12.00 we had      
dinner." "After dinner we had art      
and then we had playtime,"We wrote a   
story after play and at 4.00pm school  
finished and I caught the bus home."   
 Fiona told us that she watched        
television until 5.00 when she had tea.</content>
