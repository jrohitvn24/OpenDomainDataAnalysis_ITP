 north-west of the city of{Kingston }  
{Upon Hull.}This city is not mentioned 
 in the original{Domesday Survey}but   
 trhere was probably a small trading   
 setlement on the north bank of the    
{Humber}called{Wyke.}This was developed
 by the monks of{Meaux Abbey}to export 
 wool. In{1293 Edward 1st}bought the   
 land from the monks and in{1299}      
 granted it a{Charter}and its present  
 name.                                 
   This area consists of{Victorian and}
{20th century development}and is mainly
{residential,}but about 15% of it      
 remains as{farmland}and there is a    
 good deal of land given over to{light}
{industrial usage.}In the north-east of
 the block lies the region's premier   
 academic institution -{Hull University
 and part of the{College of Higher}    
{Education.}                           </content>
