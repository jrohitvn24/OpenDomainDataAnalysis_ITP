		<content> Tourism plays a very important part in
 Silloth.Silloth was meant to be a busy
 port to serve  Carlisle,  and was also
 planned to become a holiday town.Self_
 catering holidays bring many people to
 Silloth in the summer. The two largest
 caravan parks are{Stanwix Park}and{The
{Solway Lido.}                         
 Stanwix Park  was first established in
 West Silloth  in  1937  by{ Mr. Hilton
{Stanwix}on part of his farm.   When he
 died his two sons{Roland}and{Eric}took
 it on.  People took their own caravans
 and put them in their fields. The sons
 started to develop the site  beginning
 with a paddling pool  and swings.  Now
 they have an  open - air swimming pool
 with a sunbathing balcony, pony rides,
 crazy golf,windsurfing,tandems, BMX's,
 putting green and play area with slide
 swings, roundabout etc.   There are 28
 apartments and 200 caravans.{Cont'd.  </content>
