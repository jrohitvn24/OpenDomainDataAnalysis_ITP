{Angrove Farm}is 1.50km N.E.of{        
{Rodbourne.}The farm is in a hollow and
 is farmed by {Mr. and Mrs Parfitt }and
 their two sons . It is 204 acres of   
 grassland and they keep between 120   
 and 230 beef cattle.They cut just     
 under 80 acres of silage and a few    
 acres of hay and the rest of the grass
 is for grazing. They do not farm the  
 land intensively because they do not  
 want the land to get tired. They put 2
 cwt of complete fertiliser per acre on
 the 80 acres of grassland on low      
 ground near the river. They use 4 cwt 
 per acre on the grass cut for silage. 
 More cattle are kept in winter than   
 summer. It has been a bad winter and a
 wet spring this year.{Market price for
{beef is Â£50 per cwt.}Their beef cattle
 sell for between Â£300 and Â£550 each.
