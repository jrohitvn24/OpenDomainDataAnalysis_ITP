		<content>   Woodgate Hill has 2 reservoirs. The 
 smaller of these is No.1 which holds  
 14 million gallons of water. No.2 is  
 much larger. It was built in 1959 and 
 at the time of building wasthe largest
 covered reservoir in Britain. It      
 covers 10 acres and is 1215 feet by   
 250 to 600 feet wide. It is 20 feet   
 deep.  It has been calculated that the
 total excavation was about 500,000    
 cubic yards. To build this reservoir  
 24,000 tons of sand were used, 57000  
 tons of stone and 12500 tons of       
 cement.                               
                                       
 This No.2 reservoir is covered by a   
 concrete lid which in turn is covered 
 by a grass top. It holds about 60,000 
 gallons of water.
