		<title>12Birdingbury Hall</title>
		<content> Birdingbury Hall is situated at the   
 edge of Birdingbury village,over      
 looking the River Leam.This 350 year  
 old hall is owned by Pirbic Midlands  
 Limited,who use it as a Management    
 Training Centre.People come from all  
 over the Midlands to use the hall and 
 Pirbic employ forty people.As the     
 village of Birdingbury is so isolated 
 the only means of transport is by car,
 although one employee comes on her    
 motor-bike.The Hall is set back in its
 own private grounds,which are         
 beautifully laid out and kept by a    
 handful of dedicated gardeners.The    
 grounds are open once a year to the   
 villagers who hold their annual Garden
 Fete on the last Saturday in June.
