		<content>     Church going has drastically      
 declined in recent years. The local   
 churches are Church of England and    
 Methodist. Any Roman Catholics etc.   
 have to travel.The Salvation Army run 
 Sunday meetings in West Wickham, and  
 Jehovah's Witnesses often call around 
 at people's houses.                   
{GHOSTS}                               
     The Shug Monkey which inhabits the
 countryside between West Wratting amd 
 Balsham has often been written about. 
 It is supposed to be jet black and    
 shaggy with staring eyes in a monkey  
 face. There are bound to be ghosts on 
 the old wartime airfield (Wratting    
 Common) which held 1 American and 3   
 RAF airforce squadrons during the last
 war and was then a base for Displaced 
 Persons (from all over Europe). Most  
 of the evidence has gone except for   
 some farmbuildings and EEC grainstores</content>
