		<content> St. George's Church at Reforne was    
 founded in 1754 and consecrated in    
 1766. Thomas Gilbert built this domed 
 church of local Portland stone using  
 money from the Stone Grant Fund and a 
 contribution of Â£500 from King George 
 III.  Only 30 years after the church  
 was completed a storm in November 1795
 caused such extensive damage that a   
 new roof was needed.  This time George
 III donated Â£200.  The cemetary was   
 often waterlogged, so in 1788 the     
 locals had to dig a ditch round it.   
 The 1851 census shows that, in order  
 to raise funds, 622 of the 642 pews   
 were private property.  Today the     
 church has been carefully restored and
 maintained by local people and,       
 although not used for regular worship,
 it is open to the public and is       
 popular with tourists in the Summer.
