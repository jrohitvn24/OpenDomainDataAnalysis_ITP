		<title>05WISTON MILL,NAYLAND,SUFFOLK</title>
		<content> Wiston Mill comprises an 18th Century 
 Water Mill and Mill House.It was      
 converted into its present form in the
 late 1920's,the present house being   
 formed from three Tudor cottages,and  
 part of the ground and first floor of 
 the Water Mill itself.The Mill House  
 is mainly built of part brick and part
 stud and plaster with a tiled roof,   
 whilst the Mill itself is partly      
 brick,but largely of painted          
 weatherboarding with a slated roof.   
 There is a good deal of the original  
 machinery still in the barn,although  
 the water wheel itself has now almost 
 disappeared.The Mill stands next to   
 the River Stour,the Mill stream       
 running beneath it into the Mill      
 lade,with further sluice gates going  
 off into the Mill Pool.This property  
 is for sale,offers being invited in   
 the region of Â£240,000 freehold.      </content>
