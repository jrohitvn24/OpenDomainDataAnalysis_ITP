		<content> There are two types of Farming,dairy  
 and arable.There are three kinds of   
 crops,barley,oats and wheat.Barley    
 does not grow very well in this area  
 because the land is grade two which is
 not the best.Mr.Dickinson grows barley
 every year.If the barley has a good   
 crop one year then it will be         
 imported. Oats are the best crop that 
 Mr.Dickinson grows.He grows them      
 every year because it is a great      
 success.Oats are imported just like   
 barley.They plant oats and other crops
 with a precision drill.He sells them  
 to Quakers,horse trainers and horse   
 owners.Oats are a useful crop because 
 they put goodness into the soil.He    
 also grows wheat every year in        
 different fields.If he gets a good    
 crop then it will be made into        
 cow food or biscuits.
