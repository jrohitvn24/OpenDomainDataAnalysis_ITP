		<content> The forests are owned by the North    
 Yorks Moors Forest Commission.        
 The soil is peat and research into    
 pollen trapped in peat deposits show  
 the forest was once composed mainly of
 oak, alder, elm, lime, birch, ash and 
 hazel but at the present day the      
 forest consists mainly of pine,       
 spruce, larch and sycamore. The forest
 tree here is Sitka Spruce. It is the  
 forester's 'bread and butter' tree of 
 this area as it grows quickly and     
 gives a high yield of timber.         
 Also where it is very waterlogged,    
 willow trees grow.                    
 The forest provides shelter for wild  
 animals and also many quite rare wild 
 plants and flowers grow.              
 The Forestry Commission is responsible
 for the general upkeep of the forest.
