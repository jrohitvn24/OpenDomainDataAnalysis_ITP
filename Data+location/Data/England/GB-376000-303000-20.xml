		<title>20GENERAL  ROUNDUP</title>
		<content> A number of the subjects we covered   
 have linked together to give a number 
 of worries for the future.            
  The main worry is the falling water  
 table of the River Worfe.This has     
 already caused a loss of fishing      
 especially Trout in the upper reaches 
 of the river and is spreading as the  
 lack of oxygen in the lower water     
 levels causes  a decreasein plant and 
 animal life.The lower levels are also 
 causing problems for farmers who are  
 finding their own private borehols    
 drying upand the land requiring       
 greater irrigation in the Summer.This 
 is leading to small but significant   
 changes in farming patterns as some   
 crops now become unprofitable with the
 increased water costs.There is now    
 also the increased risk of polluted   
 material being drawn into the dry Red 
 Sandstone and polluting all supplies  </content>
