 IN THE{SECOND WORLD WAR}THE RECTORY IN
 SQ.10 WAS CONSIDERABLY DAMAGED. A     
 GERMAN BOMBER ATTEMPTED TO BOMB IT.   
 THE BOMB WAS DROPPED, IT GLANCED OFF A
 GRAVESTONE, AND BLEW A WHOLE WING OFF 
 THE RECTORY. ANOTHER SUPERSTITION IS  
 OF BECKHAM PALACE, THIS ALSO WAS USED 
 IN THE WAR, THIS TIME IT WAS A PRIME  
 PLACE FOR{SUPERNATURAL}HAPPENINGS.    
 ALSO THERE IS A SUPERSTITION THAT IT  
 IS HAUNTED. IF SOMEONE IN A FAMILY    
 DIES, THE OTHERS PAINT THE BEEHIVES   
 BLACK. LASTLY, IF TWO PEOPLE IN A     
 VILLAGE DIES EVERYONE ELSE HAS TO     
 BREAK A MATCHSTICK TO STOP A THIRD ONE
 DYING.
