the Milne Park green, the carnival     
started at Vulcan Way,The route took   
them down King Henrys drive,up Park    
Way,along the Central Parade, up       
Homstead way into the field.The weather
wasn't what it was hoped to be,        
everything went well though, except it 
was too windy for the parachute        
jump.The  carnival floats were very    
colourful but the procession did not   
last as long as last year.There        
were a lot of rides at the fair        
including:The big wheel,Rock a planes, 
chair o planes, The Tahite Express. The

and the scrambler twist. There were    
also many side shows and a good time
