		<content> The area covered by our survey is to  
 the{N}and{NW}of{Tewkesbury.}The area  
 is divided by the{R.Avon}which can    
 only be crossed to the{S}at Tewkesbury
 or 5 kilometeres to the{NW}at         
{Eckington.}To the{E}of the river we   
 have looked at a small corner of the  
 village of{Bredon,}and to the{W}the   
 straggling village of{Twyning,}and the
 settlements at{Shuthonger}and the     
{Mythe.}The entire area forms part of  
 the flood plain of the{Avon,}the Mythe
 being the only point higher than 46   
 meters, and most of the land is under 
 intensive cultivation. Some flooding  
 occurs, mostly on the E bank. Twyning 
 is largely a dormitory village, most  
 people commuting to local towns where 
 skilled work in light industry is     
 available. A small minority are       
 employed in the traditional industry  
 of market gardening.                  </content>
