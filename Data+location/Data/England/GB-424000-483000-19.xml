		<title>19Thorp Perrow, Snape, Yorks.</title>
		<content>   The country mansion of Thorp Perrow,
 now owned by the Ropner family, lies  
 in parkland near the village of Snape.
 The estate belonged at one time to Sir
 Robert Danby, who had a feud with Lord
 Latimer of Snape Castle. This led to  
 violence by both parties and their    
 servants in the sixteenth century.    
   The Milbanke family bought the      
 Castle and Snape village in 1798.     
   The Arboretum was planned by Sir    
 Leonard Ropner over 55 years ago, when
 he was given 65 acres of land by his  
 father. The Arboretum, which is open  
 to the public, had over 2 000         
 different species of trees and shrubs 
 collected during his travels, by the  
 time he died in 1977. Some of the     
 trees are rare and are the largest of 
 their kind in Britain.                
   A memorial to Sir Leonard has been  
 erected in the Arboretum.             </content>
