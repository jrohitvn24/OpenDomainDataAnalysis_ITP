		<title>07 TRADE IN MARTLESHAM VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The Village Shop has been here in     
Blacktiles Lane Martlesham for 25      
years. Mr. Cumberpatch has owned it for
the past 7 years.   He sells mostly    
groceries which he obtains from the    
wholesalers in Suffolk or Essex.       
 All days are busy but the quietest day
is Wednesday.  Most customers are      
local and many also visit the Post     
Office which adjoins the shop.  About  
700 newspapers are sold daily.         
 There are four part-time employees and
one full-time.  Mr.Cumberpatch enjoys  
running the shop because he likes being
his own boss and he enjoys meeting and 
chatting to people.                    
 Owning a shop means long hours at     
work.   Mr.Cumberpatch starts at       
0500 hours and works long after the    
shop closes at 1730 hours.
