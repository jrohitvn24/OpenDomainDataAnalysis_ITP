		<title>03The Devil's Hole        (2)</title>
		<content>   Nicholas Arthur, the man who saved  
 the crew paid a sculptor (John Gifford
 of St.Peter) to add arms, a trident,  
 horns, and a tail to the figurehead,  
 so the devil was created and a new    
 name was given to the{'Creux de Vis':}
 The Devil's Hole.                     
   The devil remained on show for one  
 hundred years until, in July 1951,    
 some jokers came and took the effigy  
 and placed it outside the offices of  
 'The Evening Post' (the local         
 newspaper). In 1957                   
 it was again taken and burned to ashes
 in the name of the Ku-Klux-Klan. A    
 figure in fibre-glass was made and    
 remains to this day.                  
   A visit to the view point above the 
 cave is a favourite tourist           
 attraction.
