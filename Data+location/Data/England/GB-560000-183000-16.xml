		<title>16DANCING</title>
		<content>   Several children in the village     
 learn to dance, usually by attending{ 
{dancing lessons}held in one of the    
 nearby towns and villages.            
  {Ballet}classes are held at a{School 
{of Dancing}in the next village, and   
 some of the Bulphan children attend.  
 One or two children are learning to{  
{tap dance}as well.                    
   Lots of children in school like to  
 take part in the latest{dance crazes} 
 that are popular in{discos}at the     
 moment. There are two types of{disco  
{dance}in fashion just now -{body      
{popping}and{break dancing.}You use the
 whole of your body for these dances.  
   In{body popping}there are many      
 sharp, angular movements whereas in{  
{break dancing}many of the movements   
 are more fluid. One of the difficult  
 moves is when you lie on the floor and
 move along like a{wave}or{caterpillar.</content>
