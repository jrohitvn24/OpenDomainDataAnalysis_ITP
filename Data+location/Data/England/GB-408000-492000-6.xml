		<content>{ST. JOHN'S CHURCH.__}Rebuilt on the   
 original site in 1874 with a kneeler  
 from the previous church inscribed    
 FI1801 in the south wall. The         
 architect and builder was J.Jones of  
 Leyburn.A dignified little church with
 an attractive bell turret, seats and  
 fittings of pitch pine, a font of     
 local stone and an old desk from the  
 school in the vestry. The graveyard,  
 though not ancient, has interesting   
 stones recalling the old village      
 families, the Boer War, former vicars,
 centenarians and local gravestone     
 cutters.                              
{THE MEMORIAL HALL__ }This was built in
 1930 to commemorate those who lost    
 their lives in the war. It is now the 
 centre of community life in the       
 village. The playing field nearby has 
 vestiges of medieval cultivation      
 strips.                               </content>
