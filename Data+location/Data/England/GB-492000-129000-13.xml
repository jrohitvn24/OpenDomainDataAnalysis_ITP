      by Samantha Watson               
  In Northchapel School we start at 4.5
 years old and leave at 10 years old.  
 When you leave our school you go to   
 the Petworth Intermediate School.It is
 called Herbert Shiner School.You leave
 there at 13 years and go to Midhurst  
 Grammar School for another 3 years.You
 can leave at 16 years if you want to. 
  Our subjects at Northchapel are      
 English,Mathematics,P.E.and games.In  
 P.E. we do work on some part of our   
 body on the floor and sometimes on the
 apparatus.In games we play netball,   
 rounders,football,cricket and         
 stoolball and athletics.We also study 
 poetry and during each half-term we   
 have a different topic on             
 environmental work.We have started to 
 do C.D.T. which is Craft,Design and   
 Technology.                           </content>
