		<content> Most of the farmers in our area grow  
 arable crops. The main crops are      
 wheat, potatoes, rape and barley.     
 Hardly any farmers these days have    
 dairy cattle. Before the 2nd World    
 War, all the farmers around here      
 kept milking cows. Lots of farmers    
 though keep beef cattle. Usually they 
 buy young cattle in February. They    
 keep these animals in sheds until     
 about April, when the weather gets    
 better and the grass starts to grow.  
 The cattle stay in the fields until   
 October. By this time there is not    
 much grass and the weather is starting
 to get cold, so they are brought back 
 into sheds and fed on silage, which is
 hay that the farmer has cut in the    
 summer and which is now beginning to  
 rot. By next May the cattle have grown
 to about 10cwt., which is just about  
 right to be made into meat.           </content>
