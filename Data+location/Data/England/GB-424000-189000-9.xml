		<content>nations from the free world mainly     
Australians.Most of the nationalities  
take Army degree courses.There are     
three types divided into thirds one    
third are degree courses in            
engineering   and such things.Another  
third is Army staff courses each of    
these are about 12 months long but in  
the final third they are only 1-6      
weeks long specialist courses.The      
Commandant in residence at the moment  
has had something to do with the army  
since 1955 but has only been           
Commandant since 1983.There have been  
14 other Commandants since 1946.       
The normal age of someone joining the  
forces is 18,but this is not strictly  
true for when you reach the age of 17  
and a half you are paid the wages of a 
man and can be sent to war,but you may 
actually join when you are 15.5 years  
old.                                   </content>
