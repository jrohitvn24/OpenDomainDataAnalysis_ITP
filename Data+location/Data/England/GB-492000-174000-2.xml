		<content>    My name is Ann Gowman and{I am 15. 
{My family live in Windsor}and I attend
 a Comprehensive School.               
    Dad is 45 and works in Slough. Mum 
 is 42 and is a{night nurse.}My sister 
 is 19 and works as a typist.          
    On a typical day I rise at 7.00a.m.
 and have toast and coffee. We all     
 leave the house by 8.00a.m. after     
 watching breakfast television.        
    Mum returns from work at 8.30a.m.  
 and by 10.30a.m. is in bed. I return  
 home at 3.30p.m., watch T.V. and begin
 my{homework.}By 5.30p.m. we have      
 dinner and watch Crossroads. I go to  
{ballroom dancing class}when Mum leaves
 for her night shift at 7.30p.m. My    
 sister does the ironing whilst Dad    
 works on the car.                     
    I return home at 11.45p.m. after a 
 long day.                             
                                       </content>
