 estates and public amenities.

 small,tidy,terraced houses.There is a 
 park &amp; baths. We also have a large    
 shopping centre.This is a massive     
 structure with lots of shops inside.  
  The{CRAIGHURST ESTATE}has quite old  
 houses.The shops nearby have graffiti 
 scrawled on their walls.There is a    
 lot of litter and most of the shops   
 are boarded up. {                     
  In the{GATEACRE ESTATE}people live in
 very large,expensive,detached houses. 
 Most of the people who live here enjoy
 a good standard of living.            
  {CHILDWALL}is an area of mostly      
 privately owned semi-detached houses. 
  In the area there are several parks  
 such as Reynolds &amp; Calderstones,the
