		<title>06Transport around Alton.</title>
		<content>    In Alton and Holybourne, until they
 built a{by-pass}in 1971, there used to
 be lots of traffic on the roads and it
 took about half an hour to get through
 Alton and Holybourne.  Today there is 
 much less traffic.                    
                                       
    Alton's{railway station}serves as  
 an interchange between British Rail to
 London, and the private 'Watercress'  
 steam line to Alresford. {The}        
{Watercress Line}opened as a private   
 railway line in 1977, following       
 British Railway's closure of the line 
 in 1973, but the final link from      
 Medstead to Alton was not re-opened   
 until 1985.
