		<content>             { Kitchens                
  Every body had 1 kitchen which we    
 expected. There wouldn't be 2 kitchens
 because you only need 1 in which to   
 cook meals.                           
              {Dining Rooms            
  5 people haven't got any dining rooms
 at all but there are 15 people with   
 dining rooms. So most people have a   
 dining room.                          
              {Lounges                 
  We expected that each house would    
 only have 1 lounge, but we had 1 house
 with 2. So that means that most houses
 only have 1 lounge.                   
              {Bedrooms                
  There are 2 people who have got 4    
 bedrooms, 12 people have 3, and 6     
 people have 2. Therefore most people  
 have 3 bedrooms in their houses.
