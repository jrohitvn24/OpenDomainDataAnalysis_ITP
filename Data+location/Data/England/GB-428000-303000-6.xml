		<content> station with a field of potatoes.The {
{landscape}on the other side was a mess
 with tall grass full of nettles and   
 wild flowers.When we came back up the 
 lane we noticed a river of water      
 coming down the lane.It was the man   
 from the Severn Trent Water Board.He  
 was testing the stand pipe.We noticed 
 that there was a tiny{school}in the   
 garden of a bungalow.On the front of  
 the building it said Traditional      
 School,erected in 1839.We went back to
 collect our questionaires on Wednesday
 .There were two Shetland ponies tied  
 up on the{village}green by the{church}
 and we stroked them.We went to the    
 boarding kennels and cattery and the  
 lady invited us in.She had to shut her
 three dogs in a shed.Inside the house 
 were some lovely kittens which the    
 lady had saved from a rubbish tip.We  
 enjoyed it.                           </content>
