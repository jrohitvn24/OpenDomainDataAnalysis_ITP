		<title>14W.Loughborough Brownie packs</title>
		<content> There are{3}Brownie packs in this     
 area, one at my school{Boothwood,}one 
 at{Burleigh College}and one at{Thorpe 
{Acre Church.}                         
 Brownies are{girls}between the ages of
{7}and{10}who meet together once a     
 week.A meeting usually consists of    
 games, badge work and singing.The     
 Brownie motto is{LEND A HAND.}        
 My mum is a Brownie leader of the     
 Burleigh College pack.The Brownies    
 call her{Brown Owl.}The other leader  
 is called{Tawny Owl.}My mum has got 24
 Brownies in her pack.They are divided 
 into 4 groups named Sixes.Each Six has
 a title such as{Pixies,Elves,Gnomes}or
{Imps.}Each six has a leader named a   
{Sixer.}She looks after the Brownies in
 her Six.I was a Brownie for 3 years   
 but now I have moved up to{Guides     
 because I am{11}years old.
