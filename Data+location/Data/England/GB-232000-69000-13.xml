		<content>    Here are some{clubs}that some      
 children go to in Callington.         
    I go to{Brownies}every Thursday. It
 is interesting, you play games and    
 sing songs. I would like to be a Guide
 and go to camp.                       
    I go to{Prim-Raf Drama group.}Every
 season we do a pantomime where        
 everybody has a part in dancing or    
 acting. There is a party afterwards.  
                                       
  I go to {Majorettes. }I go on Tuesday
 nights from 6.30 to 8.30. I pay 40p   
 for subs. I practice with a baton and 
 the band practice their music.        
  I go to{Pottery Club. }I go          
 on wednesdays from 3.40 to 5.00. When 
 I first went I started making hand    
 pots. Then I painted patterns on them.
 I enjoy it very much every Wednesday.
