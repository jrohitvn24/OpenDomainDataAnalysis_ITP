		<content> There are a few customs in the grid   
 squares we were given. In Aust there  
 is a fete and a whist drive once a    
 year, which is when people gather to  
 play card games.                      
 Also there is a time when the "Young  
 Farmers Club" bless the plough so that
 it will churn good soil and make the  
 crops plentiful. This meeting takes   
 place annually.                       
 Around Mill Farm there is an open-air 
 fair for the harvest, once a year in  
 the Summer. Also in the local church  
 of St Thomas there is a service where 
 gifts are offered.                    
 Also in our area there are  some      
 barn-dances.  This occasion is very   
 traditional and goes back along way   
 through the centuries.  It takes place
 in a barn, and is held once every     
 three weeks.  The barn-dance is       
 enjoyed by the local people.          </content>
