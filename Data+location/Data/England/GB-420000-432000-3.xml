		<content>    Older houses in the area are stone-
 built,having been erected when Pudsey 
 played an important part in the       
 woollen industry.Many houses,terraced,
 semi-detached and detached,have been  
 stone-cleaned.Others have been left,  
 their owners feeling that cleaning    
 them would rob them of character and  
 part of their history.                
    Newer housing is both council and  
 privately owned.Most of the council   
 houses are semi-detached with private 
 gardens.There are a few blocks of     
 flats and maisonettes.The private     
 houses built most recently tend to be 
 in small developments.Most can be     
 found in the north-west of the block. 
 One of the most interesting building  
 trends is the renewal of old areas.   
{Booth's Yard,}built in the 1700's,has 
 been given a new lease of life as a   
 tourist attraction in the town-centre.</content>
