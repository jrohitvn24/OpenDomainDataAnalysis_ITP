		<title>13VILLAGE SHOPS, CALDER VALE</title>
		<content>  There are not many shops in this     
 block and most people go to Garstang  
 (5 miles), Preston (12 miles), or     
 Lancaster (12 miles).                 
                                       
 In Calder Vale there are two shops.   
                                       
{Post Office:}This sells sweets, cards,
 newspapers, and ice-cream. It is right
 in the middle of the Village near the 
 bridge.                               
                                       
{Village Store:}The Village Store sells
 fresh meat, fresh fruit, frozen foods,
 and groceries. There are two people   
 who work in the Village Store.        
 It was once called the co-op, and was 
 nearly closed down but somebody bought
 it and people like going there.       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
