    William of Cliffe and Preston owned
 the land where Preston Hall was built 
 from 1600 to 1722. In 1820 David      
 Burton Fowler bought the land and     
 built the house. The conservatory and 
 stone porch were added by Sir William 
 Ropner. The hall is now used as a     
 museum and is owned by Stockton       
 Borough Council. The land around it is
 used as a park. Walker Street, which  
 is just behind the hall, is a replica 
 of a Victorian street. In the street  
 there are some working craftsmen.There
 is a farrier, a blacksmith and some   
 workers in wood. There are lots of    
 industrial machines. In the hall there
 are some period rooms showing life in 
 the nineteenth century. Upstairs there
 is a collection of children's toys.   
  'The Dice Players' by De La Tour is a
 famous painting belonging to the hall.</content>
