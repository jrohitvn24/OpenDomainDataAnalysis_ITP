 This W.I. has a membership of         
 twenty-seven, most of whom are over   
 seventy.   This year they have been on
 an outing to a craft fair and flower  
 festival, which was not enjoyed by    
 most members because of too many      
 stairs.                               
 They held the Institute's Fortieth    
 Birthday Party, and a coffee morning  
 and a Jumble Sale to raise funds.     
 They have also held a flower show and 
 ploughman's lunches.   They have shown
 the film, 'Green and Pleasant Land' to
 members.   The title comes from a line
 of the song 'Jerusalem' which the     
 Women's Institute Movement has adopted
 as its Anthem.
