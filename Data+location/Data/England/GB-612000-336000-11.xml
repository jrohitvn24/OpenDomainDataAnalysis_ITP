 NORMAN SANDERS OF SANDER'S COACHES    
 PROVIDES MOST OF THE PUBLIC TRANSPORT 
 USING HIS 20 STRONG COACH FLEET. HIS  
 DEPOT IS IN HOLT. HE HAS AN EXTENSIVE 
 TIMETABLE CATERING FOR REMOTE         
 VILLAGES. ON TUESDAY HE GOES TO HOLT, 
 ON WEDNESDAY TO NORWICH AND ON        
 THURSDAY TO SHERINGHAM. A LARGE       
 MAJORITY NOW HAVE CARS BUT MOST OF    
 THEM ARE YOUNGISH PEOPLE. A FEW OF THE
 ELDERLY WHO HAVE MOVED TO NORFOLK FROM
 ELSEWHERE IN RETIREMENT ALSO HAVE CARS
 BUT MOST OF  THE NORFOLK VETERANS LIKE
 FARMERS AND FARM  LABOURERS RELY ON   
 THE BICYCLE FOR TRANSPORTATION.
