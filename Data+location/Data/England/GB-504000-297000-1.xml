		<title>01THE WANSFORD AREA</title>
		<content>                                       
  The Wansford area is dominated       
 by farmland, open pasture land and the
 two villages of Wansford and          
 Yarwell. Wansford is the largest      
 village out of the two, and extends   
 along the River Nene.                 
  To the west of Wansford there is     
 Cocker Wood, surrounded by fields.    
 Several of these are bordered by      
 quarries, some which are old and no   
 longer mined. South-west of Wansford  
 there is Old Sulehay Forest and the   
 adjoining Cows Wood. Further south is 
 more woodland, known as John's Wood   
 and Ring Haw. An opencast mining area 
 lies far south of John's Wood, and    
 bordering these woods is the straight 
 Roman Road. There are more Roman      
 remains, of a building, north of the  
 road on the other side of Cocker Wood.
