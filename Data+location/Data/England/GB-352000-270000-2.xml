		<content> Children at Ashford Carbonell school  
 play various games,some old,some      
 new.Children usually play in groups   
 and sometimes the whole school is     
 involved in playing a particular      
 game.Games can be grouped into ball   
 games,chasing games,skipping games and
 pretending games.'British Bulldogs' is
 a favourite game.This is how you play 
 it:There is a person in the middle and
 when he calls your name you have to   
 get past him without getting caught   
 but if he says British Bulldog you all
 have to get past.If he tigs you,you   
 have to help him to catch the others. 
 If you have another game,the first    
 person caught is 'on.In Autumn,conkers
 are popular with the boys.In cold     
 weather, skidding and snowball fights 
 are favourites.At Ashford School we   
 have a climbing frame and a slide     
 which we like playing on at any time. </content>
