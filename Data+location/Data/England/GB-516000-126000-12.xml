		<content> The{Brownies}started over fifty years 
 ago. Our pack meets at the{school}from
 5.00-6.30pm on{Thursdays.}There are 24
 Brownies, 6 in each pack. The packs   
 are called: Pixies, Gnomes,           
 Leprechauns and Imps. Our guider is   
 called Mrs Hempstead, we call her{Blue
{Flash.}Mrs Hazel is{Barn Owl}and there
 are two pack leaders called Charlotte 
 and Jocelyn. After three years you    
 leave the Brownies and go up to the   
 Guides. The adventures we go on are   
 the{Brownie camp}and the{Brownie      
{revels.}The Brownie revels were held  
 last year at Billingshurst on a farm -
 it was fun. The camp last year        
 was held at Blackland Farm, Lancing.  
 We collect milk bottle tops and foil  
 to help pay for a{guide dog}for the   
 blind.
