		<title>16PYECOMBE GOLF COURSE</title>
		<content> Pyecombe Golf Course covers the       
 central part of our block on top of   
 the Downs. The professional has been  
 there for 18 years. He told us that   
 the Club started in 1894 with a       
 separate ladies course. Today members'
 ages range from 9 to 7O. They come    
 from all different social backgrounds.
 Thirty years ago artisans made up much
 of the membership. Fifteen years ago  
 it cost Â£35 to join, today Â£36O for   
 adults but only Â£3O for children. This
 is half the price compared to London  
 courses. Pyecombe Course has only 3   
 groundstaff who use machinery         
 including tractors and mowers. The    
 professional believes that bigger     
 greens and more hazards like bunkers  
 would make the course even more       
 enjoyable. It is a small, friendly    
 club on a pretty course which is      
 attractive to members in all seasons. </content>
