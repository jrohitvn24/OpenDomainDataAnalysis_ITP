		<title>02Interview with Mrs. Lawson</title>
		<content>  Mrs Lawson was born on the Eyhurst   
 estate and has lived in this area for 
 70 years. Eyhurst estate in Chipstead 
 had 1 doctor,a post office and a sweet
 shop. A horse and cart came around    
 with provisions. The roads were only  
 made of gravel and were very rough.   
 People had to walk wherever they      
 wanted to go. The only good road was  
 from Chipstead Station to Reigate     
 Hill. Mrs Lawson attended a school    
 with only one classroom and children  
 from 5 to 14 had lessons together. The
 railway from Tattenham corner to      
 Chipstead was built during her        
 childhood. The railway banks were     
 clear then but are now overgrown. The 
 people were very poor and at Christmas
 the church gave red cloaks to the poor
 to keep them warm. Most children      
 attended Sunday school. Life was very 
 simple before the second world war.   </content>
