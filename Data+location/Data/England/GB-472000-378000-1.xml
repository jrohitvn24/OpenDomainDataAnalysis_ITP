		<title>01THE PARISH OF GROVE</title>
		<content> The village of Grove is built on a    
 hill at the centre of this area.On a  
 clear day the views are outstanding   
 with Lincoln cathedral and Belvoir    
 castle appearing in the distance.The  
 village has no shops,public houses, or
 surgeries. The Garden Centre includes 
 a small cafe and newspapers are       
 delivered via a private house.The     
 centre of the village buildings is the
 Church.It is dedicated to Saint Helen,
 but with no clergy residing in the    
 village,it has very limited Services. 
 The churchyard is still in use.The    
 area is almost entirely agricultural  
 and was formerly part of the Grove    
 Estate.The area is not served by main 
 or secondary roads,has no public      
 service transport and no village      
 school. The village hall has fallen   
 into a state of neglect.
