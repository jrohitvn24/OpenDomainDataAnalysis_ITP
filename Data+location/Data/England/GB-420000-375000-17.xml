		<title>17ATTITUDES OF THREE LADIES.</title>
		<content> We olso asked these questions to the  
 lady who moved to Eyam in 1984.       
{1. why did you move to Eyam?          
{2. What attracted you about the area?}

 the lady that has lived in Eyam all   
 her life.                             
{1. It would be an advantage to have a 
{drama group or a quoir and more

{lot of changers but i still love it,  
{though there,s a few too many         
{visiters.                             
{3. Yes because i,m a real villager.   
{The only thing that dos,nt intrest me 
{is politics. I,m intrested in         
{everything that goes on in the village
{from bingo to football.               
{4. No definitely i would not wish to  
{live elsewhere.
