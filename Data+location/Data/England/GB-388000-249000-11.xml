		<title>11The Old Vicarage, Stoulton</title>
		<content>   The Old Vicarage in Stoulton was    
 built in Tudor times and was extended 
 in 1820.  An impressive archway spans 
 the large house and garage  which was 
 once the stables and coach house.  The
 house was where the vicar of the      
 Norman Church opposite lived many     
 years ago.                            
   Now the renovated church is served  
 by one vicar who cares for two other  
 local parishes, Pirton and Drakes     
 Broughton where he is based.          
   To the left of the large, colourful 
 grounds are acres of corn and wheat   
 fields. Previously they had been fruit
 orchards which were cleared seventeen 
 years ago. In one of these fields lies
 the decaying ruins of an old mortuary.
 An interesting village where, sadly,  
 employment and amenities have declined
 because most villagers have cars and  
 commute to Worcester.                 </content>
