		<title>13The Chinese Garage,Beckenham</title>
		<content>{Kelsey Park}is the site of a          
 recreation area,and a school of the   
 same name.                            
 There is also one parade of shops in  
 Wickham Road which deal with the needs
 of local people.The busiest shops are 
 the newsagents/Post Office and a small
 Supermarket.                          
 Next to the entrance to the park is   
 the Chinese Roundabout,so called      
 because of the pagoda design of the   
 garage on the roundabout.This building
 is quite famous and is listed in a    
 book on architecture.The roundabout is
 always very busy because it           
 carries traffic between Bromley and   
 Croydon.
