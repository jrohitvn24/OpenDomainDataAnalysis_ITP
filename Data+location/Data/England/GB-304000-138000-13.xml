		<title>13Gliddons of Williton</title>
		<content>     Gliddons was a{blacksmith}before  
 it became a{Garage.  }J.Gliddon and   
 his son bought the premises in        
 Williton.   They took on{four smiths }
 to deal with the trade.   At the      
 beginning of the century the          
 Blacksmiths in the High Street had to 
 make a bit more room for the{motor    
{car.  }At first Benjamin Gliddon had  
 conducted the motor business over at  
 Bank Street near the School and the   
 company sold Rustun and Hornsby Cars. 
 These were such{difficult vehicles to}
 drive that one customer, Mr George    
 Risdon, of Washford would travel all  
 the way down to the station yard in   
 order to avoid putting the machine in 
{reverse gear.}  There was a dozen cars
 in the whole of Somerset.   J.Gliddon 
 and Sons jumped on the bandwagon by   
 selling their{touring models at Â£125  
 in 1916 but at Â£230 four years later. </content>
