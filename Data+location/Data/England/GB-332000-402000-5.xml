		<content>   Carr Side farm includes the fields  
 and some woodland inside the park wall
 and extends from there to the south   
 bank of the River Alt.                
   The cereal crops on the farm, at the
 time of survey, June-July, were wheat 
 and barley.The root crops were        
 patatoes and sugar,beet.One field was 
 in grass and ready for cutting. This  
 would would be baled and kept for     
 winter feed.                          
   There are 200 cattle kept for       
 beef,mainly Charolais and crosses.    
 most of the cattle are bought at 12-14
 weeks and fed on barley until about 10
 months when they are sent to market.  
 The bullocks weigh about 500kg at     
 11-12 months.35 cows are kept for     
 breeding.                             
  Most of the barley is grown for      
 animal feed. The sugar beet is sold   
 for refining.                         </content>
