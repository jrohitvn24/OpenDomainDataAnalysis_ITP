		<title>03HOW MALT IS MADE</title>
		<content> They take the barley which is grown by
 the farmers and they turn it into malt
 by soaking it for 56 hours, then grow 
 it for 4 days, then put it in bags for
 a day and finally cook it. When we    
 went to have a look round, we put our 
 hands in a sack of malt and it was    
 burning hot and sticky. We tasted it  
 too and it wasn't very nice. Malt has 
 more to do with alcohol. They don't   
 have anything to do with hops which   
 gives the bitter taste to beer.       
 Here in Thorpe_le_Soken they make     
 crystal malt. This is a very special  
 sort of malt and there are only six   
 maltings like this in the whole of    
 England. Its a very rare product.     
 1500 tons of crystal malt is made here
 every year.
