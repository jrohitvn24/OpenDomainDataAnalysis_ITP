		<content> Doctors from the Youlgrave practice   
 and the District Nurse will call as   
 necessary. Major surgery and          
 specialist care are undertaken at     
 Chesterfield Royal Hospital, Calow.   
 Post operative and minor cases are    
 treated at Bakewell Cottage Hospital  
 and the Whitworth at Darley Dale.     
 Considerable difficulties are         
 experienced for non car owners in     
 attending these hospitals due to lack 
 of transport. Emergency transport is  
 by ambulance, but a hospital visit can
 take all day if using public          
 transport.                            
 The hospital at Parwich provides short
 term care for infirm elderly people.  
 Dental treatment can be obtained in   
 Bakewell.                             
 District Nurses, Health Visitors and  
 Home Helps provide domestic services  
 when required.                        </content>
