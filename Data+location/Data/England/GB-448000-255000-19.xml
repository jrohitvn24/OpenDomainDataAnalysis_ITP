		<title>19Local History Priors Marston</title>
		<content>     MARSTON means "settlement near a  
 marsh" from the Anglo Saxon "merise"  
 (marsh) and "ton" (settlement). PRIORS
 was added by Coventry Priory (given   
 the parish by Earl Leofric in 1043),  
 to endorse their claim to ownership &amp; 
 avoid confusion with other Marstons.  
    At the time of the Domesday Survey 
 in 1086 a settlement is recorded.     
    The village is on the Old Salt Road
 (recorded by charter in 998) between  
 Droitwich &amp; the Midland markets, salt 
 being used to preserve meat &amp; hides.  
    The ancient Ridgeway, linking a    
 chain of British Camps that once      
 stretched across the land, runs along 
 the ridge between the Thames &amp; Severn 
 catchments.                           
    Drovers used the Welsh Road for    
 centuries to drive cattle &amp; sheep from
 Wales to the London markets.
