{his visit to the Police Station. }    
  I started noticing things as soon as 
 we arrived. First the{Coat of Arms    
 above the door, it consisted of three 
 symbols, a{lion}representing          
{Herefordshire, three pears}for        
{Worcestershire}and a{leopard's head   
 for{Shropshire.                       
  We were shown around by{Inspector    
{Burrett.}He showed us a{truncheon     
 and a pair of{hand-cuffs,}then took us
 into the yard to see the cars.There   
 was a{Patrol}car, a{Panda}car and a   
{Personnel Carrier}as well as the      
{motorbikes.                           
  In the{Operations Room}there was the 
{computer}and the{teleprinter}as well  
 as a{close-circuit T.V.}screen. There 
 were{cameras}on both the front and    
 back doors. Finally we were shown the 
{cells}and the{detention rooms.        </content>
