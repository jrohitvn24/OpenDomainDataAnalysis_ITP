		<title>04Staploe, Bushmead Priory</title>
		<content> The Bushmead Estate is a wooded and   
 farmed area of great beauty, owned by 
 the Wade-Gery family since 1552. Their
 Georgian mansion was demolished in    
 1965 but there are still many         
 attractive buildings, the jewel being 
 the Refectory of an Augustian Priory, 
 founded about 1195. After many        
 alterations, following its            
 dissolution, first as a house, then as
 stabling, while the rest was          
 progressively dismantled, the         
 Refectory in 1973, was placed in the  
 care of English Heritage who have     
 recently repaired and opened it to the
 public. The buildings chief glory is  
 the magnificent timber roof, a rare   
 and beautiful example of crown-post   
 construction, dated around 1250. There
 are also, mediaeval wall-paintings and
 stained glass. The original fishponds 
 are situated, nearby, in the valley.  </content>
