		<title>15SOCIAL AMENITIES</title>
		<content>Many of the social functions held in   
Merton tend to centre around the       
Village Hall.Built in the early 1970's 
on the site of the Recreation Ground it
is managed by a Hall Committee and a   
Management Body of Trustees.Changing   
Rooms for the local Football Team are  
attached to it.The Hall has never      
really become a focal point of village 
life but it belongs to the whole       
village where such events as the Fete  
can be held,the celebration of         
important events can be organised and  
it is also a safe place for the        
children to play.The Playground that   
adjoins it contains swings and slides. 
The Hall was extended in 1984 and it   
provides a meeting place for bingo,    
church and mothers and toddlers groups.
It is hired for jumble sales,coffee    
mornings and dances.Allotments nearby  
provide additional garden space.       </content>
