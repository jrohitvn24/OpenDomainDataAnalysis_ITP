		<title>02CLENT HILLS</title>
		<content> The Clent Hills are used for a        
{country park.}The land around it is   
 used for farming and grazing. There is
 a field where people practise horse   
 jumping. There are a lot of country   
 walks about. There is a wood in the   
 surroundings of {Hagley Hall.}We saw a
 game warden. He is someone who looks  
 after the grounds. There are a lot of 
 clay pigeons about. (These are things 
 that people shoot instead of real     
 pigeons.) We saw a couple of deers in 
 the wood.                             
                                       
 The entrances to the wood were        
 padlocked and have barbed wire on     
 them. You have to get permission to   
 enter.
