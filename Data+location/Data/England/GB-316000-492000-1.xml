		<title>01Introduction to our area</title>
		<content> Our area is a very beautiful and      
 remote part of South West Cumbria.It  
 is a rural community depending mainly 
 on sheep farming and forestry,        
 implemented by tourism.Many of the    
 houses are used for holiday purposes  
 only. Every year there are an         
 increasing number of visitors to rock 
 climb or fell walk or day trippers and
 naturalists attracted by the scenic   
 beauty of the wild rugged fells and   
 the unpolluted river flowing through  
 high crags and gorges with deep       
 swimming pools.It is of great         
 importance to preserve and protect    
 the natural beauty and to appreciate  
 the heritage.
