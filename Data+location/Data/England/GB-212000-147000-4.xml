		<title>04The Lundy Field Society.</title>
		<content> The Lundy Field Society was founded   
 in 1947 by Mr.M.C.Harman and over the 
 years it has done a great deal towards
 conservation on Lundy.Until 1968 the  
 Old Light was used as the             
 headquarters.Nowadays members usually 
 meet in the Tavern where they can     
 exchange information and record       
 sightings and other observations in   
 the record books.The Society publishes
 an annual report and has conducted a  
 number of surveys.It concerns itself  
 not only with the flora and fauna but 
 also with archaeology and other       
 aspects of the Lundy environment.     
 The Field Society have constructed    
 bird traps for the capture and ringing
 of migratory birds.The use of these   
 traps used to be open to all members  
 but now the ringers for each week are 
 specified on a rota for the season.
