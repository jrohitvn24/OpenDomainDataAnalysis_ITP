		<content>  There are many various types and     
 styles of housing to be found in our  
 block.  The old village part of North 
 Hykeham has many old houses that are  
 built of stone. Many older properties 
 that have become derelict are now     
 being modernised as Hykeham is a      
 popular residential area, especially  
 the old village part.                 
  Tere are a number of detached and    
 semi-detached houses built in brick   
 that date from the 1900's. Most of    
 these have large gardens as it was    
 common then that people woulg grow a  
 lot of their own food.  Most of the   
 modern houses (1970- ) have small     
 gardens.  Most modern property built  
 has been of the bungalow type built by
 D.W.Bocock, although his plans for a  
 new estate at the bottom of Water Lane
 includes many houses of an            
 'Elizabethan' and 'Tudor' style.      </content>
