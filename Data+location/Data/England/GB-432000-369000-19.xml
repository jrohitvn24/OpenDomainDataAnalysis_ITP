		<title>19CHANDER HILL HOUSE</title>
		<content>         Chander Hill is a typical     
 Derbyshire country residence. It is   
 based on an 18th Century farm house.  
 The house is built in random stone    
 with stone framed and mullioned       
 windows, stone slate roof and coped   
 gables. The house was modernized in   
 1931. There has been a farm on this   
 site since 1208 when Serlo the Saxon  
 Lord of Beeley Manor gave 60 acres to 
 the monks of Beauchief Abbey. A       
 chantry was built in approximately    
 1400, one stone of which can still be 
 seen today. About 1536 Chander Hill   
 was transferred to the Guild of the   
 Holy Cross, Chesterfield, possibly to 
 avoid confiscation by Henry VIII. The 
 date of the original parts of the     
 current house is 1731.                
    Chander Hill is one of several old 
 buildings in the area. Others include 
 Hipper Hall and Somersall Hall.       </content>
