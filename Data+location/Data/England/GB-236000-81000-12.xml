		<title>12Bradstone Manor Farm Wood</title>
		<content> This uningabited area is approached by
 a narrow road between Bradstone and   
 Bawcombe Farms. The hill top falls    
 away to the east and north and is     
 bounded by a stream, the Winnie       
 flowing into the Tamar. The land is   
 used primarily for sheep with one     
 arable field on the hill top. Bordered
 by farm track and strip of grassland  
 lies an area of deciduous woodlan     
 clinging to the steep hillside. Oak,  
 ash, beech, sycamore, hornbeam, silver
 birch, with blackthorn and hawthorn   
 bordering the stream. Difficulty of   
 access makes this a natural habitat   
 for wildlife including; deer fox,     
 badger, and valley birds. In the      
 wood's northern corner is evidence of 
 a disused quarry where openings to    
 extensive badger setts can be seen.
