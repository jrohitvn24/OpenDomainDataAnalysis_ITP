		<title>15Dane Royd First School</title>
		<content>  Dane Royd opened in September 1984   
 but was officially opened on 5th      
 september 1984 by Mrs J.Beech, Mayor  
 of Wakefield. All the children who go 
 to Dane Royd are aged between 3 and 9.
 Mr. Broadhead has been Headmaster for 
 four years. In the school they have   
 twice as many boys than girls. Dane   
 Royd has six full time teachers with  
 six classes and the Headmaster. There 
 are 131 children in the main part of  
 the school and 40 children in the     
 nursery. Dane royd was first planned  
 in 1967 but it wasn't untill 1984 that
 the plans were carried out. Dane Royd 
 First School was built to replace     
 Painthorpe First School which has now 
 been demolished. So now all the pupils
 and staff of Painthorpe School have   
 been transfered to Dane Royd.
