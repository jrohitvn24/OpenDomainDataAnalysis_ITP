		<title>05Asfordby by E.Cracknell</title>
		<content> Asfordby is a large village,almost a  
 small town.I would not like it any    
 bigger or else it might spoil it.It   
 has nice village shops and a          
 newsagents/post office.               
 Asfordby has a main road which almosts
 cuts the village in half.There is a   
 small playing field near Wreake       
 Crescent.On the playing field there   
 are two climbing frames and some      
 concrete tubes.                       
 I think Asfordby could be made better 
 with a sports complex and with lots of
 games courts.                         
 The people of Asfordby are kind.
