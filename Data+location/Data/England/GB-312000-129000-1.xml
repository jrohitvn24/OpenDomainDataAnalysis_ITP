 This block lies just to the west of   
 Bishops Lydeard in Somerset. It is    
 within sight of the Quantock Hills to 
 the east and is about 8 miles from the
 sea.                                  
                                       
 It is a pleasant, rural area inhabited
 by farmers, tradespeople and          
 commuters. There are few amenities in 
 the block apart from Lynchfield       
 Hospital which lies in the south-east 
 corner of the block. Part of the West 
 Somerset Railway ( privately owned    
 runs across the north-east cornwr of  
 the block.
