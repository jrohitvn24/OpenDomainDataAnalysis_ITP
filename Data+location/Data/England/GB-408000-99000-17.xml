		<content> I'm Susan. I have two Jack Russell    
{dogs,}Jess and Ben. I like taking them
 for walks. I have two{fish,}Goldie and
 Fred, which are kept in a fish tank in
 the kitchen. I have three{cats,}Pip,  
 Fluff and Whiskey, who sleep outside  
 in a basket each but protected from   
 the rain.                             
 I'm Laura.  I have two adopted{cats,  
 Lucky and Tinkerbell.I feed them night
 and morning, with milk and liver.     
 I'm Sarah. My cat's name is Tabbitha. 
 She is a one year old tabby with white
 paws. Tabbi is affectionate with a    
 comical character.                    
 I'm Kathryn. My{dog}is Sam, a four    
 year old labrador with two specific   
 markings, a white star on her chest,  
 and a split left ear. We got her from 
 the RSPCA. She had been ill-treated.  
 The split ear resulted from a scissor 
 cut.                                  </content>
