 This is one of the oldest industrial  
 sites in the Warrington area.The land 
 is located on the banks of the River  
 Mersey,and was spelt on early         
 maps"Bankey",which progressed to Bank 
 Quay with the building of the quay    
 beside the Mersey.                    
 From the late seventeenth century     
 boats could transport goods in larger 
 quantities and in less time than the  
 cart and pack horse.                  
 Early industries on the river's banks 
 included a copper works,a glass       
 works,and a chemical works.           
 Today the area is dominated by the    
 Crosfields chemical works which is    
 part of the Lever Brothers group.
