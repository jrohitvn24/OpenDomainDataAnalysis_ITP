		<title>01THE BARFORD-BURCOMBE AREA</title>
		<content>  Barford and Burcombe villages are    
 surrounded by open countryside which  
 towards the river supports livestock, 
 mainly sheep, as the ground will not  
 support arable. Elsewhere arable      
 farming, mainly cereals, is practised.
  The London-Exeter railway line runs  
 mainly parallel with the main A30 road
 and the river Nadder. Main roads in   
 the area are very busy with local and 
 business, plus summer holiday traffic.
  Both villages are largely dormitory, 
 the larger houses owned by business   
 people who commute to Salisbury or    
 elsewhere. There are small council    
 estates which house mainly manual     
 workers. The area is generally one of 
 affluence and has been unaffected by  
 the recent rcession.It is popular     
 because it affords a country style of 
 living but is close to places of work 
 and entertainment in nearby towns.    </content>
