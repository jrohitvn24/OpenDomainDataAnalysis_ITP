		<content>  In our Domesday Block we have 4 main 
areas of habitation:-Sutton-at-Hone,   
Swanley Village and parts of Hextable  
and Swanley.                           
  We wanted to find out how settled the
population was and our survey          
discovered that the numbers of people  
who had always lived in the area,was   
slightly less than those who have moved
into the area.                         
  We found that most people who have   
moved into our area originally came    
from London,or other parts of Kent.Only
a few had come from other parts of     
England,or other countries.            
  We asked people what jobs they did,  
and found a wide range of different    
occupations.Quite a number of people   
seemed to have manual or clerical jobs.
About 15% of those questioned had      
professional jobs and there were quite 
a lot of housewives.                   </content>
