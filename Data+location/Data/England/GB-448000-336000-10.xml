		<title>10A DAY IN THE LIFE OF LOUISA</title>
		<content>   I am 11 years old and each Saturday 
 morning at 8.o'clock, I get up, have  
 my breakfast, wash and put on my      
 riding clothes. Then my family and I  
 jump in the car, drive off to Elvaston
 Riding Centre and I have my 10.0'clock
 ride. When my lesson is over we call  
 in at Auntie Sheila's. Last Saturday  
 we stayed for dinner and tea. Then we 
 went home. I really like riding and   
 horses, that's why I am telling you   
 about it. When we arrive home I change
 my clothes. Then it's back in the car 
 and off to Gran's, who lives 5 minutes
 away from us. When we arrive at Gran's
 I go and call for Julie, who stay's at
 her Gran's for the weekend. We play   
 until 8.o'clock. Then she goes in.    
 Next my Gran and I have chips from the
 chippy van. Afterwards we get into    
 bed.
