		<title>02PRINCE'S GOLF COURSE</title>
		<content>{Prince's Golf Club}at Sandwich is     
 situated inside the wide sweep of     
{Sandwich Bay.} The grass is fine in   
 texture, and the fairways maintain    
 their springiness throughout the year.
 It has 27 holes of championship       
 standard. Less skilful players can    
 play the course too and take advantage
 of the excellent teaching facilities. 
 Prince's has a large practice area and
 professionals who give instruction at 
 moderate charges of Â£5 per six        
 lessons.                              
                                       
 The original course had been begun in 
 1904 under the direction of{Sir Harry 
{Mallaby-Deeley}and was opened in 1907.
 Seven years later it was taken over   
 for coastal defence and military      
 training. It was not made available   
 for golf until after the end of the   
 First World War.                     {</content>
