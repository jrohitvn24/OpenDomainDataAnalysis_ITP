		<title>11FARMING IN THE WEDMORE AREA</title>
		<content>   Most farms are run by the family and
 only a few employ labourers who live  
 in cottages owned by the farmers.     
   The working day is roughly 10 hours 
 for the family farm worker but is     
 often much more especially during     
 harvest.                              
   The main crops are grass, silage and
 hay.Smaller crops include maize,barley
 wheat,fodder beet and turnips. Apples,
 in small orchards are common as they  
 are used for{cider making.            
   There is one farm making cider in   
 Cocklake. It employs 6 people during  
 the processing of cider. The machines 
 used are all over 100 years old and   
 make the cider in the traditional way.
   Farmers own much of the machinery   
 needed with 2 to 5 tractors per farm. 
 However silage making and some hay    
 bailing is principally done by one    
 main contractor in the area.          </content>
