		<content>{Bowburn is four miles SE of Durham    
 City on the A177 Stockton road. The   
 A1(M) runs through the area and there 
 is a motorway intersection (A1M and   
 A177.The village can be divided into  
 two distinct parts; to the east of the
 A177 is the housing area, to the west 
 the industrial development on the site
 of the colliery which closed in 1967. 
 The church at Bowburn is called Christ
 the King(The Pineapple). Bowburn is   
 central to our 12km. block. There are 
 3 schools in the area, an infant      
 school(1909), our junior school (1974)
 and the comprehensive (1958) which    
 will close this summer. A major       
 physical feature of the block is the  
 Permian limestone escarpment which is 
 to the N. and E. of Bowburn. The main 
 London - Edinburgh railway runs       
 through the SW.corner of the block    
 (2837)                                </content>
