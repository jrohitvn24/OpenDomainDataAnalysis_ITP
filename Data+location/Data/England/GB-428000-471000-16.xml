		<title>16A TYPICAL DAY OF C.CARLING</title>
		<content> On friday morning it is such a relief 
 to have the school week nearly over.  
 My alarm goes off at 7:30 AM.I drag   
 myself out of bed and get dressed.I   
 lose my tie every morning,but it is   
 found after a thorough search. Then I 
 get washed and hobble downstairs      
 feeling awful.The paper is posted     
 through the letter box and is waiting 
 for me.I read the paper.At 7:55 AM.   
 I have my breakfast and then I clean  
 my teeth.We set off for school and    
 get there at 8:50 AM.After            
 registration we have French.After     
 French it is geography.Next its P.E.  
 then maths but that drags on a bit    
 then music and rural science at 4:10  
 I get home and do any homework that I 
 have been given.At 9:30 PM.I go to    
 bed after being outside to play.
