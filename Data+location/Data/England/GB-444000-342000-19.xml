		<title>19ILKESTON ADVERTISER</title>
		<content> The{Ilkeston Adertiser}is 104 years   
 old. The title page is set out the    
 same as it was 100 years ago. There   
 are{three reporters}and they are all  
 nationally trained. A reporter makes  
 about 50 reports a week. Other people 
 also send in reports.                 
                                       
 About{40,000 people}read the          
 Advertiser a week. The major stories  
 of 1985 were the{murder}that happened 
 in{Stanley Common}where a body was    
 found in a freezer and also about the 
{Britannia Park,}a new theme park near 
 Ilkeston. The newspaper believes in   
 reporting the news and in trying to   
 arouse public interest in local       
 affairs. One such campaign was against
 the new relief road.
