		<content>   There are lots of clubs in          
 Horrabridge .There are Brownies,      
 Guides, Cubs,Scouts,Sunday School and 
 Badminton. I go to Badminton,Brownies 
 and Sunday School.                    
   At Badminton some coaches teach     
 us to play.Soon I will be going       
 to the Tuesday group.At 10 years      
 old I am the oldest at Badminton      
 (not including the teachers)          
   Sunday School is where we learn     
 about God and Jesus.We sing hymns     
 and choruses.I go in the morning      
 after there has been a service.My     
 sister goes to choir before that.     
   Brownies is a club for girls.The    
 boys have a similar club called       
 Cubs .We make things and help         
 people.We have concerts as well.We    
 have just had one in July.
