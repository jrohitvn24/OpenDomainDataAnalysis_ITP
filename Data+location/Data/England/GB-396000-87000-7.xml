		<title>07LACK OF AMENITIES ON ARNE</title>
		<content>   Arne has no bus service and the     
 nearest railway is five miles         
 away.There is one public right of way 
 and also one arterial road which leads
 nowhere.Arne is accessible by foot,   
 car,bicycle and by boat.All of        
 the houses have telephones,but there  
 is no public telephone.A Post Office  
 van brings and collects mail.         
   At present there are l2 dwellings   
 ,one is a farm house of a new design  
 and one the old schoolhouse.There are 
 l9 residents on the peninsula and 2 on
 the Islands.There is no mains water on
 Arne,but instead there is a spring and
 a borehole.There is no piped sewage   
 system or gas available,but all houses
 have electricity.                     
   The extensive Nature Reserve of l300
 acres is recorded and preserved by the
 RSPB. It is  not , however, an        
 amenity as such.                      </content>
