		<title>07MATTHEW BROWN BREWERY,B'BURN</title>
		<content>Matthew Brown, an independently owned  
brewery was founded in 1830. It employs
a large workforce and has over 500 Pubs
throughout the North West, selling     
beers under the names of 'Lion Ales'   
Â£Theakston' and Â£Slalom Lager'.        
Recently there has been a great deal of
publicity because another brewery      
called Â£Scottish &amp; Newcastle Breweries'
has been trying to "take over" Brown's.
Matthew Brown is resisting this action 
and has put advertisements in          
newspapers and in its public houses.   
Also outside most of it's pubs there is
a banner stating that the brewery is   
NOT FOR SALE. A lot of public interest 
has occurred in the town and supporters
of the brewery have taken part in      
protest marches and have signed        
petitions. At present the issue has    
been referred to the Monopolies        
Commission for investigation.          </content>
