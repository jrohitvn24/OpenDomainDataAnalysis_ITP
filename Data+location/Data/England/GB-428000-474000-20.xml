		<content>{St. Helen's Well}                     
 Nobody knows anything about St.Helen  
 herself but it is believed that the   
 well was visited by pilgrims in       
 medieval times because the drinking of
 the water sometimes brought about     
 miraculous cures. In the 18th Century 
 the farmer, who rented the field      
 containing the well, became so angry  
 at the damage done to his crops by    
 visitors that he smashed the          
 surrounding wall. Now only the red    
 stones and the spring can be seen.    
{Castle Dikes}This is the site of a    
 Roman town.About 40 years ago it was  
 excavated and two different types of  
 under floor central heating were      
 found. It is a valuable historic site 
 and when the road was improved about  
 12 years ago a large bend was         
 necessary to avoid Castle Dikes.Local 
 archeologists hope to dig there again.</content>
