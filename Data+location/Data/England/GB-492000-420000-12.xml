		<title>12A DAY AT WINTERINGHAM SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The  bell  rings  at  9am  but  my mum
 brings me to school  before  then.  We
 meet  my  friends  as  we  walk  up to
 school. When the bell rings we  go  to
 assembly   where   we   sing  and  say
 prayers. Sometimes parents are invited
 to a play.  Afterwards  we  do  maths,
 English  reading  or  art.    I  enjoy
 reading  best.   At  playtime  we  can
 sometimes  play  on  the  grass,  some
 people play on roller boots. At dinner
 time some people have school dinners, 
 I  have  a  packed  lunch.   We   have
 recorder  club  or  computer  club  at
 lunchtime. Before we go home we have a
 story. The infants go home at 3.3o and
 the juniors have games  or music until
 4pm.  Some  people  stay  for computer
 club.  When  I  get  home  I  have  my
 tea, watch  TV  or play out on my bike
 with my brother.
