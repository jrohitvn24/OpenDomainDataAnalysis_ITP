		<title>10MITCHELDEAN PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content>    Mitcheldean Primary School was     
 founded in 1789 by William Lane, a    
 local benefactor who left Â£1000 in his
 will for the purpose. The old part of 
 the school is still in use as the     
 Upper Junior Department, but with the 
 population increasing a new block of  
 three classrooms was added in the     
 1960's together with a large playing  
 field. In 1976 a further block of     
 three classrooms was completed to form
 a new infant department.              
    1985 was an important one for the  
 school, for after many years of       
 waiting a school hall was at last     
 built. This is octagonal in shape, and
 includes a block of new offices, store
 rooms and changing rooms.             
    There are nine classes split       
 between the three blocks of the       
 school, and almost all the children   
 live in Mitcheldean itself.           </content>
