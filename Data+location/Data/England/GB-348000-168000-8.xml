		<title>08FLAX BOURTON RECREATION</title>
		<content> Flax Bourton does not have many       
 recreational facilities. It does      
 however have a thriving cricket club  
 which has its own ground and pavilion.
 There is a Guide Company and a Brownie
 Pack. Since there is no Village Hall  
 they meet in a hall at Farleigh       
 Hospital. At the present time plans   
 are being made to build a hall within 
 the village to accomadate the various 
 groups which meet in people's homes.  
 There is the Tuesday Club for the     
 women in the village and a Youth Group
 for the teenagers.                    
 If villagers wish to swim or play     
 raquet games they go either to        
 Backwell or into Bristol.             
 Likewise a visit to the theatre or a  
 concert or cinema involves a journey  
 to Bristol.
