		<title>14Voluntary Community Care</title>
		<content> Much of the care in the community     
 is provided  by volunteer groups,many 
 being run by local churches. One such 
 group is "Careline" which provides 30 
 visitors for elderly or house-bound   
 people in need.There is a co_ordinator
 to put people in touch with help.Local
 scout and guide groups are run to     
 cater for boys and girls of school    
 age, offering camping trips and       
 leisure activities."Pathfinders" and  
 C.Y.F.A. groups organise activities   
 for teenagers connected with the      
 Anglican churches.Mothers with young  
 babies and toddlers can enjoy such    
 groups as "The Rainbow Club" where    
 large play apparatus is provided as an
 introduction to nursery and school    
 life.A number of action groups have   
 recently been formed to help the un_  
 employed.With local sponsorship,      
 several workshops have been acquired. </content>
