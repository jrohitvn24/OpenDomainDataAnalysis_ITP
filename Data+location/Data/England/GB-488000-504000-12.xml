		<content> The penance continues to the present  
 day by descendents of the family.     
 The gates called Redgates, so the     
 legend tells, is where a battle took  
 place. It was a very bloody battle    
 where many lives were lost. The moors 
 were running with blood where the     
 gates are to be found. To this day the
 gates are always painted red.         
 The crowning of the Rost Queen has    
 taken place on the river in           
 Littlebeck, a tributary of the River  
 Esk since 1955. The Rose Queen floats 
 down the river on  a barge and is     
 crowned in front of The Old Mill.     
 The area around Souldgrave Farm is    
 locally known as Hangmans Hill as this
 was the area where hangings took place
 - hence the name of the farm -        
 Soulsgrave.
