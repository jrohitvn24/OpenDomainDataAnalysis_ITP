		<content> The Valley School,in Oakamoor, was    
built in 1891.It has a hall,three class
rooms,a kitcken,two cloakrooms with    
toilet blocks,and large playing fields.
Children start school here when they   
are 4 and a half years old and leave   
when they are 11 years old,when they go
to Cheadle or Painsley High Schools.   
The Valley School is run by two staff, 
Mrs Slade,the head teacher, and Mrs    
Ratcliff,with help from Mrs Whitingham 
and all the usual subjects are taught. 
There are 42 pupils in Valley at the

there for both Valley and Faber School 
at Cotton,with which school joint games
activities have taken place over many  
years.

pre-school age children of the area,in 
a room by the Free Church,run by Mrs.  
Clewes.                                </content>
