		<content>    {The Mid-Hampshire Railway} was    
 opened in 1865. Early services ran    
 from London to Southampton. It was    
 nicknamed the Watercress Line due to  
 its links with the watercress growing 
 nearby.                               
     A decline in passengers and       
 freight caused its closure in         
 1973.However, it was reopened as a    
 privately preserved line in 1977      
 between Alresford and Ropley and      
 extended in 1985 to Alton,in all about
 10 miles.                             
     Now the nostalgia of Steam can be 
 enjoyed by all, as we remember the    
 hiss of steam, the rhythm of the      
 wheels over jointed track. It is a    
 record of days gone by, leisurely and 
 orderly , a slice of rural heritage.  
 It costs #2.95 for adults and #1.50   
 for children, return. The Railway is  
 run by volunteer staff.               </content>
