		<title>09Mr Hardwick  The butcher</title>
		<content> Mr Hardwick has lived in Corringham   
 for twenty years.  He has been a      
 butcher for nineteen years and started
 when he was twenty-four.              
  About a hundred years ago his shop   
 was a grocery shop, but like other    
 premises in the village it has had a  
 change of use. Some shops have closed 
 altogether so that today the only     
 other shop in the village is the post 
 office.                               
  Mr Hardwick enjoys his job and tries 
 to make enough profit to be able to   
 buy new machinery. His typical working
 day consists of an early start to try 
 to get every thing ready for          
 customers,preparing the van round, and
 making up customers orders.  He works 
 about ten hours a day,and has three   
 people to help in the shop.
