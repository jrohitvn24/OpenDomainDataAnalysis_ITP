The area assigned to Hapton Church of  
England/Methodist Primary School lies  
to the south east of Hapton Village,   
and south-west of Burnley, being about 
two kilometres from the centre of the  
town.                                  
                                       
It is largely an area of open land     
about 3/4 of the twelve km^2 block     
being such. The remaining quarter is   
mainly residential - being the suburb  
of Burnley known as Rose Hill.         
                                       
Of the open land, that above 180 metres
above sea level (the majority) is rough
moorland, the rest is rough pasture,   
both are used for grazing sheep. The   
pasture is enclosed by dry-stone       
walling and is also used for cows.
