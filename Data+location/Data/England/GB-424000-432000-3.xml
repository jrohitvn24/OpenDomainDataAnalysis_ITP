		<content>{PC Jewell talks about his job as a    
{community constable.                  
 "From my point of view this area is   
 split into two parts ,there is a      
 village type of community in {New     
{Farnley ,}where everyone knows each   
 other, and{Old Farnley}which is       
 mostly council houses and estates.    
 In Farnley, because of the lack of    
 facilities for young people,teenagers 
 often stand on street corners in large
 groups. People contact the police     
 hoping that their presence will break 
 up the youths.                        
 "I try to visit all the schools in    
 this area at least once a week to talk
 to the teachers  and pupils. In future
 years I hope that these children will 
 rely on me to help them. I spend a lot
 of time going to youth clubs and other
 functions that they are involved in."
