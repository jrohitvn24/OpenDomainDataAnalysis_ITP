		<content> Plaxton's are a major employer in the 
 Scarborough area. They have two large 
 factory areas, the largest one being  
 part of the Cayton Low Road industrial
 area, Eastfield. Plaxton's coach_     
 builders are the largest public       
 service body builders in Britain. They
 build coaches, buses and special      
 bodies for fire engines, etc.         
 Plaxton's have been building coaches  
 in Scarborough since the 1920's. Major
 expansion of the firm took place in   
 the late 1950's and 1960's. A large   
 part of the Eastfield factory was     
 opened in 1961. Plaxton's record for  
 sales was attained in 1979. In this   
 year they built a total of 1350       
 coaches. In the period 1978 to 1980   
 Plaxton's supplied the bodywork on    
 half the coaches placed in service in 
 the United Kingdom.
