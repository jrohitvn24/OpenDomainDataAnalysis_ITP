		<content> From our survey we discovered that the
 majority of working parents have jobs 
 outside the village, almost 83%. These
 jobs varied from a tiny proportion in 
 manufacturing, mostly steelmaking in  
 Scunthorpe, to the majority within the
 service industries, mostly allied to  
 transport. Examples of thes are lorry 
 drivers and hauliers, mechanics,      
 engineers, fitters, and car and truck 
 sales.The second major group we found 
 to be office,trades and shopworkers,  
 including clerks, inspectors,         
 secretarys, electricians and gas      
 engineers, and a hairdresser. The     
 smallest within our major group are   
 teachers, lecturers and managers. For 
 these jobs we found Scunthorpe to be  
 the most important source of          
 employment.Brigg a close second.
