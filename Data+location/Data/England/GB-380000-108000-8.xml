		<content> School starts at 9a.m. with an        
 assembly for all the children and     
 staff.  There are two classes, the    
 infants and the juniors. The infants  
 are aged between 4 and 7 and the      
 juniors are aged between 7 and 11.    
 After assembly we go back to our own  
 classes and start work.               
 At 10.30a.m. we have a playtime which 
 we usually spend outside, and then we 
 come back in to carry on with our work
 until lunchtime, at 12.00.We eat our  
 sandwiches in the hall, and then we   
 have a playtime until 1.00p.m.,       
 although some of us have clubs such as
 recorders at this time. At 1.00p.m. we
 carry on with our work which is       
 different depending on the day or     
 time, or on what we are doing, such as
 the Domesday Project. We have another 
 playtime at 2.15p.m. until 2.30p.m.   
 and we go home at 3.30p.m.            </content>
