fire  beaters for putting out fires.We 
saw grey squirrels and lots of animal  
signs like feathers,nibbled nuts and   
pine cones,birds' nests and a squirrel 
drey right up in a tree.We found some

trees and a bird's egg.There were lots 
of plants like blackberries,bracken,   
grass and nice soft moss.The honey-    
suckle smelled lovely.There were clover
buttercups,daisies,speedwell and       
lichen, moss and fungus growing on the 
trees and on tree stumps.We saw
