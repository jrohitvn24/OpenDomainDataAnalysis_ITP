		<title>11THE HEMLOCK STONE</title>
		<content>   The Hemlock Stone is a unique piece 
 of rock which has probably remained in
 its present position since The Ice    
 Age.It is approximately 10 metres high
 and 22 metres in girth.It stands on   
 Coventry Lane between the boundaries  
 of Stapleford and Bramcote, in one of 
 the most beautiful spots in the       
 country. Protected by sand and being  
 covered with barium sulphate, it has  
 withstood the action of erosion and   
 weathering down the ages. It is a real
 landmark, which thousands of people   
 have visited over the years, as there 
 is nothing to equal it in the whole of
 the country. There is a legend that   
 tells of a church on the hill where   
 the stone now stands. The devil did   
 not like it, so he picked up the      
 Hemlock Stone and threw it at the     
 church, but he missed it and he was   
 not pleased.                          </content>
