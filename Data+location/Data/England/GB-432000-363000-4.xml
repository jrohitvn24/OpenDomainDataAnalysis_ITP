		<content> Ashover is in the Peak District Nation
 al Park and on the south-east edge of 
 the Pennines.The area has many valleys
 In the Peak district there is a high  
 persentage of Heather,Bilberry and    
 Sillceous grassland with gorse,bracon 
 and rhodedendron etc growing          
 profusely.At Wire Stone Moor there is 
 a plantation of only fir trees,which  
 are Evergreen,but no young ones have  
 been planted recently.There is quite a
 big moor near the picnic site.Around  
 Hodglane Brook there are evergreen and
 deciduous trees to the west but at    
 Smally Brook they are only deciduous. 
 The local planning authoraties have   
 given a priority to the conservation  
 of natrual history resources in our   
 area.The planning authoraties won't   
 let any motorways  go through Ashover 
 because it would frighten all the     
 animals away.                         </content>
