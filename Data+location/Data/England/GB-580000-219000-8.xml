		<title>08THE GARDEN VILLAGE CONCEPT</title>
		<content> In 1925 Capt Reiss,an expert in town  
 planning asked eminent architects Tait
 Hennell and Quennel to design varied  
 houses for the garden village.The aim 
 was low density housing,ample gardens,
 tree lined avenues,playing fields and 
 central shops.Hennell and Quennel     
 designed simply styled neo-Georgian   
 houses with hipped roofs,including F. 
 Crittall's house in the village centre
 Tait's "modern movement style" (plain 
 shapes,flat roofs,horizontal bands of 
 windows + projecting canopies) were   
 developed to the full in D.Crittall's 
 house,Le Chateau and managers'houses, 
 Craig Angus and Wolverton,(now listed 
 buildings).In 1969 the houses became  
 Council property,being changed very   
 little until 1980 when tennants began 
 to buy them.A conservation area was   
 drawn around the original garden      
 village in 1982,amidst controversy.   </content>
