		<content>   Arborfield Junior school is 112     
 years old and was built in 1873.Only  
 about forty children went.Some local  
 people helped build it.There were only
 a few classrooms with ten children in 
 each class.The first school in        
 arborfield was in Greensward lane.    
   The school has changed over the     
 years since opening.Parts of the      
 original building have been demolished
 and replaced with modern              
 classrooms.However,the main bulk of   
 the of the building still stands.There
 are approximately 155 pupils in the   
 school today.Since 1980 the population
 has decreased from approximately 220  
 to 150 children.Because of this the   
 school has lost a wooden building     
 which had two classes.On the other    
 side of the playground stands the     
 infant school.
