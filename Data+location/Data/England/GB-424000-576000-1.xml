		<title>01Cramlington:Introduction</title>
		<content> Cramlington has been here since about 
 900 A.D. It was named after KRAM or   
 KRAMEL, a Danish chief,or thegn, and  
 means Kramel's Town.                  
  Now it is a busy, pleasant town of   
 some 30,000 inhabitants, about 8 miles
 north of Newcastle, and in the County 
 of Northumberland.                    
   Cramlington is a new town and was   
 built because there was space near to 
 the main railway line, near to        
 Newcastle airport and near to good    
 main roads. Lots of people came to    
 live here from Tyneside. There are    
 lots of big new factories where people
 work. Many people travel to work      
 outside Cramlington, mainly in        
 Newcastle.
