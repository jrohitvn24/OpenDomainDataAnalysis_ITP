		<content> The average mixed farm in this area is
 of about 50-100 acres.Farmers usually 
 grow grass for silage or hay.         
 This is stored in silage clamps or    
 barns to feed to the stock in winter. 
 Many farmers have sheep.These lamb    
 from January to May.Nearly all farmers
 have trouble with foxes.All farmers   
 have dogs.The most common breeds of   
 sheep are Suffolk and Clun.Cattle     
 farmers usually have Hereford cross   
 animals.They fatten them and sell them
 at Hereford market.Sometimes the      
 animals get diseases like Popeye and  
 Bloat.Then the vet has to come.The    
 nearest vets are in Kington,Weobley or
 Leominster.In summer the farms smell  
 of hay.The farmers have to work fast  
 to beat the weather.They help each    
 other and share equipment.If they grow
 corn they usually have problems with  
 crows.                                </content>
