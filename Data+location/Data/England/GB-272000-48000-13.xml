		<title>13TRADE -  SHOPPING</title>
		<content> Loddiswell is the only one of the     
 three settlements to have any shops,  
 and it is, for its size, very well    
 "shopped":-                           
 Elliot's - foodstore plus bakery also 
 selling meats and wines.              
 London House Stores - foodstore plus  
 newsagents.                           
 Post Office Stores - fancy goods,     
 books, clothing, cards, gifts and     
 sweets.                               
 Pet and Garden - plants, garden       
 sundries, pet foods, some electrical. 
 Strands Ladies and Gents Hairdressers 
 Jeffery's Garage and Filling Station. 
 Two inns.                             
 Thus Loddiswell is extremely self-    
 sufficient for everyday shopping      
 needs. Many people however go to      
 Kingsbridge for their weekly shopping 
 and a number go to the large Tesco    
 store near Ivybridge for easy parking.</content>
