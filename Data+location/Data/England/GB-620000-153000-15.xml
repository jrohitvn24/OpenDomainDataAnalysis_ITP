		<title>15The feeling in Adisham area</title>
		<content>  There is universal acknowledgement   
of the friendliness of Adisham and all 
agreed they liked living there.  The   
peacefulness and countryside are much  
appreciated.  There appears to be no   
class distinctions, political issues or
deep local problems. Some older people 
have lived there all their lives and   
many feel that the village is losing or
has lost its identity with the influx  
of new people. They think the caring   
attitude has declined.  Newcomers are  
regarded as less friendly and wanting  
to change things. In spite of this,    
there seems to be a great spirit of    
helpfulness among the inhabitants and  
houses are exchanged in order to       
remain. The Parish Council negotiates, 
apparently amicably, with local farmers
on problems arising between the village
and farmers on such things as footpath 
alterations etc.                       </content>
