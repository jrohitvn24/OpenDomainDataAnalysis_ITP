		<title>05Wild Plants in Aldridge</title>
		<content> We decided to find out what sort of   
 plants grow around our school. Two    
 years ago a piece of derelict land was
 cleared of all plant life, for a spare
 car park. Now wild plants have started
 to recolonise it. We surveyed to find 
 what percentage is now covered by     
 plant life and what sort of plants    
 grow there. Our survey showed that in 
 two years 33.9% of the land had been  
 recolonised by plant life. After we   
 had surveyed the area of waste land we
 went  out and studied the species of  
 plant life, 26 in all. Most of the    
 plants were producing flowers. The    
 most popular of all the grasses and   
 flowers was the couch grass. There    
 were four types of grass. Rarest of   
 the plants was a solitary Poppy. A few
 Birch saplings had rooted. There were 
 also nettles, thistles, dandelions,   
 coltsfoots and many types of vetch.   </content>
