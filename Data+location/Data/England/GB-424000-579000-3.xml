		<title>03Local Building Styles</title>
		<content> The area exhibits three distinctive   
 and interesting building styles. (1)  
{Bedlington Front Street East)}contains
 many dwellings constructed in the l9th
 century and earlier.  Many original   
 features remain especially the heavy  
 oak doors, supporting pillars,        
 ornamental brackets &amp; archways for    
 wagons &amp; coaches.  Once trade was     
 carried on through the many side      
 streets, but now some of these have   
 been blocked up. eg. Bell's Place (2) 
 Successful attempts have been made    
 lately to preserve the original       
 character of this area in the {new    
{development}by using stone facing &amp;   
 roof tiling. {Milfield Court &amp;        
{Wansbeck Court}at the lower end blend 
    in well with original front street.
 (3) {Pit Rows} (Colliery Housing) are 
 most clearly to be seen in the        
 isolated community of {East Hartford} </content>
