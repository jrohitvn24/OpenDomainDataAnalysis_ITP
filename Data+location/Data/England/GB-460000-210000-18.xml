		<content>There are buses to Oxford,Thame and    
Bicester stopping at two places,outside
the shop and at the end of College     
Crescent.The buses to Bicester and     
Thame go once a week and buses to      
Oxford  go three times a week.Most     
families have one or two cars.There is 
a garage opposite the shop at which    
people can buy petrol and have their   
car mended.People use their cars to go 
to work and to do shopping and any     
outings they want to make.Other people 
have motor bikes and mopeds to make    
these journeys.A coach takes secondary 
school children to Wheatley each       
day.Some children are brought into  the
village to Oakley school by taxi.
