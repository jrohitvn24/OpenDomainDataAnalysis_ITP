		<title>18Marldon.Style Park Nursery.</title>
		<content>{Style Park nursery} has grown from    
 being a small market garden in 1973 to
 a large{garden centre }covering 6     
 acres.The centre as a nursery where   
 seeds and cuttings are grown.Apart    
 from selling the plants,shrubs and    
 tres,there is a shop which sells an   
 extensive range of things from        
 containers to greenhouses and trowels 
 to rotovators.                        
 As the nursery is on an exposed site  
 much emphasis has been placed on      
 wind protection and shade structures. 
 Around the perimeter mixed hedges have
 been planted.Extensive use of green   
 plasic netting has been made for      
 breaking the force of the windand to  
 give shade.                           
 The site has been designed to make    
 the greatest use of mechanisation and 
 for ease of transport in and out of   
 the centre.                           </content>
