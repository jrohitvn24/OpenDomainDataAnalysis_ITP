		<title>20Social Concerns</title>
		<content> Asked what they disliked about the    
 area 53% of our survey said _nothing! 
 However in one area,Lobley Hill,one   
 issue is a real source of concern     
 _vandalism and the behaviour of some  
 young people,an issue referred to by  
 37% of our respondents.A further 12%  
 said there was not enough in the area 
 for groups like the young and the     
 unemployed to do.                     
 Eduction:because of declining pupil   
 numbers two of the three secondary    
 schools in our block are due to close 
 withi9n three years_despite being less
 than 20 years old! The surviving      
 school in Whickham will lose its sixth
 form and pupils will transfer to a    
 tertiary college in central Gateshead.
   Finally thanks to the staff and     
 pupils of Lobley Hill and Washingwell 
 primary schools and St.John Fisher    
 school.                               </content>
