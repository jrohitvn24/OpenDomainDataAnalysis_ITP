		<title>12FARMING</title>
		<content> Mr.Hoskings farm owns 65 acres and    
 rents 21 acres in the summer.The farm 
 is a dairy farm with 90-100 livestock 
 at any one time.Mr.Hosking keeps      
 Fresian cows.The produce 12 to 13     
 thousand gallons of milk every year.  
 There milk contains 3\%-4% butter fat 
 compared to gurnseys which gives 5%-6%
 .Butter fat is used to produce butter,
 cream etc...but Fresians give more    
 milk.The cows produce more milk in the
 spring this is because of the new     
 grass.To keep the fields in good      
 condition it costs Mr.Hoskings Â£40 an 
 acre per year,as he has 86 acres to   
 look after this amounts to Â£3440 a    
 year.He gets 15p a litre in summer and
 in the winter he gets 16p.There is a  
 lot less manul work on the farm now   
 then there was since the machinery was
 introduced.                           
                                       </content>
