		<title>17Farming near Calbourne</title>
		<content>       The land around Calbourne is    
 a mixture of chalk and clay. The      
 chalky downland is generally used as  
{permanent pasture}for beef stock and  
 sheep. Below this, where the soil is  
 mixed, much of the land is used for{  
{cereals.}The heavier clay land is     
 frequently used for the growing of    
 kale, sweetcorn, cabbages, potatoes,  
 swedes, oil seed rape and pasture for 
 hay and autumn grazing.               
       There is a herd of{Dairy Cows}at
 Pitts Farm supplying milk both locally
 and by tanker to the Milk Marketing   
 Board. There is a second herd at Lodge
 Farm which only supplies the Milk     
 Marketing Board.
