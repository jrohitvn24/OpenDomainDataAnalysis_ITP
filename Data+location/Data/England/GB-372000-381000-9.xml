		<content> SUBSIDENCE CAUSED THIS AREA OF WATER  
 TO APPEAR QUITE SUDDENLY  IN 1929     
 AND IT IS INCREASING IN SIZE BY HALF  
 AN ACRE A YEAR.                       
  REPTON'S PLANS INCLUDED WATER IN     
 ALMOST THE SAME PLACE.                
 ON A MISTY OCTOBER DAY I WALKED THE   
 MARKED TRAIL WATCHING THE SKEINS OF   
 CANADA GEESE AS THEY CIRCLED, CACKLING
 LOUDLY AS THEY SPLASHED DOWN AND      
 ARGUED OVER POSITION. THE BLACK BLOBS 
 OF COOTS, TUFTED DUCK, MALLARDS AND A 
 LONE SWAN IGNORED THEM.               
 AUTUMN COLOURS, BROWSING SHEEP, DEER  
 UNDER THE TREES AND GRAZING CATTLE    
 ADDED TO THE INTEREST FOR NATURALISTS;
 HAREBELLS AND TOADSTOOLS IN THE LONG  
 GRASS. ANGLING CONTESTS ARE HELD TWICE
 A YEAR FOR PIKE. THE MARKED TRAIL     
 ALSO INCLUDES THE REMAINS OF AN       
 EARLIER ICE HOUSE.
