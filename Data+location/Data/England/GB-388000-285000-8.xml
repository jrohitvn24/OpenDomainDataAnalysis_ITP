		<title>08HAWBUSH COMMUNITY CENTRE</title>
		<content>    Local demand for a community centre
 resulted in a public meeting being    
 called in 1954 under the chairmanship 
 of Mr.Stan Hill, then chairman of     
{Brierley Hill}Council. At the meeting 
 it was resolved to go ahead with the  
 formation of a Community Association. 
    This year the{Hawbush Community    
{Centre}celebrates its 21st anniversary
 in the new purpose built accommodation
 erected in 1964. The Association today
 is thriving, being fully booked for   
 its public sessions. It boasts a main 
 hall which includes a stage, together 
 with smaller side rooms and it is     
 licensed for alcohol, music and       
 dancing.                              
    The centre is administered by a    
 part time clerical assistant paid by  
{Dudley}Council, and has a President, a
 Chairman, a Vice-Chairman and a       
 Treasurer.                            </content>
