		<title>03Transport in Upperton</title>
		<content> Upperton is not very well served with 
 public transport.  This can be a      
 problem for some of the inhabitants,  
 particularly the older people.  There 
 is just one bus a week which goes to  
 allingford.  It runs on a Friday      
 afternoon, but only stays in          
 Wallingford for an hour and a quarter.
 This is run by the Houses coach       
 Company in Watlington.  Most families 
 have at least one car, which is useful
 as few faciliies are within walking   
 distance.  One elderly lady in the    
 village told us that she wither walked
 to the local  shop in Brightwell      
 Baldwin or cycled into Watlington.    
 This is clealy not so easy in the     
 winter.
