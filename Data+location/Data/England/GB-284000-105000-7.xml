 early in the morning,two men dress up 
 as fairies ringing bells and shouting 
 about the carnival.At 2.00pm the      
{carnival queen}is crowned outside the 
 Half Moon and later in the afternoon  
 everyone goes to the field in fancy   
 dress where they join the{floats}

 chooses a theme and dresses up        
 accordingly.At the field everyone is
