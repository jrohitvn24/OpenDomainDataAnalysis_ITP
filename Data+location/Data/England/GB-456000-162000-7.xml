		<title>07HOUSING IN TADLEY</title>
		<content> In the part of Tadley covered by this 
 survey some of the houses are  owned  
 by the Ministry of Defence and rented 
 to staff of the AWRE; most of them    
 were built in the 1950s. There are a  
 number of new estates in Tadley       
 and Baughurst to house both AWRE      
 workers and those working in the      
 "hi-tech" industries of the district. 
 Both old and new estates are well     
 planned with large gardens and plenty 
 of woodland and open space. Prices in 
 1985 range from Â£35,000+ for a two    
 bedroom town house to over Â£70,000 for
 a four bedroom detached house. In     
 addition there are old peoples flats, 
 some council houses and caravans.     
 Young people are able to buy houses in
 Tadley and most find it a pleasant    
 mixture of town and country, however, 
 many would like tighter planning      
 controls to halt further development. </content>
