		<content>  Farming is the main industry in the  
 village. Many people work on the      
 Colesbourne Estate. The Estate has 850
 acres of forest,a mixture of deciduous
 and conifer woodlands and 1,500 acres 
 of farmland.Just over half of the     
 farmland (850 acres) is cultivated the
 main crops being barley and wheat.The 
 remaining land is used as rough       
 grazing for the sheep. About a        
 thousand sheep are kept.              
  There is a saw mill where several    
 different sorts of trees are cut. The 
 wood is used to make furniture,fence  
 posts,pit props and sheds.Some timber 
 is made up into sections for use      
 locally to make animal and pheasant   
 pens. The garage, service station and 
 inn are other sources of employment.  
 Some people work in one of the three  
 neighbouring large towns and others   
 have retired to the area.             </content>
