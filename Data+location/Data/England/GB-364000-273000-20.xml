		<title>20County Council Elections</title>
		<content> Thursday, 2nd May, 1985, was the day  
 for the County Council Elections.     
 Candidates for the Clee Hill Area were
 Mr. Reiner for the Conservative Party,
 Major Coles, an Independent           
 Conservative, and Mr. Allen for the   
 Labour Party. Posters had been up in  
 the area for a few weeks. We went     
 to the Polling Station at the Parish  
 Hall and talked to a man called       
 Mr. Heath, who helped old people to   
 come and vote then took them back home
 again. We spoke to Mr.Reiner who said 
 that if he was elected he would make  
 this area a better place. He said we  
 couldn't go inside unless we were with
 our parents. The votes went to Ludlow 
 to be counted and the results were    
 announced the following day. Major    
 Coles was re_elected.
