		<title>10PRAWNS FROM WARMINSTER</title>
		<content> Flying Goose is a Warminster-based    
 company with a worldwide reputation   
 for quality frozen food. Founded in   
 1958 by Mr Jensen and Major Briggs,   
 it first dealt in poultry but now     
 specialises in seafood, mainly prawns 
 (it is the largest such company in the
 world) and other varieties of fish    
 such as salmon, herring and whitebait.
 Supplies come direct from Norway,     
 Iceland, and Oriental countries such  
 as India, Thailand and Bangladesh,    
 where they have their own offices and 
 personnel to maintain quality control.
 There are also export agents in the   
 USA and many other countries. 305 UK  
 staff are employed. Their newest      
 development, a factory in Fairfield   
 Road, opened in 1984. Despite worries 
 about the new by-pass, the company    
 aims to expand, and make its Dan-Maid 
 brand a household name.               </content>
