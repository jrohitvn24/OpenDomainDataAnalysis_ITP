 three recreation areas.One of them is 
 a childrens playing field with        
 climbing apparatus and a football     
 pitch.Another is part of the school   
 playing fields and is jointly owned by
 the Parish Council.It provides for    
 football , cricket and organised      
 games.The third area belongs to the   
 Parish Hall and has a hard tennis     
 court.There is a badminton club and   
 indoor bowls which also meet in the   
 Parish Hall.There is a gardening club 
 which organises an annual flower      
 show.The school swimming pool is used 
 by other organisations such as the    
 cubs and brownies and it also provides
 for a toddlers swimming group on      
 Saturdays.The ladies of the village   
 have formed their own skittles team   
 and play in a league.There is also a  
 darts team based on the local hotel.  </content>
