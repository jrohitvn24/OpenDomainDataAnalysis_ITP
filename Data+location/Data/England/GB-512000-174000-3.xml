		<title>03A HOUNSLOW POLICEMAN'S LOT</title>
		<content> I joined the Police Force when I was  
 20 years old,you have to be at least  
 5ft 8ins tall.We have 56 policemen    
 and 8 women plus 2 dogs at Brentford  
 Police Station working 4 shifts.I use 
 a bike to cover my beat of 1 sq.mile  
 and a walkie-talkie to keep in contact
 We also have 3 cars(panda's),1 Sherpa 
 van for prisoners and 1 Rover pursuit 
 car.We can get horses for crowd       
 control.I arrest about 1 person in a  
 month but there are 2500 arrested in a
 year locally.Most only for a few hours
 My purpose is not really to catch     
 criminals,I liase with the community. 
 We organise a Schools Disco           
 competion and 5-a-side football.I     
 never carry a gun and never will.I    
 keep fit by playing badminton and     
 squash.I have a dog at home.Police    
 dogs are trained for obedience for 26 
 weeks in Kent with their handler.     </content>
