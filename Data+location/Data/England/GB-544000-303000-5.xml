		<content> There is not much industry in Friday  
 Bridge. W P T was established in one  
 of the old chapels but this year has  
 moved to new premises outside the     
 village. With a work force of 13 they 
 manufacture filling machines for the  
 food processing industry. Their       
 machines have been exported to France,
 Canada, Malta, Holland, Germany, New  
 Zealand, Australia and Cyprus. They   
 manufacture go-karting spares. In     
 addition they repair and rebuild farm 
 machinery. In 1980 Gas Tanks moved    
 into the village with a workforce of  
 6. They re-condition tanks, many of   
 which have a capacity of more than 150
 tons. The end products have been      
 exported to Ireland, Nigeria and      
 Malta.
