		<content>    Our area abounds in stories of     
 ghosts and strange happenings. There  
 seems to be widespread acceptance that
 ghosts have been seen on Friday's Hill
 which is on the A286 mainroad leading 
 to Midhurst.                          
    This was the location of Friday's  
 Hill House which was destroyed by     
 fire in 1800 and again in 1925.       
 Here the ghost of a maid with a       
 tray of glasses with which she regaled
 travellers has been vouched for by    
 several witnesses.                    
    Nearby there is an ancient cottage 
 where the ghost of a murdered woman   
 has been seen. She has been said to   
 throw stones at travellers whom she   
 did not like.                         
    Then there is the 'Lady in Grey'   
 who has been seen sitting in the ruins
 of the burnt out house.
