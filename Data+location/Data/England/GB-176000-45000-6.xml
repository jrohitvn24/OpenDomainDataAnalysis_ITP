  {THREEMILESTONE}                     
   ______________                      
      The village of Threemilestone    
 lies, as its name suggests, three     
 miles the the west of Truro. Recent   
 speculative housing developement there
 by the housing company Wimpy has      
 resulted in a large private housing   
 estate being built, but only a small  
 part of the estate falls into our     
 area.                                 
      The houses on the estate are     
 bulit with conventional bricks as     
 opposed to the use of granite/cement  
 blocks, covered with cement rendering.
 The usage of these granite/cement     
 blocks for building is more usual     
 throughout the county.                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
