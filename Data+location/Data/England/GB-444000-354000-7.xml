		<content> At 12.00 the bell goes and we wash our
 hands and line up for dinner. Then    
 we pick up our knives,forks and spoons
 and we go to the dinner ladies to ask 
 for dinner and our pudding.We eat our 
 dinners and leave what we can't eat   
 and then go out to play.              
  At 1.15 the bell goes and we start   
 school.In our class room we either do 
 singing,topic,art,games or project    
 groups.After about an hour we have    
 playtime.If it is raining then we stay
 inside but usually we have to go      
 outside in the cold while the teachers
 have a nice warm cup of tea or coffee.
  After playtime we do some more       
 work for an hour.We may end our day   
 either reading a story or playing a   
 game.When the bell finally goes we go 
 to the cloakroom,put on our coats and 
 go home.
