		<title>12THE BRENTWOOD GAZETTE</title>
		<content> The Brentwood Gazette is printed at   
 Westway in Chelmsford. Local          
 reporters collect information from    
 Brentwood and it is edited at the main
 office. Unlike the large national     
 papers in Fleet Street, this paper is 
 put together with the aid of a        
 computer, needing fewer workers, thus 
 saving money in production. The       
 information is typed onto a disc and  
 stored until needed. The layout of the
 paper is computer controlled. The     
 print is transferred onto large metal 
 plates and when the paper goes to     
 press, a large complicated machine    
 prints, sorts and cuts the pages. A   
 conveyor belt takes the finished      
 product to be packed and despatched.  
 The National Newspapers still use type
 set which takes far longer to arrange.
