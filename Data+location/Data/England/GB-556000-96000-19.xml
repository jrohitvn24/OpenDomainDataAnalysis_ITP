		<content>    The attraction of schools in the   
 area is their position with the sea   
 and the Downs in front and to the East
 the town. The railway gives easy      
 access from London. The healthy       
 climate is another encouraging factor.
    In the area there are hardly any   
 State Schools as residential housing  
 used up much of the land at a time    
 before the development of state       
 education.                            
    Meads area is also renowned for the
 large numbers of foreign students who 
 come to the area in the summer in     
 order to learn English.
