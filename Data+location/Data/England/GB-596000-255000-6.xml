		<content> The{landscape}is dominated by arable  
 fields. There are few boundary or     
 roadside{hedges,}except in the High   
 Town Green area where some roadside   
 belts of trees remain. Along many of  
 the{roadside verges}financial         
 restraints on highway maintenance have
 enabled a variety of wild flowers to  
 bloom. There are two noticeable{woods 
 in the area. The owner of one is      
 introducing a management scheme with  
 coppicing for firewood.               
                                       
 Most{ponds}within the cultivated area 
 have been filled but some remain      
 associated with dwellings, several of 
 which are on moated farm sites. Many  
 houses have enough land to keep a     
 variety of{domestic livestock}for     
 pleasure eg donkeys, ornamental ducks 
 and pheasants, peacocks or to         
 supplement income eg chickens, goats. </content>
