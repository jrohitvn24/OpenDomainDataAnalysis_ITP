		<content> Middleton on the Wolds is a thriving  
 village with a population of 640,     
 situated on the edge of the Yorkshire 
 Wolds.  It is surrounded by largely   
 arable farming land.  The village has 
 grown considerably since the 1970's   
 when a new house building programme   
 was started, catering for peop@le who 
 commute to work in nearby towns and   
 cities, including Hull and Beverley.  
 The primary school also serves the    
 neighbouring villages of north Dalton 
 and Bainton.  The largest employment  
 site is a poultry and game supplier.  
 Despite or because of the increased   
 growth of the village, there remains a
 strong community spirit, which is     
 evident by the number of activities   
 which cater for a wide range of groups
 and clubs, including play groups,     
 youth clubs, Yorkshire Countrywomens  
 Assoc.,scouts &amp; guides &amp; sport clubs. </content>
