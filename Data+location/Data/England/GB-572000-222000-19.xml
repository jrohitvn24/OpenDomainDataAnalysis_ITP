		<title>19Clubs in Braintree.</title>
		<content>    There are many associations and    
 clubs present in{Braintree and Rayne.}
 These permit a wide variety of        
 activities which can be enjoyed by all
 members of the population.            
    The youth movements are flourishing
 with Scouting and Guiding, and the    
 church brigades having many new       
 members. There are also facilities for
 the enjoyment of all forms of sports  
 and leisure activities.               
    There are groups which gather      
 together for musical events, choral   
 work and acting. These people use the 
 various halls and community centres in
 the area for their events.            
    From a survey of tne local area we 
 found that people in general joined   
 together roughly once or twice per    
 week. The young people are generally  
 well catered for with many schools    
 running clubs as extra activities.    </content>
