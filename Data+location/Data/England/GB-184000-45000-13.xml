		<title>13Farming</title>
		<content>  The most common thing farmed in our  
 block is dairy and beef.In our area   
 farming is popular,there are 14 farms 
 and only two of these farms farm      
 sheep. The farms are not all that     
 big.The farm is Polsue Manner a 161   
 acres. The farms are quite old ,like  
 one farm dates back to the Domesday   
 Book.                                 
  The land is very hilly in this area  
 therefore the fields are quite small. 
 Some farms are rented from the        
 Tregothnan estate.                    
   Most farms sell their crops as a    
 cash crop,(to get money for the       
 rent).The farms aren't near any of the
 villages so they can't interfere with 
 each other.All the farms are situated 
 quite close to each other.One or two  
 farms have bed and breakfast signs    
 outside.There are 6 beef, 6 dairy and 
 2 sheep farms.                        </content>
