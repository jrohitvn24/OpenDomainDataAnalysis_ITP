		<content> 2 centres of worship are found in the 
 block - Christ Church, Bulkington,CofE
 (Vicar,Seend) and the Methodist Chapel
 Keevil(Minister,Calne). Residents also
 belong to the C of E parishes of St.  
 Leonards,Keevil (Vicar,Steeple Ashton)
 and Christ Church, Worton (Vicar,     
 Potterne). The future of the Methodist
 Chapel is under discussion; the chapel
 in Bulkington closed in 1967 and is   
 now the Village Hall. Roman Catholics 
 travel to Trowbridge and Melksham. An 
 outreaching factor of the two churches
 is the free monthly magazines distrib-
 uted to all households. In addition to
 church and parish matters, details are
 given of community activities. Also a 
 personal welcome is made to newcomers.
