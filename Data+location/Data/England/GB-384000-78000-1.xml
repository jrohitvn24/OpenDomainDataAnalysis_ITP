		<title>01Worbarrow Bay</title>
		<content> This block lies entirely within the   
 bounds of the army's Lulworth tank    
 range and includes the beautiful      
 Worbarron Bay.   Half of the block    
 (southern) is taken up by the English 
 Channel.   The long ridge of the      
 Purbeck Hills reaches its western end 
 in Worbarrow Bay (square 3).   Apart  
 from the rough grazing of cattle in   
 squares 12 &amp; 4 by local farmers, the  
 area is deserted and quite without    
 amenities.   There are no roads and   
 public access is limited to the coast 
 path which is opened only at weekends 
 and during August by the army.   The  
 deserted village of Tyneham lies just 
 outside square 4 (to the east).
