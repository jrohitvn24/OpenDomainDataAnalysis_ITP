		<title>10EFFECT OF RAF CHURCH FENTON</title>
		<content>   One thing affecting everyone in     
 Church Fenton is{aircraft noise}from  
 the local RAF station. Everyone       
 questioned said they are most aware   
 of it and most inconvenienced when    
 there is{night flying;}it keeps them  
 awake.(Strangers to the village find  
 it frightening).Most people find it   
 tolerable; they become used to it.    
 Some new residents were unaware of the
 extent of the noise before they came, 
 but people put up with the noise      
 because they like the village. Aware  
 of the problem no flights occur at key
 times eg weddings, funerals and exams.
   Other effects are:                  
 1.The shops and station gain custom.  
 2.A restriction on building due to the
 aircraft.                             
 3.The annual Air Display, lasting one 
 day, creates a large amount of traffic
 and noise.                            </content>
