 The church (or more correctly chapel) 
 of St Mary the Virgin lies at the     
 western end of Raskelf.It is the only 
 church in our area,though there is a  
 Methodist chapel in another part of   
 the village.It is a small low building
 surrounded by quite extensive         
 grassland and a graveyard.Except for  
 special occasions the church's        
 attendance is fairly low,often falling
 into single figures.More popular in   
 terms of both numbers attending and   
 the enthusiasm brought out in local   
 people have been the joint services   
 combining the Methodist and Church of 
 England congregations and ministers.A 
 few people travel outside the area to 
 go to various other churches.
