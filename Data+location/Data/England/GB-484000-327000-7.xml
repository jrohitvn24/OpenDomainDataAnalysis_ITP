		<title>07VIKING WAY - King Lud's area</title>
		<content> The Viking Way is a long distance     
 footpath from the Humber Bridge,      
 through the Lincolnshire Wolds,around 
 the edge of the Fens, to the Vale of  
 Belvoir and Rutland. The footpath     
 crosses the eastern side of this area 
 following Sewstern Lane (or The       
 Drift) which forms the boundary       
 between Leicestershire and            
 Lincolnshire. This trackway may date  
 from the Bronze Age and was once the  
 main route from the Trent to Stamford 
 where it joined Ermine Street, the    
 main road to London from the north.   
 More direct routes eventually made the
 road redundant and it was only used by
 farmers to take their sheep and cattle
 to market. It is now used mainly by   
 hikers. The age of the roadway and the
 fact that it has not been farmed      
 or chemically treated has resulted in 
 it being made an SSSI.                </content>
