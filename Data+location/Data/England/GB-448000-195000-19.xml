		<title>19THE RIVER THAMES ,ABINGDON</title>
		<content>The River Thames, flowing roughly North
South through Abingdon, has always     
been a great influence on the          
town.Abingdon has developed entirly    
on the West bank,the opposite being    
liable to flood.As there is only       
one bridge crossing the river          
through traffic is funneled in to the  
centre of the town,resulting in a      
very busy, but necessary,one way       
system.                                
   The river brings many benefits to   
the town.Apart from it's beauty,       
especially where the older buildings   
meet the river,there is always much to 
see.Ranging from holiday launches,     
pleasure boats,yachts,rowers, and      
canoeists,to fishermen,walkers and     
swimmers.As a result, the tourist      
industry is very important to the town.
