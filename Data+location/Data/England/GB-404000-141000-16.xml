		<title>16THE SHREWTON DAIRY</title>
		<content>                                       
 The dairy belongs to Mr. E. G. Withers
 but his son Stuart Withers milks the  
 cows and delivers the milk. The Dairy 
 has been going for about 60 years and 
 now Stuart has about 50 cows. He gets 
 up early in the morning  at 6.30a.m.  
 and then delivers the milk. Later on  
 in the evening he washes the bottles  
 and milks the cows. He delivers       
 roughly 560 bottles a day and about   
 3,920 bottles a week. He delivers all 
 the way through Shrewton up to        
 Orcheston. He has a Dairy in Orcheston
 and he sometimes bottles the milk     
 over there. A bottle of milk costs 23 
 pence.
