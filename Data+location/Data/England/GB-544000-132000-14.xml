		<title>14ASHDOWN FOREST FIRES</title>
		<content>   Because of its easy proximity to    
 London and it association with        
 A.A.Milne, Ashdown Forest attracts    
 large numbers of visitors, often in   
 excess of 45,000 on a single day.     
 Such numbers cause problems in regard 
 to fire,erosion,litter and parking    
 space.                                
   Fires mostly started accidentally   
 are the main reason why the Forest is 
 not covered by Birch and Pine         
 woodland.  Fire alters the pattern of 
 vegetation; heather and gorse are     
 replaced by bracken and grass, which  
 escape fire damage because of their   
 root system.  Dead grass and bracken  
 increase the risk of fire but provide 
 better grazing. Heather withstands    
 trampling, grass takes over if        
 trampling is severe enough, grass may 
 then die and erosion takes place. Such
 damaged tracks are temporarily closed.</content>
