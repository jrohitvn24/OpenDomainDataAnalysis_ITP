		<content> Evidence of alluvial deposits having  
 been exploited is shown by small piles
 of stones and gravel on each side of a
 stream running into the cove. Written 
 facts, based on a paper to the{Royal  
{Cornwall Geological Society}in 1845 by
 Mr. Joseph Carne, refer to a{stamping 
{mill on the edge of the cliff.}Traces 
 of the race from "four ponds in the   
 vicinity of Lower Bosistow Farm" can  
 still be seen. A local name for the   
 northern of the two valleys into the  
 bay is{Stamps Bottoms}and early maps  
 show a Stamps Farm on the Sennen side 
 of the boundary. A description of the 
 terrain shows it to be much as it is  
 today.{Old millstones,}on the beach   
 until recently,{support the other name
 for Nanjizel,{Mill Bay.}Evidence      
 suggests{corn grinding was the main   
{use of the stream,}with ore processing
 ocurring spasmodically.               </content>
