		<title>02Warslow/Hulme End Home-helps</title>
		<content>     Because there is quite a large    
proportion of older people in the area,
there is a need for home-helps.  There 
is one lady in Warslow and one in Hulme
End who do this job.                   
                                       
     The lady in Warslow looks after 7 
people in the village and visits them  
at least once a day.  Her duties       
include helping the people to get up   
in the mornings, if they are unable to 
do it by themselves.  She also helps   
them to tidy up and vacuum their homes,
as well as laying the fire and lighting
it.  She gives them their tablets if   
they need them and does their shopping.
                                       
     She started being a home-help at  
the suggestion of a friend and enjoys  
her work because she is helping people 
and doing a varied job for which she   
is appreciated.                        </content>
