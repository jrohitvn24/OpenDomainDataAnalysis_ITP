		<title>07WADWORTH MAYPOLE</title>
		<content> My name is Abigail Haigh and this year
 I was elected to be{May Queen}at our  
 annual Maypole Celebration. Before the
 event parents make items for the craft
 stalls, the float is decorated,dresses
 are made and dances practised. On the 
 day itself all is bright and colourful
 and everyone is dressed in their best 
 white clothes. At half past two all   
 the excitement turned me into a bundle
 of nerves with the horrifying thought 
 of so many people watching me. We     
 climbed onto the float and a band led 
 us around the village. On our return I
 was crowned beneath the{garlanded     
 pole. With my attendants I went round 
 the circle throwing flower petals to  
 the crowd before watching the rest of 
 the school dance. Ribbons twirled and 
 music played. At last we trooped into 
 school and the enjoyed looking at all 
 the stalls and eating candyfloss.     </content>
