		<title>19ST.LUKES CHURCH LEAGRAVE</title>
		<content>    The{Rev J.Whitlock}is the vicar    
 of St.Lukes Church Leagrave.There are 
 about{20,000 people}in his parish and 
 350 of them go to church regularly.   
 Before the present church, there were 
 two others. The first one was just a  
 hut and then a better one was built.  
 Unfortunately some boys got into it   
 and burnt it to the ground. The       
 present church was also broken into   
 and set alight at the altar, but      
 luckily one of the two churchwardens  
 saw the smoke and it was put out in   
 time.                                 
    The vicar at St. Luke's takes{30   
{weddings,50 baptisms and 50 funerals  
 on average a year. He says the job is 
 tiring but fun. He used to work in the
 country, which was quite different.   
    The{Roman Catholics}also use St.   
 Luke's Church, and the{Greek Orthodox 
 Church used to do so, as well.        </content>
