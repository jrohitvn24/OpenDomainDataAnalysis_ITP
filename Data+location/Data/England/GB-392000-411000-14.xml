		<title>14A CHILD'S DAY- ANDREW</title>
		<content> For my breakfast I have jam, toast and
 a glass of milk. I pack my bag ready  
 for school and at 8.30a.m. I go to    
 Neil's house. Neil's mum gives us a   
 lift to school. I play soccer till the
 bell goes at 9.00a.m. We go into the  
 class and read our books until        
 assembly. We usually have Maths and   
 English in the mornings. At breaktimes
 we play football or cricket. At 12    
 noon we have our dinner. During the   
 afternoon we do topic work. At        
 3.00p.m. Tony Stott's mum takes me    
 home. I usually play snooker,watch    
 television or play on my computer. At 
 6.00p.m. we have tea and my job is to 
 do the washing up. Then I play outside
 until suppertime. I go to bed at      
 9.00p.m. and in bed I listen to       
 records before going to sleep.
