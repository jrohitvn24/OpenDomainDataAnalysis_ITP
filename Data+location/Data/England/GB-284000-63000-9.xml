		<title>09Compton Castle, Near Marldon</title>
		<content> Compton Castle is a fortified manor   
 house, which was built in 3 periods,  
 1349, 1450 and 1520, by the Gilbert   
 family. Sir Humphrey Gilbert was an   
 explorer who founded the colony of    
 Newfoundland. His half brother was Sir
 Walter Raleigh.                       
 The Castle was allowed to fall into a 
 ruin, but Commander Gilbert saw it    
 when he was in the Navy at Dartmouth  
 and he decided to make it the Gilbert 
 family home again.                    
 The Castle is now owned by the        
 National Trust and is open on Mondays,
 Wednesdays and Thursdays. It is now   
 lived in by Mr.G. E.Gilbert who is    
 Commander Gilbert's son. Lots of      
 people come to visit the Castle. It   
 is used quite often for plays and for 
 very special local events.            
 You can see the Great Hall, the solar,
 the chapel and the old kitchen.       </content>
