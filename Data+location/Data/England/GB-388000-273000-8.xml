		<content> Chaddesley woods in Chaddesley Corbett
 became a Nature Reserve in 1973       
 through the generosity of Mr.John     
 Cadbury. The reserve consists of 53   
 hectares of native oak woodland and 47
 hectares of recent plantations of     
 young hardwoods and softwoods which   
 were added to show how wild life      
 conservation can be intergrated with  
 modern commercial management.         
 A "Jubilee Walk" was introduced in    
 1977 to mark the 25th anniversary of  
 the Queen's accession to the throne.  
 The walk is marked by yellow arrows   
 which indicate public rights of way   
 and by white arrows which indicate    
 courtesy paths. There are Voluntary   
 Wardens for the woods and the area is 
 managed by the Nature Conservancy     
 Council. The Woods are a special      
 feature of the area and attract many  
 visitors all through the year.        </content>
