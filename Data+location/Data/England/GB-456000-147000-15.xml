		<title>15Nature South of Oakley 2</title>
		<content> While{trees}and{hedgerows}are still a 
 feature of the area, parts of South   
 Wood have been felled to form extra   
 fields as has the oak tree to the east
 of{Oakley Park.}Most of{Pardown Copse}
 was cleared to discourage poachers.   
 Some trees marking parish boundaries  
 have gone including the elms in Oakley
 Park killed by{Dutch Elm Disease.}    
 However, to the north of this site is 
 an old chalk pit where two large beech
 trees grow estimated to be over 100   
 years old. North-west of{Oakdown Farm}
 alongside the A30 and forming part of 
 the parish boundary, is an ancient    
 hedgerow. Along 30 yards of the north-
 ern edge, a species count showed this 
 hedge to be probably over 1000 years  
 old and therefore of Anglo-Saxon      
 origin.{Common trees}in the area      
 include oak, beech, ash, silver birch,
 larch, sycamore, hawthorn and hazel.  </content>
