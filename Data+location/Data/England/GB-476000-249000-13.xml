		<title>13Housing and Moving House.</title>
		<content>                                       
Modern housing in Hartwell consists of 
bungalows,semi-detached,cottages,straw 
thatched,convertions &amp; farm-housing.We 
moved here for instance because we     
liked the look of the village because  
it was in the country and quite small. 
We thought we would get to know people 
alot quicker.When we did move here it  
took alot of getting used to because   
we've usually lived in the, city.People
sometimes move out of the village      
since  they find there is little for   
them to do.I think the village is      
sometimes only suitable for old people 
because its quiet and some young       
people like the village because they   
sometimes do like the countryside.Most 
of the houses have quite large gardens 
especially those in Ashton which is    
quite unusual for modern houses.
