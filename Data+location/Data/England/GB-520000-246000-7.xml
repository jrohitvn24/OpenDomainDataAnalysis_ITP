		<title>07SUTTON SCHOOL PLAYTIME</title>
		<content> Two of the chasing games we play in   
 the playground are "IT" and "Stuck-in-
 the-Mud".                             
                "IT"                   
 This game is for 2 or more players but
 we think it is best to have more than 
 3.One person is "IT" and has to chase 
 all the others.When someone is caught,
 they become "IT".                     
                                       
          STUCK-IN-THE-MUD             
 This is another game for more than 3  
 people.One person is "IT" and chases  
 the others.When someone is caught     
 they have to stand still and hold     
 their arms out to the sides.That means
 they are stuck-in-the-mud!Other       
 players have to rescue the stuck      
 people by trying to go under the      
 outstretched arms before being caught.
 Anyone stuck 3 times becomes "IT".
