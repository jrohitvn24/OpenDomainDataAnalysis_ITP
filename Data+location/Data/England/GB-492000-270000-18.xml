		<content>    The Entertainment Society has been 
in existance for 21 years. This is an  
amateur organisation. The society does 
3 shows a year. In January,after       
Christmas, there is a pantomime, which 
this year was "Cinderella".The show in 
the summer this year was an Old Time   
Music Hall. In the autumn, they        
sometimes do a play or a musical. Last 
year it was a play called "Big Bad     
Mouse", this year, it is the musical   
"Grease" . The money that they         
make keeps the society going through   
the year. Funds are also raised by     
having fetes and jumble sales. The     
three shows are staged in the Civic    
Hall with full costume, lighting,      
sound and orchestra. The hall can seat 
200 people for each performance.
