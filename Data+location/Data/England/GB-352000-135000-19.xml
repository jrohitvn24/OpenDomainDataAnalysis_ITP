		<title>19The Glastonbury Zodiac</title>
		<content> The Glastonbury Zodiac was discovered 
 in 1925 after aerial photoghaphs had  
 been taken. Modelled in relief by     
 hills and part-outlined by streams    
 following contours, roads, canals,    
 footpaths etc, the 12 zodiac signs are
 arranged in correct order and         
 proportion in a circle.               
 It has also been suggested that this  
 is the Round Table with Arthur        
 (Sagittarius), Guinevere (Virgo),     
 Merlin and the Chief Knights arranged 
 in a majestic circle. Much of the     
 upper part of Sagittarius or Arthur,  
 whose shadow stretches for over 5     
 miles, covers the eastern part of our 
 D_Block. We have also got some of     
 Pisces (to the west), the horn of     
 Capricorn (to the east) and possibly a
 wing feather of the Phoenix           
 (Aquarius).
