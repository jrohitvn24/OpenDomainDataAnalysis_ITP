		<content>   Mr.Bainbridge farms 270 acres at    
 Home Farm Cumwhinton. He milks 275    
 cows,20 cows are dry and there are 150
 young animals (i.e.heifers and calves)
   The system he uses is called zero   
 graze because the food is brought to  
 the cows. He milks his cows in a low  
 line herring bone parlour. 28 cows    
 come into the parlour, 14 on each     
 side. The udders are washed with warm 
 water, the clusters are put on and    
 after the cows have been milked the   
 teats are sprayed with a chemical to  
 stop any germs entering.              
   The milk is taken to the collecting 
 tanks and cooled. There are 3 tanks.  
 They hold 550,1000 and 440 gallons of 
 milk the smallest being used as an    
 overflow.After milking the tanks are  
 washed out with 100 gallons of cold   
 water followed by 80 gallons of       
 boiling water.                        </content>
