		<title>02Tidbury Green Village</title>
		<content> Tidbury Green is an unusual village in
 that at the present time there is no  
 church, Village hall or Public House  
 which most residents feel are needed  
 to cultivate more of a "community     
 spirit" ,the parish council have      
 requested to purchase the vacant scout
 hut in order to renovate it and make  
 it a central village hall.At the      
 moment the school provides a central  
 meeting place for various             
 organisations and some social events. 
 Over the last forty years there has   
 been an increase in housing  and      
 population.The  village now has       
 piped water and sewerage.Farming has  
 changed from nearly all Dairy and     
 Cereal to more Beef and Sheep.Most of 
 the field work was done by horses but 
 to day it is all done by tractors     
 .There are more cars and lorries on   
 the roads than forty years ago.       </content>
