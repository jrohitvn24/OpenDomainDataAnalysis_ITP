		<content> Of about 3O small - medium farms, most
 are dairy farms with herds of 70-l60  
 milkers and followers, mainly Friesian
 Guernsey, Hereford, Holstein. About 10
 farms have herds of beef cattle, some 
 also with a dairy herd;  6 or 7 farms 
 are arable. A once arable farm now has
 20 Connemara ponies on rough grassland
 being resown for permanent pasture;   
 another has returned to beef.  Several
 farmers bring in keeper sheep from the
 Kent or Romney marshes during winter  
 months as sheep are light-footed on   
 soft ground, graze and manure as they 
 go and only need hay in snowy weather.
 There are two large pig farms (1700   
 and 1000 animals) which sell meat to  
 Horsham, and two intensive broiler-   
 house units of 75,000 birds.  One farm
 has turkeys and pheasants and a game  
 licence;  another has a small flock of
 Jacob sheep.  Two holdings keep bees. </content>
