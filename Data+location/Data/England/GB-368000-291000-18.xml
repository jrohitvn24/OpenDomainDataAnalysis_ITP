		<title>18The Game 'May I?'</title>
		<content> 'May I?' is a game played by any      
 number of children.  One person is on 
 and calls to a named person to        
 undertake a particular task such as   
 'take two strides' or imitate an      
 'umbrella' - a 'lamp post' or a       
 'train'.  To imitate an umbrella      
 requires a twirl in the air, whereas a
 lamp-post requires the person to lie  
 down on the ground, stretch out his   
 arms and then stand up at the point   
 where the arms reached.  The train    
 requires the person to run backwards  
 and forwards until told to stop.  The 
 game is given the name 'May I?'       
 because when the person who is on     
 gives an instruction, should the      
 person who obeys fail to ask 'May I?' 
 that person has to start all over     
 again.  The person who reaches the end
 of a marked pitch first is next on.
