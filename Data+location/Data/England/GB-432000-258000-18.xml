		<title>18CHESTERTON GRAVEYARD</title>
		<content> In Chesterton today several of the    
 graves are very personal.One notable  
 one belongs to a villager who was an  
 enthusiastic cyclist and has a        
 miniature cycle on his grave.Another  
 belongs to a horse breeder who was    
 also an amateur jockey.Each year some 
 of his horses are brought to the      
 graveside so that he can "see"        
 them.Most of the oldest tombstones are
 lichen encrusted and worn by the      
 weather.Inside the church are two very
 different tombs.Humphrey Peyto and his
 wife Anne have their eleven children  
 depicted above the tomb,including one 
 wrapped in a shroud.His relatives     
 Edward and Elizabeth Peyto are shown  
 in a Roman style setting.
