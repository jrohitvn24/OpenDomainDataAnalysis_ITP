		<content> In this area farm sizes vary but they 
 are still family enterprises, using   
 very little outside help except for   
 tractor drivers and cowmen. There have
 been changes in the past few years,   
 pigs and poultry have almost entirely 
 gone and pastureland is now mainly    
 used by sheep. The local Romney breed 
 predominate but the prolific north    
 country crosses are gaining favour.   
 They tend to be housed during the     
 worst of the winter weather. Lights   
 dotted about the countryside at night 
 show where lambing is in progress.    
 Dairy cow numbers remain the same,    
 there are a few small herds, mainly   
 Friesian, kept in modern conditions   
 and housed for nearly 6 months of the 
 year. Milk is sent to the big dairies;
 there are a few beef cattle, the      
 by-product of the dairy industry.
