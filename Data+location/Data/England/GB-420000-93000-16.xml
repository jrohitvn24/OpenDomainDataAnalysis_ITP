		<content>   "It" is a game where you chase      
 people and there are two homes and you
 run from one to the other. When you   
 get in the homes you can't get caught 
 by the person who is chasing the other
 people.                               
   "Stuck in the Mud" is a game like   
 "It" but when you have been caught you
 stand still until someone comes under 
 your arm to free you. You have three  
 "lives" and when you have used your   
 "lives" you are the person who chases 
 the other people.                     
   "Catch" is a game where you have a  
 ball and you catch it with your hands.
   "Double Dutch" is a game with two   
 skipping ropes which turn alternately 
 and you jump at twice the speed of a  
 single skipping rope turning.
