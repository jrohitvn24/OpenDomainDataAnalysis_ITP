		<content>For the last 12 years there has been an
international volleyball  tournament at
Ounsdale High School in Wombourne.  Its
name is Tachikara, the name coming from
the Japanese  sponsor of  some  of  the
early competitions.                    
  It  takes  place at Whitsun, the last
week in  May. The Ounsdale sports field
is turned  into  30 volleyball  courts.
More than 80 teams, men,women,boys  and
girls travel from all over Britain.This
year teams  were  entered from  Holland
and Kuwait.                            
  Part of  the sports  field  becomes a
tented village for the teams arrive  in
campers and caravans or with tents. The
classrooms of the school  are sometimes
used as dormitories.                   
  There are 10  separate  competitions.
The 1000+ visitors have special  events
organised for them at night as well.
