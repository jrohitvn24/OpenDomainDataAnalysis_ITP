		<content>    The Dorset Institute of HIgher     
 Education is in Wallisdown Road,      
 Bournemouth. Approximately 400 people 
 are employed there including 200      
 lecturers. Ther are 200 students      
 attending full-time/sandwich courses  
 and 1600 stdents attending part-time  
 courses. lectures last at least one   
 hour and laboratory lectures may last 
 up to three hours.                    
    Plans are in hand for the Institute
 to become a Polytechnic. Unlike a     
 university, it will offer both        
 part-time and full-time courses at    
 degree and H.N.C. level. Professional 
 and sandwich courses will also be run.
    In the next 20 years the Institute 
 will be developing resource based     
 learning. This will enable students to
 study at home. As there is no         
 university in South East Dorset the   
 D.I.H.E. will fill this gap.          </content>
