		<content> As we were walking along the path,we  
 saw{Mr. Hickman}driving an antique    
 car.  His front door had a security   
 system.  We went through to the back  
 garden.  We sat down and asked him    
 questions about the house.  We found  
 out that the house cost{Â£1,500,000}and
 that it has{79 rooms.} His back garden
 has pop up water sprinklers, a putting
 green and croquet.  His favourite     
 invention is the{Black and Decker     
{workmate.} The house has four floors. 
 He has about five or six cars.  When  
 we had asked all the questions we went
 inside.  There were various insects   
 spread around the place.  He has a    
 swimming pool with a jacuzzi.  He had 
 a music room with a grand piano and an
 expensive electric toy called a plasma
 globe.  My view of{Mr. Hickman is a   
{very hospitable gentleman.
