		<title>03THE TANNERY</title>
		<content>    The Tannery was built about 105    
 years ago,which means it was built    
 about 1880.There have been huge       
 changes all over the factory and major
 developments.Before this the Tannery  
 was a shoe factory. About 120 people  
 are employed there. There are about 30
 different stages to go through before 
 the skin is ready to leave the        
 factory.It depends on what condition  
 the leather is in to how long the     
 whole job of cleaning up the leather  
 takes. When they reach the factory the
 skins are : sorted,preserved,sorted   
 into grades, de_greased,tanned,wet    
 wheeled,fat liquored,dried and dry    
 wheeled.They are then sent to         
 Rushden where they are made into      
 shoes.
