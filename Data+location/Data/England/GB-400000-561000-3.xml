		<content> The people of Broomhaugh decided to   
 get together some money to build a    
 school and in 1828 Bridge Hill School 
 was built.                            
 It had three rooms the school room and
 two rooms where the school master     
 would have lived.The children did not 
 have school meals.They used to play on
 the village square which was          
 covered with grass and was later      
 levelled and cobble stones were laid. 
 But in 1871 a new school was built.   
 It was bigger, it also had a flagged  
 playground.                           
 This was used until the present school
 was built in 1967.
