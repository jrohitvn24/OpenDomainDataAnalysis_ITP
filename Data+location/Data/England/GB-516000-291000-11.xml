 the people surveyed spent most of     
 there lesuire time in the village and 
 the other half said that the sports   
 facilities were better and more varied
 outside the village.Of all the people 
 interviewed only  a quarter of them   
 said they did  not like living in the 
 village and would move out if they    
 were able.                            
   One of the highlights of the year   
 for the{Yaxley }community is the {    
{Yaxley}gala which is held once a year 
 in June.A number of orginations       
 combine their efforts to make it a    
 worth while day.Among the activities  
 are a float parade,five a side        
 football,children's pet show,childrens
 fancy dress,craft shows and           
 displays.There are also innumerable   
 stalls selling a great variety of
