		<content>  For many years, some of the villagers
 who  had  either  no  gardens or  only
 small  plots  of  land  near to  their
 homes, rented {allotments}on privately
 owned land along the{West side of Moor
{Road.}In{1944,}these allotment holders
 begun the{Village Produce Association.
  When this land was later required for
 the  building  of  council houses,  an
 alternative site nearby was  bought by
 the{District Council,}divided  into{17
{plots}each  measuring {9m X 30m}( with
 grass   paths  and   'cart roads'   to
 separate them)  and  let to residents.
  The {current   rent} is {Â£7  per year
 per allotment including water charges.
 The name was later changed to{Melsonby
{Allotments Ass'n} and every year since
 1945 has held an  annual produce show,
 this year being the  41st.  such show.
 The various classes are for vegetables
 flowers,handicrafts,baking &amp; produce. </content>
