 The Women's Institute is a strong and 
 flourishing group in the village.It   
 attracts a wide cross-section of      
 village people who bring many         
 different views to their meetings.The 
 posts of President,Secretary and      
 Treasurer are all held by local       
 village people.It has a varied        
 programme with day visits to other    
 parts of the area being very          
 important.It still has an emphasis on 
 country pursuits.                     
 The Youth Club which is linked to Old 
 Dalby Church meets on a Wednesday at  
 6pm. in the primary school.A rota of  
 local parents run the 1.5 hour        
 sessions.The age group is from 8 to 12
 years.They have many outings.The      
 members help to raise money for       
 equipment.The older children would    
 like to have a Youth Club as well.    </content>
