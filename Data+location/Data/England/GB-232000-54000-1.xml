		<content> 02320054 is a sparsely-populated      
 country area of East Cornwall,bounded 
 by cliffs and the sea to the South,   
 part of the village of Polbathic to   
 the North. The peripheries of four    
 villages are contained within this    
 block; Downderry to the South-West,   
 Port Wrinkle to the South-East,       
 Crafthole to the East and Polbathic.  
 Thus there is no centre of population;
 apart from the hamlet of Narkurs the  
 dwellings are mainly isolated farms   
 and cottages.{TREDIS}farm is used     
 as the central reference point.       
      This Survey was conducted in     
 August, 1985.It was a particularly    
 wet,windy, grey month ;the lowest     
 point of a bad summer.This must have  
 effected the two main industries of   
 the area; agriculture &amp; tourism.
