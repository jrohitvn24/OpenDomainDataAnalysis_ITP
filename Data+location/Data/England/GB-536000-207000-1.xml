		<content>  The grid area forms part of the{Lea  
{Valley}and straddles the River        
 Lea(Lee) which runs from north to     
 south towards London and the River    
 Thames some 18miles south of the grid.
{ Urban development}is mainly to the   
 west of the river and runs along the  
 old A10 which was formerly the major  
 trunk road between London, Cambridge  
 and the north. The town of Hoddesdon  
 is furthest north and runs south into 
 Broxbourne and finally Wormley and    
 Turnford.                             
  The main{lines of communication}all  
 run north-south. The new A10 opened in
 1974 skirts the west side of the grid 
 and by passes all the major           
 towns mentioned above. The main       
 Cambridge-London railway line also    
 runs north-south with a branch line to
 Ware and Herford.
