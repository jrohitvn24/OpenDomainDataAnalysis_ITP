		<title>08HOUSING IN COXTIE GREEN</title>
		<content> Coxtie Green is an elongated village  
 to west of Pilgrims Hatch.Some of the 
 houses date from the l7th Century e.g.
 Coxtie House and Nunns of l774.However
 most of the houses have been          
 modernised.Most people work in        
 Brentwood using their cars since the  
 bus service is poor.The grain mill is 
 now closed as is the telephone        
 exchange which is now a car breaker's 
 yard.The Peniel Academy opened in l982
 is a private Pentecostal school. There
 are 3l pupils from 5-l8. The Coxtie   
 Green Road is quite busy although it  
 is narrow and residents complain about
 the lack of pavements. On Monday 28th 
 June between 3p.m. and 3.30p.m. 2O    
 cars passed westwards and 32 eastwards
 along it - mostly business men using  
 the road as an alternative route to   
 Romford.                              
                                       </content>
