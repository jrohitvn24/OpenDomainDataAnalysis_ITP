		<content>   HINDRINGHAM is a small village built
 upon two low hills. A stream running  
 from a natural spring bisects the     
 village before running into the River 
 Stiffkey. {                           
  The village is built largely in red  
 brick and flint with pantiled roofs. A
 few modern houses are in plain red    
 brick.                                
  The fields are mostly arable with few
 hedgerows. Blocks of woodland survive 
 on the perimeter of the village. Some 
 trees have been planted in 1984 to    
 take the place of hedgerows that have 
 been uprooted in the last decade. To  
 the West are distant views of fields  
 at Walsingham, To the North there are 
 distant views of Cockthorpe and in one
 or two higher places one may get a    
 glimpse of the sea at Stiffkey.
