		<content> If people in{Wotter,Lee Moor &amp; Shaugh 
{Prior}are ill and need to see the     
 Doctor, the nearest surgery is in {   
{Wotter.}The surgery is open on Monday 
 and Friday from 9am to 1pm and on     
 Wednesday from 1pm to 5pm. People in  
{Clearbrook }who need to visit the     
 Doctor have to travel to {Yelverton.} 
 These two surgeries cover a wide area 
 and several hundred people. When      
 people cannot travel to the Doctors   
 they will come to the house to see    
 patients. In an emergency an ambulance
 may have to travel ten miles to an    
 injured person and transport them to  
 hospital. The nearest accident unit is
 ten miles away  at Freedom Fields in {
{Plymouth.} They have a dispensing     
 service at both surgeries, the nearest
 chemist being at least four miles     
 away.                                 
                                       </content>
