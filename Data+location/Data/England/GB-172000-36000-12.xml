		<title>12Stithians Show information</title>
		<content> Stithians show is a one day           
 agricultural celebration. It has been 
 held once a year for a hundred and    
 fifty years. When it started it was   
 very small. Now many people come and  
 St Stythians band, the chairman, the  
 Vice president and the president and  
 his wife march up from the shop at    
 half past ten in the morning then the 
 president declares the show open.     
 People win a lot of prizes and        
 trophies for showing their dogs, cows,
 goats, horses, art work and cookery.  
  They go to the show ground at about  
 seven o'clock in the morning to set   
 up. For some people it is the day of  
 the year. It is a family show and at  
 the end of the day all you can hear is
 traffic roaring away while the police 
 men are guiding them out of Stithians.
