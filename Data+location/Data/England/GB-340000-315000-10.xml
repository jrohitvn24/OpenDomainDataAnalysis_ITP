		<title>10SHRAWARDINE CASTLE</title>
		<content>    Little now remains of this once    
 active castle.  The original castle   
 was built in the{Norman}style.  The   
 Motte and Bailey were recorded in the 
 original Domesday book in 1086.  The  
 castle was of importance in the       
 eleventh century, during the English -
 Welsh border warfare.                 
    The castle stands 50 feet above the
 River Severn and 30 feet above ground 
 level.  Today there are fragments of  
 the square keep and Motte, but the    
 site is mainly rubble.  Any masonry   
 which does remain is probably Twelfth 
 Century as the castle had to be       
 re-built at that time.                
    As an{Ancient Monument}the castle  
 remains are open to the public via a  
 footpath, but the owners of the land, 
 Mr &amp; Mrs Hill, would appreciate       
 being asked.  They live in the nearby 
 farmhouse.                            </content>
