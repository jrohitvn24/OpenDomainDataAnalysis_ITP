		<title>17THE RAILWAY INN</title>
		<content>The Railway Inn is the nearest pub to  
our school.As well as selling alcohol  
they also sell soft drinks and do meals
at night.There is no beer garden,but   
there is a patiuo on the front with    
tables and chairs for the customers.   
The pub was built 150 years ago and is 
now owned by Ansells Brewery and run by
Mr and Mrs Machin who have been there  
now for 10 years.He opens the pub at   
12 in the morning till 3p.m. and then  
from 7p.m. till 11p.m.He is so busy,he 
has to employ 10 part time staff to    
help run the business.The pub also has 
darts leagues,dominoes,a pool table and
video games.                           
Although the building is a pub now Mr  
Machin told us that years ago it used  
to be a small shop until extensions    
were built and it was converted into a 
pub.
