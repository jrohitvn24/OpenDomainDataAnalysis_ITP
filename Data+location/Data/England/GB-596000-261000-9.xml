		<title>09HAUGHLEY PARK</title>
		<content> Mr. Williams owns the Park. There are 
 150 acres grassland, and 60 acres     
 woodland. There are coniferous and    
 deciduous trees, some young and some  
 ancient. One oak is over 30 feet round
 and is 1,000 years old, another is 22 
 feet round, 60 years old. There are   
 600 sheep, part Suffolk breed. The    
 park is regularly open to the public. 
 Guides and Scouts camp there. People  
 from all over the world visit the     
 park.                                 
 A Visit to Haughley Park. We went to  
 Haughley Park, we climbed on the logs 
 and made a see-saw and a cap in a log 
 pile. I liked playing on the logs     
 best. In the woods we saw bluebells,  
 we went right through the woods. There
 are nesting boxes for the birds. We   
 saw sheep on the meadows, when they   
 saw us they ran away.
