   Maldon has two famous churches.One  
 is All Saints Church which stands at  
 the top end of the High Street.It is  
 unique because it has a triangular    
 tower.There are only a few in England.
   At the other end of the High Street,
 overlooking the river,stands St Mary's
 church.It is built from pebbles set in
 cement.It has a hexagonal spire made  
 of Essex weatherboard.The church was  
 founded in 1056.It is used for daily  
 services.Both churches play a big part
 in the lives of Maldon people.        
   St Mary's Church tower and spire can
 be seen whilst sailing up the Black-  
 water Estuary.It used to  be known as 
 Beacon Church and was used as a guide 
 by sailors using the quay as far back 
 as medieval times.
