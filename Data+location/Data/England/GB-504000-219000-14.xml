		<content>We went to Dallow Rd to find out about 
the industry. The new buildings were   
single storey and rather like          
matchboxes some were single units some 
were joined. We had expected smoke,    
noise and old buildings they were not  
like that. Some had TO LET signs up.   
Quite a few of the buildings were for  
storage. The firms included Leighton   
Stationers, cash and carry; Luton and  
Dunstable Engineering Training Centre; 
Huntleigh Technology, medical supplies;
GWB productions, perfume bath soap;    
Darling, domestic wear; Road Express,  
collect and deliver; Massmould, plastic
bottle tops. Jervis B.Webb make        
conveyor systems and have been in Luton
since 1974, they are part of a US      
Detroit firm. They send products to    
many parts of the world. They employ 87
people. Factory workers are paid weekly
in cash, office people monthly in bank.</content>
