		<title>03My Sister</title>
		<content> My sister is only two and she is a    
 horror. Whenever she is in my room she
 turns it into a tip and I have to     
 clear up after her.                   
 When I'm playing on the computer, she 
 says she wants the pot and I have to  
 go and get it for her and so I lose   
 the game! Some things my mum had when 
 she was a girl, she gave to me. When I
 give them to my sister they almost    
 always break.                         
 Soon she is going to St.Marychurch    
 playgroup which is quite big. There is
 a garden, a paddling pool and a       
 sand-pit. There is also a Wendy House 
 and she can do painting. When she is  
 five, she will go to school in the    
 infants' class where I hope things    
 will go very well.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
