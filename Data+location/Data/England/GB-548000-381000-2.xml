 fields,dykes and lanes off the main   
 road.If you went out in the morning   
 you would see a lot of wild life.In   
 the Autumn there is a lot of blossom  
 on the trees.There are a lot of farm  
 animals round in the fields.There are 
 many fields round the countryside     
 where there are crops growing. Most of
 the land has streams running into     
 dykes and drains.The countryside has a
 lot of wild life which includes       
 foxes,hares,rats, stoats and          
 partridges. You cannot see most of the
 animals.Lots are seen running across  
 the fields and along the roads.Some of
 them get run run over by vehicles.Some
 of the farmers leave mud on the road  
 after they have been in the fields.
