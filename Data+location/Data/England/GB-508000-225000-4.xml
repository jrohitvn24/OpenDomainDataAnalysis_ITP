		<title>04LANCASTER PARK</title>
		<content> The flowers that we found there       
 were the Vetch, Speedwell, daisy,     
 buttercup and the clover. The actual  
 size  of the park is  three hectares  
 and it is used to play cricket. Other 
 sports that are played are football,  
 hockey, tennis and bowling.The        
 Tennis courts are beside the car park 
 and there are 4 courts. You have to be
 a member to play on certain courts.   
 A club plays cricket there but anyone 
 can play as long as you keep off the  
 club pitch.The bowling green is       
 private. There is a housing estate    
 next to the park.The bowling green is 
 surrounded  by small trees.
