		<content> During the period from 1975 to 1985   
 the Forestry Commission have been     
 increasing the opportunities for      
 recreation in Exeter Forest.This has  
 included the laying out               
 ofsignposted forest trails,provision  
 of information boards,and the         
 construction of car  parks.Viewpoints 
 have also been created,sometimes by   
 felling of sections of plantations,and
 picnic sites have been set up.Forest  
 trails are signposted off the main    
 roads.The walks are popular with      
 local visitors and are becoming       
 increasingly used by the non resident 
 tourists.They also provide a          
 counter-attraction to the Dartmoor    
 National Park.Walks are designed to be
 of varying length and difficulty,and  
 take visitors deep into the           
 forest.Information sheets are also    
 available.                            </content>
