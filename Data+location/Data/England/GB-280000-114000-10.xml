		<content> There is one primary school in        
 Witheridge.It is a merger of a former 
 church school and a County Primary    
 school which took place in 1965.In    
 1966 a new school was built for the   
 junior department and the infants were
 left in the former County Primary     
 building which is three hundreds yards
 away.                                 
   The school caters for children aged 
 from five to eleven and then they     
 transfer to Chulmleigh comprehensive  
  The facilities are very good.There is
 a large playing field shared with the 
 Parish Council and used as a community
 resource.There is also a learner      
 swimming pool which was completely    
 enclosed by the P.T.A. a few years    
 ago.The school also has its own       
 canteen and provides meals for another
 school in the area.
