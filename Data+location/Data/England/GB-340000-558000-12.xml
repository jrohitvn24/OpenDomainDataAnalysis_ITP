		<title>12THE WANDERING DEER</title>
		<content>  In the nothern part of our Domesday  
 area there are quite a number of woods
 and larger deciduous plantations.These
 do not form a large continuous tract  
 of woodland but are more like small   
 islands in a sea of grassland.        
  In these woods live roe deer.They are
 completely  free and do not belong to 
 anyone nor do they stay on any one    
 farmers land .They move openly across 
 the farmland to reach another         
 plantation where they feed and find   
 shelter.                              
  There is no attempt to hunt these    
 creatures,neither do the landowners   
 try to keep their numbers regulated.It
 seems that nature does this by itself 
 for there is not enough woodland to   
 support a very large herd.No-one is   
 very sure how many there are in the   
 herds but one farmer thought their    
 numbers reached about 30 in this area.</content>
