		<title>12Living in Bean near the A.2</title>
		<content>   The A.2 trunk road affects our lives
 because of the noise and the fumes.   
 Also rubbish can come from the cars   
 and lorries.  The A.2 is quite near   
 our house.  Every morning on the way  
 to school I talk to my brother, but   
 when we cross the bridge where the    
 traffic goes I can't hear a thing.    
 When they built the road they had to  
 cut a way through the middle of       
 Darenth Woods.  Now the two parts are 
 joined together by a bridge.  Our     
 class stood on this bridge to do a    
 traffic survey.  We counted over 160  
 vehicles travelling each way in five  
 minutes.  This was at 10.30 a.m. and  
 not during the rush hour.  People who 
 live near the A.2 sometimes have to   
 pay for double glazing to keep out the
 noise.  Where there are trees between 
 the road and the houses, it is much   
 quieter.                              </content>
