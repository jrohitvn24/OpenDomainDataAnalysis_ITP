		<content> THE BASE OF THE CLIFFS UNDER NORTH    
 HILL ARE IDEAL FOR FISHING.  THE LOCAL
 BOYS AND MEN, SOME OF WHOM KNOW A     
 GREAT DEAL ABOUT THE LOCAL FISHING,   
 FEEL THAT THIS COASTLINE IS ONE OF THE
 BEST FOR BEACH CASTING.  THEY GO OUT  
 AT ALL TIMES OF YEAR TO CATCH THE MAIN
 CROP OF FISH ONE WOULD FIND ANYWHERE  
 ON THE COASTS OF ENGLAND AND WALES.   
 SOME OF THE BEST CATCHES ARE OF BASS, 
 CONGER EEL, MACKEREL AND FLAT FISH.   
 IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR ANYONE   
 WHO IS SERIOUSLY INTERESTED IN FISHING
 BOTH AS A SPORT AND FOR EATING.
