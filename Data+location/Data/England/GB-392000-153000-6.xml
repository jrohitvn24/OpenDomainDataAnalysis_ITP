		<content> Edington Fair &amp; Edington Festival     
 As well as the usual fetes, concerts, 
 festivals,etc.,there are two Annual   
 events which are locally important.   
 EDINGTON FAIR is always the second    
 Saturday in July and has been for over
 100 yrs.Originally it was attended by 
 the nobility and wealthy of Wiltshire 
 and was held in the church grounds.It 
 has changed its venue many times and  
 is now a more local event,but still   
 retains the same purpose -to raise    
 cash to maintain the church.EDINGTON  
 FESTIVAL, only 30 yrs old, is known   
 throughout England.During a week in   
 August, some of the best choristers   
 and organists in the country perform  
 at least three services a day in the  
 church.Enthusiasts of church music    
 take their holidays in the village to 
 attend.One service each year is always
 broadcasted on national radio.        </content>
