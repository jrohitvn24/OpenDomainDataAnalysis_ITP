		<title>04Keswick's Launch Company.</title>
		<content> The launch company was formed in 1935 
 by Victor Hodgson and Walter Walker.  
 Six launches are now run on Derwent-  
 Water.Nine men and two women work     
 on the launches doing shifts in       
 summer from the first Sunday in       
 November to the middle of march.The   
 company has been going for fifty      
 years.The boatmen have heard a lot of 
 funny stories like people reaching out
 for the landing stage and so pushing  
 the boat away from the landing        
 stage.As it gets further away from the
 stage they fall in.                   
     Originally people used to hire out
 their own boats.Then the May Queen    
 came,she was a very big boat,she held 
 upto seventy people.Her nick name was 
 the Big Thief,because she stole other 
 peoples business.The Annie Mellor was 
 built in 1935 for Sir George Mellor   
 and it was named after his sister.    </content>
