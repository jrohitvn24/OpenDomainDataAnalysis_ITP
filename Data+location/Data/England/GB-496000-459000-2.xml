		<content> Mrs R has lived in Garton all her     
 life.She likes Garton because it is   
 quiet and peaceful but she thinks the 
 village could be tidier.              
 The village was very different in     
 1910.In those days Garton had a public
 house and fresh bread was baked by    
 four people.She remembers 1935 because
 people had a better standard of       
 living.They went regularly to church  
 and chapel but not many people go now.
           She hasn't seen many changes
 over the years; some new houses have  
 been built and old ones knocked down. 
 She remembers buying a 6 ton truck of 
 coal for Â£9.00 and is horrified at the
 price of a bag now.She mentioned that 
 the children are better dressed with  
 plenty of toys.She thinks they are    
 very friendly but perhaps not so      
 polite as they used to be.
