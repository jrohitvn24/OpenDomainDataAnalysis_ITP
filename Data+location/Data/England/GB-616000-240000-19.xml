		<title>19WOODLAND IN IPSWICH.</title>
		<content>In the South-East of Ipswich at the    
boundary of the towns edge there are   
two woodland areas.                    
 BRAZIER WOOD.                         
This is no longer a picturesque wooded 
area,it has been vandalise through the 
 use of motor-cycles and the dumping   
of  rubbish. the future of the area is 
uncertain,it could be used for further 
housing. the ever widening paths cut   
through mainly deciduous trees.        
 BRIDGE WOOD                           
 This is more protected by it's        
distance from having areas. The woods  
follow the eastern bank of the River   
Orwell, the banks are being eraded by  
the action of water. The steep slopes  
are covered with shrubs rather than    
trees,the trees being mainly deciduous.
