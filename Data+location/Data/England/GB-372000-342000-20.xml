		<title>20LIVING IN WOORE</title>
		<content> We asked children about living in     
 Woore.  They liked some things, but   
 thought some things were missing.     
{There is no proper playing-field}for  
 children, and no kind of{centre}where 
 children can just go.  The things in  
 Woore are clubs for special purposes  
 like brownies or badminton.           
 When children have been to a town like
 Telford, and seen all their sports    
 centres and leisure centres, they are 
 disappointed that{they can only go to 
{such places if their parents take them
{in cars.} Mainly, the children play in
 their gardens or houses, or on the    
 roads around Westfields.              
{At home}the children{watch television,
{play computer games or listen to      
{records.                              
 Most children are quite happy to go   
 back to school after a holiday, but   
 they like their hoildays as well.     </content>
