		<title>01Buxton, Derbyshire:Summary.</title>
		<content> We are quite aware in Buxton of the   
 historic thermal springs which give   
 out water heated under the ground to a
 temperature of 28 degrees Celsius.    
 We know because we have tasted the    
 water from the fountain in The        
 Crescent, Buxton. We've seen people   
 there collecting samples of the water 
 in plastic bottles. We know Buxton is 
 still important to the tourist,       
 because we see and hear them during   
 the short Buxton summer. We know that 
 it's often cloudy and wet in Buxton   
 and this summer of 1985 has  been no  
 exception. We know that Spring Gardens
 with its busy shops is familiar to    
 most visitors to Buxton, but we feel  
 that other areas of the town will be  
 much less known, such as{Fairfield,   
{Brown Edge, Corbar, Burbage,}and {    
{Higher Buxton.                        
{ }                                    </content>
