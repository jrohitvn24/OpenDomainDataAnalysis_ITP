		<title>07A HOUSE IN THE HIGH STREET</title>
		<content>    {Mr.Faben} took us into his        
 daughter's house in the{High Street.} 
 The first thing he showed was an{old  
{well}in the{courtyard}which was carved
 out of solid{sandstone}with no lining.
 He then showed us the old{Smithy}where
 the{forge and anvil}used to be.There  
 was also an old safe with a lion and  
 unicorn coat of arms.                 
     Around the courtyard were old{    
{washouses}with stone sinks and coppers
 for boiling water.There was an old{   
{earth-closet}which is no longer       
 used.Did the sewage pollute the       
 drinking water in the past?           
     In the house were steps down to   
 two old{cellars}which stretched       
 underneath the High Street with its   
 heavy traffic.They were carved out of 
 the sandstone.The house used to belong
 to the{Earl Manvers}at{Thoresby}who   
 gave it to a servant as a present.    </content>
