 This is an {arable}farm situated on   
 the outskirts of Great Holland. There 
 are fourteen fields, of 233.3         
 hectares. Six adults work on the farm.
 The{crops}are oil seed rape, grown for
 its oil extracts, and wheat. Last     
 year's wheat was to Mistley for       
 export. Grain which is not sold is    
 stored on the farm in 1000tonne       
 capacity barns, which are ventilated  
 by under-floor vents to prevent the   
 wheat from rotting.                   
 The farm is {managed} on behalf of a  
 business consortium.  There are very  
 few owner-farmers in the area. The    
 managing firm has final say in the    
 management of the farm.               
 There is no livestock on the farm     
 although pigs were kept there at one  
 time.Equipment is modern and includes 
 an air-conditioned combine harvester. </content>
