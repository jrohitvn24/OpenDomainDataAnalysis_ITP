		<title>14A DAY IN THE LIFE OF KERRIE.</title>
		<content>  When I woke up I got dressed, washed,
 cleaned my teeth and went for         
 breakfast. I took the dog out for his 
 morning walk before I went to call for
 my friend. We played '{sevens up}'    
 while we waited for the school bus.   
  At 9-15 school started with the      
 register after which we did maths and 
 handwriting. We then had playtime for 
 15 minutes. The rest of the morning   
 was spent preparing items for the {   
{Domesday Project}.                    
  After my packed lunch and free time  
 we prepared to practise{Maypole       
{Dancing }ready for the village fete.  
 Following afternoon playtime we had   
 recorder lessons.                     
  When I got home I made a cup of tea  
 for my mum and went to play before tea
 time. We had {Toad in the Hole.       
  I had a bath and watched '{Carry on  
{Doctor}' before going to bed at 9-00. </content>
