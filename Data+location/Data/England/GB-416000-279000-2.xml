{Whar Hall Housing Estate}             
 I used to live on a large council     
 estate on the north side of Solihull. 
 We had a house with two bedrooms so my
 brother and I had to share.           
   We moved to a new three bedroomed   
 house with a big garden on an estate  
 that used to be farmland near to      
 Damson Lane and Damson Parkway.       
   It is convenient for my school and  
 my brother goes to his secondary      
 school on his bike. There are fields  
 and trees all around. It is nice and  
 quiet except when the planes fly over.
