		<title>10Teachers' strike.</title>
		<content>  {Children were sent home}from        
 secondary and some primary schools    
 because teachers{stepped up strike    
{action}for more pay. Primary schools  
 are being hit more than secondary     
 through the teachers' action.         
  {School canteens are losing money    
 from the strike, and in some schools  
 cakes are being given away for 5 or 6 
 pence each. 200 teachers will take    
 strike action in the Sidcup area.     
 Around{150 teachers failed to turn up 
{at 11 schools}in the borough in       
 pursuit of their extra pay: Â£1200 p.a.
   Bexley N.U.T. secretary Dennis Sale 
 said he{regretted the action}but added
  "We will take further strike action  
 over the coming weeks as this is the  
 only way teachers can express their   
 depth of feeling." The council would  
{attempt to keep schools open}for as   
 long as possible.                     </content>
