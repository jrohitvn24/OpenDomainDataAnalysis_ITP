    We have been studying the shopping 
habits of the people whose children go 
to Tattingstone School.We think they   
are probably typical of the population 
of the area we are studying.We sent out
a questionnaire and intreviewed the    
shopkeeper.                            
    Tattingstone and the area of       
Wherstead covered in this study have   
only one general store and post office 
combined.This shop is in the main      
village street called Church Street and
is opposite the village primary school.
It is owned by Mr Lee.Most people in   
Tattingstone and Wherstead use Mr Lee's
shop.The shop is open from 8.30-5.30   
and closes for an hour at lunch time.  
The busiest time of day is at 3.20 when
the school finishes.The shop is not    
open on Sundays or Bank holidays.Mr Lee
and his wife work in the shop. (contd) </content>
