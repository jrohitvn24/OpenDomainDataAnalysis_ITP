		<title>16DEVORAN SCHOOL'S HISTORY</title>
		<content>  Devoran  school was built  in 1846 by
 the National Society for the Education
 of the Established Church at a cost of
 Â£310. This included a Government grant
 of Â£65.                               
  In those days the school had only one
 classroom (measuring approximately 10m
 x 5m x 3m high) with 111 children aged
 from 2_11 packed into it,  the infants
 up one end and the rest down the other
 with only two teachers!     These were
 the headmaster  and an assistant mist-
 ress.                                 
  The children paid to go to school and
 the fees were called 'school pence'.  
  Improvements in 1984 included lowered
 ceilings,   new office and cloakrooms,
 covered porch, glazed  doors,  a foyer
 for display, an infant wet  area and a
 raised garden bed. The school bell is 
 still in place but no longer used.The 
 toilets are  still outside.           </content>
