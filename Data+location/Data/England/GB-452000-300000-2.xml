 The Rev. Michael Woods kindly showed  
 us around his Church and answered our 
 questions. We enjoyed looking around  
 the Church and found that it was built
 in 1168 and is now 817 years old.     
 The Church holds 7 services every     
 week. There is a service every week   
 day at 9.30 in the morning and two    
 services every Sunday _ at 10.00 in   
 the morning and an evening service at 
 6.30 p.m.. On a Sunday, about 66      
 people attend the services and about  
 25 attend each weekday service. The   
 vicars take the services, visit the   
 sick,attend meetings and help people. </content>
