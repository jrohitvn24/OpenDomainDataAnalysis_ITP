		<content>{Dunford Hazlehead School}will close at
 the end of this summer term in July   
 1985 due to the L.E.A.finding that the
 school is no longer viable because of 
 rising costs and falling rolls. The   
 children of Infant &amp; Junior age will  
 transfer to other schools-most will go
 to {Millhouse School,}2km away. Nearly
 all the children arrive by public     
 transport (bus) from their homes in   
 the villages and scattered farms and a
 number (14) come from the villages of{
{Victoria}and {Dunford Bridge}just     
 beyond the boundary of the area.      
 Special buses will be provided from   
 Sept, 1985. The three members of staff
 have also been transferred to         
 appropriate posts in nearby schools.  
 The school survived a previous threat 
 of closure in 1982.
