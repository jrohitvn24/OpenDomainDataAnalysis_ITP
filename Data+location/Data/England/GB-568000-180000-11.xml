		<title>11FASHION IN STANFORD LE HOPE</title>
		<content> In Stanford and Corringham there are  
 many fashion-conscious people.Fashion 
 ranges from the outrageous dress of   
 Punks in their tartan trousers        
 decorated in chains,Dr.Martin boots,  
 studded belts and wrist bands and     
 their multi-coloured spiked hair,to   
 the less conspicuous fashion conscious
 teenagers whose dress style is        
 continually changing.Pop stars and    
 television personalities have a big   
 influence on the way we dress.Pop     
 groups like Duran Duran and Spandau   
 Ballet brought with them the New      
 Romantic movement.Both sexes were     
 wearing frilly shirts and blouses with
 scarves round their necks and big     
 baggy trousers with ankle boots.Facial
 appearance was very important during  
 this phase and everyone wore make-up  
 with their hair short at the back and 
 a long fringe that fell into one eye. </content>
