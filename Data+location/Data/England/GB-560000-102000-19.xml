		<content> On Friday at 4:00 pm,I come home to   
 the chaos of my sister and brother    
 fighting,so I probably watch T.V.then 
 tell mum that I'm going over to Mark  
 Coles house.Then I go to Marks in     
 blue jeans and a jumper on my BMX.When
 I get back I have dinner which is     
 always my favourite,baked potatoes in 
 their jackets with tuna.Then I might  
 go back to Marks and have a game of   
 football.Then I go home again and     
 watch TV and then go to bed. On       
 Saturday my brother will be playing   
 He_Man on my bed and I wake up to find
 him trying to kill me because he      
 thinks I'm Skeletor.At about 11:00 I  
 go down stairs,have breakfast,have a  
 game of snooker then get dressed.Then 
 I might go to the park.Then after     
 lunch I play on my BMX.Sunday is      
 boring because there is not much to   
 do.{By Trevor Butler Age 11           </content>
