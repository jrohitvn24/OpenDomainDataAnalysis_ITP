		<title>10WOLSTON CHILD'S SCHOOLDAY 2.</title>
		<content> After lunch we go in the{playground   
 for a little while. Two dinner ladies 
 look after us and we can skip, play   
 football, climb on the frame or play  
 with our own toys. In the afternoons, 
 we do work again and perhaps sew, or  
 do cooking or play the recorder or    
 guitar depending on the day. So that  
 the whole school can get together, the
 children from the Annexe have to walk 
 down to the Brookside building on two 
 afternoons of the week. First we do   
 our{physical education}as there is no 
 big apparatus at the Annexe, and then 
 we have{assembly}all together -       
 sometimes children take assembly for  
 their parennts and sometimes visitors 
 or teachers talk to us and tell us    
 interesting things. After school there
 is sometimes a{bookshop}and we can buy
 books with our money or with savings  
 stamps which we buy on Tuedays.       </content>
