		<title>09All Saints Church Hilton</title>
		<content> Services are still held every sunday  
 in the 15th Century church at Hilton  
 with a small but active congregation. 
 A fine Purbeck marble font with a     
 square bowl is to be seen in the      
 church.  also, part of the rood screen
 from Milton Abby with the twelve      
 paintings of Saints that were restored
 at the Courtauld Institute is now in  
 the church.  At the dissolution in    
 1530 the window in the north wall came
 from the cloisters at Milton Abby.    
 There are six bells, four of them made
 before 1690, two of them inscribed,   
 which are now in need of repair.  On  
 December 1st 1985 they were rung for  
 the last time in their present state  
 at a special Matins appeal service to 
 launch the Bell fund to enable the    
 bells to be restored.
