		<title>17KEMPSTON LEISURE 2</title>
		<content> Many Kempston people, both adults and 
 children, rely heavily on{Bedford}for 
 their major leisure activities, as    
 there is no swimming pool or sports   
 centre in the village. The{River Great
{Ouse}offers peaceful riverside{walks, 
{fishing}and{canoeing}by the weir.     
 Access to the rest of the countryside 
 for most in urban Kempston is         
 restricted by the new by-pass to the  
 south and the river to the north. In  
 the main built-up area there are      
 several{small playing areas}and       
{recreation grounds.}Many rely on{home-
{based activities:-}television, pets,  
 gardening, cooking and home computers.
 Two{youth clubs}are important for     
 teenagers. Few people go to the{cinema
 regularly, a combination of distance  
 to Bedford and expense.
