<title>23Village Centre - East Wittering</title>
<content>

During the last 25 years there have been alot of changes to the village centre.  A new Tesco store opened and the Co-operatvie was recently refurbished.  There are many other smaller shops (some have been here all the time) such as butchers, bakers, grocers, sweet shops estate agents and restaurants.  &lt;br />&lt;br />There are lots of side roads but the main shops are roughly on two roads making a T shape. Most shops rely heavily on Tourism.  Parking charges were introduced to the car parks in Witterings in 2011. &lt;br />&lt;br />Today the land close to the beach is very desirable, this means it is very expensive.   &lt;br />
