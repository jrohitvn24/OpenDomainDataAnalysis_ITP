		<title>16CLATTERBRIDGE HOSPITAL</title>
		<content> In 1836 the site was used for a       
 workhouse and in 1888 accommodation   
 was provided for the treatment of     
 infectious diseases in an isolation   
 unit. The hospital facilities were    
 improved in 1920 when new wards and a 
 new nurses' home were built.          
    In 1930 the site was taken over by 
 Cheshire County Council and was       
 renamed Clatterbridge General         
 Hospital. Since the opening of Arrowe 
 Park Hospital in 1982, Clatterbridge  
 has lost its accident and maternity   
 units, but has increased its          
 specialisation in particular areas of 
 medicine, especially the treatment of 
 cancer. Part of the hospital is now   
 occupied by St. John's Hospice for the
 terminally ill which is funded by     
 charity work carried out by local     
 people.
