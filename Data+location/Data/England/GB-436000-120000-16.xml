		<title>16St.Swithuns Church Crampmoor</title>
		<content> St. Swithuns Church was built in 1859.
 There were no buildings previously on 
 the site. It is a small but homely    
 church. The vicar is Rev Neil Crawford
 Jones. He lives at the vicarage near  
 Romsey Abbey. The church services are 
 held on Sundays: 1st Sunday 11.15 Holy
 Communion; 2nd Sunday 11.15 Family    
 Service; 3rd Sunday 9.00 Holy         
 Communion; 4th Sunday Family Service; 
 5th Sunday Family Communion. The hall 
 is used for brownies only as it is not
 big enough for other activities. The  
 maximum capacity of the church is 100.
 It is used for Baptisms and Funerals  
 but not marriages. Donations to the   
 church include valuable pictures,     
 tapestries, organ and a new altar in  
 memory of Jeffery Finch the previous  
 vicar. The St. Swithuns Club planted a
 silver birch tree in 1977 for the     
 Queens Silver Jubilee.                </content>
