		<content> The Hamster, formerly the Bluebell and
 the Bell and Crown, was built in the  
 mid 16th century,and cost forty       
 pounds.Until recently it had been run 
 as a disco, but now it has been       
 changed back to a family pub, with    
 customers being local and from around 
 the area. The landlord and his        
 wife,Keith and Joan Deacon and their  
 daughter Julie, who manages the pub,  
 moved in in May.The Hamster offers a  
 wide range of drinks and also now     
 offers an  extensive menu which       
 includes special childrens meals.It is
 open seven days a week,from 11am      
 until 11pm.It has at present an       
 entertanments licence which allows it 
 to stay open until 12 midnight.       
 This is not generally used, but Mr.   
 Deacon intends to put on occasional   
 special entertainment and functions   
 eg. Halloween Discos.                 </content>
