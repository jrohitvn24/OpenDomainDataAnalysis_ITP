		<content>   Schools supply many facilities such 
as gymnasia, swimming pools and playing
fields. These are not only used by the 
schools but also by scouts, adventure  
groups, church and other clubs and     
societies. Local parks provide extra   
amenities, especially for young        
children, such as swings and           
roundabouts as well as extra sports    
pitches.                               
   In addition to the watersports at   
Fairlands Valley there are very good   
venues for athletics at Ridlins End and
the Borough Council have built a       
municipal golf course at the S.E. end  
of the town.
