 We asked 22 Murston school-children   
 what type of house they live in. 10   
 children lived in a semi-detached     
 house, 8 children in a detached house 
 and 4 in a terraced house. Nearly     
 everybody lived in a 3 bedroomed      
 house. Most of the new houses have    
 pedestrian ways in front which        
 sometimes have trees and bushes on    
 the grass. Most of the new houses have
 central heating and no chimney. At the
 beginning of the century houses were  
 built for local brickworkers out of   
 bricks made in Murston. In 1971 a     
 large estate was built and in 1972 a  
 new school was built for the junior   
 children as the old school became too 
 small.                                
{ }                                    
                                       
                                       </content>
