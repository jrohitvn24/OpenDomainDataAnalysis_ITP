		<content> Ours is a time of unemployment.We read
 in the newspapers and see on T.V. how 
 more than 3,000,000 people are        
 unemployed.We decided to see whether  
 lots of our parents were unemployed.  
 We have 21 families represented in our
 class.There are 22 children but Joanne
 and Neil are twins. Only one family   
 has an unemployed mother and father.  
 Sixteen families have{both}parents    
 working.In four families only the     
 father is working.The mums are        
 housewives.We found no family where   
 the mother was the only breadwinner.  
 We live in a mainly working class area
 in the North West of England where    
 unemployment is said to be very high. 
 We wondered why there were so few of  
 our families who were in              
 employment.Our findings are on the    
 next page of our contribution.
