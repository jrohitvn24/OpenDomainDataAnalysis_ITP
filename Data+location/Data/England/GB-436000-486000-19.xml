 Monday morning and the day begins.The 
 register of our names is called in    
 silence to see if we are present.     
   Then mathematics starts,averages,   
 fractions,multiplication,roman        
 numerals,division,percentages etc.Then
 if we have sparetime we get to the    
 more exciting things.These            
 include,powered cars,sheep made of    
 clay,art-straw work,wire people,      
 spinning and weaving.                 
   "Clear away,then you may go out to  
 play"Mrs Graham says.Playtime consists
 of tailtigs which is a game when      
 someone else tries to tig and theyhold
 hands and try to tig someone else.    
 Another game is foxes and rabbits,the 
 people who are foxes hide and those   
 who are rabbits find.Whistle          
 goes,playtime ends."English books out 
 write an essay on"Myself."            </content>
