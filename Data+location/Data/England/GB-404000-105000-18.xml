		<content>      Members of the Wesleyan Methodist
 Chapel at Horton Heath used to meet   
 and worship in what was a farm        
 building - more of a barn really.The  
 ruins are still visible in the        
 farmhouse garden.                     
     In the mid 1800's the villagers   
 decided they needed a new chapel.They 
 leased an acre of land from Lord      
 Shaftesbury about 1/4 of a mile from  
 the original site.For one reason or   
 another the Chapel grant was          
 withdrawn.The villagers then built and
 financed the Chapel themselves.At one 
 stage during the building a Mr.Robert 
 Rose went to the site with a copy of  
 the plans saying the building was     
 incorrect.An argument started,the     
 plans were knocked from his hands into
 the wall cavity were they still       
 remain.                               
     In 1877 the Chapel was completed  </content>
