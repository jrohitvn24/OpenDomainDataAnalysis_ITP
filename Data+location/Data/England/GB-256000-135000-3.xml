		<content> Shirwell has its own Primary school   
 which has only 26 pupils - 11 Infant  
 and 15 Junior.  The school was almost 
 closed by the County Council in 1983  
 but parents and other members of the  
 community launched a successful       
 campaign to keep the small school     
 open.  It was felt that without the   
 school the community itself would be  
 in danger of losing its identity.     
   The school was made a listed        
 building in 1985 and, as the Head     
 Teacher was at that time in the       
 process of building a new office some 
 difficulties had to be resolved.      
   The building was erected in 1830,   
 commissioned by the Chichester family 
 whose heron crest is to be seen above 
 the main entrance.
