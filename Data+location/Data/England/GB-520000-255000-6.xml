 The clerk of the Parish Council said  
 that she enjoys her job.It is very    
 interesting and she has not got far to
 get to the meetings .The parish       
 council holds meetings in the village 
 hall.The biggest problem the P.C have 
 had is street lighting because it is  
 hard to get the electricians round to 
 fix the lights when they go out or go 
 wrong.The Parish Council have a field 
 for young and old and it is also a    
 cricket pitch and they are going to   
 have some swings and slides.They look 
 after the village and make sure that  
 the roads and paths do not have pot   
 holes.They also look at all the local 
 plans when people wish to build new   
 houses.They are now encouraging the   
 re-opening of the local post office.
