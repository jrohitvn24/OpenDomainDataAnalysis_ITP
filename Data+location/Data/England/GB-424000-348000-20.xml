		<content>  Our village has to change. People    
 find it difficult to agree how, some  
 even that it should change at all.    
  Most people feel however that there  
 should be more opportunities for young
 people to find employment locally and 
 to buy reasonably priced houses here  
 when they grow up.                    
  Here are some more comments that were
 made to us by local residents.        
  "The village is getting spoilt with  
 these new, expensive properties. I    
 would like old, farm buildings        
 developed which are left derelict."   
  "Some limited development, perhaps   
 some self-help/government assisted    
 scheme could provide lower cost       
 housing for local young people who    
 want to settle in the village."       
  "I would like the old village of Kirk
 Ireton to stay as it is, unspoiled. I 
 have been in it all my life."         </content>
