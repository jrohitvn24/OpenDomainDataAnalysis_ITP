		<title>06HOUSING CO-OPERATIVES</title>
		<content> Where I live there are many old houses
 and flats. People want to move into   
 new houses so some of them get        
 together to form a{housing            
{co-operative.}They choose a chairman, 
 treasurer and secretary then they     
 start to look around for a piece of   
 unused or derelict land. They approach
 the{council}and if they agree they    
 lend the co-operative the money for   
 the houses. The people decide what    
 sort of houses they want ie. three    
 bedroom, bungalows, flats, old peoples
 small houses etc. An{architect}draws  
 the plans. Then a{builder}is chosen   
 and the people move in as each house  
 is completed. The{tenants}pay rent to 
 the co-operative which pays off the   
 debt to the council. The co-operative 
 pays for{maintenance and repairs.     
 There are some co-operatives in our   
 area they make the place look nice.   </content>
