		<content> There is no resident doctor; the      
 surgery is at Burnham Market, three   
 miles away, whose doctors visit the   
 surrounding area three days a week.   
 Renewal prescriptions are left for    
 collection at the sub Post Office.    
 The surgery has baby, post and ante   
 natal clinics.  There is a hospital   
 car service.                          
 The nearest hospitals are at Kings    
 Lynn, and at Norwich.                 
 Fakenham, seven miles away, has a     
 dentist and chiropodist.  The latter  
 visits the over sixties each two      
 months.  There is a village hall, for 
 local organisations, such over sixties
 club, youth club, or Womens Institute.
 There is a recreation ground, with    
 plans to provide playing field        
 equipment, tennis court and bowling   
 green, to supplement the football and 
 cricket pitches.                      </content>
