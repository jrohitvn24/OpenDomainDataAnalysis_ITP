		<content>{Education in Peterborough}is the      
 responsibility of Cambridgeshire      
 County Council, administered through  
 their Northern Area Education Office. 
 There are currently 68 Primary and 13 
 Secondary schools, with a total of    
 almost 30,000 pupils. Every primary   
 school has a catchment area, but      
 secondary admissions are determined by
 parental preference. Post-16 courses, 
 both academic and vocational are      
 provided at 11 schools and the        
 Technical College.                    
 Each school has its own character -   
 some are Community schools sharing    
 facilities with the public; some have 
 specialist units for handicapped      
 pupils. Four schools are part of the  
 TVEI scheme.                          
 Support services for teachers include 
 the Multi-Cultural Centre and the     
 Educational Development Centre.       </content>
