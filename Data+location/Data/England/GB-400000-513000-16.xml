		<title>16Boldron Church and Chapel</title>
		<content>  Built in{1887-8}and commonly called  
 Boldron Church,its accurate name is   
 Boldron Mission Room.It is in the     
{Parish of Startforth}which in August  
 1980 was amalgamated with the{Parish  
{of Bowes,}thus leaving three separate 
 churches in the care of the Reverend  
 Carlos D'Aguiar.                      
  It is not licensed for weddings,but  
 baptisms can take place there.Every   
 fortnight alternate services of Holy  
 Communion and Morning Prayer attract  
 a congregation of 18-20,an excellent  
 proportion of the population.         
  A recent survey has uncovered dry    
 rot in a wooden lintel and there is a 
 risk that the bell tower may fall down
 unless remedial work is done.         
  The Primitive Methodist Chapel in    
 Boldron is even older.It was erected  
 in{1867}beside the village green and  
 can accommodate up to 140 people.     </content>
