		<title>14The Energy Park Bletchley</title>
		<content>    An Energy Park is being built near 
 Milton Keynes Bowl. It is on a 300    
 acre site bordered by the H6,H7,V4 and
 V3.When it is completed in the early  
 1990's it will have homes for 3,100   
 people and jobs for about 2,000.      
   All of the houses built there will  
 have solar power in the roofs and will
 not have any gas or electricity at    
 all.                                  
   The idea is to have one part of the 
 city where everything which helps     
 energy efficiency will be combined.It 
 is the first experiment of its kind in
 the world.                            
   The design of the Park will be based
 on lowering energy requirements using 
 the existing landscape.They are going 
 to try to create a sheltered          
 environment by lowering the effect of 
 the prevailing West winds with hedges 
 running North to South.               </content>
