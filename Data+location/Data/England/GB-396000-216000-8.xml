		<title>08SANDFORD SCHOOL:BACKGROUND</title>
		<content>   Sandford School is a school for     
 children with problems at home or     
 school (for instance emotional or     
 behaviour problems). It is probably   
 the most difficult school to get into 
 in Gloucestershire.                   
   The age range of the children taught
 is 6-17 years. There are ten classes  
 with eight to ten pupils in each.     
 There are 100 pupils in all with 15   
 teachers. The school is situated in 85
 acres of land.                        
   Mr Morris the headmaster does not   
 believe in a blackboard or teacher's  
 desk. Instead they have small classes 
 with group teachers.                  
   The social background for the       
 children is the same as any other     
 child would have in a comprehensive   
 school. The subjects taught are the   
 same as any other school's curriculum.
