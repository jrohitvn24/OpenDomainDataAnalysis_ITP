		<title>16CARDINNIS WOODS</title>
		<content>  I live opposite the Cardinnis woods. 
 This wood is under threat of being    
 made into a by-pass.The by-pass will  
 go through these woods.I am very sad  
 because I have lived opposite these   
 woods ever since I was born.There is a
 cool stream running through it.The    
 fields every year grow daffodils,     
 strawberries and cabbages.It is lovely
 to walk through these woods.Woods now 
 in Britain are very scarce.I hope I   
 will still enjoy it for years to come 
 so I hope that it will not be turned  
 into a by-pass.Most of the trees in   
 these woods are deciduous. It is very 
 pleasurable to walk through these     
 woods on a hot day because the lovely 
 trees shade you from the sun.         
                                       
                                       
                                 Alv.
