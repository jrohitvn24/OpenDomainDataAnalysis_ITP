		<title>03The Village Green, Aldridge</title>
		<content> Our Village Green was originally      
 called Hall Croft and was part of the 
 farm land belonging to the Manor House
 Farm. In the late 1940's the council  
 purchased this farm land and public   
 festivities such as bonfires were held
 on it although Manor Farm still rented
 it as grazing land. In the 1950's{The 
{Croft}finally became our Village      
 Green. Between 1972 and 1976 local    
 people fought to save{The Croft}from  
 being used for redevelopment.{The     
{Croft}is a good and popular place for 
 physical activity. We play cricket,   
 football and rounders on it. Also on  
{The Croft}there is a little play area 
 with a slide, climbing frame and a    
 couple of swings suitable for young   
 children. I think{The Croft}is good   
 because it is near the town centre and
 there is a large expanse of grass for 
 playing on when your mum is shopping. </content>
