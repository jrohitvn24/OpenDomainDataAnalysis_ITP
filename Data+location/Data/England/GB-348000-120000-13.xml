		<title>13ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIG</title>
		<content>  The dig is in the South_west of      
 Ilchester which is an important Roman 
 site.The site was to have a cheese    
 factory on it but it was thought that 
 there was something of importance     
 there,so building was delayed.        
 The dig had four people working on    
 it,one of whom was an archaeologist.On
 the site there were six large pits    
 which were dug for the gravel for the 
 roads.The pits were then filled with  
 rubbish after the gravel had been     
 taken out.The rubbbish consisted of   
 broken cutlery and then stones and    
 gravel were placed on top.The dig also
 uncovered some walls which could be   
 the remains of some sort of house or  
 building.Whilst searching for more    
 pits,the dig discovered an Anglo_Saxon
 path running across all these pits.
