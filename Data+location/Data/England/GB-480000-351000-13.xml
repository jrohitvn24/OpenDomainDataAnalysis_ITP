		<title>13WILDLIFE IN THE VILLAGE</title>
		<content>   Off London Road there is a lake     
 which was a gravel pit until it was   
 worked out in the 1960's. A housing   
 estate has recently been built on part
 of the workings.                      
   Mr.C.Fletcher, who is the Water     
 Bailiff for the local angling club, is
 not too optimistic about the future of
 the lake as a nature reserve. The     
 building work has meant that people   
 can get to the lake more easily. Some 
 of them seem to enjoy breaking down   
 trees, picking flowers and disturbing 
 nests of many water birds.            
   It is intended to cut a piece of the
 land off from the rest to form an     
 island so that the wildlife can       
 continue. Mr. Fletcher, however, does 
 not believe that this will solve all  
 of the problems.
