		<title>20Low Town - High Town</title>
		<content> As the River Severn makes it way down 
 to the Bristol Channel it winds       
 through the Severn Valley and in      
 Bridgnorth, divides the town into Low 
 Town and High Town.  A steep road,    
 skirting the remains of the Castle    
 which lean perilously, takes tourists 
 into the centre of High Town.  From   
 here, it is possible to walk along the
 Castle Walk overlooking the River and 
 Low Town below.  King Charles is      
 alleged to have said that the view    
 from here was the best in his kingdom.
 Traditionally, people have associated 
 Low Town with the rough characters who
 made their living from the river and  
 its various trades and High Town with 
 the traders, the burgesses and the    
 more noble folk of Bridgnorth.  In the
 20th. century, great efforts have been
 made to develop Low Town and to remove
 the division that has existed so long.</content>
