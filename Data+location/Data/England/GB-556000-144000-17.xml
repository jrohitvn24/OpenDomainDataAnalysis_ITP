		<content> Three national{supermarkets}dominate  
 the food trade.The newly built        
{Sainsbury/Bentall}complex enables     
 shoppers to move from one store to    
 another within the building.There     
 remain only a few{grocers}and{bakers  
 in the High Street with the odd       
 general store in some housing areas.  
 These are mostly later{19th}or early  
{20th}century buildings.               
 Most of the national and regional     
{Estate Agents,Building Societies}and  
{Banks}are represented mainly in the   
 very old listed buildings.            
 Outfitters cater mainly for men.Ladies
 are served by only a few shops and    
 Bentalls.                             
 Any style of furniture can be bought, 
 from antique to modern.               
 The{Do_it_yourself}enthusiast is      
 provided with two very large shops.
