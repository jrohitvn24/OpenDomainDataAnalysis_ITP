		<content>      Brunswick is a Junior High School
 close to the city centre.   It is a   
 Group 5 school with about 300 children
 on roll, in what is designated a      
 Social Priority Area.   The school    
 buildings are about 100 years old and 
 during their history were once used   
 for the local College of Commerce.    
 The school has a wide and varied      
 curriculum and maintains strong links 
 with the community.                   
      This block was surveyed with the 
 co-operation of three schools.   The  
 compilers were John Swales, Mike      
 Waterhouse, Sylvia Nicholson, Val     
 Gibson (Clifton), Colin Middleton     
 (Stepney), Pam Rose, Arline Cundill   
 (Brunswick) and many pupils, parents  
 and staff who all played their part.
