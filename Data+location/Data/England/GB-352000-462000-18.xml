		<title>18THE HERMITAGE,CATON</title>
		<content>The Hermitage old people's home is     
situated near the Crook OÂ£Lune.It is   
almost surrounded by trees.Near it is  
the Lancaster to Wennington railway,   
which is now converted into a          
footpath.  The Hermitage was built in  
1849 by a lawyer called John Sharpe as 
a private mansion.Just before the war  
it was changed into a hotel.The largest
bedroom in the house was once a cafe in
the hotel and what is now the dining   
room was a ballroom.Not many people had
cars to come to the hotel,so the hotel 
was changed into an old folks'home.The 
house has 10 bedrooms,3 lounges,1      
kitchen and numerous other rooms.The   
grounds have an area of 2 acres and    
sometimes the residents are taken to   
the Crook OÂ£Lune.There are 39 staff    
and 29 residents.There is supposed to  
be a ghost called The Little Old Lady  
In Grey on the first floor.            </content>
