		<content>{(HOME LIFE CONTINUED)}As part of the  
 survey pupils were asked questions    
 about themselves. We found out that   
 forty nine pupils had their own       
 bedroom.Whereas fourteen pupils shared
 with one other person and one person  
 shared with three brothers.On a week  
 day the average time of getting up was
 7.00am.On a weekend it was 9.00am -   
 9.30am.Thirty nine pupils that we     
 interviewed said they ate cereals for 
 breakfast, seventeen said that they   
 ate toast, six had coffee and the rest
 ate nothing.On Saturday mornings most 
 pupils go to town, others watch       
 television.All the rest play football 
 or games.Most pupils call for their   
 friends.The most popular pastimes are 
 sport and television which most of    
 them do with their families.We also   
 concluded that dogs and cats are the  
 most popular family pets.             </content>
