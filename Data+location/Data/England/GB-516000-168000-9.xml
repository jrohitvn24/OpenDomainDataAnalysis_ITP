		<title>09BUSES, KINGSTON</title>
		<content> A bus stop is where people wait for a 
 bus. At a "request"bus stop you have  
 to put your hand to let the driver    
 know you want to get on his bus.  The 
 number 65 bus goes along the Richmond 
 Road.  It comes all the way from      
 Chessington and goes to Ealing.  The  
 buses come along about every 10       
 minutes.  The maximum fare is 30p.    
 For a short distance the minimum fare 
 is 25p.  Children pay half and old age
 pensioners travel free.  Our buses are
 part of{London Transport. }Some double
 deckers, which have 72 seats and some 
 are single deckers.  Pay-as-you-enter 
 buses have front entrance doors and   
 middle exit doors.  Most buses are red
 but the country buses are green.      
 There are advertisements inside and   
 outside the buses.  The garage for    
 Kingston is at Norbiton.  3 people bus
 to school.                            </content>
