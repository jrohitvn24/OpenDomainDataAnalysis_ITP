		<title>04A LANGPORT BOY'S DAY</title>
		<content>   I am 10 years old and live in       
 Brooklands, Langport. I attend Huish  
 Episcopi C.P. School. On 10th June    
 1985 I got up at 7.30 and ate my      
 breakfast;a bowl of Cornflakes, toast 
 and a cup of tea.                     
   I got to school at 9.06. Today we   
 learnt about square centimetres and we
 also drew the house we would like to  
 live in. At 11.40 we had P.E. in the  
 playground. We had  a recorder        
 practice at 12.10 (I am the only boy  
 who plays).                           
   For lunch I had sandwiches ,apple,  
 biscuits, and orange squash but some  
 children had a school meal. At 1.25 we
 continued our work and went home at   
 3.40.                                 
   I saw to my pets; a goldfish, a     
 budgie and three male guinea pigs. As 
 it rained I stayed in and watched T.V.
 until 9.48 when I went to bed.        </content>
