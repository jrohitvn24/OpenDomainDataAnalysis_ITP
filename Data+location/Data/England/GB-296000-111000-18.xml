		<title>18LAW &amp; ORDER_COMMUNITY POLICE</title>
		<content>   The Tiverton area has as much{crime 
 per head as the cities of Exeter and  
 Plymouth. The{police force}consists of
 30 male and 3 female officers and 22  
 'special' constables.  They work in 8 
 hour shifts. They{need help from the  
{community}because crime can be        
 prevented and discovered much better  
 if everybody co-operates.             
   The police have a{Schools and       
{Community Liaison Officer}who tries to
 get people to support them. He visits 
 schools, gives tours of the Police    
 Station, including the 3 cells, and   
 talks to groups about the work of the 
 police.                               
   After our visit to the Police       
 Station we took a{vote}about whether  
 we liked and trusted our police force.
 26 children did trust the police and 3
 did not.
