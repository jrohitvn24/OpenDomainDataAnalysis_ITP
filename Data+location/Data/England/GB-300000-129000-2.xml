		<title>02LANDSCAPE OF THE AREA</title>
		<content> The area is hilly, much of it being   
 over 300m above sea level. Many small 
 valleys cut into the hills and there  
 is some woodland on the slopes of the 
 valley sides.                         
                                       
 There is only one 'main' road, the B  
 3190 running north to south through   
 the area, the other roads are narrow  
 and twisting with the traditional high
 Devon banks on both sides. These are  
 high earth banks often with a hedge or
 trees planted on top. This makes      
 driving along them quite difficult    
 because there are many 'blind'        
 corners.                              
 In the winter these deeply set roads  
 fill with snow but in summer they are 
 quite different. In July the banks are
 covered with wild flowers such as     
 foxgloves and the air between them is 
 warm and full of the smell of summer. </content>
