		<title>07My parents' shop</title>
		<content> My name is Rebecca.                   
 My mother and father own a shop.      
 It is in Milton.They sell mostly milk,
 bread,biscuits and crisps.Their       
 neighbourhood is very friendly.The    
 customers are from all walks of life. 
 Most people are helpful and           
 approximately 300 people come into the
 shop in a day.The busiest day is      
 Friday because there are orders to be 
 made up and delivered as well as      
 weekend shopping. Deliveries are twice
 a week.For them it is a very difficult
 life in the shop.Most people shop here
 and not elsewhere because they might  
 just live round the corner or because 
 they could want personal service.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
