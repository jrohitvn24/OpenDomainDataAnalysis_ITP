		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content>       The section we are investigating
 is mainly countryside.Within the      
 stipulated area there is a factory    
 which makes nuts and bolts,but the    
 area is mainly residential in         
 character.Contained within our        
 boundary is a cemetery,which borders  
 on a local amenity area.Also within   
 our area of study can be              
 found,farmland of two types:_         
 1.Intensively managed grassland.      
 2.Enclosed rough grazing.             
     Unenclosed moorland makes up the  
 larger part of the land in this       
 section of Horwich,but there is to be 
 found odd patches of woodland and     
 uncultivated non-woodland vegetation. 
     On the high ground there is a     
 working quarry and there are          
 worked-out mines attributed to coal   
 and lead-mining of the nineteenth     
 century.There are also two reservoirs.</content>
