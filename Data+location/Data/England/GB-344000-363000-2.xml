		<title>02SUNDAY FOR A WAVERTON BOY</title>
		<content> It's Sunday.I wake at  8-00 a.m, wash,
 dress, breakfast on bacon butties and 
 feed my pet rabbit.Then I pack my Dads
 breakfast and take it to him to eat   
 between services.I change into my     
 choir robes,light the altar candles,  
 then put up the hymn boards.The       
 service starts at 10-15 a.m..While we 
 have our service there is a Sunday    
 School for the young children.        
 Afterwards adults meet for            
 refreshments in the Village Hall,while
 children play games in the playground.
 At noon  Dad and I go to Christleton  
 Mill Stores for the Sunday papers.    
 Back at home  Julie, my sister, and   
 Mum  prepare our roast dinner.During  
 the afternoon I play with my          
 friends,but at 6-00p.m. I get ready to
 go into church for Evensong with      
 sermon at 6-30p.m..When I get back    
 home I have a bath and go to bed.     </content>
