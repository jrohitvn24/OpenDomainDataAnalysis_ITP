		<title>14WALKER'S COACHES, ANDERTON.</title>
		<content> We decided to interview Walker's Ltd. 
 because it is the main coach company  
 providing school transport in the     
 area. Mrs. Vicky Walker was a teacher 
 and her husband was a butcher when, in
 1964, they were in York and saw a bus.
 It was purple and white and they liked
 the look of it, so they decided to    
 start a company of their own. They    
 realized there would be a lot of      
 business with schools. They now have a
 fleet of 42 coaches, costing between  
 Â£60,000 and Â£80,000. Sixteen people   
 are employed in the office plus all   
 their drivers. They buy approximately 
 6,000 gallons of fuel every six weeks.
 Most of their business is conducted in
 this country but they are branching   
 out into Continental travel and it is 
 hoped the firm will expand further,   
 providing more local employment.
