		<title>16LIFE STYLES- Boosbeck surv.</title>
		<content>      Boosbeck is a very small place.  
 It is named after a beck called Boo's.
 The name means 'The stream by the     
 cowshed'.                             
      There are few houses. In 1985 32 
 houses were planned and 72 were       
 demolished. The population has        
 decreased over the years. Between 1981
 and 1985 for instance, the numbers    
 dropped by 103 to give a population of
 982. This has happened because the    
 mines and railway have closed down.   
      Apart from the local farms the   
 industry with most empoyed people is  
 the abattoir. The meat produced is    
 local.                                
      To improve Boosbeck you would    
 need new shops and houses. One of the 
 only new things built is Lockwood     
 Primary School. I think that there    
 should be other new facilities in the 
 town, for children.                   </content>
