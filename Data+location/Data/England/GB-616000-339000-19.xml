		<title>19THE ROMAN CAMP CARAVAN SITE</title>
		<content>   In the Roman Camp area of Aylmerton 
 and West Runton there are two{caravan 
{sites}set in woodland.  The Roman Camp
 site covers about 2.5 hectares and is 
 divided into{touring}caravans,{private
 static caravans, also shop, toilets,  
 showers and a telephone.              
  The site is open Easter to October - 
 the main{holiday}period being July and
 August, as well as Spring Bank        
 Holiday.  There is accommodation      
 during the season for seventy-four    
 static caravans and various other     
 tourers, they do not allow tents.     
  The owners belong to the National    
 Federation of Site Owners.  Caravan   
 holidays have changed in recent years,
 because people used to come for a     
 roughly one-to-two night stay.  Now,  
 they cannot, because of the continual 
 rising price of petrol, so now the    
 stays are longer.                     </content>
