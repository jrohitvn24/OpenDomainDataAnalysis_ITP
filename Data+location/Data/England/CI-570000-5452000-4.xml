		<content>    Mr. De la Haye has kindly let      
 scientists do an experiment on one of 
 the farm's best cows. The object of   
 the experiment is to get more calves  
 out of one cow. The reason for this is
 that the cow on which they are        
 experimenting produces better milk,   
 and the cow's good points go over into
 it's calves. They have put a drug into
 the cow called a fertility drug. This 
 is to get more eggs out of the cow.   
 When they have done that they plant   
 the eggs into some other cows by      
 operating on them. The result of this 
 is that they hope to get more and     
 better milk from the cows, and more   
 calves in one mating season.
