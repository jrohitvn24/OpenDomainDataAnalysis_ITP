		<content> The landscape is entirely rural with  
 the farmland being divided into fields
 bounded by well kept hedges. These    
 hedges are trimmed annually and       
 'layed' regularly, helping to make the
 area one of the best hunting regions  
 in the country.                       
   Many of the fields are of moderate  
 size and retain the ancient hedgerows,
 shown by lines of isolated trees in an
 open field,  however some boundaries  
 have been removed for large scale     
 arable cultivation.                   
  The main area of woodland is the John
 O'Gaunt Fox Covert composed of        
 deciduous trees and bushes. Bridle    
 ways and small paths criss-cross the  
 wood in all directions.               
  A disused railway line, overgrown    
 with grass and other vegetation,  is  
 an obvious feature running as an      
 embankment and a cutting.             </content>
