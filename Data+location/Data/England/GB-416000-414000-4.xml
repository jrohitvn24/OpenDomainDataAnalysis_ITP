		<content>    The major road running through our 
 area is the{A642}between{Huddersfield}
 and{Wakefield.} It divides at         
 Waterloo, the other fork becoming the 
{A629}to{Sheffield.} Thus, much of the 
 traffic flows between these three busy
 centres.  Also, the roads link the M62
 and Ml motorways.  Where the two roads
 diverge is the Yorkshire Traction bus 
 depot at Waterloo.                    
{Yorkshire Traction Bus Depot}         
    The station holds l8 double decker 
 and lO single decker buses.           
 Twenty-three buses are out daily, the 
 others being serviced.  There are 82  
 drivers but no conductors, l2         
 mechanics, 5 inspectors and 4 office  
 staff.  The staff work shifts of 8    
 hours l8 minutes or about 43 hours    
 weekly, and there is a canteen at the 
 depot.  There are machines which steam
 clean, or wash, the buses.            </content>
