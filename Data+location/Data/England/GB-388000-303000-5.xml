When we arived at the church we met the
vicar.His name was Mr Taylor and he    
came from St James Church. We went into
the lounge to aske him some questions. 
They have clubs at the church.They have
got Brownies and they used to have     
Sunday school.They don,t do it any more
because not enough children come toit.
