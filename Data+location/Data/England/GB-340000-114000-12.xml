		<title>12PETS</title>
		<content> The pets I have are a black and white 
 border collie, a cat, two kittens and 
 four guinea pigs. I love all my pets. 
 Nelly my dog is a little pest.        
 Sometimes she gets my family's        
 slippers and runs off with them. The  
 colours of my guinea pigs are black,  
 ginger and white, grey and last       
 of all multi-coloured. The cats are   
 black and tabby.                      
 I have got 3 bantams, their names are 
 Betsy,Bert and Bunty.They are Pekings 
 and have feathers over their feet.They
 were show bantams, but as they are    
 tri_coloured they are no good for     
 showing anymore.Betsy is grey and     
 white,Bert is a black cockerel with   
 patches of shiny green,and Bunty is   
 black with bits of brown.They have    
 corn as their main food plus scraps   
 of leftover food.They live in a rabbit
 hutch with a metal run in front of it.</content>
