		<content> Many people visit this area during    
 late spring,summer &amp; autumn &amp; the     
 normally quiet country lanes may      
 become relatively busy.Elderly people 
 drive out to find a spot with a       
 beautiful view where they can doze in 
 the sunshine,knit or sit &amp; read.The   
 more energitic come to walk the moors 
 or to have a stroll by a reservoir.   
 The birdwatchers bring their          
 binoculars to try &amp; catch a glimpse of
 an unusual bird.The village of        
 Bradfield is a favourite place for a  
 days visit.When questioned,visitors   
 said they come mainly because of the  
 beautiful scenery &amp; for the quietness 
 &amp; peace away from the busy city.They  
 also like it because in a changing    
 world it remains the same &amp; unspoilt. 
 However quite a few admitted that they
 would like a teashop here where they  
 could find welcome refreshment.       </content>
