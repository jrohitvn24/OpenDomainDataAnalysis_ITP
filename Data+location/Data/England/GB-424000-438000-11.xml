		<content> In Cookridge there are activities like
 horse riding at Ling Bob Farm and     
 walking in the nearby countryside     
 where it is peaceful, quiet and a     
 pleasant change from the noisy city.  
 At Cookridge Village Hall there are   
 ballet, tap and modern dancing        
 lessons, slimnastics and a drama club 
 which puts on pantomimes and plays. In
 the summer holidays there is a        
 children's play scheme. At the        
 churches there are cub and brownie    
 packs where you can work for many     
 badges. There are play groups, youth  
 clubs and over sixties clubs. After   
 work some people like growing fresh   
 vegetables and flowers. They say it is
 very satisfying to have a neat and    
 tidy garden. We found that some people
 like making models and decorating. One
 dad had even made a boat in which he  
 can go sailing.                       </content>
