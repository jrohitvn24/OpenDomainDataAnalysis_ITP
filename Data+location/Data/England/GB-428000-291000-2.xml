		<content> With the closure of the two coalmines,
 many jobs in the area were lost. Many 
 men transferred to nearby coal mines. 
 In the area there are few             
 opportunities in industry             
 primary,secondary or tertiary. The    
 nearby town of Nuneaton,or the cities 
 of Coventry and Birmingham provide    
 many in the area with jobs.           
 Farming is the most important economic
 activity in the area,providing full   
 and part-time jobs. The main type of  
 farming is mixed farming,but with a   
 leaning towards livestock,with many of
 the crops used for fodder. The        
 following three pages have typical    
 examples of the types of farm in the  
 area.
