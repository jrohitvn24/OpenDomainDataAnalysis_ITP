		<title>18The Whispering Post</title>
		<content> The Whispering Post nowadays stands in
 a flower bed at Kings Hill, Rochford. 
 It's made of wood and stands five feet
 high. Its top is moulded and finishes 
 in a sharp pyramid and is supposed to 
 represent a candle.  The story behind 
 the post starts probably in Henry     
 III's time when the Lord of the Manor 
 was frequently away from home and was 
 hated by his tenants. One night when  
 the Lord returned home unexpectedly   
 he found his tenants "whispering" and 
 plotting to kill him. As a penance he 
 commanded them to assemble annually on
 the Wednesday after Michaelmas to do  
 homage for their lands in a whisper   
 and on bended knee. Anyone absent when
 his name was called had to pay a heavy
 fine. This tradition continued until  
 1892 but was revived by The Rochford  
 Hundred Historical Society who now    
 re-enact it annually at Rochford Hall.</content>
