		<content>{ Mrs S.Carroll}is the secretary of the
 Parent Teacher Association.When she   
 retires she wants to live in Spain and
 do nothing.She thinks children are    
 wonderful. She joined the PTA in      
 October 1981 Her ambition is to have  
 lots of money so she doesn't have to  
 work.She thinks the PTA work is quite 
 good but she doesn't like writing     
 things out. The PTA is a sort of club 
 for parents and teachers.They organize
 things like the Car Treasure Hunt and 
 raise money to buy things for the     
 school.{Mr D.Jones}is the new         
 headmaster. He likes his job here     
 because something different happens   
 every day.He came here because he only
 had 50 children at his last school in 
 Spalding.He has been teaching for     
 14yrs.He enjoyed his childhood until  
 he went to Grammar School.
