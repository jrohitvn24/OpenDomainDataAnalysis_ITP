		<title>15Robert Winters. Part Three.</title>
		<content>  Robert's brother Michael is a member 
 of the 3rd. Gainsborough Scouts and on
 the day that we visited he was at a   
 camp taking part in a cooking         
 competition.                          
  There are few children of Robert's   
 age in the village so he has to find  
 ways to amuse himself. He has built a 
 bicycle in his spare time and         
 sometimes goes for rides with his     
 mother. Robert is also a strong       
 swimmer but the nearest pool is in    
 Gainsborough. Robert enjoys reading   
 and he uses the library van that      
 visits the village every fortnight on 
 a Friday. Every Sunday Robert and his 
 brother go to Sunday School at the    
 Methodist Chapel in Heapham.
