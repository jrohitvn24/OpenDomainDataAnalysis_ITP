		<content> Gardening is the leading recreational 
 activity. Horse-riding is popular, and
 some paddocks are set out with jumps &amp;
 dressage equipment. The Crawley and   
 Horsham Hunt is well supported and is 
 on good terms with most farmers. The  
 nearest leisure centre and swimming   
 pool is in Horsham, but several homes 
 have their own swimming pools.        
  The nearest place of entertainment is
 the Arts Centre at Christ's Hospital, 
 to which there is no public transport.
 The new Arts Centre in Horsham is not 
 much better served, as the single bus 
 service is infrequent and there are no
 concessionary bus fares.              
    The area lies between the A.24 and 
 A.29 routes to the coast, so tourism  
 is of the 'passing through' variety. A
 few homes offer Bed and Breakfast. The
 number of ramblers and cyclists is    
 increasing, especially from Holland.  </content>
