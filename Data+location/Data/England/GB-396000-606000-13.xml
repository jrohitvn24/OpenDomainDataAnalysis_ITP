		<content> The old school which closed in 1965,  
 is now used as an Expedition Centre by
 Northumberland Education Committee.   
 Two nearby, adjoining old cottages    
 have  been converted into dormitories.
   The Centre is used during the week  
 mainly by schools (usually urban), and
 at the weekends by youth groups.Other 
 users are hospitals for the           
 handicapped, and sometimes by First   
 School groups.                        
    During July we often have youth    
 groups from Germany staying.These are 
 usually organised through the German  
 YMCA.                                 
    Every Tuesday evening there is a   
 local Youth Group meeting, run by Mr. 
 Johnny Common of Harbottle.           
   Sometimes at the weekends the       
 facilities of the First school are    
 used by the youth groups.
