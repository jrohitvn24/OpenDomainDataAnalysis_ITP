		<content>  {Communications}have been revolution-
 ised by developments in{electronics,  
 and nearly every household has{radio  
{and television}receivers. These have  
 broadened people's outlook but seems  
 to have reduced social contact.       
   Most households have their own{tele-
{phone.}There are only two public tele-
 phones in the whole area.             
   A good{postal service}exists. There 
 are a number of{post boxes}and every  
 household has at least one daily      
 delivery.                             
   There is one evening and three      
 weekly{local newspapers.}They are now 
 under commercial pressure from four or
 five recently established{advertising 
{broadsheets}that contain some local   
 news and are delivered free of charge 
 to some parts of the area.            
   A monthly{Parish Magazine}is widely 
 circulated.                           </content>
