		<title>02SOUTHERN SELSEY'S COASTLINE</title>
		<content>    Most of our coastal area is        
 protected by a newly completed        
{sea-wall}and many groynes are built   
 along the beaches.{West Beach}has flat
 stretches of sand and provides safe   
 swimming.{East Beach}is pebbly and    
 shelves down steeply into the sea.    
 Local people swim here.{Selsey Bill   
 separates East from West. Swimming is 
 dangerous here because of the Bill's  
 strong currents.There are many fishing
 boats,nets,lobster pots and huts along
 East Beach.Sub aqua divers,many from  
 London,come to East Beach to set off  
 to the{Mixon rocks}where they explore 
 a quarry about 28 metres deep.Water   
 skiing and wind surfing are seen along
 the coast. Houses have been lost into 
 the sea from both beaches but{erosion 
 has slowed since the sea-wall was     
 built,although very high tides still  
 cause damage.                         </content>
