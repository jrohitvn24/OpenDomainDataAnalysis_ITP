		<title>10A CHADDESLEY MARKET GARDEN</title>
		<content> Chaddesley Growers in Chaddesley      
 Corbett is the largest Market Garden  
 in the area. The land was separated   
 off from Lodge Farm 20 years ago when 
 4.9 hectares began to be used for the 
 production of tomatoes and soft fruit.
 Chaddesley Brook provided water for   
 irrigation and today this is supplied 
 from a bore hole and piped into the   
 ground where the soft fruit trees and 
 bushes grow."Pick your own" crops have
 been grown since 1977 when            
 strawberries raspberries and          
 gooseberries were and still are the   
 most popular. Conifers are grown for  
 direct sale to Nurseries and Garden   
 centres. Tomatoes, courgettes and     
 lettuces are grown in hot houses for  
 sale at the local market. The business
 is run by 3 people with some pickers  
 taken on in the summer. The rest of   
 the fruit is picked by the public.    </content>
