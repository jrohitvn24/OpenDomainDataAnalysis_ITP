		<title>20Farming Around Featherstone</title>
		<content> There are nine working farms in this  
 area most of them are owner-occupied. 
 Thirty years ago many were dairy farms
 but now only one of them has a small  
 dairy herd,the others are arable farms
 They grow cereal crops such as wheat, 
 spring and winter barley.They also    
 grow potatoes,a few peas which are    
 vined and frozen and oil seed rape    
 which has increased its acreage in    
 recent years.Most farms keep pigs and 
 cattle which they buy and fatten for  
 market at Barnsley and Doncaster.All  
 the farms rely heavily on machinery   
 and employ few workers,they are often 
 worked by fathers and their sons.The  
 size of the farms varies from 200-400 
 acres,some of the farmland being      
 rented from the NCB.The land is farmed
 intensively.the soil is fertile,and   
 well drained and gently sloping.
