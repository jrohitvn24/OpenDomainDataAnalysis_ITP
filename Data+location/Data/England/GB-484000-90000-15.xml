		<content>   One Monday morning in June between  
 9.24 and 9.54 we counted 95 vehicles  
 coming into ,and 139 leaving Selsey.  
 There are 29{bus journeys}to Selsey   
 and 28 to Chichester on weekdays,about
 one every half hour.It costs{Â£1.60    
{return}to Chichester from Selsey,     
 Â£1.10 single. In early May 1985,497   
 annual{bus passes,}costing Â£7 each,   
 were bought by Selsey pensioners. This
 allows them to travel on the bus half 
 price. The bus terminus for most      
 journeys is at the junction of        
 Hillfield Road and Seal Road but some 
 daytime journeys in the summer start  
 from West Sands Caravan Park.         
   There are still several{unmade      
{roads.}Each year a few more are       
 paved,and the residents have to       
 pay.The main street is being          
 resurfaced and levelled outside the   
 summer season.                        </content>
