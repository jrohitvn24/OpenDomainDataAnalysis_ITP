		<content> The villages of East Boldon and       
 Cleadon Village are surrounded by a   
 green belt area. Some of this land is 
 farmland. Two farms are owned by the  
 Church Commisioners. Mr.Sidney Gibson 
 is the tenant of both these farms, one
 of which is called Yellowleas. All the
 farms adopt mixed methods.            
 Yellowleas has 65 dairy cattle. Others
 keep beef cattle, pigs and chickens.  
 Barley, hay, turnips and cabbages are 
 also grown.                           
 The cattle are bought in at 5 months, 
 fattened and sold at 14 months. The   
 pigs are bought at 8 weeks and sold at
 4-6 months.                           
 The farmers' biggest problem is       
 preventing local people from stealing 
 their arable crops.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
