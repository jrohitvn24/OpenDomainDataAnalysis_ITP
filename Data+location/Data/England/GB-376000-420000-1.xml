		<content> Helmshore is a village in the         
 Rossendale valley. The M66 provides   
 access from Manchester and the M62.   
                                       
 Wildlife inherited Helmshore long ago.
 There is plenty of moorland for       
 rambling. The{Tor Mile}race is an     
 annual attraction. The top of the Tor 
 provides the best view of the         
 district.                             
                                       
 In 1789{Higher Mill}was built by the  
 Turner family. Today it is a museum   
 with a working water wheel. Much      
 farmland has been taken over by new   
 housing estates in recent years.      
                                       
 An indoor public swimming pool and a  
 modern{sports centre}cater for many   
 activities.These facilities are       
 much appreciated as it rains quite    
 often.                                </content>
