		<content>   In our D-Block area (Mordiford)     
 there was only one school, Mordiford  
 Primary. The School was established in
 the 1880's. It stands in three acres  
 of land and is staffed by it's        
 Headmaster Mr Maggs &amp; three other     
 teachers.                             
   The school at the moment has 56     
 pupils in the age range 5 to 11 but   
 the attendance is slowly declining    
 (although recently there have been no 
 school closures in the area).         
   The catchment area of the school    
 takes in Hampton Bishop, Dormington   
 &amp; Mordiford itself.                   
   The school holds a number of fetes, 
 fairs &amp; school plays to raise funds   
 for itself &amp; to provide entertainment 
 for the local community.              
   Most of the pupils when they leave  
 the school at the age of 11 go to     
 Bishop's, St. Mary's or Aylestone.    </content>
