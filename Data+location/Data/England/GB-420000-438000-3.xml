		<title>03Living in Rawdon</title>
		<content>  Most families have lived in the area 
 for 15 to 20 yearsand reasons for     
 moving here include being near work or
 relatives,or because they liked the   
 houses.The most common reason given   
 for liking Rawdon is that it provides 
 the{best of both worlds,}being quiet  
 and semi-rural with easy access to the
 motorways,Yorkshire Dales and the     
 amenities of Bradford and Leeds.Rawdon
 village is said to be clean and       
 tidy,retaining a{friendly small       
{community spirit,}though some complain
 of too much traffic travelling too    
 fast.Popular features are good        
 shops,schools and public              
 transport,country walks and good      
 facilities for children and the       
 elderly.It is regarded as a healthy   
 area with open fields and space and { 
{fresh air in abundance}.Many feel that
 more sports facilities are needed.    </content>
