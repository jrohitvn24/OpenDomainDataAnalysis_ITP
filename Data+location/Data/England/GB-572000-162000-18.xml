 To find the answer to this question we
 interviewed people at Weedswood and   
 Walderslade Village shops on 29 June  
 and 4 July.We went with a partner and 
 took it in turns to ask questions and 
 record the answers.Eight of us went to
 each place and we interviewed ten     
 people between the two of us.Each     
 group of eight interviewed 40,so alto-
 gether we asked 80 people questions.  
                                       
               _______                 
         Our first question was:
