		<title>01THE LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content> This is an area of flat open fields   
 interspersed with thick hedges and    
 small coppices.  The land is mostly   
 under 100 m above sea level and laid  
 mainly to crops.  The farms are large 
 and scattered.  The highest point is  
 the village of Takeley at 100 m.      
 Water supply is a problem and pressure
 has to be aided by water towers.  Most
 of the residential development has    
 taken place along the A120, a very    
 busy major road joining the A1 to the 
 A12.The area is well drained by small 
 streams which drain eastwards into the
 River Roding or westwards into Pincey 
 Brook.  At present this is a quiet    
 rural area designated as green belt.  
 Recently however, the government has  
 given nearby Stansted Airport the     
 go-ahead for expansion.  We are all   
 unsure of what the future now holds   
 for the village of Takeley.           </content>
