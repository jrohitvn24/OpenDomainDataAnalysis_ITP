  Essendon is a small village at the   
 top of a hill. Opposite the cricket   
 field on the High Road is a shop. It  
 sells groceries and has a post office.
 The telephone box is opposite the     
 police house at the top of School Lane
 _ our policeman looks after Newgate   
 Street and Essendon. We have a small  
 play park with swings and a slide next
 to the school. The cricket field is   
 used by the whole village. There are  
 many picturesque cottages with pretty 
 gardens in the summer. St Marys Church
 has an old cedar tree in the grounds. 
 The Church  is an interesting place to
 visit and there are many beautiful    
 walks in the area. There are 850      
 people on the electoral roll and 6o   
 children go to Essendon school. Most  
 people work outside the village.      </content>
