		<title>14Religion in Poringland</title>
		<content> Religion around Poringland consists of
 4 churches.All Saints Church,         
 Framingham Earl Church, Free          
 (Evangelical) Church, and a Methodist 
 Church.                               
 The first 2 date back to 1070 when    
 they were built on bones.The local    
 Reverend looks after both of these and
 conducts various activities within the
 church,womens groups, Brownies etc.The
 congregation for the church of England
 Services consists of about 50 people  
 but in the Free Churches it is only   
 about 10 or 15.No children attend the 
 Free Churches.                        
 Only the Framingham Earl Church has a 
 serviceable burial ground in use.     
 It is commonly believed by the locals 
 that a devil haunts the crossroads and
 a very strong vicar is needed to keep 
 away evil.
