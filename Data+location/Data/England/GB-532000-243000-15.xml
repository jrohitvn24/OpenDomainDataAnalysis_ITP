		<title>15BASSINGBOURN'S ROYAL EVENT</title>
		<content> The Hon. Oliver Walston came to see us
 and show some slides of Ethiopia. He  
 said that they were using roads that  
 would have been rivers.               
  We made a display for a Save the     
 Children exhibition in Cambridge which
 Princess Anne visited. The exhibition 
 was about having enough water to grow 
 the crops. We grew some wheat in poor 
 conditions then we grew some wheat in 
 the conditions here. We made a model  
 of a British farm and an Ethiopian    
 farm to show the difference.          
  When Julie and I were standing by our
 exhibit talking to Princess Anne all  
 these camera-men came up to ask us    
 questions. When Andrew and I went to  
 see Princess Anne I felt quite scared.
 When Princess Anne spoke to us she    
 said "Did you do Ethiopia as a whole  
 or as part?" I said "As a whole."
