		<title>02Villagers' ideas of Wroxall.</title>
		<content>  We wrote a questionaire to find out  
 about what people were interested in  
 Wroxall.We found out how long they    
 had lived here so that they knew      
 something about it.Most people like   
 Wroxall because of the wonderful      
 walks,the village,and the countryside.
  The things most people in Wroxall    
 find interesting are:- Appuldurcombe  
 House;village history; wild life and  
 birds.The things people dislike about 
 Wroxall are the dangerous roads and   
 poor public transport.                
  Some people are afraid the new houses
 will destroy the atmosphere of the    
 village,and become too big.           
  People play darts,swimming,tennis,and
 squash.In the evening people go to    
 friends' houses,to the Worsley and the
 Star Inn,and Wroxall Social Club.     
  People can play sports at Sandown,   
 Ventnor and Wroxall Community Centre. </content>
