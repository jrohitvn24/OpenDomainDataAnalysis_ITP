		<title>04Dairy Farming, World's End</title>
		<content> In our area there is one dairy farm   
 compared to 3 or 4 about 20 years ago.
 It has 3000 acres and both cows and   
 1000 pigs. There are about 110 cows to
 every 15 acres so it is intensively   
 farmed.                               
    Pastoral farming is cheaper than   
 arable farming and it is easy to      
 change from arable to pastoral so it  
 is likely that more farms will change 
 in the future.                        
    Many pieces of machinery are used  
 making life easier. Nowadays one      
 farmhand represents 4 or 5 only 25    
 years ago. Even so, unemployment is   
 very low compared to national figures.
    The M4 also helps farms in two     
 ways. It is easier to travel to market
 towns and has pushed the price of     
 surrounding land up a lot.
