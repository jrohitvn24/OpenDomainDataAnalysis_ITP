		<title>07Cornish Mine Stacks</title>
		<content> Cornwall is well known for its mine   
 stacks.Most of them were built in the 
 19th century and used until the       
 1890's.There are a lot of them around 
 the Carnkie and Carn Brea area.One of 
 the main ones is the Bassett Mine.Most
 of them were for steam engines.Not all
 of them have shafts as some were used 
 to power stamps.Stamps were used to   
 crush the rocks and release the tin   
 ore.One engine still in working order 
 is the East Pool and people on holiday
 can visit it.It is a beam winching    
 engine and was made at the Holman     
 Foundry near Camborne.Some engines had
 platforms on the beam which went right
 down the shaft and there were crevices
 in the shaft large enough for a man to
 stand in.He could ride all the way up 
 or down the shaft.Others had large    
 buckets on a rope to bring the rock   
 and ore to the surface.               </content>
