		<content> The Brighton and Hove Golf Club was   
 founded in 1887 and the old club house
{MAP REFERENCE 269092,}was built in    
 1890.It is still in use today.See also
 photograph.At the moment,there are    
 about 260 members who are mainly 40   
 years and older .There are only 9     
 holes on the course,but there are     
 different tees (starting places)so you
 can go round twice.The green fees are 
 Â£6 for 18 holes and Â£4 for 9 holes.For
 many years it was a club for gentlemen
 only but,in spite of some opposition, 
 lady players were admitted after the  
 1939 war.Nowadays ladies are allowed  
 to be full members.Although it has a  
 genteel and old world atmosphere, the 
 Club flourishes. Competitions and     
 social events are held and many       
 members attend the formal Sunday lunch
 which begins with Grace and ends with 
 the loyal toast- and{Port!            </content>
