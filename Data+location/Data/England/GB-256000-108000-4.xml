		<content> Members must wear a blue ribbon;      
 failure to do so means a fine of      
 sixpence (old money). The dinner is   
 followed by an afternoon of sports and
 a tea. In Iddesleigh there is a youth 
 club entitled 'The Christian Coffee   
 Bar' which is held in the village hall
 weekly, each Friday evening. It is    
 organised by members of the Methodist 
 Chapel for all young people over 11   
 years of age. Iddesleigh also has a   
 Womens' Institute which meets each    
 month in the village hall. Membership 
 is around 20. Dowland is joined with  
 the neighbouring large village of     
 Dolton to form the 'Dolton &amp; Dowland  
 WI' which meets once a month in the   
 village hall at Dolton; membership    
 being around 30 (approx 6 members     
 coming from Dowland).
