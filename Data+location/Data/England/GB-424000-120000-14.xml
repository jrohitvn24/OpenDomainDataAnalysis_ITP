		<title>14Whiteparish common</title>
		<content> Whiteparish common is an area of      
 woodland on the northern boundary of  
 our Domesday area.Many varieties of   
 insects and birds live there. On      
 Whiteparish common there are some rare
 butterflies ,one of these is the White
 admiral.The white admiral has got     
 spotted wings of white with bands of  
 white on them as well.Its wing span   
 is about 6 cm.The female is slighty   
 larger and it is a lighter colour.On  
 the fore wings there are three white  
 spots between the band of white ,and  
 the edges are fringed with black and  
 white.It hibernates inside a folded   
 honeysuckle leaf it is sucured to the 
 stem by silken threads.It looks rather
 like the Purple Emporer.The under side
 of the wings is very pretty.The egg is
 olive green in colour and it is in the
 shape of an orange.At the top of the  
 egg it is sort of flat.               </content>
