		<content>From the Kent &amp; Sussex Courier, 12th.  
July, 1985:                            
"The Horsmonden Gipsy Horse Fair which 
for the past two years has taken place 
in Paddock Wood may in future be at the
County Show Ground at Detling.  The    
Fair, which has been an annual event   
for about 200 years, is due to take    
place on September 8th.  So far, no    
definite venue has been fixed.  Mr. Tom
Lee, Welfare Officer of the Romany     
Guild who organises the Fair, wrote to 
local Councils asking for their        
co-operation in finding a permanent    
site.                                  
"We just want to find a home for the   
Horse Fair in the South of England,"   
Mr. Lee said.  "Some people want to go 
back to Horsmonden, the traditional    
home of the Horse Fair, but we want to 
avoid confrontation."
