		<title>04RELIGION IN BRAMHALL.</title>
		<content> I am 13 years old and I live in       
 Bramhall.   I do not have much to do  
 with religion except at school.       
 Three out of thirty children visit the
 church which is not many compared to  
 the number of churches in Bramhall.   
 This is mainly because people do not  
 have any time for God or religion,    
 also most people go to work; some can 
 not give up time to visit church. Also
 some people would not enjoy going as  
 they have never been to church and do 
 not know much about churches or God.  
 Near Parkside council estate there is 
 a church; the St.Vincent de Paul which
 is Roman Catholic; it has about 2,000 
 attending.  It is not very big, but   
 is very popular.  Once I went to it   
 and it was full of people standing up 
 and singing.                          
                                       
                                       </content>
