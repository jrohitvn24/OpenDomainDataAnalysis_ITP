		<title>20Wild Life around Braiseworth</title>
		<content>In our area there are quite a few      
rabbits which eat the crops,much to the
dislike of the farmers.Hedgehogs are   
very common near Green Farm,but it is  
sad to see so many squashed on the     
road.In the fields we can find mice and
voles. On the farms you can find wild  
cats which feed on the mice.When one   
group was out for a walk they spotted a
weasel. There are also stoats and moles
which can quite easily be seen from the
tracks.Our area is rural so there are  
plenty of wild mammals also there is a 
variety of birds especially birds of   
prey,that my class likes.Tamsin Pitt   
thinks fox-hunting is cruel because she
likes foxes,she saw one once on her way
home on a dark night,it ran across the 
road.
