		<content> To the East of the Region runs The    
 Kendal to Preston canal,a manmade     
 waterway 41.5 miles long.It's minimum 
 width is 42ft,minimum depth 6ft. and  
 it is lined with puddled clay 1-3ft.  
 thick.Meandering as it follows the    
 contours of the land,there are no     
 locks in this stretch,Built initially 
 for freight traffic in 1797 by the    
 Canal Company,taken over by the Land  
 N.W.Rail Co.in 1864 and Nationalised  
 by British Waterways in 1948,it is now
 used for recreational purposes.Small  
 boats,pleasure cruisers and fisherman 
 are regular users and the banks are a 
 haven for wildlife.The other main     
 waterway is the R.Cocker,a slow       
 running river in times of low rainfall
 in the Summer,it has been severely    
 affected by pollution killing off the 
 few Sea Trout which venture up. Many  
 Mallard duck &amp; sometimes Swans breed. </content>
