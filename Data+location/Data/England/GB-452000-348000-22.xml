<title>22Collecting for the 2011 Census</title>
<content>

In the Spring I worked several weeks as a Collector for the 2011 National Census. We are sworn to secrecy, so although there were some very amusing incidents, I cannot reveal specific details. The vast majority of people I met were polite and pleasant. In many instances, when people were aggressive towards me, it turned out they struggled to read or write. When I offered to work with them, they calmed down, and we completed the form together. I’d certainly do the job again in 10 years’ time.   &lt;br />
