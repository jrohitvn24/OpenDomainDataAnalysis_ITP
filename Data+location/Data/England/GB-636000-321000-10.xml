		<title>10THE PEOPLE</title>
		<content> Although our area is supposed to be   
 sparsely populated there still seems  
 to be a lot of people about. There are
 people of all ages; young, middle aged
 and the older generation. Some of the 
 older men can be seen on their bikes. 
 They probably had bikes when they were
 young and used to cycle about before  
 there were many cars. They wear black 
 jackets, flat caps and cycle clips.   
 There are lots of children about too. 
 Many young couples have moved out here
 because houses are cheaper and they've
 brought their children with them. Lots
 of people drive into Norwich or       
 Yarmouth to work. There are also lots 
 of people who have lived here for     
 years and years. Whether they are     
 locals or newcomers, the children and 
 adults of the area are very friendly.
