		<content> The river Duddon has salmon and we can
 swim in it.The school pond is right   
 outside the juniors window.It was dug 
 up by Ulpha school children in 1979   
 six years ago.It is thirteen metres   
 long.In the pond there are            
 tadpoles,nyphms,water snails and      
 caddis.We had frog spawn in our pond  
 on the 13th March.                    
     The reservoir near the Pike is 680
 feet up and it used to be used to top 
 up the water when the Bobbin Mill was 
 working.Now it has been dammed up and 
 people swim in it.
