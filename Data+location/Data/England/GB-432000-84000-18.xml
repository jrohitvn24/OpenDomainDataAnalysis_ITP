 On Friday I go to Drama Workshop at   
 Totland C.P. School.  At Dramaworkshop
 we try to improve our drama.  We do   
 improvisation when some of us get in a
 group and make up a play.  We don't   
 have any lines to say because in      
 improvisation we just make a plot on  
 what we are going to do and whose who 
 and then act it out while the others  
 watch.  The hard thing about          
 improvisation is that you have to make
 up the words and actions whilst you're
 doing it.  We also do two syllable    
 words when some of us get into a group
 and mime out the first syllable       
 andthen the second syllable and then  
 the whole word and the other have to  
 guess what the word is.               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
