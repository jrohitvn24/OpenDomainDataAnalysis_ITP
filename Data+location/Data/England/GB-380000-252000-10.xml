		<title>10FARMING-MIXED HUSBANDRY.</title>
		<content> Much of our land is farmland under    
 cultivation.One large area is         
 cultivated on a pick your own basis &amp; 
 grows strawberries,raspberries,       
 blackcurrants &amp; gooseberries.Other    
 farms have sheep &amp; cattle.As there is 
 a river,which floods,running through  
 the lower part of this area it        
 provides rich pasture land.The land is
 enclosed by hedges which contain many 
 trees including damson trees.         
 Cultivated land is used for silage,   
 hay,wheat &amp; barley.Usually there are  
 hop fields which supply the firm of   
 Guiness.There are a few orchards but  
 at one time there were far more but   
 these have made way for pasture and   
 housing.There is rough grazing for the
 sheep.Most farms do not have many     
 manual workers except on a seasonal   
 basis but even so farms are fairly    
 well mechanised.                      </content>
