		<content> The land around the Glinton area is   
 very flat and full of fields of       
 corn,sugarbeet,barley and wheat.The   
 soil is very good so most of these    
 crops are grown year after year.Years 
 ago at the time of the Ice Age all the
 area was covered with glaciers which  
 caused the land to be pushed further  
 and further downwards.This is why the 
 roads are higher than the actual      
 fields.Later when the Dutch had       
 discovered how to recover the land    
 from under water they came over to    
 this part of the world to recover the 
 area which was now all marsh and      
 bogs.This was done by digging dykes so
 that all the water would drain from   
 the land.Since then our soil has      
 always been moist and good for growing
 crops.
