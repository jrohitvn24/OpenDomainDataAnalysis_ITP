		<content>      Prior to l945 the Parish Council 
 had few functions.  More mechanised   
 post-war agriculture with less labour 
 caused some workers to move into urban
 areas.  Tenants became landowners and 
 these, plus the new incomers, tended  
 to change  the buildings, appearance  
 and needs of the area and to demand   
 more involvement in local government  
 at parish level, unlike urban areas.  
      This block is part of the        
 Llanwarne &amp; District Parish Council   
 (Llanwarne, Llandinabo, Pencoyd,      
 Harewood End and Tretire with         
 Michaelchurch), with l0 Councillors   
 and a Chairman elected annually.      
      Meetings are quarterly, with     
 Special Meetings when required.  The  
 public are invited to attend all      
 meetings &amp; have access to  accounts   
 etc. &amp; contact Council members to     
 discuss complaints or problems.       </content>
