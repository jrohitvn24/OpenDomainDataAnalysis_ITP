		<title>05My Family Weekend</title>
		<content> On Sunday I stop in bed a bit         
 longer.Sometimes I watch a film on    
 video. My mum gets up to make our     
 breakfast. We have bacon and eggs.    
 When I have finished I go to get      
 washed in the bathroom. After that I  
 go to call for my friend. We play on  
 the street. When my mum calls me we   
 go to my Grandma's. My cousin is there
 and I play with her. When we get home 
 my dad and I go for a run to the      
 field. I sit on the swings while he   
 runs round. When we get home we are   
 very tired. I have my dinner then.    
   After that I go and play out until  
 my mum calls me in to have my hair    
 washed in the bath. When I have done  
 that I watch television until I go to 
 bed.                                  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
