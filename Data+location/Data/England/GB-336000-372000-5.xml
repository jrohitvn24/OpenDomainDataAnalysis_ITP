		<content> The main farming enterprise in the    
 area is dairy farming.Land is medium  
 to heavy with a high water table.The  
 average size of field is eleven acres 
 and they are generally bounded by     
 hawthorn hedges.This makes a good     
 stock proof fence &amp; wind break.The    
 main crops grown are wheat,barley and 
 peas.The land is kept in good condiion
 by spreading manure on it in the      
 Winter &amp; nitrogen and potash in the   
 Spring.This produces good lush grass  
 for the cows to graze &amp; for making    
 into silage for the Winter.The 1980's 
 will be remembered by farmers as a    
 time when there was a surplus of all  
 products produced from the land.The   
 dairy farmers have had milk quotas put
 on them forcing them to cut milk      
 production figures by ten percent and 
 this has had quite a marked effect on 
 this area.                            </content>
