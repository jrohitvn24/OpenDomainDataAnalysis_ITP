		<content> The square is 2/3 covered by mainly   
 deciduous woods over undulating land  
 from 50-300ft. above sea-level. The   
 rest is farmed as pasture for sheep   
 and cows with some apple,pear and plum
 orchards.  The main area of population
 is in the NE corner, being ribbon     
 development along the A290, halfway   
 between Whitstable and Canterbury.    
 This is Honeyhill with a farm of the  
 same name, pub, nursery and shop,     
 tropical bird garden and houses.  The 
 other concentration of houses is part 
 of Dargate (NW corner) with 20 houses,
 transport depot, motor museum, pub and
 disused chapel.  Other habitations are
 mainly farms and cottages scattered on
 the road that runs SW to NE across the
 square. The majority of farmed land   
 follows this road. An area of the east
 Woodland is owned by the R.S.P.B. and 
 another by the Nature Conserv.Council.</content>
