		<title>05DALWOOD FAIR</title>
		<content> Dalwood has held a Fair for 640 years.
 King Edward 111 granted Dalwood a Fair
 Charter in 1345 and a copy of the     
 charter can still be seen in the      
 village church. The Fair is held  to  
 celebrate the Feast of St Peter and St
 Paul.The Fair was important to the    
 village because they could buy and    
 sell their produce. All of the money  
 went to the Lord of the Manor. The    
 Fair is now held in August for one    
 week. It begins with a procession.    
 There are stalls, amusements,         
 handicrafts and teas in the village   
 hall provided by the W.I ,the W.I also
 serve the teas.The money made at the  
 fair now is shared between the school 
 the village hall and all of the other 
 clubs and associations in Dalwood.    
 Other than the procession on the first
 day there are things like Morris      
 Dancing and sometimes a play.         </content>
