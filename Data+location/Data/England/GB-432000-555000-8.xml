		<title>08INDUSTRY IN HYLTON</title>
		<content> Historically the main industries in   
 South Hylton were shipbuilding,       
 pottery and the coal trade. All of    
 these are now finished and employment 
 in the area is concentrated on purpose
 built industrial estates.             
 At Pennywell there are 7 companies    
 which employ a total of 1587 workers  
 Echo-newspapers;Bard-pharmaceuticals; 
 Scotkem-chemicals;Dunlop-piping;Ideal 
 Windows;Power Steering-car steering;  
 Dewhirst-clothing.                    
 There are also factory and workshop   
 sites at Pattinson North and South in 
 Washington which employ over 400      
 people in service industries such as  
 car valeting and in secondary         
 industries such as food, clothing,    
 fire safety and signs.                
 Despite these estates there is a      
 shortage of jobs in the area.
