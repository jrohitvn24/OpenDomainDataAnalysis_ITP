		<content> In my opinion, the best place for     
 ice-skating is Oxford Ice Rink. There 
 are two other local rinks near my     
 home, Queensway in London and         
 Richmond. When you watch ice-skating  
 on television or at a rink, it looks  
 terribly hard. You cannot believe that
 these people are moving around at such
 speed just on thin pieces of metal.   
 Almost every time someone starts on   
 ice they are guaranteed to fall over, 
 either on their back or on their      
 front. After a terrifying tour of the 
 rink clinging to the side barriers    
 with white knuckles, you find that you
 can stand up without holding onto the 
 side; only to be knocked over by some 
 flashy skater. After only a few trips,
 you will find that even you can       
 withstand the 'speeders'. Don't forget
 to wear gloves, and be prepared for a 
 wet and cold backside and aching feet.</content>
