		<title>09Living in a village.</title>
		<content> Living in a village is much more fun  
 than living in a town .Towns are busy 
 with cars  and a smell of car fumes   
 everywhere .Villages  are very pretty 
 and there is fresh air everywhere you 
 go .It is peaceful in a village and   
 there is not many cars.               
 Schools in some villages are quite big
 but some schools are very small.Our   
 village is the prettiest village in   
 Essex.                                
  I like living in a village .I would  
 never like to live in a town. Towns   
 are more convenient for shopping. In  
 the countryside you can go for walks  
 and look at the lovely scenery .When I
 am not at school I go jogging round   
 the playingfield with my next door    
 neighbour .I hope I never move to     
 a town.
