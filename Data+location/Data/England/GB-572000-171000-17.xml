		<title>17MARKET GARDENING</title>
		<content> fields is sandy,light and chalky and  
 very good for this type of farming.   
 Crops include brassica, potatoes,     
 onions, carrots and lettuce. Last year
 the potato crop was not very good     
 because of the dry weather. This year 
 plastic sheeting was used to cover the
 crops to get them ready for the early 
 markets. The grain is stored in silos 
 but the market garden crops are sent  
 straight to the markets.              
   Mr Ballard says that farming is more
 a way of life then a job. He works    
 five and a half days a week, ten hours
 a day all the year round except during
 the harvest when he works from dawn   
 till dusk. He normally starts work at 
 7 am. but has to be up by 5.30 am.    
 when lettuces have to be cut.         
  In the future much more use will be  
 made of plastic sheeting and field    
 irrigation will be essential.         </content>
