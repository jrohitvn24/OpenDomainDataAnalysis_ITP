		<title>08HISTORIC BUILDINGS IN RIPON</title>
		<content> RIPON CATHEDRAL cont...               
 Archbishop Roger of York is the main  
 architect of the present building,the 
 west front is the work of Walter De   
 Gray                                  
  The south east corner of the central 
 tower collapsed about 1450 and left it
 unusable for some years.The choir     
 stalls were finished in 1494.Compared 
 with many Cathedrals,Ripon is very    
 light and spacious due to the         
 rebuilding of the nave in 1500 A.D.   
                                       
 THE HOUSE OF CORRECTION,              
 This building was a prison and is now 
 used as a prison museum showing all   
 the old torture instruments and the   
 methods of punishment that the        
 Victorians used,such as the"treadmill"
 and the"crank".
