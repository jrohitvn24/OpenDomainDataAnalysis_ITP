		<title>05LOCAL GOVERNMENT, KETTLEWELL</title>
		<content>   Kettlewell has a Parish Council with
 an elected chairman and secretary.    
 All those on the electoral roll of the
 village are entitled to attend and    
 vote.  Those owning holiday cottages  
 are welcome to attend but may not     
 vote.                                 
    The Council discusses and makes    
 decisions on matters of village       
 concern and interest.  Major decisions
 are taken by Craven District Council, 
 the Yorkshire Dales National Park     
 (especially on planning matters) and  
 North Yorkshire County Council.       
   For many years the area has been in 
 a parliamentary constituency which has
 returned a Conservative Member of     
 Parliament.  The Division is now      
 called Skipton and Ripon.
