     The people who have got tickets   
 for the  Library  can  have as many   
 books as they like.There is a fabulous
 range of books. There are also{large  
{print books}to help people who cannot 
 see very well.                        
                                       
     The County Council also provides a
{mobile clinic}which comes around every
 third Monday of the month. It stays   
 for about one hour so that all the    
 mothers can take their children that  
 are under five years of age.          
     There is also a{health visitor}and
 a{nurse.}They see the children and    
 give advice to their mothers.They     
 weigh the babies and give them tests  
 and  also injections if necessary.
