		<title>12Farming B: Land Use</title>
		<content>  Much of the land is used for the     
 grazing of sheep and cattle and the   
 rest of the grass is used for hay,    
 silage or haylage, being cut either   
 two or three times a year.            
                                       
  Some farmers plough a few of their   
 fields and plant cereals such as      
 barley, oats and wheat. Swedes are    
 also grown as a cash crop on certain  
 farms.                                
                                       
  Most residents and landowners use    
 part of their land as kitchen gardens 
 providing themselves with and all year
 round supply of vegetables such as    
 potatoes, leaf greens, broad and      
 runner beans, peas and root crops as  
 well as a variety of soft fruits.     
                                       
  Apple trees grow well and most farms 
 have their own small orchards.        </content>
