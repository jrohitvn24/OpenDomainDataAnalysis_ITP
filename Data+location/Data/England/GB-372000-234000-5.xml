		<title>05The Farming Scene.</title>
		<content> The area comprises of agricultural    
 farmland, rough grazing, woodland and 
 a small acreage used for horticulture.
 There are two large estates which are 
 broken into smaller farms, some       
 organised from the estate offices and 
 some let to tenant farmers. There are 
 several Fresian milking herds varying 
 in size from 50-500 cows. Herds of    
 Herefords and Charolais cattle are    
 kept for beef. There are several large
 flocks of sheep, breeds include:- Blue
 Leicester/Swaydell cross, Suffolk and 
 Welsh Mountain, these are kept on the 
 higher ground. Crops grown include    
 oats, barley, wheat, potatoes, peas,  
 maize and grass for silage and hay.   
 The main changes people have noticed  
 include reduction in labour because of
 improved and larger machinery, removal
 of hedges and ditches and the         
 increasing use of irrigation.         </content>
