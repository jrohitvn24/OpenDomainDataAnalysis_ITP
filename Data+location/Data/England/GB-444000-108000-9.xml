		<title>09Going to games on the Bus.</title>
		<content>   Our school has got a very small     
 school field and so for our Middle    
 School games lessons we go by bus to  
 Weston Lane Playing Field which is    
 about a mile away.                    
   The older children go together      
 (about 70 children) on a Thursday     
 afternoon for an hour and the younger 
 children go on a Tuesday.             
   We go on a{Double Decker bus}which  
 waits for us by the school gate.The   
 bus has got about 75 seats so there is
 plenty of room for us all.We go       
 upstairs on the way to the field and  
 downstairs on the way back.I like it  
 up stairs best because you can see    
 all around.                           
   We have to take all our own sports  
 equipment with us and in our different
 groups we have a chance of learning   
 all sorts of games-football,hockey,   
 rugby,netball,rounders,tennis,cricket.</content>
