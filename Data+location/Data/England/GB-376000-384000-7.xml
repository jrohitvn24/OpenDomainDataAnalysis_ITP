		<title>07SHOPPING IN HALE.</title>
		<content>   A Survey team were  responsible for 
 counting the amenities in Hale; they  
 counted an interesting variety of     
 shops, especially high class grocers, 
 clothing boutiques and furnishings.   
 They were, however, surprised when    
 they asked shoppers what they thought 
 of this busy shopping street,{Ashley  
{Road.}People were pleased with the    
 variety but visited Altrincham for    
 lower prices. Despite the numerous    
 banks people wanted a{Post Office.}The
 residents were pleased with the lack  
 of "fast" food shops, even            
 restaurants, which they thought may   
 harm the area. Transport, however, was
 seen as a major problem, Hale is a    
 busy area but has only one Zebra      
 Crossing. Car parking facilities and  
 bus services are inadequate. Shoppers 
 need help without ruining the         
 residential character of the area.    </content>
