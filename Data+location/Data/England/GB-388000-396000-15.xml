		<title>15A Fairfield Playground Game</title>
		<content> In the school playground we play a    
 game called Kingy.As many people as   
 you like can play,you also need a     
 ball.You stand in a circle with your  
 legs about half a metre apart and wait
 for the person who is king to drop the
 ball into the centre of the circle.   
 When the king has dropped the ball    
 into the centre of the circle you wait
 and see which legs the ball rolls     
 through.If the ball goes out of the   
 circle you say,"broken window."You do 
 this until the ball goes through      
 somebodys legs.When the ball has      
 rolled through somebody's legs that   
 person is on.The person who is on     
 chases the other people with the ball 
 and tries to hit them with the ball   
 (not too hard).If the person hits     
 somebody with the ball then that      
 person is on.                         
                                       </content>
