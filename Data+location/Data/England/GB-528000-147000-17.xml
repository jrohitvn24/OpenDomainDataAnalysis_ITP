		<title>17  THE ROYAL PHILANTHROPIC</title>
		<content>    The{Philanthropic School}is where  
 boys go if their parent/s are in      
 trouble with the law,or,if the boy    
 himself is in trouble.When it first   
 started the Philanthropic was very    
 big,but now it's only half the        
 size.The foundation stone on the      
 chapel was laid by{Prince Albert}in   
 the mid nineteenth century.           
   Most of the boys stay for two to    
 three years.They live in dormitories, 
 fifteen boys in each house.           
    It is really like a boarding school
 because they do school work like us.  
 They also play sports,go canoeing in  
 Merstham and Cornwall and play golf   
 with{Mr.Henry},one of the staff.      
    The staff try very hard to make    
 sure that the boys feel at home and   
 try to give them all the things they  
 miss in their own homes.
