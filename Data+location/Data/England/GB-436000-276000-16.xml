		<content>   {BULLDOG} is a very exciting game.  
 One person is "on" and they shout a   
 name and you have to run over a line. 
 If you don't get caught everyone else 
 has to try. If you do get caught you  
 are "on" and have to say "Bulldog,    
 bulldog,1,2,3, caught,caught,caught." 
   {MARBLES}is a simple game. It is    
 played with stones or small glass     
 'balls' called 'marbles'. All you have
 to do is to try and hit your opponents
 marble to win. You can also play by   
 trying to get your marbles into a     
 hole. You have to be good at aiming.
