		<title>18NEW ENGLAND FARM</title>
		<content> Situated in the Southern region of our
 area is New England Farm. The farm has
 an attractive setting of grassland and
 trees around it. It used to be        
 connected physically to New England   
 Stud but now a road separates the two.
 This farm is unusual in our area in   
 that it has live stock. It caters for 
 race horses and at the present time   
 has only four. It can have a lot more 
 as there are twenty eight stables. The
 horses go to the farm as a resting    
 place to get over an injury or        
 illness. One we saw had a back injury 
 and was able to have a whole field to 
 its self. The farm also is a place    
 where horses which have just flown in 
 from abroad are able to unwind and    
 there are large barns for this        
 purpose. Some workmen were demolishing
 some old sheds to make way for new    
 stables.                              </content>
