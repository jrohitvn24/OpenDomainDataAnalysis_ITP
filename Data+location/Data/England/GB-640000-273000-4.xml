A Bronze Age ring has been identified  
on former heathland and there is much  
scttered evidence of Roman occupation, 
particularly along the south facing    
slopes of the Bramfield Brook. The     
remains include pottery, glass, coins  
and tiles which suggest a settlement   
site.                                  
Consensus agrees that the name         
Wenhaston is derived from Wenheards    
Farm. Few old buildings in village, or 
in Bramfield or Thorington. Very little
earlier than 16th C.. Rose Glen and the
Guildhall Cottages in Wenhaston date   
from mid 15th C. A number of barns also
date from this period -e.g. at Church  
Farm Thorington.
