		<content> Aust has two churches. Aust Church is 
 at the west end of the village. It is 
 situated on elevated ground with views
 of most of the village. Most of the   
 Church dates from the fourteenth and  
 fifteenth centuries. Gravestones      
 surround the building and writing on a
 number over two hundered years old is 
 still distinguishable. there is a     
 communal grave where victims of ferry 
 boat disasters are buried. The Church 
 has a number of particularly          
 interesting features including : a    
 medieval Font; a nave containing      
 fourteen corbel heads and a stone     
 pulpit erected in the sixteenth       
 century with symbols of the           
 Evangelists. Towards the east end of  
 the village is an Evangelical church.
