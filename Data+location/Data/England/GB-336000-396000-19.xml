		<title>19LIFE ON A KIDNEY MACHINE</title>
		<content>   My mum had kidney failure in 1975   
 and for the last ten years has been   
 kept alive with a{kidney machine}and  
 an artificial kidney device.          
                                       
   An artificial kidney filters        
 impurities from her blood and also    
 draws fluid from her blood.           
                                       
   Three times a week she has to insert
 needles into her veins on her left arm
 which are then connected by long blood
 lines to the artificial kidney. For   
 six hours her blood circulates through
 the artificial kidney via the arterial
 blood line and is then pumped back    
 into her body via the veins blood     
 line.
