		<content>  WINTERBORNE WHITECHURCH -MILTON      
 ABBAS. The area covered by the survey 
 includes only two villages. Milton    
 Abbas, the model village of the eight-
 eenth century, is the younger. The    
 then owner of Milton Abbey, Joseph    
 Damer Earl of Dorchester, decided that
 the village which surrounded the Abbey
 was too near so he built the present  
 village and cleared the old leaving   
 but one cottage still in use by the   
 Public School housed in the Earl's old
 home. The Benedictine Abbey was       
 founded in the 10th Century.          
 Winterborne Whitechurch is clearly    
 identified in Domesday Book as land   
 owned by Milton Abbey. La Lee Farm,   
 situated above the School, takes its  
 name from Winterburn La Lee noted in  
 early 13th century titles. Winterborne
 Whitechurch has a population of 650.
