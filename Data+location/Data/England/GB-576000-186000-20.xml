		<content> Anglo_Saxon Chronicle records victory 
 of King Alfred's troops at SB over    
 Danes in AD 894. Haesten's campsite   
 is now car park.A wooden church was   
 probably built as thanksgiving. A     
 Norman church was later built, a      
 beautiful wooden porch added in 15th  
 century and chancel built in          
 perpendicular style. List of vicars   
 goes back to 1189. SB  is mentioned in
 Domesday 1o86 when church and manor   
 were transferred from Barking to      
 Westminster Abbey. To this day,the    
 Vicar does annual duty at Westminster.
 A smaller manor belonging to Saxon    
 Alwin ran from Thundersley slopes to  
 creek inlet at Hopes Green.{
