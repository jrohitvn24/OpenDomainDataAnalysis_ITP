		<content> There are three main landscape        
 elements in the block:                
 The well dissected dip-slope of the   
 Chalk is at its highest in the        
 north-east at about 90m.O.D.and slopes
 down to the south-west,reaching 35m.at
 the junction with the Tertiary rocks. 
 These Lower Tertiary rocks are mainly 
 clays and produce a broad vale        
 draining west towards the R.Itchen    
 valley.The lowest ground in the block 
 is found on this western edge at 25m. 
 In the extreme south-west the land    
 rises to 60m.representing the scarp   
 face produced by the Bagshot Beds of  
 the Tertiary.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
