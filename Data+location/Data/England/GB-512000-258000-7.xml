		<content> Odell Great Wood, is designated by the
 Nature Conservancy Council as a site  
 of Special Scientific Interest. It is 
 a large (85.1 hectares) and mostly    
 unspoilt example of wet Ash-Maple     
 Woodland with an exceptionally rich   
 flora. It is in many respects the best
 example in Bedfordshire of this type  
 of woodland, which has become         
 increasingly scarce throughout        
 southern and eastern England. The     
 dominant tree species are Ash and Oak 
 over a well-developed shrub layer of  
 Hazel, Field Maple, Dogwood and       
 Privet. There are several rare flowers
 to be found in the Wood such as Wild  
 Daffodil and Herb Paris. The extensive
 and well-developed system of rides is 
 another important feature, adding to  
 the value of the site for flowering   
 plants, butterflies and other         
 invertebrates.                        </content>
