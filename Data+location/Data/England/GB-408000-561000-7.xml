		<title>07PRUDHOE POLICE FORCE</title>
		<content> In Prudhoe Police Station there are   
 16 men in uniform, 4 sergeants, 1     
 detective sergeant and 2 detectives.  
 Prudhoe does not have any dogs or     
 horses as it is not big enough, but   
 when they are needed they are brought 
 from other stations.                  
   It has one cell and one interview   
 room. The most common crimes in       
 Prudhoe are car theft and burglaries. 
 Last year 1675 children were knocked  
 over within the Prudhoe area. Tragic  
 events include an old lady who was    
 killed at Kiln Pit Hill, a man who was
 killed after a fight in Prudhoe and a 
 boy who was killed in a road accident 
 on Prudhoe Front Street.
