		<content> The Old School at Copt Oak is used as 
 a YHA Hostel because all children     
 attend schools elsewhere.There are no 
 adult education classes at present    
 previously they were held at Copt Oak 
 Hall.The area receives TV well,Ceefax/
 Oracle are available.                 
 The mobile library calls fortnightly. 
 General Pamphlets are published by    
 Leics CC also detailed notes on       
 walks.Many other books about Charnwood
 Forest include this district.Most are 
 obtainable from the library on loan or
 for purchase.                         
 There is no industry or trade many of 
 the residents are retired couples or  
 widows.Those still in gainful         
 employment are employers or employees 
 elsewhere or locally providing        
 domestic help or work connected with  
 the land.
