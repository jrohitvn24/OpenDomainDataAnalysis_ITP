{'out of church'}life of the people.   
 There are{housegroups}which are for   
 adults who meet in each others homes  
 to learn about Jesus and to get to    
 know people.   There are 12 leaders   
 for 6 groups.                         
 There are about 60 people who attend  
 these housegroups.                    
 There are activities and groups for   
 young people also.  They are called   
{'Focus', 'Scramblers', 'climbers',

{'mountaineers'.  }There are about 60
