		<title>01Richmond-First Impressions</title>
		<content>  I have been at Richmond for about 4  
 months now and I think it is really   
 boring.I used to live in Yarm.I wish I
 still was! One place that is better is
 the swimming pool.Richmond Baths is   
 the best I have been to except for    
 Sunderland.                           
  We moved to Richmond because my dad  
 wanted to be nearer his work. Dad and 
 Mum think Richmond is better than Yarm
  Richmond shops are not as good as    
 those in Yarm.                        
  When I am older and at Richmond      
 School my sister said I will do a     
 topic on Richmond so I might get to   
 find out a lot more about the place   
 and begin to like it better.
