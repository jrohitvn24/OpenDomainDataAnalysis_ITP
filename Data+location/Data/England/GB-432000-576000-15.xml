		<content>      William Carr was born on April   
 23rd 1756 at Hartley Old Engine, and  
 in his prime was reputed to be the    
 strongest man in the world. At the age
 of 17 he weighed 18 stones and stood  
 6ft 3in. He could lift a 700lb weight 
 and throw a 60lb weight a distance of 
 24ft. By the age of 30 he had grown to
 6ft 4in and weighed 24 stones.        
      Carr followed his father into the
 blacksmith trade, and, whilst         
 repairing an enging at Hartley, he    
 once worked for 6 days and 5 nights   
 with no sleep, then for a further 5   
 days and nights after some sleep.
