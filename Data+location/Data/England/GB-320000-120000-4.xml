		<content> This is a broad{lowland}area          
 rising to the Blackdown Hills to the  
 south. The area surrounding Trull and 
 Staplehay is mainly agricultural,     
 consisting of fields ranging from 30  
 to  approximately 4 acres. These are  
 enclosed  by{hedgerows,}a natural     
 habitat for wildlife and plants;thus  
 making the area attractive. There are 
 plenty of{trees,}mainly deciduous, so 
 that the rolling landscape in summer  
 is a rich mixture of green and brown. 
  The only feature to disturb this     
 rural landscape is the M5 motorway,   
 which can occasionally be heard and   
 seen!Elsewhere there are few signs of 
 urban development since most of the   
{settlement}consists of isolated farms 
 and occasional villages such as Trull 
 and Staplehay.
