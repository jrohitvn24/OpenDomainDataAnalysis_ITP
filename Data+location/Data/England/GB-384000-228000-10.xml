		<content> The Barlows moved from Stourport to   
 Apperley about 10 years ago basically 
 because Mr Barlow had found a better  
 job in Gloucester. They also wanted to
 live in the quiet countryside and the 
 house, formerly the Apperley village  
 primary school, was in the right place
 and in the right price range. There   
 are many disadvantages as well as     
 advantages about living in Apperley.  
 There is a good bus service, tennis   
 courts, an excellent Primary school   
 and three churches. There is also     
 a shop but sometimes the produce is   
 expensive. Except for younger         
 children,there is little entertainment
 in Apperley which is a great pity     
 because the village has great         
 potential. Even the new Village Hall  
 may not suitable for the community    
 which designed it. A car and money to 
 facilitate escape is vital for sanity.</content>
