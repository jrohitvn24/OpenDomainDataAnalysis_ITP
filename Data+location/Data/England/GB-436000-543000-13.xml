		<title>13*MART DAY IN THE VILLAGE**</title>
		<content> One Saturday six children went to the 
 mart to do a questionnaire for the    
 Domesday Project.We found out that the
 mart started over 100 years ago and   
 sold only large and small             
 livestock.Farmers came in their pony  
 traps and carts. The boys used to hold
 the horses for a penny.The mart is now
 so popular that it is open twice a    
 month.Now it sells many things.Some of
 them are poultry, goats, bikes,       
 household things and logs.People came 
 from long distances and local         
 places.On the day of our survey the   
 longest distance was from             
 Darlington.We noticed that young      
 people were not as interested in      
 answering our questions as the older  
 ones.The people over 50 helped a      
 lot.On mart Saturdays there were cars 
 everywhere.At other times the mart    
 square is quiet.                      </content>
