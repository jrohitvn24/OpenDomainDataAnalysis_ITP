		<title>16CARLTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
 Carlton is quite a small village, but 
 one in which the church, chapel, local
 shops and village school are still in 
 use.                                  
 We have a large playing field with    
 five swings on it, and quite a large  
 field for football.On one side of the 
 playing field is a huge 2OO year-old  
 oak tree, which is great for climbing.
 On the playing field Ithink that we   
 shouuld have more swings, or a        
 climbing frame at least.The roundabout
 that we had was old and falling apart.
 The council took it away to mend and  
 paint it last summer and we haven't   
 had it back yet!They keep on saying   
 that they will give us a "Jungle Jim" 
 a kind of climbing frame....I'll      
 believe it when I see it!
