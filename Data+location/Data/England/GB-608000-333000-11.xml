		<title>11THE VILLAGE HALL, EDGEFIELD</title>
		<content> The village hall is very important in 
 Edgefield's social life. It is well   
 situated on the edge of the village   
 green and on the main Holt-Norwich    
 road. The hall committee whose main   
 object is to raise money for the      
 extension and upkeep of the hall      
 (Â£4000 raised from this small         
 community in two years) also organises
 annual events such as a summer fete, a
 harvest supper, and a Christmas party 
 for the over 60s.                     
 The Tuesday club with about 30 members
 organises events throughout the year. 
 Church members provide a branch ofthe 
 Mothers' Union and a Sunday School on 
 Tuesdays in termtime.                 
 There is Bingo every Thursday, and a  
 Youth Club.
