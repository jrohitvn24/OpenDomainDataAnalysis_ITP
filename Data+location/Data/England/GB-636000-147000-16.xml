		<content> The landscape of the block is         
 downland with maritime associations.  
                                       
 The eastern 6sq.km is sea backed by a 
 low shingle beach and low chalk cliffs
 angling away NNW from the shore  to   
 show where the sea once reached .Cliff
 heights are about 60 metres in the    
 south of the block dropping away      
 completely in three kilometres.       
 Kingsdown village ,the major          
 development sprawls down a fold in    
 the downland which breaks through the 
 cliffs and leads to the shore.Behind  
 the beach,higher downland rolls down  
 to the sea with folds or valleys      
 leading roughly in a SW_NE direction. 
 Heights in the SW corner of the block 
 are approximately 65 metres falling   
 away  with increasing closeness to the
 sea.
