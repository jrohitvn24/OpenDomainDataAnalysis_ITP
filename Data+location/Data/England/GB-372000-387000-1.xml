		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF AREA</title>
		<content> Dunham Massey is a predominantly rural
 area close to Altrincham, on the      
 Southern Edge of Greater              
 Manchester.The area is made up of     
 small villages and hamlets, farms and 
 a suburban part of Altrincham,but the 
 whole area is dominated by Dunham     
 Massey Hall and Park.                 
  The Hall dates from the early        
 eighteenth century and was taken over 
 by the National Trust in 1976.The     
 parkland area has a large herd of deer
 and is also used for leisure          
 activities from jogging to riding.Each
 year the Hall presents an Edwardian   
 Extravaganza.                         
  We have concentrated our information 
 on the hall and park, but have also   
 looked at types of housing and the    
 lives of some of the residents in the 
 area ranging from a school pupil to a 
 deerkeeper and a farmer.              </content>
