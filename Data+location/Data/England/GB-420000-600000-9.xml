		<title>09Acklington Prisons</title>
		<content> Since 1972,{two prisons}have been     
 taking shape in Northumberland. They  
 are called Acklington and Castington  
 and stand on the site of the old      
 R.A.F.station less than 2km south of  
 Acklington Village. You can still see 
 one of the large hangars which has    
 been retained and converted into      
 workshops.                            
{Acklington,}at present, holds 460 men 
 and is described as a training prison 
 with an emphasis on industrial        
 training and education. A proportion  
 of the inmates are serving life       
 sentences. The number of staff is 250.
{Castington}Prison holds about 200     
 young offenders (aged 17-20) and these
 inmates are considered to be more of a
 security risk than those at Acklington
 Prison. The staff at Castington number
 about 130.                            
 Both prisons are still growing.       </content>
