     Junior church is fun. One night   
we played pass the banana.             
    Junior church is on Tuesday. You   
don't have to pay but some people      
do,I dont. My sister is a monitor      
she hands out the hymn books,lights    
the candles and reads stories to the   
young ones.                            
                                       
    Sunday School is held in Somerby   
methodist chapel.                      
    A few weeks ago we were practicing 
for the Anniversary. Some grown ups    
were watching us, we sang "Silver and  
gold Ihave none" and "Bind us together 
lord".
