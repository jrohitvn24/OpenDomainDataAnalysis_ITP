		<content> The Festival of Eid is celebrated by  
 the Moslems at the end of Ramadan.    
 Ramadan being the time of the year    
 when Moslems fast between the hours of
 dawn and dusk, for a total of 40 days.
  Food and drink is only allowed during
 the hours of darkness and this may    
 mean eating in the middle of the      
 night. This does not apply to very    
 young children. This fast ends with   
 the sighting of the new moon, and this
 signals the beginning of celebrations.
 The festival of Eid usually lasts for 
 2 days and is a time of religious and 
 other celebrations. Eid begins with   
 the Moslems attending the mosque for a
 prayer meeting. People are dressed in 
 their new clothes, especially the     
 children.  After the religious events 
 it is then time for parties, visiting 
 friends and relatives and the giving  
 of presents.                          </content>
