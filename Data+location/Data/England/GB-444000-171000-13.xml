		<title>13CATTLE</title>
		<content> The only livestock on the smaller     
 farm is a herd of 120 cattle which are
 kept on the 50 acres of clay soil     
 which is too heavy and wet for        
 ploughing.The calves are bought at    
 twelve weeks old and are kept for 18  
 months thus being sold for beef the   
 next Chistmas in the year following,  
 via the agency which arranged their   
 purchase.Their winter feed is         
 concentrates plus barley off the farm 
 and silage made on the farm by a firm 
 of contractors. They are kept in      
 shelters with concrete floors and with
 feeding mangers along the sides.In the
 summer they are given feed extra to   
 the grazing.The breeds in this year   
 are Friesian X Hereford,Limousin,and  
 Simmertal fairly new to Britain.Red   
 tags on their ears denote heifers and 
 blue tags for bullocks.
