		<title>13A New Chapel</title>
		<content> An exciting event occurred in the     
 village last year when a modern       
 extension to the Methodist Chapel was 
 opened.A great deal of hard work had  
 gone into the raising of the Â£90,000  
 for the overall building but it has   
 all been worthwhile.                  
  The Chapel is used daily as a Family 
 Centre and it is utilised, not only by
 parents and children from the village 
 but by mothers and children who stay  
 overnight at the Wesley Hostel when   
 visiting the prison.                  
  The Centre is also used four mornings
 a week by the local Playgroup. The    
 number of children attending Sunday   
 School is increasing and the Chapel   
 held its Sunday School Anniversary    
 again this year.                      
  A few weeks ago two bus loads of     
 parents and children went to Newquay  
 on the Annual Sunday School outing.   </content>
