		<title>06BUILDINGS at Blindcrake</title>
		<content>   During 1985 (and previous years)    
 change has come to the village with   
 the modernisation of the vernacular   
 stone built cottages,farms and barns, 
 the majority built in the period 1620 
 to 1780.                              
   Under the watchful eye of the Lake  
 District Special Planning Board       
 approval has been given for conver-   
 sion, extension and building using    
 local traditional materials.          
   This year saw a Public Enquiry over 
 planning permission for two of the few
 remaining possible building sites in  
 the village. One was rejected, the    
 other has many conditions attached if 
 buiding is to take place.             
   1985 also saw the village enter the 
 "Best kept small village" competition,
 We came second.                       
   The Ghyll Yeat pub has possibly the 
 smallest bar in England-one tiny room!</content>
