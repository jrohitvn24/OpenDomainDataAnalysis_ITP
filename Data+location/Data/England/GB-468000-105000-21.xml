<content>

In Laura Ashley it is extremely expensive. The old Tesco opened in 1997 and was rebuilt and a new Tesco opened in 2010 at Christmas! Opposite Tesco there is retail park consisting of 7 shops they are Hobbycraft, pets at home, Laura Ashley, next, Halfords, sports direct and peacocks. There is a restaurant next to all those shops called pizza hut and another small restaurant called burger king and it opened about four years ago, and pizza hut opened about 3 years ago.&lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
