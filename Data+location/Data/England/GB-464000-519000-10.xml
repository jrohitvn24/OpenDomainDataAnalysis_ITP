		<title>10SALTBURN STATION DEVELOPMENT</title>
		<content> Saltburn's railway station has always 
 been a central feature of the town and
 a major factor of its attractiveness. 
 The station development began in 1982 
 and will be completed this year. The  
 excursion platform to Brotton and     
 Whitby and the Zetland Hotel platform 
 had both been closed by 1970 and had  
 become derelict. Land was bought      
 by different groups of people and the 
 site of the old platforms became a    
 large supermarket and job centre the  
 community needed. Old waiting rooms,  
 toilets and ticket office were        
 converted into shops which are now    
 ready for occupation. The station     
 front has been cleaned up and new     
 buildings kept to their architectural 
 style. The land adjoining the Zetland 
 Hotel, once old stables, has been     
 turned into flats to complete this new
 phase of development.(F.Duff.)        </content>
