		<content> The New Town has developed a new area 
 for employment in the west of the     
 block at Winwick Quay.This area was   
 probably chosen because of its close  
 proximity to the motorway network, but
 the area has a wide range of available
 workers of all ages and abilities     
 which suit the recruitment needs of   
 many different firms.In the new       
 development area,off Winwick Road,    
 factory and warehouse space is        
 provided,and the businesses range from
 printing to leisure(slot machines) and
 from wines to computers.Next to the   
 new area in Winwick Road is the much  
 older Fiat complex.Here there is      
 storage space for thousands of cars,  
 but these areas are no longer in use  
 for storage as the base is now used as
 the main Fiat parts depot in the U.K.
