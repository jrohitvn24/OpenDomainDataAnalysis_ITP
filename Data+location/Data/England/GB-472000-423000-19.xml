		<content>  We all eat very well and have both   
 quantity, quality  and a good variety 
 of{food}in comparison with many people
 both in Britain and the world.        
  The{types}of food and pattern of     
 meals we eat in our house obviously   
{change}with the seasons and during    
 weekends and holidays.                
  My family eats at least 2 salads a   
 week during the summer and vegetables 
 about 3 times a week. We eat chips on 
 average about twice a week. People    
 should eat a{balanced diet}to keep    
 healthy.                              
  We don't eat many{foreign}dishes,    
 apart from curry with rice unless we  
 go abroad.  Goole doesn't really have 
 it's own{traditional}dish but         
 Yorkshire Pudding and fish and chips  
 are both eaten quite often.           
  Mum prepares the food and does most  
 of the{cooking}but sometimes I help.  </content>
