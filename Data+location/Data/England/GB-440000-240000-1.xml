		<title>01Rural area on edge of town.</title>
		<content>The area covered by this block is      
mainly rural with much of the the land 
under cereal crop cultivation. On the  
Eastern edge is the Bretch Hill estate 
of Banbury which was built for London  
and Birmingham overspill housing. As   
the estate has stablised so the social 
problems of single parent families,    
unemployment, and crime, particularly  
vandalism, have grown.                 
In the area is the small hamlet of     
Drayton and the picturesque village of 
Wroxton with its pond and Abbey. The   
Abbey is now part of an American       
University. From the dovecote in the   
Abbey grounds start two circular walks 
through this typical North Oxfordshire 
countryside. There is little employment
in the area apart from the odd shop,   
farm, school or public house. People   
travel to Banbury for work, shopping   
and leisure activities.                </content>
