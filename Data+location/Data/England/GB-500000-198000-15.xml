		<title>15HOLY CROSS CHURCH (SARRATT).</title>
		<content> The present church was built in 1190. 
 There may have been an earlier        
 building on this site,but no-one knows
 for sure. The original building has   
 been restored several times,the most  
 extensive being in the 19th.Century.  
 Like many old buildings in Downland   
 areas,flint is used as a major        
 building material.                    
 Stain glass windows form a dramatic   
 part of the church structure.There are
 windows depicting the Crucifiction and
 Ascension.                            
 In oldest headstones in the churchyard
 are those of the inhabitants of Rose  
 Hall Farm and Goldington's,which are  
 up to 700 years old.This is because   
 they were the only ones wealthy enough
 to be able to afford them.During the  
 restoration work of 1860,a Norman     
 coffin lid was discovered.This is now 
 preserved inside the church.          </content>
