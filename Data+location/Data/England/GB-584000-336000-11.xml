		<title>11POPULATION, NORTH CREAKE</title>
		<content> The population of N Creake is about   
 355.  The numbers have risen in recent
 years, as elderly people have retired 
 to the area, and cottages once lived  
 in by agricultural workers have been  
 converted into holiday homes.         
 At the first census in 1801, the      
 returns showed that there were 405    
 inhabitants; the figures rose to their
 peak of 659 in 1871; falling to 518 in
 1901.                                 
 The village primary school closed in  
 the mid 1970's, for lack of numbers.  
 The majority of the state pensioners  
 draw their money from the local sub   
 post office; with a few having it paid
 into their bank accounts.             
 None of the usual professions are to  
 be found in the village, except for   
 the Priest-in-Charge, whose residence 
 is the vicarage of the village of     
 South Creake.                         </content>
