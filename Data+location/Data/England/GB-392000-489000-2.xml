		<content> One of the most significant features  
 of the landscape of the area is the   
 terracing of the hills due to what has
 become known as "The Yoredale Series".
 This is the name given to a series of 
 rock strata layered in a regular      
 pattern - sandstone, shale, limestone 
 - the irregular erosion of which has  
 formed steps down which flow many     
 waterfalls.                           
 The Dale was formed by the action of  
 glaciers moving to the east. The      
 drumlins left by this action are      
 another major feature and the Roman   
 Camp (Virosidum), east of Bainbridge  
 was established on a large drumlin.   
                                       
 The major human feature of the        
 landscape is the network of dry-stone 
 walls and the buildings, both         
 constructed utilising local limestone 
 and sandstone.                        </content>
