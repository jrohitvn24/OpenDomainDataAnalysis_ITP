		<title>03LIVING IN N.SCARLE PLOTS</title>
		<content>  I like living in the plots of North  
 Scarle because it is very quiet and   
 not many people disturb you when you  
 are playing.There are no thugs at all.
 There are no vandals or thieves.There 
 are qiute a lot of rubbish dumps where
 you can search for old toys.There     
 are quite a lot of B.M.X.tracks.There 
 are not as many in the town.You would 
 have to go to  five shops to get five 
 things in a town and in a village you 
 can go to one shop to get five things.
 Sometimes the people from the         
 town come to the countryside for      
 a change of scenery because they      
 have not got any beast,sheep or       
 wildlife in the city.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
