The area covered varies from the       
medieval ruins of Lesnes Abbey and the 
fossil beds of Lesnes Woods in the     
East to the urban Victorian terraces   
and sixties tower blocks of Plumstead  
in the West; from the marshland and    
the newtown of Thamesmead at present   
under construction bordering the river 
Thames to to the north to the suburban 
residential area in the south.         
                                       
The area has been predominantly        
residential from the turn of the       
century with the building of the Abbey 
Wood Estate (in the fifties) and       
Thamesmead (begun in the sixties) as   
advances in building technology made   
possible building on the marshland to  
the North.
