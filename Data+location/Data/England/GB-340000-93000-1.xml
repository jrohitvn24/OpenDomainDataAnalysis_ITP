		<content>    This South Western part of Dorset  
 lies within a designated "Area of     
 outstanding natural beauty." From     
 rounded hills rising to 200 metres    
 enfolding green valleys the views     
 are spectacular.                      
    The population is sparse and       
 scattered but in summer there are     
 holiday visitors either staying within
 the area or passing through along the 
 A.35 which cuts across the South West 
 corner en route to Devon and Cornwall.
 Moreover many retired persons have in 
 recent years, been attracted to the   
 area to live there permanently.       
    Apart from the A.35 road,          
 communications in the district are    
 notoriously difficult. The few roads  
 are narrow and winding having steep   
 hedges at either side.Overall it is a 
 hilly pastoral scene with relatively  
 mild climate and increasing notoriety.</content>
