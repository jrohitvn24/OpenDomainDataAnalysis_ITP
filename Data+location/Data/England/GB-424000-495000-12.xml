{Weddings.}It is the custom for        
 children to tie up the church gates   
 when a couple have been married.When  
 coins are thrown over the gates they  
 are untied.                           
{Mischief Night.}Each year on the 4th  
 November it is the custom for local   
 children and youths to get up to      
 pranks in the village.It is quite     
 common for garden gates to be removed.
