		<title>04A JUNIOR SCHOOL HEADTEACHER</title>
		<content> We interviewed the headteacher of our 
 school.                               
 Our school has been open for about    
 ten years ,and Mr.Lord the headteacher
 has been here since then.             
 He said that he thought our school was
 better off than most,but he could not 
{buy as much equipment}now as he could 
{ten years ago.                        
 Mr.Lord finds the job demanding and   
 satisfying.(He also is responsible for
 the cleaning and cooking staff as well
 as the teachers.)He is responsible for
 the school accounts and money.        
 Mr.Lord lives in{Desborough}and comes 
 by car to school everyday.He used to  
 live on the estate ,but moved of it   
 when he bought his own house about    
 nine years ago.                       
 In his spare time he enjoys playing   
 golf when he can.He is also very keen 
 on photography.                       </content>
