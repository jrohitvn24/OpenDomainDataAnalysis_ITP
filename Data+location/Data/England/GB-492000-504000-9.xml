		<content> SHEEP. The different breeds of sheep  
 around here are:  Swaledale, Suffolk, 
 Masham and Jacob.                     
 You would usually find Swaledales on  
 the moor because they are a hardy     
 breed. You would not find many old    
 sheep there because they lose their   
 teeth and cannot eat heather. The     
 farmer then brings them inside and    
 feeds them on rolled barley and       
 concentrate pellets or sends them to  
 be slaughtered.                       
 Jacobs are black and white. They are  
 kept for the wool used in knitting.   
 They have two pairs of horns, a long  
 and a short pair.                     
 Suffolks have a black face and legs.  
 They are kept in fields where the     
 farmers can see them because they are 
 not very tough and need to be cared   
 for and fed in winter.
