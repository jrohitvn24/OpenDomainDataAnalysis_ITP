		<content>   The gravel pits in two of our       
 squares are not shown on the map but  
 there is evidence of use because we   
 saw some trucks and there was gravel  
 all over the area.There was a old     
 disused gravel pit filled with water. 
   We discovered a working quarry      
 belonging to Hall Aggregates. We      
 interviewed one of the employees and  
 we found out that they employed twelve
 men who extracted gravel from a two   
 hundred acre site for the building    
 industry.                             
   There is a Civil Engineering Company
 in our area,called Fawley Engineering.
 The building,built in the Second World
 War,as a RAF Radio Station.It later   
 became a primary school and was taken 
 over by Fawley Engineering in 1980.
