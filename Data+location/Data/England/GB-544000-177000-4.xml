		<content>The game I play with my brother is     
FOOTSTEPS.This is the way to play.One  
person stands against the wall with his
hands on his eyes,the other people     
stand about 5m away.The wall person    
says "footsteps footsteps 1,2,3," and  
in that time the people on the line    
run up to him without him seeing.If    
the wall person sees someone move as   
he turns round they have to go back to 
the beginning.If someone gets to the   
wall person without getting seen       
they stand against the wall and the    
game starts again.      KERRY AGE 11   
                                       
To play STUCK IN THE MUD the person    
who is 'he' has to touch someone.They  
have to stand with their arms up.To    
get them free other people have to go  
under their arms.When they have all    
been touched the last one to get       
touched is 'he'.        GEORGINA AGE 11</content>
