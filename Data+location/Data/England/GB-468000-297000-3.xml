		<content> The majority of houses are built in   
 red brick.  There are old cottages    
 dating back 150 years or more, but    
 also a small number of houses built in
 the last 25 years.  There are a few   
 houses and flats built by the council.
 The latter to house single and elderly
 people.  The majority of the houses   
 are owner occupied, not rented.  The  
 oldest house in the village itself is 
 the Manor House which is still a      
 residence, a local doctor lives       
 there..
