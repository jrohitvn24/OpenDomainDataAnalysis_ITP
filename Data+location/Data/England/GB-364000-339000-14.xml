		<title>14THE NORTH SHROPSHIRE HUNT</title>
		<content>                                       
 The Shropshire Hunt starts at Mrs     
 Roycrofts'farm at Park Farm.It comes  
 to Adderley in March and November.It  
 mostly goes down to our house (Lane   
 Farm) they go to the Conker wood.They 
 always have a drink of Sherry before  
 galloping off. Sometimes the hunt     
 damages a newly sown field,they       
 flatten corn ripening too. The North  
 Shropshire hunt is alright but the    
 horses make a mess. I like the hunt.  
 When the hunt returns they have a bit 
 of lunch.When the hunt is in full     
 flight I watch them over the hedge,but
 when they start going towards Adderley
 I go in.There are approximately 16 to 
 18 horses in the hunt and about 20    
 dogs in all. But I like watching the  
 huntmen galloping away in their bright
 red coats and shiny black boots.
