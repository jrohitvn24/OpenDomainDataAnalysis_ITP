		<title>15Fruit Farm - Costs &amp; Grants</title>
		<content>      The complexity of building grant 
 forms and the time taken to consider  
 them deter many from even applying.   
      In dry years irrigation  is      
 necessary, not only toensure that     
 fruit reaches the E.E.C. minimum size 
 but also to prevent Cox,in particular,
 from splitting.  Over the last two    
 very dry years irrigation of l        
 inch/month has been carried out       
 through a metered supply.  In l984    
 over half-million gallons was put     
 on the trees, costing Â£l.25 per l,000 
 gallons.                              
      A local beekeeper keeps 6 hives  
 in the orchard all year ensuring      
 pollination and the honey is sold     
 through the farm shop.  Customers for 
 the shop come from Swansea to         
 Manchester, but mostly from the       
 Welsh valleys, loyally returning each 
 year since l970.                      </content>
