		<content> It is privately owned but in need of  
 restoration. Behind it is an ancient  
 earthwork which is a good example of a
 Motte and Bailey defence work.        
 Tothill's church has been removed, but
 the cemetery and old rectory remain,  
 the latter is now a family home.      
 Gayton Top now has a pheasant farm. A 
 most important new feature in the     
 village of Withern is a new surgery   
 built next to the school and partly   
 equipped by funds raised by local     
 people and children. There is special 
 emphasis placed on the health and     
 welfare of the local children.
