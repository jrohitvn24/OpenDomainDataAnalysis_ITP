		<title>16INDUSTRY IN GOXHILL.</title>
		<content> Apart from the small amount of        
 industry based at Goxhill Airfield    
 there are only three other sites of   
 industry in the area.                 
 Abbey Windows specialise in double    
 glazing and glass products. Their site
 next to the railway station has       
 expanded with a large workforce in    
 recent years.                         
 Barrick's Transport is on the southern
 side of the village. About 170 men are
 employed driving articulated lorries, 
 tankers and tipper lorries. Barrick's 
 operate nationally and are also one of
 the village coal merchants.           
 Thompson Industries is a small        
 business which produces specialised   
 coach-building for commercial         
 vehicles. Each winter a fairground    
 "Galloping Horses" roundabout and     
 Gavioli organ is refurbished and      
 stored on the premises.               </content>
