		<title>16ICKFORD CHURCH</title>
		<content> Ickford church makes me feel a little 
 bit creepy inside for some reason.    
 It is quite dark inside the church.   
 When I first walk in to the church the
 first things I see are all the        
 colourful things like the flowers and 
 windows.The candle holders in the     
 church always look nice and shiny.    
 The church is very cold.It looks very 
 old.Some of it dates from Norman      
 times.Parts of the church have been   
 added on since then.The pillars have  
 got all different patterns around     
 them.On one of the window ledges there
 is a game called Nine men morris which
 the choirboys used to play.There are  
 three doors leading outside.There is a
 font near the door which babies get   
 christened in.
