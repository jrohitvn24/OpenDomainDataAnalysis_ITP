		<content>   There are two bus companies         
 operating in the area. The main       
 company is The LIncolnshire Roadcar   
 Service. They operate many services in
 the county. Our area lies on the      
 Lincoln to Newark route and so        
 services between the two towns is     
 fairly regular. They also operate a   
 service that just comes to Hykeham,   
 although it does not go round the     
 village.                              
   The other company that serves our   
 area is The Silver Dawn Company.  They
 operate a service that runs from Brant
 Road (Lincoln) to the Birchwood       
 Housing Estate (Lincoln). The service 
 comes along the road from Waddington  
 across the bridge and then along      
 Chapel Lane onto Lincoln Road.  The   
 services are quite cheap (30p to      
 Lincoln) but they only run at the rate
 of one an hour.                       </content>
