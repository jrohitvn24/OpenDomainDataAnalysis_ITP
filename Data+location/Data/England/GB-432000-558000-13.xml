 In June 1984, Sunderland Airport      
 closed.  The airfield was handed over 
 to Nissan for the development of its  
 car plant.  So ended sixty years of   
 Sunderland's association with flying. 
 The airfield appeared during the      
 1914-18 war, but was not really       
 developed until 1930 when it became an
 R.A.F.Auxiliary Aerodrome, housing 607
 City of Durham Squadron.  The outbreak
 of World War Two heralded the most    
 important period in its history.      
 After its first 'kill' when three     
 Gladiators shot down a Dornier Flying 
 Boat, in December 1939, it served with
 distinction throughout  the Battle of 
 Britain, protecting Sunderland in the 
 famous daylight raid of August 15th   
 1949.  In 1963 the Corporation took it
 over and it became a Civil Airport    
 until its closure last year.          </content>
