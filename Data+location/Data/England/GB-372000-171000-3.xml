		<content>    There are no schools in the area   
 covered, the nearest being a{Primary  
 school in Marshfield, 2 miles away and
{Comprehensives}at Sir Bernard Lovell, 
 Oldland and Kingsfield, Warmley,  5   
 miles distant, for which school buses 
 are provided. A service bus runs to   
 Bath where there are several          
 comprehensives and private schools.   
{Pre-school}children can attend a      
 Mothers and Toddlers Group, for under 
 3s,or a playgroup at Marshfield.      
 These are voluntary groups paid for by
 parents. A few children go to private 
 boarding school.                      
   {Adult Education}is provided by the 
 Workers Education Association in      
 Marshfield and by colleges in Bath and
 Kingswood. A mobile Library visits    
 fortnightly. The families in the area 
 seem satisfied with these facilities.
