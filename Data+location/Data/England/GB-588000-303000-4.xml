		<title>04ASHILL VILLAGE SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Amidst an atmosphere of{industrial    
{action}over teachers pay, a stubborn  
 government attaching many conditions  
 to their so called reasonable offer,  
 and an increasing need for{teacher    
{accountability}from all sectors; life 
 in our village school must continue.  
 Teaching in buildings over 100 years  
 old, coping with inadequate toilets   
 that freeze during the winter and     
 making do in{temporary classrooms,    
 paints a poor picture. However 100    
 pupils aged 5 to 11 enjoy education   
 offered by a{head and 3 assistant     
{teachers.}The quality of learning, the
 experience of life and the excellent  
 relationships that develop far        
 outweigh disadvantages created by     
 education in a small, outdated rural  
 school. Plans include remodelling of  
 buildings and a new hall in the near  
 future, hopefully 1986.               </content>
