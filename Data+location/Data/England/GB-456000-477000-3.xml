		<title>03Ampleforth Village.</title>
		<content>  Ampleforth's attractive appearance   
 is derived from the small stone and   
 pantile cottages and houses fronting  
 the village street. Towards the centre
 of the village the street is flanked  
 by wide verges on which trees have    
 been planted.                         
  The village is the largest in the    
 south western area of the National    
 Park. Since it is also in the proposed
 Howardian Hills area of natural beauty
 there are planning controls on the    
 freedom of people to put up new       
 buildings or extend existing ones.    
  Another problem which affects the    
 village is the increase in Holiday    
 cottages. Local people believe that   
 these add little to the Economic or   
 Community life of the village, and    
 help to inflate house prices making it
 difficult for local young people to   
 settle in the area.                   </content>
