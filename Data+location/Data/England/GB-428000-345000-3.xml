		<title>03Turnditch Hedges + Fields</title>
		<content>      The pattern of the fields locally
 shows  that  they have been  used  for
 grazing  and  cultivation  over a very
 long  period of time. I have completed
 a survey of four hedgerows near to the
 school. Three  could well be over  200
 years old while the fourth is probably
 over 400 years old.I think  that  this
 last hedge was probably part of a wood
 once as there are  bluebells  and fern
 growing in the bottom of the hedgerow.
      I have identified these trees and
 shrubs in the hedgerows; {            
{ash, birch, blackthorn, buckthorn,crab
{apple, elder,elm,hawthorn,hazel,holly,
{lime, poplar, rose  and  sycamore.    
     The  predominant tree and shrub is
 the hawthorn. Most of the  hedges have
 been layered (pleached) at some stage.
 Only  in a  very  few  cases  has  the
 hedgerow  been  replaced  by  fencing.
