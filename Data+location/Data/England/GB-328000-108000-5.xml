		<title>05Road Traffic in Chard</title>
		<content> Road traffic is generally light       
 compared with major towns but Chard   
 suffers from periodic congestion due  
 to the seasonal influx of{tourists    
 during the summer months .            
 Cars and caravans  leaving the{M5}and 
 making for the{W.Dorset and E.Devon   
 resorts cause major jams where the    
{A358}crosses the{A30 .                
 Attempts to solve this condition have 
 led to the designation of relief      
 roads, notably Crowshute link to the  
 N.W. This allows traffic to pass West 
 from the{A358}to the{A30}with minimum 
 delay.                                
 However,attempts to route traffic     
 from{A30}to{A358}North of Chard have  
 run into opposition from residents of 
 roads such as Helliers Rd which has   
 turned from a quiet cul de sac into a 
 busy thoroughfare in less than 15     
 years.                                </content>
