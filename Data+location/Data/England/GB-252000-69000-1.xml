		<title>01WALKHAMPTON &amp; DISTRICT</title>
		<content>  This area consists of one big        
 Dartmoor tor (Sharpitor) and the      
 valley of a Dartmoor river (the       
 Walkham) On the western edge of the   
 block, between the tor and the bottom 
 of the valley, is the only settlement 
 - Walkhampton.                        
  We surveyed the ecology of the high  
 moorland, aspects of Walkhampton,     
 (children's thoughts, education,      
 transport, village centre buildings). 
  We also looked briefly at local      
 history and the general landscape and 
 we tried to find out how people made  
 their living and what sort of lives   
 they led in the area.                 
  Plymouth is (June 1985) still a big  
 military town, so we looked at what   
 effect the armed srvices have on the  
 area.
