		<content> Most of the local stories concern Loe 
 pool and Loe bar.                     
 It is said that Sir Bedivere cast     
 King Arthurs sword Excalibur into Loe 
 pool.                                 
 Loe Bar was supposed to have been     
 formed by the Cornish giant Jan       
 Tregeagle.While collecting shingle in 
 his leather apron some slipped out and
 fell into the mouth of the River      
 Cober.                                
 Every seven years Loe Pool is said to 
 claim a life.                         
 About thirty years ago two planes     
 collided over Loe Pool.One landed in  
 the marshes,the other sank in Loe     
 Pool and was never recovered because  
 the pool is so deep.                  
 In 1841 a large Frog fish was found in
 the pool.It had been thrown in by the 
 sea, probably during a storm.Inside   
 its stomach were 18 trout and 2 eels. </content>
