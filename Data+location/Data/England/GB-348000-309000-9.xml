		<title>09ANIMAL LIFE</title>
		<content> The most often seen animals in peoples
 gardens are hedgehogs and squirrels.  
 Hedgehogs often nest in gardens,{12% }
 of people having them live there.     
 The other animals that have been seen 
 are weasels, rats, shrews, toads, bats
 lizards, foxes, squirrels, mice, water
 voles and frogs. Foxes are seen quite 
 often nowadays, which surprised us. We
 were also surprised that there are no 
 rabbits. Only hedgehogs are fed by    
 people but we found that{9%}fed them, 
 more than we expected. When we asked  
 if people took in a sick or injured   
 animal more than half of the people   
 said they did. Although we live       
 near the countryside when we asked,   
 "Do you agree with fox hunting?"{79%  
 of people said they didn't agree,{12% 
 said yes, {4%}didn't reply            
 and {1%}didn't mind. Obviously a lot  
 of people think fox hunting is cruel. </content>
