		<title>16MY SUMMER HOLIDAY</title>
		<content> On Sunday my family and I went to     
 Billing Aquadrome. Billing Aquadrome  
 is a caravan site with a mini         
 fairground.It takes about half an hour
 to get there.We met our grandad there 
 so he could give us a card to get in  
 free.My sister and I decided to go to 
 the arcade to spend 50p on Invaders   
 and Pinball.I saved 15p to buy a      
 doughnut at the shop next door.I took 
 Â£9.00 with me,so did my sister.We     
 spent about 50p there because it was  
 quite boring going on the same        
 machines every time because most of   
 them were shut down.After that we went
 back to the caravan and dad,my sister 
 and I went to a few lakes.There are   
 quite a lot of fish there.You are not 
 allowed to fish in some bits of the   
 lakes.                                
                                       
                                       </content>
