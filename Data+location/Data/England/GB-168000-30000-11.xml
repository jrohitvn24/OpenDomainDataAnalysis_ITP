		<title>11Recreation: Children's Games</title>
		<content>      We have three classes in our     
 school and we decided to do a survey  
 to find out which games children in   
 each class liked playing.             
      The Infant girls like playing    
 Mummies and Daddies best of all, also 
 coloured eggs, horses and wishes.     
 They like to change games every week. 
 The boys liked games like running,    
 catch and cops &amp; robbers.             
      The girls in Class 2 like 40-40, 
 a sort of hide and seek game; horses  
 and It.  The boys like running, scraps
 and racing.  They all seem to stick to
 their own best game.                  
      The girls in Class 1 like        
 Bull-Dog best, where one goes into the
 middle and tries to catch the other   
 people.  When all have been caught,   
 the first one caught goes into the    
 middle.  The boys like scraps!
