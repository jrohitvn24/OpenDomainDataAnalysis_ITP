		<content> During the last ten years many retired
 people have moved to Witheridge ,     
 mainly to cheap bungalows.The result  
 is a larger than usual percentage of  
 elderly people to the rest of the     
 population.This has made problems for 
 the local doctor and the health       
 service who find it difficult to cope.
 In Devon , Witheridge is second only  
 to Torquay with such a high proportion
 of elderly people.                    
    The building of new estates has    
 caused a severe overloading of the    
 sewerage system.The sewers are very   
 old and in poor condition and after   
 heavy rainfall or a period of drought 
 they block very easily and overflow.  
 There have been public meetings       
 involving planning authorities and    
 health officials , but because of the 
 lack of money very little has been    
 down.                                 </content>
