		<content> A bus is a vehicle which carries fare 
 paying passengers to varying          
 destinations.  The{SYPTE (South       
{Yorkshire Passenger Transport         
{Executive)}and{Yorkshire Traction     
 operate in the Warmsworth area        
 employing approximately 829 people.   
 Yorkshire Traction operate a two shift
 day and SYPTE a three shift day.  Both
 companies have low fares.  SYPTE has  
 half its fares paid from the rates.   
 Yorkshire Traction keeps low fares by 
 less staff and fewer buses.  The buses
 are used for about three years, at    
 present costing Â£7 000 to replace.    
 The companies have nine and six       
 garages respectively.  Of the         
 companies Yorkshire Traction has the  
 only self service machines.  SYPTE's  
 new vehicles carry 82 people, and     
 Yorkshire Traction's 80 passengers.
