		<title>14River Mole near Fetcham.</title>
		<content>       The River Mole starts at Gatwick
 Airport.From Gatwick it flows to      
 Molesey and into the Thames.In our    
 block the river has lots of meanders  
 and flows North-West.There are three  
 weirs which changes the level of the  
 water.Trees grow near the river       
 because of the rich,moist soil. There 
 are three tributaries in our block.One
 leads to Pachesham Lake.              
    There are some buildings near the  
 river like the Sewage Farm,Slyfield   
 House,Brook Willow Farm. Most         
 residential areas are away from the   
 river because of flooding risks. The  
 river passes under the M_25 motorway  
 three times in our block. There is one
 bridge and two culverts.              
    The river is most enjoyable and is 
 used for leisure. Children and adults 
 fish, swim and canoe there.
