		<content>     There was once a country nursing  
 home for crippled children .It was    
 opened in{1913}but is now run by      
{Stockport Area Health Authority.}It is
 a family support unit, and provides   
 places for children who are both      
{mentally and physically handicapped.  
     It does not have wards but is made
 up of self-contained units or homes,  
 having a lounge, dining area, kitchen,
 bedrooms and bathroom to make the     
 children feel 'at home'.              
     Half the places are taken up by   
 children who{live a Treetops}and the  
 rest provide care for children who    
{live at home.}Children with very      
 special needs come here whilst parents
 have a well earned holiday.           
     Children who attend Treetops are  
 all from the{Stockport area.}Their    
 needs and rights are the same as all  
 other childrens.                      </content>
