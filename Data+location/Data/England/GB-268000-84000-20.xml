		<title>20RECREATION (ii)</title>
		<content> Of the quieter recreations, gardening 
 seems to be the most popular, the     
 emphasis being mainly on vegetables   
 and self sufficiency.Walking is       
 popular with retired people, there    
 being an abundance of footpath and    
 outstanding scenery. Many people list 
 reading as a recreation and use the   
 Chagford library and the mobile       
 library from Okehampton.There are     
 several musicians in the area, a      
 flautist at Lower Hurston and at      
 Batworthy Mill a guitarist and        
 harmonica player who performs with a  
 local band "Tickle Pink" and another  
 young guitarist at Lingcombe. Several 
 people play the piano, at Buda, Torr  
 Cottage, Torr House and Beetor.       
 Snooker is played at Beetor Farm. Wine
 making is also on the list of hobbies.
