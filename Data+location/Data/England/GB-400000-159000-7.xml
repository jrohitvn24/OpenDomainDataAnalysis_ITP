		<title>07THE DEVIZES MOONRAKERS.</title>
		<content> The most famous of Wiltshire tales    
 is about the smugglers of Bishops     
 Cannings.                             
 One gloomy night two smugglers met    
 a boat carrying brandy.  They were    
 carrying the brandy through Devizes   
 when they heard some excise men coming
 and became scared.They threw the      
 brandy into the Crammer hoping to     
 retrieve it later.That night they came
 back with big rakes and started to    
 rake out the cask. Along came the     
 excise men and asked the smugglers    
 what they were doing.  The smugglers  
 thought quickly and they told the     
 excise men that they were raking      
 cheese from the Crammer. The moon was 
 reflecting on the water so the excise 
 men laughed and laughed as they rode  
 off.                                  
 All Wiltshire people have now adopted 
 the name of Moonrakers.               </content>
