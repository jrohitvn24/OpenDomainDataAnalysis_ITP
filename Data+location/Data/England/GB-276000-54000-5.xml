		<title>05A day at school 2</title>
		<content> During the morning we have a playtime 
 of about 15 minutes.  Morning school  
 ends at 12.00 noon.  Nearly all of the
 children stay at school for luch, only
 three people in the whole school go   
 home.  About half of us have school   
 dinners and the other half of us bring
 packed lunches.  We sit in the main   
 assembly hall to eat. As there isn't  
 enough room for all of us at once     
 there are two sittings.               
                                       
 Quite a few extra lessons are given at
 lunch time, though not at the same    
 time as we are eating!  There are     
 recorder lessons, guitar, chess,      
 dancing and netball and football      
 practice.                             
                                       
 Afternoon school starts properly at   
 1.15 pm.                              
                                       </content>
