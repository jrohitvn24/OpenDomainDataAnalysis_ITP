		<title>07HOUSING NEAR GRIMSBY DOCKS</title>
		<content> Areas of 19th Century{terraced,back to
{back houses}with{no inside toilets}and
 no gardens have been demolished near  
 the docks.In their place are{small    
 blocks of{modern,}council built       
 terraced housing providing far        
 superior amenities and also{open      
{spaces.}This housing is of a much     
{lower density}than the old.This       
 development has been carried out in   
 recent years in preference to         
 re-housing people on council estates  
 on the outskirts of town.In this way  
 the{strong community spirit}of many   
 streets is preserved.Where old,but    
 larger terraced housing               
 exists,{modernisation}has taken place 
 and these provide pleasant homes most 
 of which are privately owned.Much of  
 the rest of the area is composed of   
 inter-war semi- and detached          
 homes,privately owned and low density.</content>
