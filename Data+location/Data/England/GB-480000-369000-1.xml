		<title>01General Review of S.Clifton</title>
		<content> The predominant feature of our D block
 is of a rural nature consisting of    
 three centres of population.The main  
 one is the village of South Clifton.To
 the east of the block is the hamlet of
 Spalford and to the west is High and  
 Loe Marnham.The block is almost       
 divided in half by the River Trent    
 which flows from south to north.On the
 west bank stands Marnham Power        
 station. To the east of the block runs
 the main Newark to Gainsborough Road  
 the A1133.From east to west in the    
 northren part of the block runs the   
 disused railway line which once       
 connected Lincoln with the East       
 Midlands Coalfield.An impressive      
 viaduct still spans the Trent.West of 
 the Trent the railway is still used to
 carry coal to the power station.
