		<title>19PADBURY WOMEN'S INSTITUTE</title>
		<content> Padbury Women's Institute,or the W.I. 
 as most villagers know it, was formed 
 in 1921 making it one of the oldest in
 the area, being formed within 5 years 
 of the first British W.I.(the movement
 started in Canada). Padbury has always
 had a thriving W.I.. Jam still plays  
 its part, members helping to run the  
 W.I. Market in nearby Buckingham, but 
 many other activities are undertaken. 
 It is the W.I. who runs the village   
 produce show, which is held in high   
 regard by judges who come from outside
 the village. A garden sale is held in 
 the summer, the proceeds from this go 
 to provide a dinner and entertainment 
 for 40 to 50 senior citizens in the   
 autumn. The monthly meetings provide  
 speakers on the widest possible range 
 of topics, from Travelling to Russia  
 to Walking in Cornwall. All in all it 
 is another vital part of village life.</content>
