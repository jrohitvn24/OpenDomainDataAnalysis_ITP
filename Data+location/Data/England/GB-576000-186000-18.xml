		<title>18Farming in Sth.Benfleet.</title>
		<content> The farms on the slopes and uplands   
 grow corn.Stubble burning in the      
 autumn caused much trouble to         
 motorists as the very busy Essex Way  
 and the A13 pass through farmland.    
 Efforts have been made to stop this.  
 Straw is much in demand by the very   
 popular riding stables.All farms in   
 Benfleet supplement their income by   
 stabling and grazing horses.          
 Riding is very popular particulary    
 with young girls.Farmland on the      
 levels is used for grazing by cattle  
 and horses.At Sadler's Farm many of   
 the outhouses and stables are now     
 being used as workshops by various    
 craftsmen,who produce furniture,      
 fireplaces,iron_work,etc.
