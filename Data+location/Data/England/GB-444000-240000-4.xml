		<title>04Police in Banbury</title>
		<content> Our Police Station in Banbury is part 
of Thames Valley Police. It was built  
in 1974. It is on Warwick Road.        
  They have eight patrol cars, six     
Panda cars, four C.I.D. vehicles and   
one personel carrier.                  
  There are five male cells and one    
female. The court days are on Mondays, 
Thursdays and Fridays. Juveniles Court 
is held on some Wednesdays.            
  The number of crimes committed since 
January 1st is 2,077.(Today is July    
16th.)                                 
  We found out that they do not use    
horses, but they have two police dogs. 
  They have four shifts with eight men 
on each shift and a sergeant and an    
inspector. There is one Chief Inspector
and a Superintendant.                  
  Our community policeman is P.C.      
Snelling. He sometimes comes into      
school to give us talks.               </content>
