		<content>   Handicrafts have always been part of
 living, but in recent times have      
 become more popular. In the villages  
 around Bredon Hill, there has been a  
 great revival in the art of lace      
 making and several people are also    
 learning the art of tatting. This is  
 sometimes called "poor mans lace", but
 it is in fact an art in it's own      
 right.                                
   Both spinning and weaving are       
 coming into their own, with some      
 people starting with the fleece and   
 finishing with the completed garment. 
   Other types of craft still being    
 practised are macrame, enamelling,    
 pressed flower decorations, pewter    
 jewellery, soft toys, cane and rush   
 work, paper crafts and every          
 conceivable type of canvas work and   
 embroidery.                           
                                       </content>
