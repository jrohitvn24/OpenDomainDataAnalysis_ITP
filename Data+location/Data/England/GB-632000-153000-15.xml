		<title>15HACKLINGE AREA GOVERNMENT</title>
		<content> The area is administered by 3 tiers of
 local government. 4 Parish Councils   
 include parts of the regions in their 
 territories. 3 Councillors are elected
 to Dover District Council and 1 County
 Councillor is elected to Kent at Maid-
 stone. All these representatives are  
 glad to give their help when asked.   
 Parish Councils bear the responsib-   
 ility of looking after the interest of
 people in their immediate environs.   
 District Councils administer local    
 services and collect the rates for the
 County Council to provide education,  
 roads, police, libraries, the fire    
 service and social services.          
 Part of the area is in South Thanet   
 Parliamentary Constituency and part in
 Dover Constituency. Both send         
 Conservative MPs to Westminster at    
 present.
