		<title>08THE PET SHOP, WYKE</title>
		<content>   The working day of the proprietress 
 of the local pet shop begins at 8am.  
 She works a six day week till eight in
 the evening, occasionally helped by   
 other members of the family.  Owning a
 shop which deals in 'live stock' means
 there is much work to be done,        
 feeding, cleaning and caring for the  
 animals as well as dealing with       
 customers.  The shop is always busy   
 which is a testimony to its friendly  
 service.                              
   The most popular pet purchased by   
 customers is the mouse, but the shop  
 also keeps more exotic animals.  The  
 owner's favourite is a parrot called  
 Polly, whilst her husband favours the 
 pythons and reptiles.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
