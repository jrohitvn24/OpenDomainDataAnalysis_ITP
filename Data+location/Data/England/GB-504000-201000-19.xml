 There are intensively managed areas of
 grassland. Cattle predominate, but    
 there is a growing tendancy for their 
 replacement by sheep.                 
 Crops are alfalfa and grain for       
 feeding stock and recently rape for   
 vegetable oil production. Both north  
 and south of the canal there are areas
 of rough grazing for horses and cattle
 respectively.

 East of the canal, are smallholdings  
 raising poultry and orchards growing  
 cherries, plums and apples. West of   
 the canal, a large "pick your own"    
 market garden produces strawberries,  
 black and red currants, gooseberries  
 and raspberries in season.Also, a wide
 selection of vegetables comprised of  
 broad, dwarf and runner beans, peas,  
 sweetcorn and potatoes are available. </content>
