		<title>20THE SHOPPING PRECINCT</title>
		<content> When Dawn , David, my mum and me go   
 down to the precinct to shop at the   
 Co-op there is always a lot of litter 
 around the shop. When I go to the     
 Queen's Medical Centre there is not a 
 lot of litter because it is so tidy.  
 One day in the precinct I saw a man   
 throw a chip wrapper on the ground, I 
 went over and picked it up and put it 
 in a litter bin. Another man told me  
 that I was a good girl. I wish        
 Cotgrave was a lot neater and people  
 didn't throw litter around. Mr. Hurt, 
 our Headmaster, told us that only     
 fools want to make their village look 
 untidy.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
