 Mr. Onions is in charge of 29 postmen 
 who deliver to:Oakengates, Town       
 Centre, Trench, Donnington, Muxton,   
 Redhill and Priorslee. Although the   
 building is new and large they have no
 machines to sort the mail. This is    
 still done by hand.                   
                                       
 Oakengates Police Station.            
 __________________________            
 It was built in 1957. 10 police       
 officers and 4 C.I.D. officers work   
 there. There are about 150 crimes     
 committed each month. Theft is        
 the crime that they deal with most.   
 They get about 6 emergency calls each 
 day. However most of the work is paper
 -work. The building has a kennel for  
 stray dogs and a redundant prison     
 cell.                                 </content>
