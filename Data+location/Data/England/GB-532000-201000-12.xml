		<title>12Shopping in Cheshunt</title>
		<content> There is an abundance of small        
 shops in this area, although recently 
 larger shopping complexes have been   
 developed.A general criticism of the  
 shopping facilities is the lack of    
 variety whilst some people complain   
 about the prices charged at their     
 local shops.Dominating the area is the
 new Tescos complex.This was built two 
 years ago and amongst the many        
 facilities offered are a cafe,flower  
 shop and a free bus service.This has  
 resulted in an influx of people       
 travelling in from Enfield, Hertford, 
 Waltham Cross and Waltham Abbey.The   
 presence London, only ten miles away, 
 means that much shopping is done on a 
 commuting basis with many families    
 returning to their original community.
