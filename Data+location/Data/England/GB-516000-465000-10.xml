		<content>    7:05am my alarm goes off, so I drag
 myself out of bed, crawl across the   
 room and switch it off. Then I go back
 to bed!                               
    7:20am I decide to get up, stagger 
 to the bathroom have a wash and wake  
 myself up.                            
    7:30am I decide to get dressed     
 which usually takes 15 minutes.       
    7:45am I go into the kitchen, let  
 the dog out and collect the milk from 
 the doorstep. By this time the rest of
 the family are up. This time is       
 usually chaotic, so I take my         
 breakfast into the living room and    
 watch TV.                             
    8:10am I brush my teeth and get my 
 books ready for school.               
    8:25am I set off for school, I walk
 to my friend's house, arriving there  
 about 8:40, we wait for another friend
 and walk to school together.          </content>
