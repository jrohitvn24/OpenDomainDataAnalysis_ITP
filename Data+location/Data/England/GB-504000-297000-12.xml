		<title>12WANSFORD POST OFFICE</title>
		<content>  There has been a shop on this site   
 for many years, but the Post Office   
 was added five years ago. The shop was
 originally a house on the Great North 
 Road and has been extended backwards  
 into two cottages, one of which       
 contains the Post Office.             
  The shop sells a wide range of goods,
 including items which might normally  
 be seen in other types of shops.      
  The Post Office also offers different
 services because it serves a wide     
 area: The postmaster collects council 
 rents, issues car tax, deals with     
 National Savings Bank deposits as well
 as paying out Department of Health and
 Social Security benefits. The Post    
 Office also acts as a mail sorting    
 office and three post-men work from   
 this office to deliver letters to the 
 surrounding villages.
