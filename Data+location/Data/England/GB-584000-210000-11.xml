		<content>      Godfrey's Bungalow, owned by Mr. 
 and Mrs. Double specializes in Tomato 
 growing.                              
      They have three greenhouses, each
 covering one third of an acre. The    
 boiler which heats them uses 8 gallons
 of oil an hour.                       
      In February the greenhouse soil  
 is rotavated, then flooded for a week.
 The Marathon variety of plants are put
 into border soil in March. One truss  
 forms each week. The tomato plants are
 subject to pests such as whitefly and 
 red spider. The tomatoes are ready for
 picking by mid June and the season    
 goes on until mid Movember, when the  
 greenhouses are sterilised.           
      Tomatoes are graded on a machine 
 which would cost between Â£1500  and   
 Â£2000 to replace. They are boxed and  
 sent to Stratford Market. 25 tons of  
 tomatoes are grown each year.         </content>
