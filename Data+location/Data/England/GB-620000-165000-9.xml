		<content> The{SHEPHERD}remembers : there were   
 gates on the road at Marshside        
 then,like a turnpike. We kids could   
 get money opening them for rich       
 visitors{.BARGES}used to come to      
 Reculver with manure from London,     
 they went back with hay. Sometimes    
 there was trouble in the community    
{RICK BURNING.}About 1929 it was very  
 bad, whole farms burnt up. All the    
 marshes were grazing land and we kids 
 could roam where we liked, everybody  
 knew you by name out as far as        
 Brooksend and Canterbury.In{WWII}the  
 whole area was a training ground. you 
 did not know what would happen next,  
 with bullets flying around. My old    
 horse would stand without looking     
 while they fired a 2" mortar next to  
 it all day. the Shepherd was in the   
 L.D.V. attendence one night a week.   
 some bombs fell in the area.          </content>
