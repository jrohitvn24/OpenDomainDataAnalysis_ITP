		<content> Are the sand dunes still? No!         
 Trees, unexpecting the ambush,        
 Disappear under the advancing sand.   
 Ponds unexpecting death,              
 Filled in by wind-driven sand,        
 Creeping inwards,                     
 Leaving the sea behind.               
 The top-most branches of trees,       
 Like antlers on a head.               
 Warriors from the sea attack!         
 Destroying all that is in the way.    
 Can we hold back the invaders?        
 They will not retreat.                
 But neither will we!                  
 We'll dig out the ponds,              
 Again, and again!                     
 But the sand still moves on.          
 Men have brains!             {Matthew 
 But nature has power!         {Lewis  
 Who will win this war?      {(aged 11)
 Maybe men, maybe sand.                
 Humans I think, we'll think of a way. </content>
