		<title>03FARMING IN CULMSTOCK</title>
		<content> This is an area of 'mixed' farming    
 which consists of dairy, beef and     
 sheep farming, battery egg production 
 and crop growing.  Milking is done by 
 machine on the farm and collected by  
 milk tanker to be taken to a Factory. 
 The farms - between 50 and 120 acres -
 are family-owned and worked by the    
 farmer and his family, with much      
 co-operation from neighbouring        
 farmers regarding machinery and       
 labour. Most cattle is Friesian, with 
 Friesian Cross, (mainly with          
 Hereford) kept for beef production.   
 Primarily,fields are intensively-     
 managed grassland for pasture or      
 for cutting as grass, silage or       
 hay; next are cultivated fields of    
 mixed grain for animal feed, followed 
 by enclosed rough grazing for cattle  
 and sheep.
