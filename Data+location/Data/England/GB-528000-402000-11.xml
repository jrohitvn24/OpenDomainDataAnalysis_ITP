		<title>11DAY IN THE LIFE OF MR.GOODEY</title>
		<content> I woke up at{6.30a.m.}got dressed and 
 had my breakfast. I put my waterproof 
 trousers on to water the{cacti and    
{plants.}I finished at{9.00a.m.}and    
 opened the{nursery.}No sooner had I   
 opened, than one of my workers        
 arrived. Now I could go and repot some
{cacti.}When I looked at my watch again
 it was{12.30p.m.}so I went for dinner.
 I finished at{1.30p.m.}Suddenly the   
 phone rang. It was someone to say the 
 van was ready for hiring. I collected 
 it, brought it home and started to    
 load it with{cacti}because I was going
 to a show the next day. I had my tea  
 at{4.30p.m.}I did some watering,      
 finishing at{8.00p.m.}At{10.00p.m.}I  
 went to bed, after having watched     
 television.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
