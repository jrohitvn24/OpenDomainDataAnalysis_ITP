		<title>05Residents Concerns</title>
		<content>The residents feel that most of the    
local facilities are centred towards   
the Village -which is some distance    
away- and that they are unlikely to be 
given many of their wishes.            
   People felt that the lack of medical
assistance close to the area caused    
problems and they wished that a health 
centre of some kind could be built in  
the area.                              
    Recently part of the area had its  
boundary changed and was tranferred    
from Lancashire into Merseyside. The   
rates increased and people in the      
area feel the rates are much too       
high for the facilities which they are 
given.                                 
       Their grievance is born out by  
the fact that in our count we found    
there to be few shopping, sports or    
recreational facilities.
