		<title>17USE OF LAND IN HAYFIELD</title>
		<content> The land in this area is mainly used  
 for sheep farming.Not much cattle     
 farming is carried on because of the  
 quality of the grass. Sheep can eat   
 short, wiry grass but cattle have to  
 be fed long,jucy grass if they are    
 going to give lots of milk.Arable     
 farming is difficult because the area 
 is so hilly.The area around Hayfield  
 is mainly agricultural rather than    
 industrial.It is mainly moorland which
 is crossed by two main roads carrying 
 traffic to Chapel,New Mills,Birch     
 Vale and Glossop.There is very little 
 derelict land or abandoned houses,    
 because people are eager to renovate  
 any old property.Some of the land is  
 covered by quarries,but these are now 
 mainly disused.Hayfield has areas for 
 recreation,but these are just outside 
 the area we studied.
