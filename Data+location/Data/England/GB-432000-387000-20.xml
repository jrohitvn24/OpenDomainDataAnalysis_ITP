		<title>20A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content>   It was Wednesday. I got up quickly. 
 It was 5 o'clock. I went to the       
 bathroom, washed my face, brushed my  
 teeth and went downstairs.            
   When I opened the door of the       
 sitting-room, everybody said,{"Happy  
{Eid"}in Pakistani.                    
   My mum said, "Go upstairs and get   
 dressed, it's Eid today." I said,     
 "Hurray,hurray, it's Eid."            
   So I went upstairs, got dressed, put
 on my jewels, put on my make-up, and  
 put on my new shoes. Then I went      
 downstairs.                           
   My mum gave me some money and I went
 to my friend's house.                 
   I did not have my dinner at the     
 right time.I played in the park, went 
 to a lot of shops and{I ate, ate, ate 
{and played, played, played all day.   
                                       
                                       </content>
