		<title>07The Tower of St Peter's.</title>
		<content>    St Peter's church tower is         
unusual because it is separated from   
the main body of the church.  This     
happened because years ago when the    
church was made into a college for     
monks, their living quarters were built
in the tower.  You can still see the   
fireplaces up high in the walls but    
the floors have gone.  To the north    
east of the tower are two underground  
vaulted rooms.   The kitchen which was 
used by the monks is still there.      
It is called "Old Marlows Parlour".    
The medieval oven can be seen. There   
is a fine vaulted roof, a carved date  
and masons marks.  The tower is 99     
feet high crowned by an octagonal      
lantern. In earlier times this         
lantern was lit to guide travellers    
across the dangerous river valley.
