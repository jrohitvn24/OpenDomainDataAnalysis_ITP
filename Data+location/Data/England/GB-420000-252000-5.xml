		<content> On the afternoon of Saturday March 6th
 1926 the original Memorial Theatre    
 went up in flames.This theatre is one 
 of the main tourists attractions in   
 Stratford.Outside the door there is a 
 stone laid by the Lord Ampthill the   
 most worshipful Pro Grand master of   
 the United Grand Lodge of England on  
 the 2nd July 1929 to commemorate the  
 rebuilding of the Shakespeare Memorial
 Theatre.People come from far and near 
 to see plays like Macbeth.The Royal   
 Shakespeare Company of Stratford put  
 on most the productions.Seats cost    
 anything from Â£4 to Â£15.There are     
 about 6 productions a year.The first  
 productions for 1985/86 season are    
 Merry Wives of Windsor,As You Like It,
 Troilus and Cressida.Nowadays theres a
 restaurant where people can go after  
 the performance to eat and there is   
 also a bar upstairs near a gift shop. </content>
