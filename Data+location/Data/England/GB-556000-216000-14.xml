		<title>14BONFIRE NIGHT</title>
		<content> The Gt. Canfield Society organises    
 Bonfire Night at Marsh Farm.  Large   
 bonfire about 20 ft. high; fine fire  
 works display.  Event is normally held
 on Saturday nearest Nov. 5 (Guy Fawkes
 Night).  Safety is important.  Several
 members of society have taken a course
 in safety.  Display is isolated by    
 rope barrier and straw bales which act
 as seats.  A bar, set up in a barn,   
 and a barbeque form background to the 
 event.  Fireworks are expensive and a 
 large audience is attracted, so a     
 profitable show must be put on.       
 Purchasing fireworks and food and     
 running the bar need detailed         
 organisation so that profit is made.  
 In recent years this has gone toward  
 upkeep of the village Church.
