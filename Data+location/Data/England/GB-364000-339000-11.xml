		<title>11SHOPPING IN ADDERLEY</title>
		<content>                                       
 We have three shops in our village.One
 shop is the Post Office.Tom Butter    
 looks after it,he has been living in  
 Adderley all his life.There have been 
 Post Offices in Adderley over fifty   
 five years,Tom's Post Office has been 
 there five years.His customers are not
 all local,some cars stop as they      
 travel through.His busiest day is     
 Thursday when the magazines arrive.   
 There is also a garage belonging to   
 Chuck Jones.He has worked there for   
 eight years ,but the garage has been  
 there for twenty.All his customers are
 local.The busiest day is Saturday.    
 Every morning newspapers are delivered
 from Audlem,but in the evening Suzanne
 Brookes delivers the Shropshire Star. 
 Next to the Post Office there is an   
 Antique shop,but we don't go there    
 very often.                           </content>
