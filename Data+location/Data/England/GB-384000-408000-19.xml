		<title>19The Future.</title>
		<content>  The immediate {Future} is uncertain. 
 We await with interest the effects of 
 the abolition of {Greater Manchester  
{Council,}and what this will mean for  
 us, especially in areas like {Local   
{Transport.}We also will wait to see   
 how this affects {Rochdale} and its   
 relationships with {Heywood and       
{Middleton,} its partners. In our      
 schools, as numbers change, we face { 
{Re-organization,} but as yet, the     
 shape of the new scheme is not clear. 
 It is possible that {Heywood} will    
 emerge as a dormitory town, as we     
 suggested (see p.15) and we would hope
 this will help to solve the           
 unemployment problem and help the town
 to keep its separate identity. As for 
 us, we plan {an Exhibition} of all    
 this work in November, and we hope    
 that the co-operation we have gained  
 will continue for a very long time.   </content>
