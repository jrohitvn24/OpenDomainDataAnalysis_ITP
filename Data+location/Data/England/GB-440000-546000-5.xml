		<content> AROUND SEAHAM WE HAVE MANY BEAUTIFUL  
 PLACES WHERE RESIDENTS OFTEN TAKE     
 WALKS.DALTON LE DALE IS A SMALL       
 VILLAGE TO THE SOUTH OF SEAHAM.IT HAS 
 A SAXON CHURCH,ST.ANDREWS,WITH A      
 GRAVEYARD.TINY FLOWERS GROW IN THE    
 CRACKS IN THE STONES.PEOPLE WALK ALONG
 THE PATHWAY BY THE STREAM AND OFTEN   
 SEE HOLES IN THE BANKS WHERE BADGERS  
 LIVE IN SETS.THERE ARE PUBLIC         
 FOOTPATHS ACROSS FIELDS AND THROUGH   
 WOODS BUT CARE MUST BE TAKEN TO CLOSE 
 FARM GATES SO THAT ANIMALS WILL NOT   
 STRAY.WE SEE MANY WILD FLOWERS SUCH AS
 GIANT HOGWEED,TALLER THAN US,AND      
 FORGET-ME-NOTS,LIKE TINY BLUE STARS.IN
 SPRING THE BLOSSOM COVERS THE TREES   
 AND IN AUTUMN THE LEAVES ARE RED AND  
 GOLDEN.SOME FIELDS GLOW A GOLDEN      
 YELLOW.THIS CROP IS CALLED "RAPE" AND 
 THE FARMERS GROW IT FOR ITS SEED OIL.
