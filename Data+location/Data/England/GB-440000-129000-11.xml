		<content>  Farley Mount Country Park covers a   
 large area.It has lots of trees and   
 fields in it.There are also lots of   
 wild flowers which include cowslips,  
 bluebells,primroses and many more.    
 There are lots of steep slopes.       
  The monument itself was put there    
 in memory of a horse who fell down a  
 twenty five foot deep chalk pit.This  
 happened in 1733.It stands on Beacon  
 Hill which is the highest point in the
 area.This hill was used to light fires
 on as a warning system.In 1977 a fire 
 was lit to celebrate Queen Elizabeth  
 2nd's Silver Jubilee.                 
  On a clear day you can see Salisbury 
 Cathedral spire from here.            
  The Forrestry Commission manage this 
 park which is near to Crab Wood.
