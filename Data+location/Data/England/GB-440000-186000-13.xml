		<title>13Lockinge Estate,Ardington(1)</title>
		<content>Locking Estate was built up in the late
19th.Century by Lord and Lady Wantage  
after Lady Wantage's father had settled
money and some land in Lockinge on them
 when they married.                    
Over the years from 1859 to about 1890 
the family made many purchases of land 
until the estate was complete.They     
spent a great deal of time and money   
in improving the villages of Ardington 
and Lockinge.Some old and decrepit     
housing was removed and model cottages 
built in 1860 and other buildings were 
improved.  The estate is still in the  
hands of the same family,but it has    
changed its nature.In 1900 there were  
850 people living in the villages and  
the entire working population was      
employed by the estate.By 1960 there   
were 700 people and 160 employees.Now  
the decline in numbers is arrested but 
the estate employs only 50.            </content>
