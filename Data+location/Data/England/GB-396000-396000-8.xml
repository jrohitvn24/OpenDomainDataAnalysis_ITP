		<content> The elm trees in the park have had to 
 be cut down because of Dutch Elm      
 disease, which has been rife for some 
 years now. There is no cure at the    
 moment, so many trees have been lost. 
 The Park Warden told us there was a   
 danger that England would lose all its
 Elm trees.                            
 The Cheetham family owned many cotton 
 mills. They planted most of the trees 
 in the park. The Yew trees are the    
 oldest. The house that the Cheethams  
 lived in, was pulled down 30 years    
 ago. The most famous mill built by the
 Cheethams is called Bankwood Mill.    
 The park is built on a very steep     
 piece of land. It is mainly natural,  
 but is now having some formal lawns   
 and flowers introduced. The latest    
 part is an adventure playpark, built  
 for the younger children of the       
 neighbourhood.                        </content>
