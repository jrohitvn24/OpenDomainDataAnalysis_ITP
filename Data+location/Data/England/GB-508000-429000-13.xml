		<title>13STEPNEY REMEMBERED : HULL</title>
		<content>      Born in 1886 - the year Stepney  
 Primary School was built, the old man 
 recalled his schooldays.              
      He told us how all the teachers  
 carried sticks or straps which they   
 used a lot.   There were games periods
 but not at playing fields (we         
 sometimes go to Pearson Park) but in  
 the school yard.   His favourite was  
 rounders.                             
      For holidays they had only two   
 weeks in Summer, plus Bank Holidays.  
      There were no school meals and at
 lunchtime he went to a cafe at Cave   
 Street where he bought soup for one   
 penny.                                
      He came from a poor family and so
 left school at thirteen (most left at 
 fourteen) to work on the horse-drawn  
 trams, which were changed just outside
 the school.
