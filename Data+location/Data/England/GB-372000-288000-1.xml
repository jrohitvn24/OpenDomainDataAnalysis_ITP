		<title>01INTRO S.E.BRIDGNORTH SALOP</title>
		<content>  The area concerned is about 2km{south
{of Bridgnorth in South Shropshire}in  
 the West Midlands. It straddles the   
{River Severn,}which is Britain's      
 longest river. The landscape is gently
 undulating, ranging from 118m to 30m. 
  The area is largely{rural}with       
 intensive agriculture; there is also a
 large area of coniferous woodland.    
  There are 3 villages, Eardington,    
 Quatt and Quatford,a number of hamlets
 such as Mose and Astbury and several  
 farms. The main road passing through  
 is the A442 from Bridgnorth to        
 Kidderminster.                        
  Economically the area is dominated by
 farming, although in this scenic part 
 of Shropshire tourism is              
 important. The area also has many     
 retired people.{Dudmaston Hall}near   
 Quatt was recorded in the original    
 Domesday Book.                        </content>
