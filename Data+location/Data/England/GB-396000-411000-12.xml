		<title>12THE   FIGHTING OF  THE FIRES</title>
		<content> It takes a long time to put out       
 moorland fires because there are not  
 many water supplies.The only supplies 
 are reservoirs,lakes,water tanks,     
 streams, and brooks. The main problem 
 is getting at the water. If it is in  
 boggy ground two firemen can carry a  
 small pump to the water. If they are a
 long way from water there is an       
 appliance that carries a mile of hose.
      Sometimes a fire break is used   
 that is where a path is cleared in    
 front of the fire to prevent its      
 progress. This does not always work on
 the moors for the fire can travel     
 underground in the deep peat.Firemen  
 always work in pairs for the smoke is 
 so thick that you could become        
 overcome by the smoke or lose your    
 way.
