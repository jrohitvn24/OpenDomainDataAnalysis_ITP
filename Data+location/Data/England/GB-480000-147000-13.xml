		<title>13HALE RELIEF ROAD</title>
		<content>   On the Upper Hale road there is a   
 car every 7 seconds at a quiet        
 time.There is at least 1 accident on  
 the Hale road in one week.One of the  
 benefits of having a by_pass through  
 the park is that it would be quieter  
 for the people who live on the road.  
 Another benefit is that there will be 
 less traffic on the Hale road and     
 therefore fewer accidents.Although    
 having a by_pass would help the Upper 
 Hale Road it would spoil the park and 
 pollute the air as well as spoiling   
 walks and peoples leisure.
