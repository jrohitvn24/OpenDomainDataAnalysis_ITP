    This is mainly a rural area with   
many minor roads.The busiest road is   
the A137 carrying traffic from         
Colchester and Manningtree to Ipswich. 
Most of the other roads are quiet roads
only used by local traffic.These roads 
are often narrow accommodating only one
car.Lemon's Hill Bridge was built in   
1980 to take traffic across the newly  
constructed Alton Water Reservoir.It is
difficult to travel in this area unless
you own a car.                         
    The only bus service here is the   
Eastern Counties Bus Service.The 123,  
223,224 buses bring passengers from    
East Bergholt and beyond through Capel 
St.Mary, Bentley, Tattingstone and     
Belstead to Ipswich five times daily.  
   Trains to London are caught from    
Ipswch or Manningtree.The line was     
electrified in 1985.                   </content>
