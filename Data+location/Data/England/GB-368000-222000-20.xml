		<content>  The survey made of this block would  
 not have been possible without the    
 help of many people. Members of the   
{Aston Ingham Women's Institute}helped 
 with the Survey and some of the text. 
{ The Abbey de Cormeilles Venture Unit 
 also aided us in this and undertook   
 the visiting of some of the more      
 distant places.                       
  We are also grateful to the many     
 people who gave of their time and     
 knowledge to complete the entries.    
  The final entry onto the disc was the
 work of one of the members of the     
 Women's Institute.
