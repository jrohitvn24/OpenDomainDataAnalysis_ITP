		<content>     Of the three{Stately Homes}in this
 area two of them are still lived in by
 the families that built them.They are 
 Brodsworth Hall and Hooton Hall.      
 The houses are built in very different
 styles.The family who built Brodsworth
 Hall came over from France during the 
 French Revolution and they were       
{Huguenots.}Lots of the furnishing and 
 ornaments are French style.There are  
 also some paintings that the family   
 brought over from France.There was a  
 skirmish at Hooton during the time of 
 the{Civil War}according to local      
 tradition at a place known to the     
 locals only as Oliver Hill.It is not  
 shown on the Ordnance Survey map.In   
 World War 2 Lord Halifax was refused  
 entry into his home at Hickleton Hall 
 by a sentry after returning late from 
 a very important cabinet meeting in   
 London.The soldier was commended.     </content>
