		<content>People feel generally that this is a   
suitable place to raise children and   
live a safe and comfortable life.      
The main concerns of the Green Street  
Green Association are environmental    
problems, such as cleanliness of       
streets and development/planning       
permission.                            
Vandalism is a major problem for local 
farms and sports clubs.There are       
Â£Neighbourhood Watch' schemes in the   
area, and this community approach to   
crime prevention was felt to be of     
great value.                           
Most people are happy with their local 
shops, and are against Sunday opening  
on religious grounds.                  
Children like the area because they are
near to open spaces and woodland where 
they can play, but teenagers find      
little to do. The nearest discos,      
theatres and cinemas are in Bromley.   </content>
