{Maths}: Maths is a very useful subject
 that everyone should do to enable them
 to get jobs at a later date.          
{English}: This is the most important  
 subject in school. It is especially   
 important in jobs which invlove       
 english ie newspaper editor.          
{Computer Studies}: This subject is    
 very useful because, in the future    
 computers will be involved in every   
 day life.                             
{Geography}: Geography helps us to know
 the land on which we live. If you     
 wanted to start a farm you would need 
 to know if the soil was good.         
{French}: Its important to learn       
 another language to enable you to go  
 abroad. It is sensible to learn French
 because it is the closest country to  
 Britain.                              </content>
