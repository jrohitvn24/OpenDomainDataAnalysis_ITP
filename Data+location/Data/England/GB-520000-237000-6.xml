		<title>06Etonbury Middle School</title>
		<content>   Etonbury school was built in 1953   
 as a secondary school.It was called   
 Etonbury because of the Anglo-Saxon   
 earthworks of the same name nearby.   
   It was opened in 1955 but not       
 completed until 1958.An exposed yet   
 prominent site between Arlesey and    
 Stotfold was chosen for the school    
 which draws its pupils from these two 
 villages.                             
   The school became a Middle School   
 for children between the ages of 9 to 
 13 when Bedfordshire reorganised its  
 schools into comprehensives in 1975.  
   The number of children who attend   
 the school now number approximately   
 440 and there are 20 teachers employed
 there.
