		<title>04RIVER CALDEW NEAR DALSTON</title>
		<content>   This section of the{River Caldew}is 
 between Rose Castle and Bridge End. On
 this stretch there is only one road   
 bridge, which is at Bridge End, and a 
 weir, which is just upstream from     
 the bridge.                           
                                       
   On the{River Caldew}is a derelict   
 turbine wheelhouse which used to be   
 used to make electricity. It is       
 opposite Willowclose Wood and just by 
 Highwath Bridge. This footbridge joins
 Highwath Wood and Willowclose Wood    
 together. These are the two main woods
 on this section of the river.         
                                       
   There is one main river which joins 
 the{River Caldew}: Roe Beck, also     
 known as River Roe. This river runs   
 through Gaitsgill on a bend. Gaitsgill
 Bridge crosses the river there.
