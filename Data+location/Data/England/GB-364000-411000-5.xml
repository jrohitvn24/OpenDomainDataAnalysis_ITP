		<title>05WINTER HILL</title>
		<content> Our survey on the southern edge of    
 Winter Hill under Rivington Pike,Brown
 Hill and Crooked Edge found a large   
 area of uncultivated moorland         
 stretching to 1400 feet.Conservation  
 Volunteers Trust have started to plant
 the western tip with rowans and       
 conifers and there is one area of     
 reclaimed farmland at Higher Knoll.   
 The most significant natural feature  
 is the River Douglas which has its    
 source on these moors before forming  
 the boundary of Greater Manchester and
 Lancashire as it makes its way        
 westwards.Its flow is helped by the   
 many land drains which the water      
 boards,at first for Liverpool         
 Corporation,have put in.Flat areas at 
 the top of the moors are still very   
 boggy.
