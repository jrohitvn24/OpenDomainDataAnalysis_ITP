		<content> Before the Second World War most of   
 Parkwood was woodland and some trees  
 have been left as the area has been   
 developed, notably around a large     
 playing field where local football    
 teams play. The housing consists of   
 terraces and small blocks of flats    
 with some semi-detached houses and    
 bungalows; a number of old people live
 in these and they attend the old      
 people's Christmas Party that is      
 arranged each year by Senacre School. 
 There is a large block of shops around
 a car park which includes two         
 newsagents (one the P.O.), a chemist, 
 a supermarket, a fish and chip shop   
 and a sandwich bar, where some        
 schoolchildren get their lunch instead
 of having school dinners. On the edge 
 of the park is a Kent Boys' Club.
