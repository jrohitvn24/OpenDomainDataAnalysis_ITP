		<title>10Antiques in Nantwich.</title>
		<content>   The image of Nantwich as an{historic
{market town}has helped to give rise to
 its tradition and reputation for fine 
 art and antiques.The presence of a    
 large number of dealers (currently 17)
 in a small area draws other dealers   
 from all over Britain,Europe,and as   
 far afield as America and Australia.  
 The{antique shops and salerooms}are an
 obvious attraction for tourists       
 However,although they like to look,   
 tourists do not buy many antiques,    
 which are usually bulky or fragile.In 
 fact the main trade in antiques tends 
 to be between dealers,and during      
 Spring and Autumn,out of the peak     
 tourist season.Most of the Nantwich   
 dealers trade in general antiques,    
 though a few specialise in furniture  
 which is always in demand.{Stafford-  
{shire china}is also very popular and  
 sold regularly at local auctions.     </content>
