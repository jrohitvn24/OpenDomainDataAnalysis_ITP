		<content>    In 1974 Severn and Trent water     
 authority put main line sewerage into 
 villages close by and promised to     
 bring it to Caunton, but when the time
 came Severn and Trent decided not to  
 bring it any further.                 
    The Parish Council were quite      
 annoyed and started to write letters. 
 Severn and Trent turned down these    
 requests.                             
    1982 main line sewerage was        
 offered again.                        
    The local population were now      
 unsure as to whether they wanted main 
 line sewerage or not.                 
 The argument against was there would  
 be new houses and it would spoil the  
 countryside.                          
    Eventually a meeting was held and  
 nine out of ten people in Caunton     
 voted against main line sewage.
