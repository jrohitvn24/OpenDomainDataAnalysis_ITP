		<content> Between Catterick and Tunstall there  
 are three public houses, an art       
 gallery, a second-hand book shop, a   
 retail oil business, a caravan site, a
 post office with general store, one   
 clothes store, a horse and carriage   
 hire service and a vehicle repair     
 workshop. The public houses are well  
 supported by locals and visitors. The 
 art gallery, bookshop and caravan site
 rely mainly on summer tade. The post  
 office with general store, the        
 clothing store and retail oil business
 enjoy trade all the year round. The   
 sludge tanker serves homes not        
 connected to the main sewerage system,
 the vehicle repair workshop is        
 patronized by locals and visitors and 
 the horse and carriage is a familiar  
 sight at weddings and social occasions
