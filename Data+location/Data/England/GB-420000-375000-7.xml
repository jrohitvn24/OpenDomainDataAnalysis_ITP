 About a hundred years ago there was a 
 pond near the church now there is a   
 Sheep-roast there.Near the Sheep-roast
 there are two troughs the troughs have
 no water in them now.The Sheep-roast  
 is held on Carnival day.              
{PLAGUE-SUNDAY.                        
 Plague-Sunday is to celebrate the     
 last day of the Plague. After a       
 service in church a procession goes   
 from the church to the Delf.At the    
 time of the Plague the people of Eyam 
 used to hold services in the Delf.The 
 rector  was always there because he   
 was pleading with the people to stay  
 in the village.To-day people come from
 many parts to join in the service.
