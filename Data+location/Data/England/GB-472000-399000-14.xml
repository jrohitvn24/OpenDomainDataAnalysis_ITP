		<content>    The{School Trustees}are a group of 
 people who live in the Parish of Haxey

 founded as part of a  Charitable Trust
 after the building of Westwoodside    
 School in 1885. This body was to      
 provide finance, books, teachers etc. 
 the two Parish schools, and is still  
 existing today.

 takes the latter form.                
   Bibles are presented by{Trustees    
 each year to the fourth year pupils of
 W.W.S. and Haxey schools.             
  {Trustee}members inclulde the vicar  
 of Haxey, and members of the Parish   
 Council. Other persons residing or    
 carrying out business in the parish   
 may be elected for life as a{Trustee. </content>
