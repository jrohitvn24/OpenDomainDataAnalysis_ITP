		<content>   Two railways pass through{Hazel     
{Grove.}In 1854, the Stockport, Disley 
 and Whaley Bridge Company built a     
 railway from Edgeley to Whaley Bridge,
 including a station at{Hazel Grove.   
 The line opened in 1847 and was later 
 extended to Buxton and is still in    
 use. The other was built by Midland   
 Railway in 1902 to provide an express 
 route from Buxton to London via       
 Macclesfield. Another station was     
 built on the eastern side of{Hazel    
{Grove.}It closed to passengers in     
 1917. The line to{Hazel Grove}from    
 Edgeley was electrified and the       
 Station rebuilt in 1977.In 1985 work  
 started on a scheme to link these two 
 lines to provide a route through to   
 Sheffield.This is probably the only   
 part of the railway system to be built
 for a long time. A new 'halt type     
 station will have to be built.        </content>
