		<content>  In the last question of our          
 questionnaire the villagers were asked
 why they preferred the{LIFESTYLE}of   
 a village to a town.                  
  Many did not like the bustle and     
 traffic of a town, although some said 
 that there could be less traffic, and 
 improved bus service and more street  
 lighting, in the village.             
  The majority gave reasons that they  
 enjoyed rural and village life, it was
 convenient for towns (provided they   
 had a car) and many had friends in the
 village. Some villagers had been born 
 in the area and lived there all their 
 lives (one since 1925). One liked the 
 horses and the peace of the country.  
  Many said that they did not live in a
 town because they disliked noise,     
 traffic, bustle and one because he    
 would not be able to settle.
