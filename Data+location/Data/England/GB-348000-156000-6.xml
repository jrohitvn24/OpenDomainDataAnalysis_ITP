		<title>06BLAGDON SCHOOL DINNER TIME</title>
		<content> At 12.00 noon Monday to Friday at     
 Blagdon School the bell rings for     
 dinner. We all{walk}into the cloak    
 rooms to{wash our hands}and line up.If
 the dinners are late in arriving we go
 to the back playground to play until  
 the dinners do arrive.Then one of the 
 dinner ladies calls us to line up.    
 Once we have lined up we walk to the  
 hall. About 40 people have school     
 meals, the rest have packed lunches.  
 The meals are not bad but it isn't as 
 nice as home cooking, because the food
 is cooked in Weston.Afterwards we take
 turns to stack chairs and then we go  
 out in the playground to play. We     
 usually play games like{Bulldogs,Toe  
{Touch,Cock-a-Rooster}or{Red-Rovers.}If
 it's a rainy day we stay inside to    
 talk and read comics. At 1.15 the bell
 rings to end our dinner hour.Back to  
 work again!                           </content>
