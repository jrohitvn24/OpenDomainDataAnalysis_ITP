		<title>01ETTINGTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content>  Ettington is a village six miles east
 of Stratford-upon-Avon.It lies on what
 used to be the cross roads of the     
 Stratford-Banbury road and the        
 Warwick - Halford road, although the  
 latter has now been straightened and  
 by-passes the village to the west.    
  The main part of the village has     
 developed along the Stratford Road    
 with a few smaller roads and lanes    
 leading from it.The oldest houses seem
 to date from the seventeenth century  
 although some have parts reputedly    
 earlier than this.                    
  Ettington was originally Upper       
 Ettington, with Lower Ettington       
 centred aruond Ettington Park.The     
 spelling of Ettington has changed over
 the years.As recently as the 1950's it
 was Eatington and was called Eatintone
 for many centuries before that.
