		<title>07A BARNACLE FARMER</title>
		<content>{Park Farm}in the family of the present
 owners since{1921}.It is a dairy      
 farm and the bulk of the land is sown 
 and fertilized grassland.             
 The day starts at 6a.m. with milking  
 and is geared to caring for the       
 livestock.No slack period during the  
 year and the busiest time is from     
 early October onwards as animals are  
 brought in for the winter and require 
 feeding and cleaning out with extra   
 care necessary as calves are born.    
 A good milk cow is currently worth    
 Â£600;an older animal fetchesÂ£450 at   
 slaughter-usually at an abattoir at   
 Crick,Rugby.The farmer found reward in
 3 main areas:-job satisfaction,an open
 air life,and being his own boss.Least 
 desirable aspects of his life were    
 working in all weathers and on every  
 day,including Christmas Day.
