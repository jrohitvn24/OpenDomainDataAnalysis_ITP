		<content>   For many children the school day is 
 very similar to the one described on  
 page 11,they all seemed to follow more
 or less the same routine so we decided
 to look at how children spent their   
 time at the weekends when they had    
 more spare time.Here is one example   
 which was most common.                
   On Saturdays and Sundays we are able
 to stay in bed a little longer.On     
 Saturday I don't get up until eight   
 thirty,I have to get up then because  
 the family goes shopping in           
 Andover.This usually takes most of the
 morning.We come home and have         
 lunch,then if it's fine I go out with 
 my friends and play.If it's wet then I
 usually stop in and watch             
 television,or play in my room.On      
 Sunday most of the family stays in bed
 much longer.
