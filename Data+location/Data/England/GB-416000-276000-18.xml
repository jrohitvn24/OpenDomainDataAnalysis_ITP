 which was built in the 15th Century   
 and restored in 1975. It is situated  
 in the High Street and they have      
 10,000 books. They spend Â£10,000 on   
 books a year. The library often has   
 displays upstairs and art galleries.  
 5000 adults and 2000 children are     
 members of the library. The charge for
 the late books is 4p a day for        
 adults.2p for pensioners and 1p for   
 children. 6 people work in the        
 library. They register a book on a    
 computer system called Plessey. The   
 classification system is called the   
 Duey Decimal system which is a lot of 
 numbers from 1 - 10000. There is a    
 readers club for children and when the
 answer questions from the book they   
 have to read they get so many points  
 and get a badge for every 100 points.
