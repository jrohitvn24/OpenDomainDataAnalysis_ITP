 As Winchester is an{ancient}capital it
 has lots of{local history}and is      
 strewn with old{buildings.}An example 
 is the hospital with its endless      
 Victorian brickwork using burnt black 
 as well as ordinary bricks.Another old
 building is King Alfred's College.It  
 is quite different from the hospital  
 because it uses stone instead of      
 bricks. At the top of the building    
 there are many gargoyles which look as
 if they are just about to jump out at 
 you. It would seem as if most of the  
 old buildings in this area are        
 Victorian. The teacher's centre is    
 about the same age as the hospital,   
 with similar brickwork. It has not    
 always been a teacher's centre. It was
 built as a school and was used as this
 until the new Western school was built
 10 years ago.                         </content>
