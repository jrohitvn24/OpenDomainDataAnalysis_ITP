		<title>12RICHARD SALTER</title>
		<content>  On a Tuesday in June of 1926         
 Richard Salter went to the Bearcroft. 
 It was the custom of the school to let
 the older childen go out sketching.   
 The Bearcroft is an old pond situated 
 about 250 metres from school.Seven    
 boys went out that afternoon. Only six
 returned.                             
  The headteacher usually made         
 frequent checks on the children but   
 did not stay with them all of the     
 time.He was going to check with them  
 when suddenly Willam Sincup came      
 running in shouting  "Rchard Salter   
 is drowning".By the time the          
 headteacher had arrived at the pool   
 the village policeman was also there  
 but no sign could be found of         
 Richard.His body was recovered two    
 hours later, it was found tangled in  
 the weeds.Richard was 13 years old. .
