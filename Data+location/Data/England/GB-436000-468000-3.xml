		<content> When I was invited to Caroline's I    
 found plenty of safety precautions for
 her baby. i saw that there was a guard
 on the fire which was very good for   
 the baby because the room was very    
 small. When Caroline suggested that we
 go upstairs I agreed and we got to the
 door and I noticed that at the top and
 the bottom of the stairs there was a  
 safety guard, to stop Sally climbing  
 up and down the stairs. She showed me 
 into                                  
 sally's room and inside was a cot with
 a safety lock on it which will stop   
 Sally from dropping the side. The     
 medicine was also out of reach. When I
 left I noticed a fence round the      
 garden that would stip Sally getting  
 out on to the road. Sally's Mum had a 
 sterilizer to keep Sally's equipment  
 clean so she doesn't get germs in her 
 food.                                 </content>
