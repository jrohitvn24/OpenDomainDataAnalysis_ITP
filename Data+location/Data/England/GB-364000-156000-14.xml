		<content>{Living in High Littleton by an 8 year 
{old.                                  
  I like living in High Littleton      
 because there's lots of room to       
 play,not by the main roads but in the 
 fields.There are many fields and they 
 are very big.You can play on your     
 bikes up the lanes.There are lots of  
 steep fields where you can go on your 
 toboggan when its snowing.The field we
 go in is very steep and it has got    
 lots of big bumps in it.There are lots
 of my friends in the village.There is 
 a river too,where you can go for      
 walks.There's the woods where you can 
 go for long walks.There are shops near
 by and there are lots of them.There   
 isn't anything really that I don't    
 like about living here.
