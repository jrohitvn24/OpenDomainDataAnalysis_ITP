		<title>06LANHERNE CONVENT</title>
		<content> The Carmelite nuns of Lanherne Convent
 belong to a closed order. When l went 
 to interview them on 3.7.85 a wall    
 separated us and we spoke through     
 grids. The Reverend Mother said that  
 the house was mentioned in the        
 Domesday Book of 1066. The convent was
 founded on 1.5.1519, before this the  
 Arundell family lived there.  The     
 convent has 32 rooms and a chapel     
 which houses the skull of the martyr  
 St.Cuthbert Mayne. There are 12 acres 
 of convent land and a convent farm of 
 70 acres. There are 12 nuns in the    
 convent and their day starts at 5.30am
 and ends at 10.30pm.Most of the day is
 spent in prayer although each nun has 
 housework to do.                      
 The nuns live in total isolation,a    
 lifestyle very different to most      
 people in 1985,committed to their     
 Catholic Religion.                    </content>
