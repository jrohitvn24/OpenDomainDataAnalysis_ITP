		<title>10KNILL'S MONUMENT</title>
		<content>{ Knill's monument}a triangular, hollow
 pyramid on a square base.Built by John
 Knill, collector of customs at St Ives
 from 1762-82 and Mayor in 1767.In 1782
 the monument was built as a mausoleum 
 but was never consecrated and so was  
 never used.{The Knill ceremony, }first
 carried out in 1801, takes place every
 5 years on St. James Day, 25th July.10
 little girls dressed in white, natives
 of the borough and daughters  of      
 seamen, fishermen or tinners not      
 exceeding 10 years of age, accompanied
 by 2 elderly widows and led by a      
 fiddler, go in procession from the    
 Guildhall to the Malakoff.            
  They are then taken by coach to      
 Trelyon and complete the rest of the  
 journey on foot.Here the group dance  
 around the monument to the tune of the
{Cornish Furry Dance.}
