		<title>12ELSTREE VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Elstree lies on the Roman road of     
{Watling Street}which linked London to 
 St. Albans, and was a resting-place   
 for pilgrims visiting the shrine      
 there. Despite pressure from modern   
 traffic, many old cottages - often    
 weather-boarded or tile-hung - remain 
 standing.{"The Holly Bush"}public     
 house dates from the 15th. century    
 while the{Elstree Forge,}although now 
 concentrating on decorative ironwork, 
 provides a vivid link with the past.  
{St. Nicholas' Church,}rebuilt in 1853,
 retains its medieval font. The overall
 impression of Elstree is a linear     
 village comprising a mixture of       
 architectural styles which blend      
 together surprisingly well to create a
 cross-section of history. The dominant
 features, however, are a large housing
 estate to the south and a busy cross- 
 roads at the centre of the village.   </content>
