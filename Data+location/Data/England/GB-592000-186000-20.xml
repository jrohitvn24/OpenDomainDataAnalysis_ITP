		<content> THERE ARE MANY KINDS OF HOUSES. A     
 SEMI-DETACHED HOUSE IS JOINED ON ONE  
 SIDE. A TERRACE HOUSE IS ONE OF A LONG
 LINE OF HOUSES JOINED TOGETHER. A     
 DETACHED HOUSE STANDS BY ITS SELF. ALL
 THESE HOUSES HAVE AT LEAST TWO FLOORS.
 A BUNGELOW HAS ONE. MOST HOUSES HAVE  
 TILE OR SLATE ROOFS. A FEW COTTAGES   
 HAVE THATCHED ROOFS WHICH ARE MADE OF 
 REEDS.SOME PEOPLE LIVE IN FLATS. A    
 FLAT IS A SET OF ROOMS IN A MULTI     
 STOREY BUILDING. MOST HOUSES HAVE GAS 
 AND ELECTRICITY SUPPLIES FOR HEATING, 
 LIGHTING AND COOKING.ALSO IN A HOUSE  
 WE WOULD EXPECT TO GET HOT AND COLD   
 RUNNING WATER. MOST HOUSES HAVE A     
 BATHROOM AND TOILET AND THREE         
 BEDROOMS. THE AVERAGE SIZE FAMILY     
 LIVING IN SUCH A HOUSE WOULD BE THREE 
 OR FOUR.THERE ARE THREE SPECIAL BLOCKS
 OF FLATS WITH WARDENS FOR OLD PEOPLE  
 IN OUR VILLAGE.                       </content>
