		<content>  Although the area is considered to be
 rural only two farms are actually     
 sited within our grid:                
 (a){Repton Road Farm-}32 acres mixed  
 husbandry.Presently farmed by the     
 Woodis family and for the last 50 yrs.
 They have a dairy herd of 58 Fresians 
 and 3 Jersey cows.In addition they    
 have a few sheep with 17 lambs in May 
 1985.In common with local practice    
 mied cereal and fodder crops occupy   
 most of the none pasture land.        
 (b) {Rosemary Farm- }This 14 acre farm
 has been run by the Acres family for  
 the past 38 yrs.It is mainly a chicken
 farm using a 'battery' deep litter    
 process. The bulk of the land is used 
 for cropping of mixed cereals although
 the farmer keeps 18 dairy cowsand 4   
 bulls-beef production.
