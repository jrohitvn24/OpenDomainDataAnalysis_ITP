		<title>16THE COBHAM FELLOWSHIP</title>
		<content> David Taylor, a member of the         
 Fellowship and local historian,       
 said that the Fellowship was started  
 15 years ago by a group of 4 or 5     
 people who were disillusioned with the
 main churches.  Originally intended   
 for Cobham people , they met in one of
 the members' houses. Now there are 300
 members (including children) from many
 parts of Surrey. Every 3 months there 
 is an open meeting in Guildford,      
 drawing people from London and the    
 Home Counties.                        
                                       
                                       
 The Fellowship members want to have a 
 relationship with God through Jesus   
 Christ on a day-to-day basis. As a    
 group they want to share their lives  
 together.                             
                                       
                                       </content>
