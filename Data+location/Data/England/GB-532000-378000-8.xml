		<content>      Although very few people live in 
 the surrounding area, there are many  
 small churches around.  In this       
 particular area there are two, at     
 Burwell and Ruckland.                 
      The church that we went to was   
 called St. Olav's.  It is about 100   
 years old but was rebuilt on the site 
 of a very early church.  There is     
 still part of a Celtic cross to be    
 seen set into one of the walls.  It is
 a tiny church and is now one of       
 a group of parishes which have a      
 rotation of services.  Although the   
 regular services are badly attended,  
 there is a lot of local support and   
 interest.  An annual flower festival  
 is always well supported.             
      The larger and older church in   
 Burwell has been made redundant.
