           {Haunted House}             
 One of the oldest houses in the area  
 has a history dating back to the first
 Domesday Book.We visited the present  
 owners who told us of their "ghostly" 
 sounds.Long ago a famous family were  
 desperate to have children who lived  
 there.                                
   A visting child recently was playing
 in one of the bedrooms when the childs
 mother checked on the child who was   
 bouncing on the bed.She returned to   
 the livin room to ask "who was that   
 woman with the dark brown curly       
 hair playing with the child?"Everyone 
 was surprised because it was only the 
 child upstairs.A number of visitors   
 have seen and felt a friendly presence
 in one of the bedrooms, people think  
 the connection between the ghost and  
 house relates to children.            </content>
