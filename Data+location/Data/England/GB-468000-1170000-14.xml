 with the load for both shops. One shop
 keeper moves his stores from the boat 
 to the shop with a{wheelbarrow.}The   
 other moves her stores with a{tractor 
{and trailer}and some times with a{car.
                                       
 Something else that comes on the boat 
 is the{mail.}We get our mail at night 
 at the same time as the stuff comes to
 the shop. We only get mail on Tuesday 
 and Friday and we put out mail on the 
 same days. Our Post Office is in a    
 garden shed next to the council       
 houses.
