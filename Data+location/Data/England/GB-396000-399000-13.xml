		<title>13MOSSLEY CARNIVAL</title>
		<content> The annual Mossley Charity Carnival   
 was held on Saturday, 25th May 1985.  
 The children and parents of           
 Micklehurst Community Junior School   
 gathered in school at 9.00 am to      
 decorate the lorry supplied by Dolan's
 Containers of Stalybridge. Decorations
 from the school pantomime, Snow White 
 and the Several Dwarfs, had been saved
 and by 12.00 the lorry was ready to   
 set off for the Market ground in Top  
 Mossley for the judging. After a      
 hair-raising drive ( the driver was   
 late ), 25 excited children found they
 had  won first prize in the School's  
 section and happily joined the parade 
 on its journey through the town to the
 Carnival ground on Egmont Street      
 playing fields, Micklehurst. The      
 parade was over a mile long with      
 bands and floats representing groups  
 from all over Greater Manchester.     </content>
