		<title>05BROOKLANDS GARAGE,EAST WALL</title>
		<content> This is the only garage in our D.Block
 it is a filling station with          
 mechanical servicing facilities.We    
 serve all grades of petrol and oils   
 but this is not a money-making service
 it does bring customers in though.We  
 carry out repairs to all types of     
 vehicles and the customers come from a
 wide area.We are licenced to do M.O.T.
 testing,which by law has to be carried
 out on every three-year old{car}and   
 then every 12 months thereafter.This  
 is a complete {safety}check on the    
 vehicle and if it is not 100% correct 
 the certificate will not be issued and
 the car cannot be driven until put    
 right.As {petrol}is becoming more     
 expensive,the manufacturers are       
 producing more efficient engines,and  
 more steamlined bodywork.The owner and
 one assistant mechanic work at the    
 garage.                               </content>
