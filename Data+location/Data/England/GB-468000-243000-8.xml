		<content>On Thursday, 23rd May 1985, I got up at
8 o'clock.  It was a bright day.  I had
a wash, dressed and ate a breakfast of 
cereal, toast and juice.  Dad took me  
and my brother to school at 8.45.      
After the register we listened to a    
schools service broadcast.  During     
lessons I did Maths Adventure and      
Spell-well.  At playtime we played on  
climbing frames.  I did a handwriting  
card and a science card before lunch.  
School lunch was cheese pie, chips and 
tomatoes, followed by a biscuit and a  
drink.  In the afternoon I read to a   
helper then our teacher read us "The   
Day Jean-Pierre Went Round The World"  
by Paul Gallico.  I had my violin      
lesson then went home at 4 o'clock.  I 
played and watched television.  We had 
tea of sausages, potatoes and beans,   
then apple pie. At 8p.m. I bathed then 
read in bed.                           </content>
