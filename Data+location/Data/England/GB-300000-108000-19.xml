		<title>19SCHOOL IN THE PRESENT</title>
		<content> The present school was built in 1948. 
 There are 120 people in four classes. 
 Most people walk to school,only a few 
 of them go by car or cycle.           
 If you're naughty you stay in at play 
 time or miss your swimming .Most      
 people have school dinners,a quarter  
 have packed lunch and the remainder go
 home.                                 
 Sometimes we have P.E in the hall .   
 We have got a horse,stool,climbing    
 frame  and plank.Also we have a       
 swimming pool which we use every      
 summer.We hold 2 sport days every     
 year,one is a school sport day,the    
 other is one for all the schools in   
 the Culm Valley.The school is also    
 lucky enough to have a                
 computer,T.V,&amp; video.When you are 11  
 you can go to Uffculme by car or      
 Cullompton by bus.
