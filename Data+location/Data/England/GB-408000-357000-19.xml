     The Manifold Show is an annual    
agricultural show and is held at       
Archford Moor Farm, Hulme End on the

      Shops in the area have           
exhibitions of their farm machinery    
for people to look at and buy. There

machines.

of stalls, take-away food and drink    
outlets and other small attractions.
