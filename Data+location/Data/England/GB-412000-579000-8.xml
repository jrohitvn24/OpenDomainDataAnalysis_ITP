		<title>08WEST LOW HOUSE FARM, WHALTON</title>
		<content> This farm of 96 ares plus 100 acres of
 rented land is run by a manager as a  
 dairy unit. They keep 120 Fresian x   
 Holsteins as well as 70 heifers. The  
 farm has a 14-14 herringbone milking  
 parlour which is computerised and     
 automatically delivers the correct    
 amount of food for each cow. The cows 
 are milked twice a day during the     
 summer but three times a day from     
 October to May when they are kept in  
 and fed on silage. About 70 acres are 
 used for silage with 50 acres of      
 winter wheat, fodder beet and peas.   
 The average field size is 12 acres and
 the farm has 3 tractors and a forage  
 box for feeding. The unit is run by 1 
 man at the moment although until      
 recently there were 2.
