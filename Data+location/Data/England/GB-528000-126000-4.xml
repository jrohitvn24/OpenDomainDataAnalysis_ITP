		<content> The land of this area is used mainly  
 for mixed farming, with pastureland   
 and fields,divided by hedgerows and   
 some patches of deciduous woodland.   
 There are also some new plantings of  
 conifers. This environment supports   
 quite a wide variety of bird life. One
 of the local residents has studied the
 birds in the area,and as well as the  
 more common ones, which include Robins
 ,Wrens ,Tits,Blackbirds,Starlings,    
 Rooks,Crows and Pigeons, he has seen  
 Green Woodpeckers, Greater Spotted    
 Woodpeckers,Woodcock,Tree Creepers,   
 Nuthatches,Tree Pippits, Sparrow Hawks
 and Tawney Owls. During the past few  
 years there has been a resurgence in  
 the Little Owl population,and there   
 are several pairs in the area.
