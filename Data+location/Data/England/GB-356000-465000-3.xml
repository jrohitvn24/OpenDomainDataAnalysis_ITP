		<content>Land management:6-8acres of rough      
pasture are reclaimed per year by      
tiling and draining.The land has to be 
limed every third year.30 acres        
of woodland provide fence posts and act
as shelter belts.Trees mainly planted  
are evergreens.They are replaced as    
they are cut.Planning permission is re-
quired for new woodland.Field bound-   
aries are stone walls as it is too ex- 
posed for hedges.Reclaimed land has    
wire fences which give no shelter to   
stock.A syndicate rents shooting rights
to shoot pheasant grouse and other     
game.50 brace of grouse and 800        
pheasants are shot per annum at a cost 
of 1000 pounds.At each shoot lots are  
drawn to allocate shooting butts.
