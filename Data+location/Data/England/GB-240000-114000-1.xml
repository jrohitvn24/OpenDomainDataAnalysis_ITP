		<content> The area consists of farming in the   
 East and arable land in the West, with
 sections of copicing and an area of   
 Limited habitation.  It has large     
 heath and moorland and a small        
 wetland.  Occupations are farming and 
 allied trades.                        
 There is abundant wildlife, with a    
 preponderance of badgers and rabbits, 
 the latter affected by Myxomatosis.   
 The district has five parishes -      
 Langtree, Frithelstock, Bulkworthy,   
 Newton St. Petrock and Shebbear. Local
 plans provide of the building of a    
 substantial number of houses at Stibb 
 Cross, where the majority of homes are
 owner-occupied. Dwellings are mainly  
 cob-built Devon longhouses, once      
 thatched but now slate-roofed.
