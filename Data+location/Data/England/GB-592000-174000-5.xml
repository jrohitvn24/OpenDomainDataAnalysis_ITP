		<title>05House Improvements-Sheerness</title>
		<content>   In about 1982, after a survey was   
 done by Kent University, part of      
 Sheerness was designated an "action   
 area" by the{government.              
   The area stretches from Marine      
 Parade to Unity Street and includes   
 mostly terraced{housing}dating from   
 the late 19th century.                
   They were designated as such because
 they had no bathrooms and the findings
 of the report revealed that nearly 70%
 were on the{poverty}line.             
   As an "action area"{Home Improvement
{Grants}were funded direct from central
 government and ranged from 30% to 90%.
   One lady interviewed said she was   
 given a 60% grant on Â£7,000 worth of  
 improvements.These included a new roof
 and supports,new bathroom and toilet  
 (previously outdoor),guttering,doors, 
  windows and a replacement kitchen.The
 house was rewired and damp proofed.   </content>
