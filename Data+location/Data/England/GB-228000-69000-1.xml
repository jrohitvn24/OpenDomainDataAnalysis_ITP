		<title>01Our Area.</title>
		<content> Our area is situated to the east of   
{Caradon Hill,}an area of granite rock 
 and moorland over one thousand feet   
 high. The area slopes quite steeply   
 down into the ualley of the{River     
{Lynher.}The lower  slopes are quite   
 heavily wooded but the tree_cover     
 decreases as you get higher. The land 
 is mostly used for a mixture of dairy,
 beef and sheep farming so has smallish
 fields bordered by high hedges.       
 Throughout the landscape are isolated 
 farms and cottages  built of local    
 stone. The centre of population is the
 village of{Pensilva.}The old village  
 is surrounded by modern housing       
 estates, mostly bungalows. Nearly all 
 the shops, services and meeting places
 are here such as churches, halls,     
 school, health centre and public      
 house.
