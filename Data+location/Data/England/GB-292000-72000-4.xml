		<title>04THE DAILY DIARY OF MY DAD</title>
		<content> At 6.55am my dad wakes up to our      
 Teasmade and musical alarm. Then he   
 pours out the tea for my mum and      
 himself. At 7.55am he rises to have a 
 shower and gets dressed into a suit.  
 Then he starts to prepare the family  
 breakfasts. My dad's consists of fruit
 juice, cereal and toast then he cleans
 his teeth. At 8.10 he leaves home to  
 travel to Exeter in a car. He is a    
 regional surveyor and sometimes       
 travels throughout the Westcountry to 
 numerous branches. He works till      
 lunchtime but at 10.15 tea or coffee  
 is brought round by his receptionist. 
 He has a brief lunch break which      
 consists of chips or salad and works  
 to 6 O'clock. He arrives back home and
 has a large evening meal made by my   
 mum. Then he watches television or    
 works in the garden. At 11.30pm he    
 goes to bed.                          </content>
