{LAND USE-FORESTRY                     
 As mentioned in the general review a  
 large portion of our area is covered  
 by forest.This forest is called       
 Delamere Forest.The name means forest 
 of the meres,&amp; is actually 2400 acres 
 in size.(970 hectares).It is the only 
 remaining area of the great Mara &amp;    
 Mondrum forests,used in Norman times  
 as a hunting ground by the Earls of   
 Chester.The topography has been       
 altered by glacial activity which     
 formed deep holes creating the present
 day meres &amp; mosses.                   
 Delamere is the management centre for 
 the Cheshire Forest District &amp; from   
 here the Manager &amp; his 30 foresters   
 control forest operations,give advice 
 to private woodland owners &amp; act as   
 plant health inspectors for imported  
 timber.                               </content>
