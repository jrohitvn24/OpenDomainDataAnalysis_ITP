		<content> All of the many people interviewed in 
 the three villages agreed on several  
 points,that they enjoyed living in the
 countryside for its beauty,peace and  
 fresh air.They didn't like being      
 snowed-in during winter.Many are      
 retired but there are younger people  
 moving into the area ,one who has     
 recently moved to Leer is a Beekeeper 
 and is setting up a thriving cottage  
 industry.We were fortunate enough to  
 meet in each of the three villages    
 ladies who had lived there all their  
 lives.They had seen many changes.The  
 biggest was the connection of         
 electricity and mains water supplies. 
 They have adjusted to modern life and 
 the gradually changing villages but   
 look back with fond memories of       
 yesteryear of fetes,garden parties,the
 now-closed village schools and fields 
 where mushrooms could be picked .     </content>
