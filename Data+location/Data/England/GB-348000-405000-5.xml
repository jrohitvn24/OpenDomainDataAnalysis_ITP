		<title>05UPHOLLAND COLLEGE</title>
		<content> This College is the only{Roman        
{Catholic Junior Seminary}in England.  
 Its grounds cover 263 acres and       
 include farmland, playing fields and a
 golf course.                          
 The land was bought by Bishop O'Reilly
 in 1877 for Â£8000 and the building is 
 built from local stone. It opened in  
 1883. In 1923 extensions were needed  
 and in 1930 a fine chapel was built   
 while in 1936 the staff built their   
 own gym.                              
 The College educates boys to 'A' level
 standard and they then go to Senior   
 Seminaries in England, Ireland or     
 Rome.                                 
 The Upholland Northern Institute is   
 housed in the same building and runs  
 adult Christian education courses and 
 acts as a conference and retreat      
 centre. Archbishop Derek Warlock is   
 committed to its continued existence. </content>
