		<title>05BREDON'S NORTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content>{Bredon's Norton}is a small village on 
 the side of{Bredon Hill}but it has    
 grown in the last 60 years.{The Manor 
{House}is very old.This year it cele-  
 brated its 400th anniversary and we   
 did{Maypole Dances}at their celebrat- 
 ions.The Post Office has shut down but
 it has re-opened in a shed near the   
{Church.}Now the Post Office only opens
 in the afternoon.The church is{Norman.
 We walked around the village.There are
 a few thatched houses but not many.The
 Village Hall used to be a school.It is
 like our school only it is much, much 
 smaller.It has a Bell Tower like ours 
 and it had some writing over the door.
 It says 'As the twig is bent so the   
 tree inclines.'It means that if the   
 teacher is kind to you you grow up to 
 be kind to other people.We enjoyed our
 walk around the village, there are    
 some very nice houses in it.          </content>
