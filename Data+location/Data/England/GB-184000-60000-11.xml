 Mr. Hicks did farm 85 acres but now   
 has only 20 acres, keeping bullocks   
 and growing corn, hay,and potatoes.The
 main machinery used includes tracters,
 ploughs, rollers, cultivators         
 rotavators and planters which are     
 owned.                                
 Tregenna camp site has been open since
 1953. People use caravans more then   
 tents as they are so convenient for   
 a holiday.  At the camp site they have
 many facilities such as three swimming
 pools,a disco,shops,amusements,golf,  
 toilets,telephones and T.V.  The camp 
 site covers 26.5 acres, and it costs  
 Â£149 per week to stay there in July   
 and Â£169 in Agust,which is the peak   
 holiday period. People stay there for 
 a week on average.
