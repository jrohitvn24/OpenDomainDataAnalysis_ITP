		<title>02THE MALTINGS, THORPE</title>
		<content> The Maltings were built in 1895 and   
 the place was chosen because there    
 aren't many people around. While malt 
 is being made it smells a bit, so its 
 better not to be near people. Another 
 reason was the railway is next to it  
 for taking it to the breweries. Being 
 in East Anglia, this is where all the 
 barley is grown from which the malt   
 is made. There are 5 people employed  
 at the Thorpe_le_Soken Maltings and   
 the firm is the biggest employer in   
 the village. The firm is part of a    
 brewery company and the malt goes to  
 their own breweries in Romford,Burton 
 and Wrexham.Nowadays the malt goes by 
 lorry not by rail.It used to be loaded
 on in sacks but now it goes in bulk by
 road. There are a lot of maltings in  
 places like Ipswich and Bury St.      
 Edmunds because East Anglia is such a 
 good place for barley.                </content>
