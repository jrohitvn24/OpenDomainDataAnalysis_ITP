		<title>20A TEENAGER'S VIEWPOINT.</title>
		<content>  " FORTON BEING A SMALL VILLAGE, HAS  
 NOTHING FOR TEENAGE INTEREST. THERE   
 ARE NO SHOPS OR LITTLE STORES, SO NO  
 FOOD DRINK OR BITS AND PIECES CAN BE  
 BOUGHT. IT IS ONLY TWO MILES TO       
 NEWPORT, BUT WITHOUT TRANSPORT IT IS A
 LONG DISTANCE.                        
   THE ONLY ENTERTAINMENT IS FORTON    
 LODGE, THE DISCOTEQUE WHICH IS FOR    
 OVER 18's. NEXT TO THE LODGE THERE IS 
 THE OLD SWAN INN, BUT ONCE AGAIN NOT  
 FOR MY AGE GROUP.                     
   THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH CHILDREN TO    
 FORM  A YOUTH CLUB, THERE ARE 18 IN   
 ALL, 5 OF WHO ARE UNDER THE AGE OF    
 TEN. TO ME, I FIND FORTON IS BORING   
 AND INCONVENIENT FOR MY PARENTS, WHO  
 HAVE TO TAKE ME ANYWHERE I WANT TO    
 GO."                                  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
