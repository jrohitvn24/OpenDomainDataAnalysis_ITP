 Due to the rural aspect of the        
 area,the next question we felt would  
 be relevant was:{Do you work in or out
{of the area?.}As we thought the       
 majority of workers did work out of   
 the area.Of the 60 forms,35 had people
 working out of the area.Eleven worked 
 in the area,10 were retired and 4 were
 out of work.                          
 Because of the lack of a good bus     
 service in the area,we thought it     
 would be interesting to enquire how   
 the people got to work.Of the 50      
 workers,31 went by car,10 on foot,8 by
 M'cycle and 1 by van.                 </content>
