		<title>02AERODROME AND R.A.F.HENDON</title>
		<content>   Claude Grahame White established    
 Hendon Aerodrome in 1910.Many famous  
 flights started at Hendon Aerodrome   
 including the first long distance     
 flight and the first night flight.The 
 first aerial post started at Hendon   
 and ended at Windsor with mail for    
 His Majesty the King George V.Grahame 
 White also had an aeroplane factory at
 Hendon.The main function of RAF Hendon
 today is JSATC Joint Services Air     
 Trooping Centre which deals with the  
 movement of service personnel from the
 United Kingdom to stations in foreign 
 countries. We dont know how many      
 people work at RAF Hendon as the      
 information cannot be disclosed for   
 security reasons.The last time        
 an aeroplane took off from Hendon     
 was in 1957 and  the aerodrome was    
 finally closed  down because modern   
 aircraft needed longer runways.       </content>
