		<title>08St.Andrew's Church,OLD</title>
		<content>  The Church in Old is situated in the 
 centre of the village close to the    
 Public House.It has a square tower.   
  There is Holy Communion every Sunday 
 and Evensong once per month.          
  The structure of the church is in    
 poor repair and a major fund raising  
 scheme is underway.About Â£8000 is     
 needed to repair crumbling stonework  
 on the south walls.It is hoped to get 
 a grant from the Department of the    
 Environment for part of this but      
 around Â£5000 must come from fund      
 raising.                              
  A{Flower Festival}is held annually   
 in July in the church and the proceeds
 go to the fund, as do those from the  
 annual{Fete}.                         
  The church is important to about 30% 
 of the village,but few attend services
 regularly.                            
                                       </content>
