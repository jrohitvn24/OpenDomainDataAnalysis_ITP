		<title>03PIG FARMING IN BURTON PIDSEA</title>
		<content>           MANOR FARM                  
     Manor Farm has 5816 pigs at the   
 present time.                         
     The pigs are arranged in pens     
 according to age and size.            
     Sows weigh, on average, 300 pounds
 whilst piglets weigh only 3 pounds at 
 birth. They are usually kept with the 
 mother for three weeks.               
     When the piglets are born they    
 have to be de-tailed and have their   
 teeth clipped. This is to stop them   
 from hurting the mother when feeding. 
 They also have to have an             
 identification number put in their    
 ear.                                  
     Piglets are usually born in very  
 large litters and some are born dead. 
 Others die soon after birth. Sometimes
 the mother is clumsy and she lays on a
 piglet. To avoid this, the sow is held
 in her pen by movable bars.           </content>
