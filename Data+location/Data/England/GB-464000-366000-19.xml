		<title>19A Village Divided-Ollerton</title>
		<content>    As has been indicated previously,  
{Ollerton/New Ollerton}is essentially  
 the centre of this particular survey  
 area.It is also one village of two    
 diverse histories and characters.     
 During the{miners' strike of 1984-5   
 the village was subject to activities 
 which produced another kind of split. 
    The majority of Nottinghamshire    
 miners were not on strike,but the     
 small ranks of Ollerton strikers were 
 often supplemented by flying pickets  
 from other parts of the country. This 
 led to a massive police presence in an
 attempt to keep peace. However,police,
 pickets and working miners were       
 involved in several violent clashes.  
 The worst of these led to the death of
 a young Yorkshire miner.              
      The dispute has led to a split   
 between striking/working miners, which
 may take many years to heal,if ever.  </content>
