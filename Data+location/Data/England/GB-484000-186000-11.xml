		<title>11Playing Squash in Marlow</title>
		<content>     The Oasis Squash Club,{Marlow}was 
 built in 1977. They thought of the    
 name Oasis because it stood in the    
 middle of an industrial estate, almost
 in the middle of nowhere.{Susan Devoy}
 has played there sometimes. She is the
 women's number one squash player in   
 the world. The Oasis club has six     
 courts and 31 staff. There is not a   
 fixed age that you have to be to play 
 squash. There was once a young child  
 of four playing and another was a man 
 of seventy! They have had no break-ins
 or spraying on the walls. They have a 
 sport's shop but they are going to do 
 away with it because it is not doing  
 enough trade.                         
     They have held a competition which
 attracted men from all over the world.
 They came from Singapore and          
 Australia. It was won by a man called 
 David Lloyd aged 19.                  </content>
