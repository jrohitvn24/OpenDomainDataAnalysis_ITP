		<content> BATH : TRAFFIC PROBLEM. Bath is famous
 for its Georgian buildings and Roman  
 remains but, probably not so well     
 known for its traffic problem.The main
 problem is the city centre but it     
 extends to our survey area which is   
 bisected by principal roads where the 
 majority of buildings were built. When
 these streets were originally planned 
 no one dreamt that the flow and type  
 of traffic would be what it is in     
 1985.In 1964 car ownership in Bath was
 14,000 that is 170 people per car. In 
 1985 the figure is closer to 50 people
 per car.
