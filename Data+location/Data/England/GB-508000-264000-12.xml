		<title>12INTERVIEW WITH FARMER</title>
		<content>{  Mr.Campion}farms 230 acres arable   
 land about \ mile off the main        
 Kimbolton to Gt.Staughton Road at     
 Gimbers End. Mr.Campion &amp; his wife &amp;  
 teenage son &amp; daughter moved into the 
 farmhouse when his father left about 4
 years ago. A row of several farm      
 cottages were converted to form the   
 present house. Mr.Campion works the   
 farm apart from occassional help from 
 one local man.He owns a combine,      
 tractors, sprayer, beet harvester,    
 silos &amp; corn dryer. 160 acres are     
 wheat, 25 barley, 10 hedges roads &amp;   
 river &amp; on the remainder he grows     
 sugarbeet, radish, parsnip, turnip &amp;  
 evening primrose for seed.            
   90% of the grain is sold for animal 
 food. The EEC grain buying scheme led 
 to an increase in acreage of grain    
 from 10% to 50%.
