{Cairman of the World Wildlife Fund. } 
 He moved there in 1972 and started    
 keeping rare breeds of sheep like the{
{Wiltshire Horn},then 2 llamas ,2 emus 
 and a pair of zebra. He has liked     
 animals since he was a child. Now he  
 and his staff have about 102 rare or  
 exotic birds and animals many are     
 endangered species. Sometimes he helps
 other zoos by lending animals for     
 breeding. He wants to educate people  
 more about endangered species. A      
 century ago there were only 14{       
{Przewalsky horses}alive ,now there are
 400. The ones we saw had pet names.   
 There are tapirs, llamas, pigmy goats,
{Grevy zebra},cranes, rheas, alpacas,  
 Jacobs sheep, snowy owls, long eared  
 owls, white owls,wallabies. Prettiest 
 of all were the{Chinese water bucks}.
