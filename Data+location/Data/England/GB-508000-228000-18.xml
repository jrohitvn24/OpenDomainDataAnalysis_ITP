		<title>18Rearing Birds for Sport</title>
		<content>{Pheasants and partridges}are specially
 reared for sport on the{Hexton Manor  
{Estate.}After the eggs are laid they  
 are taken from the mother and go into 
 an incubator for 30 days. When they   
 hatch the chicks are feed on pellets  
 and lettuce for several weeks. Then   
 they are fed on corn. When they are   
 used to corn they are released into   
 large pens. They can get out of these 
 and return for shelter and food in the
 summer. Many leave the pens until     
 autumn when a lot of them are shot for
 sport. Some of these are sold to be   
 eaten. The rest are kept by the       
 shooters to eat, and the beaters are  
 given some as their reward for sending
 the birds into the path of the        
 shooters. The survivors are kept      
 alive to breed for next season.
