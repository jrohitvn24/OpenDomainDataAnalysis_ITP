		<title>12CRIME IN BELLSHILL</title>
		<content>    In the past ten years there have   
 been few major crimes in              
 Bellshill.There was one case of rape, 
 the perpetrator of which was arrested,
 and the murder of Lorna Porter.This   
 murder is as yet unsolved.            
    The most common type of crime in   
 Bellshill is vandalism- the smashing  
 of windows, writing on walls, the     
 wrecking of gardens, trains,          
 buses.Schools wewre broken into on a  
 number of occasions and valuable      
 equipment stolen or damaged.          
    The average age of the people      
 committing these crimes is 12 - 18    
 years.This crme rate amongst the young
 people is attributed to the problems  
 of adolescence, that these crimes are 
 being committed to draw the attention 
 of the older folks to their needs     
 The Crime rate has risen 15% in two   
 years.                                </content>
