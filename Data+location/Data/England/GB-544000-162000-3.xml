		<content>Orpington Hospital was built by the    
Canadians in the First World War to    
treat injured soldiers.Sir Alexander   
Fleming,who discovered penicillin in   
1928,did some of his work there.During 
the Second World War it was used for   
treating the wounded.In 1969 attempts  
were made to close the hospital but,   
after petitions to the Department of   
Health and Social Security,it was      
saved.About 9 million pounds was spent 
on the new Canada Wing,which has a     
computer for record-keeping.The        
Ontario Centre is a training centre for
doctors and nurses. The fight goes on  
to keep the Casualty Department open   
for 12 hours a day,and to start Phase  
2 of the building programme.           
The area is adequately served by       
doctors and dentists.There is one old  
people's home,and a weekly baby clinic.
