		<title>16A Walk Near Burmarsh</title>
		<content>   We walked along the Lower Wall Road 
 with high ground on our right, and    
 flat land running down towards the sea
 on our left. Lympne Castle was        
 silhouetted on the skyline, and on the
 ridge there were clumps of blue-green 
 trees, some turning yellow, for autumn
 was approaching. The grey stones of   
 Stutfall Castle lay on the green      
 slopes, and on the flat land there    
 were sheep and black and white cattle.
 The trees in the lane were red with   
 haws, and on the other side of a low  
 hedge there was dark, newly ploughed  
 soil. Ducks and geese called from the 
 canal, and the sounds carried in the  
 cool air. Rushes bent and rustled in  
 the ditches and the great grey-blue   
 bowl of the sky covered us.
