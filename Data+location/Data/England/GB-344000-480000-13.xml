		<content>{Storth}is a lively village community  
 with a number of annual events. In    
 June there is a village fete with     
 stalls, displays, fun sports and a    
 Gala Queen. An annual Horticultural   
 Show is held in the village hall, with
 cups and prizes given for various     
 classes, including homegrown fruit and
 vegetables, and handicrafts.          
 The estuary provides its own events.  
 High tides cut off the road along the 
 promenade causing motorists long      
 diversions or even longer waits.      
 Locals watch to see if any will be    
 unwise enough to attempt to make it   
 through the floods, and to render     
 assistance to those stranded by their 
 own impatience. Extreme cold in winter
 produces spectacular iceflows sailing 
 majestically down the estuary.        
 February 1985 provided some of the    
 best for many years.                  </content>
