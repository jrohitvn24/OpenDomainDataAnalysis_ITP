		<title>10W.Ashby Sand &amp; Gravel quarry</title>
		<content> Excavating sand and gravel began at   
 Furzehills in 1942, and it was        
 transported in its excavated state to 
 aerodromes in the area.In 1944 equip- 
 ment for washing the sand from the    
 gravel was installed and this is still
 in use today.More recent equipment    
 includes two sand graders, giving soft
 and sharp textures.The gravel is      
 graded by series of rotating drums,one
 inside the other,which have graded    
 holes in them.Between 700-1,000 tons  
 of sand and gravel are excavated in a 
 week, the mixture being approximately 
 half and half.Although the quarry     
 supplied a ready mixed concrete firm  
 at one time,customers now are mainly  
 local builders.The pit is almost      
 worked out but a few pockets of sand  
 should give four years work.There are 
 seven full time and two part time     
 staff.                                </content>
