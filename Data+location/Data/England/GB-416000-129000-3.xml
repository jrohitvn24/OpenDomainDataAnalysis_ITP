		<content>{The present church was built in 1858  
 on the site of a much earlier church, 
 which dated back prior to the building
 of the cathedral of New Sarum.All that
 is left of the original building, is  
 the ivy covered buttress in the south 
 west part of the churchyard. When it  
 was constructed for about Â£2500, the  
 designer T.H. Wyatt was keen to use as
 much of this original building as     
 possible which had some architectural 
 merit.{The Norman Arch porch entrance 
{is original.}The well known Norman    
 'zig zag' pattern on arches is to be  
 clearly seen. Two of the windows in   
 the West and South West have pieces of
{genuine 13c grisaille glass}which it  
 is believed to have come{from the     
{Cathedral of New Sarum.}The church is 
 well supported today as it was over   
 the centuries past back through to the
 Reformation and before that.          </content>
