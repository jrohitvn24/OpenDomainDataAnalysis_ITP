		<content> There is a shooting club in           
 Godmanchester called{Huntingdon       
{District Shooting Association.}It is  
 25 years old. It has 50 members. You  
 may join when you are 18. They go     
 shooting all the year round. They     
 shoot at{clay pigeons.}Clay pigeons   
 are round. They can be black, orange  
 or white. The white and orange ones   
 are for the evening. To get the clay  
 pigeons from the trap, the man or     
 woman shouts "Pull!" When it is the   
 shooting season they are allowed to   
 shoot real birds like pheasants and   
 grouse. They can shoot pigeons and    
 rats all the year because they are    
 vermin. People have to get a licence  
 before they may own a gun. They mostly
 use a 12 bore under and over which    
 fires cartridges.
