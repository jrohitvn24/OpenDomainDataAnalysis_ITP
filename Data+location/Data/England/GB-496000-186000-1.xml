     This block of squares is on the   
dip slope of the Chilterns, close to   
London, and just north of the River    
Thames. The M40 motorway runs          
diagonally across the block from SE to 
NW.                                    
     There is an extensive gravel      
extraction and landfill area in the NW 
of the block, and Bulstrode house in   
the NE of the block. Much of the NE    
corner is occupied by a part of        
Gerrards Cross, which consists mainly  
of expensive detached housing.         
     The green southern part of the    
block is farmland, both arable and     
pastoral. In the middle of this green  
area is the rather scattered village   
of Hedgerley.
