		<content> My dad is one of the farmers in the   
 area. Our farm is a mixed farm which  
 means that we grow arable crops and   
 raise cattle for milk. My dad gets up 
 each day at 7.00 a.m., has a cup of   
 tea and then goes out to milk the cows
 who will need milking again in the    
 middle of the afternoon. Throughout   
 the year jobs on the farm vary but    
 when the weather is dry he likes to   
 work outside in the fields and when it
 is wet he works indoors.              
  In January and February he ploughs   
 the fields and in March,April and May 
 he plants the seeds and as the crops  
 grow he sprays them to protect them   
 from pests and diseases. In June and  
 into July he cuts the grass for Hay   
 and in August the corn is cut and     
 straw gathered in.During September and
 October the potatoes are harvested.My 
 dad works very hard and we all help.  </content>
