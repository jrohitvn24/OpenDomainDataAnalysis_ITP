		<content> Colostrum in the mother's milk is     
 essential to the calf because it      
 contains antibodies vital to the      
 calf's survival. My wife feeds the    
 calves in the morning and evening. We 
 keep the heifer calves as             
 replacements, but the bul calves are  
 sold to a neighbouring farmer. The    
 calves are fed by bucket for two      
 months before weaning.                
                                       
 The evening milking starts at 4.30    
 p.m. and I usually get in for tea at  
 about 7.00 p.m. Later in the evening I
 have a last look round the cows and   
 give them their final feed of cow nuts
 for the day.(continued)
