		<content> Wednesday 3rd July I woke up in my    
 bed.My bed is made of pine.A mattress 
 goes over the bit where I sleep and a 
 sheet goes over the mattress.A quilt  
 covers me and my head rests on a      
 pillow.I had my breakfast.Then at 8.45
 I went  to school.At 11.55 we went    
 downstairs to wash our hands for      
 lunch.After lunch we had sportsday.I  
 was in three races.I liked the        
 obstacle race best.After sports       
 we went in to change.Later that day we
 were talking about sportsday whilst we
 were having tea.For tea we were having
 salad, pork pie and ham.Then I had to 
 go upstairs to run the bath.After we  
 had washed ourselves we got out of the
 bath and got dried. I put on my       
 night dress  then I got into bed and  
 said my prayers.Then I fell asleep.
