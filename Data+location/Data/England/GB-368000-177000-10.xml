		<title>10THE ABATTOIR AT WESTERLEIGH</title>
		<content>  Built in 1980,the{abattoir}provides  
 work for 110 people. Most workers live
 in{Bristol}but some come from Cardiff 
 and Cornwall.Cows,pigs,sheep and goats
 are{slaughtered painlessly.}Pigs,sheep
 and goats are killed by two men.One   
 gives an electric shock with tongs and
 a second man slits their throats.     
 Cattle are led through a corridor     
 where they are killed with a bolt gun 
 in the head.Afterwards a gate opens   
 and the cows fall out,being  picked up
 on a metal hook and their throats     
 slit.{Pakistani}people hold a special 
 ceremony before their goats are       
 slaughtered.Some of the animal guts   
 and hoofs are used for{fertilizer     
 and meat sent out to the butcher trade
 in this country.Some meat is sent     
 abroad to France,Belgium,Germany even 
 Egypt.
