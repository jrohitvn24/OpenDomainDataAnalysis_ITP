		<title>15 WILDLIFE ALONG THE COAST</title>
		<content>  On Thursday 4th July Form 1 girls,   
Mrs Bennett and Mrs Coward went to     
Labrador Bay and walked back to school.
The minibus gave us a lift to the Bay. 
  The walk was quite interesting, it   
took us through a field with cows in   
it, a golf course and a path which was 
almost covered over with bracken,      
stinging nettles, brambles and quite a 
few wild flowers. The view was lovely  
locking over the sea, there were boats 
going out - fishing boats and speed    
boats.                                 
  We made a list of all that we saw,   
these included birds, trees, insects   
and flowers.                           
  BIRDS: Skylark, robin, thrush, black-
bird, swallow sparrow and magpie.      
  TREES: Cypress, oak, sycamore, holly,
hawthorn and ash.                      
  INSECTS: Blackbeetle.                
                                       </content>
