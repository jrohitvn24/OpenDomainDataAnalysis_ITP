		<content> 20 RESIDENTS OF MANY YEARS STANDING   
 WERE INTERVIEWED. 8 WERE OVER 80 YEARS
 OLD, (THE OLDEST 93). LIVING THROUGH  
 TIMES OF GREAT CHANGES LEFT THEM SORRY
 ABOUT THE EFFECTS THE CHANGES HAVE HAD
 UPON THE LOCALITY. RAPID INCREASES IN 
 NUMBERS OF HOMES AND PEOPLE LEFT THEM 
 REGRETTING THE LOSS OF CLOSE COMMUNITY
 LIFE WHEN THE VILLAGES WERE ALMOST    
 SELF SUFFICIENT FOR SHOPPING WORK AND 
 FUN. MONEY WAS SHORT, HOUSEWORK HARD  
 AND ENTERTAINMENT SELF MADE. TRIPS TO 
 NORWICH, OFTEN ON FOOT, WERE RARE. THE
 ARRIVAL OF MAINS POWER, WATER AND     
 DRAINS WAS WELCOME BUT AT A COST, IN  
 THAT IT HELPED GROWTH. THE GENERAL    
 FEELING OF THE ELDERLY RESIDENTS OF   
 THE VILLAGE WAS SUMMED UP BY ONE,     
 "WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG YOU KNEW         
 EVERYONE, NOW YOU DON'T HARDLY KNOW   
 ANYBODY."
