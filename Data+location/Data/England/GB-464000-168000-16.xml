		<title>16RECREATION - BURGHFIELD</title>
		<content> Burghfield Sailing Club moved to      
 Theale Water in 1977.  It was formerly
 Burghfield Lake Sailing Club and used 
 gravel pits at Pingewood.  The land   
 is rented from A.R.C. and consists of 
 roughly three acres of grassland and  
 two hundred acres of water.  The      
 clubhouse comprises a clubroom,       
 changing rooms, kitchen and bar.  The 
 porta cabin on the site is used by the
 Berkshire Schools Sail Training Scheme
 and the additional boathouse is used  
 to store rescue boats and equipment.  
 There are two jetties - one floating  
 and the other made of scaffolding and 
 wood. The boat park is roughly two    
 acres in area, there is an acre of    
 grass for spectators and a half an    
 acre of car parking space.  There are 
 about 1000 members, 60% of whom sail  
 dinghies such as Lasers, Solos and    
 Enterprises: others use sailboards.   </content>
