		<content> This is a rural area with 463 on the  
 electoral register. Small Dole is a   
 small village in the north of the     
 area. The name Dole means a division  
 of communal land, and the word Dal is 
 still used in Sussex dailect to       
 describe a strip of land. The main    
 residential part of the  village is to
 the east of the through road. Here are
 private houses and a small council    
 estate. To the west is horticultural  
 and agricultural land. Small Dole     
 stands on a sandy ridge of land       
 eminantly suitable for growing flowers
 and vegetables. Some householders sell
 these from their homes. The sandy     
 ridge continues east as can be seen by
 local names, Tottington Sands,        
 Truleigh Sands, Edburton and Perching 
 Sands. There is a general store in    
 Small Dole with sub Post Office, small
 village hall and public house.        </content>
