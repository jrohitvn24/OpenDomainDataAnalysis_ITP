		<title>18How Camberley was Named</title>
		<content> In the early 19th Century, there was  
 tented accomodation for the armies of 
 the Dukes of York and Cambridge, on   
 Bagshot Heath.  As these became       
 permanent, the areas were named       
{Yorktown}and{Cambridge Town.}         
                                       
 In 1812 the Military Academy was moved
 from Woolwich to Sandhurst, Cambridge 
 Town, and in the 1870s, the{railway}  
 came to Cambridge Town, improving     
 communications and leading to a       
 large increase in the volume of mail. 
                                       
 The{Royal Mail}confused Cambridge Town
 with Cambridge and at their           
 insistence, the former changed its    
 name to Camberley. Yorktown is still  
 so called.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
