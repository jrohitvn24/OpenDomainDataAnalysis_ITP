		<title>14The aerial or pylon, Ousden</title>
		<content> It was proposed during 1984-5 that a  
 pylon or aerial should be erected on  
 the outskirts of Ousden on a site     
 known locally as the pightle. Although
 this was a piece of scrub land with   
 trees not used for housing or farmland
 and was in an isolated position       
 planning permission had to be obtained
 from the paris, district and county   
 councils. It was turned down by all 3 
 as it was felt that it would not be in
 keeping with the surrounding          
 countryside. The company involved, an 
 in-car telephone company then appealed
 to the Ministry of the Environment for
 permission which was granted. It will 
 now be possible for construction to go
 ahead despite the views of the        
 councillors. A great deal of          
 resentment was felt locally about this
 and other matters of local importance 
 when locals are ignored by government.</content>
