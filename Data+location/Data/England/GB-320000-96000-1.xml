		<content> the area is part of rural East Devon, 
 just over 20 miles east of Exeter and 
 7 miles north of of the south Devon   
 coastline at Seaton. Most of the area 
 is part of Widworthy parish with the  
 other parts in the parishes of Shute  
 and Colyton. The area is very         
 undulating with numerous wooded areas 
 and small farms connected by narrow   
 Devon lanes. The general impression is
 one of quiet rural calm, where one is 
 easily able to get away from urban    
 scrawl and be thrilled by the ever    
 changing vistas just around the next  
 bend in the road. The two streams     
 which cross the area are usually slow 
 and meandering, and the roads, on the 
 whole unclassified, narrow, winding   
 and not going anywhere in particular. 
 There is no major place of habitation,
 only Umborne could be classified as   
 even a hamlet.                        </content>
