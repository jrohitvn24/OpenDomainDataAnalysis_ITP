		<content> A rural area with scattered farms and 
 coattages, grazing, mainly for sheep  
 with a few cattle and pockets of      
 arable farming.  roughly one-third of 
 the area contains mature indigenous   
 woodlands.  Very little rise and fall 
 in vermain.  A large part has no      
 arhiculal access, except for tracks   
 and farm roads.  The two main roads   
 connect with villages outside the     
 area.  The village of Beare Green     
 straddles the main road, with a recent
 ly closed old village school, a       
 filling station, chapel, social club, 
 pub, public ;playing field and a      
 recent village hall.  Part of the     
 village lies ourside the area.  There 
 is very little new building and no    
 industry.
