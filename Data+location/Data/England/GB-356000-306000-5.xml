		<title>05Work in the Area</title>
		<content>  Most people in the area used to work 
 on farms but now not many are employed
 to work on the land. Farmers do take  
 on casual labour at busy times such as
 harvesting ploughing and sowing.      
  To find work people have had to      
 travel to the towns of{TELFORD,       
{SHREWSBURY}and{BRIDGNORTH.}Quite a    
 number of people work at Buildwas     
 Power Station.                        
  Now only a few workers are employed  
 on the farms because machinery is     
 taking their place. There is no other 
 work in the area.                     
  There is only a little unemployment.
