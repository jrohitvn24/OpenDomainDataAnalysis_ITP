		<content> There are no doctors in our area and  
 most local people go to Doctor        
 Marshall in Birstwith. Some  people go
 all the way to Harrogate, Ripon and   
 Pateley Bridge to go to the dentist.  
 We have a school dentist who treats   
 children at school and visits twice a 
 year to do this.                      
  There is a mobile library which goes 
 though Burnt Yates on a Thursday and  
 other villages on various other days  
 around the area every week. There is  
 only one shop which is in Birstwith   
 and situated next to the school. Most 
 people buy their food from Harrogate. 
 There is a garage in Burnt Yates at   
 the bottom of Bar Hill next to the New
 Inn. The garage sevices cars,and      
 petrol is avalable. The times of the  
 buses that go through Burnt Yates are 
 0954hrs 1329hrs 1829hrs. People who   
 don't travel by buses travel by cars. </content>
