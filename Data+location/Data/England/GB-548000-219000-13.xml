		<title>13A SWIMMING LESSON</title>
		<content> At 10.15am we set off for swimming.I  
 sat next to Helen. Claire and Katie   
 were behind us. They kept sticking    
 their heads through the gaps to talk  
 to us. Katie's got such a big head    
 that she got it stuck! We eventually  
 got to the pool. Mr Hardey said       
 "Driver's side first". I was door side
 so we had to wait a few seconds before
 getting out of the coach. We rushed   
 into the changing rooms to get        
 ghanged. The footbath was freezing so 
 I walked slowly through it but Emma   
 came up and splashed me. Our lesson   
 was taken by Mr Hardey and we         
 concentrated on breaststroke. Matthew 
 jumped in at the wrong moment and Mr  
 Hardey's spotless trainers got wet.   
 Mrs Robinson blew her whistle and we  
 all climbed out. Stephen nearly went  
 into the wrong changing room but Mrs  
 Robinson reminded him luckily.        </content>
