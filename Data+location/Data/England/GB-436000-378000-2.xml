		<title>02APPERKNOWLE VILLAGE</title>
		<content>      Apperknowle is a small village   
 that overlooks the valley of the      
 River Drone. The road up to           
 Apperknowle from the valley bottom    
 enters the village as a 1 in 7 hill.  
      The village grew last century    
 with the opening of the coal mines.   
 These were only small mines and       
 didn't remain productive for very     
 long. The coal was transported down   
 the hillside by private rail track to 
 the main railway along the valley     
 bottom. All of the miners' terraced   
 cottages have now been demolished and 
 new council houses take their place.  
 Many of the other dwellings are old   
 cottages and private bungalows. There 
 is a population of about 573. The     
 village has a green that has recently 
 been developed on the site of former  
 houses. New trees have been planted.
