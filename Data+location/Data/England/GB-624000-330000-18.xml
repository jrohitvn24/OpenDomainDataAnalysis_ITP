		<content> Every year people come to this area   
 for their holidays.There are many     
 places for them to visit such as      
 Felbrigg Hall, Blickling              
 Hall,{(National Trust).}The Norfolk   
{Broads}are not far from this area and 
 the coast is only about 5miles away.  
 Lots of people get seasonal emploment 
 because of the high standard of the   
 holiday trade.There is not many hotels
 in this area and most people come to  
 Norfolk to see the wildlife.          
 Many people come to this area from the
{Midlands}and like it so much that they
 either buy a{holiday}house here or buy
 a house to retire to .However ,in the 
 winter it is quiet not quiet so       
 beautiful when the north wind is      
 blowing{! }Also the lack of buses and 
 shops in the country areas upsets     
 some people.North Norfolk is very     
 peaceful compared to the city.        </content>
