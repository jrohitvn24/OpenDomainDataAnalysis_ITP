		<title>04BEAFORD YOUTH CLUB</title>
		<content>   The Beaford Youth Club was formed   
 in May 1985, and uses the Beaford     
 Village Hall as its base.  The Club   
 meets on a Thursday evening,          
 commencing at 6.30 p.m. Children of   
 ages 7 to 11 years attend the first   
 part of the evening, until 7.30 p.m., 
 when older children arrive.           
   The Club has several facilities:- a 
 mini pool table, a table-tennis table,
 a dart board, a skittle alley, a      
 record player, and borrows P.E. mats  
 from the school.  Soft drinks, crisps 
 and sweets can be purchased.          
   The membership is 20p for an evening
 session, which ends at 9.30 p.m.      
   The membership is not confined to   
 Beaford, but accepts children from    
 Roborough and St. Giles parishes also.
