		<title>13Canford Heath's growth.</title>
		<content> The things that have changed.         
 During the 12 years our families have 
 lived in Canford Heath lots of changes
 have been made.The main thing is that 
 people have done a lot of building on 
 the heathland.We now have only half of
 the heathland left.In 1973 the council
 purchased a further 533 acres of land 
 from Lord Wimborne to develop.They    
 have built a large shopping area      
 (INTERNATIONAL).Before this we had a  
 Waitrose in Adastra Square but when   
 International came it took all the    
 custom and Waitrose closed down.After 
 this Kwik Save replaced Waitrose.We   
 have community facilities schools,    
 shops and amenity areas.The heathland 
 behind Verity Crescent used to be a   
 good area for walks and children could
 catch newts in the big ponds but this 
 has been destroyed by a motorway.
