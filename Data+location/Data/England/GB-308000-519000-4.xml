		<content> The stables have been going for about 
 three and a half years. Disabled      
 riding has been going two and a half  
 years. The stables open for riding at 
 ten o'clock in the morning, but the   
 woman in charge gets up at half past  
 seven in the morning to feed the      
 horses. This is the food, horse and   
 pony nuts, bran, dried cornflakes,    
 stud cubes. There are twenty horses,  
 so two people come full time and four 
 more at the weekends to help. These   
 are the the sorts of horses that they 
 keep, Fell ponies, New Forest, part   
 Arab and Welsh. They only use fell    
 ponies for riding. Each pony has it's 
 own saddle and bridle. If a pony wears
 a different saddle or bridle it will  
 hurt them. There are twenty different 
 routes for the treks. Horses retire at
 the age of fifteen to twenty, some    
 work longer, it depends on the horse. </content>
