		<title>13A modern school day</title>
		<content> I woke up at 7 o'clock and stayed in  
 bed until 7.30, then I dressed &amp; had  
 a wash. I then had some Shreddies. At 
 8.30 I left for school &amp; arrived at   
 8.45. When the bell went we went in   
 for assembly. When assembly finished  
 we had our first lesson and then a    
 break. Then we went in again &amp; had    
 another lesson. At 12.15 I had lunch  
 and did laying up. After lunch we had 
 Geography and afterwards it was break 
 again. After break we had Science     
 which was boring. Then it was time to 
 go home. Mum picked me up in the      
 car-park and we drove home. When we   
 got home I went next door and watched 
 children's programmes. When tea was   
 ready I went home. After tea I went   
 and messed about in my room. Then I   
 went downstairs and watched "The Young
 Ones" before I went to bed.
