		<content> Of the families interviewed only one  
 did not have a television set and that
 was for religious reasons. Most       
 televisions were coloured sets and    
 many had a second set which was       
 portable and usually black and white. 
 About one in ten also owned a video   
 recorder and hired videos of popular  
 films to watch at home. About one in  
 eight of families with school children
 owned a computer that was capable of  
 playing games.                        
 The local Community Arts group in     
 Newent runs a programme of films      
 during the winter months. Popular     
 recent films are to be seen at the    
 cinema in Gloucester.                 
 The television is by far the greatest 
 source of home entertainment and      
 outside various groups run dances and 
 supper evenings especially during the 
 winter season.                        </content>
