		<content> A REGULAR BUS SERVICE TO BP. AUCKLAND 
 AND DARLINGTON MEANT PEOPLE WERE      
 EASILY ABLE TO TRAVEL ALLOWING THEM TO
 MOVE LONGER DISTANCES TO WORK.        
 CHILDREN IN THOSE DAYS PLAYED         
 DIFFERENT GAMES FROM NOW SUCH AS      
 ROUNDERS, WHIP AND TOP, MARBLES,      
 HOPSCOTCH, HOOPS, SKIPPING, TIP -CAN  
 AND MANY SINGING AND BALL GAMES. LIFE 
 NOWADAYS IS BETTER IN THAT WE HAVE A  
 BETTER STANDARD OF LIVING AND ARE     
 SPARED A LOT OF THE OLD DRUDGERY WITH 
 MODERN LABOUR SAVING DEVICES. ONE OF  
 THE DISADVANTAGES OF THE PRESENT DAY  
 IS THAT THE PACE OF LIFE IS QUICKER   
 AND MUCH NOISIER.
