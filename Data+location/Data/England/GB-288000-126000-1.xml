		<title>01Dulverton and its environs</title>
		<content>    Our D Block is mostly made up of   
 undulating countryside with deep      
 valleys and wooded hillsides,and      
 hundreds of fields of grass.          
 Dulverton nestles in one of these     
 quiet valleys with steep wooded slopes
 all around.It is a friendly little    
 town of about 1300 people and provides
 for the needs of local people and     
 tourists.                             
    Tourists flock to this area,as it  
 is set within the National Park of    
 Exmoor.They come for the beauty and   
 peacefullness of the area,and also for
 hunting,fishing,shooting and walking. 
 The River Barle passes through the    
 town.It is a small,fast flowing       
 river with rocks and deep pools where 
 trout are to be seen.
