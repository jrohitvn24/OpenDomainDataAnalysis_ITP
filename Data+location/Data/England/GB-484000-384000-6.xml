		<title>06Trent Valley Power Stations.</title>
		<content> The{Trent Valley}is a very flat area  
 to the west of Gainsborough.My        
 neighbour works at West Burton power  
 Station which is a thermal power      
 station built on the west bank of the 
 Trent.                                
 Although the power station is very    
 large;there are four generators and   
 eight cooling towers,he is one of six 
 men who work in the control room.From 
 this room they control all the working
 of the station.The power station uses 
{coal}from the{Nottinghamshire}        
 coalfield and water from the River    
 Trent.The coal that is burnt in the   
 boilers is crushed as fine as talcum  
 powder before it is ignited.          
 There is a social club and a sports   
 club at the station.Table tennis is a 
 very popular sport at the club and the
 power station has three teams in the  
 Gainsborough and District league.     </content>
