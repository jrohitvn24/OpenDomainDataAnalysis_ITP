		<content> When my mum was younger she used to   
 play whip and top, which is a top     
 which you whip to keep spinning.      
 Hopscotch is a game where you throw a 
 stone onto a square and you hop in    
 every square except the one with the  
 stone in.  When my dad was younger he 
 used to play hide and seek which is   
 where some people hide and one person 
 counts to a certain number then comes 
 to find you. Fox and hounds is where  
 one person hides and others chase or  
 find them. I play tiggy, where        
 somebody is on and has to chase after 
 people and tig them.  Computer games  
 are games on a T.V. played by pressing
 keys on a keyboard or by moving a     
 joystick.
