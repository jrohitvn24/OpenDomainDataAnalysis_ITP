		<content>   In Sandwich there are many different
sorts of recreational facility. e.g. a 
boxing ring, numerous pubs, acres of   
open grassland, sports fields, slimming
classes, cricket grounds, football     
pitches and the River Stour.           
   The needs of the Old Age Pensioners 
(2/5th of the population) are also     
taken in to account with a bowling     
green, and bingo hall. The town walls  
also give a chance to walk along a     
well tended path.                      
   The river itself incorporates       
activities such as pleasure cruising,  
canoeing, fishing and rambling along   
its banks.                             
   Sandwich Bay also provides          
recreational facilities due to its     
privacy, shelter and beaches.
