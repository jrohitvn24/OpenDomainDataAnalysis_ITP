		<title>18A Mum's Day</title>
		<content> Awoke at 7.30a.m.&amp; managed to get out 
 of bed by 8 o'clock. Would have       
 preferred it to be 9 o'clock at least.
 Should not have stayed up until after 
 midnight. Gave children their cereals 
 &amp; toast for breakfast which they      
 consume with relish even if they are  
 not fully awake for the first few     
 chews. Husband has toast and black    
 coffee for his breakfast prepared     
 totally oblivious to the presence of  
 others. My breakfast is porridge and a
 cup of tea, two cups if I have        
 time.Not today though,I have to go to 
 work. Run for the bus as usual but    
 need not have bothered since the bus I
 usually catch did not arrive.Next one 
 arrives ten minutes later so get to   
 work a little late. Work in a shoe    
 shop in Blackburn.My arrival home     
 usually coincides with the children's 
 return from school,but not today!     </content>
