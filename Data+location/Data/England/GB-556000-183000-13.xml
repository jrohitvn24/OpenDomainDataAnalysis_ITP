		<title>13THE M25: UPMINSTER</title>
		<content>   The{M25}is a{motorway}around London 
 linking towns and cities all over the 
 country.In our area it runs east of   
 Upminster across farmland.            
   It has six lanes:three one way and  
 three the other.On either side of the 
 road is a hard shoulder used for any  
 breakdowns.Along this at 100 metre    
 intervals are AA and RAC emergency    
 phones.                               
   Originally to be the A16 the M25 has
 been built by 'Costain' but in some   
 areas it is still under construction. 
 When finished (by 1990) it will circle
 London relieving inner city traffic.  
   Although a help to motorists ever   
 since they opened it, the             
 controversial road has caused many    
 complaints from nearby inhabitants    
 because of the noise from traffic.
