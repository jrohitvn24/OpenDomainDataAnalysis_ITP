		<content>{BANBURY LANE, NORTHAMPTON TO BANBURY} 
 is the oldest Northamptonshire route, 
 once part of the Jurassic Way.  For   
 centuries it was used as a Drove Road,
 sheep being driven from Wales to Nor- 
 thampton &amp; beyond until the advent of 
 the railways.  Much of the Lane was   
 metalled but parts remained earth, in-
 cluding from Adstone Lodge South to   
 Moreton Pinkney-Weston Road, along    
 which horse &amp; carts plied within      
 living memory.  Gradually the 30ft.   
 By-Way open to All became 6ins. wide  
 in places with hedges meeting in the  
 middle.  In 1981 the Green Friends of 
 Banbury Lane was formed.  By 1983 the 
 two miles were opened up part to the  
 Central Bends cleared radically by a  
 farmer the rest by Youth Action &amp; a   
 Community Enterprise Team.  Unfor-    
 tunately some roots were left &amp; the   
 Lane is getting impassable again.     </content>
