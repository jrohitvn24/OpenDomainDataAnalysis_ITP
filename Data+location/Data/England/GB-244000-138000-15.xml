		<content> In 1955 people didn't have the same   
 foods as we have now.It was only 10   
 years after the war and people didn't 
 have as much money as they do now so  
 they had cheaper things like Pig's    
 Trotters.Then they had ice-cream and  
 crisps but not flavoured ones but     
 nowadays people have flavoured        
 everything!They didn't have American  
 foods like French Fries,Burgars and   
 other things like that.In fact they   
 didn't have many foreign foods at     
 all.Turkey and Pheasant and Duck were 
 quality foods that people didn't have 
 very often and were luxury foods.In my
 class the favourite food for children 
 being roast dinner with 10 people     
 preferring that,2nd favourite meal is 
 fish'n'chips with 9 people and then   
 fishfingers and chips with 2          
 people.Nowadays people have more      
 ready-packed foods and frozen foods.  </content>
