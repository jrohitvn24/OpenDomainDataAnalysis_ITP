 The School at Oare is a Church of     
 England Controlled Junior and Infant  
 School. It serves the whole area for  
 children between 5-11 years. The      
 school has, at present, 75 children   
 and these are divided into three      
 classes; the Infants aged 5-7 years,  
 the lower Juniors aged 7-9 years and  
 the upper Juniors aged 9-11 years.    
 Children who live in the village      
 itself generally walk to school,but   
 those who come from farther afield are
 either brought in by a minibus or     
 taxi,provided by the County Council,  
 or are brought in Parents'cars.       
   At the age of 11 years we have to   
 leave this school and go to Secondary 
 Education, either at Pewsey or        
 St.John's, Marlborough Comprehensive. 
 Pewsey School takes children aged     
 11-16 years and if you wish to attend </content>
