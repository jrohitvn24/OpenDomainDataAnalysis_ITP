		<title>05Gorran - Population</title>
		<content> Apart from the village of Gorran Haven
 the area is sparsely populated,with   
 only the old farmhouses at Carvinnick,
 Treveague,Penare and the imposing     
 Lamledra House (built in 1910 as a    
 holiday home and later used as a      
 school).Gorran Haven itself is a      
 mixture of old and new.The original   
 houses are grouped around Church St.  
 and Rattle St. leading down to the    
 harbour - some date back to 1550.Sadly
 most of these old cottages are empty  
 for most of the year,being used now as
 holiday homes.A row of coastguard     
 cottages built in 1867 overlook the   
 harbour - there is one coastguard     
 resident now.Most of the houses in    
 Gorran Haven have been built during   
 the past 25 years - modern bungalows  
 stretching up the hill,competing for a
 view of the sea.Fortunately the heart 
 of the village remains unchanged.     </content>
