{Beatrice  }My Pets                    
 The youngest of our dogs is a         
 chocolate labrador,the other dog is a 
 terrier called Barley.                
 Barley runs away because she can get  
 under the gate.                       
 When my mother goes outside with the  
 dogs she says,"Now where has that dog 
 gone?"                                
 Then we have to go and look for the   
 dog,and when we get back the dog is   
 curled up in her basket.
