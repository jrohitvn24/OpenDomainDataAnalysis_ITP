Children like playing games.With their 
teacher they might play Rounders,Rugby 
touch,Football,Football rounders,Shinty
or Non-stop Cricket.But in the         
playground they like Hop-scotch,sticky 
glue,it,skipping and ball games.       
   If you don't know how to play sticky
glue this is how you play it.You have  
five people and one of them is sticky  
glue.She puts out her hand and each    
person holds a finger.Then the person  
who is sticky glue says a riddle and   
when she says sticky glue every body   
runs to find a drain but if you are    
touched you stand still and wait for   
someone to free you.                   
  At home lots of children like to play
board games like Monopoly or Cluedo and
some lucky children have computers and 
they play eletronic games on them.
