 Most days begin around 7.15a.m.with   
 breakfast,getting the children        
 up,making beds,taking children to     
 school,and doing any shopping like    
 collecting the daily paper.Today is a 
 quick tidy around the house,cup of    
 coffee,a look at the paper and start a
 day's baking.I usually make a double  
 quantity of everything and put it in  
 the freezer.By the time I have baked, 
 washed up and decorated anything which
 needs doing it is time for the        
 children to come home from school.So  
 then you fall back into a daily       
 routine:arranging tea,washing         
 up,seeing to pack-ups for the         
 following day and trying to get them  
 to bed.The phone has to be            
 answered.There are errands to be run  
 for husbands or children.A woman's    
 work is never done.                   </content>
