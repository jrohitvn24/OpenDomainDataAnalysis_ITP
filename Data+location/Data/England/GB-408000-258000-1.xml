		<title>01General View, North Alcester</title>
		<content>      This area is rural, a rolling    
 landscape made up of small, hedged    
 fields and patches of woodland. Two   
 rivers, the Arrow and Alne, flow from 
 North and East and meet in Alcester on
 their way to the Avon.                
      There are several isolated farms,
 3 villages - Great Alne, Coughton and 
 King's Coughton - and a fast-growing  
 residential area north of Alcester.   
      Employment opportunities in this 
 area are to be found on the Arden     
 Forest Industrial Estate.             
      The area's beautiful, rural      
 setting offers recreational facilities
 such as walking, riding and fishing.  
      For tourists there are the N.T.  
 properties: Kinwarton Dovecote and    
 Coughton Court with its ford. Churches
 at Coughton(2), Great Alne &amp; Kinwarton
 are of interest to casual visitors.
