		<content>The Chiltern Cheshire Home in Gerrards 
Cross is one of the 220 Cheshire Homes 
throughout the world.In this home there
are 19 people:12 women and 7 men,who   
are loved and cared for.Out of the 19  
there is 1 accident victim,4 were born 
disabled and the remaining 14 were     
disabled by various illnesses.In the   
Home there are 40 Social Workers and 2 
trained Nurses;this means there are    
roughly 2 Social Workers per resident. 
There are only 2 trained Nurses,as the 
residents do not need much medical     
care,only affection and love.  A visit 
to Lourdes is arranged every year.The  
Duchess of Kent opened this Home in    
1968.                                  
 The patients are taken out as often as
possible.There is no shortage of       
volunteers to take them and help.They  
regularly go to church.
