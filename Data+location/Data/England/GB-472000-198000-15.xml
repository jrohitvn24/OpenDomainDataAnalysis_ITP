		<content>Brenda Rhodes has lived in Chinnor for 
16 years.The village is a fast growing,
dormitory and Mrs Rhodes feels that it 
has lost much of it's community spirit.
She shops in Chinnor and High Wycombe, 
particularly from the hyper-market,    
ASDA. Her favourite shop is Ells and   
Farrier,which she says is very old     
fashioned and sells a fascinating range
of theatrical beads and sequins.       
In her spare time Mrs Rhodes does      
quilling, makes small toys,reads,cooks 
and is a member of the Women's         
Institute. Her hobbies are collecting  
greetings cards(1850-1950), collecting 
china made and painted by E. Radford,  
collecting eggcups,embroidery and      
knitting. She feels that Chinnor would 
be improved by a community centre      
including a swimming pool.A by-pass is 
also needed to stop heavy lorries using
the village to get to the M40.         </content>
