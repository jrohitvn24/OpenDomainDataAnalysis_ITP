		<title>09VILLAGE HALL WELBURY&amp;DEIGHTO</title>
		<content> The hall in Welbury was erected in    
 1945 and is basically a structure made
 of tin sheeting.This year after great 
 deliberation it was decided to        
 purchase the land upon which the hall 
 stands, and to this end an energetic  
 round of fund raising activities has  
 taken place ranging from a sponsered  
 fun run to an ambitious barbeque on a 
 cold and windy September evening.     
 Deighton has a small hall built in    
 1952 and made of wood.Both halls are  
 used once each month by the Women's   
 Institute group, and also for Domino  
 and Whist drives.The games are played 
 on a progressive basis, supper is     
 served midway in the proceedings,     
 prizes are won, and local news        
 exchanged. Teas, sales, elections, &amp;  
 meetings make up the rest of the use  
 of the halls.
