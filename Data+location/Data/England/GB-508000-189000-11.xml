		<content> The house called Fairacre stands on   
 the site of an ancient house called   
 Sigers which was owned by John Ferne  
 of Wylchers in the year 1565.The house
 Fairacre extended from Wiltshire Lane 
 to Fore Street,which was called Frog  
 Lane.In 1853 the house and land were  
 leased to George Baylis,with authority
 for him to have a brickfield in the   
 area now covered by Salisbury Road.The
 present house dates back in time from 
 around 1916 and was probably built by 
 a Captain Bennett Edwards of Haydon   
 Hall.A Mr Collins lived in Fairacre   
 and his initials can be seen on a     
 nearby boundary post.Fairacre was     
 restored by Hillingdon Borough Council
 in 1978 and the house now forms part  
 of a Borough housing scheme for the   
 elderly people in the nearby area.
