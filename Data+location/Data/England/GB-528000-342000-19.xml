		<content>                                       
 You can play the game anywhere.The    
 object of the game is to get          
 as close to the centre as possible.To 
 play{Peep Behind The Curtain}you need 
 quite a lot of people.One person is   
 chosen to stand with their back       
 towards the rest of the children. The 
 group of children start walking       
 forward and then the other person     
 turns round and if he sees anybody    
 walking they are out.{Donkey}is the   
 easiest game to play.All you need     
 is a ball, a wall and two or more     
 players.You get in single line,then   
 you throw ball against the wall and   
 when it bounces back you jump over it 
 then the next person has a go and so  
 on.{Whats the time Mr.Wolf}is similar 
 to Peep behind the curtain. One person
 is chosen and the rest wait behind    
 then they say,"Whats the time Mr Wolf.</content>
