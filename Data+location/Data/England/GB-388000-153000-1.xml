		<title>01General Review of the Area</title>
		<content>      The area covered in the 3x4 block
 is mostly farmland, crossed by several
 metalled minor roads connecting West  
 Ashton, Steeple Ashton, Heywood,      
 Bratton and Edington, and some        
 unmetalled farm tracks, bridleways and
 footpaths. The south east corner of   
 the block is crossed by the Westbury -
 Newbury railway line.                 
      Housing is confined to the S.W.  
 end of West Ashton village,the two    
 small farming hamlets of East Town and
 Dunge, Capps Lane, and isolated farms.
 Dunge Farm is noted by The Dept of    
 the Environment for being a medieval  
 moated site.                          
      In the area of the  block due    
 south of Steeple Ashton village a few 
 derelict airforce buildings and       
 concrete roadways can be seen,        
 remnants of the days when Keevil      
 airfield was used by the R.A.F.       </content>
