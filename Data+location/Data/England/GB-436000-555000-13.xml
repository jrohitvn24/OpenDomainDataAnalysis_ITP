		<title>13A DAY IN THE LIFE OF RACHEL</title>
		<content> A typical day for me would be to get  
 up at 7.30.Wash,dress and have my     
 breakfast of toast and fruit juice.At 
 8.20 I go to school with my friend    
 from next door.School opens at 8.55   
 but I go in early to help in the hall 
 for Assembly.The rest of the morning  
 is Maths,English and any corrections  
 from previous work.At 12 o'clock I go 
 home for lunch, returning early to    
 play Tiddly_Igo with my friends.There 
 are two teams,one runs away,the other 
 has to catch them.When caught you     
 change round.School starts at 1.25    
 it is Art and then the teacher reads  
 more of our story  before 3.45.       
 Playtimes are Resource monitor duties.
 After school I usually play with my   
 friends at home.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
