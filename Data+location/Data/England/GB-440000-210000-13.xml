		<title>13HEDGEROW, CHURCH HANBOROUGH</title>
		<content>                                       
We studied a hedgerow at GR 427125 near
College Farm. It runs North-South along
a path which might have been the old   
route from Church Hanborough to        
Eynsham. On the west is a field with   
cows, and on the east a field of corn. 
The hedgerow has a line of huge elm    
stumps, the trees being cut down six   
years ago because of disease, and there
were traces of old wooden fencing and  
of old barbed wire.                    
                                       
We found common-nettle, red and white  
head nettle, knotgrass, cow parsley,   
common spotted orchid, dovesfoot       
cranesbill, ground ivy, common ivy and 
ribwort plantain. The dead tree stumps 
had holes and in one we found a small  
rabbit. We also found a spider,        
ladybirds, and a bird.
