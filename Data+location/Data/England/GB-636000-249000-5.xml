		<title>05More Ecology-the Butley Area</title>
		<content>This area has one of the lowest        
rainfall averages in the country.It is 
not recognised for extremes in         
temperature because of its proximity to
the sea. The air is always fresh and   
bracing, and is almost free from       
pollution of any kind, being far away  
from cities or major industries. The   
noise from the nearby Air Bases is on  
occasions annoying.                    
There are many footpaths and bridleways
which afford superb views of the varied
river landscape - the marshes and the  
broad tidal river with its wealth of   
birds especially the Avocet which      
breeds on Havergate island nearby, and 
the samphire which grows in abundance  
on the saltings. Rushes used for       
thatching grow at the river's edge. The
many dykes which have drained the      
marshes abound in eel.
