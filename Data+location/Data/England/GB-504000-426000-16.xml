		<title>16AMATEUR SPORT IN WEST HULL</title>
		<content> COSTELLO is the main local sports     
 centre. It is well used and had a new 
 stadium opened recently. Though it is 
 well used its main source of money is 
 council grants. It offers a wide range
 of sports (i.e. soccer, rugby,        
 cricket, squash, tennis, badminton,   
 weight training and athletics). Other 
 sports facilities are Pickering park, 
 most schools and East park.           
 FOOTBALL in our area its mostly       
 played for fun. The majority of people
 know the rules, but people change them
 according to where they are playing.  
 RUGBY has 2 separate games, rugby     
 union which is only played in senior  
 schools in our area. Junior High      
 Schools play rugby league.            
 NETBALL is a game played in nearly    
 every school, it is mostly played by  
 girls.
