		<content> Herm is visited by over 100,000       
 tourists each year. They are looking  
 for the "dream island" of which the   
 present tenant of Herm said; "If I was
 asked to design an island and place it
 anywhere in the world I chose, this is
 the island I would design, and this is
 where I would put it."                
 Herm has some of the best beaches     
 in the Channel Islands, the most      
 famous being Shell beach in the       
 north-east, where over 200 different  
 varities of shells have been found. It
 also has pretty scenery, fine         
 cliff walks and a large grassy        
 common where many rabbits live. Other 
 attractions are fishing and walking,  
 and for naturalists, birds, flowers   
 and insects abound. Herm's 500 acres  
 extend to 1,500 at low tide.
