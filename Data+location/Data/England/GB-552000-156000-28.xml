<title>28N. Sevenoaks, Seal &amp; Kemsing</title>
<content>

This is a residential area on the north edge of Sevenoaks merging into farmland and woodland. &lt;br />&lt;br />The 19th.C. Bat and Ball station is so called because the former industry,    manufacturing cricket bats and balls attracted commuters to the area.&lt;br />&lt;br /> Seal is an old picturesque village on the old Saxon road (now A25) from Winchester to Maidstone.        &lt;br />&lt;br />Kemsing is a typical Downland Pilgrim's Way village with a church and a Well of interest. There is no longer a Youth Hostel as it has been converted to houses.        &lt;br />&lt;br />There are many former gravel pits now filled with water and used in a variety of ways - Nature Reserve, Water sports and park. &lt;br />&lt;br />There is a small modern industrial estate, supporting light industry on the site of the old brick works at the Chaucer Estate.   &lt;br /> &lt;br />
