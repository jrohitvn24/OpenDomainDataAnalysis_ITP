		<title>11EMPLOYMENT AROUND WINCHESTER</title>
		<content> Many people live on the outskirts of  
 Winchester and travel into the city   
 centre to their{jobs.}There are many  
 large buildings around Winchester     
 where people can{work,}for example in 
 the hospital doctors, nurses, cooks,  
 cleaners,receptionists etc.are needed.
 Another large building is the prison. 
 This needs many prison officers to    
 guard the prisoners. There are many   
 schools where qualified teachers can  
 work. Also schools need cleaners,     
 caretakers and secretaries to work on 
 the premises.Some of the people in    
 Winchester are employed by the City   
 and County councils, most of them     
 working as architects, computer       
 operators, engineers, secretaries etc.
{Employment}in the area is good because
 of the variety and number of large    
 employers who need many people to work
 for them.                             </content>
