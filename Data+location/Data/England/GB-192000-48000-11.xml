		<title>11Grampound Bowling Club</title>
		<content>  The bowling club in Grampound is     
 quite a small one.It is next to the   
 recreation field and has its own club 
 house.The men of the club take care of
 the green.It has to be kept very short
 and watered a lot.The children in the 
 village are very careful with the     
 bowling green.If a ball goes onto the 
 green you must never run to get it but
 walk very carefully and slowly across 
 the grass so that you do not damage   
 it.You can start bowling when you are 
 13.The bowling club is open every day 
 from 10.00 till the sun goes down.    
  Grampound Club plays matches against 
 other Clubs from Probus, St Stephen,  
 Bugle, St Austell, Looe, Fowey,       
 Veryan.If the club beats all these    
 clubs it goes on to play other        
 counties.The ladies wear white        
 skirts shirts and hats.The men wear   
 white trousers and shirts.            </content>
