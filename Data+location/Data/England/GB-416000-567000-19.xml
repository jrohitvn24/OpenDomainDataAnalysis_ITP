		<content>   In Westerhope there are three       
 churches, St Johns, St Marks and      
 Westerhope Methodist. Between         
 these churches every week they have   
 at least fifteen services.            
   All kinds of people work in the     
 churches doing small but important    
 jobs like cleaning the churches and   
 flower arranging. People work as      
 churchwardens, servers and            
 crucifer, who look after the church.  
   At St Marks church they do not have 
 a Sunday school like they have at St  
 Johns and at Westerhope Methodist but 
 they do have a Catholic school.       
   Between these churches they have    
 at least one hundred and thirty six   
 weddings and one hundred and sixty    
 christenings in a year.               
   About nine hundred and fifty people 
 go to these churches.
