My mum works in Briggs which is a shoe 
shop in Stowmarket.   She sells shoes  
and measures peoples feet.   She wears 
a blue and white striped skirt and a   
white blouse in summer.   In winter she
wears a grey skirt and a white blouse. 
                                       
                                       
My dad works in Rumbelows which is an  
electric shop in Mildenhall.   He sells
fridges, televisions and ovens.        
Sometimes he has to unload the delivery
van and sometimes he has to go to      
someones house to mend something.   He 
wears trousers a shirt and a jumper    
with Rumbelows on it.
