		<title>13RECREATION SPORTS CLUBS</title>
		<content>{Ferndown}children have a wide range   
 of sporting activities to choose from.
{Ferndown Sports Centre}provides a     
 swimming pool, squash, badminton and  
 tennis courts, table tennis, weight   
 training, gym, football, judo and     
 rifle clubs.  At King George V playing
 fields there are football and cricket 
 pitches, also a bowling green.        
{Ferndown Judo Kwai}meet on a Saturday 
 evening. I am a member of the club and
 enjoy travelling to other parts of the
 country with them.  Judo is a very old
 self-defence sport from Japan.        
 At{Trickett's Cross}we hope that soon 
 the Council will build a{BMX}track.   
 BMX is one of the fastest-growing     
 sports in Britain today. Strong, light
 bikes are used on dirt tracks with    
 jumps and steep turns. Bikes can cost 
 up to Â£1200. I hope to make a career  
 out of BMX riding.                    </content>
