		<content> ATTITUDES TO CHANGE,FLECKNEY          
 These are some of the brief attitudes 
 to change some elderly residents of   
 Fleckney hold.                        
 A.Impressions of the past.            
 1)There were less houses              
 2)There were more small shops (no     
 supermarkets)                         
 3)Everyone knew each other, it was a  
 friendly place                        
 B.Changes for the better.             
 There have been improvement to        
 shopping,children's, medical,         
 transport, library and lighting       
 facilities as well as housing.        
 C.Changes for the worse.              
 The village has grown too large, the  
 roads are insufficent, the village is 
 dirtier with too much vandalism.      
 D.Is life better now?                 
 The general view was that inspite of  
 the improvements life was not better. </content>
