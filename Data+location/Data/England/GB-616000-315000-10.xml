		<content> ANNUAL EVENTS STILL REFLECT THE RURAL 
 NATURE OF THE AREA. THE CHURCH FETE,  
 AND A SIMILAR EVENT TO RAISE FUNDS FOR
 THE UPKEEP OF THE RECREATION GROUND,  
 ATTRACT ABOUT 500 PEOPLE EACH. FORMER 
 RESIDENTS OFTEN RETURN TO MEET FRIENDS
 AND CONTRIBUTE FINANCIALLY WHEN THE   
 VICAR OPENS HIS GARDENS FOR A CHURCH  
 "DO". NEWER RESIDENTS TEND TO INVOLVE 
 THEMSELVES WITH THE "REC" EVENT.      
 THE MAIN INDOOR SOCIAL EVENTS ARE     
 DANCES. OFTEN RUN BY THE PARENTS OF   
 SCHOOL CHILDREN. THE FIRST SCHOOL HAD 
 A TULIP DANCE WITH A TRIP TO HOLLAND  
 AS A PRIZE, THE LOCAL DRAMA GROUP HAVE
 ALSO ENTERTAINED. MANY MONTHLY AND    
 WEEKLY EVENTS TAKE PLACE. IN THESE    
 SEXES AND AGES TEND TO BE SEGREGATED, 
 BROWNIES AND CUBS ARE A TYPICAL       
 EXAMPLE, AND SO IS THE LOCAL BRANCH OF
 THE WOMENS INSTITUTE.
