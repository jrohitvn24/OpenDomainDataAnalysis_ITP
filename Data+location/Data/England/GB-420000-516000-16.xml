		<title>16THE RABY ESTATE.</title>
		<content> The land in the north west of the     
 block belongs to Lord Barnard and the 
 Raby estate.                          
 All the buildings are{whitewashed.    
 There are many local{legends          
 explaining this. The most common of   
 these is that{Lord Barnard}was lost in
 the mist and sought refuge in a farm  
 house. Believing it to be one of his  
 own he demanded his keep, only to     
 discover that it was privately owned. 
 To prevent such a mistake occurring   
 again he ordered that all his         
 buildings should be painted white.
