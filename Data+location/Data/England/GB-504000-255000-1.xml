		<content> This thriving agricultural region of  
 North Bedfordshire has a scattering of
 unspoilt villages. Patches of         
 deciduous woodland and neat           
 tessellating fields occupy the quiet  
 countryside which rises above the     
 valley of the River Ouse. The fields  
 are mostly arable, threaded together  
 by footpaths. Strolling along these   
 paths kaleidoscopic views are to be   
 had as the colours change from greens 
 to gold to brown, heralding the       
 sequence of the seasons. The ripening 
 rape and wheat are harvested, the     
 ground ploughed and sowed and the     
 growth cycle recommences.             
 Many of the cottages have thatched    
 roofs and the stone churches round    
 which they cluster have mini-spires   
 jutting above the parapets of the     
 towers.
