		<content>   A class of children has written of  
 the jobs being done by their parents  
 or other people in the locality.      
  Most of the male workers are employed
 full-time. Many of the females work   
 part-time or have jobs which they can 
 do at home;several of them having     
 sewing machines on which they make up 
 ready-cut-out  garments.              
   Large firms such as Fords, Van den  
 Berg and Jergens, Shell and Esso were 
 mentioned.                            
   People also work in the town centre 
 shops or in local firms such as       
 Celcon, New World Kitchens, the Sugar 
 Factory and locally based Container   
 Companies. The jobs they do include   
 welding,case making,typing and        
 storekeeping, nursing, restocking     
 shelves and serving drinks.
