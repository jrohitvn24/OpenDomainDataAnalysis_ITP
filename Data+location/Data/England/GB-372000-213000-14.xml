		<title>14The Severn Bore</title>
		<content> The reasons for the Severn's bore are 
 1)the funnel-shaped tidal approach up 
 the Bristol Channel where the mass of 
 water is squeezed between the         
 narrowing banks and 2)the             
 South-West orientation of the channel 
 which directs to the mouth of the     
 Severn the long waves which have been 
 rolled diagonally across the Atlantic 
 Ocean by the prevailing winds.There is
 a multiplicity of bores but the two or
 three which are most likely to be     
 notable each March and September are  
 forecast and groups of sightseers     
 gather at key-points(such as by our   
 main road between the public house,now
 named after the bore,and the post     
 office)to witness the progress of what
 they hope will be a good,spectacular  
 bore. On the crest of this wave,or    
 maybe behind or even under it,canoe or
 surf a few daring souls.              </content>
