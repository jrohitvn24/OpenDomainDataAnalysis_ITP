		<content>        The average farmer in our area 
 will plant perhaps four crops: Winter 
 Wheat, Winter Barley, Oil Seed Rape   
 and Beans.                            
        Between 40% and 60% of his land
 might be covered by Winter Wheat which
 is planted in October and harvested in
 July/August.                          
        Another 20% of his land might  
 be used for Winter Barley which is    
 planted and harvested at more or less 
 the same time as Winter Wheat.        
        Perhaps another 20% would be   
 used for either Oil Seed Rape or      
 Beans, or possibly both.              
        Our area has a mineral         
 deficiency of phosphate, so the rest  
 of the land would be left fallow with 
 some phosphate on it to recover for a 
 year.                                 
                                       
                                       </content>
