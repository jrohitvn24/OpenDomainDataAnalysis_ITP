		<content>  In our town we have several potters, 
 painters, sculpters and illustrators. 
 Some of our inhabitants have written  
 books, especially on local history,   
 local ecology or other topics about   
 our area. Most interestingly we have  
 three very intriguing toy makers who  
 work quite seperately on wooden dolls 
 houses, wooden moving toys and large  
 playground toys (like adventure       
 playground equipment).                
  Many housewives try home improvement 
 linked crafts like upholstery classes,
 needlecrafts and flower arranging.    
  We have an art gallery and a Bradford
 Arts/Crafts : Co-ordinating Committee.
 We also have a lady who practises the 
 art of mime and circus clowning       
 including stilt walking.
