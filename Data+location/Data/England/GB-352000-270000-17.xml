		<title>17Ludlow Hunt,Ashford C.</title>
		<content> The Ludlow Hunt stables and kennels   
 are situated between Ashford Carbonell
 and Caynham.The buildings were purpose
 -built in 1891 and hunt about a 10    
 mile radius of Ludlow,during the      
 months between September and February 
 on three days a week.The kennels are  
 run by the kennel huntsman or         
 "whipper-in" with a young boy to help 
 and a stud groom.There are 57 couples 
 of fox- hounds kept at the kennels,but
 they actually hunt with a pack of     
 about 17 couples.The hounds are a     
 mixture of English fox-hounds and     
 Welsh fox-hounds.There are 8 horses   
 kept at the stables which are for use 
 by the Master and the "whipper-in".The
 Hunt is financed by a levy paid by the
 local farmers and various fund raising
 events.The Master also contributes    
 financially to the running of the     
 Hunt.                                 </content>
