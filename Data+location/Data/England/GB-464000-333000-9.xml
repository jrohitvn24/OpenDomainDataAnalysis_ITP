		<content> We went to the precinct in Cotgrave   
 to interview people.70% of the people 
 did not work in Cotgrave and 50% of   
 those people used the bus,to go to    
 work.15% walked to work 10% used a    
 bike and 10% had a car.The remainder  
 went to work a different way each     
 day.                                  
 We asked them what amenities          
 they used in Cotgrave.The health      
 centre,shops and post office were the 
 most popular with the library and the 
 bank close behind.                    
 Most people thought there were not    
 enough amenities in Cotgrave and would
 like to have a swimming pool,a        
 comprehensive school and a cinema:    
 The nearest swimming pool is          
 Radcliffe-on-Trent about five miles   
 away and so all the children have to  
 be bussed to school.
