		<title>07WITHIEL FLOREY CHURCH</title>
		<content> St. Mary Magdalene, Withiel Florey.   
 The great days of this tiny parish    
 were during the excavation of iron ore
 on the Brendon Hills in the nineteenth
 century. Evidence of these workings   
 can still be seen in the north of the 
 parish reminding one of the links with
 Wales and the threat to turn these    
 hills into another Rhondda.           
 In was during these years around 1871 
 that the church became what you see   
 today. The tower is partly 13th       
 century and in the fifteenth century  
 there were other alterations. On the  
 feast of Epiphany 1871 an almost new  
 church was dedicated, the chancel had 
 been rebuilt and the nave improved.   
 The mistrels gallery was also removed 
 and the stained glass renewed. Tiles  
 also replaced the old pavement.       
 However the Noerman font still        
 remains.                              </content>
