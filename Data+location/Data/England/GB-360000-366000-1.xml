		<content> The major part of the area is sparsely
 populated with isolated farm houses   
 and cottages. The area known as Over  
 is mainly residential.There is one    
 large council owned estate and many   
 private dwellings. Small shops border 
 the access route.The activities of the
 area are predominantly those          
 associated with farming.This is mainly
 the rearing of dairy cattle (80%) on  
 the clay soils to the north and arable
 farming (mainly vegetable root crops) 
 on the sandy soils to the south.      
   Sand also provides the only industry
 in the area, the Tarmac Roadstone Sand
 Quarries at New Common.This expanding 
 industry provides construction        
 materials for much of the county.     
   Recreational amenities in the area  
 can be found at Marton Sands          
 (watersports) the Knights Grange      
 Complex and the Whitegate Way.        </content>
