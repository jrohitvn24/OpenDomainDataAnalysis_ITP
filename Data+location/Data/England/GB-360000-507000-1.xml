		<content>   Our 4km x  3km block is centred on  
 the village of Orton which, as well as
 the village of Orton, includes the    
 hamlets of Bretherdale and Greenholme 
 (SW), Raisbeck (E), Kelleth (SE) and  
 Longdale (S), as well as numerous     
 individual farms and cottages.        
   The Parish is situated in the south 
 east of the County of Cumbria and     
 until local government reorganisation,
 in 1974, was in Westmorland. For Local
 Government purposes it is in the area 
 of Eden District Council.             
   The village is 750 feet above sea   
 level with the ground to the north of 
 the area rising to 1,282 feet.        
   It is a rural area with stock       
 farming _ sheep and cattle _ providing
 the main occupation for the local     
 population.
