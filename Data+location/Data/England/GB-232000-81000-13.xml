		<content> The morning was misty and damp.  I    
 nearly forgot my netball stuff for the
 match we were playing against         
 Lifton.In school we went into Mr      
 Greenacre's assembly.  It was about   
 Jesus and his disciples. After that we
 did Oxford English one of my favourite
 subjects. At dinnertime I was on      
 dinner rota that means cutting up the 
 dinner for the younger children.      
 After dinner, on the field we had     
 fun but it is more fun when we play on
 the bars. After playtime we watched a 
 quick television programme before the 
 match.. It was about nature.When we   
 had changed for the match we made our 
 way to the cars and went to Lifton.At 
 the end of our game the score was 10 -
 ! We had won and I had scored 8 of the
 goals. Our second team won scoring 14 
 - 0. They were thrilled.
