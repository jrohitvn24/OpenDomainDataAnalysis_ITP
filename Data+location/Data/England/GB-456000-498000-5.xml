		<title>05RECREATION.BILSDALE BAND.</title>
		<content> Bilsdale Silver band is round about   
 100 years old.Mr Brotton of South Veiw
 Chop Gate has been a member for 25    
 years,since then there's been a lot of
 changes.When he started the band there
 were no girls but throughout the years
 the number of girls increased. Mr     
 Brottons grandfather was a band master
 for 25 years,his name was William     
 Garbutt he lived in Fangdale Beck and 
 had a band practice every Sunday. His 
 instrument was solo cornet. The lowest
 the band has ever got is 6 or 7 and   
 the highest it has ever got is 26.At  
 the moment the number of children in  
 the band is quite a lot infact there's
 just about more children than adults. 
 Mr William Wood of Spout House taught 
 Mr Brotton to play the big E Flat     
 base.At the moment is really good and 
 I think he will be good for a long    
 time to come.                         </content>
