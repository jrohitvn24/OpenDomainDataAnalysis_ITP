		<title>01WOKINGHAM - A MARKET TOWN</title>
		<content>  Wokingham is a small market town 25  
 miles west of London.Many of the      
 buildings in the town centre reflect  
 its historic past.Today Wokingham is a
 prosperous settlement in the computer 
 and commuter belt of Berkshire.The    
 growth of Wokingham has resulted in   
 new housing and major roads being     
 built on arable land around the town. 
 The town centre provides goods and    
 services.There are 3 supermarkets and 
 many smaller shops.All major banks and
 building societies are in the town.   
 Many activities are found in the town,
 these include Scouts, Guides, Youth   
 Clubs, a small Theatre and Churches.  
 Some workers commute to London, but   
 low unemployment is due to the growth 
 of the local electronics industry.The 
 growth of this industry should ensure 
 a continuing affluent lifestyle in a  
 pleasant environment for most people. </content>
