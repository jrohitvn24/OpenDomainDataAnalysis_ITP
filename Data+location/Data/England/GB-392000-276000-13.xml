		<content>   Most inhabitants live in            
{owner_occupied houses.}Many of these  
 are{cottages}that are very old that   
 have been{renovated}to a very high    
 standard of comfort.                  
  {Property prices}in the area are at a
{premium}as it is a desirable area in  
 which to live. It is close enough to  
 major towns and cities such as        
{Birmingham, Wolverhampton}and         
{Worcester}to make{commuting}to work   
 easy.                                 
   There are some{council houses}in the
 area, but no{estates.}The council     
 houses are most attractive.           
   Many of the{front gardens}are filled
 with plants and flowers that are      
 associated with the{cottage gardens}of
 many years ago.
