		<content> The church does not have a minister   
 since the death of the last           
 incumbent.Services are only held on   
 alternate Sundays.                    
 Housing has changed considerably with 
 15 new houses being built in the last 
 decade.                               
 The school bell used to be rung to    
 call in the children for school, this 
 is no longer done.                    
 In farming many hedges have been      
 destroyed to make modern methods      
 easier.  Two agricultural barns have  
 been constructed recently.  Farmers   
 used to deliver milk on carts, now    
 they use tractors.  Many trees have   
 had preservation orders put on them so
 that farmers cannot fell them without 
 permission.
