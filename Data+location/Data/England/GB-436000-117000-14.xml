		<content>                                       
 The hill fort is on Toot Hill . It was
 said that Queen Boadicia was buried   
 there . The area is now rented by Mrs 
 Rogers from Lord Romsey . There is a  
 bomb crater up there from the second  
 World War where Mrs Rogers house is   
 now . There used to be huts where the 
 army used to stay in the first world  
 war. There are five bomb shelters     
 scattered around the hill fort. The   
 ancient Encampment on Toot Hill was   
 the site of one of the warning beacons
 at the time of the Spanish Armada.    
 There is a tunnel leading from Mrs    
 Rogers house to a bomb shelter . The  
 hill fort is 84 metres high and about 
 100 metres across. The hill fort now  
 only looks like an ordinary hill.
