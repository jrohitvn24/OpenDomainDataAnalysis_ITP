		<content>Public house games, popular locally are
Basket Skittles, said to be against    
the local   bye-laws in Oxon where     
skittles were   banned by Puritans;    
darts, dominoes,   and cribbage, a     
card game.  There are   also fruit     
machines (gambling), and   electronic  
games called 'Space   Invaders'        
fighting games on TV screens.   Basket 
skittles is played on a table padded,  
to prevent noise, and surrounded by a  
screen of netting. 9 skittles have to  
be knocked over with a 'cheese' thrown 
by the players.  3       throws make   
one turn.  The competition is to       
knock over the most skittles.
