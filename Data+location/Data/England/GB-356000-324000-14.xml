		<title>14POPULATION</title>
		<content> POPULATION                            
 The population has been and still is  
 fairly static.  The Register of       
 Electors dated 15th February 1984     
 which covers this part of Stanton     
 totalled 147 people approximately.    
 The population is fairly evenly spread
 although it would appear that most    
 inhabitants are mainly of adult       
 status.  There are some younger       
 children, schoolchildren and          
 teenagers.  There also exists a very  
 mixed social structure which includes 
 land owners, tenant farmers, bailiffs,
 private home owners and those in      
 rented accommodation.Although there   
 are some service personnel and some   
 newcomers into the area they seem to  
 be well accepted and integrated into  
 the lives and affairs of the          
 community.  The oldest inhabitant is  
 in her nineties. .                    </content>
