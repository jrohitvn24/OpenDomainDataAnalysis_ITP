		<content>  The Yorkshire Dales have been popular
 with tourists for more than a hundred 
 years. Many guide books have been     
 written about the area, though        
 Bellerby is very rarely mentioned. It 
 has very little to attract tourists   
 when compared with the more scenic and
 historically interesting villages such
 as Aysgarth, Middleham and Bainbridge.
 However, in recent years many people  
 have begun to provide bed and         
 breakfast and self-catering           
 accommodation for visitors and so some
 tourists use Bellerby as a base from  
 which to explore other places.        
  The Dales have become even more      
 popular in recent years, particularly 
 to foreign visitors. This is mainly   
 due to the books by James Herriot     
 about his experiences as a vet in the 
 Dales in the thirties and forties.
