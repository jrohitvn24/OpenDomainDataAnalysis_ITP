		<title>04The Village of Ryhope</title>
		<content>    The name{Ryhope}is Saxon. Over the 
 years it has had several different    
 spellings - Reohoffa, Rivehop, Reshop 
 and Riopp. Its meaning is thought to  
 be 'Raef's Rugged Valley' or 'the     
 stream in the valley'.                
    The original settlement is thought 
 to date from{Saxon}times. In 1801 the 
 population of{Ryhope}was 254, not much
 larger than it had been in earlier    
 years. With the opening of the{Pit}in 
 the last century there was a dramatic 
 increase in the population. This was  
 followed by the opening of the{Co-op  
 in 1865. When{Cherry Knowle Hospital  
 opened in 1893 there were three main  
 employers in{Ryhope.}Since the closure
 of the{Pit}in 1966, followed by that  
 of the{Co-op,}much of the pit village 
 character has disappeared. Today most 
 villagers work away from Ryhope and   
 many face the problem of unemployment.</content>
