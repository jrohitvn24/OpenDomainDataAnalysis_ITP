		<content> Most people want to be slim. My mum   
 goes to a slimming club.This is what  
 she told me. At the first visit you   
 are weighed and measured and your     
 "goal"weight is calculated.The club   
 leader provides a diet booklet and    
 explains how to follow it. When every 
 member has been weighed, the meeting  
 begins.First the leader calls out     
 names and weight loss of everyone     
 present.If however,weight has been    
 gained in the past week,you do not    
 have to be idenified.Next there is a  
 discussion on various topics e.g.     
 eating out in restaurants, at friends 
 or on holiday, how to avoid situations
 which tempt you to over_eat and break 
 your diet.It is easier to diet as a   
 part of a group because you find      
 others have simular problems.It must  
 work,some people have lost three      
 stone.                                </content>
