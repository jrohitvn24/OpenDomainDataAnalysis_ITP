 The centre of Woolhope is old but     
 there is a fair amount of new         
 housing.   An unusual feature of the  
 village is that there are walls       
 everywhere and very few hedges.       
 There are several old farmhouses in   
 the surrounding area some dating back 
 600 years.   Farmhouses worth visiting
 for their architectural interest are  
 Croose, Yayers, Court &amp; Hyde farms and
 Terrace Hall which have black &amp; white 
 half-timbering.   Wessington Court, on
 site of earlier manor, is surrounded  
 by beautiful parkland with arboretum &amp;
 has been a wartime hospital and more  
 recently a school for handicapped &amp;   
 deaf children.   It is now being      
 converted into flats.                 
 The Post Office &amp; village shop is in  
 an old cottage, &amp; serves light        
 refreshments.                         </content>
