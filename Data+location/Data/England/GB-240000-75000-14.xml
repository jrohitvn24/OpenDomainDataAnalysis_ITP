		<title>14EMPLOYMENT</title>
		<content> Most employment with the area is based
 upon agriculture, either farming      
 itself or supplying goods or services 
 to farming. The only alternative      
 employment within the area is supplied
 by the garage at Hurlditch Down, the  
 Public House at Chipshop, the caravan 
 site at Woodovis Farm (seasonal),small
 machinery hire and haulage firms in   
 Sydenham Damerel and a small meat     
 processing firm in Portington.        
 A large proportion of the people      
 living in the survey area commute to  
 the local towns and city - Tavistock, 
 Lanceston and Plymouth.               
 Quite a number of people are self-    
 employed either in small businesses or
 as contracting agricultural workers.  
 Unemployment is quite low and there is
 a small proportion of retired people.
