		<title>15Games children play</title>
		<content>  We were trying to find out the most  
 popular games that people play in the 
 playground or on the school field.    
  We did a survey of all the children  
 in our school and gave them lots of   
 choices of games. Some of these       
 you might not of heard of such as     
{bulldog, buzz, stuck in the mud.      
  We found that{football}was the most  
 popular game with the boys the second 
 most popular was{rounders},chosen by  
 boys and girls.A lot of girls liked   
{leapfrog}and{stuck in the mud}and     
{cricket}.                             
  One game you may not have heard of is
{Space Invaders}To play you need a ball
 and at least 3 people.You also need a 
 wall for the background.In the game   
 you have to throw the ball,and if it  
 hits a person then they are out.The   
 winner is the last person left and    
 they become the thrower next time.    </content>
