		<title>03ST. GEORGES LOWER SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Our school is a lower school. It is   
 quite a big school. It has eight      
 classrooms. It has seven classes and a
 spare classroom where we do music and 
 keep things that everyone shares. We  
 have got a computer at school and     
 each class takes it in turn to have it
 and we play lots of nice games on it. 
 We have a headmaster. All the other   
 teachers are ladies. We start lessons 
 at 9 o'clock. We sing first in        
 assembly and then we do work. We do   
 very nice things in our classes. Most 
 people like physical education best.  
 We have a playtime in the morning and 
 the afternoon and a lunch hour. Most  
 people stay to school dinners or eat  
 sandwichs at school. We have a library
 and we have librarians who look after 
 it. They are chosen from children in  
 class 6. We learn maths and           
 timetables. We have a swimming pool.  </content>
