     Industry is  predominantly light  
 engineering  and  manufacturing  in   
 nature, the  19th  century  heavy     
 industry having declined or moved from
 the area.  Only  one coalmine is still
 operating, Bold  Colliery,  and  one  
 glassworks,  United Glass Bottleworks.
 Another  glass  works  has  recently  
 closed  with  the  loss  of  several  
 hundred jobs. Two chemical works have 
 also  closed  within  the  past  five 
 years, following  complaints  from    
 residents living nearby. Although this
 may have  been  a  contributary factor
 the  cause  of  closure  can  also  be
 attributed  to  the  present  economic
 climate  in  the  country  as a whole.
     There is  also a  coal fired Power
 Station  at  Bold,  adjacent  to Bold 
 Colliery.
