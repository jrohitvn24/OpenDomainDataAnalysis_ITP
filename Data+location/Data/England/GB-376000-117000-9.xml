		<title>09Shopping in Marnhull.</title>
		<content>  Marnhull has two grocery shops,one   
 butcher,newsagent,baker,chemist,a     
 paper/sweet/tobacco shop and two      
 garages.Several small towns are 4/6   
 miles away and larger towns 15/30     
 miles distant.More than 50% of the    
 population of Marnhull is retired.    
  Most people have MILK delivered from 
 the dairy in the next village.        
 About 50 fetch their own,some from    
 the farm in the village.              
  The local paper man provides most of 
 the PAPERS,but only about half have   
 the paper delivered.Perhaps retired   
 people like to collect their own?     
  The two GROCERY shops are used 6     
 times more for small purchases than   
 shops outside the village,and         
 although they are more expensive,more 
 than 100 families use them for large  
 grocery purchases.Otherwise these are 
 mainly made at Yeovil &amp; Sturminster.  </content>
