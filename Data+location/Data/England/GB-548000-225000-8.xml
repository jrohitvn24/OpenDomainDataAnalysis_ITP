 Bobs and Excuses is a game where you  
 have one person who turns away with   
 their back to the other people that   
 are playing. Then you take it in turns
 to put your hands on the persons      
 back. That person says five bobs five 
 excuses or something like that but it 
 all has to come to ten. Then the      
 person who had his back to the other  
 people chases. If he or she gets near 
 you, you can either say bob and bob   
 down or say an excuses like "I've     
 broken my leg" then you can't run     
 until someone hits you. You can only  
 use your amount of bobs and excuses   
 when the person catches someone the   
 person who he or she has caught is{It.
