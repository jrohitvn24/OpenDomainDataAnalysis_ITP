		<title>05PETROCKSTOWE PEOPLE</title>
		<content> There are some 300 inhabitants, with l
 child for every 3 adults &amp; 3 males per
 2 females,adult or child.58% of adults
 are Devon born,most within 15 miles of
{Petrockstowe}if not actually from the 
 village,&amp; most are of Devon stock back
 through 3 or 4 generations. Those born
 in Hatherleigh (6 miles) regard them- 
 selves as"outsiders" &amp; South Devonians
 are{definitely}foreigners! The real   
 outsiders come from as far afield as  
 Tyneside/Yorkshire or Kent/Sussex, the
 largest hailing from London &amp; Surrey. 
 Generally they have been here only 10 
 years &amp; came as they love the county  
 or wanted to quit the "rat race".There
 are no coloured residents. The largest
 age group is 41-60yrs but the 26-40s  
 is the second largest. The smallest   
 group is 16-25,far outnumbered by both
 4-10s &amp; 11-16s &amp; even by the infants. 
 It seems schoolleavers leave the area.</content>
