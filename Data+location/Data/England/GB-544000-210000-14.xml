		<title>14OLD HARLOW SHOPPING PRECINCT</title>
		<content> Before the New Town,{Old Harlow}was   
 the main shopping centre.Attitudes of 
 shopkeepers have changed since the    
 High Street was closed to traffic and 
 made a{pedestrian precinct.}This was  
 one of the better changes, but even   
 with the modernisation of shops (self 
 -service and health regulations) the  
 'olde worlde charm' still exists in   
 certain parts of the village including
 shops.Many of the shopkeepers believe 
 that the building of the{Harvey Centre
 in the new town has made a vast       
 difference to the spending power in   
 the village as a whole.Some even      
 believe that trade is slowly dying and
 in order to bring more custom to the  
 village ,there will have to be some   
 major changes in the future ,but what 
 is uncertain.One question people are  
 asking is "Will the development of    
{Stansted Airport}affect it ?"         </content>
