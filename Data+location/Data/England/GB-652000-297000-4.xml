The Â£Mustard King' bought Cliffe House,
in Corton in 1869. He spent many       
thousands of pounds on the house, and  
then turned his attention to sea       
defences. He built a sea wall and      
promenade in 1897. At about the same   
time he provided Corton with its       
Village Hall and United Methodist      
Chapel, and he was the main            
contributor to the fund for building a 
School. He built many of the houses in 
Corton for his staff. You can still    
see J.J.C. inscribed on the            
brickwork. Cliffe House was eventually 
demolished in 1917, but the gardens    
were sold and became one of Cortons    
first holiday attractions. The gardens 
are now covered with undergrowth.
