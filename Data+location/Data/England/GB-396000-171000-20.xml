 British and Foreign coins and three   
 bank notes. I have a 1000 Forint note 
 from Hungary,a 250 mil note from      
 Cyprus,and a 100 dinar note from

   One unusual coin is a square one    
 from India.The biggest coin I have    
 comes from Canada.I have a Barbados   
 dollar,it is the shape of a British   
 fifty pence piece.The oldest coin in  
 my collection is a French one,it was  
 minted in 1854.                       
    I have some coins from the Falkland
 Islands.A British Petty Officer       
 brought them for me.He was serving on 
 H.M.S.Invincible during the Falklands 
 war,between Britain and Argentina,    
 1982.
