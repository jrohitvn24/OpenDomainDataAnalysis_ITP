		<title>06Buddens Skylark Coaches</title>
		<content> This is a family business taken over  
 from the carrier Mr.H.Pragnell in 1926
 -then it had two buses, one a Vulcan  
 with solid tyres.Seats were removed   
 for goods and a crate fitted to the   
 rear for chickens.                    
   To-day Mr.P.Budden and family have  
 28 coaches based on three depots at   
 West Tytherley,Romsey and Woodfalls.An
 international service is provided for 
 holiday makers travelling to most     
 parts of Europe including Moscow.'Pop 
 groups' are taken on tour.Coaches are 
 run for local and National events.In  
 school terms pupils are transported   
 daily to school and often to swimming 
 pools,such as Andover.                
   To this day the coaches continue to 
 serve the village of West Tytherley   
 with a service to Salisbury, as the   
 carrier did in the past.
