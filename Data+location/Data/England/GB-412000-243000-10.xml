 We saw a large seed drill which needed
 a powerful tractor to pull it. In the 
 buildings there was also a plough and 
 disc harrow. Outside were several     
 other kinds of harrow for breaking up 
 the soil.

 This vehicle cuts wheat. Inside it's  
 like a stomach: it cuts the stems,    
 chews the corn, which then goes up an 
 elevator and shoots out into a trailer
 which is pulled by a tractor          
 alongside. Its cab is quite big. It is
 not built fore speed. It makes 940    
 cuts per minute at 31 to 67 rpm. The  
 cutter has a double sickle that gives 
 a clean cut. The straw drops out at   
 the back.                             </content>
