		<title>10Our Lady Queen of Martyrs.</title>
		<content> We visited the Church and discovered  
 the following-                        
 St. Mary's was built in 1871 and is   
 114 years old. St. Mary's was         
 consecrated in 1895. There are statues
 of the Sacred Heart, the Pieta and    
 Mary Queen of Martyrs. The frieze     
 behind the altar shows the 7 Sorrows  
 of Our Lady. The two Saints on the    
 altar are of St. Charles Borromeo and 
 St. Philip Neri. In the churchyard    
 there is a cross and it is the grave  
 of Father Fortin,founder of our       
 parish.The oldest gravestone is about 
 1806.The oldest gravestones are       
 nearest the church.Most of us have    
 ancestors buried there.               
   St.John Boste is our local saint.One
 day he was saying Mass at Waterhouses,
 the home of Mr.William Caxton.He was  
 betrayed by one of the congregration, 
 taken to Durham and York and executed.</content>
