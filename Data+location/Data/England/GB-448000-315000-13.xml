		<title>13BROOK FARM HOUSE, L'BORO</title>
		<content> In our D-block the oldest building    
 appears to be what is now called Brook
 Farm House.The house was built in two 
 periods and the old part is mentioned 
 in the first Domesday Book.The new    
 part was built around the seventeenth 
 century.The walls are made of         
 Charnwood granite.The ground floor is 
 made of stone,the ceilings are made of
 wattle and daub,it is built on three  
 levels.Electricity was put in during  
 the Second World War.The present      
 owners are not farmers.The garage used
 to be a cowshed.The wildlife at Brook 
 Farm includes kingfishers &amp; wood-     
 peckers.A stream runs through the one 
 acre of garden.Along the banks one can
 see the homes of the water voles.There
 are two rare flowers- the cowslip &amp;   
 the wild primrose.
