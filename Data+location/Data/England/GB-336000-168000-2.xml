		<title>02BLIND YEO RIVER.</title>
		<content> The{Blind Yeo River}runs from {Blagdon
{Lake}to the {Bristol Channel}at the   
{West End of Clevedon.}It is called    
 Blind because it does not run into {  
 the sea.It has been blocked off and   
 had its course recut to stop flooding.
 The baliff of the river told us that  
 there are eels,perch,roach,pike,tench,
 bream,lamprey and dab in the slow     
 running water. Millers thumb,stickle  
 backs,rainbow trout,brown trout and   
 goudgen prefer the medium flowing     
 water. The most popular fish to catch 
 is the {perch.                        
                                       
 The baliffs job can be pleasant       
 especially as most baliffs enjoy      
 fishing themselves but the worst part 
 is when someone is caught fishing     
 without a licence and the courts can  
 confiscate the fishing tackle.
