		<title>11UPPER CALDECOTE, BEDS.</title>
		<content> The word Caldecote means literally    
 'cold cottages' and results from the  
 exposed situation of the village.     
 Upper Caldecote is basically a linear 
 village along its two main roads, but 
 the ancient green still survives.     
 There are about 1600 villagers. There 
 is no industry, but there are many    
 thriving agricultural &amp; horticultural 
 businesses concerned with both the    
 growing &amp; selling of produce. There   
 are 3 general shops, including a Post 
 Office/Stores, a hairdresser, florist,
 &amp; several farm shops. The Church and  
 Chapel, the modern VC lower school &amp;  
 the 2 public houses are all in the    
 central part of the village. Housing  
 is divided fairly equally between     
 older terraced &amp; villa type homes, &amp;  
 modern houses built in the last 20-30 
 years. There are no architectural     
 features of outstanding merit.        </content>
