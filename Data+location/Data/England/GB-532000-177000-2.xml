		<title>0205340178: Housing Bermondsey</title>
		<content> Virtually the whole of this area      
 consists of post-war council housing. 
 In the southern half of the block the 
 Victorian terraces have completely    
 disappeared and have been replaced by 
 high-rise and medium-rise blocks in   
 which the local community has been    
 rehoused. the Tower blocks around     
 Avondale square are visible from most 
 of the area.                          
 In the northern half of the block     
 there are still some Victorian        
 terraces of two-story maisonettes.    
 There is also a 1980's development of 
 high density single-unit small        
 terraced houses.                      
 Across the centre of the block runs a 
 belt of disused, derelict marshalling 
 yards belonging to British Rail.      
 Southwark Park Road is the major      
 shopping centre, being lined with     
 shops of every description.           </content>
