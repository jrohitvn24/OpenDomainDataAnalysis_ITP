		<title>08BRADFIELD COLLEGE THEATRE</title>
		<content> Bradfield College is an               
 independent school catering for       
 boys and a few girls in the 6th       
 form.The famed feature of the school  
 is its open air theatre.In the 1880's 
 a chalk pit was extended and made into
 an imitation of the amphitheatre at   
 Epidauros.Every three years a         
 performance of a Greek play is put on 
 in Greek by the boys of the College.  
 In 1985 Sophocles' Antigone was       
 performed.The boys were selected to   
 take part by a series of auditions.In 
 the first they were given a passage by
 Shakespeare to recite to see if they  
 had the necessary dramatic presence.  
 In the second the Classics Master     
 spoke some passages in Greek which the
 boys had to imitate. Finally the      
 boys' singing ability was assessed as 
 the Chorus chanted its lines. The     
 performance was very successful.      </content>
