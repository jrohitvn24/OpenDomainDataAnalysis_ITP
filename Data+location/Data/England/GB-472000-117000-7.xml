		<content> The proportion of woodland to farmland
 is unusually high in this section of  
 the South Downs, probably 50/50. These
 woodlands are in large blocks and     
 their ownership is fairly equally     
 divided between the State in the form 
 of Forestry Commission (which owns    
 the Queen Elizabeth Forest) and       
 private estates or farms. Speceis     
 generally grown are beech, ash, pine, 
 fir, spruce and a wide variety of     
 minor speceis. Most of the produce,   
 resulting from these woodlands is     
 transported by lorry to pulp mills in 
 Gloucestershire or Kent. There is only
 one sawmill at Buriton and this is a  
 specialist mill using larch timber    
 imported for the production of larch- 
 lap fences. It is sited in an old     
 chalk pit. Approximately 15 people    
 depend on forestry for a living within
 the study.                            </content>
