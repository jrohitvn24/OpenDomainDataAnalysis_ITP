 recreational facilities. There are    
 several council owned football        
 pitches, a swimming pool and squash   
 courts, a youth centre, a cricket     
 ground, a public park and play areas. 
 In New Mills there is a junior

 team who have their own pitch and in  
 the winter the youth centre. The New  
 Mills senior team is the Millers. The 
 swimming pool in New Mills is used by 
 the public as well as the schools and 
 other organisations. Every third      
 Saturday they have an inflatable      
 monster to play on. There are squash  
 courts at the swimming pool and on    
 Hibbert Street near the Marina. There 
 are 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th,5th and 6th
