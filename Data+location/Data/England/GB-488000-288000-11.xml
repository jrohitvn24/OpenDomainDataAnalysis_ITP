		<title>11Wonderworld, Corby</title>
		<content>The answer to unemployment in Corby    
would be the development of Wonderworld
a 21st century themepark. Wonderworld  
is the idea of a company called Group  
Five Holdings, who propose to turn a   
vast area of exhausted ironworkings at 
Weldon into the European equivalent of 
America's Disneyland. The theme park   
was supposed to have been started two  
years ago but the planners claim that  
difficulties in raising the capital    
required for the first stage- over 100m
pounds and the lack of a major bank to 
deal with the project have delayed     
this. Many local people are very       
sceptical that it will ever be built,  
although Corby District Council assure 
us that it will.                       
The park is designed to include high-  
technology computerised games and      
leisure facilities, a golf course      
designed by the famous Jack Nicklaus   </content>
