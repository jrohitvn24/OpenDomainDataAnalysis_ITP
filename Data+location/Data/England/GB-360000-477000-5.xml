		<title>05INDUSTRY IN KIRKBY LONSDALE</title>
		<content> Large scale industry has never been a 
 feature of Kirkby Lonsdale area.In    
 previous centuries a small quantity of
{coal}was mined on Casterton Fell.     
 Various{village crafts}were also      
 practised but these too have largely  
{disappeared.}One remaining today is   
 the village{blacksmith}, and the      
 smithy now thrives under new ownership
 after the death of Jonty Wilson.      
 Born in 1893 he would captivate his   
 listeners with tales of the days when 
 the blacksmith used to three fires in 
 his smithy and a good blacksmith could
 deal with{40 horses a day.}In his old 
 age he was much in demand for the     
 quality iron goods he produced.In the 
 1970's and the 1980's there has been  
 some revival of small village crafts  
 such as{pottery},but these are family 
 or small businesses and have little   
 effect on the{employment situation.   </content>
