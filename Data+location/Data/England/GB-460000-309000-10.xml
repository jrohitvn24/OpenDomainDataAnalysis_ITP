		<title>10Barkby houses.</title>
		<content>   Another reminder of the past is a   
 blacksmith's forge that is still      
 working and one or two houses the     
 still have thatched roofs.            
                                       
   Most of the houses are farmworkers' 
 cottages and were built of brick in   
 the nineteenth century. The different 
 brick colours were used to create     
 patterns which make the houses look   
 very nice. They have slate roofs and  
 some have specially shaped chimney    
 stacks calld "Queen" chimneys. Most of
 the houses are joined together to form
 'terraces' and have no front gardens  
 but the front door has steps leading  
 straight onto the pavement.           
                                       
   Many of the walls around the village
 are made of granite from the local    
 quarries at Mountsorrel.
