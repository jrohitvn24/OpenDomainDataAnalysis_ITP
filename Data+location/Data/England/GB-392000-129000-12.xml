 Cuttings with about six buds are taken
 from the best vines. The cuttings have
 to be{one year old}before they can be 
 planted out.                          
   The vines grow{two metres high}and  
 the rows are planted{eight feet apart 
 so that the sun can get to the grapes.
 The plants are{five feet apart.}The   
 grapes are only up to{eighteen inches 
 above the ground and the rest is      
 leaves. They have to be planted out in
 straight lines. Each line is numbered 
 and each row is labelled, when planted
 and the variety of grape.             
   The variety of grapes grown are     
{Riesling, Sylvaner, Seyval Blanc}and  
{Reihenstener.}The juice from these is 
 blended together to produce the wine. 
   The vines do not mind how cold it is
 in the winter but they cannot survive 
 late Spring frosts.                   </content>
