		<content>    The largest village in our area is 
 Weston Underwood.  It consists of 2   
 farms, with old farmhouses, 31 houses 
 (28 modern and 3 old), 14 new         
 bungalows and 1 old one, and 13       
 cottages, one of which is the Post    
 Office.  Most of the new houses, which
 were built in the 1970's, were built  
 in what was then farmland.  In several
 gardens we can see signs of ridge and 
 furrow ploughing, which was used in   
 Victorian times to make extra area.   
    The only shop in the village is the
 Post Office, which is in an extension 
 to a cottage, dated 1860.  The        
 extension was originally built for use
 as a garage, but is now used as a     
 shop.  Mrs Sue Gratian deals with 30+ 
 pensions and about 30 family          
 allowances for local people, and takes
 care of all the usual P.O. facilities.
 In addition, she sells greetings      </content>
