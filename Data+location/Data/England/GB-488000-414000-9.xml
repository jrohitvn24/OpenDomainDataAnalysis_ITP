		<title>09Avenue Memories by Mrs.Ward</title>
		<content> During the past few years I have      
 walked along The Avenue on many       
 occasions but my memories go back     
 beyond that.My earliest memories are  
 of a stretch of highway flanked by    
 tall,majestic Elms which met          
 overhead.It was like going through a  
 dark,green tunnel and then emerging   
 into brightness.The trees were planted
 between 1803 and 1805 and were well   
 known as a picturesque beauty spot and
 attracted many tourists.In 1978       
 disaster struck.The trees had to be   
 felled because they were in a         
 dangerous condition due to Dutch Elm  
 disease.The resulting bareness was    
 what struck one the most.Many         
 residents thought the landscape would 
 never be the same again.Replacement   
 trees were planted and the Women's    
 Institute planted daffodils which     
 flower each spring.                   </content>
