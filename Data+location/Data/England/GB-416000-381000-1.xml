		<title>01THE HOPE VALLEY</title>
		<content> The Hope Valley was once a vast inland
 sea.  The deposits left by tiny sea   
 creatures and sediment millions of    
 years ago now make up the limestone   
 and gritstone of the area.            
   Throughout the history of the area, 
 the local landscape has provided      
 employment for the inhabitants.       
 Farming has always been important and 
 is still a major source of income.    
 Lead was mined in the area from at    
 least the time of Roman occupation    
 until about 1900.  Also the gritstone 
 was shaped into millstones at nearby  
 Stanage Edge.  Now Blue Circle Cement 
 is the major employer, using both the 
 limestone and shale to produce cement.
 The main villages of the Valley are   
 Hope, Bradwell, Castleton, Bamford,   
 Hathersage and Edale. The Hope Valley 
 is in the Peak National Park and      
 attracts many tourists.               </content>
