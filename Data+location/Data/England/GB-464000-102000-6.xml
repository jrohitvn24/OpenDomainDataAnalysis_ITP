 I live in  a four bedroomed house.Most
 houses in Portsmouth have 3 bedrooms ,
 and are fitted with modern appliances.
 eg.central heating,television and     
 stereo units.We have a study          
 because our house has been modernized.
 In here we keep our B.B.C. computer   
 and our telephone.My father uses this 
 room to work in.We have a dining room 
 and a lounge like most people.Next to 
 the dining room is our kitchen which  
 has also just been modernized.We have 
 a 25 by 15 foot  garden and in this   
 is a small lawn,a fish pond,a pear and
 a plum tree,a small flower border and 
 a garage.We also have a green_house   
 which my father built.
