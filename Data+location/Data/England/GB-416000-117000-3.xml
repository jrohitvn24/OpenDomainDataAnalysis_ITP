		<content>  THE BUILDING OF HALE HOUSE, WHICH IS 
 MID-WAY BETWEEN HALE AND WOODGREEN,   
 WAS  STARTED  IN 1715, AND A CLOCK    
 PLACED IN THE ROOF IN 1718 IS STILL IN
 WORKING ORDER.                        
  THERE ARE SIXTEEN SERVANTS' ROOMS IN 
 THE ATTIC BUT THE PRESENT OWNERS, WHO 
 ARE IN RESIDENCE FOR ABOUT THREE DAYS 
 A WEEK, EMPLOY ONLY A CLEANER IN THE  
 HOUSE AND A GARDENER OUTSIDE.         
  THERE ARE SEVENTEEN ROOMS IN THE     
 BASEMENT, INCLUDING A GAME LARDER     
 WHERE THEY STILL HANG BIRDS AND       
 VENISON.                              
  THE HOUSE AND PARK ARE OPEN TO THE   
 PUBLIC TEN TIMES A YEAR.              
  THE DRIVE, WHICH LEADS TO THE FRONT  
 DOOR, IS THE LONGEST STRAIGHT LIME    
 TREE AVENUE IN ENGLAND. IT IS ONE MILE
 LONG AND THE TREES ARE AT LEAST 200   
 YEARS OLD.                            
                                       </content>
