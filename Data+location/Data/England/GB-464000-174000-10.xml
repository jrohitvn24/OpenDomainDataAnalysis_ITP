		<content>  Sulham Wood was originally beech     
 woodland.It has now fine examples of  
 oak,beech,poplar,Norway Maple,Douglas 
 fir,Red cedar,Western hemlock,among   
 many others.Some of the flowers we    
 have seen in our walks include        
 primroses,dog violets and ecstensive  
 areas of blue_bells and buttercups.   
  Traces of rabbits,badgers and foxes  
 have been seen.Squirrels are there in 
 large numbers and occasionally deer   
 step daintily between the trees.      
  There are a number of families of    
 Jays,Magpies and Green Woodpeckers    
 there and we believe that we have seen
 a Yellow_Hammer flying near the       
 road.Owls and Pheasants are abundant  
 and Tits and Finches can often be     
 seen.
