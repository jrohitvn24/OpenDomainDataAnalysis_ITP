		<content> The bulk of the woods are made up of  
 various varieties of coniferous trees 
 as these are commercially viable.     
 There are Douglas Firs which are the  
 best, at the lower levels and Sitka   
 Spruce and Larches higher up.The      
 Forestry Commission tries to break up 
 large areas of the same trees both for
 forestry hygiene and to improve the   
 attractiveness of the area.           
                                       
 Approximately a quarter of a million  
 trees are planted here every year and 
 are felled on average when they are 25
 metres tall and 45 years old.The      
 thinnings go for pulp,chipboard and   
 firewood,the better wood for fencing  
 and the best wood for building works.
