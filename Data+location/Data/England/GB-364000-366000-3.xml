		<title>03Playground games for girls</title>
		<content>    Four ten year old girls wrote a    
 list of playground games on a big     
 piece of paper.We chose forty games   
 and went to the 1st year girls.We     
 asked for six girls to interview.We   
 asked them which four games they would
 like to choose from the list.We went  
 to other classes and did the same     
 again and discovered that the most    
 popular playground games were:        
{                                      
{1.LEAP FROG 2.BULLDOG 3.BOYS AFTER    
{GIRLS 4.STUCK IN THE MUD. }           
                                       
    These are traditional games,people 
 played them many years ago.Our        
 teachers remember them and they are   
 very old!
