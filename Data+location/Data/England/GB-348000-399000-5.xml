		<title>05 FARMING:CROPS/LIVESTOCK</title>
		<content>  The main crops at the farms in this  
area are:potatoes,sugarbeet,winter and 
summer barley,wheat,cabbage,carrots and
oilseed rape.Also farmed are peas and  
leeks.                                 
  Some farms have beef cattle e.g.     
Rainford Brook Farm;Rainford Delph     
Farm;Webster's Farm and Promised Land  
Farm which all have 30-40 beef cattle  
each.Red Barn Farm has some sheep and  
Hyde's Brow Farm and Rookery Farm each 
have horses stabled there.             
  Many farms get a subsidy from the EEC
for oilseed rape(used to make margarine
etc.)and some get a cattle subsidy.The 
farmers are affected by having to keep 
to an EEC enforced potato acreage quota
but,not having any dairy cattle,the    
milk quota does not apply.The cattle go
to the abattoir to be slaughtered,and  
the vegetables either go to markets or 
to companies such as Heinz.            </content>
