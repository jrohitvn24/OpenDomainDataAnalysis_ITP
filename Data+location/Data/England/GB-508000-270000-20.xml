		<title>20LOCAL HISTORY IN WEST CAMBS.</title>
		<content>     Change comes slowly to the western
 edge of Cambridgeshire.  The twentieth
 century has made its mark with modern 
 houses and new farming technology; but
 the history of the area is still very 
 much apparent.   The church, thatched 
 cottages and village cross at Stow    
 Longa have changed little since the   
 Middle Ages, while the disused railway
 line and the wartime airfield recall  
 more recent history.   Above all, the 
 Anglo-Saxon place-names of Catworth   
 and Stow Longa are reminders that the 
 first inhabitants settled here long   
 before the time of the original       
 Domesday Book.
