		<title>03FAMILY LIFE IN RADSTOCK</title>
		<content> My family by Kirsty Butt.             
 There are five members in my family,  
 my mother, my father, my brother, my  
 sister and me. We live in Waterloo    
 Road Radstock in the same house that  
 my greatgrandfather used to lodge in  
 when he worked in the mine.           
   My dad works as a printer at Welton 
 bag factory and my mum works at a     
 Playschool in Radstock. My hobbies are
 swimming, stamp collecting,           
 trampolining and reading.My sister    
 also has these hobbies. My brother    
 likes bird watching and goes to a     
 young ornithologist club.             
   Every Saturday we go swimming and   
 trampolining at South Wansdyke Sports 
 Centre, we also go to church every    
 Sunday. Our family goes on at least   
 one holiday a year together but I also
 go on school and guide camps.
