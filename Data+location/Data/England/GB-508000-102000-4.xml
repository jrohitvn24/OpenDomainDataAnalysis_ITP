        Yet more growth in Ferring and 
 Kingston. Durrington, though          
 scattered, was beginning to grow too. 
 It was interesting to note that three 
 farms near Highdown disappeared on    
 this map and reappeared later.  It was
 decided that this most probably was   
 due to an error on the map makers     
 part.                                 
                                       
 1913                                  
       With the coming of the railway  
 in 1845, and of a station in Goring , 
 we expected more change.  The outflow 
 of settlements came later from        
 Worthing though.  Small growth only   
 had taken place in each area.  The    
 woods had beeb further cut into with a
 proper road now through them as there 
 is today.
