		<content>Early memories of Stevenage New Town.  
"I've lived in this house 29 years.We  
were the first to live in it.I thought 
it was lovely. We lived in a small flat
before with no garden.We didn't have   
any pavements .The garden was full of  
bricks,stones and sand left over from  
the builders, so we had a big job      
clearing it up."..."Mud-there was mud  
everywhere!The only shops were in the  
old town where the shop keepers were   
not very friendly,most resented us.    
The first shops were at Rockingham Way.
Before that there was one mobile       
grocer.Also there were no schools for  
the new town.I had to go to St.Nicholas
the old church school.It was cold and  
we used to sit round the fire.I have   
lived in Stevenage for 32 years and    
have seen it grow into a caring        
community with very good facilities."
