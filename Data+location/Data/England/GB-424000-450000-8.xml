		<content>   The{rural home}of the 1980's is     
 usually a{busy place,}father working  
 at home or quite nearby, mother busy  
 in the kitchen or helping outside and 
 the children at school for most of the
 day.                                  
   As children start school at 5       
 continuing until the age of 16,{home  
{life reaches its premium during the   
{school holidays.}Then the{whole family
{work as a team,}down to the youngest  
 member of the family, each having a   
 job to do.                            
   Although all homes have a television
 they rarely sit to watch it,life is   
 too busy, it is watched more during   
 the dark winter months than in        
 summertime. This is where the video   
 recorder comes into its own, favourite
 programmes being recorded for watching
 at a more convenient time.
