		<content>     In this block the southern edge of
the City of Oxford merges into the     
countryside.   The local economy is    
dominated by the {Austin Rover}works at
Cowley.   Many who work there live in  
the two large council estates of       
Blackbird Leys and Rose Hill or in the 
nearby villages of Littlemore,Sandford 
and Kennington.   The Oxford ring-road 
passes from East to West and the road  
from Oxford to Henley passes from North
to South.   So too does the river      
Thames.   All kinds of pleasure boat   
use the river, held up only by the     
need to negotiate two locks at Iffley  
and Sandford.   l00 years ago the whole
area was rural.   Iffley and Cowley,   
now part of Oxford, were villages in   
their own right.   Today Littlemore and
Kennington stand poised to be swallowed
up by Oxford's urban sprawl.
