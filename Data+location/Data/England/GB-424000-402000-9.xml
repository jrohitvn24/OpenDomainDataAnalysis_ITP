		<title>09ST JOHN'S SCHOOL.</title>
		<content>  As part of the Domesday Survey we    
 visited the largest junior school in  
 our area; St John's. This is a Church 
 of England aided school in Penistone  
 itself. We asked the Headmaster Mr    
 Whitfield some questions. There are   
 about 200 pupils in the school and the
 are about equally split between boys  
 and girls. The pupils on the whole are
 well behaved. The schoo; meals are    
 popular and are subsidised. The       
 breakes are long enough. A few        
 children travel by bus to the school  
 but most walk.                        
 The school was opened in 1968 when it 
 moved from its old site next to the   
 church. The old school was opened in  
 1868.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
