		<content> (continued) years ago during a time of
 crisis; the number of members had     
 fallen and the County Youth Service   
 had just withdrawn its payment of a   
 youth worker. Luckily the facilities  
 include, a games hall (large enough   
 for Badmington), sitting              
 room,kitchen,and a room with a        
 pooltable and table tennis table. They
 started with one session a week for   
 the 10 to 18 year age range, but this 
 was later split into two sessions - 10
 to 14 and 15 to 18. Problems with     
 vandalism led to the closure of the   
 session for older children. The       
 younger ones are clearly appreciative 
 of the facilities.                    
 The youth club is an asset which many 
 villages do not have, but the leaders 
 must have more support if the club is 
 to flourish.
