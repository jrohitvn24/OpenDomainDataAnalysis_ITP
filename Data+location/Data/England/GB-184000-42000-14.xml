		<content> Nowadays some people have coloured and
 spikey hair which we cll a "punk"     
 hairstyle.Boys tend to have short hair
 but a few have long hair down to their
 shoulders.Girls have a mixture of long
 and short hair both of which are      
 popular.Some boys have their hair     
 shaved right off.There are not many   
 barbers now who only cut men's        
 hair.Instead there are Unisex hair    
 stylists who cut and style both men   
 and womens hair.r.                    
   We wear a uniform at school.Girls   
 wear a maroon cardigan and grey skirt 
 and boys wear a maroon jumper,maroon &amp;
 gold tie and grey trousers.           
   Out of school boys and girls both   
 wear jeans or "baggies" which are     
 loose trousers with lots of pockets   
 and zips.Girls like to wear earings   
 and so do lots of boys now but we are 
 not supposed to at school.            </content>
