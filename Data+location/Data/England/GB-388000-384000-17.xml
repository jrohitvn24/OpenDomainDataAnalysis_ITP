		<title>17LIKES AND DISLIKES - PART 1</title>
		<content> The thing I like most is watching     
 television. My favourite programme is 
 Dallas. I like it because it's not    
 funny and it's serious.  My favourite 
 food is Italian food because I        
 absolutely love Spaghetti Bolognaise  
 and Pizzas. Another thing I like doing
 best is playing Snooker, but when I   
 play against my dad he always wins by 
 miles. There's other games I like     
 playing such as Beware of the Spider, 
 but the battery has run out. I like   
 playing Connect Four and Tell Me. I   
 really liked Beware of the Spider best
 because the spider jumps up on you    
 when you touch the board with the     
 metal tweezer. My favourite subject at
 school is Reading and English, and    
 Playtimes. Another thing I like doing 
 is eating. When I'm not eating Italian
 Food I like 'hamwiches' and chips.
