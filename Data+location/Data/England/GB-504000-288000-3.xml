		<title>03THE OUNDLE BY-PASS</title>
		<content>   Oundle town_centre has been a       
 bottle-neck for traffc and the road   
 going through the centre was just not 
 big enough. Oundle by-pass will take  
 traffic going on the Peterborough -   
 Northampton road &lt;A605> away from the 
 town. It will follow the route of the 
 old railway-line. It leaves the old   
 road via a new roundabout built to the
 north-east of the town and then       
 rejoins the old road near Barnwell    
 village. The road has to cross the    
 river twice so two bridges are being  
 built. Traffic from the Corby         
 direction will still have to go       
 through the town-centre. Oundle has   
 waited over thirty years for this     
 by-pass.There was much debate about   
 the route to be taken. Some residents 
 are afraid that the loss of traffic   
 will kill the town. Others are looking
 forward to some peace and quiet!      </content>
