		<title>11Dairying at Woodend Farm</title>
		<content>   Mr. Johnson farms a total of three  
 farms, Woodend, Tanhouse, Seedhouse,  
 320 hectares in all.                  
   Woodend is a dairy farm and has 240 
 Friesian cows and 4 bulls - 3 Friesian
 and one Hereford.                     
   In summer the cows live in fields   
 but in winter they are kept in        
 cubicles in an enclosed cowshed.  They
 are fed silage, hay and treated barley
 when grass is not available.  The cows
 are milked twice a day, 16 at a time, 
 about 100 an hour.                    
   The milk is sent through cooling    
 equipment to a 6025 l storage tank and
 kept at 5 C.  Then it is pasteurised  
 and bottled on the farm.  The milk is 
 only exposed to air for about 10      
 seconds when the top is put on it.    
 The equipment is automatically cleaned
 after every usage.  Milk is sold as   
 pasteurised, sterilised and skimmed.  </content>
