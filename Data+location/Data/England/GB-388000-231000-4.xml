		<content>  The medieval fair is an annual event 
 and usually afterwards there is a     
 scene from medieval times.            
  In 1984 and 1985 the scene was from  
 the Battle of Tewkesbury.This took the
 form of a re-enactment to commemorate 
 the Battle,which was in 1471.It was   
 one of the Battles of the Roses.The   
 fair takes place on the Vineyards and 
 over the other side of the river the  
 medieval scene is acted.              
  Both for the fair and the            
 battle,people dress up in authentic   
 costumes.Many traditional crafts are  
 displayed during the afternoon.
