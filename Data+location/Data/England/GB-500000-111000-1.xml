 These twin villages are the centre of 
 habitation and interest with the      
 hamlet of Houghton lying in between.  
 They lie on either side of the River  
 Arun, winding its tidal way through   
 the gap in the South Downs. The       
 villages were once joined until 1964, 
 by a ferry over the river. Now a three
 mile journey by road over Houghton    
 Bridge is involved. Medieval churches 
 face each other over the river,       
 presiding over a still agricultural   
 scene even through mechanisation      
 requires fewer workers. Thus old farm 
 cottages are now combined and         
 renovated to house retired people.    
 Each village is in a different church 
 deanery, local government             
 area,education area etc..There is     
 little social inter-relationship.     </content>
