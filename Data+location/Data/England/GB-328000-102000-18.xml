		<content> In Chardstock there is very little    
 traffic in the village compared to    
 towns like Chard and Axminster.During 
 mornings many lorries pass by         
 including Milk Tankers,Tractors and   
 Heavy Goods vehicles.Most villagers   
 have cars and this makes villagelanes 
 busy.Just recently the roads have a   
 new surface put on over the old one   
 which had pot holes.Going past the    
 village school is the main village    
 road and much of the village traffic  
 goes along this road.The service bus  
 runs from Chard to Axminster and stops
 hourly at Tytherleigh.The bus runs    
 along the Fossway.A private coach bus 
 runs to Axminster and back on market  
 day each Thursday. Another bus runs   
 from the village once a week to Chard.
