		<content> I wake up at about 7.00a.m. and I have
 a yawn and a big stretch. Then I get  
 out of bed and I get my school uniform
 on, I brush my hair and go downstairs 
 to have my breakfast. For breakfast I 
 have weetabix with butter and jam, and
 I have toast. As I live in Oversley   
 Green I go to school in the car with  
 my sisters unless Mummy says that we  
 can cycle. As Daddy is a farmer and is
 usually very busy, Mummy drives us to 
 school.She also cycles with us,we can 
 not go on our own because of my young 
 sister and because we have to go along
 the main Alcester to Stratford road   
 which is very busy. When I get home   
 after school I play until 5.00pm.then 
 we have tea.At 7.00 we get ready for  
 bed,I clean my teeth,wash my hands and
 face. I go to bed to read until 7.30pm
 then I go to sleep.
