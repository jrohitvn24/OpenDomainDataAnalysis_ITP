		<title>08  HAMBLETON C.E. SCHOOL</title>
		<content> In 1872 the old school in Station Road
 was built, consisting of a small      
 infants class and a large room which  
 became 2 classes divided by a sliding 
 screen.It was used for schooling on   
 weekdays but for church sevices on    
 Sundays.At first it had 48 pupils but 
 that rose to 150. However it became   
 over crowded,so it moved in September 
 1973.The new school was built in      
 Gateforth Lane and is still in        
 use.This was an improvement as the    
 school houses 183 children in 6       
 classes and each has 2 toilets.It     
 has a hall which turns into a         
 gymnasium.Its low windows light the   
 room and provide a view of the        
 Hough.We have a colour T.V,computer   
 and video and many other resources.Yet
 perhaps it will seem primitive in many
 hundreds of years.
