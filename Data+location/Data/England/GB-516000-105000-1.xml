 Lancing and Sompting have many good   
 points of interest,infact more than   
 most villages.                        
 There are two churches in the         
 area.Saint James the less is in Manor 
 Road,N Lancing is quite old and has   
 beautiful stained glass windows and   
 tasteful burial grounds.Saint Mary's  
 Church of Sompting,is the oldest Saxon
 church in Britain.It is just as       
 interesting if not better than Saint  
 James,Saint Mary's is situated by the 
 A27,which runs through the two        
 villages.Lancing is mainly for old    
 people but there are some very good   
 sporting facilities.                  
 There is the Manor Leisure Centre and 
 the manor itself,which has all sorts  
 of sports.                            
 The Adur Leisure mobile also runs     
 activities._                          </content>
