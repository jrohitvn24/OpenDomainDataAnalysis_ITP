		<content>   Fruit is sized by diameter using a  
 ring guage system in steps of 5 or    
 10mm. Pears are sized by hand.In      
 large packhouses apple sizing is      
 mechanised.At Tibbs Court bulk bins   
 are lowered into water which carries  
 the apples to a conveyor,small fruit  
 falls through a mesh. Checkers remove 
 damaged or badly blemished fruit then 
 apples pass through holes of adjusted 
 sizes,and collect in separate boxes.  
 The apples are graded for quality and 
 packed into cartons or bags.          
   Grade 1 fruit is the best quality,  
 Grade 2 may be slightly blemished,    
 riper,or misshapen.Sound ungraded     
 fruit may be sold for juice or cider  
 or used in mincemeat,baby foods etc.  
   Packing gives employment for many   
 months as fruit is kept in cold stores
 until marketed.
