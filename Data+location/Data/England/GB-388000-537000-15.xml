		<title>15WEARDALE: HEALTH RISKS</title>
		<content>   People in St Johns Chapel and       
 Westgate are worried about the        
 proposal to close the ambulance       
 station at weekends.It is open on week
 days but if you have an accident at   
 the weekend you might have to wait    
 until an ambulance comes from Crook   
 which is 20 miles away . Then there is
 an extra journey to Bishop Auckland   
 Hospital which is 26 miles away.      
{  Weadale might be chosen by the      
{Goverment to bury nuclear waste       
{because of the very deep lead mines in
{the area. They could bring over 1     
{million tonnes of nuclear waste in the
{next 15 years.The people are concerned
{because they fear it might pollute the
{water and cause diseases like cancer. 
                                       
    The local people have formed action
 groups to fight both of these         
 possibilities.                        </content>
