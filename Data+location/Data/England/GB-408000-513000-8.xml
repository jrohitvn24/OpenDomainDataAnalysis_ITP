		<title>08THE MORRITT ARMS</title>
		<content> The coaching days of the 18th century 
 saw the opening up of the road from   
 Scotch Corner to Penrith as a main    
 route in the link between Glasgow and 
 London.  Greta Bridge was one of the  
 recognised stopping places with three 
 coaching inns in the village. Railways
 took much traffic from the roads so   
 the Morritt Arms is the only one left.
 In 1920 it was much modernised to take
 advantage of the fact that cars were  
 bringing traffic back to the roads. By
 1960 traffic was so heavy it posed its
 own threat to trade.  But now the     
 village is by-passed.                 
 Now the Morritt Arms is a quiet hotel 
 of character, close to a busy main    
 road, but with good access and        
 parking. It welcomes the locals, the  
 passing traveller and increasingly    
 functions such as weddings and party  
 bookings or commercial gatherings.    </content>
