		<content> The River Test is well known for      
 some of the best trout fishing in the 
 country, and the section which runs   
 through the block is very typical of  
 the river.  The river is divided into 
 three stretches of fishing rights     
 owned by three separate concerns      
 Brook stretch _ let by Compton Estate;
 Lower Brook stretch _ privately owned 
 by local land_owner at Lower Brook;   
 Mottisfont stretch _ owned by Humbert 
 Syndicate.                            
 The fishing is mainly for trout with  
 some salmon. The river has been       
 carefully channelled for centuries    
 with fishing in mind and is well      
 managed at the present day, being     
 annually cleared out and restocked,   
 with coarse fish removed.             
 Beats are expensive to rent, fees     
 being between Â£40 and Â£70 per day.    
 Waterfowl on the river are common.    </content>
