		<title>02LOWDHAM C.E. PRIMARY SCHOOL.</title>
		<content>   Lowdham Primary School is divided   
 into two parts,the old school and the 
 new school.The two buildings are one  
 hundred and fifty metres apart.       
   This causes incovenience because the
 games field and dining hall are up at 
 the new school and you have to walk up
 and down for games and dinners.       
   The old school is Victorian and     
 parts of it are falling down.It is    
 divided into five buildings.The       
 largest is occupied by classes 3 and  
 5. Another holds class 4 and the      
 library.Then there is the school house
 where they store costumes and jumble  
 and the teachers have their tea.There 
 is a toilet block and the caretakers  
 storeroom.                            
   The new school is all one building  
 and houses the two infant classes.
