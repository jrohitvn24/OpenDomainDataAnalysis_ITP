		<content>    In our square we found out that 61%
 of the area covered was houses, 34%   
 was rough grazing, and 5% was         
 deciduous woodland made up of oak,    
 beech, sycamore and horse chestnut.   
 The village of Galmpton is mainly made
 up of retired wealthy people and a few
 holiday homes, there are a few who    
 commute to the STC factory and service
 industries.                           
    There is a C of E Primary School in
 the middle of the village.            
    The village pub the 'Manor Inn' has
 a restaurant attached and people      
 travel from miles around. It has a few
 shops to serve the locality.
