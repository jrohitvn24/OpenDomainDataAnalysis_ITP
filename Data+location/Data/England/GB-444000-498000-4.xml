		<title>04A WALK IN OUR D-BLOCK</title>
		<content> We walked up Ruebury Lane and instead 
 of turning up to Lady Chapel we       
 stopped to look at the view.On the    
 west was A.19,Ingleby Arncliffe was   
 north,Osmotherley south and on the    
 east was moorland.It was slightly     
 misty so we couldn't see very well.We 
 walked to Chapel Wood farm and along  
 to the forest.On either side of us    
 were conifer trees,many were dead.    
 Sometimes you could see light but     
 apart from that it was very dark. We  
 had to be careful because it was muddy
 and slippery. Eventually we came out  
 into the open again, high above the   
 surrounding countryside. We looked    
 right over the forest to the grassland
 and farms below. We could also see the
 Tontine and the reservoir. We then    
 walked eastwards to join the road     
 leading to the booster station but we 
 turned south, back towards Osmotherley</content>
