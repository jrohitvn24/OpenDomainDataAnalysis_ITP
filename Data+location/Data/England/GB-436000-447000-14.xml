		<title>14WETHERBY HEALTH CENTRE</title>
		<content> The centre is open five days a week   
 and one hour on Saturday. When closed 
 an answering service puts you through 
 to a doctor. Attached to the centre   
 there are four doctors, four district 
 nurses, three SENs, three health      
 visitors, one practice nurse, two     
 midwives, two school nurses and two   
 family planning nurses. The clinics   
 held are: Family Planning, Ante-Natal,
 Red Cross, Immunisation, Well Woman,  
 Speech Therapy, Baby Clinic, Audiology
 and Dietetics. It is obvious that the 
 centre is always busy, with over 100  
 people attending daily. The main aim  
 is to educate people about keeping fit
 and healthy and also to screen for    
 early detection of illnesses, so that 
 the necessary treatment can be quickly
 administered. Small stitching can be  
 done at the centre but anything more  
 serious is sent to the hospital.      </content>
