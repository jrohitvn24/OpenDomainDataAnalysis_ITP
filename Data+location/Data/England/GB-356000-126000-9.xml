		<content>        There are no major roads in our
 area, most of the roads are thin, and 
 the verges are overgrown with grass   
 and weeds, and these have ruts on     
 either side.                          
        As there are not enough roads  
 for the farmer to get to all of his   
 fields without ruining his crops,     
 farmers have built their own tracks   
 out of loose stones and many of       
 these tracks can be found in our area.
 The tracks have deep ruts on either   
 side due to the heavy weight of the   
 tractors.                             
        A large quantity of the roads  
 or tracks in the area are actually    
 footpaths which are widely used by the
 people most of the time when they do  
 not want to go too far.               
        Generally there are very few   
 well kept roads or tracks.
