		<content> There have been many changes in our   
 area in the last twenty years.  The   
 High Street is very different.  There 
 was an ABC Cinema where Safeways is   
 now, the market was the site of old   
 shops in character with the area, the 
 Victorian Police Station was replaced 
 by a bigger, modern building.  Many   
 old shops no longer exist.  Part of   
 the High Street is pedestrianised with
 benches and flower tubs.  The offices 
 of Honeywell and the garage were built
 after houses were demolished.         
 Supermarkets like the Co-op have been 
 built with car parks behind them.     
 Some of the old pubs have been        
 demolished and replaced.  A new       
 housing estate has been built at the  
 Lyndhurst.  It is no longer safe to go
 out at night as muggings and attacks  
 are more common in the area.
