		<title>02Facilities for old people</title>
		<content>  We went to see a retired couple to   
 interview them. This is what they     
 said. There  are quite alot of        
 services for old people,things like   
 "meals on wheels" home nursing or     
 "home help".                          
  If you want a bus pass you would     
 pay one pound and when you show it to 
 the bus driver you only pay half      
 price.If you couldn't do your         
 decorating the Local Authority would  
 do it for you. It would be one room   
 a year. To go to the cinema for old   
 people it would be half price in the  
 afternoon. A hobby of old people is   
 going to Bingo and it is cheaper.     
  At{Prettygate library}old people have
 a special sevice.  A yellow van goes  
 to their house .The library have a    
 list of people who can't get out of   
 their houses .The van goes every 1 or 
 2 weeks . They also have special books</content>
