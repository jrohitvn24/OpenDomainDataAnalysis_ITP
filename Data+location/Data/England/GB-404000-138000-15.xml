		<title>15Living in a village</title>
		<content> If you live in a village it is good   
 because you can make friends better   
 and more quickly.Also you have more   
 room to have a garden. You can go for 
 walks in woods and fields and there   
 are animals.You are very lucky if you 
 live in a village because at night you
 can get to sleep but in a town you    
 can't because of the traffic. You can 
 picnic in a village but in a town you 
 can't because there are fumes and too 
 many cars. (Louise....9yrs.old)       
                                       
 I like it in the village because it   
 is quieter and it is pretty. There is 
 a lot of grass to play on.            
 There is one thing that I don't like  
 about our village.  It has not got any
 shops so if you have not got a car you
 cannot go shopping. (Lisa..7yrs.old)
