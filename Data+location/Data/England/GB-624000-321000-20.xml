		<content> There is no heavy industry in the area
 at all, the main industry being       
 farming. However there are several    
 small firms that employ people from   
 the locality.                         
 The Mill at Buxton employs one or two 
 people as does the hotel attached to  
 it.                                   
 In Lammas there is a pet food         
 wholesalers which employs about a     
 dozen people.                         
 The largest place of employment by far
 is R.A.F. Coltishall which employs a  
 large number of civilians from the    
 area.
