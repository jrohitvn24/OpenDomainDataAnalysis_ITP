		<title>07Allenton Market, Derby</title>
		<content> Allenton Market is an open air market 
 with a covering roof over about fifty 
 permanent stalls. These have wooden   
 tops and legs which hold up both the  
 table tops and the corrugated roofs.  
 It is open on Fridays and Saturdays   
 when it sells groceries, shoes, fruit 
 and vegetables, clothes and toys.Most 
 people shop here instead of the nearby
 shops because the market is much      
 cheaper.                              
   On Tuesday nights there is a{Flea   
{Market,}which is like a huge jumble   
 sale. People take second-hand clothes,
 furniture, toys etc. Some traders     
 bring their own tables and things on  
 Tuesdays because there isn't enough   
 room on the ordinary tables for all   
 their goods.
