		<title>09THURLASTON WINDMILL</title>
		<content>The mill was last used 1910.The sails, 
removed in 1931 for $20 were used to   
make the gates of the building.They    
have been replaced by metal ones now.  
When the mill stopped they made meals. 
One lady remembers paying 2d for       
Sunday dinner and cake.                
The windmill has six floors including  
a basement.It has nine rooms,a small   
bedroom,living room, kitchen,dining    
room,study,bedroom/toilet,             
bathroom/toilet. Fire risk is          
high because it is too tall to have    
fire doors.On every floor there is a   
fire extinguisher or fire blanket.     
It seemed a funny place to live.It     
would be difficult to get furniture up 
the round stairs.It is also damp and   
hard to heat up.
