		<title>15Birket Houses</title>
		<content> Birket Houses built in 1908, is an    
 example of a new trend in holidays. To
 live in lovely rooms and to be        
 surrounded by gardens of 20 acres     
 where there are still red squirrels,  
 deer and where hens lay free renge    
 eggs, goats and the family cows supply
 the dairy food, is to enjoy life in   
 the country which was fast            
 dissappearing. In complete and        
 satisfactory contrast to the new cell 
 like modern motels with their bare    
 walls, modern furniture, "colour TV   
 and mod cons", here there is oak      
 panelling, even a four poster bed in  
 some bedrooms, wide and comfortable   
 window seats, with superb views even  
 in the winter, and yet warm central   
 heating, plenty of hot water, subtle  
 electric lighting.
