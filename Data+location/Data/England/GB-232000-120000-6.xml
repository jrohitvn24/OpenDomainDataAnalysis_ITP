		<content>  This part of Devon with its generous 
 rainfall,has long been a green and    
  pleasant land for dairy cattle but   
 the European Economic Community Quota 
 policy  has  led to many farmers      
 having to decrease there herd and some
 looking to other forms of farming for 
 their income.                         
    Some have large herds of sheep.    
    At Torrington there is a large milk
 factory where most of the local milk  
 production is processed.              
       there are no factories in the   
 parish but one farm specialises in    
 mushroom production and others produce
 cheese,yoghurt and ice cream from     
 localmilk.
