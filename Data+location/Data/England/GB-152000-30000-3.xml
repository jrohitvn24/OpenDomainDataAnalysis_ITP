		<content>   GOLDSITHNEY LIES APROX. ONE MILE TO 
 THE EAST OF MARAZION. IT IS AN        
 EXPANDING COMMUNITY AND HAS BEEN      
 DESIGNATED AS A CONSERVATION AREA.    
   IT IS PURELY RESIDENTIAL AS THERE IS
 NO LOCAL INDUSTRY APART FROM          
 AGRICULTURE, MOST OF THE EMPLOYED     
 RESIDENTS COMMUTING TO PENZANCE.      
   THERE IS A HEALTHY COMMUNIAL SOCIAL 
 LIFE, MOSTLY CENTERED ON THE VILLAGE  
 HALLS WHERE THE YOUNG AND OLD ARE     
 CATERED FOR AS WELL AS THE MORE       
 ATHLETICALLY MINDED.                  
   THE CHRISTMAS TREE CLUB RAISES MONEY
 THROUGHOUT THE YEAR TO BE USED AT XMAS
 FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PEOPLE OF      
 GOLDSITHNEY.                          
   MOST OF THE HOUSING IS PRIVATE BUT  
 THERE ARE TWO SMALL COUNCIL ESTATES   
 AND A FEW OLD PEOPLES HOMES.          
                                       
                                       </content>
