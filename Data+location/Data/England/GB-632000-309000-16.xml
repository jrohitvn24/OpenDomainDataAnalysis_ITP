		<title>16PINE VIEW STABLES</title>
		<content>   These stables are in Blofield Heath 
 and have about 19 horses and ponies.  
 They also own a donkey.  Sometimes two
 of the mares have foals which are     
 reared at the stables.                
   Besides the stables there is a      
 school field where people can learn to
 ride and jump, but most people who can
 ride prefer to go for a hack (or ride)
 around the lanes in the area.  In the 
 autumn when the crops have been       
 harvested, you can also ride across   
 the stubble fields.                   
   During the week and at night the    
 horses are put into a large field,    
 where they can graze, though there is 
 a shelter for them and a supply of    
 water.                                
   Several young people  who like      
 horses and riding, help with the      
 schooling and with mucking out the    
 stables.                              </content>
