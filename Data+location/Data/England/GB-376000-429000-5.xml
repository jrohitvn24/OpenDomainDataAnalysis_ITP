		<title>05HOUSING IN ACCRINGTON</title>
		<content> Most of Accrington's houses are       
 terrace(terrace means houses in a row)
 Some houses are on their own,they are 
 called detached.Most houses have seven
 rooms,a living room,a dining room,a   
 kitchen,a bathroom and 3 bedrooms.    
 Around the Peel Park area most gardens
 are quite small if you live in a      
 terrace,but if you live in a          
 semi-detached or a quasi-detached they
 are fairly big.If you were to look    
 around the Peel Park area you would   
 find that most houses were made out of
 stone.This means that they are quite  
 old,most ofthe terraced houses were   
 built very early this                 
 century.Accrington is famous for{NORI 
 bricks which are very hard and a deep 
 red colour.{NORI}is{IRON}spelt        
 backwards.
