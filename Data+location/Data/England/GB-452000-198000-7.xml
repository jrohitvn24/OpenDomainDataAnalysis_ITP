		<title>07Arts and Crafts - Radley</title>
		<content>There are a few remaining crafts which 
provide people with a livelihood,      
but many villagers practise a variety  
of arts and crafts in their leisure    
time. Tucked away in a garden shed a   
man works to make violins and repair   
all sorts of stringed instruments.     
Elsewhere  others design and provide   
visual displays for exibitions.        
Photography also provides a living     
for one and pleasure for many          
others. Ladies learn flower arranging  
of fresh and artificial flowers.       
There are sewing groups making         
various items including knitting and   
crochetwork to send to the local       
hospital and abroad. Radley Women's    
Institute have worked two murals       
depicting the village and its          
activities and these are now displayed 
in the Church and Church Room. Members 
also cook for the local W.I. Market.   </content>
