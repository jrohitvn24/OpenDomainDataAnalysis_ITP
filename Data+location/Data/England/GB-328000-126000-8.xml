 partnership and they began the farm in
 1960.They have 44 acres,of which 9    
 acres are buildings,hedges and        
 conservation areas.They have roughly  
 50,000 trees.They grow apples,pears,  
 plums,gooseberries and damsons.       
  Their main crop is apples_26 acres of
 dessert apples and 4 acres of cooking 
 apples.The majority of the crop is    
 sent to Bristol Wholesale Market.They 
 go in 20lb cartons and 30lb wooden    
 boxes.Any rejects are sent to the     
 local cider company.A small percentage
 of the fruit is sold directly to local
 shops and through their own farm shop.
 In late July and early August they    
 sometimes have 'Pick Your Own'. This  
 is for everything except apples.      
  The two owners work full_time and    
 local women are employed part_time,   
 according to the season.              </content>
