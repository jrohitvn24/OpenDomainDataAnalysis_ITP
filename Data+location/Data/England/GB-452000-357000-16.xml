		<title>16RECREATION IN 1985.</title>
		<content> Recreation is an interesting subject  
 for the eighties because more people  
 have time to enjoy it.We found out    
 pupils hobbies in Berry Hill Middle . 
          The most popular in the First
 Year and Second Year was swimming.    
 The Third Years like bike riding as   
 their most popular hobby.The Fourth   
 Year's most popular hobby was sport.  
          The Coxmoor Golf Club is for 
 all ages to play golf.It has eighteen 
 holes and there is a shop next to it  
 which sells golf equipment.We found   
 out about Berry Hill Squash Club,it   
 has eight courts and it costs 30p per 
 game.
