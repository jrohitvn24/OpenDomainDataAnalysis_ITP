		<content>{Jennifer Steele writes}- About 60     
 children attend our School, 6 come by 
 taxi from Gatcombe or Billingham, 38  
 come by School Transport or car from  
 Rookley, the rest live in Chillerton. 
 The school has a main Hall and Servery
 with two small Classrooms. School     
 dinners are sent out from Newport. A  
 Mobile Classroom for the youngest     
 children stands in the playground.    
 School begins at 8.50 a.m. and pupils 
 work in three classes each with a two 
 year age span. In front of the school 
 is a blossomy garden and at the side  
 is a field for sports. We are taken to
 swim to the Medina Pool and we enjoy  
 the Music and Country Dance Festival. 
 A stage is put up in the Hall for our 
 Christmas Concert. A{Playgroup}for pre
 -school children is run by{my Mum}at  
 the recently renovated Wesleyan Chapel
 now used as a Community Centre.       </content>
