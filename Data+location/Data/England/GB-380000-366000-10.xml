		<content> Documentories were popular with the   
 30-45 year age group, wereas comedies 
 were prefered by the younger ages and 
 children. Music preference was very   
 varied and colourful, peoples tastes  
 ranged from pop, jazz, country and    
 western and opera but the most popular
 was classical music.                  
 The most popular newspapers were the  
 national papers delivered daily.The   
 most popular magazines delivered      
 monthly were SPORTING LIFE, HORSE AND 
 HOUND, FARMERS GUARDIAN.It is         
 interesting to see that the choice of 
 these magazines is perhaps determined 
 by the area and the farming           
 enviroment.                           
 The majority of households had two    
 cars which is the average figure for  
 todays lifestyle, although one farm   
 proved to be the exception by having  
 four!                                 </content>
