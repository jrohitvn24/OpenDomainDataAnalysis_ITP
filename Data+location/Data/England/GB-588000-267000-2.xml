buying their houses. This part of the  
village population is somewhat fluid   
as promotion or redundancy often means 
a change of residence. There is a good 
proportion of retired people also.There
are about half a dozen truly old       
village families left. To the N &amp; NE of
the village there are arable farms.    
People who live and work in the village
do so on the land, at the P.O. at the  
builders(3) and the garage. The village
is well within reach of other towns    
(eg Thetford,Stowmarket)               
The land is a thorough mixture of heavy
and light soil.                        
Great Barton is pleasantly rural, with 
easy access to several larger towns    
(eg Cambridge, Norwich) and one and a  
half hours by road to London on the    
M11.
