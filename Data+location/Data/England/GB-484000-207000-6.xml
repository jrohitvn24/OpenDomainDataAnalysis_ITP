 A Charter in 1400 granted Wendover a  
Thursday market and after an absence   
of many years it was re-introduced in  
May 1983 proving to be a popular       
addition to the village.               
 People scurrying to and fro across    
the Manor Waste. Traders selling their 
wares-                                 
 Fishmongers, Butchers.                
 Bargaining! Arguing!                  
 The place of a thousand cries,        
Mingling with the jolly music of a     
fiddler, cap on ground.                
 Dusk falls, and the last customers    
wander home.                           
The noise dies and stalls are          
dismantled as an evening mist creeps   
over the Chiltern Hills. A lone        
sparrow pecks at a crumb - all that is 
left on the ancient cobbles to show    
where the Thursday market has been!    </content>
