		<title>13WILDLIFE</title>
		<content> This is an intensively farmed and     
 densely populated area,and has been so
 for many centuries.As a result many of
 the larger forms of wildlife have     
 disappeared and many others are under 
 threat,from such  things as pesticides
 and population pressure.However the   
 Queen Elizabeth Country Park wardens  
 work hard to preserve the local       
 wildlife ,especially that associated  
 with the  chalk downlands.This        
 includes plants such as the cowslip,  
 insects like the yellow meadow ant,   
 butterflies such as the chalkhill blue
 ,reptiles including the adder and     
 various lizards and mammals like the  
 roe dear.It is of interest to note    
 that the hot summer of 1984 produced  
 an extraordinarily large number of    
 adders  and that the rabbit population
 is once again beginning to reach large
 numbers.                              </content>
