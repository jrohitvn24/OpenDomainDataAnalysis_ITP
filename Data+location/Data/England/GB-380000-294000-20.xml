		<title>20MAKING THE SURVEY</title>
		<content>   This survey was carried out by      
members of Lower Penn Women's Institute
in Staffordshire.   As the block under 
survey was some four kilometres from   
Lower Penn and the members involved had
only limited local knowledge it was    
necessary to make a number of          
expeditions by car to study the        
district and talk to people living     
there.   This proved to be a most      
interesting and enjoyable venture.
