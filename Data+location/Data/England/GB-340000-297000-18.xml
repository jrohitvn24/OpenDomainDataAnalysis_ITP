		<content>{"Bunch" Jones}is a lovely old lady who
 was{born in Lower Darnford}farm house 
 and lived there until she was twelve. 
 She came back to visit the farm so we 
 could talk to her about her life.We   
 wrote her a letter of thanks:-        
{Dear Mrs Jones,                       
                I hope you enjoyed your
 day on the farm .I wonder if you are  
 sad that the farm has changed over the
 years.Did you eat a lot of carrots    
 when you were young because your eyes 
 sparkle?I imagine you with long blonde
 hair,blue eyes and very pretty. I     
 would not get to sleep with all the   
 animals making noises.You were not    
 what I expected.I thought you would   
 need a walking stick and have loads of
 wrinkles but you didn't.              
                  Love from            
                    {Donna and Caroline
