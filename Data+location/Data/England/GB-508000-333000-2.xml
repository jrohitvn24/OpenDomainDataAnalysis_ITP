		<title>02HORBLING AND BILLINGBOROUGH</title>
		<content> The villages of Billingborough and    
 Horbling are fairly small.            
 Billingborough has a population of    
 approximately 850 and Horbling is     
 smaller. They are quiet except when   
 the R.A.F. flies low over them. They  
 are 10 to 15 miles from 4 towns where 
 people go to shop.                    
  There are a few factories employing  
 some people but most people commute to
 the towns to work . Not many of the   
 villagers work on the land. There is a
 primary  school in each village and a 
 secondary school in Billingborough .We
 have selection still in Lincolnshire  
 and the children who go to Grammar    
 Schools go to Sleaford. Billingborough
 has a Health Centre with 2 doctors and
 a nurse. Our nearest hospital is at   
 Grantham 14 miles away. There are     
 several shops in Billingborough but   
 most people shop in town.             </content>
