		<title>07My House in Blackmore End</title>
		<content>  I live at 5,Lime Avenue,Blackmore End
 The Avenue has lime trees down each   
 side.It is an unadopted cul-de-sac.   
 There are no litter bins,pavements or 
 letter boxes in our road,but we do    
 have 2 speed-bumps and a lamp-post.   
  The inhabitants of the 24 houses     
 range in age from babies to the       
 elderly.Nearly every family has a car.
  If you go up the bumpy farm track at 
 the end of the road you will see      
 fields and at the top of the track    
 there is an old farm with horses.     
  My house is about 50 years old.The   
 brick walls are 11 inches thick.It now
 has 5 bedrooms,several reception      
 rooms,3 bathrooms,2 kitchens and a    
 garage.This includes a self-contained 
 flat for my grandmother.The house has 
 a large back garden with various trees
 and a climbing frame and swing.
