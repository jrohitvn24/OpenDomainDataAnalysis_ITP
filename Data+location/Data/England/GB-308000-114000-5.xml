		<content> On MAIDENDOWN and BLACKDOWN COMMON,   
 in late Spring and eary Summer,  marsh
 and heath orchids are to be found and 
 the charming but elusive little pink  
 butterwort.  Later, the vivid         
 golden-orange bog asphodel and the    
 pretty pink and silvery cross-leaved  
 heath show up, while on THE BEACON    
 itself bell-heather and ling grow     
 freely - also dodder, blue and pink   
 milkwort and the round and long-leaved
 sundew.  Earlier, the rippling purple 
 moor grass is much in evidence with a 
 variety of ferns including the hard   
 fern, while the dwarf or summer gorse 
 is abundant later in the year.  From  
 January on, almost any part of the    
 the Parish will reveal, in due course,
 snowdrops, primroses, wood violets,   
 kingcups, early purple orchids, lady's
 smock, cow parsley and a host of      
 others.                               </content>
