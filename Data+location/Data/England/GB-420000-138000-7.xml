		<content> We asked some children in our block   
 what they did in thear spare time. The
{activities}they do include swimming   
 football dancing playing cards reading
 motorbiking making models and going to
{cubs}and{brownies.}All the children   
 that we asked had a T.V. and they     
 watched about 2_3 hours a day.They all
 went to the cinema but only about once
 a year.Most under 11's go to bed by   
 half past 8 and get up about 7a.m.    
 Everybody had a {big garden}with trees
 and most people had about 2 sheds and 
 a swing.Most people had firs and      
 blossom trees and bluebells,          
 daffodils, daisies, pansies and       
 dandelions.
