		<title>12VILLAGE BLACKSMITH</title>
		<content>    Mr John Wilson bought the          
 blacksmiths shop in 1957. It had been 
 a blacksmiths for many years.         
    It was a wooden building bricked   
 around by Mr. Wilson. When the        
 building was completed the wooden     
 building was knocked down.            
    When they first started farm       
 machinery repairs were the main jobs  
 for 8 to 9 workers. Gradually as      
 farmers got their own welding         
 equipment and trained farm employees  
 to weld this type of work has become  
 almost non existant.                  
    In recent years they have mostly   
 manufactured machinery for fruit      
 growers. Some machinery is for locals 
 and some for Kent growers. They also  
 distribute their machinery to farmers 
 in France,Belgium,Spain,Portugal      
 and Holland. The firm now employs 2   
 workers who are Mr Wilson's sons.     </content>
