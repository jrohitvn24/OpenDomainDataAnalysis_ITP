		<title>15CRIME IN CODICOTE/WELWYN</title>
		<content>  The area of Welwyn consists largely  
 of residential housing with a         
 commuting population, giving rise to  
 burglaries during the daytime and     
 often attracting criminals from the   
 Metropolitan area.                    
  Codicote being of a more rural nature
 attracts poachers to the area for     
 pheasants, deer and rabbits.          
  Like all areas, thefts from motor    
 vehicles are rife and the presence of 
 a beat bobby is of little deterrent in
 this aspect.                          
  Unlike large conurbations crime is of
 a spasmodic nature.                   
  There is a very small coloured popu_ 
 lation who fit in happily in the area.
  The Magistrates Court at Hatfield    
 serves the area, with more serious    
 crime being referred to the Crown     
 Court at St. Albans or in some cases  
 to Bedford.                           </content>
