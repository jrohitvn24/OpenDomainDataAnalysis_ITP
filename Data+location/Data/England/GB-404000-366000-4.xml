		<content>Hollinsclough School 1985              
Charlie Futcher Age 8                  
On Thursday, 20th June,1985 at 8-30 a.m
I came to school as usual.Some of the  
infants came rushing out yelling"We    
have been burgled!"                    
At first I did not belive it but when I
saw the office had been smashed I      
nearly fainted.The police arrived and  
we all watched the poiceman checking   
for finger prints.Soon a Joiner came   
and repaired the smashed door and      
window.They had taken a Sinclair       
Spectrum,Research Machine Moniter,     
an electric kettle and all the other   
eletric things,as well as quite a few  
bits and pieces.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
