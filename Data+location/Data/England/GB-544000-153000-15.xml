		<title>15SHOPS IN BRASTED</title>
		<content> There is now only one small shop in   
 Brasted for people to buy groceries.  
 Fifty years ago there were about ten  
 selling food.                         
 Nowadays most people have cars so that
 they can reach the nearby larger towns
 where the shops are larger and sell a 
 wide range of goods.These shops are   
 usually cheaper and stay open longer. 
 Years ago people seldom left the      
 village for anything.                 
 The local shops are now mostly        
 antiques.There are sixteen in Brasted 
 alone.The windows are full of old     
 furniture,china and brass,pictures and
 maps all brightly polished and        
 attractively displayed.This brings    
 many visitors to Brasted where they   
 have a wide choice in a small place.
