		<content> The dominent feature of Stansted      
 Mountfitchet is its{Windmill}which    
 overlooks the village.                
 In{1787}a{Millhouse,Malthouse}and     
{Villa}were built.Now the bakehouse and
 Villa have now been incorporated into 
 an adjacent private dwelling.The Mill-
 house is now a Catholic Church.The    
 Malthouse was destroyed by fire in    
 1877.                                 
 During 1910 the Mill ceased to        
 function and 30 years later severe    
 storms damaged much of the building.  
 In 1950 the Windmill was listed as an 
{Ancient Monument}and a{restoration    
{committee}was set up to undertake     
 major repairs.                        
 In May 1985 Stansted's Windmill stands
 pround,having received its new sails. 
 Stansted Mill remains one of the few  
 complete surviving examples of what   
 was once a familiar sight in Essex.   </content>
