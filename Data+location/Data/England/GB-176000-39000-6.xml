		<content> In Carnon Downs  there are three shops
 including a Post Office.    The others
 are Vivo, which sells mostly food, and
 Butlers,  which is a kind of  DIY shop
 which also sells shoes.               
 There  is also a  telephone exchange -
 Telecom -  next to Vivo.              
 There is a Bronze Age burial  mound in
 Parc-an-Creeg.                        
 There is a  caravan park  called Ring-
 well  which has  a big  swimming  pool
 open to the public.                   
 There  are  also  two  lots of  granny
 flats  and  by  them  are some council
 houses.                               
 The Garden Centre  includes a pet shop
 and cafe.                             
 The Playing Field has 3  swings plus a
 baby one and there is also a slide.   
 There are plans for a Carnon Downs By-
 Pass which will cut the village in two
 and is proving controversial.         </content>
