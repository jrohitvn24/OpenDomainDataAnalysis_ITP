		<title>16The Vets of Tregony</title>
		<content>   In Tregony there are two vets       
 who cover the area of six square km.  
 In a normal day he will start by going
 round to a local dairy farm and give  
 the farmer advice following the       
 outbreak of diseases like Foot and    
 Mouth, Bovine T.B., Laminitis,        
 Mastitis and Worms.                   
   He will then go back and hold a two 
 hour surgery, dealing mainly with     
 people's pets but he sometimes deals  
 with farm animals during the surgery  
 session.                              
   In the Winter and Spring he will    
 often have to go to a farm, three or  
 four times a night to deliver calves  
 and see that they are healthy.        
   The vets in this area deal mainly   
 with prophylactic medicine which aims 
 to prevent disease by vaccinating and 
 careful monitoring of animal welfare.
