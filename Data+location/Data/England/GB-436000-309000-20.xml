		<title>20Farming in Swepstone</title>
		<content> Swepstone no longer has so many       
 working farms as it had in the past.  
 There are only three small ones now.  
 Dishley Grange is a small dairy       
 farm and the farmer does contract     
 work, such as ploughing other farmers'
 fields.  Upper Fields Farm has 27     
 acres and rents ten.  Over the years, 
 it has decreased from a dairy and     
 mixed to an arable farm, and they have
 sold off most of their land so it is  
 now very small.  Church Farm has been 
 in the family for 16 years. It has 6  
 acres grassland and 5 acres with farm 
 building on.  It is a small, part-time
 holding.  The farm is worked by the   
 family. They have a tractor, nine     
 calves, six horses and five hundred   
 turkeys.  The farm has decreased in   
 size over the years.
