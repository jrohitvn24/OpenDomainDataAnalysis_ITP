		<title>18EMPLOYMENT in Thornbury</title>
		<content>    In our area of Thornbury we noticed
 that  an  old woollen mill on Randolph
 St.  had  been  taken  over  by a tyre
 company.  GEC in Leeds Old Rd only has
{450 people employed there }but{in 1968
{there were 5000 employees.            
    At  that  time  nearly  75%  of the
 parents worked  either at GEC (English
 Electric then!) or at Crofts,  another
 engineering firm, or at the mill.  Now
 there is{22% unemployment}in our area.
                                       
    In our survey of 20 families{4}dads
 were{unemployed,}only  2 mums had jobs
 outside the home  although 3 made soft
 toys at home.{Only 1 dad worked at the
{engineering works}and{1 at the mill.  
    The working dads did jobs such as:-
 ropemaker,  plumber,  policeman,   bus
 mechanic,  accountant,  garden fence -
 maker,  3  in  computing, and 1 making
 pencils and rubbers!                  </content>
