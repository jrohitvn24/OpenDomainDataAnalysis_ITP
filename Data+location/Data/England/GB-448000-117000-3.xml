		<title>03THE DAY OF A FAIR OAK CHILD</title>
		<content>    Every Sunday I wake up at seven 'o 
 clock in the morning and then I get up
 and have a wash. After  that I get    
 into some old clothes so that if I get
 muddy while I am fishing it will not  
 matter.                               
    After I have got dressed, I go down
 and have my breakfast. I get my       
 fishing gear up together and when     
 everything is in order I set out for  
 my friend Wally's house.              
    When I get to Wally's house I call 
 for him and we go to Mrs.Barnard's    
 lake and set up our rods and start to 
 fish .                                
    We stay there all day and leave at 
 six o'clock. When I get home I have my
 tea and after that I watch television.
 I go to bed at about half past ten.   
    I like to go fishing because there 
 is not much else to do in Fair Oak on 
 a Sunday.                             </content>
