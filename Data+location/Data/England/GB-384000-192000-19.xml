		<title>19Hookshouse Pottery.</title>
		<content> The only retail outlet in the tiny    
 hamlet of Hookshouse is a pottery     
 which is housed in a row of low       
 buildings next to a cottage.The potter
 lives in the cottage.He has his own   
 kiln at the pottery and even makes his
 own wood-ash glaze.Most of his        
 products are well-designed and        
 attractively produced items of        
 table-ware.These can be viewed and/or 
 bought from the gallery/shop which    
 adjoins the pottery.This building     
 itself is of some interest.It was     
 originally built for raising game     
 birds for the local landowner.The     
 niches which were used for this       
 purpose now make an attractive display
 area for the stone-ware mugs and jugs.
