  We looked at the hobbies and pastimes
that take place in children's homes,   
and discovered an enormous variety of  
things taking place.                   
  Many children collected things, vary-
ing from cards and pictures to stick in
albums, to stamps, toy dolls, fluffy   
animal toys, models from films like the
'Star Wars' series, postage stamps,    
comics, records or tapes and rubbers.  
  The latest crazes are collecting My  
Little Pony dolls for girls, and the   
boys like toy robots that change into  
cars, lorries and dinosaurs.           
  Other pastimes involved the parents  
and include piano playing, sewing,     
drawing and painting, ballet and tap   
dancing, chess, snooker, horse riding  
and DIY. Of course, TV and radio and   
listening to music still provide enter-
tainment as does reading books, etc.   </content>
