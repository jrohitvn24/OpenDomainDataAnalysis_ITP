		<title>03Mr. Takle's Farm</title>
		<content>     Mr Takle's Farm is called         
 Treborough Farm.   It is high up on   
 the Brendon Hills.   Mr. Takle took us
 around his farm in a tractor and      
 trailer.   It was good fun!           
     We took a photograph of Mr and Mrs
 Takle with the group that visitied    
 the farm.                             
      Mr. Takle believes the farm to   
 date like the Church at Treborough    
 from the 14th Century.   The farm     
 buildings have been built from slate  
 from the nearby Slate Quarry.         
      This Quarry is no longer worked  
 but it is now used as Municipal Refuse
 tip serving the whole of West         
 Somerset.
