		<title>11A DAY AT HOLLY TREE FARM</title>
		<content> At 10.00 we arrived at Holly Tree     
 Farm. We asked the farmer lots of     
 questions and he was very patient with
 us. He told us that the farm is slowly
 being taken away by the housing       
 estate. If the Council damage any of  
 the crops in their developments then  
 they have to pay for them. He rents   
 his fields for 363 days a year so the 
 Council can't take the fields away    
 except for the two days!!             
 After we had finished asking questions
 we were shown the farm animals(horses,
 goats and dogs). Then the farmer took 
 us to his father's nearby farm where  
 we saw cattle, cows, hens and ducks.  
 Before we went back to school we just 
 had time to look at the milking       
 parlour. We all enjoyed our day very  
 much.
