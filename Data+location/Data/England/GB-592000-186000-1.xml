		<content> OUR AREA LIES IN THE S.E. CORNER OF   
 THE COUNTY OF ESSEX. IT IS BORDERED ON
 THE SOUTH BY THE RIVER THAMES AND ON  
 THE EAST BY THE NORTH SEA.   TO THE   
 NORTH LIE THE CREEKS AND MARSHES OF   
 THE RIVER ROACH.   IN THE CENTRE OF   
 OUR AREA IS THE VILLAGE OF GREAT      
 WAKERING WITH A POPULATION OF         
 APPROXIMATELY 5000 BUT IT ALSO        
 INCLUDES PARTS OF SHOEBURYNESS AND    
 LITTLE WAKERING.  THE LANDSCAPE IS    
 GENERALLY FLAT AND TREELESS WITH MOST 
 OF THE OPEN SPACES USED FOR           
 AGRICULTURAL PURPOSES APART FROM THE  
 AREAS OF MARSHLAND.   THE HOUSING     
 VARIES FROM LARGE DETACHED HOUSES     
 STANDING IN THEIR OWN GROUNDS TO SMALL
 TERRACED COTTAGES.   THE ROADS ARE ALL
 SINGLE CARRIAGEWAY LEADING TO AND FROM
 THE TOWN OF SOUHTEND-ON-SEA WHICH IS  
 THE NEAREST LARGE TOWN.
