		<title>12FARMING HISTORY</title>
		<content>  Mechi Farm was originally called     
 Blennerhasset Farm. In 1864 the second
 son of Sir Wilfred Lawson visited a   
 model farm in Essex run by Alderman   
 Mechi. He was very impressed by the   
 methods in use there. His father      
 bought him Blennerhasset Farm. He     
 changed its name to Mechi and         
 transformed it into a model farm.     
  He experimented with steam tractors, 
 built a laboratory, and produced      
 liquid manures and fertilizers. He    
 even had his own gas works, providing 
 street lighting for the village.      
  When visiting the farm today it is   
 possible to see the remains of the gas
 works. In the village there is an old 
 gas-lamp post outside the school.     
  Mr. Lawson also provided the village 
 with a shop and a reading room.
