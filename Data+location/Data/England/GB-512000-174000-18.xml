		<title>18CHANGING TIMES IN HOUNSLOW.</title>
		<content> In{1914}the shops in Hounslow were    
 different.There were many small{family
{shops,}a printing office and many     
 public houses.Platts Stores,a grocers 
 was one of the biggest.There weren't  
 any {supermarkets.}We talked to an old
 lady called Mrs. Joan Willise.Her     
 favourite shop was Bon Marche, a      
 ladies underwear shop.Now there are no
 family shops left.Most shops belong to
 big groups and have names that can be 
 seen in all High Streets e.g.Boots,   
 W.H.Smith,Marks and Spencer,Woolworth.
{Clothes}today are more comfortable and
 practical.{1914 }workmen wore three   
 piece suits and women wore hobble     
 skirts and blouses.Unlike today men   
 and women always wore hats.Life was   
 much simpler but there was a greater  
 difference between rich and poor.Today
{ordinary}people are{wealthier}and have
 expensive appliances in their homes.  </content>
