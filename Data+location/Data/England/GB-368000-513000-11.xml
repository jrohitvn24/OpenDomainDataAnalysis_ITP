 This area of old Westmorland is       
 steeped in tales of the               
 supernatural,but the only             
 authenticated haunting was in Asby    
 Vicarage. A presence was often felt,  
 and a rather shepeless form, thought  
 to be female, had been seen on several
 occasions. This was rather disturbing 
 to the residents and felt to be       
 malign, so an exorcism was held about 
 a decade ago and nothing has been     
 seen, felt or heard since.            
      The country-wide "black dog"     
 legend appears in this area as being  
 headless and silent, a portent of the 
 seer's  death.                        
      Superstition is very strong among
 the older residents, especially where 
 their animals are concerned.
