		<content> In many ways we are very self-        
 reliant in this area, we have to be,  
 as there is only one delivery of      
 post per day and two collections on   
 weekdays but mainly because we no     
 longer have a Post Office. Early in   
 1984 the facility whereby on Thursday 
 mornings for three hours a local lady 
 would operate a mobile Post office in 
 the village hall, primarily for the   
 elderly to collect their pensions, was
 withdrawn despite strenuous protest - 
 it was regarded as "uneconomic". This 
 has therefore caused a major problem  
 for some people who do not have cars  
 of their own and cannot easily get to 
 nearby towns. They are often reliant  
 on generous neighbours to give them   
 lifts since the bus service also      
 operates on a very limited basis.There
"is still a telephone kiosk in the High
 Street but it may be under threat!    </content>
