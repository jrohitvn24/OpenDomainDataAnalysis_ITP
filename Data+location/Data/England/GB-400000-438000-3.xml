		<title>03MAN AND THE LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content>     Inevitably man has had a great    
 influence on the landscape of Keighley
 and district.Much of the land outside 
 of the built up area is used for      
{intensive grassland}farming with some{
{rough grazing.}Cattle and sheep are   
 grazed whilst some grass is cut and   
 stored as{silage,}which is used to    
 feed cattle during the winter.        
     There are several{quarries}around 
 Keighley from which large quantities  
 of building stone have been extracted.
 Some of these have been abandoned     
 leaving large{scars on the hillsides. 
     The town of Keighley has changed  
 constantly with much land being used  
 for the building of large{supermarkets
 with{ car parks,}a{pedestrianised     
{shopping centre,housing estates}and{  
{industrial estates.}There has also    
 been a build up of housing in the     
 suburban areas and villages.          </content>
