		<title>05Wormleighton The Residents</title>
		<content> The estate cottages built for farm    
 workers are chiefly occupied by people
 who work elsewhere. Only two farm     
 workers remain. It is almost essential
 to own a car since the only daily     
 deliveries are post, bread and milk.  
 The bus service runs twice on a       
 Thursday into Banbury. Activities in  
 the village consist of a monthly whist
 drive, residents must travel for other
 leisure activities. It is no longer a 
 closely knit community and even in    
 such a small village it is possible   
 not to know other residents. The      
 church life is almost non-existent and
 it can be lonely living here. The     
 Manor House is ageing and the Tudor   
 battlements shed their stones when the
 low flying air force planes whiz      
 overhead with a deafening roar.       
                                       
                                       </content>
