		<title>14THE ARUN GAP BEYOND S. STOKE</title>
		<content> North of South Stoke farming is       
 influenced by the new course of the   
 river Arun and its old meander across 
 the valley. The resulting wet-lands   
 caused by the new and the old river   
 beds provide good grazing for cattle. 
 This pasture is rented out for sheep  
 to crop in winter, from elsewhere. The
 meander forms a wide circular swamp,  
 dense with willow and undergrowth.    
 Within its circle is grassland and    
 deciduous trees and copses are        
 numerous.  the land rises abruptly    
 from this basin to a higher level     
 along which runs a farmers track      
 from North Stoke to the downs. Here   
 arable replaces pasture. Looking back 
 down the valley all seems in          
 miniature. South Stoke, the railway,  
 the river, the cattle - remote and    
 peaceful, but motorists heading for   
 the Downs dispel any quiet stillness. </content>
