		<title>07 AYNHO CHURCH</title>
		<content>   The church of St. Michael, Aynho,   
has a 14th. century {TOWER} which      
contains 8 bells, the earliest dated   
1603. A carrilon plays tunes on the    
bells evry 3 hrs. during the day.      
   The {NAVE} was rebuilt in 1723 in   
the classical style. There are 4       
blocks of box pews, one of which       
incorporates the choir pews. At the    
west end there is a  gallery. The      
chancel is very short and there are no 
pillars. There are many monuments to   
the Cartwright family and an organ.    
   {CHURCH ACTIVITIES} are many. There 
is a choir, a team of bellringers who  
ring the bells, 2 Bible study groups   
and an overseas missionary group. The  
Parochial Church Council is responsible
for running the church which is in     
Peterborough Diocese.                  
   The {RECTOR}, who lives in Aynho, is
also responsible for St.James,Newbottle</content>
