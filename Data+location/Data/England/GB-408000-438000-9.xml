		<content> Although Harden is a small village    
 surrounded by farmland, moors and     
 parks, we have important manufacturing
 industries here. Ellisons Circlips is 
 known worldwide for its making of     
 metal clips for joining parts and     
 pipes together. A few years ago they  
 won a Queen's award for industry for  
 their work.                           
 Jonas Woodhead's make springs for many
 kinds of things. They use different   
 kinds of machines to produce springs  
 of small size and enormous ones for   
 railway engines.                      
 The Castlefield Industrial Estate has 
 a large number of different           
 businesses. Primeur import goods from 
 all over the world to sell to         
 catalogue companies.
