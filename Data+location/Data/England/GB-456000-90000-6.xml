		<content>   At{Appley in Ryde}some men are      
 putting some new pipes to take all our
 sewage{water}and dirty water further  
 out to sea.All our sewage water only  
 used to go out as far as the pier or  
 not even as far as that.              
  {Southern Water}are laying{huge pipes
{and the pipes will}take all our{dirty 
{water two and a half miles out to sea.
{The whole}operation will cost         
 Â£6,000,000 and it will be finished in 
 1987 which is two whole years and I   
 will be 11 years old.                 
   The pipes are very big.I once went  
 to see a{Sewage Farm.}Southern Water  
 are doing the project so that our sea 
 will be{cleaner}and {healthier}and    
 that tourists will come over to the   
 Island and think what a nice place it 
 is on{The Isle of Wight. }
