		<content> The best day in my life was being a   
 bridesmaid .A bridesmaid's job is to  
 keep by the bride when needed for     
 things like holding her flowers.After 
 breakfast my hair was put up at the   
 hairdresser's salon before rushing    
 home to put on my bridesmaids dress.It
 was long, peach coloured, with a      
 floral pattern. The flowers were late,
 arriving just before we drove to      
 church in the old fashioned Rolls     
 Royce car. I carried a basket of white
 carnations. On my head, I wore a half 
 band of tiny peach flowers.The bride's
 long dress was a Victorian style white
 lace with a short veil.She tripped    
 over her dress hem in the half hour   
 service making us laugh.              
 The reception was held at  a hotel.   
 After a three course meal we had a    
 glass of champagne and drank a toast.
