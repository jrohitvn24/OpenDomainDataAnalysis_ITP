		<content> The village has no resident doctor.   
 Our nearest surgery is in Burnham     
 Market, four miles away; whose doctors
 visit the surrounding area on a rota  
 basis, three days a week.  Renewal    
 prescriptions are left at the Post    
 Office, for collection and delivery of
 medicines by the visiting doctors.    
 There are appointments and queueing   
 systems at the Surgery, as well as    
 baby, post and ante-natal clinics.  No
 transport is available, except cars.  
 An ambulance bus collects those       
 needing treatment in the nearest      
 hospitals at Kings Lynn, or Norwich.  
 There is a local hospital car service,
 run by volunteers.                    
 The nearest dentists are in Fakenham, 
 six miles away; where there is also a 
 DHSS chiropodist.  A mobile           
 chiropodist visits S Creake, every two
 months.                               </content>
