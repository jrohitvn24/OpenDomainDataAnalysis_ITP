 WITHERIDGE IS WELL SERVED BY THE      
 HEALTH SERVICE. JUST OFF THE SQUARE IS
 A DOCTORS SURGERY WHICH WAS BUILT     
 ABOUT SEVEN YEARS AGO. THREE DOCTORS  
 SHARE THE PRACTICE WHICH HAS SURGERIES
 IN TWO OTHER VILLAGES. THEY COVER A   
 RADIUS OF ABOUT FIFTEEN MILES WHICH   
 INCLUDES A LARGE RURAL AREA TOGETHER  
 WITH FOUR VILLAGES AND A NUMBER OF    
 SMALL HAMLETS. WINTER TRAVEL IS A     
 PROBLEMAND ONE YEAR PATIENTS HAD TO BE
 TAKEN TO HOSPITAL BY HELICOPTER. THE  
 SURGERY HAS VISITING SPECIALISTS  AND 
 RUN A BABY CLINIC. THE NEAREST        
 HOSPITALS ARE AT TIVERTON, BARNSTAPLE 
 AND EXETER.                           
 THE BIGGEST PROBLEM FOR THE DOCTORS IS
 THE LARGE NUMBER OF ELDERLY PEOPLE, A 
 VERY HIGH PROPORTION FOR SUCH A SMALL 
 VILLAGE.                              
                                       </content>
