		<title>07A HORNSEA CHILD IN 1940</title>
		<content> Forty years ago Hornsea only had{two  
{thousand people.}The new{school}was in
 Newbegin and had a large{playing field
 where they played{games}and did{roller
{skating}on the playground. Children   
 went{home}for their{lunch}and didn't  
 wear uniform. If the children were    
{naughty}at school, a slipper or a     
 ruler was used and the Headmaster kept
{a punishment book.                    
 On{Sundays}the children wore their    
{Sunday clothes}and went to{Sunday     
{School.}Afterwards they went for{a    
{walk}to the Mere or the Beach.        
 Sometimes they were given{2d each}and 
{bought}some{lucky bags}from the shop  
 and found sweets and whistles in them.
 In the{winter}when the{Mere}was{frozen
 they often{skated.}There was a{cinema 
 in Hornsea and one of the{favourite   
 films was{Snow White.
