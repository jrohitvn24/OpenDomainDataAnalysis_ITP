		<content> Our area is residential,but there are 
 three main roads.                     
{The A456 Halesowen by-pass}stretches  
 1.5 miles between the Bromsgrove and  
 Hayley Green islands.In 1962 a second 
 lane was added to the carriageway.It's
 an urban clearway and is part of the  
 Birmingham link to the Clent Hills and
 Kidderminster.                        
{The B4183 Hagley Road}streches through
 Halesowen into Hasbury.Passenger buses
 take people to places like            
 Stourbridge, Cradley Heath and Dudley.
 During the day 1000 vehicles pass per 
 hour down the Hagley road.            
{There are far more cars than other    
{vehicles on the by-pass.}The main road
 is busy and dangerous,but side roads  
 are fairly quiet and safe.Fortunately 
 there are not many main roads in this 
 area.
