 The area of our grid comprises a      
 landscape of fields with gentle hills 
 and small areas of woodland in the lea
 of Wenlock Edge.  It is an area of    
 pleasant green fields mostly put to   
 arable farming and grassland.  There  
 are areas of pine trees with small    
 coppices of natural deciduous trees.  
 Private woodlands are used for tree   
 cutting and shooting.                 
   Large fields have hedges dividing   
 them and hedges are found all along   
 the roadside.  This is a rural        
 landscape with only one fertiliser    
 distributing concern.                 
   Houses are scattered with only three
 centres of housing at Harley, Kenley  
 and Woodside cottages.  There are two 
 Garden Centres providing additional   
 employment and completing the rural   
 scene.                                </content>
