		<title>06A day in the life of Angela.</title>
		<content>   I get up at 7.00, get dressed, make 
 my bed and go downstairs. My breakfast
 is a cup of tea and some cornflakes.  
 After breakfast I put my shoes on and 
 go with my brother and father to take 
 my mum to work. After that I make my  
 dad some coffee and I then get ready  
 for school. At 8.30 I begin to walk   
 down to Lancaster Lane C.P. School    
 which opens at 9.00. We have assembly 
 first and then maths till playtime at 
 10.45. At playtime we often play      
 skipping. We go in at 11.00 and start 
 again by learning a spelling rule for 
 a test on Thursday. At 11.30 we have  
 reading until dinner time which is    
 from 12.00 until 1.15. In the         
 afternoon we do comprehension till    
 playtime at 2.15, then from 2.30 we do
 geography until hometime at 3.15. When
 I get home I change to go and play    
 with my friend Emma.                  </content>
