		<title>15JUDY WOODS, WYKE</title>
		<content>   Judy Woods is the largest area of   
 woodland in our block, comprising     
 mainly of mature oak and beech with a 
 scattering of sycamore, hazel, birch  
 and hawthorn.  During spring, large   
 areas of the woodland floor are       
 carpeted with bluebells and small     
 patches of wood sorrel and anenomes.  
   The woodland is looked after by     
 Bradford Met. Council and access to   
 the general public is unrestricted.   
 As a result, the area is criss-crossed
 by many paths which extend into the   
 surrounding farmland.  The scattered  
 copses and isolated mature trees make 
 the area picturesque and provide a    
 rich habitat for bird life. Blue tits,
 sparrows, magpies, rooks, blackbirds  
 and thrushes are common with owls and 
 woodpeckers more frequently heard and 
 a growing number of kestrels being    
 seen.                                 </content>
