		<content> HOUSING IN THIS VILLAGE IS MOSTLY     
 OWNER OCCUPIED WITH A PREPONDERANCE OF
 PERIOD AND EXPENSIVE PROPERTIES.      
 A FAIRLY SMALL PLOT OF LAND IN THE    
 REGION OF 0.2 ACRE MAY BE EXPECTED TO 
 REALISE AROUND Â£13,000 WHILST THE     
 AVERAGE PRICE IN A POORER AREA COULD  
 BE AROUND Â£10,000 FOR A SIMILAR PLOT. 
 THIS SIZE OF PLOT WOULD ONLY ACQUIRE  
 PLANNING PERMISSION FOR A SINGLE      
 DWELLING IN A VILLAGE LIKE PITSFORD   
 WHERE THE HOUSING DENSITY IS FAIRLY   
 LOW AND CONTROLLED. IN AN URBAN AREA  
 THE DENSITY MAY WELL BE HIGHER SO THAT
 MORE THAN ONE DWELLING MAY BE ERECTED 
 ON THIS SIZE OF PLOT.                 
 MANY HOUSES IN PITSFORD SELL FOR      
 Â£80,000 OR MORE AND THERE ARE FEW     
 AVAILABLE IN THE AVERAGE Â£30,000      
 CATEGORY.                             
 THERE ARE SOME COUNCIL OWNED HOUSES   
 AVAILABLE AS RENTED ACCOMMODATION.    </content>
