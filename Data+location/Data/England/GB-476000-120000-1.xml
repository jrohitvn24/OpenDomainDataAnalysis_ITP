		<content> Land - The salient feature to the     
 south of this area in Torberry Hill - 
 pronounced locally as Tarberry. Most  
 of the country is intensively farmed. 
 Mainly arable, with each farm running 
 a moderate size dairy herd and store  
 lambs. There is also a grass drying   
 plant for animal feed on the south    
 west boundary. West Heath common, on  
 the northern bounary, is  being worked
 as a sandpit. The low lying woods,    
 enclosing a small pond, on the north  
 eastern boundary of the area are being
 developed as a 'wet land'.            
 People - the area is sparcely         
 populated, half the residents being   
 invovled in farming. Because of       
 mechanization many of the farm        
 cottages have been converted and sold 
 to retired professional people.
