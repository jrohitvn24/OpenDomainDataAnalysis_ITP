		<title>11Kennet and Avon Canal</title>
		<content> the canal and a long existant stream  
 which fed Oakhill Mill. There are some
 very healthy{water cress beds}here    
 which are fed by the stream. We tasted
 the water cress and it was bitter, but
 Mrs. Wheatley said that it had to be  
 properly washed as little snails stick
 to it.                                
     Further along the road is         
{Froxfield Bridge.}This  is the{county 
{boundary}between{Wiltshire and        
{Berkshire.}We did some rubbings of the
 boundary signs. The Berkshire sign    
 just gave the name, but the Wiltshire 
 sign had a crest on it.               
     The canal continues South with a  
 lock. It is the{Froxfield Lower Lock, 
 (lock no. 70) and is one of three     
 locks known as the Froxfield Flight.  
 However only one of these locks is in 
 our section.The canal passes through  
 fields called{The Barrack Fields.     </content>
