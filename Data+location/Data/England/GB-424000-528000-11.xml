		<title>11MENDIP WALK (PART 1)</title>
		<content> I live on an estate at Coundon called 
 "Tottenham Estate." I live in the east
 of Coundon. The street  is called     
 Mendip Walk. There are only twelve    
 houses in our street and I live in    
 number twelve. Numbers 1, 2, 3, 10, 11
 and 12 are in a square with a little  
 grass in the middle. The other houses 
 go in a straight row. No traffic can  
 go up our street. Numbers 1,2,3,10, 11
 and 12 have garages and two bedrooms. 
 The other houses have no garage and   
 they are three bedroomed houses. We   
 have a recreation ground quite near.  
 14 children live in our street,but    
 there are no old people. The houses   
 have been built 17 years. When it     
 rains the grass goes all marshy. We   
 have a bank at the bottom of the      
 square and I like to skate there. Our 
 front room is massive and people think
 we have knocked a wall out.           </content>
