		<content>             Our school is called      
 Carleton Green County Primary School. 
 It has 264 pupils. It is a junior and 
 infant school and it has been open ten
 years. There are 7 classes in the     
 school and 13 staff. We have one      
 caretaker and he is very friendly. The
 reception infants start school at 2   
 different times of the year, the older
 ones in September and the slightly    
 younger ones in January. The time we  
 start school is 9:00am and we finish  
 at 3:30pm. The infants have 2         
 playtimes, a 15 minute morning and    
 afternoon playtime and a 1 hour 45    
 minute dinner break .The juniors have 
 no afternoon playtime.
