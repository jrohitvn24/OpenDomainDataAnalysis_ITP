		<title>06Ghosts in West Ashby.</title>
		<content> The Grove was originally the home of  
 the Elmhirst's. The family motto,     
 above the door, is Domino Confido -   
 Trust in the Lord.Several ghosts have 
 been discovered at the Grove, now an  
 hotel. One ghost on the top floor is  
 said to be friendly and give a warm   
 feeling.One ghost in a first floor    
 bathroom left a lady paralysed with   
 fear.One ghost opens and closes doors 
 in the utility room and first floor   
 shower room.This last ghost,named     
 Nellie,is described as being in her   
 20's, wearing a long black dress,white
 bib and apron and is perhaps a 19th   
 century maid.She moves things around  
 in the kitchen.Some claim to have seen
 a tall thin man in the Dining Room in 
 a grey double breasted suit.He is     
 thought to be Squire Elmhirst himself.
