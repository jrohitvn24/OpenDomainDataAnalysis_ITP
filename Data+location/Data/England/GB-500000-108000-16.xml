		<title>16SOUTH DOWNS EAST OF N. STOKE</title>
		<content> Two kilometres east of North Stoke,   
 facing south, lies a stretch  of land 
 apparently wholly arable. A wide      
 horse-shoe of tree tops visible in the
 distance, is in fact the tip of a tree
 clad hanger dropping abruptly from    
 sight and concealing at its foot a    
 swampy area of marsh and sedge. This  
 marsh is edged on its western side by 
 the old Arun meander with its river   
 bed dense with willows and water-     
 loving undergrowth, curving away to   
 rejoin the Arun at South Stoke. As the
 hanger runs south its height decreases
 giving way to a strip of deciduous    
 woodland cutting across the farmland. 
 Within one kilometre square the dry   
 chalk South Downs with arable crops   
 give way by this dramatic drop in     
 height to the uncultivated marsh below
 the hanger and, within the meander,   
 grassland reclaimed by drainage dykes.</content>
