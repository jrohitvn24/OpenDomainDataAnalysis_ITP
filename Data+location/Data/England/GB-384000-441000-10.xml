		<title>10BLACKO METHODIST CHAPEL</title>
		<content> In{1836}a barn at{BLACKO}was used for 
 services, it was also used as a       
 Sunday School. In{1849}the chapel was 
 campaigned for by a group of men who  
 had been expelled from the{WESLEYAN   
{CONFERENCE.}The chapel was finally    
 built on land bought in{1868}and is a 
 member of the{INDEPENDENT METHODIST   
{CONNEXION}which has an evangelical    
 approach and an unpaid ministry.      
 Relations with the village have always
 been mutually supportive and when the 
 roof fell in about thirty years ago,  
 the villagers helped with money and   
 with some of the rebuilding. Weekly   
 Congregations are now in the low      
 twenties although many villagers      
 attend social functions. The Chapel   
 Sunday School provides a home for the{
{YOUTH CLUB,}Whist Drives, a Mother and
 Baby Group and other meetings.
