 main Road near the centre of the      
 village. The lightest caravan was one 
 hundred weight and the heaviest was   
 just over hundred tons. The people who
 owned the caravan centre were called  
 Mr and Mrs Birkly they sell 150 new   
 caravans a year and 200 used caravans 
 a year. The land that the caravans are
 on occupies 2 acres. They have had    
 9 caravans                            
 stolen in the last  9 years.Before the
 Caravan Centre was on its' present    
 site there was a petrol station on the
 site once.The caravan centre had been 
 there for 9 years.They sold           
 accessories  but they are stopping it 
 because a lot of it was stolen. There 
 are 6 people employed at the Centre   
 and of these two work in the workshop.
