		<content>  Before we came there was a factory   
 which was started by the Mason        
 brothers in 1886. They employed 1500  
 people. They made tins and shoe       
 polish. It was knocked down in the    
 1970s and then Staveley Gardens was   
 built. The people who live there are  
 young families. Most of them have got 
 cars but we haven't, so it is hard for
 my mum to get the shopping home. The  
 people who live in "The Old Gran's"   
 are mostly pensioners of the company. 
 Our house has got two bedroom and one 
 bathroom. It's got a front and a back 
 garden. The people are very nice in   
 Staveley . My mum pops in and out of  
 our next-door neighbour's. I'm never  
 on my own round Staveley. We do not   
 use the new community centre, we are  
 going to join but not just yet.
