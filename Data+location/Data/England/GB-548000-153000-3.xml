		<content> My name is Kate Surry. I live in      
Gordon Road. On a Sunday my brother and
I get up at 07.30. Then at 0800 my Mum 
and Dad get up as well. We all get     
washed and go down to breakfast. For   
breakfast we have toast, tea and       
cereal. After breakfast I go and clean 
my teeth. Then at 10.05 my brother and 
I go to Sunday School. That finishes   
at 11.30. When I get back from Sunday  
School I change into my jeans and go   
and call for my friend Caroline. I     
play with her until 1300 which is when 
I go home for lunch. We finish our     
lunch at about 13.30. Then at 1400 we  
go to Nana and Grandad's house. They   
live in Essex. Our cousins are         
sometimes there. They are my Dad's     
parents. We return home at out 2100.   
When I get home I have a bath and      
clean my teeth and go to bed.
