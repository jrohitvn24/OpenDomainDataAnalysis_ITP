		<content> The area around Daresbury is basically
 a rural area. There is arable and     
 pature land. Commonside Farm is a     
 typical dairy farm and all the crops  
 that they grow are grown to provide   
 food for all the 160 dairy cattle.    
 They sell their cattle at he          
 nearest market at Beeston. Popular    
 farm is a Fruit Farm growing soft     
 fruit and selling them on a           
 'Pick-your-own' basis. They also raise
 and sell turkeys for the Christmas    
 market.                               
 The laboratory takes up very small    
 space but provides the most jobs in   
 the area, about 500 in total.         
 There is little new building apart    
 from the area desgnated as new town   
 allowing the older parts to remain    
 reletively unspoiled.
