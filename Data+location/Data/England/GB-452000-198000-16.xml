		<content>At the end of each term our school     
holds a concert in the hall, and in    
the summer there is also an Open Day.  
There are class songs,- at Christmas a 
Nativity play by the infants,- and     
some children play solos on their      
own instruments and recorder groups    
play at the concerts. The parents and  
relatives come to watch free of charge.
At Easter and Harvest-tide the Vicar   
comes and takes a small service. At the
end of each school year a disco is held
for the fourth years who will be       
leaving, but all the classes are       
welcome to come. Each class in the     
summer term goes on a trip to an       
interesting place. Each year the top   
class goes for four nights at the      
County's Nature Reserve, Hill End, at  
Farmoor. We stay in a dormitory and    
work in the sixty five acres there. In 
1985 Radley school has 105 children.   </content>
