 Railway Trust Ltd. came to talk to our
 school,and told us about the          
 preservation of the railway.The Trust 
 began in 1960 with the aim of buying  
 and preserving Leeds built            
 locomotives.In 1985 the Railway has 9 
 steam locomotives(Pecket 1 and 11,    
 Matthew Murray, Windle, Danish, Henry 
 de Lacey, Hawthorne and N.E.R.) and 6 
 diesel locomotives.The rolling stock  
 includes cranes, goods and coal wagons
 and brake vans.                       
  Train services for visitors run on   
 Saturdays, Sundays and Bank Holidays, 
 and on some special occasions such as 
 school steam days. The present cost is
 60 pence return(adults) and 40 pence  
 (children) and you can ride from the

 can visit the park. All work on the   
 railway is done by volunteers.        </content>
