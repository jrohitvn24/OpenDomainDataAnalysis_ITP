		<title>10Horses and Riding.</title>
		<content> Without doubt this is a horsey area,  
 not only because the land is poor for 
 intensive agriculture and bridleways  
 are numerous, but because there is    
 good riding country almost surrounding
 the area.Many units of 1 or 2 paddocks
 for a few horses have been bought as  
 such ,or are leased, and it is common 
 to see jumps set up.There are 2 livery
 stables each accomodating 15 horses   
 and several for fewer horses, also a  
 small but well known Arab stud farm.  
  One sees a complete diversity of     
 horses and all seem very well looked  
 after. Many ride with the Wey Valley  
 Riding Club and hunt with either of 2 
 packs coming into this area twice a   
 season. Cross Country is the most     
 usual event. For the many young riders
 there are Pony Clubs, occasionally    
 joining for Pony Rallies which include
 jumping and riding lessons.           </content>
