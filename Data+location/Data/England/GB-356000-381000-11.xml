		<content> This canal runs from Worsley near     
 Manchester to connect with the        
 Potteries. We spent 3 hours by the    
 canal and only saw 5 pleasure boats.  
 Ther were plenty of signs of wildlife 
 and a lot of fishermen. The canal     
 towpath is also well used by people   
 exercising. There were more walkers   
 than cruisers. The main London-       
 Scotland railway runs North-South     
 here, at peak periods one train will  
 pass every 7 minutes. The level       
 crossing and its signal box have been 
 abandoned, it means quite a long      
 detour to cross the lines by car.     
 There is a large marina close to the  
 intersection of the motorway, railway 
 and canal. A housing development      
 overlooks the canal, properties       
 starting at about Â£21,000 for a       
 typical property with 3 bedrooms,     
 kitchen,lounge and balcony.           </content>
