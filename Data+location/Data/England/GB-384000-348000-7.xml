		<content>   In Tunstall next to Brownhills High 
School is an area which is knicknamed  
Â£Scobo'.This used to be part of an old 
railway sidings,but the rails have gone
and the land has been reclaimed.       
                                In     
Scobo there is a sewer,there are three 
bridges over this.There are pathways   
leading to the school,and there is a   
fishing pond.By the pond there are two 
old lamposts,and benches.One pathway   
leads to a tunnel which goes to        
Westport Lake.                         
              Scobo is used for walking
and fishing,it is part of what is      
called the Â£Greenway' which is a series
of paths which are reclaimed land in   
Stoke-on-Trent,and has gained national 
and international fame.
