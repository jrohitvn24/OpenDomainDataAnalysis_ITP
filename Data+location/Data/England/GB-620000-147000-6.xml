		<title>06     Prehistoric Barham.</title>
		<content>Millions of years ago mammoths roamed  
the Elham valley floor.Some workmen    
found two skeletons of mammoths with   
teeth weighing 11 lbs under the Barham 
football pitch in 1932.There are the   
remains of 103 round barrows near      
Derringstone Hill Farm on the Barham   
Downs.One tumulus contained beads      
and a perforated crystal ball.Another  
one nearby contained the famous        
Kingston Brooch,now in Liverpool       
museum.Some mid-bronze age axe heads   
were found in a newly ploughed field   
by a twelve year old boy in 1965.They  
were at least three thousand years     
old.The A2(T) follows the course of    
the Roman Watling Street,which ran     
from Dover to London via Canterbury.It 
is believed that Julius Caesar's army  
camped out on Barham Downs on their    
way to London.Roman coins have been    
found nearby.                          </content>
