 breeds, but cross-breeds are now      
 favoured, promoting better growth and 
 carcusses.                            
    The{ewes}usually have their{lambs} 
 in March. They are turned out to grass
 until after 16 to 20 weeks the        
 lambs are ready for slaughter. The    
 ewe's fleece is{sheared}in June and is
 worth Â£3.                             
    To prevent worms each lamb is      
 drenched every 3 weeks and all are    
 dipped twice against sheep scab. Lambs
 not ready for slaughter are weaned on 
 to lush grass or fattened on a catch  
 crop of rape, stubble or turnips.

 30 ewes for about 6 weeks. The ewes   
 stay in the fields until Christmas    
 when they are brought in and fed on   
 silage or hay and concentrates until  
 lambing.                              </content>
