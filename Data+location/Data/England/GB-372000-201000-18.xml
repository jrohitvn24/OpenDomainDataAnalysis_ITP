		<content>   Most of the houses in this area are 
 reasonably old farmhouses as this is  
 a largely agricultural area.In        
 Cambridge there is a row of brick     
 houses dating from between 1815 and   
 1857(some bearing commemorative       
 plaques) for the farmworkers. Outside 
 the village a few modern bungalows    
 have been built.                      
   In Slimbridge most of the older     
 houses have been pulled down and      
 replaced by more modern two storey    
 houses although the actual village    
 existed before the Norman Invasion.   
 This is proven by the Church which was
 built in the eleventh century.        
   Out from Cambridge and into the     
 surrounding countryside one comes     
 across many old farmhouses converted  
 into private residences.These contrast
 with the terraced houses in Cambridge.
