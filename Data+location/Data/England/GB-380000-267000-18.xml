		<content> by Paul McCammon                      
 I am 12 years old,and I go to the     
 Windmill C.E. Middle School. Stourport
 on Severn.                            
 I get up at 07:30 every weekday,I get 
 dressed into my school uniform,and    
 then have my breakfast,usually cereals
 and coffee.I leave for school at about
 08:20.School starts at 09:00,with an  
 assemblely,and after this we read for 
 15 minutes.                           
 I am in the 4th year of our school,so 
 we are grouped for some subjects.My   
 worst subject is French.              
 We leave school at 15:45.When I get   
 home,I play on my computer.After my   
 tea I go out to play until 20:30.When 
 I get in I watch the television or    
 read until I go to bed at 22:00.      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
