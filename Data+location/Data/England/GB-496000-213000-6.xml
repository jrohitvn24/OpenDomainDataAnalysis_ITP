		<content>  Jarman lived in the Manor House in   
 the 18th century.He was said to have  
 been crossed in love and then killed  
 himself.The ghost of Jarman was said  
 to ride a blue headless horse down to 
 Bluepit Pond with two white horses    
 which he watered on the green.Jarman  
 plays tricks with the lights (and is  
 still said to do so) on one particular
 day of the year.                      
  Rosina Jane Massey,father of General 
 Massey, a writer,lived in Witchcraft  
 in the 1850's.Rosina was reputed of   
 always being drunk and to have strange
 powers.On one occasion she went out   
 collecting wood chips.When rebuked by 
 other woodcutters she cast a spell on 
 them so their axes stayed in the      
 trees, and collected all their wood   
 chips.She did many other strange      
 things and died in 1866.
