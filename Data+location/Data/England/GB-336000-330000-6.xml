		<title>06The Broome; a typical farm</title>
		<content>  Broome Farm is mechanised and employs
 only two  labourers. Its 360 acres are
 divided   120 barley, 100 silage, with
 the  rest grazing, they no longer grow
 sugar beet. Most of the barley is used
 to  make cattle cake. 130 Friesians of
 the dairy  unit and 60 "followers" are
 kept inside between October and April.
 The 50 head beef unit  stay inside all
 of  the  time. A  Welsh  farmer  rents
 winter  grazing  for 150 sheep. Unlike
 most local farmers, they use AI to put
 cows in calf. Heifers produce Limousin
 crosses in  August or September  which
 go into a  beef unit while the rest of
 the  dairy  unit calf  between October
 and December.This ensures a year round
 supply  of milk to  the local dairy at
 Ellesmere. The cows are milked twice a
 day and, at present, the farm is above
 its EEC quota.Old cows and beef cattle
 are sold at Oswestry market.          </content>
