		<title>07Recreation in Bacup</title>
		<content> There are quite a lot of activities   
 for people living in the Rossendale   
 Valley area but they often have to    
 travel outside our study grid to towns
 like Rawtenstall, Waterfoot, Stubbins,
 Haslingden or Ramsbottom.             
 In Bacup there is a new Leisure Hall. 
 If we want to do something in our     
 spare time these are the activities   
 they provide:_ squash,badminton,table 
 tennis and dancing. Groups and clubs  
 in the area hire the hall for plays,  
 meetings,exhibitions,dog shows and    
 antique fairs.                        
 There is a riding school near Weir    
 where Simona goes. She goes for a two 
 hour lesson and it costs her Â£3. Other
 children go running. They train on    
 Tuesday and Thursday nights and it    
 costs just 25pence.
