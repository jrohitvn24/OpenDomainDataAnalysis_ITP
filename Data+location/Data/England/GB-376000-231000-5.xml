		<title>05Pendock's principle features</title>
		<content> In Pendock and the area around it     
 houses are far apart so people can't  
 get together very often.Also children 
 can't play with their friends a lot   
 unless they are at school.Most people 
 in Pendock as well as having cars have
 telephones because it is a quicker way
 to talk to people.Every Tuesday while 
 the school-children are swimming in   
 school there is a mothers and toddlers
 group and the mothers can talk to each
 other.Also the post office is a place 
 where people can have a chat.         
             Pendock is divided into   
 two halves Upper Pendock and Lower    
 Pendock.The Parish Church is in Upper 
 Pendock so a wooden church was built  
 in Lower Pendock and is called Pendock
 Cross Church.The church was built     
 because most people live in Lower     
 Pendock.
