		<title>13THE SPEECH OF PETROCKSTOWE</title>
		<content> Many accents are heard, from BBC Eng- 
 lish through 'Brum and Geordie to     
 Cockney, but{Devonian predominates.}To
 the outsider it is odd to hear a mare 
 or bitch called "ee" or a man referred
 to as "'er". Most farm stock sounds   
 male: female cattle are only called   
 cows if in calf or giving milk; and   
 no-one refers to a sow although I've  
 seen a lot of piglets! 'We will' is   
 always 'us'll'. Normal conversation is
 lazy, with letters omitted. Any time  
 past is 'backalong', and outsiders,   
 including those from Exeter, are from 
 "up Country". Of course the Devonian  
 is able to "talk proper", but if 3 or 
 4 get together, &amp; get enthusiastic or 
 cross, or have taken of the farm cider
 the outsider can easily get lost.     
 Devonians turn the accent on quite de-
 liberately to fool the foreigners, &amp; I
 as one, hope they continue to do so.  </content>
