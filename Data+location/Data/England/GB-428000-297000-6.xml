		<content>  An Act of Parliament in 1845 allowed 
 the Trent Valley Railway Company to   
build a line that would enable the most
direct route from Manchester to London(
by-passing Birmingham).Land was secured
from William Stratford Dugdale,M.P. and
in 1856 the station and twin tracks    
were built.Coal,wool,grain and cattle  
were collected by Red Lion omnibus.The 
railway became the second largest      
employer in town.An increase to four   
tracks and further buildings occurred  
in the early 1900's,later to be        
demolished in the 1960's.The line      
joined the London,Midland and Scottish 
Railway in 1923 which was later taken  
over by British Rail in 1947.The line  
was electrified in 1964 but owing to   
declining traffic the station became an
unmanned halt in 1972.The station      
building has Listed Building Status and
was restored in 1984.                  </content>
