		<content> A single line track runs through the  
 area, to a terminus in Kings Lynn. A  
 station within the area has long been 
 closed, and all that remains there are
 two railway houses, a rough platform  
 and a level crossing.                 
                                       
 The crossing has recently been made   
 automatic, with barriers and warning  
 noises as a train approaches. The     
 crossing keeper still lives in his    
 railway house, but has been           
 transferred to work in Cambridge. He  
 is transported by rail every day!
