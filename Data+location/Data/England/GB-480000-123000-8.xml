		<title>08Housing in Rogate</title>
		<content>     The houses in the centre of the   
 village are all different but those on
 the council estate are  mostly the    
 same design.  Some in the middle of   
 the village are made of stone, those  
 on the estate are made of concrete.   
 The newest ones have lots of large    
 windows, that was the fashion when    
 they were built in the 1960s. Sliding 
 windows can still be seen which       
 suggest these places were built before
 the 18th century. Some roofs are made 
 out of tiles or slates but several    
 have thatch.                          
     East Lodge is a sheltered housing 
 building with lots of flats for old   
 people, a resident warden helps       
 them. All the homes have  well        
 tended gardens with gay, brightly     
 coloured flowers. Rogate has won the  
 best kept village at least twice. It  
 came third this year.                 </content>
