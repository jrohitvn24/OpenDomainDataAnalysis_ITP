		<title>02Community Life in Stoulton</title>
		<content>                                       
     People interviewed around Stoulton
 included the wife of the former       
 sacristan of the village church.      
 During her forty years there, she has 
 experienced many changes including the
 construction of the main road to      
 Drakes Broughton and the demise of the
 railway. People like the village      
 because, although it is quiet, it is  
 still linked to nearby towns by a     
 regular bus service.                  
     The owner of the former village   
 shop is now a handyman because the    
 shop lost money and his family needed 
 more accommodation.                   
     A lifelong villager had refused to
 permit demolition of her house to make
 way for the new road.  Usually, she   
 watches television for entertainment. 
     Villages use the shops and other  
 facilities of Pershore and Worcester. </content>
