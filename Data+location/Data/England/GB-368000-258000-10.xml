		<content> The church at Lower Sapey is at the   
 end of a very long lane. The Church is
 now falling to ruin, although some    
 degree of restoration work has been   
 undertaken. It is of Norman           
 foundation, with a south doorway  and 
 in the West a small window also       
 Norman.                               
 The exterior is built of cob and daub,
 and the inside walls are plastered.   
 Part of the West gallery survives.    
 Sapey Brook flows past the Church to  
 join the Teme at Knightsford. Near to 
 Sapey Church there is an old half     
 timbered farmhouse with the remains of
 a moat or pond.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
