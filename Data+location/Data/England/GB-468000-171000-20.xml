{brickworks}and the sandbuckets        
 collected sand from Kentwood Hill to  
 carry back across the bottom of       
 Grovelands Road at the junction with  
 Water Road into the brickworks.All    
 that remains is the War Memorial      
 in Water Road.At the bottom of        
 Grovelands Road was a small stream,   
 and a small but dense wood,where      
 children used to build camps.The site 
 abounded with Dragonflies in summer.  
 Many of the houses in Grovelands Road 
 were built from Colliers brickworks.
