Today there are no railway stations in 
the area of study. At one time there   
was one at Cresswell on the main line  
which runs from Stoke to Derby and one 
at Totmonslow on a branch line from    
Cresswell to Cheadle.                  
                                       
This branch line is still in existance 
but B.R. say that it is disused,       
although occasional special trains do  
run to Cheadle with passengers for     
Alton Towers.                          
                                       
Field evidence does show that this line
was re-routed at some time, as a       
disused tunnel can still be seen, close
Draycott Cross. Discovery of this      
tunnel put us in mind of an Enid Blyton
Famous Five story!
