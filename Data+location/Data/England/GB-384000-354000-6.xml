		<content>I HAVE A BROTHER ANDREW AND A SISTER   
JOANNE. MY BROTHER IS TAKING HIS       
EXAMS THIS YEAR. JOANNE WATCHES        
TELEVISION IN HER SPARE TIME. MY DAD   
IS A MECHANIC ON CARS AND HE ONLY      
HAS A DAY OFF ON SUNDAYS. MY MUM       
STAYS IN THE HOUSE BUT ON FRIDAYS      
SHE GOES SHOPPING AND ON TUESDAYS      
SHE GOES TO MY NANA'S AND MY NANA      
BUYS US SOME SWEETS AND A TOY.         
WHEN WE ARE AT SCHOOL ON A SUNNY DAY   
MY MUM IS OUT SUNBATHING IN THE BACK   
GARDEN AND WHEN MY DAD COMES IN HE     
SAYS "WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING ALL     
DAY?" SOMETIMES I PLAY WITH ALISON AND 
WE PLAY ROUNDERS OR ONE MAN STAND. SO  
WHEN I GO IN I HAVE A DRINK AND A BICKY
AND GO TO BED. THE NEXT MORNING OUR    
HOME LIFE STARTS ALL OVER AGAIN.
