		<title>17THE PUBS IN THE AREA 5</title>
		<content> as a local person. On 'pay-day' the   
 pub is crammed not with iron and coal 
 workers, as it would have been thirty 
 years ago, but with office and        
 management personnel from the town    
 centre or the large industrial        
 estates. The gardens are carefully    
 tended and there are two large car    
 parks. Despite this modernity, the pub
 shows its local traditions by still   
 running darts and pool teams all year.
 There is a dominoes team, an air rifle
 team, and it is the headquarters of   
 Snedshill F.Club. The 'All Labour in  
 Vain' has taken advantage of its      
 position on one of the old coaching   
 roads. In its trade and appearance it 
 reflects the way that Telford's       
 past, when Telford did not exist, is  
 being moulded by the present and how  
 even the pub must bring itself into   
 the post-industrial age.              </content>
