		<title>05ROWHEATH FARM  etc.</title>
		<content>  Rowheath Farm is an{arable}farm with 
 around 98 acres. It is a{freehold}farm
 unlike many other{tenant}farms in the 
 area, and grows{sugar-beet},{oil seed 
{rape},{wheat}and{barley.}The farm used
 to keep{pigs,}but this did not prove  
 successful so they sold them.         
  The third farm that we visited was   
 Ampers Wick{beef}farm which breeds    
 cattle. They sell their produce to    
 store all over East Anglia.           
   Finally we visited High Birch farm  
 which used to farm{Peartree Pork      
{Products}but now farms chickens, beans
 and oats. They own 41 acres of land.  
 The reason for the turn away from pork
 farming was the drop in sales a few   
 years ago.                            
   All the farms have been affected by 
 the weather and many are behind their 
 proposed schedule.
