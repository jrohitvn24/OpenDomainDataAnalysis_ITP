		<content> The area studied was totally rural.   
 The main parish within the boundaries 
 was Rushock. This cannot be called a  
 village, because the settlement is    
 dispersed. The farms are relatively   
 small and mixed. Although several have
 changed hands in recent years, there  
 has been no sale to large scale       
 organisations. The farms are still    
 family businesses. There is one church
 built in the 18th century, at Rushock.
 It formed part of the Chaddesley      
 Corbett Estate. The children attend   
 first school in Cutnall Green, and    
 then transfer to Droitwich for middle 
 and high schooling. There is one shop/
 post office within the parish. Most   
 inhabitants do their main shopping in 
 Droitwich or Kidderminster. There are 
 "newcomers" in the area. They commute 
 to towns in the area, and to          
 Birmingham. Public transport is poor. </content>
