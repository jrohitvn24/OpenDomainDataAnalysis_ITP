		<content>   We asked people how many cars they  
 had or if they had ,if they had one,or
 if they travelled by bus to do        
 their shopping. Some of the older     
 people do not have cars, but quite    
 a lot of familes have two cars. The   
 young people used bicycles a lot.     
   We asked people where  they shopped 
 for groceries, clothes and larger     
 items like furniture and electrical   
 goods. Most people did most of their  
 shopping in Cirencester, though others
 went to Chelterham or Swindon for big 
 items. The nearest small grocer's shop
 is in Bibury.                         
   Everybody we asked had a            
 telephone,and quite a lot of people   
 had two. Everybody had a fridge and   
 nearly everybody had a washing        
 machine, though fewer people had      
 freezers and video-recorders and very 
 few had dish-washers.                 </content>
