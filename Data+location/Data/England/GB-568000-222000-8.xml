		<title>08  THE SUPERNATURAL</title>
		<content> The Fillols held Old Hall for 200     
 years up until 1720 and the house     
 is said to be haunted by old Filo     
 whose body is buried under a pew      
 belonging to the mansion in the local 
 church at Rayne. Mr.Sexton,the present
 owner has seen no evidence of the     
 supernatural at Old Hall but knows    
 that a previous owner committed       
 suicide by slitting his throat in an  
 upstairs room. An Ex_employee of Old  
 Hall was one day washing up in the    
 kitchen with a small dog beside her.  
 The dog started shaking and barking.  
 This made her turn round. She saw what
 she described as "a willowey shape" in
 front of the door. It quickly         
 vanished. It was at then that she     
 decided to give up her job and return 
 to her previous employment....working 
 in an office.
