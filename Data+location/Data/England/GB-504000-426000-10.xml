		<title>10THE OLD FISH DOCK: W. HULL</title>
		<content>                                       
         {St.Andrews Dock. }           
                                       
     The dock is on the River Humber,  
 approximately 2 miles from Hull city  
 centre.                               
     The dock is not busy at all.There 
 are no ships in sight.There are some  
 lock gates, all silted up, not being  
 used any more.One bit of dock is      
 nearly all mud and no water.          
     There is a strong smell of fish   
 from the nearby fish factories.This   
 fish comes in container lorries from  
 other parts of the country.           
     There are hardly any men working  
 except for some stacking wooden       
 pallets near the side of the dock.    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
