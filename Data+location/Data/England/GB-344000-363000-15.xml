		<content> Three generations of the present      
 farmers family have farmed this land  
 since 1875.It is the biggest farm in  
 the district and is part of the huge  
 Westminster Estate.It is primarily a  
 Dairy Farm with 300 Friesian cows,but 
 also produces arable crops including  
 sugar beet,peas,barley and wheat.The  
 wheat crop is sprayed to prevent      
 mildew,and modern growing techniques  
 result in a yield of 3 or more tonnes 
 per acre.One field produces hay for   
 feeding calves ,but most of the feed  
 in winter is silage. 2.800tonnes are  
 cut and stored each year.There are    
 also 80 beef cattle. Milking is at    
 4.30 a.m. and 2.30p.m. In 1930 it took
 14 men to lok after 140 cows.In 1985 6
 men look after 300.The improvements in
 technology that have taken place has  
 meant that the milk yield has doubled 
 over this same period.                </content>
