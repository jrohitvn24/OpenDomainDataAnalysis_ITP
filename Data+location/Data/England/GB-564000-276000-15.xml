    NO SURVEY OF WEST ROW WOULD BE     
COMPLETE WITHOUT A REFERENCE TO THE    
MILDENHALL TREASURE WHICH IS HOUSED IN 
THE BRITISH MUSEUM.                    
    IT WAS FOUND IN 1942 AT WEST ROW IN
A FIELD BETWEEN WESTON DITCH AND THE   
GREEN. IT CONSISTS OF 34 PIECES OF VERY
HIGH QUALITY SILVERWARE AND WAS        
PROBABLY BURIED BY ITS ROMAN OWNERS IN 
TROUBLED TIMES TOWARDS THE END OF THE  
ROMAN OCCUPATION.                      
    THE TREASURE WAS UNEARTHED AFTER   
DEEP-PLOUGHING WHICH WAS INTRODUCED    
DURING THE WAR. IT WAS NOT UNTIL 4     
YEARS AFTER ITS DISCOVERY THAT ITS     
VALUE WAS REALISED BY THE TWO MEN WHO  
FOUND IT.                              
    DECLARED TREASURE TROVE BY AN      
INQUEST AT MILDENHALL IN 1946, IT WAS  
PUT ON PUBLIC DISPLAY THE SAME YEAR.
