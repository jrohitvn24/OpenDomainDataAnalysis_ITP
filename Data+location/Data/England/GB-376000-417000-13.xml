		<title>13THE CHATTERTON RIOT IN 1826</title>
		<content> In the early years of the 19th century
 the Corn Laws were introduced to      
 protect farmers,which made the price  
 of bread high.The factory workers     
 believed that if they smashed all the 
 new machines it would make more work  
 for them,so that they could afford the
 higher bread prices.                  
 On{23 April 1826},rioters from        
 Haslingden came to{Chatterton}.They   
 came to smash power looms which they  
 feared would put them out of work,at  
 Aitken's mill.They were met by armed  
 soldiers and Major Grant,the local    
 magistrate.Major Grant read the Riot  
 Act and told the rioters to go home.  
 They refused and in the following     
 fight six people were killed and many 
 injured.Later the ringleaders were    
 arrested and sentenced to death.
