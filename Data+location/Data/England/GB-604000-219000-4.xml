		<title>04Employment in Alresford</title>
		<content> Alresford does not have great         
 potential as a source of employment   
 and because of this many people seek  
 work outside the village, often com-  
 muting to either Colchester or London 
 Within the village there are 3 main   
 employment opportunities: the gravel  
 works, cement works and the small but 
 busy shopping centre. This consists of
 thirteen shops which together employ a
 total of thirty-five people.          
  Although Alresford is basically seen 
 as an agricultural area very few      
 people actually work on the land.  Due
 to a series of mergers there are now  
 only 2 farms within the village and   
 these are managed by outsiders who    
 view agriculture as a profitable con- 
 cern.  The farms tend to be organised 
 on a business footing with agents em- 
 ployed by the investment companies    
 concerned.                            </content>
