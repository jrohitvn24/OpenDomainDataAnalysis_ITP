   Talbot Woods is teeming with wild-  
 life. It's important to have a        
 woodland area because many people     
 like to relax and walk through it     
 or jog,walk their dog or just sit on  
 a bench and admire the wildlife.      
   Foxes live in the area, you can of- 
 ten hear their cries at night. They   
 also come into the town looking for   
 food.                                 
   Insect-eating bats also populate the
 woods, you'd see them at night search-
 ing for moths and mosquitoes.         
   Mice live here, field mice and dor- 
 mice are most common. Field mice are  
 largely nocturnal, they are prey of   
 tawny owls and barn owls. Confined    
 to the woods by day, they emerge to-  
 wards dusk in search of voles, field  
 mice,moles and other small animals.
