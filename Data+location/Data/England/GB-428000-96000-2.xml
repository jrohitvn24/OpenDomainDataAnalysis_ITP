		<content>  Out of the many farms in the area 3  
 were visited.                         
{ Manor Farm}borders on to the New     
 Forest. The tenant farmers arrived    
 here 49 years ago from Sturminster    
 Newton bringing all their livestock   
 and equipment by train.At first all   
 work in the field was undertaken by   
 horses and it wasn't until 1943 that  
 they had their first tractor.During   
 the{war}Manor Farm was an emergency   
 landing field and at one time 10      
 planes were parked in the field. Three
 bombs fell in the fields near by.     
  The farm comprises of 110 acres      
 approximately 1 acre per animal and 40
 acres for hay.They have 58 steers and 
 horses altogether. They used to have  
 70 dairy cattle but now concentrate on
{beef cattle}which go to slaughter in  
 Hordle.Stock is gradually being run   
 down prior to retirement this year.   </content>
