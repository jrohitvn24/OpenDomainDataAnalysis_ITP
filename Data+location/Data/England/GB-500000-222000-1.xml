 In South East Dunstable the housing   
 can be divided into two groups.The    
 older is found along the Luton Road   
 and consists of "between_wars"ribbon  
 developments of semi_detatched and    
 terraced houses,with occasional       
 bungalows between.The newer houses    
 were built post World War II about    
 1950_1960 and"in_filled the areas     
 between Luton Road and Blows          
 Downs.This newer housing consists of  
 semi_detatched houses and bungalows   
 with a few flats and                  
 maisonettes.Nowadays nearly all houses
 have inside bathrooms and toilets with
 piped water (both hot &amp; cold)and are  
 connected to mains drainage.All are   
 supplied with either gas or           
 electricity and many have both.
