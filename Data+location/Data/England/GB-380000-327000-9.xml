		<title>09The Law in Eccleshall</title>
		<content> The first petty sessions recorded at  
 Eccleshall were held in 185i, monthly,
 at the Royal Oak. In 1876 the court   
 moved to the Town Hall and in 1912 a  
 new Court House was opened in the High
 Street, comprising a police court,    
 magistrates' room and clerk's office. 
 Today the same court house is used,   
 with two, occasionally three, courts  
 held every Friday except Good Friday. 
 There are 13 magistrates: 6 ladies and
 7 men. The{Police Authority}now owns  
 the building, part of which is used as
 a police station. There is a cell, and
 a pound for stray dogs. The majority  
 of the motoring offences take place on
 the M6 motorway, which traverses the  
 Eccleshall area. {Eccleshall Magistr- 
{ates' Bench}is part of the Stafford,  
 Stone and Eccleshall division, the    
 clerk's office being in the new court 
 premises in Stafford.                 </content>
