		<title>03THE WHITE CLIFFS OF RAMSGATE</title>
		<content>Ramsgate first developed as a fishing  
port in a gap in the white cliffs,which
dominate the coastline.They are made of
chalk which is a soft rock.Because of  
the softness,changes are being made at 
the cliff-face.Weaknesses or fault-    
lines are attacked by waves and small  
caves begin to form.The fissures become
wider,caves collapse and inlets or geos
are formed.The East and West Cliffs are
protected from sea-erosion by roads and
beaches.However,the cliffs are still   
unstable and chalk falls have occurred.
Several stretches along the West Cliff 
have been re-inforced with concrete    
over the past few years.The East Cliff 
has more stability due to the          
strengthening work done some years ago.
When the new by-pass road is built,    
taking constant heavy traffic along    
the base of the cliffs,what effect will
vibrations have on the cliff structure?</content>
