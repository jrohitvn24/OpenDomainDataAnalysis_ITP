		<title>12CARE FOR THE ELDERLY</title>
		<content>     There are three types of care for 
 the elderly in our area. Independant, 
 Warden and Full-time care.            
  Shuttleworth Court is an estate      
 forindependant care. People there can 
 do things for themselves such as      
 cooking and cleaning.                 
  Grinter House is a mixture of flats  
 and flatlets. People in the flats are 
 still independant but they can buzz   
 for a warden to come to give them     
 help. The people in the flatlets have 
 a daily helper as well as a warden.   
  Beckside is a new Fully Dependant    
 home for the elderly. Here the people 
 are looked after by staff all of the  
 time. They have their meals cooked for
 them and their rooms cleaned for them.
 This home is for old people who cannot
 look after themseleves. I think this  
 home ia a great place. The residents  
 are happy and the staff are kind.     </content>
