		<content> On the 17th June we interviewed Lady  
 Shakerley and Mrs. Margaret Hill who  
 have lived in Petworth nearly all     
 their lives. They remembered what     
 Petworth was like quite a while ago   
 when Mr. Baxter was blacksmith in Park
 Road. People of Petworth used to bring
 their horses to have horseshoes made  
 and mended. They also remembered Mr.  
 Knight. When the Fair couldn't come   
 during the War, Mr. Knight would put  
 up a wooden stall in the Square to    
 sell things and keep the royal charter
 going. In the old schools they didn't 
 go on school trips until 1951 when Mr.
 Hill was headmaster. They also        
 recalled that there were 6 schools, 3 
 state schools and 3 private schools.  
 The Infants School was on the site of 
 the new library, The Boy's School was 
 in North St., the girls in East St.
