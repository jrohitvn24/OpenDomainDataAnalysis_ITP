		<content> Mr. Gagg employs twelve male farm     
 workers and thirty five ladies who    
 work in the packing department.His    
 farm which covers eight hundred acres 
 grows carrots,parsnips,turnips,peas   
 and potatoes.Throughout the whole     
 business eighty five people are       
 employed .New machinery installed this
 year packs over  one thousand five    
 hundread tons of carrots annually.With
 the growth in fresh food production it
 is expected that the business will    
 expand by fifty per cent in the next  
 two or three years.Much of the        
 increased production will go to export
 markets.The main problems in growing  
 vegetables  on a commercial basis in  
 Swinderby are the changeable weather  
 and the constant attack by insects.
