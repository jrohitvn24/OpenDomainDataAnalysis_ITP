		<title>20ATTITUDES: PROJECT AND GROUP</title>
		<content> I liked doing the{Domesday Project    
 because I had only just moved to      
 Potton so I was very interested to see
 where I actually lived. I found out   
 quite a bit about{Potton }just by     
 going out on trips and meeting people 
 and them telling us about parts of    
 Potton.                               
 Two classes took part in this         
 project and we each looked at six     
 squares of our block. We are all      
 children in the 7 to 9 age group and  
 our classes are called{Royal}and{Red.}
 There are 34 children in each class.
