		<title>19CHESS CHAMPION AT ELLISTOWN</title>
		<content>                                       
 Seven-year-old Andrew Calderwood,     
 who lives in Whitehill Road,          
 Ellistown, has become Britain's       
 youngest chess champion.              
   He won the Lloyds Bank Trophy at a  
 national tournament in London.        
   Andrew finished top of his age group
 by winning seven out of eight matches.
 Competitors were invited to the       
 tournament by  the British Chess      
 Federation and Andrew was the second  
 youngest there.                       
   Andrew's father, Ivan, taught him   
 the game and he says he has progressed
 by watching other players.            
   The tournament which marked Andrew's
 first main success was sponsored by   
 Lloyds Bank as part of Â£30,000 worth  
 of backing for young players.
