		<content>    My favourite walk takes you through
 the High street and down School Hill, 
 on the way you pass several houses,   
 six fields, a shed, a sign post and a 
 farm. If you turn right you will pass 
 more fields and cross a stile; you are
 almost at Bateman's. Take a left past 
 another field and a car park, cross   
 over the bridge with a stream below   
 it, pass two more fields and a stile, 
 after this you can see the Water-mill 
 and Bateman's gardens' come into view.
 The mill pond is clearly visible and  
 you can hear the mill-race as the     
 water enters the narrow part where the
 mill wheel scoops up the water to     
 drive the grind stones. Then you cross
 another field and a stream, a weir can
 be heard before you can see it, then  
 you go into a wood and step onto a    
 bridge, this is the River Dudwell that
 meets the sea at Rye.                 </content>
