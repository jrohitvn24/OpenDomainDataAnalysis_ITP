		<content>     Outside St. Andrew's church porch 
which is big with seats along the      
inside, there is a black foot scraper. 
Some of the pews have poppy heads on   
the ends. The hammerbeam roof is also  
carved. The stone font at the back of  
the church has eight sides with some   
lovely patterns on and it is one       
hundred and twelve years old. There is 
a baptismal roll. On the wall inside   
there is a brass of Leonard Farrington 
and his wife with their children, six  
boys and two girls. Each hassock has a 
different British flower embroidered   
on it by local needlewomen. The        
lectern is brass and shaped like an    
eagle standing on a ball. There is an  
organ near the altar. The church and   
bottom of the tower are built of       
flint. Old wills state that the tower  
was being built in  1452, but a red    
brick top was added in Tudor times.    </content>
