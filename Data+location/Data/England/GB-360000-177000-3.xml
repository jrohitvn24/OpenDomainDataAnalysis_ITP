		<title>03St.Peter's Church</title>
		<content> A group of children visited St.Peters 
 Church .We found that it was built    
 before 1340.The first burial was in   
 1352,a man called John Wilkin who was 
 killed by thieves.An old stone coffin 
 has been found.This is over 1000 years
 old.The first school in Filton was in 
 the Church tower.It was only big      
 enough for 18 children.The church has 
 a hagioscope.This is a tiny window    
 through which poor or diseased people 
 watched the church services.Only the  
 wealthy were able to go inside.       
   The church was used as a mortuary   
 after a bomb raid on the aircraft     
 works in 1940.                        
 Today many activities go on in the    
 church and church hall.There are 3    
 Sunday services including Family      
 worship at 10.a.m.There is a youth    
 club, and a mothers and toddlers      
 group.The hall can be rented.         </content>
