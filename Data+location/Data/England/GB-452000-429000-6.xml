		<content> At the top of the block there is the  
 Leeds to Selby railway,which was      
 opened on the 22nd October 1834,It    
 cost Â£210,000 to be made.But when the 
 line was built they had some          
 difficulties for instance the 200 yard
 tunnel through Richmond Hill outside  
 Leeds and another bridge near         
 Garforth.The fare from Leeds to Selby 
 was 3s(15p) first class.In an old book
 it told us about an accident near to  
 Hambleton station(there is no trace of
 a station before)which happened on the
 5th May 1853.The accident was an      
 engine running of the line causing the
 death of John Thompson the engine     
 driver and Joseph Sykes the           
 stoker.Nowadays diesel trains travel  
 on the line going to Leeds to Selby   
 York and Hull.
