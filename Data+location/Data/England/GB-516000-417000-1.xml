 The area lies on the banks of the{    
{River Humber.}The land was in the past
 a {drained marsh area} for farming but
 in recent years has been developed for
{industry.}Interesting locations       
 include:{North Killingholme Haven,}a  
 small harbour and industrial area with
 industry, a pub and two houses for    
 sale. Near here we find {old brick    
{ponds}with {wild birds. The Humber    
{Wall,}a sea defence separating the    
 coastal salt marsh and mud from the   
 inland areas. A{disused railway}runs  
 through the area. Three lighthouses,  
 one lived in, others abandoned.The {  
{smallholding}on Station Road and many 
 large industrial areas. Very few      
 people live in the area which is now  
 dominated by often dangerous industry.
