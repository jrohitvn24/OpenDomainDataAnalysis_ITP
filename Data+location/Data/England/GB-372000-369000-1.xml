 At 7.15 I woke up and switched the    
 T.V. on.After watching for about 30   
 minutes I went downstairs and had     
 breakfast.  For breakfast I had a     
 boiled egg and strips of toast.  At   
 8.30 we went to the shop and I helped 
 set the shop up.  I loaded the rubbish
 into the van.  Then I went to Taylor's
 to get the papers.  At 10 AM I went to
 Nan's for dinner.  For dinner I had a 
 bun, baked beans and chips.  Then we  
 watched TV till 5.05 PM when Mum came 
 for my sister and I.  When we got home
 cousin Phil was there and we worked on
 the computer.  Then Phil went for his 
 tea and I had mine.  We had new       
 potatoes, chops and cauliflower.  Then
 Phil and I played soccer for a while. 
 Phil went home.  I watched TV and went
 to bed.
