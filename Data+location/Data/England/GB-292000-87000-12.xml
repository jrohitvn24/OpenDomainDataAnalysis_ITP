		<title>12The Countess Wear Area</title>
		<content> Countess Wear lies about 3 miles south
 of Exeter city centre. It is a        
 residential suburb. A few houses on   
 Topsham Road and Glasshouse Lane were 
 built before 1945 but most have been  
 built in the 1950's as a planned      
 council estate.                       
                                       
 The estate is well layed out and      
 planned. It is built of a fairly low  
 density and it has many grassed areas 
 for recreation and amenity. There is  
 good service provision in the area. A 
 small shopping precinct, a primary and
 middle school form a focal point for  
 the estate. The 100 Club which is a   
 youth club on the estate is very      
 popular with the youngsters both in   
 the evenings and during the school    
 holidays. There is a clinic and a     
 church which has a church hall for    
 gatherings.                           </content>
