		<content>                                       
 The Grand Shaft consists of three     
 stairways that are built into the     
 cliffs at Snargate Street,Dover.      
                                       
 They were used to get from the        
 barracks at the Citadel to the town   
 centre and the docks.                 
                                       
 The shaft was built during the        
 Napoleonic Wars in case of a raid on  
 Dover by the French.If there was a    
 raid the troops could be transferred  
 to the bottom of the cliffs where they
 could then be deployed to wherever    
 they were needed.                     
                                       
 The different stairways were used by  
 the three different classes; one for  
 Ladies and Gentlemen,one for Officers 
 and one for troops.Passes were issued 
 in different colours for each stairway</content>
