		<title>08CALF HEATH VILLAGE</title>
		<content>Calf Heath is a small village lying    
midway between junctions ll and l2 of  
the M6.The major factor bringing change
to the village was the opening of the  
M6 over 2O years ago,the long term     
results of which are only now apparent.
Close proximity to the M6 makes the    
area very appealing to families wishing
to live in the country and commute to  
Birmingham.As this area is designated  
green belt no new building is allowed, 
consequently over the years as old farm
cottages have become vacant these have 
been purchased at inflated prices by   
property speculators,almost knocked    
down and then re-built as luxury modern
houses thus changing the character of  
the village.The price of these are     
beyond the means of most local couples 
who are forced to leave the village    
when marrying and buying a home.
