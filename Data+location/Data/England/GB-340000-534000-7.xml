		<content> From a survey of Skelton farms the    
 average size is 188.3 acres. The      
 survey also showed that 84% of        
 farmland was grass. Animals kept on   
 farms were cows, sheep, ewes with     
 lambs, bullocks and heifers. Crops    
 grown were barley, typhon, turnips,   
 hay and silage.                       
 Most farms are highly mechanised      
 and machines include tractor, trailer,
 square bailer, muckspreader, slurry   
 spreader, elevator, forager, mower,   
 seed drill, plough and harrow. Very   
 expensive machinery is hired as       
 required.                             
 The average price of land is Â£2000 per
 acre. A good dairy cow can cost Â£750, 
 a dairy calf Â£80 and a beef calf Â£150.
 The price of a grey faced sheep is Â£80
 and a lamb Â£45.
