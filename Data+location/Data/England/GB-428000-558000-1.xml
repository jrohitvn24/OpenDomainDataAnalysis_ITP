		<content>    The block divides into three areas:
 the{North and West}is high density    
{housing,}some post war but definitely 
 overspill from the Tyneside           
 conurbation.  In the{South and East   
 is the Northern edge of{Washington New
{Town,}including the Development       
 Corporation Headquarters and mainly   
 private and Council housing.  Between 
 is a broad{greenbelt}of agricultural  
 land on which New Town development is 
 forbidden. The region's prosperity    
 hinged on coal mining and associated  
 industries. Little  of this remains.  
 In its place are{lighter industries,  
 an emphasis upon the service sector   
 and{leisure.}The New Town population  
 consists of old established families, 
 people from Sunderland and Newcastle  
 and those attracted by jobs. There is 
 good provision of public transport,   
 schools, churches and social welfare. </content>
