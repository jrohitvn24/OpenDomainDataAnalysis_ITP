		<title>09FARMING IN LITTLEDALE</title>
		<content>The land around Caton and Brookhouse   
is farmland and farming is the major   
industry in the area.There are 17      
farms in all in our block,ranging in   
size from 70 to 240 acres.As the land  
is hilly, it is not suitable for crops 
and the vast majority of the farmland  
is grazing or meadowland.Most of these 
farms are run by the farmer alone,but  
the highest number working on any farm 
is 3.The busiest time of the year is   
haytiming when relatives and friends   
are called in to help out.Each farm    
has different machinery but all farms  
have at least one tractor.The largest  
farm,Pott Yeats,has 3 tractors,till    
drill, muck spreader,slurry spreader,  
mower, helipede and numerous trailers. 
All the farms keep sheep and cattle,   
both dairy and beef.Many of the        
farmhouses are very old,the oldest,    
Annas Ghyll,dating from 1664.          </content>
