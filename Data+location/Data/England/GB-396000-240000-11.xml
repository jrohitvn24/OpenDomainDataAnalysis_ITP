		<title>11ELMLEY CASTLE, WAY OF LIFE</title>
		<content> Since the Second World War the        
 population has changed from a         
 community of old families to one of   
 commuters and retired people.People   
 who choose to live in this popular    
 area are prepared to travel for shops,
 services and employment.Most families 
 have a car.The shops and post offices 
 in Elmley Castle and Little Comberton 
 closed last year. A mobile grocer,    
 greengrocer and library call weekly.  
 Newspapers can be collected from      
 outside village halls.The Parish      
 Magazine is delivered free monthly to 
 all homes.Social life centres around  
 the village halls,public houses ,the  
 Church and private homes.             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
