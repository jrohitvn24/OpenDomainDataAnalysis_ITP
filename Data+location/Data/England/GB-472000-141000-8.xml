		<title>08HOUSES (FROYLE/HOLYBOURNE)</title>
		<content> Many of the houses in Upper Froyle are
 old and sometimes modernised, but     
 there are also a few modern houses,   
 connected with Treloar College        
 particularly.                         
 A group of houses called{"The         
{Barracks"}were used for prisoners     
 during the Napoleonic Wars.           
 The{Manor House}and{Vicarage}were     
{built in Tudor times}or earlier.      
 Many of the houses are named after the
{statues of saints}on them, which were 
 brought back from Italy by Sir Hubert 
 Miller over fifty years ago.          
 In Holybourne {a Roman town, Vindomis,
 disappeared two thousand years ago but
 gradually since then the present      
 village has grown up around the 'Holy 
 Well' and now new roads of modern     
 houses stand on the old Roman site.
