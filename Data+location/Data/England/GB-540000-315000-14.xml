		<content> Most farmers grow potatoes around     
 here,and the potatoes are sent to     
 Manchester.                           
           Some farmers grow bulbs,    
 like daffodils, and they send the     
 bulbs all over the country to be sold 
 on the markets and in the shops.The   
 daffodils come out about April,and    
 many visitors come to see the fields  
 full of beautiful yellow flowers.Some 
 fields are full of rose bushes,which  
 are sold in garden centres.           
           Farmers used to use Shire   
 horses for farm work, as we use       
 machinery nowadays.Some people keep   
 Shire horses for a hobby and to       
 exhibit at agricultural shows.        
          There are quite a lot of     
 smallholdings which grow horticultural
 produce such as lettuce,tomatoes,     
 cabbage and onions.
