 Below the Queens Parlor and within it 
 lie the Hermitage caves.The Hermitage 
 caves are so called because many years
 ago a religous order used to live in  
 them.The caves are big. In one of the 
 caves there are some steps,there are  
 five steps which end in a drop,the    
 drop is not very great,you can jump   
 down the steps to the floor.The floor 
 is very dirty,it has got a layer of   
 old tin cans and leaves all over it.At
 the back of the caves there is an arch
 which looks like a window filled in   
 but it was a little ledge.This cave   
 was a chapel at one time.The total    
 length of the chapel was just over    
 thirty three feet.The caves are much  
 smaller now than in 1877 because the  
 weather is wearing the soft sandstone 
 away.
