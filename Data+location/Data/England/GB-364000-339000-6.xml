 The estate isn't very old all the     
 houses are 5 years old.The brick work 
 is new and all the road is tarmac even
 the paths are.Across the road from our
 house there is the village green,the  
 hall and bowling green. The estate is 
 clean and quiet but when the boys come
 out it isn't all that quiet.Everybody 
 there is friendly and most of the     
 children are playful there is 1 house 
 for sale. There are 12 houses and 5   
 bungalows and there are 3 different   
 designs of buildings.Seventeen        
 families live on the estate.In our    
 survey we were surprised to find out  
 only one family is local.All the      
 others have moved from towns many     
 miles from Adderley like Manchester,  
 Lowestoft,Bristol,Newcastle upon Tyne 
 and Harlow.                           </content>
