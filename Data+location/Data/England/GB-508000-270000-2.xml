		<title>02THE LANDSCAPE OF WEST CAMBS.</title>
		<content>    Looking across the area, one sees a
 slightly-undulating expanse of arable 
 farmland, with large fields of cereal 
 crops, broken by the occasional hedge 
 and a few small patches of grass and  
 woodland.   Much of the land is       
 accessible only on foot or over rough 
 farm tracks and bridleways.           
                                       
    The area is low-lying, reaching    
 only seventy-seven metres above sea   
 level at Blackwell Manor Farm in the  
 South-West and sloping gently down to 
 thirty metres in the North-East.  The 
 geology consists of Oxford Clay, with 
 deposits of glacial Boulder Clay on   
 higher land in the South-West.        
                                       
    Three small streams drain the area,
 flowing in a north-easterly direction 
 to join Alconbury Brook, a tributary  
 of the Great Ouse.                    </content>
