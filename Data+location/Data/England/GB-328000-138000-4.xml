		<content> The River Parrett is tidal and for    
 hundreds of years man has had to      
 resort to various devices to prevent  
 flooding. The banks of the river have 
 been heightened to contain the river  
 in its course but this is inadequate  
 when tides are abnormal and heavy     
 rains have fallen on the surrounding  
 fields.                               
 To cope with the excess water {CLYCE} 
 systems operate. The pressure of water
 inside the river course at high tide  
 closes a metal hinged flap attached to
 a pipe which in turn is fed into a {  
{rhine }or ditch. Inland flood water is
 contained in this rhine until low tide
 when the pressure of water in the     
 rhine forces open the metal flap and  
 is admitted to the river channel.
