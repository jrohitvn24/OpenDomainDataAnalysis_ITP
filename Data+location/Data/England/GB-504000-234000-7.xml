		<content> Pulloxhill Gold Strike of 1680        
                                       
 This little village might have been a 
 much more important place had not the 
 discovery of gold in 1860 been no more
 than a literal flash in the pan. As   
 all the gold found in the United      
 Kingdom is the property of the Crown, 
 Charles 11 immediately siezed the site
 and it was leased to a firm of        
 refiners. However the gold was no more
 than a few flakes, insufficient to    
 cover refining costs  and was soon    
 abandoned, remembered today only in   
 the local field name of Gold Close.
