		<content> The west part of Brandon has grown    
 rapidly since 1950. Once all farmland,
 now a mixture of council and private  
 estates.Before the colliery closed in 
 1960, the full name of the village was
 Brandon Colliery.An old sawmill gave  
 the name to the large Sawmills Council
 Estate which was built south of the   
 vicarage.The vicarage, no longer used 
 as such but now divided into flats, is
 surrounded by houses.Many people were 
 re-housed in the Sawmills when the old
 colliery houses were demolished in the
 east part of Brandon.The North Eastern
 Co-operative Society built a large    
 food supermarket, opened by T.V.      
 personality Hughie Green in 1974.There
 is a newsagents, hairdressers, bakers 
 and clothes shop in the main shopping 
 area.
