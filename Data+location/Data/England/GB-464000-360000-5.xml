		<title>05ENERGY - OIL IN EAKRING</title>
		<content> The present BP offices stand on the   
 land which together with associated   
 farmland, land in Duke's, Redgate and 
 Pudding Poke Woods was purchased      
 during the sale of the Rufford Abbey  
 Estate in 1934/35 by the D'Arcy       
 Exploration Co. Geophysical survey    
 undertaken in 1937 and an anticline   
 with its culmination under Eakring was
 discovered. The larger Duke's Wood    
 field was discovered later. Between   
 1939-1946 197 wells were drilled, with
 production of around 2,000 barrels a  
 day. Production was phased out during 
 the 1960's and 105 wells abandoned;   
 abandonment of the remainder commenced
 in 1982. Activities are now expanding 
 with personnel around 300. Eakring is 
 the HQ of BP's Land Division, which   
 oversees all onshore operations in    
 Britain, with new offices planned.
