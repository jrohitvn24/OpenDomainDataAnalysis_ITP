 Normally the men go to work.And the   
 ladies work at home to look after the 
 house.The children go to school.The   
 ladies jobs at home are ironing,      
 washing, cooking and hoovering. Mums  
 pick all the things up that you just  
 leave lying around. Your mum does this
 to prevent accidents. Lot's of        
 children have pet's. Your mum cooks   
 your food for your meals.             
  We eat many different types of food. 
 Fresh food is best for you but we also
 have canned and frozen food .Everybody
 enjoys the occasional fish and chips  
 or a Chinese takeaway meal!           
  We are becoming more aware of our    
 diets and are encouraged to eat more  
 fibre, and less additives such as     
 colouring flavourings and             
 preservatives.                        </content>
