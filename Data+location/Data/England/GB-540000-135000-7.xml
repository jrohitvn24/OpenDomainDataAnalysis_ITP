 In the May,1985, County Council       
 elections, the S.D.P. candidate,      
 M.Collins,defeated K.Ball (Tory) in   
 the East Ward, East Grinstead         
 election.The latter had held the seat 
 for 12 years.The local S.D.P.area     
 party has only been formed for 4      
 years.For the recent election they    
 adopted the slogan "Enough is Enough".
 Mrs. Collins found that the main local
 worry was the effect of govt. spending
 cuts. The two main issues were the    
 declining conditions of the roads and 
 pavements and the undermining of      
 standards in education from declining 
 resources-financial and material.     
 Another concern was the lack of choice
 of primary schools for parents.
