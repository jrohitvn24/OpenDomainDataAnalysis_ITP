		<title>01Our Survey Block</title>
		<content>     Our survey block incorporates     
 the villages of{Stow Maries, Purleigh,
{Woodham Ferrers, Cold Norton}and the  
 new town of{South Woodham Ferrers.    
    Much of the land is covered by farm
 properties which have been there for  
 many years. These farms are still     
 farmed by the owners and before that  
 by their fathers and even their       
 grandfathers. This part of the country
 has seen little change.               
  { Stow Maries}is a small village,    
 with no shop and very few houses. The 
 populated area lies either side of the
 main road from{South Woodham Ferrers  
 to{Maldon}or{Burnham-on-Crouch.       
    In great contrast the south of our 
 area comprises  many new closely built
 properties and a factory estate. It is
 the outer extremities  of the new     
 town{South Woodham Ferrers.
