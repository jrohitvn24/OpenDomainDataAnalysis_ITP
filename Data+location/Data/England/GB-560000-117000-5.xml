		<content> Warbleton and District Horticultural  
 and Poultry Society which was formed  
 in 1934 is still a flourishing group  
 although the poultry section was not  
 revived after its wartime ban. The    
 Summer Show, a highlight in the       
 village year, is now held on the      
 village green on the last Saturday of 
 July. A hired marquee is used to stage
 the classes of vegetables, flowers,   
 eggs, cookery and handicrafts for     
 which many silver cups are awarded.   
 Childrens classes include cookery, art
 handicrafts and handwriting. There are
 also competitions for the best kept   
 pets. Displaying and judging takes    
 place in the morning, with the general
 public arriving at 2pm to admire the  
 displays, visit the many side shows   
 and stalls or enjoy a cup of tea and a
 homemade cake. Since 1977 a smaller   
 indoor April Spring show has been held</content>
