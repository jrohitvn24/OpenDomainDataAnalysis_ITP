		<content> Easton farm covers 239 hectares and is
 situated 8 km. south of Grantham.It is
 a rented farm run by Mr. skelton who  
 came to this area in 1955.It is a     
 mixed farm with a large dairy herd    
 (128)on the clay land to the east of  
 the main farm buildings.The herd      
 produces 1850 litres of milk a day.The
 cows calf in September/October, being 
 served by one of four bulls. They are 
 milked twice a day and are fed on     
 silage during the Winter months.This  
 was covered by polythene and had a    
 very strong smell.                    
   The main crops Mr.Skelton grows are 
 winter wheat, oil seed rape and       
 maize.The busiest time of the year is 
 from August to October.In August the  
 crops are harvested by the 5 combine  
 harvestors.Some of the straw is bailed
 most is burnt and winter wheat sown.Mr
 Skelton enjoys farming in this area.  </content>
