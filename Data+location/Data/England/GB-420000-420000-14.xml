		<title>14THE CALDER CANAL - DEWSBURY</title>
		<content> The Calder Canal which runs alongside 
 the River Calder passes through       
 Mirfield and Ravensthorpe. The canal, 
 first owned by the Aire and Calder    
 Navigation Company and then by the    
 Calder and Hebble Navigation Company, 
 was{nationalised}in 1948.             
 It's main use in past years was for   
 transporting {coal}from local pits to 
 the recently closed Thornhill power   
 station and to nearby gas and chemical
 works. Nowadays, the canal is rarely  
 used for industrial purposes and is   
 far cleaner as local mills no longer  
 pollute it and {British Waterways}has 
 spent a great deal of money cleaning  
 it. It is mainly used by holidaymakers
 for {cruising}and for educational     
 trips by local schools utilising the  
{'Calder Lady'}which takes children    
 through locks, past old mills and into
 the countryside.                      </content>
