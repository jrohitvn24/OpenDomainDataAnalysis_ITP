		<title>09GAMES IN THE PLAYGROUND - 2</title>
		<content> These are "on it", "he", "catch" and  
 "tay".  Any number can play.  One     
 child is "on it".  This child has to  
 chase and catch another child who then
 becomes "on it" instead.              
{What's the Time Mr. Wolf} One child   
 "the wolf" stands facing a wall.  The 
 other children form a line facing him.
 They gradually advance towards him    
 saying "what's the time Mr. Wolf?.    
 The Wolf answers 1 o'clock.    Then   
 the same happens again.  Each time the
 children ask the time, they can step  
 one step closer to him.  When the Wolf
 thinks they are near enough he shouts 
 "supper time" and catches as many     
 children as possible.  The wolf must  
 make sure that no one gets to the wall
 or he is out.
