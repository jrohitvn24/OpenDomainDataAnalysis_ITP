		<content>{Tom Cobbley:}                         
            Tom Cobbley has lived in   
 Coalville for twenty years. Over these
 years children's manners have changed,
 nowadays children do and say what they
 like;"corporal punishment should      
 still be used," says Tom.  Tom thinks 
 there should be more entertainment in 
 Coalville to keep young people off the
 streets.                              
{Mr. Armson:}                          
            Mr. Armson has lived in    
 Coalville for thirty years. He started
 work down{South Leicester}pit when he 
 was fourteen, he worked there for     
 fifty two years. Around our school,   
 there used to be no houses, just      
 fields. There is enough entertainment 
 in Coalville, but unfortunately some  
 of the youngsters abuse it. If there  
 was a major disaster, he said people  
 wouldn't help as they are too proud.  </content>
