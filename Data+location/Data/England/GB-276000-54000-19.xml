		<content> Our school has got two{BBC micro-     
{computers.} One belongs to the school 
 and was bought through a Department of
 Industry scheme, the other belongs to 
 Mr Peach.                             
                                       
 We do all sorts of work on the micro  
 computer.  My favourite is an exciting
 adventure game where you have to      
 explore an unknown world.             
                                       
 The school has just brought a{word-   
{processor and printer}and now we write
 and print a lot of things using the   
 computer.                             
                                       
 Several children have got their own   
 computers at home and they seem to be 
 getting very popular.  I have got an  
 Acorn Electron. I was given it for    
 Christmas.
