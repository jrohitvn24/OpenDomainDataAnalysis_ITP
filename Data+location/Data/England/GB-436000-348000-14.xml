		<title>14FAMILY FUN DAY.RIPLEY.</title>
		<content> I went to the family fun day on June  
 9th at Crossley Park Ripley.The Family
 Fun Day was organised by the          
 East Midlands Co-op.The weather was   
 variable some rain ,some sun and a    
 cold breeze.My first impressions was  
 that it looked busy and exciting      
 rather like a carnival.There were 4   
 tents and several stalls and lots of  
 people with hot dogs and drinks.From  
 the stalls I bought two games, a box  
 of soldiers and a few books.In the    
 arena I saw Roy Rivers a unicyclist.He
 dressed as a policeman and rode his   
 unicycle round the arena with the     
 siren on top of his helmet flashing.  
 Then he picked 2 boys and 2 girls from
 the crowd and they rode his Penny     
 farthing.Also in the arena were       
 sheepdog trials,2 bands and karate,   
 judo,keep-fit,and gym demonstrations. 
 The last fun day was in the late 1950s</content>
