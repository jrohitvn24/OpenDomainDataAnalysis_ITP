		<content>{Skipsea}is a coastal village which is 
 threatened by erosion losing quite a  
 large amount of land each year.There  
 is a mound on the site of a Norman    
 motte and bailey castle, first  built 
 by Dru de la Beuvriere. Stones from   
 the ruin were used in building the    
 church. There are various campsites   
 and a few shops, and farms which are  
 mostly arable ,but some also breed    
 amimals and have milk herds.          
 The church runs a Sunday school and   
 there is also a chapel.The school     
 serves five villages and cubs meet    
 there once a week. There is also a    
 youth club a village hall and village 
 green and play area.                  
 The sea has claimed many bungalows.   
 There used to be a village called     
 Cleeton but it has now been destroyed 
 by the sea.
