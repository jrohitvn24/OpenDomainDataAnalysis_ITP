		<title>03ECOLOGY OF THE TADLEY AREA</title>
		<content> The influence of geology on ecology   
 and landuse in the Tadley area is very
 marked and  has led to the quite      
 distinct division of rural and urban  
 areas. The London CLay and Alluvial   
 gravels have been largely converted to
 intensive agricultural systems. On the
 Bagshot Beds woodland high forest,    
 mainly of oaks with alder in the      
 wetter patches, has developed, some of
 these area have been put into timber  
 production. On the Plateau gravels    
 good examples of heathland with       
 typical plant and animal communities  
 are regarded as poor agricultural land
 and have been allowed to become light 
 industrial and housing land, although 
 some areas of common land remain.     
 Gravel extraction has been a major    
 feature of the area, but at present   
 there is very little within the survey
 area.                                 </content>
