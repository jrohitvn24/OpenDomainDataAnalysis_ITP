		<title>04HOUSING IN THORNABY</title>
		<content> Most of the houses in the northern    
 part of{Thornaby}were built over a 100
 years ago. They are terraced houses   
 and do not have gardens. When they    
 were built they did not have bathrooms
 but many of them had bathrooms built  
 on to them. Some of them have been    
 demolished because they were not      
 suitable for large families. Many     
 people who used to live in these      
 houses are now living in modern houses
 on the old{airfield site}in the south 
 of the town.                          
    The houses in the centre of{       
{Thornaby}are nearly all semi-detached 
 houses.They have front and back       
 gardens,and they all have bathrooms.  
 Some of these houses are owned by the 
 Borough Council and the families pay  
 rent for them.Other houses are owned  
 by the families who live in them.
