 Our pit is called a drift mine.The men
 go underground in little trains. 540  
 people work at the pit in three       
 shifts.Days 6am to 2:30pm.Afters 12   
 noon to 8:30pm and nights 10pm to 6:30
 am.The seams go along underground for 
 about a mile.When the pit closes,in   
 about 4 years,we would like the land  
 to be used for a leisure centre or    
 something like that.                  
 FARM LAND                             
 The colliery and the village are      
 surrounded by farm land.Most of the   
 land belongs to 2 farmers.They both   
 keep beef cattle.They also grow the   
 straw and corn needed for their       
 animals.Mr Elliot has a farm shop     
 where he sells meat.
