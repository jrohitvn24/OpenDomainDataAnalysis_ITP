		<title>11Friston Forest Snap Hill</title>
		<content> Snap Hill is part of a chalk ridge    
 which extends approximately north to  
 south for 2 km with the village of    
 Jevington below its north-eastern     
 edge.A tan race-track extends straight
 along the ridge for the training of   
 the Jevington stabled race horses.    
 Every morning they are brought up from
 the stables for exercise and sometimes
 the trainer is seen timing them over a
 measured distance.There are starting  
 stalls with which the horses learn to 
 become familiar.On an August          
 morning,two horses were being timed   
 and one of them next day came second  
 in its race at Folkestone at 33-1.The 
 ridge is usually deserted except for a
 few walkers,but in blackberry time    
 more people are seen,picking the fruit
 for home-made jam.Sloes are gathered  
 later in the autumn for jam or        
 sloe-gin.                             </content>
