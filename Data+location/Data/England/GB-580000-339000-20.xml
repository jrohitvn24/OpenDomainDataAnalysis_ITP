		<title>20BURNHAM MARKET - THE FUTURE</title>
		<content>    Burnham Market has changed         
 gradually, but this still remains an  
 agricultural area, as it has been for 
 many centuries. The past 40 years have
 seen much new building, especially    
 within this survey area, and have seen
 a shift in the population structure of
 the village, with many more retired   
 people living here and many more      
 tourists visiting. If plans for major 
 estate development in the area succeed
 this village will change dramatically:
 in the next century Burnham Market    
 might not be the village of beauty and
 charm which it is at present.
