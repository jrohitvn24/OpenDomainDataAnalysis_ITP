 unit.  Further along by Coach Road is 
 the Old School which closed in 1967.  
 This is now a private house.  Opposite
 this is Clay Lane where the new school
 has been since 1967.  Nearby are      
 houses and bungalows, a village pond, 
 an old peoples rest home, the Church  
 and Rectory.  There are houses along  
 the A27 and also a garage.  Behind    
 most of the houses in the village are 
 arable fields.(by Jacob Pope).        
{MAUDLIN}As the A27 leaves Westhampnett
 it enters Maudlin.  At Maudlin there  
 is a row of houses on the main road,  
 an Inn called the Coach &amp; Horses, and 
 a Garage.  The road forks at Maudlin, 
 one the A27 to Arundel the other the  
 A285 leads to Petworth.  There is     
 often a queue of waiting cars here    
 especially in the summer.             </content>
