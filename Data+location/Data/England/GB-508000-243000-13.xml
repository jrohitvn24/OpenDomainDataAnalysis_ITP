		<content> In the Autumn many of the fields have 
 been ploughed after harvesting. Among 
 the crops grownare Winter Wheat,      
 Oilseed Rape,Winter Barley, Spring    
 Beans, Lucerne and Maize. Some fields 
 are laid to grass and sheep and cows  
 may be seen grazing here. A mixed     
 variety of fruit and vegetables       
 including sweetcorn and pumpkins may  
 be found at the "pick your own" Farm  
 on the A600 Bedford to Hitchin road.  
 Most of the woodlandis part of the    
 Samuel Whitbread Estate. The mature   
 timber is mainly blocks of amenity    
 trees with most of the plantation     
 having been replanted within the last 
 thirty years. Mechanical, hand or     
 spray weeding is used to clear the    
 young plantations. All the timber from
 the woodland is sold to Southill Saw  
 Mills which produce a wide variety of 
 fencing material.                     </content>
