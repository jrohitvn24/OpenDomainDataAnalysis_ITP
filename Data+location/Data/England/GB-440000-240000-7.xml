		<title>07Community Policeman</title>
		<content>The Bretch Hill Estate has a community 
policeman it is his job to try and     
prevent crime. He tries to do this by  
visting  schools, youth clubs, and     
other community groups. He also helps  
to run an after school club. When on   
duty his time is spent riding and      
walking around the estate or dealing   
with its problems, except on the few   
occasions when he is needed elsewhere. 
He believes that prevention is the best
cure for crime and so he likes to be   
seen on the streets and doing regular  
visits to places when they are empty,  
to check that all is well eg. schools. 
By being seen he hopes there will be   
less problems. Getting to know people  
helps him to be aware of what's going  
on in the area. Most people react well 
to his presence especially the         
pensioners. The 15 to 25 age group     
resent him most.                       </content>
