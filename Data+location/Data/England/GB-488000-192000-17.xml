		<title>17Infant Playground Games</title>
		<content> At playtime we play the playground    
 games which are fun. I like playing   
{show jumping.}There are yellow bars   
 painted on the ground and we pretend  
 to have a horse and jump over the     
 painted bars.There are also{mazes}and 
{train tracks}painted on the           
 playground.We also play a catching    
 game called{Polo}which is played      
 between two walls and you have to     
 touch the walls five times before you 
 are caught.                           
 The favourite game in the summer is   
{Elastics.}You need at least three     
 people to play.Two people have a ring 
 of elastic around their legs and the  
 others have to jump in and over,      
 catching and twisting the elastic with
 their feet.We play{'Granny's Knickers'
{'Big Ben' and'England}Ireland'.There  
 are rhymes to say while you jump.
