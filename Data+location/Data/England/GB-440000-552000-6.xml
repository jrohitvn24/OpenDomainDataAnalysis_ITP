		<title>06Changing Times in Ryhope</title>
		<content>    We  were interested in how{Ryhope  
 had changed since our parents and     
 grandparents were young. When we asked
 how Ryhope had changed most people    
 remembered the pit and how Ryhope was 
 much smaller, quieter and there were a
 lot more open spaces. Most people     
 worked at the{Ryhope Pit,}the         
{Co-operative store}or{Cherry Knowle   
{Hospital.                             
                                       
    When our parents and grandparents  
 were young many of their games were   
 played in the street. Many children   
 today seem to spend a great deal of   
 their free time watching television or
 playing computer games. Some children 
 do play games in the street but have  
 to be careful of traffic and parked   
 cars.
