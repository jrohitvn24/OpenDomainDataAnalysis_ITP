		<title>07HOLY TRINITY CHURCH PRIVETT</title>
		<content> This Church was built in 1876 on the  
 site of a Church dated, it is         
 believed,1391. The 160 ft spire is a  
 landmark for miles around. The main   
 fabric is of flint, brick and stone   
 and its lofty roof supported by       
 moulded pine beams reaches 52 ft from 
 floor to ridge. Inside are fine       
 columns of marble and stone, a        
 magnificent carved stone reredos and  
 pulpit and the altar with its ornate  
 mosaic floor is approached by seven   
 steps of black Belgian marble. Built  
 by the principal landowner,this Church
 was intended to serve the family and  
 retainers of the estate.When the      
 family moved away the 150 parishioners
 were left with the task of maintaining
 it.Heating costs alone were exorbitant
 and in the 1960's when extensive      
 repairs to the roof became urgent the 
 parish approached the Diocese.        </content>
