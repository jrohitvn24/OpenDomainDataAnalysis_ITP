		<content>  Charles Garland, who had{Moreton Hall
 built in 1905, was the son of the     
 founder of "The First Natioal Bank of 
 America". He decided upon the life of 
 a typical'English Country Gentleman'. 
 Unable to find a suitable country seat
 he had it built at a cost of Â£250,000.
 It included stables and woods and     
 gardens that needed 30 gardeners.His  
 sister decided she would like a house.
 Another was erected 1 mile to the     
 south at Moreton Paddox. This house   
 has been demolished though some of the
 smaller features are to be found as   
 parts of the modern houses built on   
 the site.These houses are currently   
 valued at over Â£120,000.              
 The Hall was sold in the 1920's for   
 Â£34,000. During World War 2 it became 
 headquarters for the Free Czech. Army 
 and American Troops. Warwickshire C.C.
 bought the house in 1948 for Â£55,000. </content>
