		<title>10Houses in our block</title>
		<content> The houses in our block vary in age.  
 In the centre of Worle there is a very
 old cottage called the Round House    
 which used to be a toll house.There is
 also an old house called Maywood House
 which is going to be demolished.Old   
 Victorian houses were large because   
 they housed big families and servants.
 They were made out of stones from the 
 local quarry.They had a lot of        
 chimneys because all the bedrooms had 
 fireplaces.Now modern houses are      
 being built in some old houses'       
 gardens and they are smaller.Sometimes
 the large houses are turned into old  
 peoples homes or flats.Some houses are
 about 50 years old and are semi-      
 detached.In the last 20 years many new
 houses have been built. In the area of
 North Worle nearly all of the houses  
 are modern apart from a few old farm  
 buildings.                            </content>
