		<title>02PEOPLE IN WOORE</title>
		<content> The population of Woore has risen     
 during the past five years because of 
 a{housing development}on Westfields   
 behind St. Leonard's Church.          
 In 26 families; 13 fathers were not   
 born locally, 5 were born in the      
 Potteries, 8 were born locally and 2  
 in Woore itself,- 16 mothers were not 
 born locally, 4 were born in Woore.   
 There is a good mixture of ages in the
 village because there are two small   
 groups of bungalows for{old people}and
 an Old People's Home at Bulkeley Hall,
 people have been settled for some     
 years in the{older houses,}and{younger
{families}have moved into the newly-   
 built houses.{                        
 Our survey showed that 16 fathers had 
 degree or "professional qualification"
 and that 15 mothers had degree or     
 "professional qualificaion".  Only 6  
 families were involved with farming.  </content>
