		<content> School starts at 8.55 when a bell     
 rings to tell us to take our coats and
 bags in and report to our classrooms. 
                                       
 Mr Peach takes the{register}and       
 collects the dinner money and then    
 another bell tells us that it is time 
 for{assembly.} We have an assembly    
 every morning.  Usually we have a     
 story, sing some hymns and say a few  
 prayers.                              
                                       
 After assembly, which the whole school
 attends, we return to our classrooms  
 and{lessons}begin.  In the morning we 
 usually do language work and maths.   
 We work on our own or in groups.  My  
 favourite lesson is maths, but a lot  
 of the other children don't like it   
 much.
