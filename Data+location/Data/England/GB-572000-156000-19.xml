		<content> the area. It was also found that the  
 alkalinity of the soil varied within  
 each geological type as well as within
 areas covered by the same land use.   
 For example:{Hythe Beds}had a pH of   
 between 6 and 8, the{Folkestone Beds} 
 had a pH of between 6 and 9 and{Head }
 deposits a pH of 9.5.                 
 A wheat field at 759585 on Gault Clay 
 gave two readings of pH8.5 and 9. The 
 choice of crop grown also seems to    
 affect/be affected by the pH values:  
 e.g. At 749584, Grassland, pH6.0      
      At 759585, Wheat, pH 8.5         
      At 729562, Orchard, pH8.0        
{Intensive methods}allow a decreasing  
 dependency on existing soil type and  
 an increased use of artificial        
 fertilizers.pH readings often reflect 
 farmers additions,so the above should 
 be read with care!
