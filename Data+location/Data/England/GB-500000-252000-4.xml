		<title>04Adult leisure in Clapham</title>
		<content> In Clapham there are lots of          
 occupations for adults but the main   
 things are the pubs and clubs         
 including The Fox and Hounds The Star,
 The Swan, The Horse and Groom and The 
 Clapham Club.   People usually go on  
 disco nights but some go for the bingo
 and games.   Some people go horse     
 riding at Tinsley's School of Horse   
 Riding.   Adults go at a different    
 time from the children, but they      
 must get there on time.   We have a   
 few children's occupations,           
 including judo, Brownies, Cubs and    
 Clapham Park.   At Clapham Club       
 there is bingo for the ladies and     
 snooker, darts and skittles for the   
 men.   Every year the club has a      
 trip to Great Yarmouth by coach.      
 They leave in the morning and come    
 back at night.
