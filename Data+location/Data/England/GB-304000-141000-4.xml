 which is now{Liddymore Road.          
      She left school in{1929}after 9  
 years. Edna didn't have then any      
 electricity and therefore no record   
 players, washing machines, cars were  
 too expensive. Water came from a tap  
 in the kitchen. There was no bathroom

 a tin tub.                            
      For{games}she played snakes and  
 ladders or drew.
