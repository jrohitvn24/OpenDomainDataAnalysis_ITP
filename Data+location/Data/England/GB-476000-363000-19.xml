		<title>19Sutton on Trent</title>
		<content> Sutton on Trent is a pleasant little  
 village in the Trent Valley.It lies   
 between the A.1.(Old Great North Road)
 to the West and the River Trent to the
 East.There have been many prehistoric 
 finds dredged from the river at this  
 point,including fossilized mammoth's  
 teeth and tusks. Roman and Anglo Saxon
 pottery have also been unearthed.There
 is a fine medieval church.The village 
 site would seem to be an ancient      
 one,based on an old river crossing,a  
 ferry to the now extinct village of   
 Meering,(in Sutton Parish).The farms  
 and cottages range in age from 300    
 year old timber cottages to present   
 day developments.A disused tower mill 
 dominates Main St.to the South.The    
  Council are in favour of moderate    
 development and light industry is     
 encouraged to the village.Sutton      
 remains a living,working village.     </content>
