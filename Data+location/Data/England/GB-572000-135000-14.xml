		<title>14Hops Harvesting.</title>
		<content>The fields in which hops are cultivated
are called hop-gardens. They are grown 
up ropes on to a wire support and hop  
training is still a job that has to be 
done by hand, encouraging the young    
shoots to climb the ropes. At harvest  
time the vines are cut down from the   
top. This used to be done by men on    
stilts but they use a motorised lift.  
The old method of harvesting was all by
hand so many extra labourers were      
needed. This provided a working annual 
holiday for families otherwise unable  
to afford such luxury. With the        
development of hop picking machines the
few helpers now needed are mostly      
university students earning holiday    
money.
