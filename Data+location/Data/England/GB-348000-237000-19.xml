		<title>19A Hereford School Pantomime.</title>
		<content>{                                      
   Our school pantomime was{"Ali Baba  
{and the 40 Thieves"}(well, only 5     
 thieves really.) We performed it on   
 the  12th and 13th February,1985.     
   The{first night}went wrong a little.
 I was the cleaning Genie and I dropped
 the beads! Everybody laughed. The     
 second night went well, I was feeling 
 ill but I still acted well.           
   We had a{collection}after every     
 performance. The money was for the    
 N.S.P.C.C. which means the National   
 Society for the Prevention of Cruelty 
 to Children. We raised just over one  
 hundred pounds.                       
   The pantomime was a great success   
 and we all enjoyed ourselves.
