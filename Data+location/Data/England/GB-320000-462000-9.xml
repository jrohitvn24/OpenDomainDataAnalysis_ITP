		<content> Observation hides have been placed    
 around the site to watch the many     
 birds.                                
 To keep the sanctuary open,money is   
 needed.Funds are received from        
 subscriptions from the members of the 
 Naturalists Trust,donations from      
 visitors to the sanctuary and         
 Government grants.                    
 There are three trails that visitors  
 can follow:the blue trail covers a    
 distance of 2miles and goes to the    
 Oyster Farm and back.The red trail    
 covers 3miles and goes past the Oyster
 Farm and Walney Lighthouse.The green  
 trail is just an extension of the red 
 one and leads to an area that is just 
 for nesting birds,usually ducks like  
 Eider,Mallard and Shelduck.
