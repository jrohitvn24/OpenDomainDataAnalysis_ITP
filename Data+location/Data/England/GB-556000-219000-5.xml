		<title>05TAKELEY, THE INDUSTRY</title>
		<content> The technological age has not passed  
 Takeley by.  The largest single       
 employer in the village is Neotronics,
 manufacturers of environmental        
 protection instrumentation and energy 
 conservation equipment.  The firm,    
 established in 1973, now employs 160  
 people and intends to expand in 1985. 
 Another employer is Barkers who       
 manufacture large oil tanks.  This    
 firm, situated in the centre of the   
 village, will soon move away to make  
 room for further housing development. 
 Other employers are small, having only
 a few employees.  These include crash 
 repair specialists, caravan sales and 
 service, and gravel extraction which  
 has started at Little Canfield.       
 However, agriculture is the largest   
 industry in the area.
