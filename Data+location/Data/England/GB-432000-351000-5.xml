		<title>05The Mineral Railroad</title>
		<content> In 1840 George Stephenson came to the 
 village to arrange for quarrying      
 stone, and also to plan a railway.The 
 railroad was built and it carried     
 limestone from Cliff Quarry to the    
 limekilns at Ambergate. Stephenson had
 to find a way of getting the trucks up
 and down a steep incline, so he made a
 drum to pull and push the trucks by   
 pushing a lever that in 1948 was      
 replaced by an electric motor. The    
 incline was known as'the steep' which 
 was one of the steepest hills in the  
 country. In 1957 the railway was      
 closed.
