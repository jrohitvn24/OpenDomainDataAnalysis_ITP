		<title>01THE REDHILL AREA</title>
		<content>{REDHILL}lies at the foot of the{SCARP 
{SLOPE}of the{NORTH DOWNS}in a{CLAY    
{VALE. }To the south of the town is a{ 
{SANDSTONE RIDGE.}This complex geology 
 has benefitted several{EXTRACTIVE     
{INDUSTRIES}which are located here.    
{REDHILL }developed mainly as a result 
 of the coming of the RAILWAY.  The    
 town lies at the junction of the main 
 NORTH/SOUTH, EAST/WEST lines.  In the 
 19th century many railway workers     
 lived in the town.  It later grew into
 a{MARKET TOWN}and finally into a{     
{COMMUTER DORMITORY TOWN}              
                                       
 REDHILL has successfully attracted new
 offices and factories to the area.    
 This has increased local employment so
 reducing it's dormitory function.  The
 new{QUADRANT SHOPPING CENTRE}will also
 increase the towns importance as a    
 market centre.                        </content>
