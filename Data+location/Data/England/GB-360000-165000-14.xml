		<title>14My Clothes</title>
		<content> My name is Neil Winterson.I am ten    
 years of age and attend Perry         
 Court Junior  School. When I go to    
 school I wear grey or blue trousers   
 and a blue shirt.My shirt is 65%      
 polyester and 35% cotton.My socks are 
 cotton and I generally wear trainer   
 shoes.I do not like wearing uniform   
 because I sit by a sunny window in    
 class and I perspire but it is not too
 bad when I have got on a short-sleeved
 shirt.My favourite clothes are jeans  
 (they are a kind of denim trouser),a  
 t-shirt and some old trainers.        
 Sometimes I wear my  newer jeans on   
 Sunday for Sunday best.Most of my     
 friends wear jeans because the latest 
 fashion is jeans.I have quite a lot of
 different sorts of jeans.I would like 
 to wear jeans to school.
