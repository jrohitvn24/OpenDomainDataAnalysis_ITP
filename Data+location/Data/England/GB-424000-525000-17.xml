		<title>17WOODHAM VILLAGE SHOP.</title>
		<content> The shop at Woodham Village opened on 
 14th February 1985. It is in Morrison 
 Close. It sells daily newspapers,     
 magazines, comics, confectionary,     
 tobacco, alcohol, ice cream and all   
 sorts of other things. It opens from  
 6.30am. until 8.00pm. with an hour    
 closing for lunch at 1.00pm. It even  
 opens on Sundays from 8.00 until      
 midday. Six part-time staff work      
 there. They are all female, four are  
 married, three with families. The     
 other two are 17 and 18 years of age. 
 the youngest is going to take up a    
 post in the army. It is useful to have
 a small local shop because if you     
 forget something when you do your main
 shopping in the large supermarket, or 
 if you suddenly run out of something, 
 you can just go round the corner to   
 buy it and then go back round the     
 corner home.                          </content>
