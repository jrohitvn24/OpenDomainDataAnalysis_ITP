		<content> The British Legion with its premises  
 in the High Street is both a welfare  
 and a social club. Its main task is to
 look after the needs of ex-Servicemen 
 of two World wars and their dependants
 The Branch keeps a careful watch on   
 those in need and does a great deal of
 effective welfare work. The social    
 side of the club is very popular. The 
 clubhouse is well equipped and has two
 snooker tables,a pool table and       
 bowling alley.                        
 The Scouts and Guides together with   
 their junior branches the Cubs and    
 Brownies have a thriving following in 
 the area. The Scouts meet at St       
 Catharine's and the Guides at the     
 Youth Club, Centre 65. At present the 
 Scouts and Guides are busily raising  
 money to build themselves a Clubhouse.
 Centre 65 is the Youth Club on the    
 campus of Campden School.             </content>
