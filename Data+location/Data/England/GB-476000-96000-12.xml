 is used for growing crops but some    
 livestock is kept.

 Nunnington Farm is Mr.Broadbridge and 
 his family live in the farm house.He  
 farms 175 acres of land in this block.
 He uses a variety of mechanised       
 equipment,including a JCB,six tractors
 and a combine harvester.They grow     
 horse beans,barley oats,corn and wheat
 and some fields are left as grass for 
 the sheep.At present there are no     
 livestock on the farm but             
 Mr.Broadbridge hopes to reintroduce

 and hay for the Winter months.
