		<title>07BROOK BANK FARM</title>
		<content> (Continued) The best sort of breed are
 Friesians. Dad keeps 4 horses and 40  
 beef stock. There is about 70 head of 
 stock sold for slaughtering each year.
 The most common diseases on the farm  
 are mastitas and e-coli. The best sort
 of food for cows is grass. The milk is
 taken to a Milk Marketing Board depot.
 Since the milk quota came in, Dad can 
 not make more money than the quota    
 allows. An average buying price for a 
 milking cow is Â£550. It takes 3 hours 
 per day to milk. There are other jobs 
 on the farm like cleaning yards and   
 the parlour, land cultivation and     
 fertilising. The future for dairy     
 farmers is very uncertain. Dad enjoys 
 being a farmer but only when things   
 are going well (Which is very         
 uncertain).
