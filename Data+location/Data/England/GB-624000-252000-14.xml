		<content>     There are several ponds on farms  
and in gardens in the area. In and     
around them there are pond snails,     
water insects, frogs, toads, newts,    
ducks and flying insects like          
dragonflies.                           
     In the fields there are field     
mice, hares, rabbits, lizards, moles,  
shrews, voles, grass snakes, stoats    
and weasels.                           
     Deer can sometimes be seen grazing
as they move from one wood to another. 
     Though foxes are rarely seen signs
of them can be found in ditches and    
woods, where there are also red and    
grey squirrels.                        
     Hedgehogs are seen mainly when    
they have been run over on the road.   
     At dusk bats fly around.
