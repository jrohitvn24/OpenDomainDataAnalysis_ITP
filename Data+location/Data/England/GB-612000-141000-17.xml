		<title>17Lyminge Forest</title>
		<content> Lyminge Forest is a forest on the way 
 to Canterbury. A few different woods  
 make up Lyminge Forest. Most of the   
 trees are fir trees. Lots of sponsored
 walks and nature trails are held      
 there. In 1984 Lyminge School held a  
 sponsored walk there. It is about 2\  
 miles away from Lyminge. The forest is
 joined on to Round Down Wood and      
 Stowting Rough. There are several     
 reservoirs in case of fire. There is  
 lots of wild life in Lyminge Forest.  
 There are quite a few deciduous trees.
 Fir trees have very long thin leaves  
 that we call needles. They are        
 coniferous and have pine cones on     
 them. The animals in Lyminge Forest   
 are rabbits, adders, badgers, foxes,  
 and grey squirrels. Lyminge Forest is 
 guarded by the Forestry Commission and
 has a road running by it.
