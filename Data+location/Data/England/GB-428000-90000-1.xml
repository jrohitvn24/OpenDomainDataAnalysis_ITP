 Our village (meaning Milford on Sea)  
 is noisy and busy.                    
         Milford on Sea is one of the  
 last sea side villages along the south
 coast.The council say they can't build
 anything else.Not many tourists visit 
 this village ,apart from the two      
 caravan sites that this village holds.
          The houses are mainly        
 modern, apart from some which         
 were seventeenth century.             
           Walking from the busy roads 
 into the country lanes is just like   
 walking through a sound barrier.The   
 back lanes of Milford show you what   
 the coutry is really like.            
           The people are friendly.
