		<content> I get up always at 7.00am.            
 At 8.00 I go and have my bacon        
 sandwich then I clean my teeth and    
 I go to school and line up to go in.  
 When we go in we usually do some      
 number work together and              
 have a story.First                    
 play is at 10.30am and I play         
 FORTY_FORTY.It is a game_a person is  
 IT and he counts to forty and the rest
 hide and save themselves and the last 
 person can all.                       
 Lunch time is at 12.00.               
 Afternoon school starts at 1.15pm.Then
 we usually do P.E. Last play is at    
 2.30pm,then at 3.35pm we go home.     
 After tea I sit in front of the       
 television and I go to bed at 9.00pm.
