 Ian is a Chaddesden teenager. He left 
 school with 5 O levels and followed a 
 Youth Training Scheme (Y.T.S.) as a   
 mechanic. He doesn't recommend this   
 scheme as the key to a job. He gets   
 Â£18.45 a week on the dole. He spends  
 about three hours a week looking for a
 job through the{Job Centre}adverts and
 the local newspaper. He passes the    
 time at unemployment clubs and playing
 football.                             
                                       
{Employed teenager:}                   
 Paul left school at 17 with 7 C.S.E.  
 exams passes. He got a job as a       
 trainee accountant. He was not very   
 enthusiastic about the Y.T.S. policy. 
 He like to play football and badminton
 and still goes to the youth club. He  
 has enough money to buy a drink at    
 night and buy clothes.                </content>
