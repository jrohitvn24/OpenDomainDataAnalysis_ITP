		<content>  My name is Claire Morgan,I live at   
 the College of Agriculture.My Dad is  
 the foreman of the horticultural      
 department.Our house comes with Dad's 
 job and is one of the oldest houses at
 the College.                          
  We have an Open Day at the College   
 each year(in June),there are lots of  
 different things to see like sheep    
 shearing, sheepdog trials,tractor     
 rides,watching the cows being milked  
 and rural crafts.                     
  About a week before the Open Day I   
 help Dad get ready.I weed around the  
 bog garden and the O-field (the       
 O-field is a piece of grassland shaped
 in an O which has two lakes and       
 various plants and shrubs in).Then we 
 do some watering in the greenhouses.We
 get the tomatoes,cucumbers and flowers
 ready for selling on Open Day.
