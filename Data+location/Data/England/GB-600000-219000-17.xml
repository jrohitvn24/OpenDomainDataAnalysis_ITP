      Rowhedge, Fingringhoe, and       
 Abberton all have playing fields but  
 the Rowhedge Rec is large enough for  
 minor league football, enabling the   
 Rowhehge Albion team to play in the   
 Sunday league.                        
      The children can take part in    
 Cubs, Brownies, Scouts,football Club, 
 Sunday School, and Thursday Club. For 
 teenagers the are Youth Clubs in both 
 Rowhedge &amp; Fingringhoe but these only 
 open two nights a week.               
      An old gravel workings behind    
 Rowhedge - the pits is ideal for      
 fishing and childrens adventure games.
 The river plays a most important role 
 and there are yatch moorings and the  
 Rowhedge Sailing Club with over 70    
 members
