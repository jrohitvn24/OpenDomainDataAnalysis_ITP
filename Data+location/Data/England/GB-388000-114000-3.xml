		<content>    The parish boundary around Fontmell
 Magna was first written down in a     
 charter of c.888 AD and has remained  
 little changed today. Many landmarks  
 cited then exiist now including       
 boundaries, copses and barrows. One   
 such copse is "Sutton Clump" at the   
 top of Sutton Hill.                   
    Iron Age cross dykes believed to   
 mark cattle/farm boundaries are found 
 in the woods. From medieval times     
 there remains terracing known as strip
 lynchetts - locally as "lanches".     
    Today many field boundaries remain 
 from the various periods of enclosure 
 and the hedges have a diversity of    
 natural life. In the exppansion of    
 mechanised agriculture in the past 3  
 decades some hedges have gone and the 
 increased use of chemicals has reduced
 the flora in others.
