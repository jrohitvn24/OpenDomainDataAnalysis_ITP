		<title>01Oulton and Woodlesford.</title>
		<content> Oulton and Woodlesford were formerly 2
 villages which have merged together   
 over the years.It is hard to decide   
 where one begins and one ends.Once    
 there was a lot of work in this area _
 coal mines,quarries,a brickyard,a     
 sawmill and a brewery.Now all of these
 are closed down.There is a lot of     
{waste land}broken up by farmers {     
{fields}growing things like peas,wheat 
 and barley.Now most of the people work
 in Leeds or Wakefield.The jobs in     
 Woodlesford/Oulton are mainly in the  
 service industries _ like dinner      
 ladies,cleaners and shop assistants.We
 also have a {sports centre}close      
 by.The{Aire and Caulder canal}passes  
 through Woodlesford,as well as the {  
{London/Glasgow railway.}The {M.62.}is 
 less than 2 miles away.
