		<title>16Poplars  Farm Visit 1</title>
		<content> We arrived at the farm and played with
 the family kitten Tiptoes.We then     
 started the tour of the farm.The farm 
 has poultry and so the first place    
 that we visited was the room where the
 eggs are sorted.The eggs are put onto 
 cotton reel like rollers,that have a  
 light underneath called the candle.It 
 allows you to see if the eggs have any
 cracks.This is called Candling.They   
 are then passed onto teeth like things
 which move along slopes and the teeth 
 let go of the eggs at whichever slope 
 is their size.They are then packed    
 into boxes.Then we saw some Fresian   
 cows,there were 26.After that we went 
 to see some chickens.We saw the fruit 
 growing in the tunnels and we all had 
 a strawberry. Blackberries, rasberies,
 blackcurrants and tayberries are other
 fruit grown.Mange-tout beans, french  
  beans and wheat are also grown.      </content>
