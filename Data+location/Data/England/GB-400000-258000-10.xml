		<title>10RECREATION - HOLBERROW GREEN</title>
		<content> Charity work for the disabled forms   
 the only recreation for one couple who
 have adapted both their home and      
 garden for ease of access for         
 approximately 5000 visitors per year. 
 These two people never have a holiday 
 as their one acre garden requires     
 constant attention as well as the many
 avaries and birds they look after.    
                                       
 Apart from walking and gardening all  
 other recreational activities take    
 place outside the area. Squash,       
 badminton, swimming, football and     
 tennis are enjoyed. The facilities for
 these are to be found in both the     
 nearby village of Inkberrow and       
 further afield in Redditch and        
 surrounding large towns.              
                                       
 The farming families  have little time
 to take part in recreation.           </content>
