		<title>12ECOLOGY - HEDGEROWS</title>
		<content> THE{HEDGEROWS}OF THIS AREA ARE VERY   
  ABUNDANT BUT NOT AS ABUNDANT AS THEY 
 USED TO BE. FARMERS AROUND THE AREA   
 HAVE THINNED OUT MOST HEDGEROWS FOR   
 EASIER ACCESS TO FIELDS WHICH ALSO    
 MAKES MACHINERY MOVEMENT EASIER. THE  
 HEDGEROWS STILL STANDING ARE IN GOOD  
 HEALTH HOWEVER. IN THE{1950'S}AND     
 EARLIER, TO THIN OUT HEDGEROWS WAS NOT
 NECESSARY. AS THE MACHINERY WAS VERY  
 LIMITED, TO HAVE LARGE FIELDS THE     
 TOP SOIL WOULD EASILY BE BLOWN AWAY   
 BUT WITH THE MODERN MACHINERY AND     
 HAVING FERTILIZERS THIS IS PREVENTED. 
 SOME HEDGEROWS ARE OVERGROWN, THIS    
 GIVES INCREASED WILDLIFE AND MANY     
 BIRDS ARE INCREASING IN NUMBERS DUE TO
 THE FACT THAT THE NEARBY FARMERS HAVE 
 NOT THINNED OUT ANY MORE HEDGEROWS.{
