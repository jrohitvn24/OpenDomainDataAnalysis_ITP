		<content> The block probably contains the       
 greatest number of private fee-paying 
 schools in the city. Parents choose to
 send their sons and daughters to them,
 certainly for their more favourable   
 staff-pupil ratio. Some parents feel  
 their local maintained schools do not 
 coach their pupils in a sufficiently  
 demanding manner, especially in       
 'academic' subjects, the 'basics', and
 'discipline'. Some private schools    
 specialise int he arts, dance and     
 drama, others in coaching pupils for  
 entry to senior fee-paying schools. An
 entrance examination exists for these 
 schools with quite clearly laid down  
 syllabuses for children to work       
 towards at 13 years old. For example, 
 the recently established Leicester    
 Grammar School near the city centre   
 takes pupils at 11 and 13 years old.  
 Some pupils go on to boarding schools.</content>
