 LIVING IN WHAT ONE WOULD DESCRIBE AS A
 REMOTE AREA DOESN'T INTERFERE WITH THE
 QULITY OR ENJOYMENT OF LIFE.  ALMOST  
 WITHOUT EXCEPTION EACH HOUSEHOLD HAS  
 ITS OWN TRANSPORT WHICH SOON LINKS    
 THEM WITH THE ADJOINING VILLAGE OR    
 NEAREST TOWN FOR SHOPPING. ALL HOMES  
 HAVE ELECTTICITY, SO HAVE THE         
 ADVANTAGES OF FRIDGES, FREEZERS,      
 COOKERS, TELEVISIONS, VIDEOS AND      
 COMPUTERS, THE NUMBER DEPENDING ON    
 THEIR FINANCIAL STATUS.  THE TELEPHONE
 IS ESSENTIAL.  THEY INTERACT SOCIALLY 
 BETWEEN NEIGHBOURS AND AT DEBDHILL    
 FARM, THE FAMILY HAVE BUILT KTHEIR OWN
 SWIMMING POOL AND TENNIS COURTS.      
 FAMILY PETS ARE MUCH IN EVIDENCE,     
 PARTICULARLY CATS AND DOGS, THE LATTER
 EITHER AS GUARD OR WORKING. THE       
 FARMERS HAVE SHOOTING AND FISHING.    </content>
