		<title>18The Sandpits in Creeting</title>
		<content>    The sand and gravel pits in        
Creeting St. Mary are at present       
disused and the subject of several     
planning applications.  They do        
provide however a haven for wild life  
and an increasing number of flowers    
and trees are becoming established.    
    They were used on a commercial     
basis for over 50 years from at least  
1929 until 1982.                       
    Concrete blocks were made on the   
site, some of which were used to build 
bungalows in Jacks Green Road in the   
1930's.                                
    During the war years materials were
used from the pits to build runways at 
R.A.F. Wattisham.                      
    The end of the pits was hastened by
the A45 Needham Market bypass which was
re-routed through the pits in the early
1970's. A deep cutting was made and the
material used to build up the new road.</content>
