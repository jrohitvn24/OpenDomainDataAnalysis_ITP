		<content>Until about 20 years ago The Northway  
was a piece of open farmland.  The land
is quite steeply sloping and had not   
been used for building except for one  
farm.                                  
Today it has changed.  The land which  
is between Wolverhampton and Dudley at 
the edge of the West Widlands has been 
built on. There are now many detached  
and semi detached houses.  They have   
been built on all but the steepest     
ground which is now the back gardens of
the most expensive homes.  At the very 
top of the slope there is a small wood 
which makes the area look like the     
countryside.                           
From the new estate the view is very   
good.  You can see many kilometres into
nearby Staffordshire and Shropshire.   
You can see many fields and trees.  You
would not think you are just round the 
corner from the polluted West Midlands.</content>
