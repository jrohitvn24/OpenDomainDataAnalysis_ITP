		<content>   The congregation of St. Paul's      
 numbers  between 40 and 50. This      
 includes youngsters.  There has been a
 decline in the size of the            
 congregation in the last 25 years     
 because of the closure of the pits.   
 Numbers increase at the main Christian
 festivals.                            
   During the course of a year there   
 will be about 70 funerals for the     
 whole parish. 6 to 8 of these will be 
 burials and the remainder cremations. 
 20 to 30 wedding services are held    
 each year. Baptisms take place on one 
 Sunday each month. Services held every
 Sunday are Matins at 8.00 a.m.,       
 Communion at 10.30a.m. and Evensong at
 5.00p.m. There is no Sunday school    
 because there is no suitable room     
 available. Children are involved in   
 the choir and help as servers.The     
 vicar visits our school regularly.    </content>
