		<content> The Ford Motor Company now own the    
 airfield, and it would seem ideal for 
 the purpose it is used for.The runways
 remain, and on these both production  
 and prototype vehicles are tested.Part
 of the runway has been adapted to test
 the suspension of vehicles and the    
 varied surfaces include a quarter of a
 mile of--corrugated surface, simulated
 potholes and cobbles.There is also a  
 rough course of sand and gravel, with 
 various gradients.The man made mound  
 has a gradient of 1 in 6 on one side  
 and 1 in 5 the other.Wading           
 troughs have been made to test for    
 corrosion.                            
 The skin of the hanger remains,and    
 with a new roof is now used as a      
 workshop. A new building houses the   
 designers,and general office, and the 
 computers,that are linked with Fords  
 Dagenham.                             </content>
