		<title>17Where I spend my holiday</title>
		<content>  In our 6 week summer break our family
 go on holiday.We go for a fortnight   
 and mostly go to Spain.We fly there   
 and it is very exciting.              
  When we get there we find our        
 apartment and unpack.We dont do much  
 the first day just look around and    
 find where places are.In the evening  
 we would have something to eat.       
  The next day we would either go down 
 the beach or to the swimming pool and 
 sunbathe.My sister and I mostly swim  
 or make sand castles.In the afternoon 
 we would go and have a bite to eat,   
 then we would go back to the beach or 
 pool and sunbathe and make the most of
 the sun.                              
  About 5.00 we would go back to the   
 apartment and get washed and changed. 
 We would go and have a meal and go    
 somewhere to entertain ourselves.When 
 we get in we would go to bed.         </content>
