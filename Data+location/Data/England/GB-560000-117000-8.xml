		<content> The land is mostly heavy clay and     
 poorly drained, but areas of a fine   
 Tunbridge Wells sand are found on many
 farms. Most farms are small family    
 concerns employing at the most one    
 outside worker, but there remains an  
 unusually high proportion of tenanted 
 and leased land at a time when most of
 the farmland of Britain has become    
 owner occupied. The poor nature of the
 land has lead to a steady reduction of
 dairy farming with only some 5 herds  
 remaining. The greater part is under  
 permanent pasture used for beef and   
 sheep production, but the better      
 drained fields are cultivated for     
 cereals. Either way production is poor
 by national levels and land values are
 only held up by non agrarian factors. 
 There is an intensive poultry unit of 
 some 50,000 broilers, an intensive pig
 unit of 100 sows and some horticulture</content>
