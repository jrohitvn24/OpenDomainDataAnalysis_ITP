		<content> Over 30% of the houses in the area    
 were built before 1900, a number      
 dating from the Elizabethan period or 
 earlier.  There are a considerable    
 number of Grade II and Grade III      
 properties including Walkern Old      
 Rectory, a number of farmhouses, 25   
 houses or cottages in the High Street,
 the Vicarage at Ardeley and the houses
 surrounding the Green. There was a    
 significant amount of house-building  
 during the 20's and 30's. Fifty per   
 cent of the houses have however been  
 erected since 1945, including council 
 housing, and there are two substantial
 estates in Walkern. There are still a 
 number of tied cottages owned by local
 farmers and a handful of cottages in  
 Ardeley owned by the Church. Walkern  
 is one of 8 villages in East Herts    
 where planning permission bay be      
 granted for infill development.       </content>
