		<title>05BRICKMAKING - PROBLEMS</title>
		<content> 1.  Over 1,500 acres of good farm land
 has been worked and little has been   
 returned to agricultural use.         
                                       
 2.  L.B.C. have refused to fill in    
 pits if it costs money and therefore  
 there is an increasing amount of      
 derelict land.                        
                                       
 3.  The smell from the brickworks can 
 be a great nuisance.                  
                                       
 4.  Pollution containing sulphur      
 dioxide and fluorine is produced. A   
 Beds Times reporter (1978) suggested a
 farmer stood to lose much money       
 because his cattle are consuming      
 contaminated grass, and probably as a 
 result were suffering from a bone     
 disease called Fluorosis.  It was     
 suggested that back complaints in the 
 area may also be caused by this.      </content>
