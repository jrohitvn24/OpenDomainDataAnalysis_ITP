		<title>15Totternhoe bus service</title>
		<content> Totternhoe is served by the No. 61 bus
 service of the United Counties Bus    
 Company.  This particular route runs  
 from Luton bus station, through       
 Dunstable,Totternhoe, Eaton Bray and  
 on to Eddlesborough.  Some buses      
 terminate there, others travel on to  
 Aylesbury bus station.  The buses are 
 green in colour.  There are at present
 seven buses each way through the      
 village each week day and on          
 Saturdays.  There are also a few buses
 on Sunday.  In the past, there were   
 more buses than this coming through   
 the village, but in common with other 
 rural areas, the number of buses has  
 been declining.                       
 There are special schools' buses which
 collect children from the villages and
 take them the school in Dunstable,    
 bringing them home at night.  These   
 are also run by United Counties.      </content>
