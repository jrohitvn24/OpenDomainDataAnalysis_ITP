		<title>14CHILDREN'S GAMES IN BIBURY</title>
		<content> The most popular game children play is
 Tag. Tag needs four players or more.  
 Someone is 'on it'. You need a den    
 where others will be safe. The person 
 who is 'on it' has to count to ten and
 try to catch the others. If caught you
 become 'on it' and take your turn to  
 catch the others. In chain tag, those 
 caught join hands to make a chain to  
 catch the others. In 'of_ground tag'  
 you do not have a 'den' but are safe  
 if your feet are off_ground on a wall 
 or climbing frame.                    
 'Stuck in the mud' is like tag but, if
 caught, you stand with your arms and  
 legs stretched out. Other people can  
 free you by going under your legs or  
 arms. If you get caught three times   
 you become 'on it'.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
