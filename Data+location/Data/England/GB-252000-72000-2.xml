		<content> The River Walkham, rising on the west 
 side of Dartmoor below Cut Hill forms 
 a wide valley which runs southerly for
 the greater part of its length. It is 
 fast flowing,boulder strewn, with     
 steep sides to the valley floor and   
 trees growing to the water's edge.    
 There are many streams running into   
 the river and some ground is boggy.   
 After snow and heavy rain it tends to 
 flood. This area is very beautiful,   
 unpolluted and undeveloped. There is  
 good variety for wild life, being a   
 major spawning ground for salmon and  
 migratory trout. LEATS or open        
 conduits for water are a feature, in  
 some cases stillsupplying water for   
 farms. Just north of Feather Tor is an
 example of a "bull's-eye", where one  
 leat is diverted into three           
 directions.
