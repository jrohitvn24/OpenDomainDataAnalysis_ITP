		<title>15RED HOT BUSINESS! MUSTARD</title>
		<content>  The{fields}around Sherston were noted
 for many years for the range of useful
{herbs}that were grown, villagers in   
 their sixties can remember the        
 collecting and drying of the plants,  
 flowers and leaves as being a notable 
 local{occupation.}Even now some of the
 less'managed' fields yield a great    
 variety of{'wild' plants}as do the    
 verges of the minor roads and lanes.  
  Although some 14 years old and       
 originating from Urchfont there is now
 a business in the village concerned   
 with the production of high quality   
 and unusual{mustard mixes ,sauces and 
{jellies}for use on both hot and cold  
 meat.The mustards are produced by     
 stone grinding of the seed which is   
 then immediately mixed with the       
 appropiate liquids,{wine-  or cider-  
{vinegar}and other herbs and packed in 
 airtight jars to preserve the flavours</content>
