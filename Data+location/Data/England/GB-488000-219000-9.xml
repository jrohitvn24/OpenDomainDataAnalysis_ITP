		<title>09The Stable Yard, Mentmore</title>
		<content> The old Stable yard and coach houses  
 at Mentmore, which used to belong to  
 Mentmore Towers, have taken on a new  
 lease of life in the past 8 years     
 since they were purchased by their    
 present owners. Where there were once 
 derelict and deserted buildings, there
 is now a charming and beautiful       
 facility visited by about 2,000 people
 every month, and a source of pride to 
 the residents of the village.         
 Externally the buildings are          
 unchanged, but inside now flourishes a
 craft shop and tea room, bed and      
 breakfast accomodation, an antique    
 furniture restorer's workshop, and a  
 graphic designer rents out the old    
 granary. The Stable Yard has a staff  
 of 8 women, all local, employed on a  
 casual basis, and are a 'wonderful    
 team' - the owner's words.            
                                       </content>
