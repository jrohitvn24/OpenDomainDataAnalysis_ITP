		<content> Many of the shops in Southborough are 
situated along London Road. Although   
Southborough is quite small in size,   
there is a great variety of shops,     
mainly selling specialized goods.      
 'Liptons' and 'Co-op' are two of the  
five small supermarkets. There is only 
one bakery and this is very small. The 
'Southborough Delicatessen' is a new   
shop and is a favourite with many      
people. A similar shop is the          
'Southborough Pie Shop'. There is a    
wide selection of cafes and take-aways 
varying from a tea shop to one serving 
oriental food.                         
 Most essential services are catered   
for, from launderettes to banks and    
Building Societies. Southborough has   
two chemists. There are a few clothes  
shops which are expensive when compared
to shops in Tunbridge Wells, but the   
shopping area is easy to reach.        </content>
