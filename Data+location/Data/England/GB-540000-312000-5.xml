		<content>{Apples,pears}and{plums}are produced in
 great variety in the{orchards}of      
{Fenland.}Most apple and pear orchards 
 are grass_bottomed,but a few acres are
 under_planted with crops,such as      
 gooseberries.The trees are pruned in  
 the winter,and then sprayed throughout
 the spring and summer to guard against
 diseases.The most popular dessert     
 apple varieties are Cox, Worcester,   
 Laxton Fortune and Suberb, and        
 Discovery. Bramley cooking apples are 
 grown in far greater quantity than any
 others.The main plum varieties are    
 Czar, Victoria, Burbanks, and         
 Pershores. Conference, is the main    
 sort of pear;this crop is harvested in
 the late autumn and the fruit is often
 cold_stored, together with Bramleys   
 and Coxes, for later marketing        
 throughout the winter.
