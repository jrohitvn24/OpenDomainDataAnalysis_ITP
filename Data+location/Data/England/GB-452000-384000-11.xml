		<content> In Dinnington there are three places  
 for religous meetings. These are{St.  
{Leonards Church}(Anglican), a         
{Methodist Church}(both on Laughton    
 Road),and a{Catholic chapel}which St. 
 Joseph's primary school use for       
 mass.This is on Lidget Lane.          
{St. Leonards}was built in 1868 after a
 fire destroyed the original building. 
 It does not appear in the Domesday    
 Book and the name of the parish is    
 taken from{St. John's church}(now     
 derelict) which is at Laughton.{St.   
{Leonards}has no steeple and is at     
 present being modernised. The most    
 interesting thing about the{church}can
 be found in the vestry. This is the   
{map}showing how the village was       
 enclosed in 1778.This{map}is quite    
 famous since it appears in school     
 History books on the{Agricultural     
{Revolution.                           </content>
