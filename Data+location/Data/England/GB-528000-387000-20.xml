		<content> 4 yrs.ago a 40yr.old family man living
 in S.Elkington faced a diagnosis of   
 kidney failure.He underwent a kidney  
 transplant operation but this proved  
 unsuccessful,and he was forced to     
 travel 100 miles twice a week to the  
 Princess Royal Hospital,Hull to       
 dialyse.Both he and his wife were     
 trained to operate the machine.Their  
 garden was prepared for a cabin,drains
 dug,electric cable laid, and the cabin
 arrived by transporter.Watched by the 
 school children and their teachers it 
 was taken across a field and lifted by
 crane onto its site.This man dialyses 
 for 4 hrs.3 days a week at times when 
 he can immediately contact Hull in an 
 emergency using a phone in the cabin. 
 His wife is alerted by an alarm bell  
 in the house.All the family have had  
 to adjust,holidays are spent in a     
 specially equipped caravan near Whitby</content>
