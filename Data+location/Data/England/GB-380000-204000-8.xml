		<title>08A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A CHILD</title>
		<content> I wake up at 7.30 a.m., get dressed   
 and go downstairs.  I go out into the 
 garden and feed my rabbit with water  
 and rabbit food.  Then I go indoors,  
 have a wash and brush my hair.  I have
 my breakfast of cornflakes with cold  
 milk.  Michelle and Kelly go with me  
 to school.  When the whistle blows at 
 school we line up and go into the     
 classroom and after assembly we do    
 Maths.  It is soon playtime with more 
 Maths and English when we come in.  At
 12.00 a.m. it is dinnertime and       
 sometimes we have chips.  Afterwards  
 we do silent reading, Art and have a  
 story before we go home.  In the      
 evening I watch television, play games
 and then go to bed.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
