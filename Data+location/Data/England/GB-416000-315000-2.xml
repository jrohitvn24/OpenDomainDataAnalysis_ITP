		<title>02Alrewas Bowls Club</title>
		<content>Alrewas Bowls club is situated on a    
small piece of ground between the      
Church and the canal.  It has a crown  
green approx 40 x 30 yards which is    
maintained by the members.  The annual 
rent paid to the church is #10.  The   
club is between 80 - 100 years old.    
Most of the members are retired.       
24 are gentlemen and only 5 are ladies.
The club only plays friendly matches to
ensure that everyone has a game.  All  
members try to attend on Wednesday     
afternoons.  Games are played every day
of the week but, because of a          
condition of the lease, not during     
church services.  The season lasts     
from Easter until the weather breaks   
in the autumn.There is a small wooden  
club house where tea is brewed and     
equipment is stored.
