 We went to Wash Common Farm to ask the
 farmer some questions about the       
 farm.We found out that the farmer used
 several different types of            
 machinery:-tractors,ploughs,combine   
 harvesters,drills,rollers,bailer and a
 forage harvester.The farmer said he   
 liked working on his farm.His family  
 had been farming there for eighty     
 years.He told us that he kept cows ,  
 two dogs and cats. We found out that  
 he specialised in dairy cows which he 
 milks twice a day. He owns 500 acres  
 of land and 200 acres of it he uses   
 for growing crops. He grows barley,   
 oats, wheat and kale. He employs two  
 full time workers, one part time      
 worker and his mother helps with all  
 the paper work. After he answered our 
 questions he showed us round the      
 farm.                                 </content>
