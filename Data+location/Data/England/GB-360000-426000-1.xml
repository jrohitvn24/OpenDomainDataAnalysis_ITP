 AN INTRODUCTION TO HOGHTON            
 THE VILLAGE OF HOGHTON LIES JUST OFF  
 THE A675, THE OLD ROAD BETWEEN        
 PRESTON AND BLACKBURN.  THE AREA IS   
 DOMINATED BY HOGHTON TOWER, WHICH IS  
 SITUATED ON A WOODED ESCARPMENT IN THE
 SOUTH OF THE AREA.  FROM THIS         
 ESCARPMENT THE LAND SLOPES GENTLY     
 NORTHWARDS TOWARDS THE RIVER DARWEN,A 
 TRIBUTARY OF THE RIVER RIBBLE.        
 THE LAND IS MAINLY GIVEN OVER TO MIXED
 FARMING AND A NUMBER OF THE HOMES ARE 
 OWNED BY THE DE HOGHTON FAMILY, THE   
 OWNERS OF HOGHTON TOWER.  DESPITE THE 
 GROWTH OF NEW HOUSING ESTATES TO THE  
 WEST OF HOGHTON, THE AREA HAS REMAINED
 RELATIVELY UNCHANGED SINCE 1945.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
