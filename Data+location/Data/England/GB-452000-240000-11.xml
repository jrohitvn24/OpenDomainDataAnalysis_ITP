		<title>11The disused railway.</title>
		<content> In researching local history we have  
 found that this railway line was      
 originally called the Buckingham      
 railway. It was opened for passenges  
 on Ist.May 1850 from Bletchley to     
 Banbury. In 1878 the London North     
 Western Railway Company (L.N.W.R.)    
 built another line from Cockley Brake 
 to Blisworth. It is this line that    
 cuts diagonally across our area.      
 The presence of the disused track has 
 had an effect on the ecology of the   
 area. It has provided a sanctuary for 
 wildlife and many of the animals,     
 insects and plants find a home along  
 the old cuttings. Most of the track   
 can still be walked but farmers have  
 blocked parts of the way with mounds  
 of soil. We walked the track and found
 many of the plants and animals listed 
 with our ecology work.
