		<title>01BLOCK REVIEW, HOCKLIFFE</title>
		<content> This{rural}area includes{two hillsite}
{villages,}overlooking the surrounding 
 pastoral and arable area, dotted with 
{farmsteads;}and drained by{Clipstone }
{Brook.}The population, below a        
 thousand, has remained almost static  
 since the last century. Near{Hockliffe
{church}is land of{archaeological      
 interest; an{earthwork}and a{deserted 
{village,}neither of which have been   
 fully excavated. Although{Tebworth}has
 a church, it is placed a mile off in a
 field, not in our area.  Towards      
{Tebworth}the{topography}of the land   
 becomes hilly.  The residents of both 
 villages are mostly employed in nearby
 towns e.g.{Luton,}and some work as far
 afield as{London.  Tertiary}employment
 plays a{major}part in the village     
 occupations.{Our survey includes      
{studies of buildings, customs, roads, 
{changes and occupations.}             </content>
