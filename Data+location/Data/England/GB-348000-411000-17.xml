		<title>17Fairhurst Hall Parbold</title>
		<content>Fairhurst Hall stands in its own       
grounds to the east of the River       
Douglas.It was originally built of     
timber frames in the 18th century,     
but has been adapted several times.    
The barn at the bottom of the drive    
is converted into a house with a       
separate owner.Where the lawns stretch 
out and upwards at the front of the    
house-it was once dense forest,only    
a few enormous beech trees remain at   
the side.The kitchen and cook's        
quarters were where the back yard now  
is.The house is hidden from public view
but on the road side by the entrance   
gates is the lodge to Fairhurst Hall.
