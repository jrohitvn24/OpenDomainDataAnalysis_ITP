		<title>07AN AFTERNOON IN JASON's life</title>
		<content>   At dinner time I play football and  
 cricket butsometimes we play tig.When 
 we get back in class we will be       
 allowed to do our work for another    
 hour.I did some writing and drawing   
 about the civil war until home time at
 15.20. After school I go home with    
 Frank. At 19.30 we left from Franks to
 Huntingdon swimming club. When we see 
 what we've got to do then we dive into
 the pool and do all these things until
 21.00when we get out and get          
 changed.                              
 When I come out if I've got enough    
 money I normally buy a drink and then 
 I wait to be collected. When I get    
 home I have a wash then I get         
 undressed and go to bed.I normally    
 have a cup of coffee and after I've   
 drunk it I go to sleep.               
                                       
                                       </content>
