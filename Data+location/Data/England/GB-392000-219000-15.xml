		<title>15A POLICEMAN IN CHELTENHAM</title>
		<content> A police job is a hard and dangerous  
 one in some ways.This job is split    
 into different categories e.g.Traffic,
 Forensic,C.I.D.,Drug Squad,Fraud Squad
 and Autopsy.Forensic is a category    
 where they do lots of medical tests on
 all sorts of different things.C.I.D.  
 is short for Criminal Investigation   
 Department and they do exactly what   
 the words say,they investigate        
 criminals.Say there has been a murder 
 and someone saw him,the police would  
 make up a face with Identikit and then
 they would look out for the criminal. 
 Traffic Dept. is where you work on the
 streets.The Drug Squad work on        
 catching people who are supplying     
 drugs and they are helping the world  
 to be a much better place without     
 them.The Fraud Squad investigate      
 frauds of money and even in Cheltenham
 all these police depts. are very busy.</content>
