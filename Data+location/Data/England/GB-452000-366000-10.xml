		<title>10THE FRIDAY MARKET</title>
		<content>                                       
  Every Friday there is a market which 
 is the major highlight of the shopping
 week.It takes place in the centre of  
 Shirebrook . The market square has    
 recently been improved by             
 a) excluding vehicles except for      
 loading etc.                          
 b) being resurfaced with attractive   
 red paving bricks in a herring-bone   
 design.                               
 c) having raised flower beds built and
 grassy areas provided for sitting on. 
   Traders come from as far afield as  
 Leicester, Nottingham and Doncaster to
 set up their wares on permanently     
 erected metal stalls. Their day starts
 around 6:30 a.m. and usually they have
 packed up and gone by 4:30 p.m.       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
