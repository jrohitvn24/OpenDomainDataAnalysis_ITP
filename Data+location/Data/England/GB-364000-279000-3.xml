		<content>  Grass, Grass, Grass covers the land  
 in this rural area of smallfields (5  
 acres). The major task in our Domesday
 Project work has been to convey the   
 richness of an area which is isolated 
 and rural with only scattered         
 communities in a sea of grass, trees  
 and hedgerows. The visiting picnicer  
 sees beautiful,rolling countryside but
 very few dwellings.                   
  The grass ranges from intensively    
 managed grassland, rough pasture to   
 scrubby common land where sheep nibble
 between gorse and heather. Two old    
 meadows are specially protected by    
 conservation orders for their rare    
 orchids and other traditional meadow  
 flowers. Much time is spent tending   
 the grass, silaging, haymaking and    
 baling and the predominant colours in 
 the landscape reflect the work and the
 season.                               </content>
