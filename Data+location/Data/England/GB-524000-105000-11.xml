		<title>11News in Hove and Portslade</title>
		<content>  Hove is a very densely populated     
 area.The highest percentage of        
 residents are the elderly,which       
 constitutes problems for the rest of  
 the community.These people often      
 appear in the news on account of small
 accidents in their homes.An elderly   
 man was treated after a small fire in 
 his kitchen; a pan of food caught     
 alight.These accidents occur because  
 of the inability of the elderly to    
 look after themselves all the time.   
  Hove's local football club,Brighton  
 &amp; Hove Albion have avoided an         
 alcoholic drinks ban in their private 
 club where other clubs have failed.   
  Portslade has lost 217 jobs at the   
 Metal Box plant.The workforce was said
 to be too large and jobs had to be    
 axed.The south is luckily not a job   
 blackspot but a loss like this can    
 demoralise the local unemployed.      </content>
