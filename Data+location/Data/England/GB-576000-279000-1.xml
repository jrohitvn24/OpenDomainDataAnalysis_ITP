 Here is a whole block of cultivated   
 land, half coniferous forest and half 
 intensively farmed as part of the     
 Elveden Estate. There are no public   
 roads, access being only on a couple  
 of bridle tracks, all other tracks are
 private and lead to farm complexes.   
 For details of the forest section see 
 0580 0285 and for the farm refer to   
 0580 0276.                            
 The photographs for here show the     
 200 year old Scots pines which were   
 stunted when young to try to form a   
 hedge, and some of the recent planting
 which also acts as coverts for game   
 birds such as pheasants.
