		<title>05Ghosts in Beverstone Castle.</title>
		<content> There is a strong tradition that      
 Beverstone castle is haunted.The ghost
 of a monk has been seen in the        
 Berkeley Chapel.Servants who lived in 
 the main house adjoining the castle   
 have claimed to hear voices and music 
 drifting from the ruins during the    
 night.On one occasion,the butler heard
 so much noise that he became convinced
 that somebody was in the ruins.This   
 was unlikely as the only access was   
 from the house.When he went to        
 investigate he found that all of the  
 rooms of the castle were completely   
 empty!                                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
