		<content>Metro radio is our local commercial    
radio station.Favourite shows on it    
depend on age eg.Night Owls has mostly 
adult listeners and Nicky Brown Show   
has mostly school children.The number  
of listeners goes up after 4pm as      
people arrive home from school and     
falls again about 7pm as families      
settle down to watch TV.The            
broadcasting area reaches  from        
Peterlee in the south to Alnwick in    
the north,from Consett in the east to  
Whitley Bay in the west.The records    
they play are received,free, from      
artists and record shops.All shows are 
live except phone ins.These are not    
recorded,but have a 7 sec delay in a   
minute,so that if people swear or say  
anything not meant to be broadcast,    
they are cut off before they go on     
the air. There are adverts and jingles 
done as voice overs It began in Â£74    </content>
