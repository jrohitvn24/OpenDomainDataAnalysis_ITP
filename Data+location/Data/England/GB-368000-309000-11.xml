		<content>  Turnpike Court is an old folks' home 
 built in St. Georges in 1982. The old 
 folks have their own flats but 2 or 3 
 can live together if they want. They  
 cook their own food usually, but on   
 Monday they have their dinner         
 together, followed by talks, films or 
 concerts.                             
                                       
  There is a big room where they go and
 talk, play dominoes or cards and drink
 tea. Sometimes they have coach trips. 
 There is a lift for those who         
 cannot use stairs.                    
                                       
  The flats have a little kitchen,     
 bathroom, bedroom and a living room.  
 There is an intercom. If they need    
 help they can call the warden. As well
 as Turnpike Court there are 200 old   
 folks dwellings connected to the      
 warden's intercom.                    </content>
