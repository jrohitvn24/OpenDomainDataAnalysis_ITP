		<title>19Bexford Industries, Brantham</title>
		<content> On Tuesday 25th June 1985 we went to  
 visit Bexford Industries at Cattawade.
 Five hundred people are employed there
 working in four shifts, as the firm is
 working 24 hours a day. When we       
 arrived we were asked if we had any   
 lighters or matches on us because of  
 the explosive nature of the materials 
 used to make the plastics. We were    
 also given little red cards to wear to
 say that we were visitors. We first   
 visited the main store, containing    
 millions of pounds worth of equipment 
 ready for shipment all over the world.
 We were also shown the cold store     
 where they kept the microfilm, the    
 temperature was kept at 50 Farenheit. 
 We saw the plastic being cut and      
 packed. We then walked over to the    
 firm's own fire station, our guide was
 the chief of the fire station.
