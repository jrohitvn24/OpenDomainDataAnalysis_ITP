		<title>13MILTON MANOR ESTATE</title>
		<content> In the North-east corner of the area  
 is{Milton Manor Farm,}once part of the
 600 year old Estate. The farm, beside 
 the River Stour has pigs, sheep, bul- 
 locks and 50 acres of Spring Barley,  
 about 100 acres in all. The Manor     
 House was demolished in 1959, but the 
 church of St. John the Baptist still  
 stands although services were sus-    
 pended in 1980. Built in the 12th     
 century, it was restored in 1829,     
 with seating capacity for 52. When the
 church closed there were only 6 resi- 
 dents at Milton. The living was part  
 of Thanington and services were held 6
 times a year. Access to the little    
 flint church, with open bell cage, is 
 via the Public Footpaths which run    
 through the farm. The Robert Brett    
 Group, local quarriers, who own the   
 land, intend to preserve the church.
