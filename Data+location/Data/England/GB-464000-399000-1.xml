		<title>01Auckley-A changing village</title>
		<content>{Auckley}was called ALEHELEU in the    
 original Domesday book.Since then it  
 has changed its name several times.In 
 1294 it was known as ALKELAY.By 1327  
 this became ALKESLEYE,while in        
 Victorian times it was called AWKLEY. 
 It is only recently,since the 1960's  
 that its present spelling was adapted 
 as the correct one.This seems to      
 originate from the Scandinavian, Alka 
 meaning sea-bird and lea meaning a    
 clearing or meadow.                   
    Before the recent expansion in the 
 1970's,{Auckley}was basically a rural 
 community.Little remains of this way  
 of life today,although one family in  
 the village have farmed for probably  
 100 years.{Auckley}now serves as a    
 commuter village for Doncaster and to 
 a lesser extent R.A.F.Finningley.
