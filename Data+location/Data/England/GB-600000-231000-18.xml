   MR and MRS  Smart are the licencees 
 of the Cross Inn. They have been      
 licencees for seven years. The Inn has
 a very interesting history. It used to
 be a coaching Inn.Horses were kept    
 there and passengers stayed there     
 over night.They enjoy their work as   
 they like meeting people.They serve   
 meals, bar snacks and morning         
 coffee. Most of their customers are   
 local, but they also cater for coach  
 parties.                              
   A story tells of a man who died in  
 his bed, and Mrs Smart says that she  
 hears him calling.                    
   The Inn stands at the crossroads,   
 opposite Cage Lane. Drunken people    
 were locked in the cage over night    
 until they were sober.
