 have influenced "Transport."The most  
 recent has been the building and      
 opening of the{M25 }by Balfour Beatty 
 Atkins at a cost of Â£20m,which links  
 our area to the {M1,M3,M4 }and {M11 } 
 to name but a few.   Housing prices   
 increased greatly as traffic          
 increased.  We calculated,on a recent 
 survey beside an average road at 'off 
 peak' hours that 150 cars, 2 buses, 11
 vans,9 lorries,9 bicycles and 2       
 motorcycles passed.   At 'on peak'    
 hours we realised that there would be 
 many more vehicles.                   
    Buses also play a vital role in    
 transport.The buses themselves are    
 mostly {Green Line }in this particular
 area but {Alder Valley }buses which   
 have a main bus station in Addlestone 
 can be seen occasionally.The main     
 routes in a circle: {Addlestone       </content>
