		<title>09Mortimer Farm + Nature Trail</title>
		<content> The fruit farm was previously a       
 country estate. Coming into the farm  
 you see goats and ducks and the farm  
 shop. There is a playground with      
 apparatus made of tree trunks and     
 rope. Cream teas are sold in an old   
 cow-shed. The farm grows strawberries,
 raspberries, currants, tayberries,    
 gooseberries and grapes. People pick  
 their own fruit and pay at the shop.  
 Many local families help with the     
 summer picking for market. Behind the 
 farm is woodland which forms part of  
 the childrens nature trail. Along this
 trail you could see goldfinches,      
 woodpeckers, blackbirds, thrushes and 
 yellow-hammers. There are many        
 butterflies and some beehives. Tucked 
 away is an old ice-house of brick.    
 People from the house kept their food 
 cool in summer by filling it in winter
 with ice from the pond.               </content>
