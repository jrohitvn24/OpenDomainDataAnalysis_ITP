		<content>  As well as looking at the rocks of   
 the quarry we also had a look at the  
 plants that grow there now. As it has 
 been disused for about eighty years   
 all sorts of plants have been allowed 
 to grow and now cover almost all the  
 quarry. There are a few bare patches  
 where you can still see the rock that 
 used to be quarried.                  
  We discovered three main areas in thw
 quarry. In the north there is a       
 flattish part. This is where it was   
 filled with rubbish and grassed over. 
 We called this area 1. This leads to  
 the floor of the quarry which is much 
 lower (area 2) and there are three    
 steep sides around the western,eastern
 and southern parts (area 3).The       
 commonest plant in area 1 is grass    
 with buttercups and daisies. Area 2 is
 rosebay willow herb and tall grasses. 
 There are willow,alders, and oak trees</content>
