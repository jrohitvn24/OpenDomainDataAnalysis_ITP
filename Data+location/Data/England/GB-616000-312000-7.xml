		<title>07GHOST STORIES,DRAYTON AREA</title>
		<content>      Two places in the area have      
 stories attached to them concerning   
 strange happenings;{Bugg's Grave}&amp;    
{Ghosthill.                            
{     Bugg's Grave},on the Reepham     
 Road, is named after a certain Mr.    
 Bugg who stopped at a crossroads on   
 his way from Norwich,one night.His    
 grey horse was found at the crossroads
 as was Bugg,the latter hanging in a   
 tree, dead.Bugg's body disappeared,but
 his horse has been seen on dark       
 nights.                               
     {Ghosthill}is in Taverham and     
 there are conflicting stories as to   
 the identity of the ghost;he is either
 a monk or a soldier,who hanged himself
 in a tree.Not many people have seen   
 him,but there are many stories        
 concerning the sighting of a white,   
 smoking cross,which has been seen by  
 young and old alike.                  </content>
