		<title>16FISHING IN THE FENS</title>
		<content>    There are several kinds of coarse  
 fishing.The most common are ledgering 
 and float fishing. The equipment you  
 want is easy to buy.All you want is a 
 rod and a reel and some floats        
 and some weights and a few hooks and  
 some maggots.You might have a landing 
 net.                                  
    The pike is the biggest fish which 
 is caught in our waters.Other popular 
 fish are roach,perch,gudgeon and eels.
    Hundrds of anglers come by bus to  
 fish in our waters at the week ends   
 from angling clubs in Sheffield and   
 Rotherham.Their clubs own the         
 fishing rights along some of the      
 waters. The main fishing season starts
 in July.                              
    The best places to fish are in the 
 Slacker near Black Dyke and under the 
 bridges along the North Level Main    
 Drain.                                </content>
