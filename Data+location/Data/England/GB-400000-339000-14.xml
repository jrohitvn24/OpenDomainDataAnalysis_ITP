		<title>14Heath House</title>
		<content>Heath House is situated in Hollington  
Road,Tean. The present house was built 
by the Philips family about 145 years  
ago although an earlier house,now      
demolished,was built on the site in    
1500. It is believed that the Philips  
family originated in Holland and on    
their arrival in this country set up   
the textile mill in Tean. The mill is  
still working but ceased to belong to  
the Philips family approximately 40    
years ago.During the second world war  
the house was used as a Red Cross      
Convalescent Home.Heath House is still 
well maintained and is lived in by Mrs 
A.B.Philips,her late husband having    
died in 1983.The lodges,stables and    
various out buildings are inhabited by 
other families.The rooms contain many  
valuable antiques and paintings        
including one by the artist Opie.
