		<title>13Hanley Castle Parish Council</title>
		<content> At the last Annual General Meeting of 
 the Parish Council on May 23rd 1985,  
 several local issues were dealt with. 
 It was asked that builders carrying   
 out alterations to property in the    
 area should leave no rubbish around.  
 Many people are concerned with the    
 attractiveness of both Hanley Swan and
 Hanley Castle,as they enter a biennial
 'best kept village competition'.      
    The Senior Residents receive a     
 yearly travel token of Â£7 each.As so  
 few buses run in the area,the Chairman
 wondered if a more efficient way of   
 using the money could be found.       
    Complaints about punctures to      
 bicycle tyres after farmers had been  
 hedge cutting with modern equipment.  
 The Chairman himself a farmer promised
 to have a word with local farmers to  
 ask for their co_operation in tidying 
 the roads after hedge cutting.        </content>
