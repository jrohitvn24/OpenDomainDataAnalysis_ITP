		<title>19The Swan Inn.</title>
		<content>The Swan Inn was established in 1362   
by the monks of Thame. It was first    
used as a brewery. A large secret      
tunnel was supposed to lead from the   
Swan under lands hostile to the monks  
to their monastery in Thame Park.      
The Inn was enlarged in the 16th       
century using ships timbers, many of   
which survive today, as does an earlier
painted wooden post. Queen Elizabeth I 
used to visit the Swan when it was used
as a coaching stop from Wycombe to     
Oxford. During the Civil War, Charles I
stayed at the Inn while his men camped 
in the field at the back. Lambert used 
the Inn as his Headquarters for a time.
In more recent times the Inn has been  
extended to include a ballroom and     
resturant. Some of the bedrooms contain
Adams fireplaces,including the Queen   
Victoria room where the queen stayed   
as a young girl.                       </content>
