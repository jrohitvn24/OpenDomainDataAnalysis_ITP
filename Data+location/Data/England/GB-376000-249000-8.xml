		<title>08WHEELWRIGHT</title>
		<content> Mr Jones is the wheelwright and his   
 workshop is located :North of the     
 Worcester and Hereford road as soon as
 you go past the Malvern road and the  
 oasthouses.We asked Mr Jones how      
 often does he sell wheels ?           
 He said ,                             
 "I don't sell as many wheels now as   
 I used but when someone wants one I   
 make one."Mr Jones makes everything   
 wooden like window frames and signs   
 .The only time Mr Jones hurt himself  
 was when he broke his thumb by        
 dropping a bit of timber on it .The   
 business has been in the family since 
 1896.MrJones has been in the business 
 for 50 years having taken over from   
 his father twelve years ago.His       
 biggest present order is a new snooker
 table.He still uses wooden tools some 
 of which are more than 50 years old.
