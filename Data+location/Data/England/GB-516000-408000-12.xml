		<content> Mrs Hay asked us all what our parents 
 jobs were and eight people had parents
 that were teachers.The next one which 
 had the most people in was the haulage
 business,people who work on lorries   
 that drive about the country.The next 
 one is the domestic work which is when
 you do house work or clean in hotels  
 as my mum does.Most of these  were our
 mothers.There are five people who work
 at the oil industry Conoco and Lindsey
 oil refinery near the Humberbank.It's 
 very surprising that although farming 
 is a big business there is only one   
 person working on a farm.Many people  
 work in offices and factories in      
 Grimsby and Immingham.
