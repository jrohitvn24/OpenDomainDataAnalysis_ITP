		<title>05HOUSING IN BARNOLDSWICK</title>
		<content> All of the older houses in            
Barnoldswick are stone built with      
natural blue slate roofs. The majority 
of these are through-terraced houses   
with just a few back-to-back terraces  
remaining near the centre of the town. 
Most of these houses were built around 
1900. Barnoldswick expanded rapidly    
with the introduction of cotton mills  
to the area.                           
 A few older houses have been cleared  
and replaced with modern brick built   
semis,detached houses and also some old
folks homes,but many have been         
renovated and now make sound family    
houses or charming cottage type        
properties.                            
 Around the outskirts of the town      
modern housing estates have sprung up. 
These consist of detached and semi-    
detached houses and bungalows built in 
a variety of materials.                </content>
