		<content> Ponders Lodge Farm is situated in the 
 Fyfield area.   The farmhouse dates   
 back to the l6th century.   It is at  
 present occupied by Miss Boyton and   
 her sister Mrs. Wheel who used to     
 teach in the village school.   Miss   
 Boyton has lived in the area all her  
 life.   Her father owned the farm     
 before she took it over in l942.   She
 owns l40 acres of land growing wheat, 
 barley and rape.   She makes good use 
 of her garden.   She has 20 crossbreed
 cows and some chickens.   She employs 
 one person.   The equipment mainly    
 consists of plough, drill and a       
 cultivator, three Fordson tractors.   
 Miss Boyton considers that            
 the most important changes have been  
 the use of the combine harvester and  
 crop spraying.
