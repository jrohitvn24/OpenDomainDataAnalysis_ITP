		<title>01A Descripti0n Of The Area</title>
		<content>   The area consists of the villages of
 Crowton, Norley, part of Acton Bridge 
 and a relatively modern private       
 housing development called Delamere   
 Park approximately 10km from          
 Northwich. The landscape is mainly    
 low-lying agricultural land drained by
 streams flowing northwards to the     
 River Weaver, but rising quite steeply
 in the southwest upto the village of  
 Norley.                               
  The B5153 Northwich to Frodsham road 
 goes through Crowton, and a number of 
 small unclassified roads criss-cross  
 the whole area.                       
  In Crowton, village life is situated 
 alongside the road, around the church,
 primary school, village hall, pub,mill
 and shop.  However Norley is more     
 dispersed.  The shops and houses are  
 more widely spread, and there is no   
 definite village centre.              </content>
