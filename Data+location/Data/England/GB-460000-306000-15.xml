		<title>15THE FOSSE WAY</title>
		<content> The{Fosse Way}was one of the most     
 important Roman roads in this country 
 and runs through our block.It ran from
 Exeter (Roman Isca) to Lincoln        
 (Lindum) and passed through the heart 
 of present-day Leicestershire.The A46 
 follows the old road almost exactly   
 from Leicester to Lincoln and much of 
 the route survives south of Leicester 
 on the way,through the Cotswolds,to   
 Exeter.The road was originally built  
 to link forts constructed soon after  
 the Roman invasion of AD43;these were 
 built to keep in check Celtic tribes  
 hostile to Rome.The road became an    
 important commercial route after its  
 military use had ended.It has given   
 its name to several local streets,    
 firms ,schools and sports teams       
 (Leicester City FC was once Leicester 
 Fosse).There is a local"pub" on the   
 Melton Road called the{Fosseway.      </content>
