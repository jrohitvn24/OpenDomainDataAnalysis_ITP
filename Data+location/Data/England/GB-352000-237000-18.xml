		<title>18Shopping from Hampton Bishop</title>
		<content>   When we visited Hampton Bishop we   
 intended to survey the shopping       
 facilities available.                 
    For many years the only shops in   
 the village itself have been a general
 store and a Post Office .In 1974 the  
 two shops were combined and occupied  
 the same premises.                    
    On our visit we discovered that    
 this shop has now closed and that the 
 villagers must travel to other places 
 to do their shopping.                 
     The local people we interviewed   
 regretted this very much but admitted 
 that they had tended to take the      
 facilities for granted and had not    
 patronised them as much as they might 
 have done.                            
   We discovered that the majority of  
 the people now shop in Hereford, but  
 others also travel to Worcester,      
 Mordiford and Withington.             </content>
