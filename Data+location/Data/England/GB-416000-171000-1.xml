		<content>{Ogbourne St Andrew}and Ogbourne St    
 George are small quiet villages       
 with a varied age range.The houses in 
 them are mixed and made of stone and  
 mortar, brick and mortar, thatch and  
 clay tiles.Both villages have post    
 offices combined with grocers.The     
 houses are a mixture of privately     
 owned, council and farm houses.The    
 Swindon road passes by both places.   
 There used to be a railway but the    
 road is the only means of travel.     
 Ogbourne St Andrew has a medium size  
 church.3 arable farms dominate the    
 area,concentrating on crops and dairy 
 herds.A brook from a spring goes      
 through the villages.Fields and woods 
 surround them but they are slowly     
 disappearing because of new           
 developments.Both villages have a     
 school as their focus;Ogbourne St     
 Andrew is private,St George is state. </content>
