 The area contains the section of the  
 attractive Medway valley between      
 Yalding and Wateringbury, bordered to 
 the east and south by Yalding Hill and
 Bow Hill. The rows of hop poles and of
 fruit trees and bushes on Yalding Hill
 are a pleasant sight. Oast houses are 
 a prominent feature of the landscape, 
 although few are now engaged in drying
 hops. Rivers feature prominently in   
 Yalding and Wateringbury and in summer
 there is considerable boat travel.    
 Yalding Town Bridge is, at 450 feet in
 length, the longest ancient stone     
 bridge of its kind in the county. By  
 its west side, and opening directly on
 to the bridge, is Bridge House. In    
 Yalding the Yalding &amp; Nettlestead     
 Protection Society has improved the   
 landscape by planting trees. Landscape
 is changing rapidly.                  </content>
