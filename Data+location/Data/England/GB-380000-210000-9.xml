 has a staff of Headmistress (Mrs      
 Hodgson), 2 full-time &amp; 1 part-time   
 assistant teachers and a welfare

 class and eventually leave for        
 secondary school at the age of 11+.   
  The school has a temporary building  
 to accomodate the younger children. It
 has a large playing field adjacent to 
 the main building though this is      
 shared with the village. There is a   
 lady caretaker who lives nearby.      
  The parents play an active part in   
 school activities and are at the      
 moment involved in a school production
 of a play written by one of the       
 parents. The play is caleed 'Small    
 World".
