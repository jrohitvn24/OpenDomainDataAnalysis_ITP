		<title>01North Runcton and Middleton.</title>
		<content> The area contains the villages of     
 North Runcton and Middleton about     
 three miles south-East of Kings       
 Lynn.They stand on a ridge running    
 West to East with marshy land to the  
 North and South.                      
{ Farming}is the main economic activity
 and the villages were once  mainly    
 agricultural communities. Now only a  
 small proportion of the villagers work
 on the land and most commute to Kings 
 Lynn to work.                         
  The older buidings in the villages   
 are often built of{carstone,}the local
 brown sandstone. In the last thirty   
 years there has been much new building
 in brick, often bungalows.            
  The{A47}trunk road runs along the    
 ridge and passes through Middleton.   
{ Population}in 1981 (1961 in brackets)
 was:- Middleton  1178 (976)           
   North Runcton   540 (383).          </content>
