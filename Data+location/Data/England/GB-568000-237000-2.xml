		<title>02FARMING IN STAMBOURNE 1</title>
		<content>  Farms in this area are divided into  
 three types. 1)Large solely arable    
 2)Small solely arable 3)Small mixed,  
 that is arable and animals.           
  The size of farms varies from 40 to  
 2000 acres. As some of the smaller    
 farms, under 150 acres, do not provide
 an adequate income, some of the owners
 of these units supplement their income
 with a second occupation. The usual   
 alternative is to do contract work for
 another farmer. Others do haulage work
 and one is a bus driver.              
  The crops grown are wheat, barley,   
 beans, peas, oilseed rape, durum wheat
 and sugar beet. Oilseed rape is only  
 grown on large farms. Sugar beet is   
 only grown on one large farm and a    
 field of durum wheat was grown on one 
 large farm for the first time this    
 year.
