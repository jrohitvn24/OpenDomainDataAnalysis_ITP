		<content>{Ewyas Harold Village}is small but not 
 as small as some of the villages in   
 Herefordshire with its{population}of  
 nearly{1000.}There are{5 shops}and    
 there are{3 pubs}called The Dog, The  
 Temple and The Red Lion. The school we
 are in now was built in{1976}and the  
 old school was built in{1843.} We now 
 use the old school for the pre-school 
 playgroup, Adventurers,Brownies and   
 Guides and in the summer holidays we  
 have holiday club. There is a field   
 which we call the playing field where 
 there are some swings, a slide,       
 seesaw and a roundabout.There are     
 football, putting and cricket. The    
 village is also lucky to have a       
 doctors' surgery and a dentist.
