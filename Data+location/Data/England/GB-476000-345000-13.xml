		<content> The riding club started in the summer 
 of 1983.It all happened when Mrs      
 Merrin let people come and ride in her
 field.So in the six weeks holiday Mrs 
 Connole and Mrs Merrin arranged a one 
 day event.Everything went so well,    
 they officialy formed a committee in  
 October 1983.They now have 65 members 
 from all over the place.The committee 
 now arranges a one day event every    
 month.There are also two lessons every
 Saturday by a paid instructor. The    
 price is Â£1.50.Every member has to pay
 a yearly subscription of Â£2.50 .In the
 winter months there are tack cleaning 
 evenings,video films,vet talks and    
 quizes.They all take place in our club
 room at Mr and Mrs Walker's farm.
