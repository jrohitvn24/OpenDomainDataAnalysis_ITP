		<title>16ASHWELL FIELD STUDIES CENTRE</title>
		<content> During school terms Ashwell village is
 often busy with school children       
 carrying out local environmental      
 research.They come from schools all   
 over Hertfordshire and are based at   
 the{Old Merchant Taylor's School}in   
 Mill Lane.The Victorian schoolrooms   
 now serve as the County Council's     
 Field Studies Centre.                 
 Ashwell is small enough for children  
 to survey quite easily.Many buildings 
 are historically interesting and the{ 
{Museum}and{medieval graffitti }in the 
 Church are worth a visit.The village  
 is also useful because of its natural 
 springs at the foot of a chalk ridge. 
                                       
 Local people have mixed views about   
 the Centre.The children are mostly    
 made welcome but some people think    
 that they are a bit of a nuisance!!
