      In response to a long campaign   
for one, the Health Centre opened in   
1981. Two health visitors have         
responsibility for schools within the  
locality and for co-ordination of      
health and social services for the     
whole community. A chiropody service is
available for older people, and once a 
week there is a special clinic for the 
over sixty-fives, giving advice on     
health and social problems. A mother   
and baby welfare clinic is held once a 
week.                                  
      Based at the Centre are District 
Nurses who make home visits to care for
the elderly, or to provide aftercare   
following hospital treatment. One      
family doctor holds his surgeries on   
the premises.                          
      There is no dentist or optician  
at present.                            </content>
