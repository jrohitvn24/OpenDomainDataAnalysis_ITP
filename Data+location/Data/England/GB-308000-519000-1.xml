		<title>01LAMPLUGH GREEN.</title>
		<content> Most of the village of Lamplugh lies  
 outside the hamlet of Lamplugh Green  
 and as such is outside this Domesday  
 block. The vilage is widely scattered 
 lacking a residential centre in the   
 traditional sense. The reports in this
 section seek to give an impression on 
 some of the activities which shape and
 influence the lives of those living in
 the area. Many committees and         
 organisations have the name Lamplugh  
 but lack a base which ties them to a  
 specific place, these are included in 
 this section. The Lake District       
 National Park covers much of the area 
 which is both open and fenced fell    
 land. This is used for grazing by the 
 farms: Smaithwaite, Cockan, Cockley   
 Gill, Lamplugh Hall and Scalesmoor    
 There are many footpaths and these are
 used by walkers. The area is used     
 extensively for recreation.           </content>
