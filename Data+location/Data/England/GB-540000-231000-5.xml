		<title>05The Fiddler George Legend.</title>
		<content> Anstey school badge shows a fiddler   
 and dog.The legend is old but all the 
 places can be visited today.George was
 playing his violin at the Chequers    
 inn.The locals were talking of the    
 Devils hole,a haunted cave.George     
 thought the story stupid,he would walk
 the tunnel and prove it.Playing his   
 fiddle,dog behind,he entered the cave.
 All was quiet.Suddenly screams came   
 from the ground.The dog ran from the  
 cave,every hair singed from it's      
 body.George was never seen again.The  
 legend was born.The castle mound,the  
 Chequers and cave gate can be seen    
 today.Old men of the village say that 
 the path of the tunnel can be seen    
 when it snows.
