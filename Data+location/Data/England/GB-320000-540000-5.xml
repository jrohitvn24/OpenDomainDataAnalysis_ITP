		<content> Our television is in the living       
 room.My family watches it a lot.Most  
 people have a television.My favourite 
 programme is Dallas,which is an       
 imported programme from America.      
 It is about two families,both in the  
 oil business. It is on every Wednesday
 at 20.10 hours on B.B.C.one,after     
 Coronation Street, which is on Border 
 Television.Me and my mam watch        
 Coronation Street and Dallas because  
 they are so good. I watch television  
 every evening when I get home from    
 school.Everybody I know has a         
 television.We also watch television at
 school.The programmes are on all sorts
 of topics and are specially made for  
 schools.                              
 A television is like a box run on     
 electricity and when you switch it on 
 you can watch films and sport and lots
 of other things.                      </content>
