		<title>11SHOPPING:HINTON CHARTERHOUSE</title>
		<content>  THERE IS ONLY ONE SHOP IN HINTON     
 CHARTERHOUSE-A{GENERAL STORES.}FOUR   
 PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYED HERE, ON DIFFERENT
 SHIFTS, BUT WITH ONLY ONE PERSON      
 SERVING AT ANY ONE TIME.              
  THE SHOP IS VERY MUCH THE CENTRE OF  
 VILLAGE LIFE DURING THE DAY, AS MOST  
 OF THE CUSTOMERS ARE LOCAL PEOPLE, WHO
 CALL IN FOR A CHAT AS WELL AS TO BUY  
 THE GOODS THEY NEED. ALTHOUGH THE     
 PRICES ARE SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN IN THE
 TOWN, THE ELDERLY INHABITANTS PREFER  
 NOT TO HAVE THE TROUBLE OF A BUS      
 JOURNEY TO OBTAIN THEIR WEEKLY        
 SHOPPING. AFTER ALL, THE SHOP CATERS  
 FOR MOST OF THEIR NEEDS, AS IT SELLS  
 GROCERIES, FRESH FRUIT AND VEGETABLES,
 NEWSPAPERS AND MEDICAL GOODS.         
  SHOPLIFTING IS NOT A MAJOR PROBLEM   
 FOR THE STORES, ALTHOUGH SEVERAL      
 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SUSPECTED, AND ONE   
 HAS BEEN CAUGHT.                      </content>
