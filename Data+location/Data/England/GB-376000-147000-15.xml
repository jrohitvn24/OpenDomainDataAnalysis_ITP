		<content> We took a sample of 270 children and  
 discovered that 160 usee the Sports   
 Centre regularly, 100 used it seldom  
 and only 11 never used it all.        
 Swimming was the most popular sport as
 one would expect and Table Tennis     
 second most popular.  Of the ball     
 games, football was the most popular  
 in Winter and cricket in Summer.      
 Other games like rugby, basketball and
 hockey were also played.              
 Of the same sample all but five       
 children went on holiday each year.   
 The largest group (l53) had a holiday 
 in Britain whilst  others went abroad 
 or alternated holidays abroad with    
 ones in Britain.                      
 The car was by far the most popular   
 mode of transport whether the children
 were holidaying at home or abroad.    
 The coach was the least popular.
