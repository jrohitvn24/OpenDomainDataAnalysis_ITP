		<content> With the exception of the tower the   
 church in Wootton St. Lawrence was    
 rebuilt in 1868 when                  
 the south aisle was added.The south   
 doorway was rebuilt and partly        
 restored.When they were rebuilding the
 church they found a wooden trowel in  
 one of the pillars. They are linked   
 with Oakley parish.The family service 
 is held there.They have holy communion
 once a month.The organ used to be a   
 pump organ but now it's an electric   
 organ.Mr.Butler was an 17th century   
 vicar who wrote the first book on     
 bees.The church has a copy of it      
 and there is a stained glass window of
 him holding the bee book.Both the book
 and the window are quite well known.  
 There have been 43 vicars since       
 1300.
