		<title>17HULL:LOCAL EXPRESSIONS</title>
		<content>      People in Hull have many         
 expressions which seem to be peculiar 
 to the city and its environs.   A     
 man's wife is often referred to by him
 as "Our lass".   Members of a family  
 are usually "our ---".                
      When a local person is lost for  
 words and cannot name an item, it is  
 referred to not as a "whatsit" or a   
 "thingumajig" but as a "you-know" with
 the emphasis placed on the first word.
      In Hull, access to the rear of a 
 property is via a "tenfoot" - not a   
 "backstreet".                         
      Children are invariably referred 
 to as "the bains" (not "bairns").     
      Hull citizens of all social      
 classes frequently use the term "I    
 aren't" rather than "I'm not".        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
