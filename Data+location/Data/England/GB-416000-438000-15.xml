		<title>15Christian T****</title>
		<content> Christian is Sydney T****'s grandson. 
 He has just left school and is waiting
 to return to school to study for A    
 Levels. He wants to study Art.He's not
 so forthcoming with information as his
 grandfather but he does represent a   
 distinct point of view.For Christian, 
 Thackley is a place to live and play, 
 nothing else.He goes to school in     
 Shipley,for fun he goes into Leeds or 
 Bradford.The only amusements for him  
 in the village are the Cricket and    
 Football clubs.He enjoys walking and  
 has recently taken up jogging,and     
 loves the paths through the woods. For
 an arty person like him,Thackley is a 
 desert.The nearest approaches to      
 culture are the band concerts in the  
 Methodist Church.The best things about
 Thackley are the frequent buses to    
 take him into town, and the late night
 ones which bring him home again.      </content>
