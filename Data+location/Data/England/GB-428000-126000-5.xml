		<title>05Farming survey by pupils</title>
		<content> The children decided that the area we 
 had been allocated comprises farms and
 woodland. Our next task was to find   
 out what was happening on these farms 
 and to do this we asked the farmers to
 complete a questionnaire we devised.  
 We soon received replies and          
 invitations to see the farms for      
 ourselves. We soon found out that     
 Cadbury Farm is a private house and   
 office for a property developer but   
 the land and Spearywell Farm is owned 
 by the National Trust and farmed in   
 conjunction with Hatt Farm.           
 School Farm house is a private house  
 and the farm buildings are south of   
 our area. Lockerley Water farmhouse is
 a private house and the land owned and
 used by a neighbouring farmer for     
 sheep. His farm is out of our area.   
 Mill Farm was sold by the Dalgety     
 estate (Lockerley Hall) &amp; is derelict.</content>
