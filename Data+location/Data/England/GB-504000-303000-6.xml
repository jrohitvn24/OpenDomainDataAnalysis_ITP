		<title>06BURGHLEY :KITCHEN GARDENS</title>
		<content> We went to the Kitchen Gardens at     
 Burghley Park. When we got there some 
 of us drew the house.It is a large old
 house which is now empty.Part of it is
 an old apple store.At present it is   
 being restored.The house is made of   
 Barnack Ragstone and the roof of Blue 
 Slate.We were about to go when Mrs    
 Smith came.Her son rents the cottage  
 and garden at the back of the Kitchen 
 Garden House.He has a market stall    
 from which he sells plants.She told us
 how the workmen had decreased from    
 twenty men working on the house to    
 only two.The greenhouses at the back  
 of the house are now dangerous.Her son
 uses the Kitchen Gardens for          
 horticulture.
