		<title>09THE MINEHEAD HOBBY HORSE</title>
		<content> The M.H.H.is a Mayday custom. It is   
 said that long ago the people of      
 Minehead frightened away Danish       
 invaders by showing them the frenzied 
 horse. It does not look like a horse  
 but more like a covered boat frame    
 for is was the sailor men of the old  
 Quay Town who introduced the custom.  
 The horse is a frame of withy sticks  
 about 8 feet long carried on a man's  
 shoulders whose body and legs are     
 concealed by loose hanging sacking all
 round which are painted circles and   
 "the Sailor's Horse". The head is in  
 the centre- a grotesque painted tin   
 mask.Hundreds of ribbons cover the top
 of the framework and a long lashing   
 tail completes the horse.The horse is 
 accompanied by a drummer and a        
 melodian player who play "Soldiers    
 Joy" an old folk tune.
