		<title>07 Jogging on Skipwith Common</title>
		<content>The route and length of my run depend  
upon whether I am moving well by the   
time I reach the mile tree, a large oak
some three hundred yards short of the  
Common proper. I am feeling good-today 
is a four miler so I make a left turn  
along the first broad runway at the end
of which I burst through bush and      
cobwebs to join a narrow track which   
leads straight for Skipwith's square   
church tower. However, before the      
village is reached I join tarmac and I 
am heading Riccallwards again. I have  
seen a solitary Curlew, dozens of      
Magpies and Pigeons. I have frightened 
scores of Rabbits including one black  
one and put up numerous grouse and     
pheasant. I have heard a shot in the   
distance. I have seen no deer, vehicles
or people.
