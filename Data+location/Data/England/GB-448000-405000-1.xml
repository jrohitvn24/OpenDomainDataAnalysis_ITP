		<title>01Four Villages in S.Yorkshire</title>
		<content>   There are four{villages}in our area.
 They are called Marr,Hooton Pagnell,  
 Brodsworth and Hickleton.The{housing  
 is mostly made from{stone}quarried    
 locally.They are mostly cottages built
 for farm and estate workers. Lately   
 some of the cottages have been sold to
 outsiders who don't work in the area. 
 Of the three halls two of them are    
 still lived in by the local gentry. At
 Hooton and Hickleton lots of new      
 houses have been built out of local   
 stone.They are sold for high prices.  
 New houses at Marr and Brodsworth are 
 built of{brick}.There are only a few  
 council houses in our area at Marr and
 no special houses for old people.There
 are no industries although we are     
 surrounded by coal mines.The land is  
 used mainly for farming with some     
 private parks.There is no mains gas   
 and two villages rely on cess pools.  </content>
