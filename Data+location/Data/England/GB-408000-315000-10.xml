		<content>In our questionnaire we had a section  
for Leisure. We made a tally of our    
results to find most and least popular 
hobbies. From our results we found     
that Fathers' most popular hobby was   
Gardening, followed by Sport. Mothers' 
most popular hobby is Knitting,        
followed by Reading. The most popular  
sons' hobby is Football. Daughters, on 
the other hand like Reading the most,  
while collecting is second favourite.  
                                       
In the summer holidays there is a      
playscheme for two weeks of the six    
week holiday we have. This is run by   
the Local Parish Council. There are    
also a number of other clubs(Guides,   
Cubs,etc.) The range of clubs is       
anything from a leek growing club to   
Brownies. We had quite a job putting   
the Brownies.                          
                                       </content>
