		<title>19OUR HOUSE</title>
		<content> Our  house is a  detached bungalow. It
 overlooks  a number  of fields  and is
 built of stone  that is sandblasted to
 clean it. It has five bedrooms and two
 bathrooms one of which  will soon have
 a shower and the other another toilet.
 There is a dining roon and kitchen and
 also  a  living  room. We have a large
 garden that is hard to keep up to even
 with  two  lawn mowers and a strimmer.
 There is a garage and a greenhouse and
 it  has  a  long  drive that can cause
 problems  in a  bad winter.  My father
 and grandfather are making alterations
 and I help to mix concrete and put it 
 in the wheelbarrow and cart it around.
 I also  use the  lawnmowers to cut the
 grass for my parents. The lawnmower is
 quite  powerful.  I often have  to jog
 after the wheeled one but the Flymo is
 hard  to  push  because  it  is petrol
 powered.   {DAMIAN GAVAGHAN  ST.MARY'S</content>
