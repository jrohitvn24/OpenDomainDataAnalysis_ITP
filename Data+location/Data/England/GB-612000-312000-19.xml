		<title>19Local History of Taverham</title>
		<content>     {Taverham Hall manor}was rebuilt  
 in the 18th century. The family crest 
 is on the pier walls on the Ringland  
 side. Cottages opposite the gates to  
 the hall were built side on to the St.
 so that the cottagers couldn't see the
 comings &amp; goings from their windows.  
 The present building was built in 1860
 It had 12 gardeners and 10 domestics  
 at 4d. per week. In 1919 the estate   
 was sold, tenant farmers bought their 
 land and the{prep. school}was started.
      By 1701 the{mill}was making paper
 on a site in the Hall grounds and by  
 1845 produced paper for the{Times and 
{Mirror Newspapers, the Oxford English 
{Dictionary and bank notes.}There were 
 3 water wheels, 2 with a diam. of 4 m.
 and 1 of 2 m. There were 2 wells of   
 clean water for the paper and 3 sluice
 gates which still control the river.  
 In{1914-18}the cavalry used the wells.</content>
