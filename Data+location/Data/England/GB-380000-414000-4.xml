		<content>   Wash Lane Residents Action          
 Committee (WLRAC) held a meeting to   
 review their position.Mr.William      
 Rodgers commented,"We are not         
 convinced that the Motorway will solve
 the problem of heavy lorries using    
 Wash Lane,but we have been continually
 pleaded by the WLRAC that the motorway
 will help the residents' traffic      
 problem.                              
    Mr.Rodgers was the official opener 
 of the 23 million pound,6 miles       
 northern half of the M66.Work on this 
 road had started in 1975 although bad 
 weather delayed the opening by 6      
 months.Councillor Spurr the deputy    
 major of Bury said,"Bury is now the   
 hub of the system with a consequent   
 improvment in the life of the         
 community.
