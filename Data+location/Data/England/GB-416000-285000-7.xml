		<content> Of those who were questioned, the     
 majority were O.A.Ps. Many of them    
 still enjoy going out to dinner and   
 ballroom dancing remains very popular 
 with this generation. With the younger
 generations the discoteque and the    
 cinema continue to attract the

 diminishing because of the growing    
 impact of video. Bingo is still       
 popular with the O.A.Ps.              
     The traditional skills of reading 
 appears to have lost ground to the    
 computer and video games.             
     Theatre has maintained popular    
 appeal as a result of the pantomime.
