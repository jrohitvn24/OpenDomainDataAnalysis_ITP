		<content> Towards the three locks lies the      
 hamlet called{Bragenham}where there   
 is a cottage called Ludly cottage.    
 A man who lives there called Mr David 
 Scott. He seemed to know quite a lot  
 of local history. He told us the      
 cottage was once called Bragenham Farm
 for the reason that it was in         
 Bragenham on Bragenham lane. Ludly    
 means Low pastures. Why they called   
 the cottage Low pastures we do not    
 know. By the sign post is a Victorian 
 post box. This was usually only used  
 by two houses- Ludly cottage and      
 another house further up the track.   
 Half way down the track is a footpath.
 This footpath leads to a farm called  
 Bragenham farm. In the farm live Mr   
 and Mrs Gotzhein. Half way down the   
 footpath is a deep quarry. We're not  
 sure whether this was to do with the  
 brick works.                          </content>
