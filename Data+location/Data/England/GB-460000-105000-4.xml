		<content> He has lived in Portchester for forty 
 eight years and has seen Portchester  
 change, he believes, for the better.  
 He sees his main problem as continuing
 to live an active life, for he now    
 becomes easily worn out.              
 He sees the main national problem as  
 unemployment, especially amongst the  
 younger generation, brought on by     
 recent excessive wage demands by the  
 Trade Unions.  This could be solved by
 bringing down the inflation rate and  
 reducing the price of our goods abroad
 so that our international trade is    
 increased and jobs can be created     
 through this.
