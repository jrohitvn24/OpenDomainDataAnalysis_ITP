		<content>   Hungerford boasts several sporting  
 clubs including Soccer, Cricket,      
 Tennis, Squash, Bowls, Badminton and  
 Swimming. In a survey we conducted    
 over half of those who replied were   
 satisfied with the sports facilities  
 offered, although several would like a
 purpose built Sports Centre.Hungerford
 residents prefer taking part to       
 watching.Of those surveyed 66% said   
 they did take part in some sporting   
 activity but only 33% said they       
 watched sport taking place in the     
 town.                                 
   The Hungerford Town Football Club is
 the largest attracting crowds of a few
 hundred. The team is in the Premier   
 division of the Isthmian League.   The
 small clubs thrive too.Three years ago
 the Bowls Club built themselves a new 
 pavilion.At present there are 60      
 members,including 20 ladies.          </content>
