		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF AREA</title>
		<content> This area lies northwest of Somerton  
 and is a secluded region. To the north
 the land is flat, part of the Somerton
 Moor. The land is well drained with   
 deeply dug ditches. To the south on   
 the periphery are low undulating      
 hills. The land is mainly pasture     
 (dairy) but the fields which have been
 harrowed are fertile and wheat and    
 potatoes are grown. Many of the fields
 are small, however, and remain rough  
 pasture. The settlemant is dispersed  
 with no community centre within the   
 block and consists of individual      
 farms. There are a few modern         
 residences however. The roads running 
 through the area are narrow lanes     
 with high uncut hedges. There         
 are also many tracks and dead end     
 roads off these lanes.
