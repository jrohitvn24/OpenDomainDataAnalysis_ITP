		<content> Hutchinsons Drainage firm is based at 
 Whitewall Nook and does most of the   
{draining}in the area, the majority of 
 this is for reclamation of moorland.  
 This firm provides upwards of eight   
 jobs for local men. Other contracting 
 is done by farms who contract as a    
 sideline - a{haulage business}from    
 Shillafield, Lee Hall farm does a lot 
 of the{silage work}for neighbouring   
 farms providing 8-10 jobs on a casual 
 basis for 4-5 weeks in the silage     
 season. They also own a combine and   
 contract out to farmers who usually   
 only have between ten and twenty acres
 of grain. There are also several men  
 in the area who work casually doing   
 jobs such as{dry stone walling,}      
 shearing and harvest work. Few farms  
 can afford full time labour and rely  
 on these "casuals".
