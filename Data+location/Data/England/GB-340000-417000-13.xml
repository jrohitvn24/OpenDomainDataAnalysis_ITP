		<title>13Life at Holmes Church.</title>
		<content> The Church and Sunday School are used 
 for a lot of things. On Sunday morning
 chapel starts at half past ten.       
 Usually there are five hymns and one  
 of the children from the Bible. After 
 the collection the children go into   
 Sunday School where they sing choruses
 and have classes. At 2pm there is     
 Sunday School again, 5.50pm Prayer    
 Meeting 6.30pm Evening Service.       
   In Winter on Tuesdays there is a    
 Guild at 7.30pm. On Fridays at 7pm    
 there is a Youth Club. A few weeks ago
 we had a Walking Day joining with     
 Merebrow. The little ones ride on a   
 decorated trailer with Bible Texts on 
 it. The older ones walk behind the    
 Banner and Band.
