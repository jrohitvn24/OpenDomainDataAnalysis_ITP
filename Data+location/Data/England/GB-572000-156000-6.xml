		<title>06 COMMUTING FROM MAIDSTONE</title>
		<content>   {Commuting}has become known as the  
 curse of the South  East. Many brave  
 the daily struggle in and out of      
 London using the{railways.}           
    This area has two railway lines to 
 Victoria Station and Charing Cross    
 Station in London. The former is      
 served by Maidstone East and Barming  
 stations and the latter by the        
 Barracks Station.Between 06.30 and    
 08.30 and again from 17.30 to 20.30   
 they see a steady stream of commuters.
    The majority using this service are
 male and between 17 and 45 years old. 
 Most live within three miles of the   
 station,travelling to it by various   
 methods - car, moped, bus and cycle   
 and often by foot. Commuting is       
 becoming more popular in this area and
 its effects can be seen in the        
 expansion of the housing areas.
