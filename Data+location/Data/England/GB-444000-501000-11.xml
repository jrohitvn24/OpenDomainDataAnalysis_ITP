		<title>11Recreation, Swainby &amp; Potto</title>
		<content> There is no official{playing field}in 
 Swainby or Potto; all efforts to find 
 a suitable site for a play area have  
 so far failed.The school field is used
 only in school hours but children use 
 the Cricket Club's ground; football is
 played in the Black Horse field.{Horse
{riding}is increasingly popular, with  
 at least 34 horses in the two villages
 and a riding school nearby.{Active}   
{pursuits}include jogging, cycling and 
 motor cycling, while bowls and tennis 
 players use nearby courts,and swimmers
 go to Stokesley baths.Other activities
 are bird watching, astronomy, photo-  
 graphy, CB radio, local history and   
 handicrafts.{Gardening}is perhaps the 
 most popular recreation, extra effort 
 being put in when the villages enter  
 Britain in Bloom or Best Kept Village 
 competitions.{Indoor recreations}     
 include darts, discos and television. </content>
