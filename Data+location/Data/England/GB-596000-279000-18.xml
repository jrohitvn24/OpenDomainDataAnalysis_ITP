		<title>18THATCHING, HOPTON</title>
		<content> Many roofs in this area are thatched. 
 In Norfolk, reed (rye and wheat can be
 used) is usually used. Damp straw is  
 gathered together in yealms 18ins.    
 wide and 5ins. deep and laid in a     
 y-shaped yoke (large end forward),    
 then overlapped and pegged down with  
 staple-like hazel spars. Loose straw  
 is raked out.  Batterns are fixed     
 across the rafters at intervals of 5, 
 9 and finally 2ins from the vertical  
 board starting at the bottom.  Flat   
 thatching is covered by roofing and   
 the yealms are bent and secured.  A   
 pattern can be cut. Lastly the eaves  
 are cut level at the bottom.  This is 
 used on roofs pitched at least 50     
 degrees (so the rain will run off)    
 where rafters overhang the walls.     
 Thatched roofs last about 20 years and
 are costly to insure as they are high 
 fire risks, but are very attractive.  </content>
