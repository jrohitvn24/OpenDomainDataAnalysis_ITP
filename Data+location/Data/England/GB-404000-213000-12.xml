		<title>12CHEDWORTH ROMAN VILLA  -PAST</title>
		<content>     The best known feature in the area
 is the{Roman Villa.}Started about A.D.
 120,  after  much  rebuilding  it  was
 abandoned in the late 4th. century.The
 latest coins have been dated A.D. 383.
     Although  Chedworth  is  the  most
 clearly  visible,  there are  26 other
 villas  near  by  with 6 or 7 within 4
 kms. In common it occupies a sheltered
 site,  near  a water supply and around
 the 150-200 metre contour height.     
     The{ Salt  Way }from Droitwich  to
 Cirencester  passed close to the  site
 and  a  short easy journey by track to
 the  Fosse Way led to the large  Roman
 settlement of Corinium _ Cirencester _
 for trade, business and pleasure.     
      First   excavated  in   1864/1865
 sheds  were  built over the remains to
 protect them.  Less wise was the house
 that now prevents full appreciation of
 the{villa's secluded location.        </content>
