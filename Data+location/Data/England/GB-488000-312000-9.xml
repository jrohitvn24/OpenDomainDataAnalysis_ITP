		<content> At Manor Farm Mr.Hollis has 500       
 breeding sheep and 800 lambs.He has   
 one sheep dog called Bob who is eight 
 years old and he leads the sheep to   
 where Mr.Hollis wants them.There are  
 nine tractors on the farm and one of  
 the wheels was bigger than me.        
 Mr. Hollis showed us a sheep that had 
 magots in its wool,then he let us     
 watch the sheep being dipped.He must  
 dip them between 29 May and 2 July and
 the sheep do not like it,the water was
 green.Four or five sheep can be dipped
 at once, but they must be in for a    
 minute.                               
   Mr. Hollis grows barley,rape,oats,  
 wheat,hay and grass for silage.He     
 mixes grass and molasses to make      
 silage to give  the sheep in winter.  
 He also keeps 60 beef cattle and a few
 horses.The Manor Farm house is over   
 200 years old.                        </content>
