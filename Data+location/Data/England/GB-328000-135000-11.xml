 Every year the river Parrett will     
 flood so somebody has to do something 
 about it. The Wessex Water Authority  
 send people to make walls of mud,     
 taken from the river bank, so that the
 water doesn't overflow. Two children  
 interviewed one of the men making the 
 mud walls. He told them that in spring
 the water will come up to about six   
 inches from the top of the bank. In   
 summer the depth of the river varies  
 from six inches at low tide to ten    
 feet at high tide and in the winter   
 from four feet to fifteen feet. At    
 Moorland the river flows only a few   
 yards from some of the houses. If the 
 mud walls were not rebuilt every year 
 there would be great danger of        
 flooding.
