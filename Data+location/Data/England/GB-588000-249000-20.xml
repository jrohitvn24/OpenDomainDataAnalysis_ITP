		<content>Alpheton is situated on either side of 
the A134 Sudbury to Bury St Edmunds    
road,about 6km North East of Long      
Melford and approximately 5km West of  
Lavenham.The village is divided into   
two sections by the A134,the larger    
part to the east of the main road and  
including 37 houses,the Jubilee village
hall,public telephone kiosk and post   
box.Although the larger part is to the 
east it is not the busiest because the 
smaller western area is built around a 
thriving petrol station and cafe which 
are situated on a bend of the old road 
now used as a lay-by.The area around   
Alpheton is rolling open farmland and  
the majority of Alpheton's 245         
inhabitants must either work on the    
land or in nearby towns.
