		<content>   The transmitting station and 450    
 foot mast at{Rowridge}were built in   
 1954 to transmit all the BBC's FM     
 radio and TV programmes, the          
 Independent channels being susequently
 broadcast from the nearbye Chillerton 
 Down transmitter. Two years ago,      
 however, Rowridge took over all ITV   
 programmes as well.                   
   The station gets its signals from   
 the Post Office Tower via British     
 Telecom, but if the signal breaks down
 then it is relayed from the BBC's     
 Crystal Palace transmitter via        
 intermediate stations.                
  {Originally the station was manned   
{round the clock by twelve engineers on
{a shift system. Today the station is  
{largely automated and is manned in    
{normal working hours by three         
{engineers and a part time secretary.}
