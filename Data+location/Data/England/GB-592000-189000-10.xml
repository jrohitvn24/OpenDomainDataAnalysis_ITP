		<title>10THE BALLET SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The Ballet School, run by Mrs.Prime   
 was opened in 1977.It uses the old    
 primary school which was built in 1868
 When the dancers are sixteen they     
 leave the Ballet School to go on to   
 full time training.Here are some of   
 the professional schools they go to.  
 The Royal Ballet School, the Bush     
 Davies School and the Laine Theatre   
 Arts School.The Ballet School puts on 
 a show every year. On average there   
 are  235 dancers who take part. The   
 dancers take I.S.T.D.and R.A.D Ballet 
 exams and I.S.T.D. tap and modern.    
 Lessons cost 70p for babies, 80p for  
 juniors and Â£1 for seniors. Each year 
 dancing schools compete for medals and
 cups at the Leigh Festival. Our school
 always does well in the competitions. 
 There are 238 dancers but only 7 boys.
 Most of the dancers come from Thorpe  
 Bay.                                  </content>
