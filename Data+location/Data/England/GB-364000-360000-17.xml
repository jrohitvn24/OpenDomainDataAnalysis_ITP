		<content> With effect from 1985, the Common     
 Market introduced a restriction on    
 milk production and each farmer was   
 given a{quota}which entailed a        
 reduction in output. So now more beef 
 cattle are being reared at the expense
 of the dairy cows. Depending on       
 requirements, artificial insemination 
 is used by the farmers, half dairy and
 half beef bulls being used. Animals   
 are sold at Crewe and Beeston Markets.
{PIGS}10 sows for breeding purposes.   
{SHEEP}In winter some farmers receive  
 sheep from upland areas, to make use  
 of surplus grass when the ground would
 be damaged by cattle.                 
{POULTRY}Between two farms there are   
 200 free range and 6000 battery hens. 
 The free range eggs are sold from the 
 farm and to a health food shop. The   
 battery eggs go to the Egg Marketing  
 Board.                                </content>
