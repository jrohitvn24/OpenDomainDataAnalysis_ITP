		<content> A survey revealed that many people do 
 craft activities at home. Apart from  
 sheer enjoyment it also has a         
 practical side because items often    
 made are useful in everyday life. Most
 popular are knitting and sewing. Time 
 spent on these crafts each week       
 varies, but mostly falls between 1-5  
 hours.                                
 People seem to have originally learnt 
 their craft pastimes from relatives   
 at home, or at school, initially      
 between the ages of 8-14. Only a few  
 people had learnt from books.         
 Crafts found were Chinese brush       
 painting, cane seating, flower        
 arranging, Jewellery and lace making, 
 pottery, woodwork, metalwork, dress   
 making and tailoring.
