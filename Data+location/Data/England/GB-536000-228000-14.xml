		<content> Robert, Nathan and I went to a farm in
 Throcking it is called "W M Lower     
 Farm".                                
 It is quite a large farm - about 500  
 acres.It has 3,000 hens and about 2_3 
 hundred pheasant chicks. The pheasants
 chicks will be let loose for          
 shooting.It also has 48 cattle.These  
 cattle are three breeds:              
 Belted Galloway,Charolais,Ayrshire. To
 milk his cattle Mr.Murchie uses a     
 modern milking machine.Altogether the 
 cows give 461 litres per day.         
 Mr.Murchie also grows crops.He grows  
 Wheat,Barley,Oats,Rape and grass for  
 silage.                               
 We asked Mr.Murchie his fuel          
 consumption.                          
 He said about 3gls per hr per         
 vehicle.
