		<title>02Brick making in Fletton - 1.</title>
		<content>   On Wednesday, all the girls in our  
 class got in the minibus to go the the
 local London Brick Company (L.B.C.)   
 works.  Our local works is called     
 Beeby's and there are quite a few     
 brickyards in our region.  When we    
 arrived we were met by Mr. Harviss and
 Mr. Furr who then gave us a guided    
 tour.                                 
   The first thing that we saw was the 
 long snake-like conveyor belt which   
 carried enormous lumps of clay all the
 way to the works from the quarry,     
 where, in the distance we could see   
 the excavator, or 'navvy', with its   
 huge jaws eating into the freshly     
 revealed  deposits of clay.           
   Then we wre taken to the building   
 where the clay was first of all       
 crushed.  After this crushing by huge 
 metal rollers, it travelled by        
 conveyor belt to the separator.       </content>
