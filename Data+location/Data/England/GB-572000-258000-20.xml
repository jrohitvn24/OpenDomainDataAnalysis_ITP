		<content> The landscape in this small part of   
 Suffolk is fairly typical of the rest 
 of the county. The undulating         
 countryside is mainly arable, vast    
 fields under cultivation worked by    
 modern machinery, the farms only      
 employing a few labourers. The whole  
 scene gives an impression of good     
 husbandry, well kept verges, stout    
 gates and well maintained properous   
 farm houses. Mnay of the hedges have  
 disappeared to accommodate the        
 machinery and to make full use of the 
 land. However small copses have been  
 left for natural habitats for         
 pheasants and other game. One of the  
 biggest controversies this decade is  
 the burning of the useless straw, with
 the attendant risks of fire and the   
 spread of soot and ash. Most farmers  
 however are caring members of the     
 community anxious to preserve the area</content>
