		<title>19THE SHRAWLEY POSTMAN</title>
		<content> Mr.Wilcox or 'Wally' as he is known to
 everyone has lived in the village for 
 over seventy years. For the last      
 sixteen years he has been the village 
 postman. His day begins at 4.45a.m.   
 and after a cup of tea he leaves home 
 at 5.30a.m. He goes to Holt Heath to  
 sort the mail before starting on his  
 rounds. He delivers down Shrawley Road
 as far as Wolstan's Farm and The      
 Monastery, 20-25 miles each day.He is 
 given breakfast at The Monastery each 
 day probably in return for his help in
 delivering their milk and papers.He is
 amazed at some of the things now sent 
 by post such as an 8-10ft ladder,a    
 bicycle or a greenhouse, which he is  
 supposed to deliver on a bicycle. His 
 longest days are at Christmas time    
 when he finishes work at 3 p.m.He has 
 earned the respect of the local dogs  
 by carrying biscuits in his pocket.   </content>
