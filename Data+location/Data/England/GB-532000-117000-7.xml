		<title>07Brownie Pack, Burgess Hill</title>
		<content> The Brownies were founded in 1910 by  
 Lord Baden Powell.  When girls are 7  
 years old they can join a group called
 the Brownies .  Our group is called   
 the 8th Burgess Hill (St Andrew's)    
 pack.  The pack is divided into small 
 groups called "sixes".  These are     
 usually called by Fairy Brownie names.
 Our sixes are called Gnomes, Elves,   
 Imps and Sprites.  Brownies make a    
 promise when they get enrolled.  The  
 promise is, "I promise that I'll do my
 best to do my duty to God, to serve   
 the Queen and help other people and to
 keep the Brownie Guide law."  The law 
 is, "A Brownie guide thinks of others 
 before herself and does a good turn   
 every day".  In our country we wear a 
 brown dress with a yellow tie and a   
 brown woollen hat. This year Brownies 
 are celebrating the 75 anniversary.
