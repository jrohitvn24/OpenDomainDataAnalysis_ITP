		<content> Our interviewee thinks farming is all 
 hustle and bustle these days and from 
 his scullery window, that's certainly 
 how it seems. Tractors, combine       
 harvesters, then grain lorries and    
 next the "sugar beet run"-it certainly
 seems to be a hive of activity in the 
 farmyard across the road. It's less   
 busy of course in the depths of winter
 and in January this year, almost      
 everything came to a standstill with  
 the farm and cottages being cut off by
 snow for the best part of a week. They
 are very self-sufficient. He takes his
 wife to work and to the "big"         
 supermarket for late night shopping on
 Wednesday. They can fill the boot of  
 the car provided by the people  for   
 whom he gardens.
