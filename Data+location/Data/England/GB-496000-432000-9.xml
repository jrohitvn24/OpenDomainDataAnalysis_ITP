		<content>  Although the roads to and from Little
 Weighton are in good condition,       
 because we have some of the highest   
 roads in the area, they can be        
 difficult in winter because of snow.  
 This is awkward for many people       
 because they have to travel out of the
 village to go to work or to the       
 secondary school at Cottingham.       
  There is a 30mph speed limit in the  
 village itself but we do not have a   
 lot of traffic passing through. In 10 
 minutes we counted 33 cars and        
 lorries, but not all of these were    
 passing through, some were local      
 people driving to the shops and back  
 home again.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
