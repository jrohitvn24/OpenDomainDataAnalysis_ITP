		<content> We discovered that there are three    
 stories of the supernatural in our    
 locality. In Dingwood Park there is   
 reputed to be an old grey lady who    
 wanders about. At Brookend the Red    
 Earl, who was reputed to have been a  
 Bishop of Gloucester, wanders around  
 one end of the house. There is a      
 connection here with the Red Earl's   
 Dyke on Raggedstone Hill. The curse of
 Raggedstone Hill is an ancient legend 
 about a monk from Little Malvern      
 Priory, who against his vows of       
 chastity fell in love with a young    
 girl. The prior ordered him to crawl  
 to the top of the hill on his hands   
 and knees. One day when he reached the
 top he did not pray, but cursed the   
 hill and anyone on whom the shadow of 
 the hill should fall. Among those who 
 suffered are reputed to be Cardinal   
 Wolsey and William Huskisson, M.P.    </content>
