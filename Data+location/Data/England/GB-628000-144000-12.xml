		<title>12The Dover Motel</title>
		<content>Opened in November 1978 and is a direct
result of the decision to build a      
by-pass. It is the joint venture of    
Townsend Thoreson Ferries and Hammonds 
garage. The motel is situated 2 miles  
from Dover and built on land adjoining 
the by-pass.                           
The motel provides a 24 hour service   
and accomodation for about 200 guests. 
Most people stay for one night only and
51% are British.                       
The busiest period is June to September
each year. The motel gives employment  
to about 78 people and jobs include    
receptionist, restaurant supervisor,   
kitchen stewards, gardeners, porters   
and accoutants. The restaurant provides
top quality formal meals and the cafe  
serves snacks or full meals on a more  
informal basis from 1000 to 2300 hours 
daily.
