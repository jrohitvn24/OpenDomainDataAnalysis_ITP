		<title>07Transport Around Sharnbrook</title>
		<content> Most families in Sharnbrook own one or
 two cars, so do not rely heavily on   
{public transport.}Two local employers 
{(Odell leather, and Unilever)}provide 
 transport for their workers. There is 
 an hourly weekday bus service to      
 Bedford, with an extra bus at 08.15   
 for people travelling to work. It is  
 impossible to travel by bus to Rushden
 and arrive in time for work. For      
 longer journeys it is necessary to go 
 to Bedford and catch a bus or train.  
 The main St. Pancras to the North line
 passes through the village, but the   
{station,}opened in 1857, was{closed in
{May 1960.}A number of people indicated
 that they would like the station      
 re_opened. Several people travel daily
 to London, catching the train in      
 Bedford. They would welcome the       
 convenience of a local station.
