		<title>03EAST HADDON A POETIC VIEW</title>
		<content>The church,big and old,                
Standing motionless and quiet,         
Surrounded by a green field            
Everything is quiet and still          
Only broken by the monsters that roar  
                      along the road   
Orangey brown buildings tower above me 
Many times bigger                      
The one small shop shuts               
Evening draws on,                      
The illuminated building opens,        
The humans call it the pub,            
Early morning comes bringing light     
Children go to school                  
The village all on its own             
Surrounded by fields and farms         
In the midlands,                       
The village East Haddon                
ME? I am a mouse.
