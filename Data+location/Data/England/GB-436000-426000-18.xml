		<title>18Mosquitoes In Woodlesford</title>
		<content> Residents of Woodlesford have been    
 complaining about mosquito bites since
 1970 when a particulary dangerous     
 species "Aedes Detritus" was found in 
 the area.Many people have suffered    
 every year,last summer was            
 particularly bad and a working party  
 of the Environmental Health Department
 is investigating the problem.They were
 breeding on an area of marshy land at 
 Oulton including the site of the      
 Whitbread brewery at Ethaldwell.The   
 first outbreak of mosquitoes caused   
 severe swelling,In one case it was so 
 bad that a man has dug up garden and  
 put concrete paving stones down and   
 installed double glazing.Even the     
 man's relatives won't visit him incase
 of being bitten by a mosquito. The    
 only way to get rid of them is to pour
 oil on their eggs.
