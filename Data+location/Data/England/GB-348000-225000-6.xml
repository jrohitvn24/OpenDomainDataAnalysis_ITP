		<content> Ecology -  Conservation &amp; Farming.    
      In this block farmng has not made
 such an impact on the land as further 
 east.  Most farmers consider that they
 have not needed to greatly increase   
 the amount of natural or artifical    
 fertilisers or pesticides in the lst  
 few years.  Some soil washoff has     
 occurred in sloping fields ploughed   
 for winter.                           
      Hedges have been retained, with  
 some woodland &amp; scrub as wildlife     
 corners but no new hedges or trees    
 have been planted except for          
 lane-edges or field windbreaks.  Old  
 farm ponds have been mostly kept and  
 improved with some new ones made.     
      Many farms have old stone barns, 
 most are well looked after and should 
 provide good summer roosts for bats,  
 and perhaps winter roosts also.
