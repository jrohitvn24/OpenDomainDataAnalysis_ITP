		<title>17WEST MONKTON VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content>  The origional village hall was built 
 after the second world war, and was   
 used as an army hut. It was a small   
 metal and wood building,known as the  
 Victory Village Hall.                 
  In 1977,the year of the Queen's jub- 
 ilee,the local people wanted to build 
 a new village hall. They had lots of  
 fund raising events.The new village   
 hall was eventually built.The people  
 in the village wanted to keep the old 
 name, but it was made for the jubilee,
 so finally they called it The Victory 
 Jubilee Village Hall.                 
  Now it is the centre of village life.
 Drama productions,toddler and mother  
 groups,youth club,yoga and badminton  
 clubs all take place in the hall.     
  The hall can be hired out when it is 
 free,especially Saturday nights.Wedd- 
 ing parties and reunions have been    
 held there.                           </content>
