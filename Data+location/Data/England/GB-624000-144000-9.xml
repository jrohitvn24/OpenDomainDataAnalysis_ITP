		<content>The Ministry of Defence owns much land 
in the area.It is used for both night  
time and daytime exercises.Some local  
children enjoy their contact with the  
army.This account is by one of the     
local boys.                            
My spare time is mainly spent on       
outdoor activities.I enjoy camping and 
going on hikes.I love the army,in      
fact,I am infatuated with the army.The 
army train in Lydden so I go looking   
for discarded military equipment.I go  
with the army when they dig trenches,  
make their camps and go on hikes.I get 
dressed up in my army gear and play    
war.My friend and I imitate what the   
army does.We make camps in bushes and  
I sometimes go to the army bunkers on  
Lydden hill.My friends and I go camping
with the army equipment we own.I love  
going camping because the area is so   
beautiful.                             </content>
