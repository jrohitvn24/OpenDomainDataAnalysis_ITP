		<content>{Playground games-}"Tick" is a game in 
 which 2 or more people can play. One  
 person is on, this means that that    
 person has to {Tick}(touch) another   
 person who is then on, and he then has
 to {Tick} a different person. This    
 continues until we finish playing it  
 at the end of playtime. The person who
 is on when we finish has lost. I      
 usually play it with Peter, Michael   
 and some other friends. Sometimes we  
 play it on the climbing frames to make
 it harder. It is harder because you   
 can't move very fast on the climbing  
 frames. {Rounders}is a game we play at
 playtime. You have 4  posts,at each   
 post there is a person. There are 2   
 teams,1 team {bats}and the 2nd team{  
{fields}. When the batter hits the ball
 they run to 1st post and if they get  
 to 4th post they get a {rounder}.
