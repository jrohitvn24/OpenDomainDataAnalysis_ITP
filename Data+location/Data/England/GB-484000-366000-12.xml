 dwellings.There were 230 detached     
 bungalows,21 semi-detached bungalows, 
 98 detached houses,52 semi-detached   
 houses,and 18 terraced houses.        
   At one time the bricks were made    
 loaclly. Traces of the site can be    
 seen behind the 'eight-row'on the     
 north boundary of the parish.In later 
 times the bricks came from Lincoln and
 almost all of them are now obtained   
 from Peterborough.                    
   Eagle is served by five local       
 businesses, a garage , an electrical  
 shop, a butcher'shop and a post
