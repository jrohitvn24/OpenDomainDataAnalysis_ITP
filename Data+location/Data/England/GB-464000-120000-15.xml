		<content> As East Meon is such a small village  
 my roles as Councillor and School     
 Governor are not very ardous.I am     
 available for the villagers to come   
 and put forward their grievances      
 particularly where footpaths are      
 concerned as this is my               
 responsibility.Landowners seem to be  
 keen to close footpath in order to    
 protect their crops from being        
 trampled on and neglecting and        
 maintaining bridleways and stiles.As  
 an extremely new member on the Board  
 of School Governors I have attended   
 three meetings.My role so far has been
 to support the Headmaster and listen  
 to his recommendations and forward    
 them where necessary to the Education 
 Authorities through our Chairman.     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
