		<title>14WILDLIFE IN THE GREAT PARK</title>
		<content>   Together with the New Forest,       
 Windsor Great Park has the widest     
 range of wild life of any area in     
 England.  There are 2,000 different   
 species of beetle alone and many other
 insects are found there.  The Nature  
 Conservancy Board have designated much
 of this region as an area of special  
 scientfic interest.  None of the trees
 can be moved, even when they have     
 fallen down, because this could       
 destroy a whole species.              
   There are many rabbits and foxes,   
 but few badgers now.  A corner of the 
 deer park is in this area.            
   Blackbirds, song and mistle thrushes
 are here all the year; redwings and   
 fieldfares visit in winter.  Canada   
 geese, mandarin duck and the great    
 crested grebe live on ponds in the    
 Park.  Occasionally a tawny owl can be
 seen.                                 </content>
