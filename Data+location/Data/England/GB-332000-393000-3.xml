		<content>  {60%}of the people in our area are   
{employed.}My mum and dad are both     
{unemployed}but my best friend's dad is
 a publican. The types of jobs some    
 parents have in our school are:       
 builder, cleaner, taxi driver and a   
 computer programmer.{68%}of the       
{employed}parents are "blue collar"    
 workers (manual),{20%}service industry
 workers (bus driver) and{12%}are      
 "white collar" workers (bank clerk).  
 Sometimes people who are{employed}go  
 on strike because they think that they
 do not get enough pay. However most   
 people are very thankful that they    
 have got a job and never go on strike.
