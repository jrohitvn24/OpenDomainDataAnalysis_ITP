		<content> The most usual farm buildings to be   
 found were a milking parlour, a cow   
 house and a cubicle house.            
 MILK COLLECTION                       
 Up to 5 years ago a lorry came round  
 the farms collecting milk cans every  
 morning.  On handing over 2 full cans 
 of milk to the milkman 2 empty cans   
 would be given in exchange. Today,    
 however a milk tanker comes daily to  
 collect the milk is kept fresh and    
 cool and is then taken into Harrogate.
 FISH FARMING                          
 The Glasshouses Fish Farm began in    
 1985:there are 260,000  fish in six   
 tanks and a large canal in which to   
 hold the fish that are ready to be    
 sold.                                 
 A similar farm at Low Laithe breeds   
 their own fish and has one large      
 tank in which there are  about 130,000
 fish.                                 </content>
