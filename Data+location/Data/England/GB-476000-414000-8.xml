		<title>08FARMING IN NORTH AXHOLME.</title>
		<content>     Although there is{some light      
{industry}in the Isle of Axholme, the  
 main feature of this area is its      
{Agriculture.}This particular block is,
 in many ways typical of agricultural  
{North Lincolnshire}(or South          
 Humberside, as the region is presently
 known), but it does have some unique  
 features of its own.                  
     For a start, the land is far      
{flatter}than land further South. This 
 is due to the fact that the land is   
 reclaimed marshland. Consequently the 
 land is{rich arable land}and mostly   
 given up to a cycle of crops which    
 nowadays includes{oilseed rape.}Of the
 six farms in this block, only Cottage 
 Farm (owned by Mr Charlie Morgan)     
 raises cattle: a herd of French       
 Cherolet beef cattle. Crops grown also
 include{wheat, oats, barley, sugar    
{beat, peas and potatoes.              </content>
