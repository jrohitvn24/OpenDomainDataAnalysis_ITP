		<content> On{Saturdays,}after waking at ten, I  
 help dad cook boiled eggs for         
 breakfast before watching T.V..After  
 washing and dressing I tidy my room   
 and make my bed which is quite easy as
 I have a duvet quilt.Following a      
 sandwich snack lunch in front of the  
 T.V.,mum and I travel by car into town
 and do the family shopping mainly at  
 Tesco's superstore, stopping for a    
 drink at a coffee bar. Returning home,
 we put the food away in the freezer,  
 fridge and cupboards. By now it is tea
 time and I lay the table for our      
 cooked meal.After tea I help mum with 
 the housework.We then change to go to 
 the cricket club where my dad is      
 playing.I have a drink of coca-cola in
 the clubhouse.We return home at about 
 ten o'clock and by the time we arrive 
 I am ready for my bed.
