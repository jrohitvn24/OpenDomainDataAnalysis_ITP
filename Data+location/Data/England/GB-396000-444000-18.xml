		<title>18COWLING HILL</title>
		<content>   The name Cowling suggests a Saxon   
 settlement. Around 560 AD a family    
 named'Coll' settled in the area and   
 'inge' means home hence the name      
 Collinge as Cowling used to be known. 
   During the Norman time land was     
 given to the Emmott brothers as a     
 reward for their services to William  
 the Conqueror.A settlement developed  
 with Cowling Hill as its centre.      
   There was little arable land in 1086
 due to high,uncleared land.           
 Reclamation took place in the 16th    
 century.Farms were built between 1280 
 and 1580.                             
   Cowling Hill's importance is        
 illustrated by the Chapel as a number 
 of roads converge here.               
   The present Carr Head Hall is not   
 the original building but was built in
 1851.The estate covers about 56 acres.
