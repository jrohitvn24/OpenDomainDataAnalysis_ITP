		<content> Serving the town and surrounding      
 inhabitants of Maghull there are 7    
 churches, excluding those in the areas
 of Melling and Aintree.  They all     
 cater not only for worship but also as
 a centre for involvement of the       
 parishioners in various societies and 
 social functions.  Our school, St.    
 George's R.C., caters for members of  
 the Polish community who first arrived
 during World War 2 and now have a mass
 said in Polish every Sunday in the    
 school hall.                          
 The oldest church and the oldest      
 building of any note is the chapel    
 located in the grounds of St.Andrew's 
 Parish Church and is believed to be   
 700 years old and was mentioned in the
 original Domesday Book. An inscription
 relating to its insertion is to be    
 found in Latin in one of the walls.
