		<title>01SOUTHERN FOREST OF DEAN</title>
		<content>   The 12 sq.km. grid lies to the south
 of the Forest of Dean. Most of this   
 land, comprising  hills and valleys,  
 is covered by woodlands (coniferous   
 and deciduous) and is worked by the   
 Forestry Commission. To the east of   
 the grid is mainly farmland together  
 with an area used for growing fruit.  
 To the south of the grid the land     
 drops steeply to almost sea-level     
 height towards the River Severn. Here 
 are found the residential areas both  
 on the hillsides and in the valleys.  
   This area has little industry apart 
 from forestry and only two of the     
 roads are served by bus services.     
   When walking along forest paths one 
 can see many disused quarries and     
 small drift mines which were worked   
 earlier this century. The area's      
 history dates from pre-Roman times and
 is renowned for its natural beauty.   </content>
