		<content>    The Borough of Accrington is       
pleasantly situated among a ring of    
encircling hills.Which give it shelter 
and at the same time help to           
precipitate the rainfall and also give 
rise to the numerous streams whice     
course down the hillsides and through  
the local cloughs.                     
    These streams however have been cut
down through the deposits of glacial   
drift and eaten into the native rocks  
with the result that where sandstones  
overbying shales have been encountered 
harming waterfalls have been formed as 
a result of the superior durabiliting  
by the sandstones.This is well seen in 
Warmden Clough at the fall known as the
great arc where a little gorge has been
cut through the Great Arc Sandstone by 
the recesion of the waterfall face.The 
highest point in our block is Great    
Hameldon with the height of 409 metres.</content>
