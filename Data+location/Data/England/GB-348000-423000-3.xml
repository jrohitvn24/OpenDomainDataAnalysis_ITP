		<title>03LONGTON'S TRADE AND SHOPPING</title>
		<content>     The shops in this block are mainly
 one man owned shops. The various      
 families have owned the shops for many
 years although the premises have been 
 altered or rebuilt. When Longton was  
 beginning to grow, in the 1960's, most
 of the shops were in converted houses 
 or wooden sheds. The{plumber}had his  
 base in a wooden garage behind his    
 house, the{electrician}had a wooden   
 shed full of fridges, television sets 
 and radiators. The{shoe shop}is the   
 only business still trading from a    
 wooden building and the insurance for 
 this is almost prohibitively high.    
 There is now a unit of shops, purpose 
 built in the village centre, which    
 includes a bank and shops, with       
 offices and service shops on the upper
 storey.                               
    The{Post Office}is still in a      
 converted house with a live in family.</content>
