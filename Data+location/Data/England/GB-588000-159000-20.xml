		<title>20RECREATION FETE TUNSTALL</title>
		<content>The Tunstall summer fete is an annual  
event.It is held in June or July in the
school grounds and on the lawn of the  
oast house.There are lots of stalls and
all the money raised goes either to the
primary school fund or towards         
restoring the parish church.In past    
years the fete has raised between four 
and five hundred pounds.Some stalls    
require a degree of skill such as      
throwing golf balls into numbered      
tubes;the highest score of the day     
being the winner.This stall was called 
"Down the Drain".A number of raffles   
are also organised and it is possible  
to win anything from food and drink to 
teddy bears.The Westlands School Band  
plays for most of the day,and Fourth   
Year pupils from Tunstall Primary      
School perform dances round the        
maypole.
