		<title>18Entertainment in Bilston</title>
		<content>Entertainment in the area is limited as
there is no longer a cinema or theatre.
Many townsfolk visit the local Bingo   
Hall. Dancing,for both young and old,  
is often held in local schools and     
community halls. "Black Country"       
evenings are a regular entertainment   
for the locality. These evenings       
consist of traditional food like grey  
peas, peas pudding,black pudding,      
faggots, and of course,beer. Comedians 
tell stories and jokes about typical   
"Black Country" people, particularly   
"Aynuk" and "Ali". Churches and places 
of Religion also provide places where  
people can meet socially. Near to      
the centre of Bilston are Holy Trinity 
R.C. Church, St.Mary's and St.Leonards 
C of E Churches, The Methodist Church, 
Baptist Church and Sihk Temple.        
Activities include Mothers &amp; Toddlers, 
Senior Citizens &amp; Uniformed Groups.    </content>
