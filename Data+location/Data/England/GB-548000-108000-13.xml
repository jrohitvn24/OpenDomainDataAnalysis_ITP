		<title>13Housing in Ripe</title>
		<content>      There are approximately 100      
 houses in Ripe and the part of        
 Chalvington included in this block.   
 They are mostly owner occupied apart  
 from a few which are rented privately 
 or by the council and two or three    
 tied cottages. Most of the farms are  
 run by the owners with help from farm 
 workers who find their own            
 accommodation. Houses in this area are
 expensive so to afford to live here   
 the house owner usually has to        
 commute to well paid work in town.    
 There are many old farm houses and    
 other attractive properties in the    
 upper income bracket. Also farm       
 labourers cottages built mainly in the
 19th C. have been modernised and make 
 good family homes. In the last 20     
 years the County policy has been to   
 limit builing and only ten new houses 
 have been built.                      </content>
