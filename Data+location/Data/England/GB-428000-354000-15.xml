		<title>15Jobs in Cromford</title>
		<content> We made a survey of parents' jobs in  
 Cromford .We found that for Dads' jobs
 the third most common was{Office      
{Worker}with three examples,the second 
 most common was{Builders}with five but
 by far the most common occupation was 
 that of{Lorry drivers}with ten        
 examples . We think this is because   
 there are so many quarries locally.   
 Surprisingly only three Dads were     
{un_employed.}For women we put         
 part_time and full time together.{Shop
{Owners}were the third most common with
 four examples,second came{teachers    
 with six and most comman of all was   
{cleaners}with eleven!
