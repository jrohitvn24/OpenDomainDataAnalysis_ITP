 Across from our school there are some 
 bungalows where the old people live.  
{Rachel,Claire,Tracy}and I went to{Mr  
 and{Mrs Page's}bungalow to ask what   
 the area used to be like. She told us 
 a lot of interesting things. They told
 us that all of{High Wycombe}used to be
 fields and Cherry orchards and there  
 used to be a farm called{Kipples Farm 
 along Hatters Lane.There were no roads
 or hardly any houses.{Mr and Mrs Page 
 have lived in this area for about{80  
 years.Then we went to{Mrs Goss}and she
 told us that she would not live       
 anywhere else but{High Wycombe}and she
 has lived in the area for{70 years.   
 She told us that when she was{young   
 the area was once all{grassland}and   
{woods.}It was{lovely.}She also told us
 that there weren't many{houses}around 
 this{area.                            </content>
