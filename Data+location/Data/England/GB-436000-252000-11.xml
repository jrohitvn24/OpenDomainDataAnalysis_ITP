 Play Group is a place where children  
 aged four and under go to meet up with
 friends.It also prepares them to share
 things and to get used to being with  
 other children. At Play Group they    
 play with sand and water and they play
 going down a slide and going through a
 tunnel.They paint and they play with  
 each other as well. Also children go  
 there to get friendly with other      
 children so they will know each other 
 when they go to  school.
