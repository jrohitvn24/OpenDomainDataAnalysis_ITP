 The village shop first opened in 1934 
 and was run by Mrs. Lily Manders from 
 1936 till 1978. It was closed for 1.5 
 years, it has been run by Mrs. Dale-  
 Evans since 1980.  The Post- Office   
 opened in 1982.  Mrs. Dale-Evans      
 sells fresh and frozen food including 
 local vegetables, household cleaning  
 and first aid materials.  The average 
 price spent is 27p. As well as        
 working in the shop, she gives people 
 directions and tells people when the  
 next bus is due.                      
 It was proposed in 1950 that there    
 should be a Sub-Post Office in the    
 Rettendon school area, but this was   
 not opened until 1982.  The shop is   
 known as 'Oakdene Stores'.
