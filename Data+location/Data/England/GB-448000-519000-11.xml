		<title>11A DAY IN MY LIFE 1</title>
		<content>    On the morning Grandma gets up at  
 seven a.m.and wakes me up too.For half
 an hour i read my reading book ,i then
 wash my face and get changed.I then   
 brush my hair well because it gets    
 tangled during the night.Afterwards i 
 go downstairs where breakfast is      
 ready.I eat my breakfast,and insist   
 that i should wash the dishes.After i 
 have finshed i put on my jacket and   
 wait for Farhat to call for me.when   
 she arrives we both walk to school    
 together.                             
    Today it is Wednesday and we read  
 our reading books for half an hour and
 then we do our sentences or story.    
 When we have finished we do           
 Passwords.At 10.30 we go out to play, 
 and I play with my friends.           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
