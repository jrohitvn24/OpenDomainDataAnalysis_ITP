		<title>18SUTTON MILL</title>
		<content> One of the most important features of 
 the village is Sutton Mill. This was a
 corn mill which was built in 1789 and 
 ceased operating in 1940 after being  
 struck by lightning. It was bought a  
 few years ago by Mr Nunn. With his    
 family he is carefully restoring it.  
 He hopes to have the mill fully       
 operational again. This year he fitted
 a new cap and stocks. The mill is the 
 tallest in the country and can be seen
 from miles around. It is open to the  
 public during the summer. The view    
 from the top is impressive. Several   
 village churches and the coastal dunes
 are visible. On a clear day Yarmouth  
 can be seen. Mr Nunn has also opened a
 small museum at the foot of the mill. 
 The mill is popular with local school 
 children and visitors to Broadland.
