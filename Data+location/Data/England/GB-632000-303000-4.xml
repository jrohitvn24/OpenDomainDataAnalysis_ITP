		<content> The young say they need more          
 entertaining amenities as they say    
 that they get bored whereas the       
 elderly say they prefer the village as
 it is with a small shop,hairdresser   
 and Public_house;quiet and            
 unhurried.The middle age group of the 
 community have a better and more      
 varied array of clubs and activities  
 than children and youngsters,and the  
 elderly have hardly anything.A vareity
 of watersports take place on the river
 and Rockland Broad,such as canoeing   
 and fishing and also there is a       
 private boating club.A number of      
 pastimes can be persued in the village
 hall and also at nearby Claxton.These 
 include darts,tabletennis and pool and
 the local play group,Brownies and     
 Guides are housed here.
