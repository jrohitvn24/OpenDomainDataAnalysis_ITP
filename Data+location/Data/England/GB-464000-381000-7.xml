		<title>07RANBY VILLAGE SCHOOL</title>
		<content>    Ranby has had its own school since 
 1836. (That of Babworth dates back to 
 1794). It was built by John Rogers    
 Esq., of Ranby House. Subsequently the
 property passed to the Dukes of       
 Newcastle, the managers paying Â£8.50 a
 year in rent. In the early days the   
 schoolmistress received Â£35 p.a. with 
 house and coals.                      
    The managers accepted controlled   
 status in 1951, and a new school was  
 erected in 1964 at a cost of Â£15000.  
    Today there are 30 pupils, aged 5  
 to 11. Of these only 5 come from the  
 village, the rest travelling from the 
 farms. They are taught by a           
 headmaster, one full-time and one     
 part-time teacher.
