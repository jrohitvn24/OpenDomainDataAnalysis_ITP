		<content> Within a few miles of our school,     
 Broadbent Fold C.P, there are examples
 of the variety of schools provided by 
 Tameside Education Authority.         
 Dukinfield High School, which has been
 a comprehensive school for only 4/5   
 years, is the only Senior School in   
 the immediate area. It is on two      
 sites, and has over 900 pupils. Next  
 door is Yew Tree Community school,    
 which not only provides community     
 activities in after-school hours, but 
 also houses a Nursery and an E.S.N.   
 Unit. Just round the corner is St.    
 Mary's Primary school, which is Roman 
 Catholic, and gives preference to     
 children from Catholic homes. (Their  
 Senior School, All Saints, is just    
 outside our area.) Our own school     
 serves a private housing estate, high 
 on Hough Hill, with tremendous views  
 over the whole of Manchester.         </content>
