		<title>09Farming.Hoo area.</title>
		<content> The area is chiefly devoted to arable 
farming-cereals (wheat) being the main 
crop.A variety of "break" crops are    
grown,the main ones being oilseed rape 
and sugarbeet, with peas and beans for 
freezing and potatoes.                 
 There is more than average grassland  
acreage along the Upper Deben Valley &amp; 
this supports 4 Dairy herds,averageing 
150 cows each.Grass is grazed &amp; cut for
hay and some maize is grown for        
sileage.                               
 Farm buildings have generally been    
adapted to house implements or turned  
into grain stores.Pigs now are housed  
in specialist buildings as are poultry.
There are two poultry enterprises and  
one pig unit in the area.
