		<content> Stanford le Hope is a small settlement
 located just north of the R.Thames,   
 some 28 miles from London, in the     
 borough of Thurrock. The 1981 Census  
 recorded a population of 10,609,an    
 increase of 3% from 1971. Recent      
 housing developments have virtually   
 joined Stanford to its neighbour,     
 Corringham.                           
   To the east of Stanford, on what was
 once marshland, are two large oil     
 refineries, Shell Haven and Coryton.  
 Between Stanford and these refineries 
 is a narrow belt of farmland about 1km
 wide.                                 
   To the south is a large area of sand
 and gravel workings,partly reclaimed  
 for recreational purposes,partly      
 actively worked and partly undergoing 
 refill with refuse carried down the   
 Thames from London by barge.
