		<title>18TRAFFIC SURVEY</title>
		<content> Lundwood in 1955 was a mixture of     
 three things, roads, canals and       
 railways.  There was only one long    
 canal no that shows the canals were   
 being pushed out and railways and     
 trains taking canals place, but still 
 the cars and lorries etc were becoming
 more and more popular in Lundwood.  If
 we had done a survey from early years 
 canals and railways would be more in  
 use than cars eventhough cars have    
 been invented since the 19 hundreds.  
 Canals and railways were used to      
 transport heavy materials for         
 industry.  Cars mean that people can  
 travel far easier and at their own    
 convenience.
