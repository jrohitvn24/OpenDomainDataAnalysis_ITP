		<content>      These{Nurseries}were once the    
 walled garden and conservatory of     
{Halsway Manor.}Under glass Mr. and    
 Mrs. Bushen grow their numerous plants
 from {seed,cuttings and bulbs.}The    
 busiest time of the year is between   
 March and June when when the{bedding  
{plants}are produced and the{Christmas 
{pot plants}are started.               
{      Saturday}is{Taunton Market}     
 day.The plants for sale are prepared  
 on Friday and put into trays ready for
 loading into a van. During the winter 
 this takes place early on Saturdays so
 that the plants are not chilled.      
 Plants are also taken to many local   
 flower shows.                         
      To help outside an Izexy, a      
 mini-tractor is used. It has a plough,
 also lawn mower, crumbler and         
 rotavator attachments and operates    
 2-wheel and 4-wheel drive.            </content>
