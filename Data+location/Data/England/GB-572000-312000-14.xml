		<title>14RECREATION Pentney &amp; Narboro</title>
		<content>{Narborough}has four{football}teams, a 
{cricket}team and a trout fishery. The 
 football is played on Narborough's own
{field}which was purchased about 11 yrs
 ago. Recently further land was added  
 giving a total area of 8 acres and    
 will hopefully house the new community
 centre. The cricket team plays in     
 beautiful parkland at Narborough Hall.
                                       
{Pentney's playing field}was recently  
 donated by a parishioner and is used  
 by the youngsters. There is plenty of 
 scope for{anglers}at the Bradmoor     
 lakes and along the River Nar.{Water  
 Ski-ing takes place at the gravel     
 pits. There is an{indoor bowls}centre 
 of national standard.                 
                                       
 Various groups organise community     
 activities in both villages for the   
 benefit of all.                       </content>
