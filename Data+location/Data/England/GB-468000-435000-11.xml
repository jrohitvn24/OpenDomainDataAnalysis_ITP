		<title>11The Bubwith Field Day.</title>
		<content> Every year Bubwith holds its{Field    
{Day.}There are always plenty of stalls
 and entertainments,such as a bran tub,
 throwing wet sponges at people in the 
 stocks, a bouncy castle and a Punch   
 and Judy show.{Bubwith County Primary 
{School}performs some country dancing  
 and mounted a craft display.Before the
 crowning of the new Gala Queen there  
 is always a parade through the        
 village. There are several different  
 floats, one each for the new          
 and old queens and their attendants,  
 one for the playgroup and another for 
 fancy dress. Leading the floats there 
 is always a band. People bring        
 sandwiches and cakes to sell for teas 
 in the marquee. Every year{Field Day  
 raises about Â£1500 to maintain the    
 field and its buildings, and is always
 a great success.
