		<content> The Smiths arms is a pub and it is    
 in Town Gate. It was built in the 17th
 century. Number 46 and 48 are weavers 
 cottages. They were made in 1727 by   
 John Turner. The market cross steps   
 were made in the 14th century but the 
 stand and the cross were made in the  
 18th century. The cross was made to   
 show people where the market was      
 held. They used to have the market at 
 the church but it was so rough the    
 bishop said they had to move by a week
 or the market  would be closed down so
 the market moved over to Highburton.  
 The Croft House was 200 years old in  
 1985.It was built as a barn and it    
 had an extension in 1975 when the     
 Varlow family took over. The house and
 grounds were improved a lot recently. 
 The community centre used to be our   
 school. In 1981 when the school was   
 100 years old a new school opened.    </content>
