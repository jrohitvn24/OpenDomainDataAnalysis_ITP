		<content>   The village of Broadway is very     
 picturesque and has an interesting and
 somewhat controversial history. The   
 name is derived from ancient times    
 when the village grew up on the broad 
 way into the Neroche forest. The      
 village is ribbon-like in its         
 development and the modern village    
 site is at a considerable distance    
 from the church. Some say that this is
 because the original village was      
 wiped out in the plague years, but    
 another explanation is that as the    
 timber in the Neroche forest was used 
 up and the forest boundaries          
 contracted so the houses were built   
 near the forest so as to be close to  
 the supply of wood. Whatever the real 
 reasons, the result is a delightful   
 village to live in.
