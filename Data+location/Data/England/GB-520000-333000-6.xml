		<content>   A group of us went to look at the   
 shops in Donington . Although         
 Donington only has a population of    
 about 2000 we found that there are 25 
 shops. Some sell groceries and other  
 general provisions but there are some 
 specialist shops such as one that     
 makes and sells lampshades.           
   The shops that had the most         
 customers while we were watching were 
 the Post office ,the Spar and the     
 Co.op, followed by the two newsagents.
