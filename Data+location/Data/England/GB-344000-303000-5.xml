 is to say most farms in the area have 
 livestock and grow crops of roots and

 producers have increased their while

 rearing, {beef}production or{ sheep.

 winter{beans}are grown.These are a    
 good source of protien for animals    
 feeding.It used to be unusual to      
 harvest these before October but these

 possible to conbine them in late      </content>
