		<content> ON  THURSDAY THE 26TH SEPTEMBER       
 DAWN AND SHARON WENT TO THE           
 STAPLETON ARMS PUB. WE ASKED MRS      
 BROWN SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PUB,SHE
 SAID  "THE PUB WAS FIRST A CIDER HOUSE
 AND A PIG FARM." THE PRESENT BUILDING 
 HAD BEEN STANDING FOR OVER 100 YEARS. 
 THEN WE ASKED WHY IT WAS CALLED THE   
 STAPLETON ARMS? MRS BROWN ANSWERED    
 THAT THE PUB HAD BEEN CALLED THE      
 STAPLETON ARMS BECAUSE IT HAD BELONGED
 TO THE STAPLETON FAMILY. THE PUB IS A 
 FREE HOUSE AND SO IT SELLS ABOUT 290  
 BARRELS OF BEER A YEAR. A BARREL HOLDS
 ABOUT 36 GALLONS OF BEER. THE PUB BEST
 SELLING DRINKS ARE WHISKY AND DRAUGHT 
 BEER. THERE IS KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN AN  
 INN ON THE SITE BEFORE THE PUBLIC     
 HOUSE. THE OWNERS HAVE 3 CHILDREN ALL 
 MARRIED.THE PUB PLAY DARTS AND POOL.
