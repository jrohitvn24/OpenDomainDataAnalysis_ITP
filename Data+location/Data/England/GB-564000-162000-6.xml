		<title>06GEOLOGY OF HARVEL</title>
		<content> Geology of Harvel is the typical chalk
 formation of the North Downs crest.   
 An overall north facing dip slope     
 rises from about 400 to over 600 feet.
 The heads of three main valleys cut   
 steeply into this, falling to about   
 250 feet , without rivers or springs  
 but subject to heavy and rapid        
 drain-off from fields above.  In the  
 south-east, Holly Hill rises to 643   
 feet and has a capping of pebble, sand
 and loam.   The main North Downs scarp
 runs south and east of Holly Hill,    
 dropping sharply about 300 feet on to 
 gentle Gault-clay slopes.  The scarp  
 continues into the Medway Gap broken  
 by the Crookhorn Combe which faces    
 north-east.  Valleys and scarps have  
 thin chalk soils or bare chalk, but   
 the higher crest and ridges have a    
 clay-with-flints subsoil.
