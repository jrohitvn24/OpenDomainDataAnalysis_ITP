		<content> Clive says Aldborough Fair takes place
 during the week including 21st.June   
 for four days.It takes two days to set
 up.It used to be a horse fair and     
 covered both parts of The Green but is
 smaller now.There are dodgems,waltzers
 swing-boats,rifle-range,darts,candy   
 floss and various slot machines. The  
 fair is run by Mr Grey,who has the    
 right to be on The Green since before 
 World War Two.During the war he always
 left one caravan there on 21st.June as
 his right to run a fair.
