		<content>  The school children, teachers and    
 several parents spent an illuminating 
 morning exploring this ancient Iron   
 Age Hill Fort. The area, recently     
 purchased by the National Trust, is   
 1,000 feet high and is approached by  
 climbing steps cut into the side of   
 the steep hill.Sheep grazing has been 
 introduced by its new owners to       
 emphasise the Hill Fort's original    
 shape.Having climbed to the top, the  
 children enjoyed seeing the           
 archeological remains and learning    
 about the history of the site.It is   
 rare to see stones used for the       
 banks.The sheep will certainly help   
 reveal the Fort more fully and the new
 steps will encourage more visitors.   
 After exploring we all had an         
 enjoyable picnic on one side of a     
 bank.
