		<title>09Fashion in Chobham</title>
		<content> In 1985 most of the{fashionable shops 
 have{pale colours}e.g pastel pink mint
 lilac and pastel yellow. Now girls    
 wear light trousers, pale baggy shirts
 and a thick belt which is worn        
 loosly.In the{sixties}people wore     
 flares and{bellbottoms.}Some people   
 say they have come back into          
 fashion.The print on some clothes is  
 splodges and flowers.                 
 Old people think fashionable things   
 are for kids. In our area there are   
 not any nice childrens clothes shops, 
 no adults shops either. In Chobham    
 there is not very many{punky people.  
{Hairstyles}have gone crazy these days.
 Styles like{skinhead and rat's tail   
 are worn. Punks{gel}their hair and    
 spray it various colours.Tattoo shops 
 are about in London.
