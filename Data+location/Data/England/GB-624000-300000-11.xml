		<title>11Upper Stoke Family Life</title>
		<content> In Upper Stoke we spoke to a mother,  
 married with 2 children under 4. She  
 had no wish to live in a town such as 
 Norwich.She likes living in this      
 community and would not wish to it    
 change.She shops in Poringland,and    
 does not feel isolated living here,and
 does not attend the local Parish. She 
 travels around by foot.She has no time
 for entertaiment.She said that there  
 are enough surgeries.Her 2 daughters  
 will attend local schools.She thinks  
 there are enough activities for her   
 children,but there should be more     
 sports available.The family did not   
 support any of they village teams.She 
 did not want to see the village change
 and believed that a Marina Centre to  
 be built in 1985 would be most        
 welcome,this would make the village   
 more developed.                       
                                       </content>
