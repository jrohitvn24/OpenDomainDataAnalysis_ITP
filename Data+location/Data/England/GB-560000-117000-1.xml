		<content> The area studied is completely        
 contained in the parish of Warbleton  
 close to the market town, Heathfield. 
 The Manor of Warbleton is mentioned in
 the first Domesday survey in the Rape 
 of Hastings. The village of Rushlake  
 Green, about 2 miles from Warbleton   
 village is now the active heart of the
 area, being the meeting point of five 
 minor roads. Here houses cluster      
 around the triangular green           
 interspersed with two shops a public  
 house, a parish room and the Dunn     
 village hall. Until recently there was
 also a garage. A post office is part  
 of one of the village stores, which   
 also runs a delivery van, a vital     
 service to some isolated homes. The   
 Norman church of St Mary's with its   
 square stone tower lies up on the hill
 at Warbleton now a hamlet as are      
 Turners Green and Chapmans Town.      </content>
