		<title>10MECHANICAL MUSIC MUSEUM</title>
		<content> Mechanical music has been around      
 since 2 A.D. This museum was opened   
 in 1971. It grew out of the owner's   
 hobby. There are 64 instruments, from 
 a 200 year old musical snuffbox to    
 the "Trumpeter"- a Belgian fairground 
 organ built in 1919. An automatic     
 jazz band, used mainly in cafes was   
 built in America in 1920. The first   
 instrument in the collection was a    
 polyphon, which plays metal discs with
 holes in to give the various notes.   
 There were three pianolas which play  
 from rolls of perforated paper. One of
 them had an automatic piano player.   
 This had fingers which played when the
 operator worked foot pedals. We saw   
 various music boxes in which the notes
 come from drums with teeth in them.   
 One of them could play 8 tunes. The   
 museum is very popular. It had 58000  
 visitors last year.                   </content>
