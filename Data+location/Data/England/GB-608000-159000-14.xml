		<title>14Bus services Dargate/Blean</title>
		<content> Service 637/8 passes through Dargate  
 /NW corner/.  There are 5 buses per   
 day Whitstable to Faversham and 6 per 
 day in the opposite direction, Mondays
 to Saturdays. No Sunday buses. The    
 service is shared by East Kent Road   
 Car Co. and Donsway Coaches, a private
 company.  The most regular users are  
 school children in term time when it  
 is sometimes standing room only.  From
 time to time we hear rumours that the 
 service is to be cut further.         
 Homey Hill /NE corner/ is much better 
 served as it is on the A290 between   
 Whitstable and Canterbury.  Red       
 double-decker buses travel in each    
 direction at 20 minute intervals      
 during the week and every hour on     
 Sundays.  The service is very popular 
 and well used with extra buses being  
 put on at rush hours.
