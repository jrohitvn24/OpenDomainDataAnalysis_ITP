		<content>It offers a wide variety of different  
sports, at present numbering 25. The 2 
most popular are squash and badminton. 
The Centre is open 7 days a week and is
used by over 100,000 people each year. 
The age range of people who use it is  
from 2 to over 70.  The weather affects
the number of people who use the       
Leisure Centre as it limits the use of 
the outside facilities such as tennis  
courts.  The busiest time at the Centre
is from 6.00pm to 10.00pm each evening.
It is also very busy in the school     
holidays when special activities are   
organised for the children.  The Centre
has a bar and cafeteria.  Annual       
membership costs 7.00 for an adult and 
3.00 for a child if they live in       
Watford.  Users mainly live within a 12
mile radius.
