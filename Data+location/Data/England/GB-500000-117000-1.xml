		<content> The overall impression of the area is 
 of natural beauty, of woodland and    
 river, of quiet rural serenity. Trees 
 are by far the most dominating factor.
 Within a designated green belt area,  
 modern building is almost             
 non-existant. The boundaries of the   
 hamlets and villages within the area  
 are well-defined with no ribbon       
 development along the inter-connecting
 roads. Lack of a regular public       
 transport system emphasises the       
 isolation, particularly for the older 
 members of the community. Attempts    
 have been made to overcome this,      
 through the provision of a Community  
 Mini-bus. The population of the       
 villages tend to be over-weighted with
 retired people, hardly surprising when
 there is so little work available in  
 the area. Some of the available       
 property is used as a weekend retreat,</content>
