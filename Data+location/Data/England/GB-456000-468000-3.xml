		<content> There is one bus service in the       
 village which runs between Brandsby   
 and York via Crayke and Easingwold. It
 makes three trips. one early morning, 
 dinner time and evening. Most people  
 in Crayke need a car to get to work   
 and to the shops. A very small        
 proportion use motor bikes, pedal     
 cycle or walk                         
                                       
 The roads are very narrow and twisted 
 and Crayke is on a main route to      
 Malton and Helmsley which is on the   
 way to the east coast.                
                                       
 It isn't difficult to walk to the     
 nearest town of Easingwolds which is  
 two miles away as it is downhill, but 
 coming back the walk is difficult as  
 the hill is steep                     
                                       
                                       </content>
