		<title>19TEACHERS INDUSTRIAL DISPUTE</title>
		<content> In 1985,a prolonged dispute between   
 teachers,management and the government
 took place.This was basically about   
 erosion in salaries since the Houghton
 and Clegg awards of the 1970's and    
 about the governments intention to try
 to link any pay award to a much       
 greater restriction(or control) of    
 teacher and education.                
 It would be interesting to try to     
 predict the future of teaching but I  
 foresee a growth in the importance of 
 personal and social development with  
 children in schools,and a lessening of
 the more traditional values of schools
 such as memorising facts etc..        
 The dispute currently operating,has   
 curtailed many school activities and  
 led to parents receiving no reports   
 and having no opportunity to consult  
 their child's teacher.A meeting today 
 (11:7:85) is due to make a new offer. </content>
