		<content> In the Calcot area increasing numbers 
 of women are going out to work,either 
 full time or part time.This has       
 caused problems with some families.   
 Divorces and separations have         
 increased in recent years.However,with
 other families two incomes have led   
 to increased freedoms and activities  
 which have cemented relationships.    
 Homes now contain many appliances     
 which make work easier-cookers,washing
 -machines,refrigeraters,and deep      
 freezers.Men are taking an increasing 
 role in household duties.To own a car 
 is now commonplace.Families enjoy     
 greater mobility,not only for         
 visiting,but also for eating out at   
 restaurants,and for entertainment.Most
 people now have a holiday away from   
 their home,with larger numbers going  
 abroad on 'package holidays'.
