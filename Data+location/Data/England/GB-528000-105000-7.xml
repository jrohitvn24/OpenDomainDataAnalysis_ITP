		<title>07Brighton Bombing</title>
		<content> On October 12th 1983 there was an     
 annual Conervative party Conference   
 held in Brighton. There was no secrets
 held from the public. The large       
 majority of the M.P.s concerned stayed
 at 'The Grand' hotel which was        
 situated along the sea_front.         
 The bomb was wrapped in cellophane so 
 the dogs would not have been able to  
 'sniff' it out, it was also           
 strategically placed to cause the     
 maximum damage possible. The bomb went
 off at 2 am in the morning and many of
 the MPs were sleping. The damage was  
 intense and 'The Grand'was scarred    
 with a big hole in the front of the   
 building.                             
 The IRA claimed responsibility for    
 this act which killed several people.
