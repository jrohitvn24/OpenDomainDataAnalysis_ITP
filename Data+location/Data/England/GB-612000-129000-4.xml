		<title>04THE DYMCHURCH SEA WALL</title>
		<content> The sea wall has been essential to    
 Romney Marsh local history for        
 hundreds of years. The Southern Water 
 Authority is in charge of its         
 maintenance. The present construction 
 is stone and brick. The sea wall is   
 under continuous repair. Workmen test 
 for weakness by drilling into the     
 wall, they then pour in concrete. In  
 June 1985, six men were replacing some
 of the large stone cubes near the base
 of the wall on the seaward side. The  
 sea wall near Beach Estate is sixty   
 metres thick at the base, and narrows 
 to about three metres at the top. It  
 slopes gently up from the sea and     
 drops away sharply to the road at the 
 other side. This design slows down the
 sea and a seaward curve turns the     
 waves back on themselves to take the  
 strength from the incoming tide.
