 space at the top of Hall's Hill is    
 locally known as the Hills and        
 Hollows, so called after stone had    
 been extracted for roads earlier this

 walking and also for scrambling on low
 powered motor bikes.Harrowby Hall is a
 17th or 18th century farm house which 
 is now a private dwelling house. The  
 local people claim that the Hall is
