		<content> 1t. Bartholomews church stands at the 
top of Church Hill.  The first church  
was built around 1200, although        
services were held on the present site 
at the time of the first Domesday      
Survey.                                
The church has a tower 80 feet high    
which houses a clock installed in 1887.
The church bells are still in use and  
ca be heard regularly during the week. 
The most valuable thing in the church  
is the chalice.  Last year some of the 
stonework had to be replaced because it
was crumbling.  Most of the church is  
made from sandstone.                   
Our vicar is Mr. Frost.  This morning  
he came to talk to the fourth year.    
Every year school leavers receive a    
bible adn prayer book.  In 1669 Charles
Winn, vicar of Penn, left some money   
for this.  The Charles Winn foundation 
is still remembered today.             </content>
