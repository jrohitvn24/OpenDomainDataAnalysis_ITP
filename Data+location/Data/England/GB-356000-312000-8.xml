		<title>08THE PUB AT RODINGTON</title>
		<content> A LANDLORD HAS A VERY DEMANDING JOB.  
 THE PUB IS OPEN FROM 12 NOON TILL     
 2 P.M. AND FROM 7 TILL 10.30 P.M.ON   
 SUNDAYS. FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK THE 
 PUB OPENS FROM 12 NOON TILL 2.30 P.M. 
 AND FROM 7 TILL 11 P.M.  ON BANK      
 HOLIDAYS THERE IS AN AUTOMATIC        
 EXTENSION TILL 11.30 P.M.  AT         
 WEEK-ENDS THERE ARE ABOUT 100 PEOPLE  
 IN THE BAR WHICH IS FAIRLY CROWDED.   
 THE BUSIEST NIGHT OF THE WEEK IN THE  
 LOUNGE IS THURSDAYS. THE LANDLORD     
 THINKS THIS IS BECAUSE THURSDAY IS PAY
 DAY. THE QUIETEST NIGHTS ARE MONDAYS  
 (WHEN THE LANDLORD HAS HIS DAY OFF)   
 AND WEDNESDAYS.                       
 THEY SERVE MEALS EVERY DAY, BOTH AT   
 LUNCH TIME AND IN THE EVENING. THIS   
 INCREASES BUSINESS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE 
 PREPARED TO TRAVEL REASONABLE         
 DISTANCES WHICH THEY WOULD NOT FOR    
 JUST A DRINK.                         </content>
