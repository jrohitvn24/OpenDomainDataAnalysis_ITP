		<title>06    WOODMANSEY LIFE</title>
		<content>     As Woodmansey only has a shop and 
 a post office,  most people do their  
 main shopping in nearby{Beverley}.    
 Larger items,  such as furniture,  are
 often obtained in {Hull}.             
     The village has a busy social     
 life with bingo,  Red Cross and mother
 and toddler groups held at the        
 community centre;  other groups meet  
 at the church.   Regular outings are  
 organised for the older folk.         
     The mobile library visits the     
 village once a fortnight,  this being 
 a welcome and well-used service.      
     Of all the people interviewed     
 everyone agreed that they enjoyed     
 living in Woodmansey.
