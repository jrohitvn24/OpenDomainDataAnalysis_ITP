		<title>12THE M25 MOTORWAY.</title>
		<content> The motorway was finally completed and
opened in January 1985.                
FOR:The majority of the people who we  
questioned agreed with the M25 as they 
thought it took the traffic away from  
the area and that it was easier to get 
around London.                         
AGAINST:The Lea Valley M25 Alliance is 
the committee against the M25.Many     
houses have been affected by the       
motorway from Waltham Cross to Bell    
Common,and they have been offered      
double glazing.There were many         
complaints about the M25,and so people 
were promised that trees would be      
planted when the motorway was built,but
up to now there have been none.One     
girl's home is 108 metres from the     
motorway.There are earth mounds still  
dumped around her house.People with    
problems like this are demanding a rate
reduction.                             </content>
