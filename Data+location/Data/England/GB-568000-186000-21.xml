<title>21Basildon Town Centre 2011</title>
<content>A lot has changed in Basildon Town Centre since the original Domesday article was written; many of the shops named have disappeared, either through closure or relocation. Dixons, Alders, C&amp;A, Army &amp; Navy all closed down; Sainsbury's relocated to an out-of-town store and, in it's place came Asda. Back when the original article was written, there were high hopes for a roof for the Town Centre - this didn't happen, and instead there have been a number of new retail blocks added on the edges of the Town Square, including the Westgate.&lt;br />&lt;br />As in many other shopping centres and high streets, where once there were branches of Woolworths, Co-Op and C&amp;A, there are now branches of Poundland, 99p or Less and Primark.&lt;br />&lt;br />The town centre's cinema closed down, and has not been replaced.  The market is still going, though some of the original stalls have been replaced with timber cabins.&lt;br />&lt;br />The shopping area still seems busy, though it has been hit in recent years by such Out-of-town developments as Pipps Hill, Lakeside, and Bluewater.
