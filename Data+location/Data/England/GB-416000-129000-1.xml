 City of Salisbury. It is made up      
 almost entirely of farmland and       
 downland. 91% of the area is privately
 owned by the{Clarendon Estate,}which  
 has 3 tenanted farms on this block. As
 well the Estate has{the ruined remains
{of the Royal Palace of Clarendon,}the 
 favourite hunting, leisure residence  
 of a number of English monachs from   
 the 12c.to the end of the 16c. Only a 
 small part of the village of          
 Laverstock lies within the area - less
 than 5%. A further 2% is available for
 industry serving Salisbury city and

 comprises of modern individual homes  
 with plenty of land per plot which are
 typical of the successful buisness man
