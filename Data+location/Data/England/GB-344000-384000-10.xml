		<title>10A Typical day in Halewood.</title>
		<content>    My name is Lindsey. I am ten years 
 old. I get up at eight o'clock, get   
 washed and dressed and go downstairs  
 to get my breakfast. I then clean my  
 teeth, rush downstairs and run to     
 school.                               
    After the register we all go into  
 assembly where one of the teachers    
 tells us a story. We also have a hymn 
 and a prayer.                         
    We do lots of different lessons    
 each day. We do a lot of maths and    
 English. Our other lessons are        
 history, geography, science, art, P.E.
 games, music and scripture. On Fridays
 I stay behind to do gymnastics.       
    When I get home I call for my      
 friend Caroline. We play in my bedroom
 or we go outside. After my dogs have  
 had their tea Caroline and I take them
 for a walk. I go in at about half past
 eight and I go to bed at ten o'clock. </content>
