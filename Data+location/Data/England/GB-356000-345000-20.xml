		<content>{   Eleven children, the entire school 
{roll, aged from five to eleven}were   
 responsible for making this study.They
 have observed at first hand about 90% 
 of the land cover, the remaining      
 portions being beyond physical access,
 and therefore calculated from maps and
 from third parties.                   
    We are grateful to the people who  
 gave us time to demonstrate their     
 skills.Assistance from the many people
 both known and unknown to us who have 
 completed our questionnaires.Those who
 offered refreshment on our travels,   
 gave us parking space and the whole   
 community who encouraged us in our    
 study.
