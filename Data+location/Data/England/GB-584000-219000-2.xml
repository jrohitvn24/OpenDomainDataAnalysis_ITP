		<title>02WILDLIFE IN THE AREA</title>
		<content>      There is a large area of open    
 countryside in the area between       
 Feering and Coggeshall Hamlet. Much of
 this is farmland, but there is        
 wildlife supported by the hedgerows,  
 the roadside verges and the Blackwater
 Valley.                               
      There are many species of plants,
 including many wild grasses and wild  
 flowers; such as vetches, ox-eye      
 daisies, poppies and campion.         
      Many of the more common bird     
 species can be found here too,        
 including skylarks, wood pigeon and,  
 in the summer, house martins and      
 cuckoos. Occasionally a kestrel may be
 seen hovering over a roadside verge in
 search of food. The farmland itself is
 kept clear of these things by         
 spraying,for insects and weeds, and   
 the use of scarecrows and kites to    
 keep birds away from crops.           </content>
