		<content> The Survey Block consists mainly of   
 gently undulating farmland with the   
 village of{NORTON IN HALES}being the  
 only populated area of any            
 significance.                         
                                       
 Most farming is Dairying,but some     
 field boundaries have been removed to 
 ease the managment of cereal crops.   
                                       
 In the south east corner of the block 
 are several plantations of mixed      
 woodland.                             
                                       
 There are several large halls in the  
 area where estate owners used to live.
 Lots of farms show up on the          
 landscape.                            
                                       
 The church tower and several large    
 Scots Pine trees dominate the village 
 skyline.                              </content>
