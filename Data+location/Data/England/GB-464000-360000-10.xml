		<title>10HOME LIFE IN EAKRING (cont)</title>
		<content> Video recorders record any programme  
 you wish or you can hire a new film on
 video tape and watch it in the comfort
 of your home. More people are getting 
 Computers and you can buy quite a     
 selection of programmes, ranging from 
 Games to Educational. Home Life in    
 Eakring for women centres around their
 homes as there are limited            
 opportunities for women to work after 
 having children and while they are    
 still at school because very few jobs 
 cater for women with children. Some   
 women go to various schools for       
 classes with a wide range of subjects 
 available. Sports facilities for all  
 the family are quite near, Squash     
 Courts and a Sauna at Bilsthorpe.     
 Badminton, swimming and other indoor  
 sports are available at Ollerton,     
 Southwell and Rainworth Sports        
 Centres.                              </content>
