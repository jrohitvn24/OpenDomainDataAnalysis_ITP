		<title>01Introduction to Park Cross.</title>
		<content> The area is mostly{farmland}and it    
 lies between the villages of          
 Carisbrooke and Calbourne.To the South
 there are the Downs which are formed  
 of chalk. Part of Parkhurst Forest is 
 to be found to the North-East of the  
 area.There is more woodland to the    
 West.Most of the land in the centre of
 the area is fields. Except for a small
 residential area to the East there are
 very few houses at all.Through the    
 middle of our area there are the      
 remains of an old railway. Most of the
 farms are livestock, but there is     
 one large arable farm. Several of the 
 farmhouses are at least two hundred   
 years old, but the oldest and most    
 interesting building is Swainston     
 Manor. The only{industry}is a printing
 and card manufacturing works. Two main
 roads to the West Wight cross the     
 area.                                 </content>
