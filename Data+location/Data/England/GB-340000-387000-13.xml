		<title>13SWEET SURVEY IN BELLE VALE</title>
		<content>  In our sweet survey there were{thirty
{six}different varieties of sweets     
 chosen.{Crisps}got the highest vote.  
 These are potatoes sliced very thinly,
 cooked and then coated with many      
 different flavours. Next came{Mars    
{bars.}These are milk chocolate bars   
 with caramel and a sort of soft fluffy
 fudge in the middle. They have been   
 popular for years. The next highest   
 vote was for{milk chocolate}on its own
 as plain chocolate I think is a bit   
 sickly.{Toffee}came next. This sticks 
 to your teeth. I like it hard but most
 prefer it soft so that it doesn't     
 break your teeth.{Twix}came next. It  
 is my favourite sweet and is a biscuit
 covered with toffee and chocolate.    
{Minstrels}and{Jelly Babies}both got   
 high votes. Minstrels are chocolate   
 beans with different centres and Jelly
 Babies are in the shape of little men.</content>
