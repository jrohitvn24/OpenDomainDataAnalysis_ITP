		<content>    One of the biggest hotels in       
 Torquay is The Imperial which was     
 opened in 1863 marking a great change 
 in tourist accommodation.It was the   
 first large hotel and the first to be 
 built on the edge of a cliff.It is now
 a five star hotel.Another famous hotel
 is The Palace.It is called The Palace 
 because it was The Bishop of Exeter's 
 own home.In 1942 it was used as a     
 hospital for wounded R.A.F            
 Officers.People say there were many   
 casualties from bombing but no details
 were ever given.The Palace is a four  
 star hotel with many sporting         
 activities for tourist and businessmen
 It is used for conferences and trade  
 fairs.Many of the big houses in the   
 area have been turned into boarding   
 houses or hotels offering bead and    
 breakfast and an optional evening     
 meal.                                 </content>
