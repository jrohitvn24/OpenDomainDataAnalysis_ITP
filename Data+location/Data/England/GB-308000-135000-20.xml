		<content>   Although the co-ordination for this 
 Block was done at{Danesfield School  }
 and the School contact there provided 
 a lot of the information much of the  
 field work was done by the pupils of  
{Stogumber First School.   }           
   This tiny Village School with not   
 many more than 20 pupils,a full time  
 headmistress and a partime teacher

 for many years though this does now   
 seem to have  receded.

 the Project.
