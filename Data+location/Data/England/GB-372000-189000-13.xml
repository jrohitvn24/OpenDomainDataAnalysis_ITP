		<title>13KINGSWOOD: CHILDREN'S VIEW</title>
		<content>  I like Kingswood because: it isn't   
 noisy at night, it has very nice big  
 houses with big drives, you can go for
 long walks, it has a playing field    
 with swings, it has pretty gardens, it
 has a stream where I catch fish, it   
 has lots of farms and places to walk  
 and play, it has a sweet shop, it is a
 peaceful village, it has got a good   
 scrambling course in a field, it has a
 stream with ducks. There is not much  
 traffic and nor much vandalism. I like
 the space round our village hall where
 we can ride our bikes. We like special
 occasions in Kingswood like jumble    
 sales, discos or races. I like the    
 school best. I don't like liter or dog
 dirt on the pavement. I wish Kingswood
 had more shops, especially a toy shop 
 and an ice cream shop. I wish we had a
 swimming pool, a library, a cave or a 
 great big ruin of a castle.           </content>
