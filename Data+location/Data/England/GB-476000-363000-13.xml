 Sutton Church's tower has a Norman    
 base which may be sited on an old     
 Anglo Saxon Church.                   
      The Meering Chapel, probably     
 1525,is a fine example of             
 Perpendicular work. The screen is very
 beautiful. The font cover is Jacobean.
      The present incumbent is Canon   
 Hatter. He is responsible for 4       
 churches, and conducts services in    
 each of them.                         
      30 to 40 people attend church    
 each Sunday and 20 children attend    
 Sunday School.                        
      The church holds many social     
 functions,eg. May Day Festival,All    
 Saints Supper(Harvest Festival)and    
 Christmas celebrations.               
                       Occasionally    
 cultural events take place eg. Music  
 Concerts,Flower Festivals and Drama.  </content>
