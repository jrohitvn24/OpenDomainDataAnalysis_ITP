		<content>  The  village  has  a  church, a  post
 office, a  pub and a  public telephone
 (many houses have their own phone).   
  There is  no longer a village shop or
 school. When the latter closed it  was
 taken over by the Parish  Council as a
 village hall.                         
  Each week a fishmonger, a grocer  and
 a greengrocer visit the village.      
  Milk,   newspapers   and   mail   are
 delivered  daily  and  a  library  van
 visits every fortnight.               
  A Keep Fit class  and  an  Upholstery
 class  are  held  each   week  in  the
 village  hall  as  are  monthly  Whist
 Drives and W.I. meetings.             
  There is an annual Harvest Supper and
 an annual Village Quiz.               
  Two  ladies  darts  teams, two  gents
 darts teams, a  skittles  team  and  a
 pool team are based at the Willow Tree
 public house in the village.          </content>
