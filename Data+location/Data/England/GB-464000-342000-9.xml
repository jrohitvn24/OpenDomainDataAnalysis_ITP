		<content>  Mrs.Marson,retired infant teacher was
 born and has lived all her life in the
 village.She began teaching in the     
 village hall in 1955.She had 97 pupils
 and another teacher to help.She had   
 little equipment and sometimes the    
 pupils had to leave so that other     
 groups could use the hall.            
  She remembers the village by-pass    
 being built in the 1930's and         
 travelling to Nottingham by train for 
 4d and bus for 10d return.There were  
 no houses at all up to and past the   
 new school,where there used to be an  
 orchard.                              
  Mrs.Marson taught a mother and a     
 father of two children in Mrs.Kirby's 
 class and now her granddaughter is in 
 our infant department.She worked for  
 five head teachers during her 24 years
 at Burton Joyce school.
