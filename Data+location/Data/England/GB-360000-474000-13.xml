		<content>{BRONTE COTTAGES}in Cowan Bridge was   
 once the Clergy Daughters School      
 founded in 1820 by the Vicar of       
 Tunstall the Rev.W.C.Wilson. In 1824  
 Charlotte Bronte and her sisters      
 became pupils. Her life there was     
 reflected in the famous book "Jane    
 Eyre". Next to Bronte Cottages was a  
 Bobbin Mill.                          
{HALLS}Whoop Hall was once called Upp  
 Hall. It is called Upp because it is  
 Upper to Burrow Hall.The first time it
 appears as Whoop Hall was in 1794 in  
 Tunstall Church register. The reason  
 for it being called Whoop Hall was    
 that Mr.Christopher Picard kept a pack
 of hounds at his house in Cowan Bridge
 and the publican of that date thought 
 that he would attract more custom by  
 changing its name.Cowan Bridge has had
 different names, Collon Bridge,Collyn 
 Bridge and finally Cowan Bridge.      </content>
