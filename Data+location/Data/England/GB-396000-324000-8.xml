		<title>08  INGESTRE HALL TODAY</title>
		<content>  In 1961, the 21st Earl of Shrewsbury 
sold Ingestre Hall to the West         
Bromwich Council. It is now a          
Residential Arts Centre offering       
courses in Art, drama and music.   At  
present, the hall maintains 27 acres   
of land, some of which are             
"capability Brown" design. There are   
Landscape gardens on display with      
lawns flowerbeds, and Albino and       
Indian  Peacocks can be seen in the    
grounds.  Other facilities include     
play areas, a  miniture golf course    
and an outdoor swimming pool.    Close 
to the Hall there is a  beautiful      
Chapel, erected in 1676 by Sir Walter  
Chetwynd, grandson of the man who      
built the present hall. It is  elegant 
and classical and beleived to be   a   
Wren design. The Chapel is still used  
for services today.
