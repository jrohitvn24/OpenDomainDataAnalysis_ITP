		<title>08The Village of Lanjeth</title>
		<content> Lanjeth is a small village on the main
 road between St. Austell and Newquay. 
 It is surrounded by the two main China
 Clay works in the area namely the ones
 at Blackpool and Burngullow. There    
 used to be a large pit at Blackpool   
 but now this has closed down. The area
 around Burngullow contains the most up
 to date equipment used for drying     
 clay. This decline in the local       
 industry has had its effects upon the 
 village. The Post Office has recently 
 closed down and the Primary School has
 been turned into a private house.     
 The village still has its own         
 Methodist Church (1867) and a very    
 popular village hall completed in     
 March 1983. There is a wide variety   
 of houses in the village and there are
 four large farms in the surrounding   
 area. The Lanjeth Riding School is    
 also popular locally.     (Mike Yates)</content>
