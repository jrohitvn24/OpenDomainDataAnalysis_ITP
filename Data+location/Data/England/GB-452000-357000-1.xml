 The area to the south of Mansfied     
 contains arable and mixed farmland ,  
 coniferous woodland and, in the       
 north, built up areas. The residential
 area tends to be in the north-east,   
 consisting mainly of private detached 
 and semi-detached housing. The        
 industry is mainly in the north-west, 
 on a recently built industrial estate.
           There is a College of       
 Further Education,two middle and one  
 first schools (the latter with a      
 nursery unit attached.) Harlow Wood   
 Hospital is in an area of woodland    
 owned by the Forestry Commission.     
 There is also a rehabilitation        
 centre,two parks with facilities for  
 football, rugby and athletics. There  
 are also two quarries, two churches   
 and a crematorium.                    </content>
