		<title>12Shropshire Union Canal</title>
		<content>  The Shropshire Union Canal was built 
by Thomas Telford. It joins the        
Manchester Ship Canal at Ellesmere Port
and goes to the heart of the West      
Midlands. There are 46 locks on the    
main canal. The canal was opened in    
1836.                                  
  We went to the Boat Inn by the canal.
There were lots of boats. We went under
number 35 bridge. Perhaps the bridge   
numbers help the people on the barges  
to navigate. We found out that barges  
went the opposite way to the cars on   
the road. The names of some of the     
barges we saw were Salten Fjord,       
Christina, Desert Express and Rite of  
Spring. I do think these are strange   
names. As we came near to the second   
bridge the canal seemed to get         
narrower. Before the bridge it is wide 
enough for 3 barges but under the      
bridge it is only wide enough for one  </content>
