		<content>   The main street with it's 17th and  
 18th century buildings is a           
 conservation area but during the last 
 seventeen years two new small estates 
 have been built.It is unlikely that   
 further developments will be allowed. 
   80% of the dwellings are owner      
 occupied,15% are owned by scarborough 
 Council and 5% are rented from private
 landlords.Several properties are for  
 holiday letting and there is a small  
 caravan site in the village.          
   Most people work in the Scarborough 
 area,Gristhorpe coming a close second 
 with a large percentage being involved
 in agriculture.A high proportion of   
 newcomers to the village are retired. 
   There is a fairly even balance of   
 local families and newcomers.Several  
 local families have lived in the      
 Gristhorpe area for generations.
