		<content>  Oil: The development of the Humbly   
 Grove oilfield in the block caused    
 much local concern about the possible 
 spoilation of the natural environment.
 A local pressure group HOPE (Hampshire
 Oil -Protection of Environment) was   
 formed and its activities prompted the
 Hampshire County Council to order     
 stringent conditions for protection of
 the environment when they approved the
 proposals for development of the      
 oilfield. Consequently one wellsite   
 was moved about 200 metres to a       
 location which provided better        
 screening and another moved the same  
 distance to protect the habitat of    
 a relatively rare butterfly, the Duke 
 of Burgundy Fritillary. High earth    
 mounds have been built up around the  
 wellsites with grass and trees to hide
 pumping equipment in the landscape .
