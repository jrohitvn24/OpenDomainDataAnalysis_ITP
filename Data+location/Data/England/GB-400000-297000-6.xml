		<content> The two hospitals in Walsall are{The  
{General}and{The Manor.}About 52 people
 are admitted to hospital daily. Each  
 week 120 people are treated for       
 accidents involving cars. 6% of the   
 weekly intake are the elderly, the    
 majority having suffered strokes.{The 
{Manor}has 29 wards, 4 of which are for
 the elderly. On average,{55 babies}are
 born each week.                       
{Walsall Health Authority}employs{4200 
 people. It costs{Â£17,000,000}a year to
 run one hospital. An extension is     
 being built onto{The Manor}which      
 should be completed by 1988.          
 A statue of{Sister Dora,}the first    
 nurse in charge of{The General}can be 
 seen in the{town centre.              
 Statistics for 1983 show Walsall to be
 one of the unhealthiest places to live
 in the West Midlands.
