		<content>      Mr. I. Clough has two bulls and  
 50 Pedigree Lincoln Red breeding cows,
 ages varying up to 12 years, after    
 which they go to the slaughter house  
 at Boston.  Calves are born in        
 November/December and are turned out  
 to grass with their mothers during    
 April.  In October they are taken from
 their mothers and fattened in the crew
 sheds.  They are each fed daily on    
 good hay and about 4 kg. of balanced  
 food consisting of rolled oats and    
 barley, and a mixture of protein      
 concentrates.                         
      At about 15 months old, when the 
 calves weigh approximately 450 - 500  
 kg. live weight, most calves are sent 
 to Skegness Meat Traders, while the   
 best female calves are added to the   
 breeding stock, and sometimes two bull
 calves are sold to other farmers for  
 breeding.                             </content>
