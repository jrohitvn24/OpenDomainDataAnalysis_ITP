		<title>10TENANTED LAND IN CLANFIELD</title>
		<content> All five farm houses in the area,have 
 in recent times been sold privately,  
 together with small plots of adjoining
 land.This was done by the owner of    
 South Leigh Estates, Sir Lynton White,
 to reduce the death duties.The land   
 areas still owned by Southleigh       
 Estates, (based at Havant)are rented  
 by the farmers who reside in adjacent 
 areas.There are three main types of   
 agriculture practiced here:arable     
 (cereal and root crops),dairy (though 
 much reduced by E.E.C.restrictions)   
 and on the high downland,sheep.The    
 lynchet banks showing the ancient     
 field system are still visible. South 
 Leigh Estates are directly responsible
 for maintaining the woodland _ a      
 mixture of deciduous and conifer trees
 grown on a commercial basis.
