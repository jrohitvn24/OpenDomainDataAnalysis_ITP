		<title>09TWO EVENTS IN SOUTH REIGATE</title>
		<content>       Two annual events occur in the  
 east of the area.An annual fete is    
 held in the Priory Park each summer   
 preceded by a procession of some twen-
 ty floats.In the park are stalls from 
 Benson's,the local funfair, or spons- 
 ored by various commercial interests. 
 Competitons are held such as the one  
 in which a girl from St.Luke's Middle 
 School won a prize for riding on a    
 bull.Among the floats is one entered  
 by the Sovereign Youth Club.          
       An annual Donkey Derby is held  
 in August on the South Park Football  
 Ground.Spectators are able to become  
 "jockeys" for a day or merely to have 
 a "flutter" on the results of races.  
 Stalls and side-shows are also to be  
 seen.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
