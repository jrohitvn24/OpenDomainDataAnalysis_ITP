		<title>12 NOTCUTTS NURSERY WOODBRIDGE</title>
		<content> Notcutts is a horticultural centre.   
The main branch is based in Woodbridge.
There are 8 other branches in England: 
at Ardleigh, St Albans, Birmingham,    
Norwich, Peterborough, Maidstone,      
Bagshot and Oxford.                    
 Notcutts sell their plants, shrubs    
etc. throughout the United  Kingdom    
and overseas. Notcutts in  Woodbridge  
own 540 acres of land. The Woodbridge  
branch has been open since 1749 and    
was first known as{ Woods} but became  
known as {Notcutts} in 1897.           
 Roughly 500 people are employed at    
the moment. Of these 320 are men and   
180 are women. The jobs include part-  
time and Saturday work of various      
degrees of skill. Employees work 37-40 
hours in a full time job.              
 It is possible that in the near       
future mechanisation   may replace     
some of the   manual jobs.             </content>
