		<title>05A School Day</title>
		<content> At 7.00am on a school day my alarm    
 wakes me up, and I get dressed and    
 washed, and I put the stair_gate up   
 for Michael. Then at about 7.10am to  
 7.15am, I lay the breakfast for       
 7.30am. At about 7.40am we have       
 breakfast, I have muesli with milk,and
 tea and toast to follow. At about     
 8.30am I go to school. When I arrive I
 set up the projector, if I have any   
 spare time after that I go out on the 
 playground.Then it is assembly and the
 various lessons of the day follow. At 
 3.30pm I go home and do my homework,  
 after that I ask my mum if she wants  
 me to help. If she does I help her if 
 not I play with my brothers. Then at  
 5.45pm to 6.30pm we have dinner, and  
 after that I peel tomorrows spuds,then
 I make my packed lunches. Sometimes I 
 help in the garden or read and play my
 game until bedtime.                   </content>
