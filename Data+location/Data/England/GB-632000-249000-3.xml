Although only the very edge of an      
establishment to do with the Armed     
Forces is in this area, the effect of  
the nearby American Air Force Bases of 
Woodbridge and Bentwaters are felt in  
many aspects of life.                  
                                       
The volume of traffic using the roads  
through the area is greatly increased  
by service personnel travelling by car,
lorry and van between the bases.       
                                       
Servicemen also like to live off base; 
three houses in this area are occupied 
by Americans.  During "alerts" local   
residents are often aware of the extra 
activity, either by increased aircraft 
noise or traffic travelling through at 
unusual times.                         
                                       
                                       </content>
