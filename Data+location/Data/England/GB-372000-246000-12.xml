		<title>12CRADLEY HOME LIFE:GETTING UP</title>
		<content> I woke up from a bad dream.I did not  
 want to go back to sleep again so I   
 looked at the clock, it was only      
 7.30a.m. past seven but I got up      
 because I could not be bothered to    
 wait until 8.00a.m.I peered through   
 the door of my wardrobe,seeing what I 
 could wear.Ah,a nice pair of jeans and
 a dotty t-shirt!But then mum came in  
 and said "You're not wearing those    
 jeans!They are so dirty and as for    
 that T-shirt,it is too big for you!". 
 "I noticed that,"I said.  So instead,I
 picked out a warm woolly skirt and a  
 woolly jumper because it was cold     
 outside.I leaped down the stairs      
 risking my life!As I was eating my    
 "Harvest Crunch"I glanced at the clock
 it was already 8.00 a.m.              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
