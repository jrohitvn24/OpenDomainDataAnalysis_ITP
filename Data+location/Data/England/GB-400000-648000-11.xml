		<content> Most of the housing in the village was
 provided by local mine owners during  
 the early part of this century.       
     During the 1940s and 1950s the    
 local{Council}started to build houses 
 and included in this scheme were some 
 sheltered housing for old people and  
 bungalows for the{disabled.           
     The sheltered housing is called   
 Armstrong Court and there are 24 flats
 with a warden's flat.Most of the old  
 people live there and they have a     
 common room where they can all meet   
 together.                             
     Other houses in the village are   
 owned by the{Greenwich Hospital Estate
 and some are private houses.          
     The Youth Leader lives in the old 
 School House and a doctor lives in the
 Old Vicarage and Scremerston now comes
 under the vicar of Spittal.
