		<content> Ground use outside the villages is    
 almost all{arable farming}with a few  
 grass paddocks.Main crops are potatoes
 and sugar beet plus barley and wheat. 
 Some peas are grown for drying.In very
 recent years{oil seed rape}has become 
 common with its distinctive yellow    
 flowers and smell.Few,if any,carrots  
 or cabbages are grown.Government and{ 
{E.E.C.}controls and{pricing support}  
 influence the cropping pattern.With   
 modern machinery farms need few       
 workers even for 400-500 acres.The    
 soils vary from{light sandy}to{heavy  
{loam}and some{clay.}Resevoirs have    
 been dug by 3 farms.These can supply  
 rain guns  covering up to 300 acres.  
 They cover an area of 6 acres and hold
 14 million gallons of water.One is    
 stocked with course fish and is leased
 by an angling club,another is stocked 
 with trout (can be fished for a fee). </content>
