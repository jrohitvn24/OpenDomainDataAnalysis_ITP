		<content> The Northern General evolved from a   
 workhouse founded in 1878. Today it is
 a large Teaching Hospital of 1006 beds
 plus Psychiatric &amp; Mental Handicap    
 Units. In 1984 Admissions were 28910, 
 A&amp;E cases 59228, Outpatients 111464   
 and live births 2458.                 
  It is the only hospital in Britain to
 perform laser angioplasty, a technique
 pioneered by Dr. David Cumberland     
 during 1984/5 to clear blocked        
 arteries. It has been performed in the
 legs of about 20 patients so far.     
 Under local anaesthetic a laser beam  
 is directed down a tube and used to   
 burn away fatty deposits caused by    
 disease. Formerly this was done by    
 inflating a balloon in the artery or  
 by surgery.                           
  Laser angioplasty may eventually be  
 used as a cheaper, quicker and safer  
 alternative to open heart surgery.    </content>
