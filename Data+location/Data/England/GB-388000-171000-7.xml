 They employ 50_60 people on a         
 permanent basis.The number increases  
 to around 400 during the summer season
 when they extend their range of food  
 products.People are taken on in the   
 summer months on a 13_week contract.  
 This includes students on holiday.This
 means that people are not made        
 redundant. The firm try to prevent    
 anyone having to leave,but we were    
 told that they must be efficient and  
 employ only the people who can be     
 fully productive.The use of computers 
 at this site has played a large part  
 in increasing efficiency.Before,they  
 were tied in to the London office     
 computer but as the buisness has grown
 they now make their own forecasts for 
 the future.They order goods through   
 the computer.                         </content>
