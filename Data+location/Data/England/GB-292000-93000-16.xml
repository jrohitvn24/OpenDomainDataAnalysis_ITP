		<title>16Playground Games. Part 2.</title>
		<content> In the playground we also play        
 marbles. Marbles are round things,like
 footballs but smaller.They have       
 different colours in them like the    
 colours of the rainbow. Each person   
 has a marble and the first player     
 rolls it and the second must try and  
 hit it. If he does then he is allowed 
 to keep it. There are many sizes of   
 marbles. The largest is called Grandad
 Bulgies and the smallest, Cat's       
 Eyes.Another game that we play is     
 Football. What you have to do is      
 place the ball in the net with your   
 feet. You are not allowed to touch the
 ball with your hands. A person called 
 the 'Goalie' tries to stop you from   
 putting the ball in the net.The winner
 is the person who can put the most    
 balls in the net. Football is an      
 international sport.
