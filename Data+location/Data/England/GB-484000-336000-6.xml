		<content> There is a playgroup in Barrowby      
 which is held in the Memorial Hall.   
 Barrowby also has a primary school in 
 Church Street. The school has 204     
 children on roll and there are        
 seventeen people employed. There are  
 eight teachers, one caretaker, one    
 secretary and seven dinner ladies.    
 There are seven classes in the school 
 and the children are aged between five
 and eleven. The Parents' Association  
 organises many fund raising activities
 to buy extra equipment for the school.
 There are no school dinners so the    
 children bring a packed lunch. The    
 school holds evening classes          
 including:- art, keep fit, yoga,      
 dressmaking and German. Evening       
 classes are held on Mondays and       
 Thursdays. There is no school in      
 Sedgebrook. It was closed in 1984.
