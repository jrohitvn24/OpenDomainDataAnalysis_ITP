		<content> The church is dedicated to{St.Peter.  
 In 1331 it belonged to the Priory     
 of Hayling. It appears in the Domesday
 book saying that by order of William  
 the Conqueror in 1086 the Abbot of    
 Jumieges held this church.            
                                       
 There is a list of Vicars in the      
 church since 1331. The building is of 
 flint and rubble.It has two Norman    
 doorways. The North one is ornate     
 while the South doorway is more       
 simply decorated and has been blocked 
 up. On the Nave wall there is a holder
 for the hourglass to prevent sermons  
 going on too long!                    
                                       
 The{Font}has a cover of good style    
 Jacobean carvings and at its foot are 
 medieval tiles. The{Pulpit}is         
 beautifully carved Jacobean.
