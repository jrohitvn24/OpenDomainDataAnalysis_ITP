		<content> The village has mains electricity but 
 no mains gas.  An underground         
 reservoir was built on Carlton Clump  
 in 1936 and this still supplies water 
 to some parts of the village not too  
 successfully.  The village also has   
 mains water from Leicester.  There is 
 no public transport serving the       
 village and no mobile shops.          
 The Parish Church of St. Mary the     
 Virgin stands in a delightful and well
 kept churchyard is of an old          
 foundation being granted before 1081  
 to the Abbey of St. Eurol.  There was 
 a priest in Carlton in 1086.  There is
 no longer a rector living in the      
 parish which is amalgamated with six  
 other local parishes.  Services are   
 held in rotation, and sunday school   
 for young children and a teenage group
 called the God Squad.
