		<content> Congleton does not contain any large  
 fashion SHOPS.The SHOPS in Congleton  
 are mainly very small.Usually by the  
 time any reasonable FASHION clothes   
 have reached Congleton they are not   
 fashionable anymore.I  dont shop for  
 clothes in Congelton,I travel to      
 Hanley,which is about half an hour    
 away.Fashion in Congleton is centered 
 on the over 21 age group,or at least  
 the well made clothes are.There are   
 only two shops where I might buy      
 clothes from Congleton.One of which   
 sells Indian and Peruvian CLOTHES and 
 the other selling fashion clothes but 
 both are fairly expensive.            
 In Congleton there are a number of    
 SHOE shops,selling a wide range of    
 shoes to all our tasts.There are three
 shops selling what might be called    
 fashionable shoes and a couple selling
 expensive shoes.                      </content>
