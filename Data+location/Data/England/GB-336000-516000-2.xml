		<content> MOST OF THE FARMS IN THIS AREA ARE    
 SHEEP FARMS.  THE LAND AND THE        
 BUILDINGS USUALLY BELONG TO THE       
 NATIONAL TRUST, AND TENNANT FARMERS   
 RUN THE ESTATES.  MANY OF THESE HILL  
 FARMS HAVE THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF      
 MOUNTAIN AND MOORS FOR THE SHEEP TO   
 ROAM ON. IN WINTER TIME THE SHEEP ARE 
 BOUGHT DOWN TO THE FARM TO AVOID THE  
 BAD WEATHER. IN SUMMER THE SHEEP ARE  
 CLIPPED FOR WOOL.THE LAMBING SEASON   
 USUALLY TAKE PLACE IN APRIL OR MAY.   
 AROUND HERE FARMERS HAVE TO BE        
 VERY CAREFUL THAT TOURISTS OR STRAY   
 DOGS DO NOT DISTURB THE THE SHEEP. ONE
 EXAMPLE OF A SHEEP FARM IS GLENCOYNE  
 FARM JUST TO THE NORTH OF GLENRIDDING.
 SOME OF THE FARMS SUPPORT A FEW DAIRY 
 COWS AS WELL AS SHEEP AND SO HAY AND  
 SILAGE IS STORED IN JULY FOR WINTER   
 FEED. MANY FARMERS WIVES TAKE IN      
 TOURISTS TO BRING IN EXTRA MONEY.     </content>
