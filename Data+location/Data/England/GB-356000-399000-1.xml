		<content>  Ashton-in-Makerfield is on the       
 outskirts on Wigan.  It is a small    
 town but busy and the M6 runs through,
 and there is a turn off leading to    
 Liverpool Road, because of this there 
 is a lot of traffic. The High Street  
 in Ashton-in-Makerfield is Gerard     
 Street which has a lot of bus stops   
 and supermarkets, like Kwik Save and  
 Greenways, and there is a market held 
 every Tuesday and Saturday. There are 
 three secondary schools and many      
 primary schools. There are lots of    
 youth clubs and lots of Labour and    
 Conservative clubs, and churches. The 
 crime rate is low and we have our own 
 Police station. There are two free    
 newspapers the Wigan Reporter and the 
 Wigan leader. We are in the county of 
 Greater Manchester.
