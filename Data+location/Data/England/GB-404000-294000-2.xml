		<content> Local police are worried by a lack of 
 manpower.They have most complaints    
 about vandalism caused by gangs of    
 youths who terrorize some local       
 residents.In order to bring them to   
 court the police need witnesses and   
 people fear reprisals,several people  
 have been injured by these gangs.     
    The crime rate has doubled in the  
 last five years but the number of     
 police has remained the same.Many     
 crimes are alcohol related such as    
 woundings and assaults.Car theft is a 
 major problem.Juvenile crime is       
 increasing,minor damage and burglary  
 being the main offences.              
   Police hope that local people will  
 set up a community watch group to help
 protect individuals and property.They 
 fear that drug abuse and glue sniffing
 are on the increase.
