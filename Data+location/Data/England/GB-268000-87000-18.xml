		<title>18RELIGION IN CHAGFORD</title>
		<content> There are{4}types of{Churches}in      
 Chagford. These are{St. Michael's,    
{(C. of E.), the Roman Catholic Church,
{the Ebeneezer Gospel Hall and the     
{Methodist Church.}The oldest of these 
 is St. Michael's, which was consecrat_
 ed in 1261 and of which most appears  
 to have been built in the 15th Cent_  
 ury. Of the four, it has the largest  
 congregation and establishes close    
 links with the local{Primary School.} 
 The Rector also has responsibility for
{Holy Trinity, Gidleigh}and{St.Mary the
{Virgin, Throwleigh.} To assist him in 
 this onerous task retired Clergy take 
 services on Sunday in St. Michael's   
 when necessary.  The Church receives  
 many visitors throughout the year who 
 appreciate its beauty, in particular  
 the carved{rood screen.}The Churchyard
 gravestones record the passing of many
 generations of local families.        </content>
