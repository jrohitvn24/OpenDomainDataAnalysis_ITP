		<content>There are two small community hospitals
at Henley and Watlington where patients
are admitted and treated by their own  
doctor.  There are no facilities for X-
ray or surgery.  Most of the patients  
suffer from chronic illnesses          
associated with old age.  Some acute   
medical cases are admitted and people  
needing convalescent care transferred  
from larger hospitals to be nearer     
home.  Elderly patients and chronically
sick of any age are admitted for check-
ups to maintain health standards and to
provide relief for relatives.  Day     
centres provide meals and hairdressing 
services for needy housebound          
patients; they are driven to and from  
hospital by ambulance.  A hospital car 
service run by volunteers can also     
provide transport to hospital or       
doctors surgery if needed.
