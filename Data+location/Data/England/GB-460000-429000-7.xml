		<title>07BRAYTON TOLL HOUSE</title>
		<content> The{toll house}has a lot of history   
 behind it. It has 5 rooms and 2       
 aviaries. It was built in{1771.}The   
{toll collecting room}was built half   
 hexagonal in shape so the collector   
 could see up and down the road. Mr.   
 Prescott Barr is the present owner. He
 has newspaper cuttings of the{toll    
{house.}One is about a car that smashed
 through the toll collecting room. It  
 did not take long to repair. The      
 kitchen used to be a bathroom which is
 now moved into the back room. The     
 walls are made of stucco which he     
 showed us when we went out of the     
 door. The birds he has are from all   
 over the world - Australia, America   
 etc. It is reputed that{Dick Turpin   
 jumped over the toll gate on{Black    
{Bess}to avoid paying his toll to York.
