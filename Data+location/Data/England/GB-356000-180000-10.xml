		<title>10Pocket Money in Patchway</title>
		<content>                                       
   I spend my pocket money on sweets,  
 toys and gifts for my mum and dad.  I 
 get varying amounts of pocket money.  
 Sometimes I keep my money to buy      
 presents for Christmas and Mothers day
 and birthdays.  Sometimes I save it up
 for my holiday to buy things there.   
   When I get sweets I normally get    
 Chewits or Opal Fruits.  When I get   
 toys, I normally get games.  I get    
 chocolates or ornaments for my mum.   
 For my dad I get Bon-Bons or Jelly    
 Babies.  I like buying presents for my
 mum and dad and sometimes I buy little
 presents for my cat and my brother,   
 like a squeaky toy mouse or Battle    
 Action Force, which is a comic that my
 brother likes.  My brother also likes 
 Nutty with Bananaman in it which is   
 great to read in the day.
