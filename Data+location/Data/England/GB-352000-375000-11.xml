		<title>11ST.LAWRENCE PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content>  The church stands on high ground     
 overlooking the village of Frodsham,  
 and is built entirely of local red    
 sandstone. In 1986 it will celebrate  
 its 900th Anniversary, having been    
 recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086.
  The church tower contains eight      
 bells. The treble has the highest note
 and the tenor, the heaviest bell, the 
 lowest.                               
  A ten year old local schoolgirl      
 writes, "My family has been ringing   
 for four generations since 1900. I    
 like bell ringing because it is an    
 unusual hobby. We practice for 3 hours
 every Friday night. We ring for Sunday
 services, some weddings and funerals, 
 for Royal occasions and to welcome in 
 each New Year."                       
  The church is open to visitors three 
 days each week.
