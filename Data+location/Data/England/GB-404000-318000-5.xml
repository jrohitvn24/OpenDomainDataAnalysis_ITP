		<title>05EMPLOYMENT, RUGELEY</title>
		<content> Rugeley is a small industrial and     
 market town in rural Staffordshire.   
 People living in Rugeley and Colton   
 work for the 5 main employers - Lea   
 Hall colliery, the 2 power stations,  
 Armitage Shanks, Thorn Automation and 
 Celcon. There are 2 small industrial  
 estates in the Trent Valley and 1 at  
 Brereton nearby. Rugeley is 8 miles   
 from other towns and so provides work 
 in shops and services. The surrounding
 countryside is good farmland but few  
 people work in farming. Many people   
 from Rugeley work outside the town,   
 travelling as far as Birmingham,      
 Stoke-on-Trent and Derby. The local   
 unemployment level is 18% compared    
 with the national average of 13%. This
 is higher than the unemployment level 
 in neighbouring towns but should fall 
 as new jobs are attracted into Rugeley
 with government aid.                  </content>
