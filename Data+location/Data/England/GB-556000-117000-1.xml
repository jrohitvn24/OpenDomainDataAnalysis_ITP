		<title>01GENERAL REVIEW</title>
		<content> A rural part of East Sussex with large
 areas of intensively managed          
 grassland,scattered areas of woodland 
 and rough grazing land.Horam is the   
 main residential and shopping area.The
 Merrydown Cider Factory is to be found
 here and is a major source of         
 employment. Some still work on the    
 land in fencing,farming and in        
 nurseries, but many travel to larger  
 towns for employment.Public transport 
 is limited and nearly every family    
 rely on owning a car.The primary      
 school for the area is to be found at 
 Maynards Green.There is a lack of     
 commercial entertainment but this is  
 compensated by a number of voluntary  
 organisations                         
 e.g.Scouts,Guides,Ramblers,Youth Club.
