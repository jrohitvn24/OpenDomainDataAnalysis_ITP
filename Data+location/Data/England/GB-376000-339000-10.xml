Our school is a Church of England      
School, and therefore has close        
connections with the church. The       
nearest one to the school is in        
Whitmore and this is the church that is
most frequently visited by the pupils. 
                                       
The Rector has three churches to look  
after; Whitmore, Maer and Chappel      
Chorlton. The School is equally welcome
in all of these churches, but Whitmore 
is slightly larger and the nearest.    
                                       
Every Friday the Rector (the Reverend  
John Porter) comes to school to take   
our assembly. He also takes special    
services such as harvest, Christmas,   
Easter and a Candlemass service. For   
some of these the pupils go to one of  
the three churches by coach.
