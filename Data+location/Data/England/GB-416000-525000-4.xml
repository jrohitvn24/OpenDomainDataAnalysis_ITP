 For almost two centuries,coal mining  
 was the mainstay of the area,but the  
 1960's saw the end of deep mining and 
 only occasional opencast coal working 
 has taken place since then.A number of
 factories were built between the two  
 world wars,and many of these are at   
 the end of their useful life,some now 
 lying empty and one having been demol-
 ished in 1985.Some industrial building
 was done in the 1960's;these have been
 badly hit by recession and one,which  
 employs some 300 workers,has recently 
 announced that it will close at the   
 end of 1985 unless there is a signif- 
 icant increase in demand for its prod-
 ucts.A number of specialised manufact-
 ories built since 1970 in the east of 
 the block are fairly successful,and a 
 number of "small business units"have  
 recently been built by the council.   </content>
