		<content> LOCAL PEOPLE INTERVIEWED, JUNE 1985   
                                       
 Mrs. Pickard has been the Filleigh    
 Post-mistress for 18 years.  She sells
 sweets, cigarettes, groceries and     
 stamps.                               
 She went to Filleigh School when she  
 was young.  In the playground they    
 played hopscotch, rounders and tag.   
 There were about 50 children.  The    
 names of the teachers were Miss       
 Binding, Miss Brag, Miss Potter and   
 Mrs. Jones.                           
 When she left school she worked in the
 school canteen.  She did not enjoy    
 this as she had to cook for about a   
 hundred children and thought it was   
 hard work.                            
 When she was young her hobby was      
 knitting. During her holidays she did 
 not go away but stayed at home.
