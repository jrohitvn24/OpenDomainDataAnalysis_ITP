		<title>08PLAYING FOOTBALL.</title>
		<content> My name is Robert Hill and I like     
 playing football.My favourite team is 
 Manchester United.Every Saturday I    
 meet a group of friends on the local  
 cricket field.Two teams are picked by 
 the captains who toss a coin,(if we've
 got one,),to see who has first        
 choice.4 coats are used for posts and 
 one person from each team stands      
 between each set of posts to prevent  
 the other team from scoring.I play    
 football wearing a kit of red shorts  
 and a red and white shirt in the      
 Liverpool colours.Some of the group   
 don't have any kit,but this does'nt   
 matter.Football boots are hard shoes  
 with studs on the soles.They allow you
 to kick the ball very hard which you  
 frequently have to do when passing the
 ball or shooting at the goals in the  
 hope of scoring,which is the object of
 the game.                             </content>
