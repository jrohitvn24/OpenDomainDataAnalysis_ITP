		<title>12RAMPTON PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Our primary school serves Rampton,    
 Stokeham, Treswell and Cottam.The main
 block was built in 1914 and the new   
 block in 1960. This has two           
 classrooms, one for the infants and   
 the other for the lower juniors. In   
 the old block two classrooms are used 
 by pupils and two are resource rooms. 
 The school has attractive grounds -   
 a large playing field and two         
 playgrounds. The old Headmaster's     
 house is part of the premises and has 
 an attractive orchard garden to it.   
 There are four teachers at the school,
 Mrs Cade, Miss Lane, Mrs Marsh and Mr 
 Presley. Our school day starts at     
 9.00am and finishes at 3.45pm. Lunch  
 is from 12.00pm to 1.30pm. Dinners are
 cooked on the premises, but some      
 children prefer to bring sandwiches.
