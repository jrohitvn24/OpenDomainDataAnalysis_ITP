		<title>20BORDON TRANSPORT.</title>
		<content>   William Cobbett travelled through   
 Woolmer Forest in 1817 on a coach road
 which is now called Forest Road. Ten  
 years later a turnpike road linking   
 Aldershot to Petersfield passed       
 through Bordon and in 1865 a road from
 Longmoor to the west of Bordon was    
 built. In 1903 the War Dept.          
 transferred 60 army huts from Longmoor
 to Bordon Camp and built a narrow     
 guage railway for this purpose. It was
 converted to a military training      
 railway and eventually linked Bordon  
 to Liss and then to Portsmouth.Around 
 the same time the Bordon to Bentley   
 line was built.They functioned mainly 
 as supply lines to Bordon Camp but    
 also carried passengers.Both lines    
 were closed by 1968 but the area is   
 well serviced by buses to Liphook,    
 Aldershot,Petersfield and Basingstoke.
 However most people travel by car.    </content>
