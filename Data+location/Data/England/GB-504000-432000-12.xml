 This is a game played mostly by girls.
 It is where you have two balls which  
 are thrown against a wall. It is a lot
 like juggling as the balls come at you
 one after the other.                  
{Jacks                                 
 This is a game played by boys and     
 girls. The game has six small plastic 
 "jacks" and a ball. The idea is to    
 bounce the ball and pick up so many   
 jacks, beginning with one, then two   
 and so on. Finally you have to try to 
 pick up all six jacks during one      
 bounce of the ball.                   
{Queeny                                
 The game is played mostly by girls.   
 One girl is Queeny and she throws the 
 ball behind her. Whoever catches the  
 ball has to hide it and {Queeny}has to
 try and guess who has it.  A wrong    
 guess and the ball hider is{Queeny.   </content>
