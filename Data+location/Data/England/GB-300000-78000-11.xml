		<title>11STRAIGHT POINT RIFLE RANGE</title>
		<content> My Dad is a corporal in the Royal     
 Marines. He has told me about Straight
 Point Rifle Range which is on the     
 cliffs over looking Sandy Bay. My Dad 
 has practised shooting in the ranges  
 quite a few times. It's used by       
 recruits in training. Often they are  
 in small groups. When we went to Sandy
 Bay we saw several men lying on the   
 ground and two men standing up        
 instructing them.The ranges are       
 surrounded by a big fence.There are   
 several ranges from 30 metres to 600  
 metres where they test different types
 of guns.My dad's favourite gun is the 
 Uzi.Once two men were shot because    
 they were messing around with the     
 guns.Holiday makers from the Devon    
 Cliffs Holiday Park have complained   
 about the noise of the guns.The ranges
 are on the cliffs because stray       
 bullets will go into the sea.         </content>
