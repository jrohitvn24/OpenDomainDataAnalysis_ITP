		<content>   In Egerton, the Church is the heart 
 of the Community.  The earliest houses
 and many of the most recent cluster   
 around St James's.  Our villagers     
 built the church as a place of        
 worship, a finger pointing to heaven, 
 a reminder of God in our midst.  As a 
 place to pray, a registry of          
 village life, in birth, marriage and  
 death, of celebration and remembrance,
 of meetings, schooling and music, as a
 depot for the relief of the poor and  
 sick; As a springboard for community  
 life;  As a heart to their society.   
   St James's still stands, sharing our
 sorrows and joys.  Celebrating in     
 God's love, family ties; understanding
 frailties and fractiousness. As ever, 
 showing God among us, awaiting our    
 recognition.
