		<content> Apart from the AA, there is no large  
 employer in the block. A firm in Wid- 
 merpool named "Stikies" makes plastic 
 stickers to order. A light engineering
 firm based on Manor Farm does welding 
 of farm gates, etc. A large nursery   
 supplies plants to the trade, and     
 there is a joinery on the Old Hall    
 Estate. In Wysall there is a builder  
 (member of an old village family) who 
 does most of the local house buil-    
 ding. There is also a garage that does
 repairs of motor vehicles and machin- 
 ery. On Thurlby Lane (N.E. corner of  
 block) there is a rose grower. Many   
 residents travel to work in towns     
 or cities such as Nottingham,         
 Loughborough and Leicester.
