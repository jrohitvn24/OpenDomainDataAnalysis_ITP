		<title>07Haslingden By-Pass</title>
		<content> The{Haslingden By-pass}was opened on  
 December 4th. 1981 by{Rt.Hon. Kenneth 
{Clark}who was the transport minister  
 at the time. Work originally started  
 in 1967. By the time it was opened the
 By-pass was 2.5 miles in length and   
 had cost Â£10 million to build. The    
 first phase was the construction of a 
 large roundabout at{Road End.}Over    
 40,000 tons of rock from the local    
 quarry had to be transported to the   
 site to bring the height of the       
 roundabout up to the level of existing
 roads.Some houses had to be demolished
 in the{Hud Hey}area and part of{      
{Victoria Park}was taken. In the{      
{Jubilee Road}area construction was    
 made more difficult by land           
 subsidence.                           
 The By-pass is now very important as  
 it links the M65 to the M66, relieving
 other local roads.                    </content>
