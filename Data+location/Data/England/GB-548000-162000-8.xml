		<title>08The Old Bakery.</title>
		<content> On Tuesday 26th June,Class 3 went to  
visit Mrs Birk's house which is the old
bakery of Chelsfield.The history of the
house is interesting.At first Mrs Birks
did not like the name"The Old Bakery"  
so she let the lady next door have it  
for hers.One day Mrs.Birks received a  
letter saying that she could not change
the name of the house unless she got   
special permission.                    
 The old Bakery is over 300 years and  
is a listed building.People in the     
village have made a soceity to protect 
old buildings and make sure that they  
do not get knocked down or changed.    
 In the past the village baker would   
bake the bread inside the bakery then  
take it round the village on his horse 
and cart.The baker would keep his horse
in his garden and every day he had to  
lead it through his front room and out 
the back into the stables at the rear. </content>
