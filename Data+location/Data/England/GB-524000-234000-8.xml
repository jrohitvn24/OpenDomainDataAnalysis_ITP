		<title>08Trade N.E. of Baldock</title>
		<content>  There is little trade outside Baldock
 except for a few farms selling farm   
 produce{at the gate}and Dwarf Pyramids
 which sell apples and pears from their
 orchard at Bygrave. These activities  
 are obviously related to the          
 importance of the private car.        
                                       
  The cash and carry warehouse just    
 outside Baldock on the A505 is based  
 on the same economic principle, as are
 the garages in Baldock, two of which  
 offer accident car collection and     
 repair, a reflection of the dangerous 
 section of A505 in this block.        
                                       
  The few shops in square 9 are either 
{service based,}eg. hairdressers,      
 building societies, estate agents, or 
{specialist shops,}eg. antiques, watch 
 maker/repairer,DIY.
