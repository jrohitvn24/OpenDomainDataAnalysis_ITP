		<title>06Pig farming</title>
		<content> Some farms in this area have pig units
 which vary in size from 30-250 sows   
 there are no very big units.          
  Pigs are kept inside controlled      
 environments,often in converted       
 buildings or in purpose built sheds.  
 They are fed on a ration of ground    
 cereals, wheat, barley, soya and fish 
 meal, also whey and skimmed milk.     
  Pigs convert wellif kept in warm well
 ventilated housing and fed and watered
 correctly.                            
  They are moved around the units from 
 farrowing to weaning houses, fattening
 and then finally sold for either pork 
 meat or bacon.                        
  Some farmers sell the weaners to     
 other farms for fattening.            
  The average litter is 9 and the      
 gestation period 114-118 days, sows   
 make good mothers.
