		<title>08Youth Activities</title>
		<content>In our survey of the area,we found that
one of the biggest complaints was the  
lack of activities and facilities for  
young people.The nearest Sports        
Hall/Swimming Bath is in Cheadle, and  
the nearest cinema is in Uttoxeter.    
There are, however, two Brownie Packs  
and two Guide Companies all of which   
meet in St Thomas'R.C. School.The boys 
have to go into Cheadle for Cubs and   
Scouts.                                
There are two football teams for boys  
in Tean and the Cricket Club does have 
a boys' section.                       
Occasionaly Discos and Social evenings 
for Teenagers are held in Tean Village 
Hall,but they are not regular events.
