		<title>02BECKLEY VILLAGE 1985</title>
		<content>Beckley is a small village about five  
miles to the N.E. of Oxford. It is on a
hillside overlooking Otmoor, a low     
lying, wet area. A village was here in 
Saxon times and the Romans once built a
road over Otmoor and through Beckley. A
modern row of old people's bungalows is
called Roman Way. The oldest building  
in Beckley is the church which dates   
from Norman times. The church tower can
be seen as you approach the village.   
One other landmark is the 550 feet     
television and radio mast. This        
transmits all four television channels 
and radio programmes. The old village  
is very picturesque with stone cottages
covered with roses. Modern bungalows   
and houses along the Woodperry Road    
opposite the village playing field     
enjoy fine views across Otmoor.
