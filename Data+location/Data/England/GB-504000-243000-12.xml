		<title>12RADIOACTIVE WASTE DISPOSAL</title>
		<content> BEDFORDSHIRE AGAINST NUCLEAR DUMPING  
                                       
 BAND is a non-politcal organisation   
 working locally to stop NIREX dumping 
 radioactive waste at Elstow Depot.    
 They do not agree with the proposal   
 for shallow burial but suggest that   
 waste should be stored on the sites of
 nuclear power stations.  This is where
 waste is stored at present and can be 
 constantly monitored for leakage.     
 BAND believe that since October 1983  
 the Government has been "hell bent on 
 coming to Elstow".  In the document   
 they supplied to us they state that it
 is not the Oxford clay that attracted 
 NIREX as it is more irregular here    
 than elsewhere, but the fact that the 
 land is owned by the Central          
 Electricity Generating Board; a parent
 organisation of NIREX.
