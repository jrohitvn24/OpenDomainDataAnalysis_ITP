		<title>20HOLTON AREA GENERAL VIEW</title>
		<content> The general impression given to casual
 visitors of this part of Lincolnshire 
 is of a flattish, sparsely populated, 
 peaceful agricultural countyside.     
 However on closer inspection there is 
 much of interest to be found that is  
 not initially apparent. The pace of   
 life may at times be slower than in   
 urban areas but there is a great deal 
 to attract people to this rural area. 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
 The information for these pages was   
 compiled by Members of Holton         
 Beckering and District Womens'        
 Instiute and their families. We are   
 very grateful to all those who have   
 taken part in any way and for the     
 enthusiasm shown for the project by a 
 wide range of people in the area.     </content>
