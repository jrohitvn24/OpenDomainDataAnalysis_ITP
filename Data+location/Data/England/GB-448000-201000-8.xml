		<title>08 Shopping in Boars Hill</title>
		<content>                                       
   There is a small supermarket on     
Boars Hill which also serves as a sub  
Post Office and a sports shop in the   
Hinksey area. People in the area tend  
to do most of their shopping in        
Abingdon or Oxford. The most popular   
food shops are Tesco and Gateway       
supermarkets in Abingdon and Sainsbury 
supermarkets in Oxford and Cowley.     
Tesco run a free bus service on two    
days each week which weaves its way    
through the area to the supermarket and
returns by the same route 2 hours      
later. This service is well used,      
particularly by older people. Mobile   
shops coming in to the area include a  
fish van, a mobile grocery shop and    
milk roundsmen and bread delivery vans.
