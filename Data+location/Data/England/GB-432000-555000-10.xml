		<title>10SOUTH HYLTON RIVERSIDE</title>
		<content> The banks of the River Wear, once     
 heavily industrialised, now much in   
 dereliction, are slowly being         
 reclaimed, landscaped and turned into 
 a series of riverside parks. In South 
 Hylton industrial sites have been     
 levelled and grass and trees have been
 planted. In some areas tables and     
 benches have been positioned and      
 footpaths upgraded. The river is tidal
 and at high tide water sports often   
 take place. There is a rowing club    
 with a clubhouse and slipway on the   
 south bank. The South Hylton Sea      
 Scouts go canoeing or sailing. Power  
 boats use the river for water skiing. 
 There is a slipway outside the Golden 
 Lion public house, itself once a      
 derelict building.There are raft races
 and a tug of war across the river.
