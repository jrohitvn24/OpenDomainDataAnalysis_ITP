 The area around{Kington}has long      
 associations with{St Arilda.}Legend   
 says she was a Christian girl killed  
 by a Roman soldier for refusing to    
 make love with him. She is buried in  
 the crypt of{Gloucester Cathedral.}The
 stones of ST Arilda's well are said to
 be stained red by her blood. In fact  
 it is due to mineral deposits.        
 Another theory is she was a Celtic    
 goddess of the spring,  found on{St   
{Arild's farm.}The water from this     
 spring is very cold and clear.        
 Nearby is{St Arild's House,}built in  
 Queen Anne's reign,with no passages.It
 is said to have a friendly ghost.     
 There is an{old cider press}at this   
 house, left over from when people used
 to bring their apples to be crushed.  
{Cider}is still made in this area.     </content>
