		<content> The community association was formed  
 as the Hartside school building was   
 being completed and the school        
 building was always intended to be    
 used for the dual purpose of Education
 and recreation.                       
 During the day there are facilities   
 for the elderly to meet and perhaps   
 have some small refreshments whilst   
 during the evening the courses offered
 are very varied.These include Bridge, 
 Chess, Badminton, Bowls, German,      
 French, Dancing for all ages at       
 differing times,Keep Fit,a mother and 
 toddler group, Art classes and a group
 for Self-defence.                     
 The centre is run by three paid       
 wardens each working 9 hours a week   
 abd relies on many volunteer helpers. 
 They draw from all over the Crook area
 the large numbers of people who       
 attend.                               </content>
