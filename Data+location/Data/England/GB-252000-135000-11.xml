		<title>11MARWOOD S. THE PARISHES</title>
		<content>    There are two main parishes in this
 area,Marwood and Ashford.Marwood      
 church is much larger with a tower and
 Ashford is very small and with a      
 spire.                                
    At Marwood church we walked up 106 
 steps to the top of the tower and had 
 a good view of Dr.Smart's Gardens.The 
 coat of arms on the wall had just been
 newly painted.The choir seats were    
 miserichords and if you fell asleep   
 they crashed down with a loud         
 bang! There  were at least 60 bright  
 new kneelers in the church which had  
 been made by people in the parish.At  
 the back of the church there is a     
 closed area for little children to    
 play during the service.              
    At Ashford church we noticed most  
 the anchor gravestone.
