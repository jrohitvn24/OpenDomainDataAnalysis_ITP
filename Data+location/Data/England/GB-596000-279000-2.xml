		<title>02LODGE FARM, GASTHORPE</title>
		<content> Lodge Farm is run by Mr. Kemp and his 
 four men.  He grows barley and sugar  
 beet.  He does not have animals       
 although there was a horse stud until 
 about 40 years ago.  The most         
 successful of his crops is the winter 
 barley. It covers 500 of the 780      
 acres, 130 acres is sugar beet and the
 rest is grass.  The crops are usually 
 harvested in late July and August.    
 Mr. Kemp uses 4 tractors, 2 Massey-   
 Fergesons and a combine harvester.    
 The people who work on the farm live  
 in Gasthorpe, Garboldisham and Blo    
 Norton. The present farmers on this   
 land are moving soon because the land 
 owners are repossessing the farm.
