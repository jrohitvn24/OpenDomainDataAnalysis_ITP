and get dressed. I go downstairs and   
have my breakfast. I go back upstairs  
and clean my teeth and get my things   
ready for school. I walk to school with
my friends and when the teacher blows  
the whistle we go inside to our        
classroom. Our teacher takes the       
register and the dinner numbers, then  
wego down to the hall for assembly.
