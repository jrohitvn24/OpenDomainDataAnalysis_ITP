		<title>06THE SELSEY LIFEBOAT PART 1</title>
		<content>    The first Lifeboat came here in    
 1861,it was called{"The Friend".      
 Since then there have been seven      
 Lifeboats.The one at the moment,the   
 8th,is named{"The City of London".}It 
 is called out about 12 times a year   
 and so far all the Selsey Lifeboats   
 have saved 663 lives. Every year there
 is a{Lifeboat day}which includes a    
 rescue and the helicopter comes as    
 well as the Lifeboat.The{Lifeboat     
{Station}we have,is not the original   
 one.That was washed away by the sea so
 they had to build another one."The    
 City of London" is 47 feet long and is
 powered by two general motors each    
 with 425 horse power.It runs on diesel
 and at top speed can go up to 20      
 knots. It uses 38 gallons an hour.The 
 Coxswain is Mr.Mike Grant, Mr.Woodland
 is 2nd Coxswain and Mr.Wood is the    
 mechanic.                             </content>
