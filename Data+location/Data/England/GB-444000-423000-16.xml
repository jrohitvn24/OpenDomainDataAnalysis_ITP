 One of the customs of Airedale is that
 it holds a festival{Gala}each year.We 
 interviewed Mrs.A.Beedle at the       
 Airedale Family centre.She told us    
 that the first{Gala}was held in       
 1979.Welfare worker Mrs M.Lowe wanted 
 to commemorate the International Year 
 of the Child.There have been five more
{Galas}since then.On{Gala}day decorated
 lorries drive round the street.In 1979
 &amp; 1980 our school decorated a lorry.  
 This is called a float.Our first float
 looked like a castle and we dressed up
 in long dresses.The boys wore doublet 
 and hose.We were black and white      
 minstrels on the second one.The       
 children have games,sports and        
 rides.Money made on past{Gala}days has
 gone to childrens charities,Cancer    
 Relief,Gingerbread,Muscular Sclerosis.
