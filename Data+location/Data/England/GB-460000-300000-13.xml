		<content>{ }We asked several people who lived   
 in,or near,the area how it had changed
 in the last 40 years.There were more  
 large Victorian houses with large     
 gardens and open fields.The land which
 is now St.John the Baptist School was 
 a farm and clinic.Like today          
 industry,except for a few small       
 businesses,has never been situated in 
 this area.It has always been          
 residential.What kind of transport did
 you use?Trams were still the most     
 common form and more people walked or 
 cycled than today.What entertainments 
 were nearby?Few entertainments were   
 nearby,hardly anyone had television.So
 we had to make our own,or listen to   
 the radio.Have the shops changed since
 1945?Yes-there were many more smaller 
 local shops, one in nearly every      
 street where you could get most items.
