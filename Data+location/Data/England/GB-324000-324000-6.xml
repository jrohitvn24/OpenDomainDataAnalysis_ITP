 The games we play at school are quite 
 easy to play.We play "stagger" which  
 is when two people hold hands count to
 ten and then run after someone.When   
 they have got all the people the last 
 one who was tuck is on.Another game we
 play is "arch tick" which is when     
 someone is on and when the other      
 people are caught they put one hand on
 a wall.Then another person who isn't  
 on comes and runs under there arm then
 they are free.The other game is "stuck
 in the mud" which is when someone is  
 on and they tick someone,that person  
 stops and puts their legs apart then  
 someone who hasn't been tuck goes     
 under their legs then their free.
