		<content> At half past seven I got              
 up,dressed in                         
 my old clothes and helped dad with the
 cows then I got changed had bacon and 
 egg and a slice of toast and came to  
 school by taxi.We had assembly        
 all together and then maths.I did     
 fractions and long                    
 multiplication.After playtime we did  
 English and reading and after dinner I
 did some work on the Domesday         
 survey.We did reading, handwork and   
 rounders until 3.30 when the school   
 taxi picked me up. I had tea, bread   
 and jam and went to help on the farm. 
 I played on my bike.At nine oclock I  
 went in, had supper,watched           
 television and went to bed at ten     
 oclock.
