 "M1"STANDS FOR MOTORWAY ONE.IT RUNS   
FROM LONDON TO LEEDS.IT CARRIES ROUGHLY
TWENTY-FIVE MILLION VEHICLES A YEAR.ON 
AVERAGE THE MIDDLE LANE IS USED MOST   
BECAUSE MOST VEHICLES TRAVEL ON THE    
MIDDLE LANE.NEXT TO THE OUTSIDE LANE   
THERE IS A HARD SHOULDER,THIS IS ON    
BOTH SIDES OF THE MOTORWAY.IF YOUR     
VEHICLE IS BADLY DAMAGED,YOU PULL OVER 
TO THE HARD SHOULDER.SOMEWHERE ALONG   
THE HARD SHOULDER AT INTERVALS ARE A.A.
TELEPHONES.ALSO ALONG THE MOTORWAY ARE 
SERVICE STATIONS.SOMETIMES (NEARLY     
ALWAYS)THERE ARE CRASHES ALONG THE     
MOTORWAY,AND THERE ARE VERY LONG       
TRAFFIC JAMS.THEN THE HARD SHOULDER IS 
USED AS A WAY THROUGH FOR VEHICLES OR  
FOR AMBULANCES,FIRE ENGINES,POLICE CARS
AND THE A.A. THE MOTORWAY IS USUALLY   
PACKED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RUSH HOUR.
