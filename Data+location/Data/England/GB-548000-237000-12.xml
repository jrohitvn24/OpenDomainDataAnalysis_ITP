   The church is between 600 &amp; 800     
 years old.It was built in the 12th to 
 14th centuary but since then it has   
 been renovated.Richard Carhill the    
{vicar}of Littlebury church has lived  
 in Littlebury for two years,he moved  
 to Littlebury because he thinks it is 
 a nice village and because the church 
 was vacant.He also moved there because
 he could be near a place to shop,     
 (Saffron Walden or Cambridge).        
                                       
 Saffron Walden is 2 miles away.       
     Cambridge is 15 miles away.
