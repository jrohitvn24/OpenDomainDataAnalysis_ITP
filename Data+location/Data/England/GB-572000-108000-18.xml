		<title>18INTERVIEW WITH P.C. PALMER</title>
		<content>    P.C. Palmer is the{Pebsham         
{Community policeman from East Bexhill.
 Bexhill does not have a very high     
 crime rate, but there is{some         
{vandalism,}such as aerosol paint      
 spraying and{some burglary.}The most  
{common crime in Pebsham is burglary   
 and there are only 2 or 3 crimes a    
 week there. These are usually         
 committed during the day. He thought a
{Neighbourhood Watch Scheme would help 
 prevent more. He said that he liked   
 his job and meeting the public, but he
 thought that his{uniform could be     
{improved,}because his jacket was too  
 tight and when he had to run his      
 helmet often fell off. He had been    
 hurt twice; once in the back and once 
 in the mouth. The worst crime he had  
 dealt with was a robbery valued at    
 Â£250,000. Generally{more police}were  
{needed}to fight unsolved crimes.      </content>
