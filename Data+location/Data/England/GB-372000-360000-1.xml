		<content> The area is{mainly agricultural}with  
 almost 100% of the available farming  
 land being grassland for dairy cattle.
 Within the area there are two centres 
 of population,the town of Sandbach and
 the village of Elworth.               
{Sandbach}is a small market town with a
 population of appoximately 15,000.It  
 has over the last 20 years expanded   
 considerably.This is due to the fact  
 that it has become a commuter belt    
 which allows people to travel to work 
 in cities such as Manchester,         
 Birmingham and Liverpool within an    
 hour on the nearby M6 motorway.       
 The village of{Elworth}has expanded as
 a residential area in the past 10     
 years.Up until 1979 the village       
 contained the main employer (Fodens)  
 for the area.This is not the case now 
 and smaller industries have replaced  
 the large employer.{                  </content>
