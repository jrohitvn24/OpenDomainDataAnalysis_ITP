		<content> The east door has been there more     
 than seven hundred years. Cromwell's  
 army rested there once. They open the 
 west door for marragies. Through the  
 door on the right is a font. The      
 seats are three centuries old but they
 have some new chairs now. In the      
 church it can seat two hundred        
 comfortably. Fifty people go to the   
{U.R.C.}of which twenty are children.  
 The church has an organ.              
 There is only one church in{Rushton}as
 the old church,{St.Peter's}was        
 demolished  in 1799.                  
 The church is well attended and it    
 plays an active part in the life of   
 the village.
