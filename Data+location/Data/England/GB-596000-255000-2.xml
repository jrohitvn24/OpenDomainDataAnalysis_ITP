		<content> Agriculture is the most important     
 industry of the area. The farms are   
 all{owner-occupied, family farms      
 mainly bought in C.1920. Eight employ 
 no labour other than family and five  
 have outside workers, generally living
 nearby. A total of 31 people work the 
 1000 ha. of farmland comprising the 13
 farms. The soil is mainly heavy       
{boulder clay}with underground pipe    
 drainage making it ideally suited to  
{intensive arable}production.There is  
 little grassland of any description.  
 Large modern{farm buildings}are not   
 generally conspicuous on the landscape
 - a few are situated among the trees  
 on the edge of Rattlesden airfield,and
 others blend well with a generally    
 unspoilt countryside. Many of the     
 traditional farm buildings have been  
 adapted for modern uses; principally  
 the storage of grain.                 </content>
