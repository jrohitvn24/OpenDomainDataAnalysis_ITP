		<content> Near to summer the classes go on      
 school excursions to places like      
 Sewerby Park or Hornsea Potteries etc.
 In the autumn the school has a Harvest
 Festival which parents can go to. At  
 Christmas the children present a      
 Nativity play for the parents to      
 watch. Some children help with the    
 gardening in the quadrangle as well as
 going on small outings.               
{BRIEF HISTORY OF THE SCHOOL.}         
{18.4.1939.}The school was opened, for

{6.9.1949}-The school was due to be
