		<title>10JARROW CENTRE</title>
		<content> The central area of Jarrow houses a   
 large shopping complex which was      
 opened in 1961 on a slum clearance    
 site.It is a compact centre with a    
 large car-park on the south side.The  
 shops are arranged along broad traffic
 free precincts.                       
 Since its opening, there have been    
 many changes in the businesses.The    
 highest block now houses the          
 D.H.S.S.office and a large            
 supermarket.There were four large     
 furniture shops but today there is    
 only one.Beside the shopping centre   
 there is a large bronze statue of the 
 Vikings erected to commemorate the    
 time in Jarrow's history when Viking  
 invaders sacked the town and its      
 monastery.                            
 Opposite the shopping precinct on the 
 north side stands the old town hall   
 which is now the education office.    </content>
