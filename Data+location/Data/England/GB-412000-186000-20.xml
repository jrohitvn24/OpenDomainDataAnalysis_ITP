		<content> represent where we were on the        
 map.When we got back to school we went
 to dinner. For dinner I had Texas     
 hash,boiled rice, peas and carrots and
 for pudding I had icecream and        
 chocolate crackle. From one           
 o'clock to Two I did a piece of       
 writing. Then we played rounders.I    
 went home at ten past three and played
 in the garden until my mum called me  
 in for tea.After tea, I went out to   
 play with my friends. We played       
 football. After that I came in to     
 watch T.V. Then I washed, brushed my  
 teeth and went to bed.
