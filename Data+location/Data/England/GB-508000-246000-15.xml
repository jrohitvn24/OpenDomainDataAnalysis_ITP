		<title>15Oil Seed Rape</title>
		<content>    In the early summer the fields are 
 bright  yellow  and  this is the sign 
 Oil Seed Rape  is growing.In our area 
 there are  many  fields  of  Oil Seed 
 Rape.                                 
                                       
    The  seeds  contain  35% to 40% of 
 oil, which  is  used  as  cooking oil.
 Within the European Economic Comunity 
 at the  present  time  demand exceeds 
 supply, so the price is attractive to 
 farmers.                              
                                       
    When some of the pods have ripened 
 the  crop is cut down. This stops the 
 ripe  pods  from  bursting  open  and 
 spilling  out the oil seeds. Then the 
 combine  harvester  comes  along  and 
 threshes all the seeds  from the pods.
