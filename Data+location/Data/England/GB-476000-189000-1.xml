		<content>  This rural area is in Buckinghamshire
and lies on the southern part of the   
Chiltern Hills, most of it is over 300 
feet above sea level. To the S.W. and  
N.E. the hills rise to over 600 feet.  
The area is bisected by a deepish      
narrow valley.                         
  The centre lies some eight miles from
the towns of Henley and High Wycombe,  
whilst somewhat nearer is the riverside
town of Marlow.                        
  About a quarter of the area is       
densely wooded, much of it beech. In   
reafforestation conifers are planted as
hosts to newly planted beech.          
  The villages of Turville, Fingest and
Skirmett are in the valley, whilst     
Frieth is on a small plateau, over 500 
feet above sea level, to the S.E.      
  An intermittent stream, rising in the
area of Skirmett, flows south down the 
valley to the River Thames.            </content>
