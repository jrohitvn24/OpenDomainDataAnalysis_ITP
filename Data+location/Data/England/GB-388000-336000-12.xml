		<title>12KIBLESTONE SCOUT CAMP</title>
		<content>  Land let to the Scouts from 1927 by  
 Ronald Copeland a Pottery             
 manufacturer.  Formerly the site of   
 Kibblestone Hall but also extending   
 across the road and down to the A.51  
 trunk road.  In 1960 the Scouts       
 purchased the site which included Camp
 and Training Centre, Wetmore Mill and 
 the Mill House.  At this time a full  
 time Warden was installed, Mr. Donald 
 Rowe, and in 1985 still does this job.
  The Stoke District Scouts own and    
 administer the site and have Scouts   
 Guides and International visitors to  
 the site.  It is beautifully wooded   
 with superb shows of Daffodils and    
 Bluebells.There is an enormous variety
 of trees encouraged by Mr. C. Marshall
 Amor. Many camping activities,        
 absailing on sandstone cliffs and a   
 plunge pool for swimming are all on   
 site.                                 </content>
