		<content> North Hykeham Town Councilwith 19     
 councillors has many projects under   
 consideration.Most of the projects    
 depend on money being made available. 
 There is deliberation in council      
 meetings before any money is spent.   
 Fifteen new litter bins are to be put 
 up around the town and new signposts  
 are also being provided. This year    
 twelve thousand pounds has been spent 
 on street lighting.                   
  A new adventure playground is being  
 planned,but of course,safety is a     
 great consideration,meaning long      
 discussion of all aspects. This       
 playground is to be erected on the    
 Witham Fields.                        
  Trees are being planted in the park  
 and footpaths are being signposted.   
  1985 is theYear of the Youth and many
 different events are being organised.
