		<title>19HISTORIC CARLISLE TODAY</title>
		<content>  This block contains many of the      
 features which attract tourists.Car-  
 lisle Museum displays some prehistoric
 remains,and far more from Roman times.
 In its grounds are the main street and
 a shrine of Roman Carlisle.Recent digs
 have revealed more of the extensive   
 Roman city.Hadrian's Wall crossed the 
 block,but is no longer visible.       
  The main historic features are       
 medieval.The castle,where Mary Stuart 
 was once held,is complete,and the     
 cathedral is kept in good condition.A 
 large section of the city wall is     
 standing.                             
  Carlisle has more recent links with  
 Bonnie Prince Charlie;he captured it  
 in 1745.Much has been rebuilt since   
 then.There are some attractive        
 Georgian streets near the             
 cathedral.The crowded housing around  
 the castle was removed in the 1960s.  </content>
