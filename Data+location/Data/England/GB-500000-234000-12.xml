		<content> The Bedpan (Bedford-London St Pancras)
 Line takes on average 750 passengers a
 week from Flitwick. Trains stop every 
 half hour and go to Bedford in 12     
 minutes, Luton in 15 minutes or London
 in 45 minutes. It is likely that the  
 rapid expansion of Flitwick is largely
 due to this fast and efficient service
 as the station master reports that    
 most passengers are commuters or      
 shoppers. A plaque on the  station    
 platform commemorates the opening of  
 the station in 1868. A heightened road
 bridge and lengthened platforms       
 commemorate the completed             
 electrification of the line in 1983.  
 Eastern Counties Bus Company does not 
 try to compete with British Rail so   
 bus services are few and far between, 
 but if the local inhabitants really   
 want to get away from it all Luton    
 Airport is only 15 miles away.        </content>
