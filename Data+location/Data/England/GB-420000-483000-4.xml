		<content> Most people are in employment although
 nationally there is much unemployment.
 Farming and associated industries     
 account for most of the jobs. So there
 are farm_workers,gamekeepers,drivers  
 who deliver feed_stuffs,etc.          
                                       
 There are lots of jobs outside farming
 such as teaching,joinery,building to  
 name just a few.Locally people are    
 employed at the school in a variety of
 work.There is a cook,a non_teaching   
 assistant,a caretaker and a secretary.
                                       
 Quite a few people work at the local  
 Inn.Many are part_time helpers who    
 only come when the pub is busy or has 
 a function. This provides work for    
 some of the house-wives. Other house- 
 wives do work such as cleaning for    
 others and home_help.
