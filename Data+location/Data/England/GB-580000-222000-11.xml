		<content>{*}The interviewee was a 74-year-old   
 widow who has lived in Stisted all her
 life.She has featured in an Anglia    
 T.V.programme about the village and   
 intends to write a local history.She  
 identified three areas of deficiency: 
 public transport,medical services and 
 sheltered housing for the elderly.    
 Apart from the bus service to         
 Braintree on Wednesday and Saturday   
 there was no service to the village.  
 The Colchester/Braintree service by   
 the A120 was the nearest regular route
 but the walk to the main road was too 
 much for the elderly.A community bus  
 was a hoped-for solution.             
{*}No medical services were provided   
 even on a part-time basis.A sheltered 
 housing scheme was needed by the      
 elderly who could not cope in their   
 own homes,but who wanted to stay in   
 the village.                          </content>
