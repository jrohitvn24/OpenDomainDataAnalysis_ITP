 There are three limestone quarries and
 four shafts in the area we surveyed.  
 All of them disused.There are two     
 quarries in Lyme Park.One is just     
 inside West Parkgate and the other is 
 on the edge of the park about a       
 kilometre to the North East.The first 
 is a scenic place with a stream and   
 woodland.The second one is just a pile
 of rubble.The third and last quarry is
 North West of Hilltop Farm and is on  
 farmland.There is some evidence of    
 shafts,such as unnatural bumps and    
 dips in the ground,especially in a    
 flat field.At a particular shaft there
 is a dip in the ground although it is 
 filled in.A hundred metres away the   
 ground has subsided.This is the case  
 at all the shafts.Men are working to  
 clear a slag heap from local coalmines</content>
