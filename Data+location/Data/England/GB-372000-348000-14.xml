		<title>14      BETLEY BONFIRE</title>
		<content> Every year the village hall committee 
organises a bonfire and firework       
display.The bonfire is always on the   
nearest Saturday to November 5th. and  
it  is held on a field of Betley Court 
Farm behind the village hall.          
  The bonfire is so big it burns all   
through the night and is roped off so  
that no one can get too near it.The    
firework display lasts about an hour   
and costs over 2000 pounds.A travelling
fairground comes and there are usually 
my hundreds of people there,so many you
can hardly move around the fair when   
the firework have finished.            
   Many people in the village help to  
build the bonfire and the brownies do  
the cleaning up next day.They often    
find a lot of money which people have  
lost.People come from many miles away, 
all over North Staffordshire and South 
Cheshire.                              </content>
