 Two thirds of this block is in the    
 sea, but the remaining land is of     
 great beauty.  The cliffs are wild and
 of granite covered with much lichen   
 giving a golden colour.  There are    
 about a dozen small fishing boats in  
 the cove at Pemberth and they catch   
 mostly mackerel.  The soil is light   
 granite but in square 3 it is a       
 heavier clay from a moraine.  The     
 National Trust maintains the land in  
 Pemberth Cove.                        
                                       
 Farming away from the cliff ground is 
 intensive - mostly grassland, but the 
 warm winter climate is used to grow   
 vegetables and early spring potatoes. 
 The livestock on the farms is mixed;  
 sheep, dairy herds and some beef but  
 mainly they are milking cows.
