		<content> 93% of households of more than 1      
 person sit down to a family meal at   
 least once a day. Twice a week Meals  
 on Meals are cooked at Dennington     
 Primary school during term time &amp; by  
 voluntary cooks in the holidays.      
 Distribution is by volunteers. Only   
 1 man (aged 97) has Meals on Wheels &amp; 
 he also has a home help. Other        
 recipients live outside the block. 63%
 of households have immediate family   
 living within a 20 mile radius. In    
 Dennington almost as many households  
 have their immediate family living    
 within 20 miles as those who have     
 family in the 20 to l00 mile radius.  
 In Badingham the ratio is 1:1.4. 33%  
 of all households have family outside 
 the radius of 100 miles &amp; 17% of      
 households have family living abroad.
