		<title>10RECENT HAPPENINGS IN BURTON</title>
		<content> Burton Lazars is quite a boring       
 village on the whole,with not alot of 
 things to do in it.There is a church  
 and a village hall and alot of old    
 buildings.Burton Lazars also has some 
 very exciting local history.We used to
 have a big horse racing circuit,this  
 was in the early 20th century,and in  
 1935 it is said that the Grand        
 National was held there.              
   In 1985 the media came to the       
 village and in one of the old houses  
 on East Lane Central Television filmed
 a play about a family with plenty of  
 arguing children.                     
   The supernatural came to the village
 in 1984 when 5 old people and cat all 
 died in the space of one week,one of  
 them at another's funeral.
