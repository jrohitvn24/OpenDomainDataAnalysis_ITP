		<content>  Ascaster Selby is a hamlet on the    
 west bank of the river Ouse.  The     
 majority of dwellings are farms.      
{ There is a postbox and public        
{telephone.  Mobile shops deliver fish 
{weekly and bread twice weekly.  The   
{library van calls fortnightly.  Milk  
{is delivered to only 4 houses as many 
{residents are involved in dairy       
{farming.                              
  Parents of children aged five -      
 eleven must arrange transport to      
 Appleton Roebuck primary school.  An  
 eduction committee bus takes children 
 over eleven to Tadcaster school where 
 the 6th form takes 16-18 year olds.   
{ Religious services are held monthly  
{at St John's Anglican church.         
  There is no public bus service, most 
 people have their own transport and   
 are independent.
