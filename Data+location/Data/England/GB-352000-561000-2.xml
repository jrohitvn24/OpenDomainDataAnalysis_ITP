		<content>  The area surveyed contains a number  
 of interesting places which attract   
 tourists. There is in fact a Tourist  
 Information Office in the Moot Hall in
 the centre of Brampton. The Moot Hall 
 is itself interesting.The present     
 building was erected in 1817 and is   
 octagonal in shape, but there has been
 a Moot Hall on the site since 1648.   
 Outside are stocks and also a bull    
 ring to which a  bull as tied in the  
 days of 'Bull Baiting' was a popular  
 entertainment.                        
  Another building of interest in the  
 town centre is known as Prince        
 Charlie's House. today it is a shoe   
 shop but it was where Bonny Prince    
 Charlie had temporary headquarters    
 during the 1745 Rebellion.
