		<title>04THE HAMLET OF HAWTHORPE</title>
		<content>                                       
 The very small hamlet of Hawthorpe,   
 approximately three miles due west    
 of Kirkby Underwood, consists  of     
 some ten houses mostly built in the   
 local limestone.                      
                                       
 Although the hamlet has very little   
 to offer other than a small post box, 
 there is a good community spirit      
 with  an  annual  New  Year's  Eve    
 gathering  in  one  or  other  of the 
 houses.                               
                                       
 As might be expected, almost all of   
 the working population are involved   
 in farming of one sort or another.    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
