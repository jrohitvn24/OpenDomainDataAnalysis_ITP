		<title>04'Old' Wives Tales ?</title>
		<content>  Old Women's Institute  had an        
 interesting talk on{" Country Cures". 
 Some of the remedies descibed,such as 
{Digitalis (Foxglove)}for heart trouble
 and{Penicillin-type mould}on bread for
 wounds,have the approval of modern    
 scientific thought.                   
  A cure for earache described was to  
 pour hot{Hedgehog Fat }in the ear.    
 This had been tried by a member of    
 the W.I. in their younger days and had
 proved beneficial--for the person but 
 not for the hedgehog !!               
  If ladies take to carrying{Acorns}in 
 their pockets it is because that keeps
 wrinkles at bay,and putting {Pansy    
{leaves}in salads ensures that their   
 menfolk do not suffer from any        
 unseemly lusts.(The origin of the term
{"pansy"}when used in the              
 non-horticultural sense perhaps!)
