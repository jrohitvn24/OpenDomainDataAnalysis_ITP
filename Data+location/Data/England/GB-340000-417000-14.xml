		<title>14Ascroft's Shop Merebrow.</title>
		<content> The shop is situated on the corner of 
 The Gravel and Marshes Lane. We think 
 the shop was first started by Mr.     
 Thomas Ascroft about 1890. Mr. Ascroft
 had 4 children, 2 daughters and 2 sons
 .The daughters Winnie and Daisy would 
 have helped their mother in the shop  
 from the early 1900's.                
   They sold groceries and baked bread,
 pies and cakes. They also sold tobacco
 for which they had to have a licence. 
 Wiinnie, who never married, worked in 
 the shop even after her sister left   
 and got married. Winnie still played  
 an active roll up to the early 1970's.
 She was stone deaf but was a          
 marvellous lip reader. The shop used  
 to deliver groceries to the           
 surrounding area until 1975. Winnie   
 died in January 1976.
