		<title>06ECOLOGY: DANE END &amp; AREA</title>
		<content>{WILD FLOWERS:}There is a large patch  
 of rare{green hellebore}in one of the 
 woods in the area but few people know 
 exactly where it is. Cowslips,        
 primroses and violets grow on the     
 steep banks and verges of the country 
 roads in Springtime. The woods are    
 bright with bluebells and in summer   
 yellow archangels flourish. The monkey
 orchid can sometimes be found. In     
 July, there are enormous patches of   
 scarlet poppies in the fields.        
{MAMMALS:}There is evidence of many    
 common mammals such as badgers, foxes,
 rabbits, hares, mice, rats, grey      
 squirrels, weasels, stoats and moles  
 and several species of deer can be    
 seen grazing on the edge of woodland. 
{BIRDS:}Fieldfare and lapwings can be  
 seen in the fields and kestrels hover 
 searching for prey. Yellowhammers add 
 a splash of gold to the hedgerows.    </content>
