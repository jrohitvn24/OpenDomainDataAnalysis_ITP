 ATTITUDES ARE MIXED WITH PEOPLE LIVING
 IN THE AREA WHO HAVE LIVED THERE FOR  
 YEARS AND WITH THOSE WHO HAVE JUST    
 MOVED INTO THE COUNTRY TO RETIRE OR TO
 BUY PROPERTY WHICH IS LESS EXPENSIVE  
 AS IT IS IN THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY. 
 ALSO AS MORE EXPANSION TAKES PLACE IN 
 THE CITY OF PETERBOROUGH MORE PEOPLE  
 ARE MOVING OUT TO OUR AREA. THE       
 ATTITUDES BEING MIXED ARE MAYBE BEST  
 STATED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE AREA SO   
 HERE I WILL QUOTE SOME OF THE         
 RESIDENTS OWN WORDS ON THEIR ATTITUDES
 TO LIVING IN THIS AREA IN THE 1980's. 
                                       
 MR AND MRS REED THINK LIVING IN THE   
 1980's IN THIS AREA IS 'FANTASTIC'.   
 WHILST MR JUDGE AND HIS WIFE ARE      
 CONCERNED ABOUT THE ECONOMIC AND      
 SOCIAL STATE OF THE COUNTRY.
