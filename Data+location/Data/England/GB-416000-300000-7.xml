		<title>07THE A5 TODAY</title>
		<content>The A5 is one of the main trunk roads  
in the area and carries a considerable 
volume of traffic. At peak times during
the day it becomes particulary         
conjested causing major delays in      
traffic flow. During the summer months 
this problem becomes intensified with  
people travelling to North Wales and   
especially with day trippers to Drayton
Manor Park. Complaints from local      
people concerning problems caused by   
the road include long traffic          
delays,considerable noise and some     
pollution, extreme danger for children 
and old people, and general problems   
for pedestrians who encounter long     
waits in their attempts to cross the   
A5.
