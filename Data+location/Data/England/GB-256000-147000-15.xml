		<title>15Population statistics</title>
		<content>   C M Is popular as a retirement area 
 as can be shown  by the fact that 30% 
 of the population of 2300 are         
 pensioners.  Of the working population
 some 30% are involved with the holiday
 industry. This work is seasonal as    
 most of the gift shops, restaurants   
 and cafes are only open in summer. At 
 the height of the season the          
 population increases threefold.       
   Approximately 25% of those in       
 employment work in the manufacturing  
 industries. These jobs are mostly     
 outside the village at Ilfracombe and 
 Barnstaple.   The unemployment rate is
 about the national average.  There are
 196 children at the CM Primary School 
 and 201 travel to the Comprehensive   
 School in Ilfracombe by bus.  There   
 are approximately 60 pre-schoolage    
 children in the village.
