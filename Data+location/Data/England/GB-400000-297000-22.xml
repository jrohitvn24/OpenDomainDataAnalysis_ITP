the previous article refers to the town art gallery being located above the Central Library (the E M Flint Gallery) - this has now moved and occupies a purpose built building which opened in January 2000 - and has won a variety of architectural awards.  It is located at the top of Park Street, next to the building which has replaced the old cinema (which was present in the last survey) The building cost £21m including £15.75m of National Lottery funding.  It continues to house the town Garman Ryan collection - so of which is priceless.   &lt;br />
