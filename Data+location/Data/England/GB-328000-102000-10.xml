		<title>10PEOPLE:HOME LIFE</title>
		<content> My name is Rachel Spiller,my family   
 and I moved down from Colchester Essex
 in 1982.When my dad left the Army we  
 moved down here as it was his home as 
 a little boy.He now works in          
 Axminster and so does my mum as a     
 teacher.As my dad was in the Army we  
 moved to many places including        
 Germany.We are a family of five living
 in a detatched house in the valley of 
 the Kit just outside the main         
 Chardstock Village,we live in the     
 middle of surrounding countryside and 
 fields.I myself go to the village     
 school and my brother goes to Chard.  
 I usually wake up at round about      
 6.30a.m.At 7.00a.m. I go down to the  
 kitchen and have my breakfast of Rice 
 Crispes and toast.At 8.30a.m.I start  
 off to go to school on my bike.I      
 arrive at school at 8.40a.m. and start
 my day at school.                     </content>
