		<content>    Barley and wheat are the commonest 
 cereals grown in the area plus a      
 little maize.   No oats or rye are    
 grown and few potatoes.   A lot       
 of grass is grown for silage and hay. 
    The price of milk has fallen so    
 much that there are few dairy farms   
 left.   Most farms keep beef animals  
 and sheep are increasing.   There are 
 lots of riding horses.   Small farms  
 tend to be bought up by bigger units. 
    Farmers use contractors as well as 
 their own machinery.   Recent         
 innovations include round bales of hay
 and straw which need no barns for     
 storage.   Silage  is made in large   
 black polythene bags.   Bale handling 
 has become more mechanised with bigger
 machinery which is electronically     
 controled.
