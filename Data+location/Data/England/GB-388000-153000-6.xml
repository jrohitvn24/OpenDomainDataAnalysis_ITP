		<title>06East Town Hamlet</title>
		<content>      1.5km east of West Ashton village
 lies the small hamlet of East Town.   
 The reason for the hamlets existence  
 is obscure, for historically it was   
 sited in the middle of the common     
 field system.It is probably pre 11th.c
 in origin, and the earliest known     
 name for the settlement is{* Saucer's 
{Ashton,}after a family of the same    
 name.                                 
      In its present form the hamlet   
 consists of a cluster of houses round 
 a sharp bend in the road and a farm,  
 with 2 farm workers cottages. The     
 large farmhouse bears the date 1638   
 over the front door.                  
      Life in the small community of 7 
 families centres around the farm. As  
 there are no amenities e.g. shop, pub,
