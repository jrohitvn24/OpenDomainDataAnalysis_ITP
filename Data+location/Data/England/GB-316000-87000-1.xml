		<title>01BRANSCOMBE VILLAGE.</title>
		<content> Most of the houses in Branscombe are  
 100 years old.There are a few farms in
 Branscombe and it is very hilly.I like
 living in Branscombe, it has got lots 
 of paths ,tracks and lanes.The post   
 office is at the bottom of the school 
 lane.It is peaceful and the village   
 people often hold coffee mornings in  
 the village hall. The walks around    
 Branscombe go through woods and       
 fields. The stream that runs down     
 through the valley starts from a      
 spring which rises by Beehive near    
 where I live. I don't know if it comes
 from an under ground stream.Lots of   
 flowers grow on the hills and         
 blackberries grow on the cliff.The    
 beach is pebbly. The houses are spread
 out and the village post office is in 
 the middle of the village.About 100   
 yards down the road from the Church.
