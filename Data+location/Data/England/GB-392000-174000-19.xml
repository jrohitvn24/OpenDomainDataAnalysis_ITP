		<title>19     Life on a Farm</title>
		<content>  Life on a farm is good fun and I     
 often help my Dad. I pick eggs, take  
 the dog for a walk and put straw in   
 the sheds for the cattle. I play hide 
 and seek with my brother in the straw 
 but usually we get told not to.       
  We are starting to make hay now and  
 some farms are starting to cut the    
 straw. I sometimes help my Dad to     
 stack the straw.In the Autumn we      
 plough the fields and plant some      
 crops. In the Winter the fields are   
 sprayed and get ready for the Spring. 
                                       
  We begin the holidays by picking up  
 the hay and straw and maybe doing a   
 bit of silaging and help to feed the  
 cattle. When I help my Dad with the   
 cattle I climb up on top of the straw 
 stack and throw it down on the floor  
 for bedding.
