 Breakfast begins with toast and tea.  
 Many appliances are used including a  
 kettle, toaster and a cooker. To go   
 shopping we use a car which is run on 
 either petrol or diesel. The shops use
 computerised tills to find the total  
 you must pay. In the house a buzzing  
 sound is heard which is made by the   
 telephone. We have already cordless   
 telephones. A television is found in  
 most houses, we have four channels:-  
 BBC1, BBC2, ITV, Channel 4. WHAM! and 
 Paul Young provide pop music among    
 others. In our time few people have   
 visited the moon or outer space. Our  
 schools are  just beginning to use    
 computers. Football, rugby and cricket
 are a few of the games we play at     
 school. We start school at 9am. and   
 finish at 3.30pm.                     </content>
