		<title>01CHARMINSTER PARISH - EAST</title>
		<content>  Charminster Parish is part of the    
 West Dorset area. The village is in   
 rural surroundings. Land to the east, 
 west and north is mainly agricultural,
 with Dorchester, the county town, just
 1\ miles south across the water       
 meadows of the Rivers Frome and Cerne.
  The eastern edge of the parish is    
 formed by the boundaries with         
 Piddlehinton and Puddletown. Further  
 north is the boundary with Cerne      
 Abbas. The area links the Cerne Valley
 to the Piddle Valley - an expanse of  
 gentle hills and wide sweeps of       
 farmland.                             
  The western edge of this area is     
 bordered by the Old Sherborne Road    
 (C12) linking Dorchester with         
 Sherborne. At the eastern edge is the 
 B3143. The only other road (C128) cuts
 east to west through the grounds of   
 Herrison Hospital.                    </content>
