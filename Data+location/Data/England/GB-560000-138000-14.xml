		<title>14Oast Houses and Agriculture</title>
		<content> In this area there is evidence that   
 the traditional oast house is no      
 longer in use for hop drying, but they
 are being converted to dwellings. The 
 hop acerage has declined greatly and  
 the demand for drying facilities      
 decreases. The presence of such       
 residences provides not only evidence 
 of changing agriculture, but also     
 illustrates the impact of residential 
 development on the area. The converted
 oast in Henwood Green Road is         
 completely surrounded by houses not   
 farmland.                             
  In 1878 there were 40,000 acres of   
 hops in Kent, a total of 7000 oasts.  
 Today, in the 12 square kilometre     
 area there are no hops and only 2     
 farms with  oasts not converted, these
 are used only as barns.
