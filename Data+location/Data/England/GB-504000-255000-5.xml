		<title>05Local Water Supply</title>
		<content> Nearby on Sunderland Hill there is a  
 concrete water tower. It can be seen  
 for miles around.Water towers have to 
 be very high so that pure water can be
 piped into our houses under pressure. 
 Ravensden's water supply comes from   
 Grafham Water.It is purified at       
 Bedford Water Works.From there it is  
 pumped to Ravensden water tower.The   
 pumps work continuously to fill the   
 tower.The level of the water in the   
 tower varies at different times in the
 day.During the night demand is low and
 the level of water is high.Between    
 7a.m. and 9a.m. demand is high and the
 water level falls. It falls again in  
 early evening when people return home.
 It is important not to waste water. A 
 dripping tap can waste 20 to 40 litres
 of water daily.Our school bill is Â£201
 for six months.
