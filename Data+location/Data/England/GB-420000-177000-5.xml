		<title>05FARMING - CROPS</title>
		<content> The crops grown in this area are      
 mainly cereals, such as wheat and     
 barley; the majority of which is used 
 as cattle feed.  A small quantity is  
 sold for grinding into flour for bread
 and biscuit making.  A highly         
 intensive cropping system operates.   
 The bulk is winter-sown and then      
 sprayed to kill weeds in the winter or
 early spring.  It is also fertilised  
 with a nitrogen-based chemical in     
 early spring.  The crop is gathered by
 combine harvester in the following    
 August.  This machinery does all the  
 threshing and separating and the grain
 is then dried and sold.               
 During the 1980's more and more land  
 which was once thought to be too steep
 to cultivate is being ploughed and    
 sown for a cereal crop instead of     
 being left as grass for grazing for   
 cattle and sheep.                     </content>
