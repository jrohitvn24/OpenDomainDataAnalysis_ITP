		<content>   The main features of this area are  
 the beautiful hills rising on the west
 to 150m at{Mill Hill Farm}and on the  
 east to 160m at{Mounts Court Farm.}At 
 the bottom of the valley flows the    
{River Nailbourne,}the intermittent    
 stream, that was once much wider than 
 it is now.                            
   The villages of{Elham,}in the north 
 and{Lyminge}in the south, with the    
 hamlet of{Ottinge}between form the    
 main areas of population.             
   There are many buildings of         
 historical and architectural interest 
 in the villages and surrounding area. 
{Elham}in particular has{26 Grade II   
 listed buildings and many of lesser   
 grades.                               
   The grazing of Sheep and Cattle in  
 the valley, with arable farming on the
 hilltops provides the major proportion
 of land use.                          </content>
