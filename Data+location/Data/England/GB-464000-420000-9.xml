		<title>09THE GIANT OF SESSAY .2.</title>
		<content> Sir Guy was a typical knight in       
 shining armour, but had some          
 misgivings about taking the brute on. 
 As Sir Guy and Joan were having dinner
 one evening, the brute appeared making
 for the windmill to steal a sack of   
 grain. Sir Guy dashed out to give     
 battle. Just as the Giant was reaching
 for the sack he was hit on the head by
 one of the sails of the windmill. Sir 
 Guy dispatched the Giant....  married 
 Joan and became the owner of thousands
 of acres of land in the area of       
 Sessay, perhaps providing his         
 descendants with the necessary funds  
 to build a stately home at Cowick.
