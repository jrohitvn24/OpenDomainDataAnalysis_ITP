		<content> As the houses are scattered throughout
 the area and Oswestry town is beyond  
 walking distance for most inhabitants 
 the{family car}is vital. It enables   
 journeys to school and work - so few  
 actually work at home. Only the       
 elderly who dislike driving, and the  
 young who have not reached the age of 
 seventeen to be old enough for a      
 driving licence, seem to be without   
 their own{transport.}Some families    
 have two cars as both husband and wife
 go out to work. Wednesday is{market}  
{day}in nearby Oswestry. On this day   
 the bus service operates between      
 Llansilin and Oswestry. For journeys  
 further afield people travel to       
 Oswestry to catch buses. The nearest  
 railway station is at Gobowen where   
 nine trains run each day to Chester or
 to Shrewsbury. Here connections can be
 made with the rest of the country.    </content>
