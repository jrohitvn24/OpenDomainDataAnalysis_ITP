Much of the land in this area to the   
east of Kinver Edge is used as grazing 
land for sheep at certain times of the 
year. There are some cattle and pigs.  
This grazing helps to prepare the land 
for growing crops at other seasons.    
Some land remains for grazing all year 
round particularly that near the five  
sewage farms in the block.             
                                       
There is some arable farming. Cereal   
crops are grown: mainly spring and     
winter barley. There are also          
vegetables, particularly potatoes.     
Sugar beet is grown and this is        
harvested in late autumn and taken to  
the processing plant in Kidderminster  
about six miles away.                  
                                       
The area contains about ten farms in   
all.                                   </content>
