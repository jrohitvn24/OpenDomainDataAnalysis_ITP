		<title>02HARESFIELD BEACON</title>
		<content>  This area is open grassland owned by 
 the National Trust. Haresfield Beacon 
 has one of the finest views from the  
 South West edge of the Cotswold       
 escarpment. It is a natuaral          
 promontary fortification 700 feet     
 above sea level. There was an early   
 Iron Age settlement on the site and   
 the Romans had a large camp here. In  
 the 19th century, 3000 Roman coins    
 were found here.                      
  To the South East is a topograph, a  
 direction finder from where, on a     
 clear day, it is possible to see      
 across the Severn Vale to the Forest  
 of Dean and even the Brecon Beacons in
 Wales.                                
  Randwick Woods are also owned by the 
 National Trust. To the south of the   
 escarpment, in the woods, is a long   
 barrow which is now covered by trees, 
 mainly larch and copper beech.        </content>
