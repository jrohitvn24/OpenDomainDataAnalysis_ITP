		<title>02A trip around Wimborne Area</title>
		<content> On Monday 10th June 1985, Unit 3 went 
 out in a coach to look at our block   
 and to study the landscape. We went   
 down Middlehill Road to the round-    
 about and on to the new Wimborne      
 by-pass.To the right we saw distant   
 houses and, nearer, the Wimborne      
 Timber Co., and to the left we saw    
 open countryside. Further along the   
 by-pass we crossed the River Stour. We
 then saw the towers of Wimborne       
 Minster in the distance and we could  
 see the front of the old Queen        
 Elizabeth Grammar School. We went     
 across Julian's bridge which is very  
 old. We saw signs to Wimborne market. 
 We went a short distance up the       
 Blandford Road,passing the hospital on
 the left and the cemetery on the      
 right. We turned at the Old Mill and  
 took the Colehill road back to school.
