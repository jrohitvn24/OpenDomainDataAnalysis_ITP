		<title>13MY HOTEL</title>
		<content>  I live in the Biarritz Hotel, St.    
 Brelade's Bay. My dad is the manager  
 and my mum is the manageress. It is   
 fun for me because I meet and make    
 lots of friends there. We have about  
 20 or more staff and I know them all. 
 We have 3 meals a day. At dinner we   
 have 6 courses except on Sunday when  
 we have a buffet supper. We now have  
 an{A-la-carte}menu which you order at 
 lunch. You can also have a Biarritz   
 Brunch instead of the evening meal. In
 the summer holidays I get up early in 
 the morning for breakfast and then go 
 to the keep fit session with the      
 guests. In the afternoon I go down to 
 the beach and sunbathe. Then I come   
 back up and have a bath and get ready 
 for dinner. After dinner I play with  
 my friends or go to help run the      
 evening activities which are organised
 for the guests.                       </content>
