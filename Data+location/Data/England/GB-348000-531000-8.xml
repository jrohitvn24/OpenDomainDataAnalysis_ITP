		<content>  This College runs two farms-a        
 228 hectare lowland farm at Newton    
 Rigg,and Beckside.Both College farms  
 are managed to demonstrate sound      
 commercial practice and provide       
 facilities for student                
 instruction.Established woodland and  
 recently planted areas are a feature  
 of the hill farm.At Newton Rigg       
 accomodation is provided for 120      
 students,with about 50 students       
 living in private lodgings in the     
 neighbourhood of the College.A list of
 approved lodgings is maintained which 
 includes some suitable for married    
 couples.The size of the College means 
 that each student can readily feel    
 part of a community,enabling close    
 working relationships to be developed 
 between students and staff.The major  
 objective of the College is the       
 personal development of the student.  </content>
