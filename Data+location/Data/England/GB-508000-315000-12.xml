 newspaper is the Daily Express. They  
 sell 420 newspapers each day. Six     
 people help with the delivering of    
 papers. One person does each area of  
 village. They deliver the papers in   
 the morning. Other things they sell   
 are sweets, tobaco, stationery, toys, 
 books, gardening things and fancy     
 goods. 700 people go to the shop each 
 day. The shop has a computer till.

 often go there for information and are
 treated kindly. The owners of the     
 newsagents are Mr. and Mrs Coley.
