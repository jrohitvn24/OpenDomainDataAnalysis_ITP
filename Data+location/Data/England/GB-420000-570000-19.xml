		<title>19Brunton Lane</title>
		<content>{Brunton lane}leads from Brunton park  
 estate,the area surrounding Brunton   
 lane is mainly farmland.Therefore most
 of the houses situated here are mainly
 farmhouses.                           
 Just past Brunton park estate some of 
 the farm buildings have been converted
 into{cottages}and have been sold.     
 A lot of the other{farmhouses}have    
 been modernised and there is also a   
 group of very new houses (detached)   
 situated on one farm, which was the   
 Middle Brunton West and east farm.    
        Altogether on Brunton lane     
 there are 2 old farmhouses, 1 large   
 modern farmhouse,5 terraced, 4        
 cottages and 2 detached farmhouses.   
 Most of these were{pre-war}although   
 modernisation had taken place.
