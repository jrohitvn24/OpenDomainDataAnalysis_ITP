		<title>20GARDENS IN TREGONY</title>
		<content>   PROPERTIES OF TREGONY LINING FORE   
STREET HAVE LONG,GARDENS AT RIGHT      
ANGLES TO THE HOUSE AND SOME A PADDOCK.
IN MILL LANE AND TREGONY HILL GARDENS  
ARE SMALLER.                           
  UNTIL THE 1940S THEIR PLOTS WERE     
USED VIEW TO SELF-RELIANCE. CROPS OF   
POTATOES,CABBAGE,ONIONS AND RUNNER     
BEANS WERE PRODUCED.                   
  MOST GARDENS HAD A FEW APPLE         
TREES,CHICKENS AND USUALLY TWO PIGS    
WERE KEPT, ONE FOR SALE, ONE FOR THE   
FAMILY. SOME KEPT A COW.               
  SINCE 1950, A CHANGE IN DOMESTIC LIFE
STYLE HAS REDUCED THE IDEA OF SELF SUF-
FICIENTCY.NO GARDENS ARE NOW FULLY     
CULTIVATED AND LAWNS ARE ANNUALLY CUT, 
GRASS HAS REDUCED VEGETABLE PRODUCTION 
TO LIMITED SIGNIFICANCE.SOME PLOTS ARE 
NEGLECTED OR CONVERTED TO OTHER USES.18
GARDENS HAVE BEEN SUB-DIVIDED AND SOLD 
AS BUILDING PLOTS.(1970)               </content>
