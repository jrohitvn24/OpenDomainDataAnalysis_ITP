		<content>  I am called Antony Tooke.On Thursday 
 I woke up late.I had cornflakes for   
 breakfast,cleaned my teeth and got    
 ready for school.I went to seek       
 Michael.                              
   We went to the hall to practise some
 songs.Then we went into the classroom 
 and did multiplication squares,there  
 were no recorders for boys.           
   After lunch we did Young Geographer 
 and I finished it.I helped Alison     
 transplant my beans and peas.We       
 carefully took the peas out of the    
 tray.We put soil into pots and I put a
 hole in with my finger and put the    
 seedlings into the hole.              
   The teacher read us a story and then
 i went home for tea.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
