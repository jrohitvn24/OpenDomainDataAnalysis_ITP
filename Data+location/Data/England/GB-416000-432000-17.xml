		<content>    In the last  10  years or so,  many
 people of different ethnic origins and
 faiths have come to live in Thornbury.
    In a  class  of  25 children at the
 First School we recorded these beliefs
{Christian  10 (38%),     Hindu 2 (8%),
{Muslim 9 (35%),          Sikh 3 (11%),
{Jehovah's Witness 1 (4%),    Cantonese
{Ancestor Worship 1 (4%).       }Family
 origins were as follows: 5 from India,
 11 Great Britain, 9 Pakistan,  1 South
 China. This reflects the  multi-ethnic
 population of the area.  Here  is what
 come children said:{"I am a Sikh.}I go
 to the  Temple on Friday, Saturday and
 Sunday.  I go with my family. I sit on
 the carpet and I pray to God."        
{"I am a Muslim.}At home we pray to God
 every day.  My aunties come to read in
 my house.  I bring  in  fruit and they
 eat it.  Then I bring a glass of water
 and milk. They drink and pass it on." </content>
