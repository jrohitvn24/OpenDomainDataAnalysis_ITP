		<content> At SILVINGTON village there is a      
 church,It tells you how old it is in  
 black Iron numbers on the             
 door.Silvington church was built in   
 1679.It is 306 yEArs old today.The    
 Vicarage is built right next to the   
 church so the Vicer wouldnt have to   
 travel far.People think that it has a 
 secret passage going to the monastery 
 which is now a house which the        
 Millichamps live in.The church is     
 still in use today,But people say it  
 might fall down in about 3 years.

 numbers,So we had to work it out.
