		<title>18CRAIG'S LEISURE TIME</title>
		<content> As a 12 year old boy, most of my      
 leisure time is either after school or
 at the weekend.On most school days I  
 have about 2\ hours for leisure after 
 school.Some of this time is taken up  
 with{Brass Band}and{piano}practice,and
{Surf Club}(all taking place in Bude). 
    In summer I help a farmer bale his 
 hay and sometimes run shopping errands
 for old people.I also go swimming at{ 
{Summerleaze Beach}and go on cycle     
 rides with my Dad.                    
    In winter I play more on my micro  
 computer with games such as{Bruce Lee,
{Lunar Jet Man,}and Jet Set Willy.If it
 snows, I use my sledge down the hill  
 near my home, but this is not very    
 often because winters are mild.I tend 
 to watch much{television}but also play
 board games such as{Monopoly and      
{Cluedo}with my older brother and      
 relations.                            </content>
