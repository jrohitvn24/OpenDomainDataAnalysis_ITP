		<title>13HANNINGTON T.V. MAST</title>
		<content>  The most prominent feature of this   
 area is the mast on{Cottington Hill   
 near{Hannington.}It is run by the     
 BBC, but is also used by ITV.         
  The mast is 500 feet tall, and a man 
 called a rigger has to climb it and   
 check that everything is in order, and
 to replace the warning lights. There  
 are fifteen lights, three on each     
 stage.                                
  Below the mast are some buildings    
 used by the{Home Office,}who own the  
 site. They fit and repair the radios  
 used by the police, fire and ambulance
 services. There are twenty-six people 
 working there. Other buildings belong 
 to the BBC, and are used for all the  
 technical work on the mast and for    
 transmitting television pictures.     
 Aerials collect signals and pass them 
 to other masts in the area.
