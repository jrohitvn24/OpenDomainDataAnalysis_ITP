 a backactor.The gravel is dug from    
 pits about 6m deep.Many of the empty  
 hollows are now filled with water.They
 dig out 200 000 tons in 3 months which
 is about 1 600 tons a day.The gravel  
 is loaded onto lorries owned by the   
 buyer.There are 6 people employed at  
 the quarry.                           
  When a pit is finished they push back
 the waste material and the land is    
 levelled out.The top soil is replaced 
 and the land is turned into grazing   
 for cows.It can never be used for     
 building.                             
  Some of the gravel produced here is  
 used on the estate for reinforcing    
 tracks and drains.The rest is sold to 
 a main buyer who uses it for road     
 working and foundations of buildings.
