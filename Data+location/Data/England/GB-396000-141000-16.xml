		<title>16LOCAL HISTORY, CHITTERNE</title>
		<content> The Wallis family has farmed at "The  
 Manor", Chitterne for over 2OO years. 
 A horse chestnut tree was planted on  
 the village green to commemerate Queen
 Victoria's Jubilee in 1887 and is     
 still there. Other trees were planted 
 in 1953 to celebrate the coronation of
 Queen Elizabeth II.  St. Mary's Church
 fell into disrepair and was pulled    
 down, leaving only the Chancel. The   
 tiles in the Chancel of All Saint's   
 Church, which was completed in 1862,  
 are from St. Mary's, and so are some  
 of the furnishings. Mr. Collins of    
 Manor Farm, Codford, has a collection 
 of old farm tools and equipment, open 
 to the public on request. Quebec Farm 
 was named after the Battle for Quebec 
 in 1759, and built in that year,      
 although ther original buildings no   
 longer stand.
