		<content>    In our area there is more          
{industrial}than agricultural work     
 available, though it used to be the   
 reverse. The south-eastern part of    
 the area has the most concentrated    
 employment.                           
    The main employers are Hestair     
 Dennis, the Borough Council, and shops
 and offices. More women than men have 
 part-time jobs.                       
    We surveyed a sample of 108 school 
 families with these results:          
 Of the{fathers}43.5% are manual       
 workers, 39.8% professional people and
 11.1% work in service jobs. 4.6% are  
 self-employed and 1% are unemployed.  
 The largest groups of manual and      
 non-manual workers were engineers     
 18.5%, and managers/directors 21.3%.  
 Of the{mothers,}74% do not have a job,
 while 26% have, with office workers   
 being the largest group at 13.6%.     </content>
