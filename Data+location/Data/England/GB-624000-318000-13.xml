		<title>13A DAY IN ROBERT'S LIFE</title>
		<content> At half past seven in the morning I   
 wake up and get washed. I go in my    
 room and make my bed then I get       
 dressed. When I am dressed I go       
 downstairs and have breakfast. Then I 
 go and watch TV for a little while. I 
 go to North Walsham rugby club to     
 train. In the training we do pressups,
 throwing the ball, tackling and then  
 we have a game. At twelve my dad      
 collects me and we go home for lunch. 
 Usually we have a roast and a sweet   
 for afters. Then I might do some      
 gardening. I wish I'd never offered.  
 I'll do some weeding and watering for 
 mum then I'll watch dad doing some.   
 Then it's tea time. I'll perhaps have 
 a salad then go and watch TV. It will 
 be the 'A' Team or the Late Late      
 Breakfast Show. Then I will go to bed 
 and think of the things I will do     
 tomorrow.                             </content>
