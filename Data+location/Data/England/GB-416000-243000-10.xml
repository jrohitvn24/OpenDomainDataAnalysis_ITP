		<title>10The Carnival  Mickleton</title>
		<content> The carnival was in the Senior Playing
 Field.My mother was on a float with   
 the Mickleton Playgroup.There were    
 four more floats by Threeways,the Cubs
 the Scouts,and the Brownies who won   
 the competition with 'The Magic Round-
 about'.There were lots of stalls,my   
 favourite was archery.It was 15 pence 
 for three arrows.I had 6 arrows and   
 hit the target twice.There was a bar  
 inside the pavilion.There were cakes, 
 drinks,ice lollies and ice creams.    
 There were pony rides,and a man with a
 red-tailed hawk.He said that normally 
 it would catch its own prey which are 
 rabbits and voles.A stall that was    
 very popular was a stall where you    
 threw darts at little bags fixed on a 
 board,some with money in.The most you 
 could win was Â£1.I won two pence.There
 was bowling at nine skittles which you
 tried to knock down with three balls. </content>
