		<content>    Our area consists of these places:-
 Heath End,Upper Hale, Hale,           
 Weybourne,Badshot Lea,Runfold,        
 N.E.Farnham and S.E.Aldershot.        
    Most of this area is residential   
 and as both Farnham and Aldershot     
 railway stations are on the main line 
 to London many people commute from    
 here every day.                       
    The area contains Rowhill Copse an 
 area of ancient woodland and parts of 
 two large parklands. Farnham Park and 
 Aldershot Park pleasantly divide the  
 residential areas.                    
    The area around Runfold in the     
 south east of the block is mainly     
 farmland. There are also two small    
 industrial estates.One is in the      
 Aldershot area and the other is       
 between Badshot Lea and Farnham.
