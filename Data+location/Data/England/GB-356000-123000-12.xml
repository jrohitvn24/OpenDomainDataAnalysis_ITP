		<title>12THE SCHOOL IN QUEEN CAMEL</title>
		<content>  Countess Gytha Primary school in     
 Queen Camel serves an area of about 16
 square miles.                         
  School starts at 9.10 am and finishes
 at 3.30 pm. There is a lunch break    
 from 12.00 to 1.15 when the majority  
 of children eat packed lunches,       
 although school meals are available.  
 Mid-morning milk is also provided at  
 8p a day. At the end of the day most  
 children travel home on contract      
 buses. These are free to any infants  
 living further than 2 miles from the  
 school and to juniors further than 3  
 miles.                                
  The oldest school building dates back
 to 1872. The school has a heated      
 outdoor swimming pool which each class
 uses daily.                           
  The school has a friendly family-like
 atmosphere. The staff are popular but 
 strict.                               </content>
