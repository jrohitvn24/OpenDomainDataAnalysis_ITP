		<content> Farms predominate in this area worked 
 for generations by single close       
 families, tenants of two owners. A    
 pastoral scene with Bodmin Moor to the
 west and in the south, Dartmoor. Daily
 life follows a strict pattern. The    
 majority of farmers have two vehicles 
 and average size families. Inner-city 
 people are buying old properties in an
 effort to improve the quality of their
 lives. Village schools have smaller   
 registers, supported by out county    
 families. We are six miles from       
 Launceston, ancient capital of        
 Cornwall, and served only by narrow   
 lanes. Public bus, limited to one a   
 week on market day. North sea gas is  
 supplied and connected by request.    
 Connection is costly. The B3254 on the
 eastern side of the block carries     
 heavy transport and public bus        
 services.                             </content>
