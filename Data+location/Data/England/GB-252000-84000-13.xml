		<title>13Some Flowers of Dartmoor</title>
		<content>   It is a fallacy to suggest Dartmoor 
 is a barren sheep clipped place. On   
 the contrary there are several flowers
 that enliven the rocky landscape.     
   Nestling close to the ground is the 
 yellow of the Tormentil. This flower  
 was used as a medicine by the moormen,
 being especially good for stomach     
 upsets.                               
   The tiny clumps of white flowers of 
 the Heath Bedstraw again were useful  
 to the tinners and others that had to 
 live on the moor. These were used to  
 stuff the matresses, and when the     
 sleeper turned over a pleasant smell  
 resulted. Probably just as well, since
 the tinners huts must have been rather
 smelly.                               
   Finally, in the spring nestling     
 beneath the rocks, one can see the    
 blue of the violet. It hides away, but
 can be found if searched for.         </content>
