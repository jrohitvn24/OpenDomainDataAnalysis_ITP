		<title>05THE CHURCH W.WORLINGTON</title>
		<content> West Worlington church is called St.  
 Marys like East Worlington church. It 
 dates back to the thirteenth century. 
 It has a twisted spire with wooden    
 shingles.The spire has been restored  
 since it was struck by lightning      
 in 1976.The family of Sir Hugh Stucley
 who live at Affeton Castle have been  
 associated with the church for many   
 hundreds of years.The rectory known as
 Glebe House was sold in 1919 when East
 and West livings were joined.The      
 rector now is Mr.Hudson who lives at  
 Witheridge and is in charge of 6      
 churches.Family service is held every 
 third Sunday in the month and choir   
 practice three Fridays in the month.  
 We have a family Christmas service in 
 West church and the school takes part 
 along with other groups in the        
 community.
