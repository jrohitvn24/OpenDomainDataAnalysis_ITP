		<title>07Recreation in Great Brickhil</title>
		<content> In Great Brickhill there is a cricket 
 team which playsin the village and    
 consists mainly of local players. At  
 one end of the cricket field there    
 is a cricket clubhouse. Behind the    
 club is a tennis court and there is a 
 village tennis team. The court has    
 just had a new hard core surface which
 makes it a lot faster. There is       
 another tennis court in Brickhill but 
 it is owned by Sir Philip Duncombe and
 is private. At the Duncombe Arms Pub  
 there is a twelve hole putting course 
 you hire balls and clubs from the pub.
 There is also a boules pit which is a 
 french game where you throw a ball in 
 a sand pit. The winner is the one who 
 throws their ball nearest to the white
 ball called a jack. There is a        
 Brickhill Junior football team        
 which is also based at the cricket    
 club.                                 </content>
