		<content> Jimmy and the Stone Snatchers.        
 You need 14 stones. Lay them on the   
 ground. 10 people as the stone        
 snatchers and 1 is Jimmy. When the    
 snatchers pick up the stones, Jimmy   
 has to tig them. You have to take one 
 at a time and you are not supposed to 
 argue over the stones. I play with    
 Sarah, Becky and Craig.               
 My favorite game is hide and seek.    
 Some one counts and 5 people hide. The
 person who is on counts to 100 in     
 ones, then when the person has counted
 she/he says come ready or not. By then
 you should of hidden. If you don't get
 your dobbie first you are on. 6 people
 can play hide and seek. I play with   
 Julie Partener.                       
 My favorite game is Tig.              
 What you have to do is someone has to 
 count to 10, then they come to catch  
 us.                                   </content>
