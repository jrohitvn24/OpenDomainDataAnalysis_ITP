		<content>  When people visit Corsham they either
 stay in the Methuen Arms Hotel or the 
 Stagecoach Motel.The Methuen Arms     
 Hotel has a restaurant and 24 rooms.  
 The Stagecoach Motel has 21 rooms. It 
 has lots of facilities including a    
 swimming pool.People stay in Corsham  
 because it is quiet and close to      
 places like Bath,Lacock and Castle    
 Combe.The two main tourist attractions
 are St.Batholomew's Church and Corsham
 Court. Corsham Court is owned by the  
 Methuen family. It was rebuilt after a
 fire in 1582.The gallery contains     
 thousands of pictures including one by
 Van Dyck.The gardens are very large   
 and beautiful. St Bartholomew's Church
 is also very beautiful. Tourists might
 be attracted by the Methuen Chapel or 
 the grave of Sarah Jarvis,who cut her 
 second set of teeth shortly before she
 died at the age of 103.               </content>
