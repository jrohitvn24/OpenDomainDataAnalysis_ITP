		<content> PHOTOGRAPH C shows the gable end of   
 what is left of this building, top of 
 Fox Road, opposite "Racehorse" PH.    
 Recently converted to sheep sheds and 
 now used for general storage.  Origin 
 -ally built in 1940 as a hostel for   
 Land Army girls, it was used to house 
 first Italian Prisoners of War, then  
 displaced persons, eg Latvians, who   
 were employed by local farmers.  One  
 or two married local girls.  On the   
 death of one of the occupants in the  
 early 1980s (buried at Catworth) the  
 two remaining were rehoused locally,  
 and parts of the structure demolished.
                                       
 The hostel was supplied with water and
 electricity earlier than most of the  
 rest of the village, also first sewage
 disposal works. One guard, now retired
 lives in Catworth (married local girl)
