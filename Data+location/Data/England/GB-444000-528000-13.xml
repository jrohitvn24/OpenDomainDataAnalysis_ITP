		<content> Many people use Brierton Quarry as a  
 place for riding motor cycles or BMX  
 bikes.There are jumps,banks and       
 sandpits which provide great          
 enjoyment. Unfortunately the quarry is
 being spoiled by the dumping of       
 rubbish.                              
 Last year a meeting was organised     
 there by the Cleveland Motorcycle     
 Club. Bricks and blocks of wood were  
 laid down for manouvering and         
 balancing tests. Each race included   
 about twenty such tests.              
 Youngsters ride BMX bikes in the      
 quarry. It is good for these bikes    
 because  the jumps are smooth and the 
 riders can go over very easily. Makes 
 of BMX bikes found there include      
 Mongoose, Wildcat and Burner.
