		<title>15RECREATION</title>
		<content> Recreation in the villages of Sheepy  
 Magna and Sibson is self made. Cricket
 and football matches, and social      
 events organised by the various       
 village clubs are held in the village 
 hall or school. Events include fetes, 
 dances,musical entertainment and whist
 drives. The lack of recreation        
 facilities possibly effects the       
 teenagers of the villages most,       
 although they do participate in the   
 general village events and parents    
 provide transport whenever needed. The
 villages are served by a mobile       
 library and chiropodist but for       
 further health services residents must
 travel outside the area to Atherstone 
 or Market Bosworth. For shopping and  
 more sophisticated entertainments the 
 larger towns and cities of the        
 Midlands are within easy reach of the 
 area.                                 </content>
