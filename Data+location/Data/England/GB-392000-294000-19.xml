		<title>19Area Transport</title>
		<content>The area has many means of transport.  
You can travel to many places by bus   
from nearby Wolverhampton and Bilston  
itself. The area is served by West     
Midlands Passenger Transport. There are
complaints about buses being dirty.    
Railway transport from Wolverhampton is
best and trains run mostly on time. The
station is a new one and improvements  
are still being made with a new car    
park nearby. The Canals run through the
area though they are little used today.
Some people pass through on pleasure   
boats. The areas roads, particularly   
off the Main roads, often need repair. 
For car drivers the M5 is quite close  
and a link road is being built from the
Birmingham New Road. Some people wait  
for this road to help them miss a lot  
of urban traffic while others think    
that the Birmingham New Road is already
too busy and the Link will worsen it.  </content>
