		<title>19Housing in Maylands</title>
		<content> Housing in Maylandsea was nearly all  
 wooden chalet weekend accommodation or
 caravan plots. These have now nearly  
 all changed to{permanent brick and    
{tile residences}with the majority     
 detached and of an executive type.    
 There are also a fair proportion of   
 bungalows. The houses have been built 
 by smaller building companies and self
 build groups.{The latest properties   
 are timber framed of Scandinavian     
 design with brick exterior.           
 In Mayland the{Mid Essex housing      
 association in conjunction with The   
 Housing Corporation are building 40   
 flats for the{elderly with resident   
 warden and communal facilities. The   
 only council housing in the whole area
 is 6 cottages in Mayland.
