		<title>11      FRIDAY MARKET</title>
		<content>    In 1202 King John gave a charter   
 granting a fair at Long Sutton each   
 Friday. 50 years later in 1252, Henry 
 III gave a charter, this time granting
 a market at Long Sutton each Thursday.
 The market is on Thursday when Friday 
 is a Bank Holiday. Later, on Friday,  
 September 26th, 1823 a free market was
 proclaimed in the Market Place. 10,000
 people gathered to watch the opening.

 carried out, noted these stalls.
