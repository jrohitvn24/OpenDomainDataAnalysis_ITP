		<content>At 2.00pm on 19th June the return  of  
Queen Elizabeth 1 to Knole House was   
celebrated. The Queen entered through  
the outer courtyard, into the inner    
courtyard. The household then knelt    
 in front of her. All the drums were   
being played very loudly, then the     
actors started their play. The story   
started with the Stricken Wood where a 
brave knight saved it from the merry   
maidens,this was for the Queen's       
entertainment. When the Queen laughed  
everybody else had to laugh, when she  
was angry everybody had to kneel. When 
the wind was mentioned we had to make a
noise like the wind and when the       
Stricken Wood was mentioned we had to  
make a groan and curl up. After the    
story the Queen got angry and started  
to go back home.She came back but she  
 had business to deal with. We enjoyed 
 it very much.                         </content>
