		<title>06Roadside flowers,Marchwood.</title>
		<content> The main road through the area is     
 the Marchwood By-Pass which runs from 
 Fawley to Totton and the M27.There is 
 lots of heavy traffic including oil   
 tankers from the refinery.Grass verges
 line the road and{many wild flowers   
 have grown.In early July in a 50 metre
 stretch{we found 37 different         
 species.Only a few centimetres from   
 the road smaller plants grow close to 
 the ground such as pineapple weed,    
 shepherd's purse and scarlet          
 pimpernel.Further away from the road  
 were purple and white clover followed 
 by chickweed and dandelion.Pink herb  
 robert and clumps of white cow        
 parsley were interspersed with giant  
 ox-eye daisies.Tufted vetches entwined
 between them in a mass of blue.Few    
 motorists notice this lovely 'garden' 
 as they speed on their way.
