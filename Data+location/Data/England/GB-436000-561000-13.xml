		<content> The swimming pool was opened on 21st  
 October 1977. The pool is always      
 lovely and warm and has a wave machine
 and a super long slide nicknamed{The  
{AquaBlaster}.All the family have a    
 good time because it has a shallow    
 area like a beach getting gradually   
 deeper to nearly 2 metres. There is a 
 separate diving pool with a           
 springboard and you can see the divers
 under the water by looking through a  
 huge glass window on the poolside.    
 Children from my school go to the     
 Leisure Centre once every two weeks   
 for our swimming lesson in a special  
 learner pool next to the main one. In 
 1985 South Tyneside Council announced 
 future plans for the land adjoining   
 the pool, which includes a nature     
 consevation area,providing            
 horse-riding facilities and an        
 informal woodland area.               </content>
