       As there are not many people in 
 our block and there are no main roads,
 the wildlife is very undisturbed.     
 There are various copses where deer   
 can hide. There are also lots of      
 badgers and rabbits. At Kittisford    
 there are also a large number of      
 toads.Bats are frequently seen at the 
 end of the day.                       
       A Greater Spotted Woodpecker,   
 Heron and Kingfishers have all been   
 seen recently and almost every day we 
 see Buzzards and Hawks.               
       In the hedgerows this year we   
 have found primroses, violets,  early 
 purple orchids,stonecrop, scabious,   
 honeysuckle,foxgloves, speedwell, self
 heal, woody nightshade,periwinkle,    
 mallow,rosebay willowherb, herb
