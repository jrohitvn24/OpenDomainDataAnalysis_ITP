		<content>    We learned the alphabet and        
 multiplication tables by rote. We had 
 handwriting lessons,using slates and  
 slate pencils. I remember one day when
 all the class got 2 strokes of the    
 cane because no-one would own up to   
 breaking a box of slate pencils. I    
 felt particularly aggrieved as it     
 was my birthday!                      
   We always wore white pinafores with 
 frills on the shoulders,over our      
 dresses, with handkerchiefs pinned to 
 the front.On our feet we wore boots.  
   I can remember giving a concert on  
 the rectory lawn for bombed soldiers  
 who were convalescing at Swillington  
 House. It was a lovely day-looking    
 back all the days  seemed to be sunny.
   Before I left school,at the age of  
 13, council houses had been built in  
 the village,and many folk came from   
 the N.E.to work in the pits.          </content>
