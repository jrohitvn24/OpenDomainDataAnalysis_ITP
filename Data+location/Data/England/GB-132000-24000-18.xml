		<title>18A Day In My Life</title>
		<content> I think that a Tuesday is my favourite
 day so I am going to write about the  
 normal things I do on Tuesday. I get  
 up at quarter to eight. I get dressed,
 have my breakfast and go to school at 
 quarter to nine. I start school with  
 assembly, in assembly Mr Cooper tells 
 us the events which are going to      
 happen in the next fortnight. I have  
 one lesson then our morning breaktime.
 After that I have two more lessons and
 lunch followed by a break. We have    
 three more lessons then its home time 
 for most people but I stay for chess  
 club which I enjoy very much. I come  
 home and have a small snack. Next     
 comes the best part of the day _ one  
 hour of cricket club. I practise      
 batting and bowling against other     
 boys. I come home and have my dinner.I
 watch television for a while and then 
 go to bed.                            </content>
