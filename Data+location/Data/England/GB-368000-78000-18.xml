		<title>18By train down to the Quay.</title>
		<content>  The {train}takes passengers from     
{Weymouth Station}to the{Ferry Terminal
 on the{Quay side.}When the train goes 
{through Weymouth}it can cause a big   
 traffic jam, especially if the train  
 is a long one because it blocks       
 several main traffic routes.The train 
 leaves the station, past the fair,    
 along{Commercial Road down to the Quay
{side.}Infront of the Train is a       
{police car.}Behind the police car,    
 infront of the train are{two men in   
{florescent jackets who carry red      
{flags.}Sometimes when the train comes 
 through some cars are parked in the   
 way so the police and men have to move
 them by force. This can cause the     
 train to be late by the Quay side.Most
 visitors think it is funny that the   
 train goes through a busy part of     
 Weymouth,{usually twice a day}to link 
 with the ferry. -Pam Whitmarsh.       </content>
