		<title>10THE DEVIL IN DANBURY</title>
		<content> One of the first legends that was told
 in Danbury was when a terrible storm  
 destroyed the timber spire on the 24th
 of May 1402.The storm occurred during 
 Evensong and the devil appeared in the
 church at that time.                  
         THE DEVIL AND THE BELL        
 One dark night a devil roamed Danbury 
 when he found the chantry.The devil   
 knocked on the door and a monk opened 
 it.The devil said, "Can I come in?"The
 monk refused.The devil walked to the  
 church.He peered up and saw the bell  
 tower and the six bells.He climbed the
 bell tower and seized a bell and took 
 it outside.He placed the jewels that  
 he had stolen in the bell.Then he     
 walked down the hill.Gradually the    
 bell became too heavy so it was left  
 on the site of The Bell pub.This could
 explain the pub's name and also why   
 the church has five bells and not six.</content>
