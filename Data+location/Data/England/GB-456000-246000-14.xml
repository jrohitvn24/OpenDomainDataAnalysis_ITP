		<content>{LOIS WEEDON SCHOOL}is church assisted 
 with 18 pupils at present, 5-11 years.
 Built in 1846, together with a head-  
 master's house &amp; later extended to    
 cater for 75 pupils.  It has one full 
 time &amp; one part time teacher.         
 Although very small it is popular with
 &amp; part of the local community.  Very  
 young children do not have to catch a 
 bus to school.  The children benefit  
 from individual attention, teachers   
 knowing them &amp; their families.  The   
 shy child, bully or pupil with        
 difficulties does not go unnoticed.   
 However children have fewer personal  
 contacts &amp; may miss out on team games,
 though link-ups may be made with other
 small schools.  Less equipment is     
 available; it has a computer but has  
 to make do with outside toilets.      
 At 11 students then have to travel to 
 the local Comprehensive Schools.      </content>
