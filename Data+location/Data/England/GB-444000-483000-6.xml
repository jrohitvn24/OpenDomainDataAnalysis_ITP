		<title>06ST FELIX CHURCH, FELIXKIRK</title>
		<content>  A house study group meets in the     
 village weekly.                       
  Campanology is practised by an       
 enthusaistic group of ringers. Ramps  
 have been installed to enable easy    
 access to the church by the disabled. 
 Maintainance of the church is         
 partially solved by the use of sheep  
 and goats grazing there to keep the   
 grass down.                           
  Every possibility of missionary work,
 taking the church out to the people to
 become part of society as a whole, is 
 siezed eagerly by committed           
 worshippers.                          
  Recently the church was redecorated  
 through the Manpower Services Scheme. 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
