		<title>16Ubley Trout Hatchery</title>
		<content> The greatest claim to fame in the area
 is probably the Trout Hatchery at     
 Ubley at the eastern end of Blagdon   
 Lake which exports ova all over the   
 world. Trout bred there are now       
 swimming in the rivers of countries as
 far apart as Kenya, South Africa, New 
 Zealand and the Far East.             
   The spawning season for brown trout 
 begins in late October: rainbow trout 
 spawn later, usually from February to 
 April. The fish are caught in an auto-
 matic fish trap, placed in concrete-  
 lined ponds, and eggs stripped from   
 them and fertilised. They are then    
 taken to the hatchery house where they
 are placed in specially designed woven
 baskets immersed in shallow troughs   
 through which a continuous stream of  
 water flows. The fry are artificially 
 fed, they are 9 months old when they  
 are used to restock the local lakes.  </content>
