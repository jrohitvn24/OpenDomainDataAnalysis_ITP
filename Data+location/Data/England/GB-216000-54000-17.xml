		<title>17WAR EMERGENCY COMMITTEE-1985</title>
		<content>  The War Emergency Committee is a sub 
 committee of the Parish Council.It is 
 responsible through the District      
 Council to the County Council for the 
 survival,recovery and maintenance of  
 community life in the parish after an 
 attack by nuclear weapons.Decreed by  
 the Government it is obligatory that  
 County Councils prepare{Home Defence  
 plans and the organisation to put     
 these plans into effect in wartime.   
 The aim of the committee is to help   
 the community survive and continue.Any
 nuclear attack,with radio active      
 fall-out would result in enormous     
 damage and casualties.It is possible  
 that the survival rate could be as    
 high as 80% in some rural areas,such  
 as ours.
