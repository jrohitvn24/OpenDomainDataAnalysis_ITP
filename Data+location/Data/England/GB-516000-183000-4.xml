   I asked the class how many people   
 in their family worked and there were 
 quite a lot of people working.When I  
 added up the total it came up to 44   
 people working.                       
                                       
     Then I asked them how many worked 
 out of Wembley. Some worked in places 
 like Wimbledon,Harrow, Kingsbury,     
 Central London,etc.I added up the     
 total and it came up to 27 out of 44  
 people,that means that about 60% of   
 people work out of this area. Most of 
 them worked in {Central London.       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
