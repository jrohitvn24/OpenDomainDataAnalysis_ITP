		<title>02 Beccles Common</title>
		<content>  The Common used to belong to the     
Abbey of Bury St Edmunds.In 1540 Henry 
VIII granted Beccles Fen to William    
Rede and the people of Beccles for the 
payment of $126.A charter by Queen     
Elizabeth I in 1584 gave the 140 acres 
to be administered by a Port Reeve and 
a common council of 36 members.        
  It is still a beautiful area covered 
with trees and bushes and surrounded   
by fencing.To enter the area you must  
cross a cattle grid which keeps in the 
8 cows allowed to graze.               
  In the war it was used as a training 
ground by the Home Guard and there is  
still an old pill box used by children 
to play on. There is a 9 hole golf     
course and a very small clubhouse.     
  Many people use the common to walk   
their dogs and children play on the    
adventure playground.
