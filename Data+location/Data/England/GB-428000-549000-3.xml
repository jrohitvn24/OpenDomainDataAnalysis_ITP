		<content>{LILY LUMLEY -  (14th century)} was   a
 Protestant. Secretly, priests tried to
 return her to the  Catholic  religion.
 She refused.The priests killed her and
 flung her  body  down a  well.  Lily's
 ghost has supposedly been seen  rising
 from that  same well in Lumley Castle.
{ANNE WALKER -(17th cent), }housekeeper
 for a male relative, was thought to be
 pregnant and  banished  from his  home
 escorted by Mark Sharp, a collier, and
 her employer, Walker. She disappeared.
 Sometime later, her bloodstained ghost
 appeared  to a  local  miller.  She   
 informed him  Sharp had  attacked  her
 and  flung  her  body  down a  disused
 shaft.Eventually the  terrified miller
 told a magistrate.  A search  revealed
 her body and other evidence  which led
 to  the  conviction of  both  men.  A 
 child's ghost  was  seen  on  Walker's
 shoulders during the trial.{ A.Robson.</content>
