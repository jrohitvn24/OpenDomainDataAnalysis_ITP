		<content> Most of the industries are quite      
 successful for what they do.The firms 
 range from working with diamonds to   
 making fizzy drinks.Kress Power Tools 
 is the newest factory on this         
 industrial estate and R.Whites Soft   
 Drinks is the oldest.The average age  
 of the businesses is 52 years and 4   
 months.There are not many industries  
 on the estate compared with other     
 parts of Coventry.                    
 Half of the workers come to work by   
 car and the average amount of time it 
 takes them to get to work is 21       
 minutes.Some of the factories need    
 more space to work in for what they   
 do,for example Britra Finish who need 
 twice as much space.All the businesses
 have enough emergency equipment,for   
 example fire extinguishes and first   
 aid kits.The employees were content   
 with their wage levels.               </content>
