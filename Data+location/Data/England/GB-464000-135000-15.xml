		<title>15St.Andrew's Church Medstead</title>
		<content>        The church at Medstead was     
 mentioned in the Domesday Book in     
 1086, which shows that part of it is  
 Norman or earlier. It was enlarged in 
 1160, and further alterations were    
 carried out in 1561 and 1645.         
                                       
        In 1845 the narrow Norman      
 archway between the Nave and the      
 Chancel was replaced with the current 
 pointed one. Between 1851 and 1861 the
 West tower was demolished. The South  
 Door was added because the low North  
 Door knocked the top hats off yeoman  
 farmers as they entered the church.   
                                       
        The oldest part of the church  
 now existing is the North Arcade of   
 the Nave, built in 1160.
