		<title>10THE PINETUM,HIGHNAM WOODS</title>
		<content>  The Highnam Pinetum was begun in 1844
 by Thomas Gambier-Parry,at the age of 
 28.The chosen site faces south and    
 light sandy soils provide good        
 drainage and clay patches adding      
 variety.By 1845 some 385 species were 
 planted.The Pinetum and landscaped    
 garden were also noted for wild       
 flowers.                              
  Pinetum Lodge,once the gamekeeper's  
 home is now occupied by Mr.J.D.Wilkin 
 who has begun the task of restoring   
 this neglected attraction.An MSC      
 community programme has undertaken    
 clearing fallen timber,rebuilding     
 paths and bridges and most importantly
 replanting amongst the mature trees to
 restore the 13 acres to its former    
 glory.The public approach is by       
 footpath from Two-mile lane at G.R.   
 79101966.
