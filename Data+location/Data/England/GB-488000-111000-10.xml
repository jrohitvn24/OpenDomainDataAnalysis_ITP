		<title>10East Dean's Local History</title>
		<content> All Saints church in East Dean dates  
 from 1150 A.D. and is in the shape of 
 a cross,inpressive in its simplicity, 
 it has plain windows and little       
 ornamentation                         
 Some Bronze age round Barrows have    
 been found in the area.               
 Fox Hall, Charlton, with its tall     
 chimneys, royal bedroom with fine     
 panelling and great fireplace was     
 built in 1730 by the Duke of Richmond 
 as a hunting lodge in connection with 
 the famous Charlton Hunt.             
 Goodwood Racecourse has existed for   
 nearly 200 years.                     
 In the Middle ages East Dean Park was 
 a deer park of the Earls of Arundel   
 but few traces still remain. The two  
 lodges at Pilley Green are now used as
 private houses.                       
 To the north east and south west of   
 Pilley Green are Tumulus sites.       </content>
