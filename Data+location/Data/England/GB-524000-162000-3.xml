		<content> Belmont village gets quite congested  
 as people shop or use it as a cut     
 through from the by-pass to the       
 Brighton Road.  The Sutton by-pass is 
 very busy and dangerous.  The by-pass 
 can be very inconvenient for people   
 who live near it because it is so     
 noisy at night.                       
   Our school,The Avenue, is affected  
 by the noise and pollution. It would  
 be nice if we had a subway or bridge  
 over it because it is a devil to      
 cross. Safety is a main concern.      
 Luckily a policeman helps us cross    
 over before and after school, when the
 road is especially busy.              
   Few children's dads actually work in
 the village, although some work nearby
 in Croydon, Sutton and Banstead.  Many
 local people commute to London each   
 day by train or car.
