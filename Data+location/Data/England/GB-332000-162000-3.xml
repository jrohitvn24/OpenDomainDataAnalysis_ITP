		<content> The Bristol Channel ( or Severn       
 Estuary) has the second highest rise  
 and fall of tide in the world.There is
 a lot of wildlife here such as birds, 
 tiny creatures,fish and mammals,but   
 you would not think it.The sea is a   
 dirty brown colour but it is only the 
 mud washed down from the hills and it 
 doesn't affect the animals.           
 In 1984 lots of workmen were at Sand  
 Bay building new sea defences.This was
 done by stacking sand up along the    
 beach.This was to stop the highest    
 tides flooding the houses,which had   
 happened in the past.                 
 There are lots of boats on the sea    
 which are mainly speed boats but there
 are also yachts and fishing boats.Some
 of the fish that people catch include 
 bass,eels,flounders and dabs.
