		<title>01The Slopes of Pennard Hill</title>
		<content>  Pennard Hill is an outlier of midle  
 lias formed by land slippage after    
 Glaciation.  This well drained land   
 slopes southwards over about 2Km from 
 100m above sea level to 30-40m, where 
 there is a flat plain of lower lias   
 clay.  This is wetland needing        
 artificial drainage.  Grass is        
 abundant, so that dairy farming with  
 sheep grazing is the main occupation. 
 there are apple orchards east Pennard 
 with its 15th Century church is the   
 historic focus for the Hamlets of     
 Hembridge and Huxham Green and th     
 scattered farms.  With the loss since 
 1960's of school, postoffice and      
 resident rector the inhabitants must  
 look outside the area of amenities.   
 The hamlet of Parbrook is also without
 amenities.  The trunk road A37 (Roman 
 Fosse way) cuts across the south East 
 of the area.  Local roads are narrow. </content>
