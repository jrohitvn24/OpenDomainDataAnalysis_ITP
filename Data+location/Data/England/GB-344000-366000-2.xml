		<title>02GOWY VALLEY LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content> Great Barrow, a village with many     
 buildings of interest (see local      
 history) has 50% of property built    
 since the war. The planting of{TREES }
 by individuals &amp; retention of native  
 trees make this a very pleasant spot. 
 From the sandstone ridge on which it  
 is built it looks down on the wide    
 river valley of the Gowy which flows  
 north to the Mersey. The{ROMAN ROAD   
 (A51) runs west to Chester. The old   
 part of Guilden Sutton lies hidden in 
 a small valley with the new rising to 
 the west.Central is the ancient hamlet
 of Stamford Bridge,where the River    
 Gowy is crossed. At the western end of
 the A51 lies Littleton developed first
 in Edwardian times it has been grad_  
 ually enlarged and now straddles the  
 road.There are many old houses mainly 
{FARMS.}Many redundant farm buildings  
 have been converted to houses.        </content>
