		<title>10ULNABY HALL FARM-CONTINUED</title>
		<content> One problem with using machinery is   
 compaction of the heavy clayey soil.  
 Most of the land is artificially      
 drained, originally with clay tiles   
 and more recently with plastic piping.
{E.E.C.}grants have helped with this,  
 and also with buildings and other     
 improvements.                         
 The farm is worked by the tenant and  
 his two sons and one{employee}who     
 lives on the farm.                    
 Because the farm is beyond the{urban  
{fringe}of Darlington there are no     
 problems with vandalism or the        
 encroachment of building developments.
 Some farms nearer the town have       
 developed "Pick Your Own"             
 businesses,but Ulnaby Hall is too far 
 away to benefit from this.            
 The farm's main income is from        
 potatoes,but other crops vary in      
 profitability according to E.E.C.     </content>
