		<content> There are four main plantations in the
 area. These are managed in conjunction
 with the{Forestry Commission}agents on
 a commercial basis and all provide    
 game coverts for pheasant and grouse. 
 The two plantations north of the      
 Hipper valley have been recently      
 planted and contain deciduous and     
 coniferous trees. The main trees there
 are Norway Spruce, Scots Pine, rowan, 
 oak, silver birch, beech and sycamore.
 The spruce and pine form the major    
 proportion and therefore these        
 plantations are dominantly coniferous.
 The north west corner of the area     
 contains one plantation comprised     
 mainly of larch, Corsican Pine, and   
 silver birch which have been recently 
 planted in one area of the plantation.
 The South of the area supports one    
 coniferous plantation with the Norway 
 Spruce being the dominant tree.       </content>
