		<title>14SHOPPING AROUND RIPPINGALE</title>
		<content> A few people,mainly those without     
 their own transport,shop entirely at  
 the{local village stores}and the      
{mobile traders}but many find the      
 choice of goods rather limited and    
 expensive and prefer to use one of the
 various towns that lie within a radius
 of 20 miles,{Bourne,}5 miles away,is  
 well-used,particularly on Thursdays,  
 when there is a{street market,}held   
 since medieval days.{Peterborough}is a
 great favourite as it has a{modern    
{centre}with large stores such as John 
 Lewis and Waitrose,all easily         
 accessible from a{multi-storey car    
{park}and totally under cover.Many     
 prefer the specialist shops of{Boston,
 whose Wednesday{auctions}are very     
 entertaining.{Grantham's}Saturday     
{market}attracts many,as does{Stamford 
 with it's{historic buildings and old- 
{world charm.                          </content>
