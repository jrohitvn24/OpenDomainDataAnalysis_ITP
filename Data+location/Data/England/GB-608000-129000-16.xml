		<title>16Dykes Of Dymchurch</title>
		<content> The dykes were built to protect Romney
 Marsh from over-flooding.The dykes are
 a part of the marsh landscape.The main
 dykes lead out to the sluices.There   
 are 2 sluices in Dymchurch the Willop 
 &amp; the Marshland.The Willop is also a  
 pumping station.The water is drained  
 in the Winter &amp; left in the Summer.The
 3 months when water is most valued are
 June,July &amp; August,when it can be     
 pumped back in to the fields through  
 tile-drains.The highest the water has 
 been in the Marshland Basin is 5m.Weed
 causing blockage is a problem.The     
 Water Board keep it down by use of    
 aerial-spray,tractor-spraying &amp; chopp-
 ing by hand.They have experimented    
 with Chinese Carp,a weed-eating fish, 
 but they don't breed in England.The   
 dykes are also dredged every 10 years.
 The average depth of the dykes is 6   
 ft.                                   </content>
