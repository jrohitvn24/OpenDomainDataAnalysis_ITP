		<content> This newspaper has some interesting   
 photographic records. One such photo  
 is the old Eccles fire engine which   
 was the first in the country to be    
 powered by motor engine.              
 A previous editor of the paper was {  
 Mr.C.Jones who worked on the paper    
 from 1924-1974. He was a St.Mary's old
 boy.                                  
 Amongst the stories for the edition of
 the 26th June 1985 was one about a    
 teenage girl who had been stabbed 3   
 times in the early  hours of the      
 morning in Peel Green. The police have
 a description of a man and are        
 searching for him.                    
 Another story concerned Christine     
 Stirling, a pupil from St. Mary's     
 School. She had won a competition for 
 designing a cover for Postman Pat     
 books, organised by the library. She  
 received an 8 pound book voucher.     </content>
