		<title>01WOODSTOCK AND ITS LOCALITY</title>
		<content>  Woodstock itself is a quaint town set
in rolling Cotswold countryside. It is 
noted for many things. It attracts     
tourists because of Blenheim and its   
pubs and hotels. Although it is small  
enough to be a village, it has a Town  
Hall and is therefore a town. At the   
Town Hall, jumble sales and fetes are  
held annually for local charities.     
  East of Woodstock is Shipton-on-     
Cherwell with its cement quarry and    
recording studios. Blue Circle owns the
quarry on Bunkers Hill and digs all    
year round for limestone to make       
cement.The manor house has been bought 
by Virgin Records and converted into a 
recording studio.                      
  The farming around Woodstock is      
mostly cereal crops. Nearly all of the 
land is owned by the Duke of           
Marlborough and rented by the farmers.
