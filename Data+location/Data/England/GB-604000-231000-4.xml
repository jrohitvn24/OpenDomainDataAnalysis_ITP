 The Shire Horse Centre is in East     
 Lane.On show are sheep, peacocks,     
 rabbits, baby horses and of course    
 about eight Shire Horses.There are    
 rides on trailers. But of course you  
 have to pay Â£1 to get in. Pheasants   
 and peacocks are kept in a cages in   
 the grounds.Sometimes you can see some
 of the rabbits in their hutches.You   
 can go for lovely walks in the fields 
 and have a picnic.You can look around 
 the stables.There is a harness room   
 with displays of brasses,a beautiful  
 old caravan which a gypsy lived in.It 
 is very exiting and people come from  
 miles around to have a look at it,and 
 to buy their souvenirs.
