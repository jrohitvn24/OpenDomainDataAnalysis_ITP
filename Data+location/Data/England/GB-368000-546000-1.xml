		<content>  Alston Moor is a self-contained area 
 of approximately sixty square miles , 
 surrounded by the highest fells of the
 Pennine chain which form the water-   
 shed of three major rivers,the South  
 Tyne,Wear &amp; Tees.The town of Alston   
 stands 1,000 feet above sea level.    
 Distance from other centres of        
 population has encouraged self        
 -sufficiency &amp; Alston has a wide range
 of shops &amp; independent amenities      
 including the Cottage Hospital,Library
 &amp; Post Office. Since the closure of   
 the Alston Foundry,the major employer 
 ,the town has looked to tourism &amp;     
 small industries. The surrounding     
 fells are an attraction to walkers;the
 Pennine Way follows the course of the 
 river South Tyne close to the town.The
 fells and lower lying pasture are used
 predominantly for sheep farming.
