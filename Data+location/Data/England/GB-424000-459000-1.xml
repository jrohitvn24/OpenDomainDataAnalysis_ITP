		<title>01GENERAL SURVEY BURNT YATES</title>
		<content> Clint, Burnt Yates is situated in a   
 rural area. Burnt Yates has a very    
 nice church that was built in 1884. It
 has a small school with 31 pupils.    
 There are no shops in the village, the
 nearest being at Shaw Mills. There are
 about sixty to seventy houses many of 
 them built during the last 20 years,  
 and some being quite new. There is    
 only one new house uncompleted at the 
 present time. Many retired people live
 in the village, but there are some    
 young families and generally there is 
 a reasonably good mix of age groups. A
 major recreational facility is the    
 cricket pitch organized by Burnt Yates
 Cricket Club which has a new clubhouse
 containing changing rooms and toilets.
 Brimham Rocks and Fountains Abbey are 
 local points of interest. Rock        
 climbing, walking and fishing in the  
 River Nidd are popular.               </content>
