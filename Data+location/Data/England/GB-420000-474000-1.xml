		<content> Situated to the East of the Pennines  
 and overlooking the{VALE OF YORK,}this
 area of rolling farmland lies 6miles  
 NW of the historic city of{RIPON.}From
 rough pasture at 800ft in the West,the
 land drops eastwards to 450ft across  
 grassland drained by becks and gills  
 flowing on to the rivers{URE &amp; LAVER} 
 This scene of isolated farms, small   
 fields,winding lanes and pockets of   
 woodland focuses on 2 villages:{KIRKBY
{MALZEARD}is the larger, named from    
 Norman French for 'church in the bad  
 clearing/wood' It is a linear village 
 with towered church, market cross and 
 wide main street. 1 mile away is{     
{GREWELTHORPE}a'green'village with pond
 and ducks.The Danish'thorpe'(secondary
 settlement)suggests an offshoot of    
 Kirkby,and the'grewel'may refer to a  
 ridge of gravel here, or to a fine    
 flour once milled locally.            </content>
