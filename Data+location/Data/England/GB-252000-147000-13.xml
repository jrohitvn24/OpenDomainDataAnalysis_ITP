		<title>13         DANCING</title>
		<content> Lots of girls in our school like to go
 dancing.There are three dancing       
 schools.We can choose from tap,ballet,
 acrobatics or modern.We can take exams
 in each of these to get to a higher   
 grade.Sometimes we have a concert when
 our parents,local people and visitors 
 come to see us.Our mums usually make  
 our costumes but if they  are very    
 difficult to do we take them to a     
 dressmaker.We do shows in nearby vill-
 ages and go to other towns to take    
 part in competitions with dancing     
 schools from different areas.It is    
 good fun at Christmas because we do a 
 pantomime.Last year we did Dick Whitt-
 ington with adult singers,dancers,act-
 ors and actresses.Our dancing teachers
 husband made the scenery.Before the   
 performance,we feel very scared but   
 when we are on stage we feel very     
 proud of ourselves.                   </content>
