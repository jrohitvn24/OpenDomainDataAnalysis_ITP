		<title>07What parents do at work</title>
		<content>  Since our area is so rural the       
 majority of people have to travel to  
 work.                                 
    Pinvin and Peopleton are partly    
 dormitory villages for Worcester and  
 Pershore since many people travel to  
 these places for work.                
    In the past, market gardening has  
 provided many jobs for the people of  
 this area, but with modern machinery  
 this type of agriculture employs fewer
 people today.                         
    In a survey we conducted around our
 school the majority of parents seem to
 occupy{non-manual or professional jobs
{outside of the village}in which they  
 live.                                 
    Although{unemployment}is high in   
 Britain at the moment, job centre     
 figures indicate that our area has    
 below the national average out of     
 work.                                 </content>
