		<title>13Stoulton Garage, Stoulton</title>
		<content>   Stoulton Garage is the only petrol  
 station in the village. The building, 
 originally a house, is over 100 years 
 old and has been a garage for over 40 
 years.                                
   The garage gets a lot of custom from
 nearby towns and from people commuting
 to Worcester. The garage employs about
 twelve people including mechanics,    
 pump attendents and salesmen. The     
 times of business are 7.30 am. to 7.30
 pm. It is very busy at weekends       
 because it is the last petrol stop    
 before the M5 Motorway. The A44       
 Mainroad is a great stimulant to trade
 as it carries a lot of through        
 traffic.                              
   The garage is a Honda agency and a  
 supplier of Alfa-Romeo cars. It       
 provides mechanical servicing         
 facilities. Most of the staff live in 
 or near Stoulton.                     </content>
