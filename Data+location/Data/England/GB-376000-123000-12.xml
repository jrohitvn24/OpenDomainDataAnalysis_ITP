		<title>12A Country Living</title>
		<content> Mr.W.G.Burgess has happy memories of a
 busy country life in West Stour.He    
 went to the village school where his  
 teacher was Miss Fowles of East Stour 
 until he was old enough to leave the  
 school and work at Highbridge Mill.   
 With the outbreak of the war he went  
 to work at Manor Farm.He became a     
 skilled ditcher and thatcher,up at    
 5.a.m. and making his own thatching   
 spars at night in the woodhouse. A    
 well in the garden gave good water and
 he kept a cow.His wife made their     
 butter.He rented ground at the Lynch  
 for pigs and hens.A busy life indeed, 
 but he still found time to enjoy all  
 those happenings which make village   
 life special.He still takes a keen    
 interest in village affairs from his  
 house near the church.
