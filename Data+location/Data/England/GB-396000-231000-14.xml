		<content> There are three Anglican churches     
 located in the defined area.They are  
 at{Little Washbourne,Alstone &amp;        
{Teddington}and all were established in
 the 13th.century or before.The church 
 at Little Washbourne was declared     
 redundant in 1973.It is now used only 
 for the Alstone Sunday School's annual
 picnic,curious passing tourists       
 and trysting lovers.The villages have 
 no resident vicar and have to share   
 the services with the main churches of
{ Overbury and Beckford}which is just  
 outside this block.                   
 The main Christian festivals are      
 celebrated in these two churches but  
 marriages involving larger            
 congregations are held at Overbury.   
 However,baptisms and funerals are     
 still observed in the local parish    
 churches.                             
                                       </content>
