		<content> It was an ordinary Monday after       
 school.I was with my friend Sharon.We 
 were on our way out of Boylands paper 
 shop on Oxbridge Lane to catch        
 the bus which was on the other side of
 the road.                             
    I was silly enough to run across   
 without looking!!A big blue van       
 knocked me down although at the time I
 did not know what had happened.The    
 driver quickly got out of the van and 
 came over to me.He was very upset     
 and he put his coat over me and told  
 the paper shop to phone for an        
 Ambulance.It quickly came and I went  
 to hospital.They found out I had a    
 broken bone in my back.I suppose that 
 I was lucky not to have been killed.I 
 certainly take much more care whenever
 I cross any road now - particularly   
 Oxbridge Lane.
