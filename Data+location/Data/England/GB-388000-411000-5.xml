 precinct. It was opened on the 15th   
 September 1978, and contains a wide   
 variety of shops; the conventional    
 chainstores with some local           
 businesses.The town also has an indoor
 and outdoor market.                   
   The town has a wide selection of    
 hypermarkets such as Asda and Tesco   
 for foodstuffs; MFI and B&amp;Q for       
 furnishing; as well as Comet for      
 electrical appliances.                
   Plans are presently underway for the
 further extension of the shopping     
 precinct, which is indicative of the  
 town's healthy commercial trade.
