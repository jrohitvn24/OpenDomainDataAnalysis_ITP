		<content> Church Festivals are attended by most 
 villagers: Easter, Harvest festival   
 and Christmas. There is a Harvest     
 Supper after Evensong in the Village  
 Hall, after which some form of        
 entertainment is provided; this year  
 it was community singing. Other       
 concerts given by choirs or hand-bell 
 ringers are given in the Church once  
 or twice a year. At Christmas the     
 Sunday School puts on a Nativity Play 
 in the Hall and, with "grown-ups",    
 goes Carol Singing around the Village 
 and to the old people at Gittisham    
 Hill House.                           
 Every year during the summer holiday  
 the Sunday School organises an outing 
 or treat. This year three events took 
 place: a nature trail at Catshayes    
 farm, a treasure hunt at Combe House  
 Hotel and a Barbeque followed by a    
 rounders match at the playing field.  </content>
