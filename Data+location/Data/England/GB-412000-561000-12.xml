		<title>12A DAY IN MY LIFE.</title>
		<content> My dad wakes me at 7.15 a.m. I listen 
 to my radio fora while and then get   
 dressed. I go downstairs for breakfast
 with a cup of tea. Then I go to the   
 bathroom to clean my teeth and wash my
 face. I put on my jumper and comb my  
 hair, then leave for school, arriving 
 just before 9 a.m. Morning break is at
 10.30 a.m. The bell goe for lunch at  
 12 noon. We eat at 12.30 p.m. and go  
 back into school at 1.10 p.m.         
 Afternoon break is at 2.20 and we     
 finish school at 3.40 p.m.            
 On the way home I buy two football    
 stickers. When I arrive home I watch  
 T.V. for a while and have tea at 5    
 p.m. I play out with my friends       
  until 8 p.m. and go to bed at 8.45   
 p.m. I read until about 9.15 and then 
 go to sleep.
