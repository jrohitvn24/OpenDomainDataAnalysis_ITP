		<title>10WILSTER COPSE</title>
		<content> Wilster Copse consists of Oak, Ash,   
 and Hazel overgrown with Brambles. It 
 is inhabited by numerous birds,       
 including Blackcaps and Nightingales. 
 There are some reared pheasant for    
 shooting and a litter of foxes. There 
 are 10 beehives producing honey from  
 Bluebells, Rose Madder and hedgerow   
 blossoms.                             
                                       
 Surrounding the wood are barley fields
 separated by large thick hedges. To   
 the North wild cherries line Grims    
 Ditch which is still well defined.    
 This runs East-West into Netherton    
 Hanging, a steep bank of deciduous    
 wood recently part cleared, fenced,   
 and replanted with conifers.
