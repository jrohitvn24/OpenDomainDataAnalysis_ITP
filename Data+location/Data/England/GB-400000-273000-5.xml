		<content> St.Andrew's Church,Barnt Green was    
 built in 1909 as a Missionary church  
 between the Parishes of Alvechurch and
 Lickey.For this reason it was given   
 the name of St.Andrew,the first       
 missionary.It was never finished as a 
 building.The money saved by not       
 building a tower and a complete       
 frontage helped to finance the        
 building of the village school,also   
 called St.Andrew's School.The first   
 vicar was Rev. Percy Jones.           
{Religion}plays an important part in   
 the lives of many people in the       
 village.Each Sunday 150 people        
 attend the{service}during which       
 children leave and go to{Sunday       
{School.}In an effort to bring the     
 congregation closer together the rood 
 screen was moved into a new           
 position.This helps in the aim of the 
 Church to feel part of God's family.  </content>
