		<title>17EDUCATION &amp; SERVICE CHILDREN</title>
		<content> The education of service children     
 suffers from the necessity of its     
 parents to move at regular intervals  
 of between 18 months and 3 to 4 years.
 The child has then to readjust to a   
 new home and more importantly to a new
 school, more often than not in the    
 middle of a term and often in the     
 middle of a week or even day!         
                                       
 Standards vary immensely as a result  
 of the number and quality of schools  
 attended.                             
                                       
 Most children are gregarious,outgoing,
 superficially knowledgeable, capable  
 of holding a succint conversation with
 an adult.Their sense of humour is also
 usually immediately obvious _ perhaps 
 an inbuilt defence against the        
 instability of their pattern of home  
 life.                                 </content>
