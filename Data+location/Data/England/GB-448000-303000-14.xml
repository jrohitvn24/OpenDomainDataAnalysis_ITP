		<content> Polebrook House used to be a school   
 for naughty boys before it was closed 
 down.When we went there we were met by
 Mr Jones, the ex-headmaster.First of  
 all we went down the long corridors in
 the old building.Mr Jones said that   
 the boys used to get down on their    
 hands and knees and scrub the         
 floor.Then we went into the old dining
 hall.It was very big.I could imagine  
 allthe boys eating their meals in     
 there.Then we went to a room where    
 there was a big bath.When it first    
 opened, the bath used to be filled    
 with cold water from a well.Later on  
 it was heated.The old dormitories were
 very large and had 45 beds in rows.I  
 did not like them at all.
