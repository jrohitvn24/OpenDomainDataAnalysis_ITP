		<content>  In Sudbury there is a growing craze  
called BMX, the initials stand for     
Bicycle Moto Cross. About 350 young    
people have BMX bikes in Sudbury and   
the best place for them to ride is a   
dirt track and trick ramp at           
Woodhall Barn.                         
  There are two aspects of the sport,  
racing and   freestyle. Racing         
involves riding around a track with    
obstacles on it as fast as you can.    
Freestyle is trick riding- pulling off 
stunts on your bike. I am in a trick   
team called the Rad Lads and we show   
off our stunts to other people. The    
tricks need a great deal of skill and  
have names like Miami Hopper.
