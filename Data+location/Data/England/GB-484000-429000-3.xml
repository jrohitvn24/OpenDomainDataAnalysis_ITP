		<content>   A New Housing Estate in Newport.    
  About nine years ago,when a large new
 factory opened at Howden,a few miles  
 away from Newport,the work force      
 needed local housing to avoid a long  
 drive to work.So a site for sixty     
 houses was prepared in Newport.This   
 development is surrounded by ponds.The
 roads in the new estate are all named 
 after water birds found on the local  
 ponds,such as,Pochard Close and Grebe 
 Road.                                 
  The dwellings are semi-detatched     
 houses and bungalows.Each house has a 
 front and rear garden.This allows the 
 children who live on this estate to   
 keep pets such as rabbits,cats and    
 dogs.There are some beautiful flowers 
 in many of the gardens.Quite a few of 
 the residents like to grow vegetables.
