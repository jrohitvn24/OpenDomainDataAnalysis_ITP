		<title>15HULL AND BARNSLEY RAILWAY.</title>
		<content> Last Monday we went on a walk. We came
 to a long flat topped hill and we     
 found out that it is the embankment of
 the now disused{Hull and Barnsley}    
{Railway}- the last large independent  
 railway to be built in England. The   
 plans to build the 50 miles long      
 railway were published in 1880 and    
 it was opened in{1885}at a cost of    
 Â£4m. It was built to transport coal   
 from South Yorkshire to Hull docks.   
 After 37 years the{N.E.R.}took control
 of the line.                          
   The track was built on an embankment
 so that there would be no level       
 crossings. The line closed to         
 passengers in 1955 and finally in     
 1964. Springhead Engine Works closed  
 in 1972. Only a small section of the  
 line remains open. This year is the   
{centenary of the railway and special  
{exhibitions}are being held.           </content>
