		<title>03         Badgers</title>
		<content>    In  Silverton we are very lucky    
 to have a number of wild creatures in 
 and around the village. One animal    
 that is quite common is the badger.   
 Mr Gooding has made a study of the    
 local badgers and he told us all about
 them. He took us to look at a badgers'
 set. We saw five badgers' sets and    
 three were in use at the time with    
 about nine or ten badgers in them. The
 river Exe divdes our twelve survey    
 squares roughly in half. On the       
 Silverton side we think there are     
 about ten sets in use at any one      
 time. We would assume a similar number
 in the other half of our squares,     
 making  a total badger population of  
 about twenty used sets. Some people   
 want to kill badgers because they     
 think they have T.B., and can give it 
 to cattle.
