		<content> The area to the east of Church Fenton 
 is an arable farming area. The farms  
 are family owned and range in size    
 from 32 acres to 700 acres. Cereal    
 crops include winter wheat and barley,
 spring barley and wheat, oil seed rape
 and a few winter oats. The cereals are
 mainly used for animal feed with some 
 milling wheat and the rape for cooking
 oil. Most straw is baled and the      
 excess burnt. Important root crops are
 main crop potatoes and sugar beet. The
 sugar beet is sent to the British     
 Sugar Corporation factory in York.    
 Peas are grown for protien in animal  
 feed and other crops include          
 mangolds,turnips and kale.            
 Most farms own their own combine      
 harvester, contracters are often used 
 for sugar beet lifting and extra      
 casual labour employed for potato     
 picking.                              </content>
