 Welfare services connected with the   
 colliery have always played a major   
 part in the life of Creswell. The     
 Bolsover Colliery Company built       
 Creswell Model Village in 1897. This  
 provided housing for the miners which 
 was within a few hundred metres of the
 colliery. This housing has been       
 recently modernised, financed by      
 grants from the Government, the N.C.B.
 and a loan from the E.E.C.            
 Activities in the Miners' Welfare     
 Scheme include cricket, football,     
 bowls and a brass band.               
 There is also an active St. John's    
 Ambulance Brigade Division, which,    
 including boy and girl cadets, numbers
 150.
