		<title>04TANGIER FARM-BEEF MANAGEMENT</title>
		<content>                                       
 The management of beef farming begins 
 in early Spring when the calves are   
 bought at the market at about a week  
 old. Initially they are fed on        
 milk powder for two to three months   
 before being introduced to dry        
 cow-cake, cereals and hay. At about 6 
 months old they begin grazing on the  
 open fileds, initially on the hay     
 pasture. In the Autumn the maize      
 fields are grazed and in the Winter   
 they are fed on hay and silage. Within
 the year, the animals are sold off.   
 Some are slaughtered at the end of the
 Summer others are sold later for      
 calving and dairying.
