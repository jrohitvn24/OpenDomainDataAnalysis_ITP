		<title>01THE STIBBINGTON AREA</title>
		<content>  This area is very flat but varies    
 considerably in vegetation cover. Much
 of the land is used for intensive     
 arable farming, some of it has natural
 deciduous woodland and some has       
 plantations of coniferous trees.      
  There are four villages in the       
 area:Stibbington, Ailsworth, Sutton   
 and Waternewton. The river Nene       
 meanders eastwards through the area   
 and an old railway line also traverses
 the area beside the river.            
  The south-western corner of the area 
 is cut off from the rest of the block 
 by the major trunk road, the A1. This 
 is an important route for traffic     
 travelling between the northern and   
 southern parts of Britain.            
  Settlement in this area dates back to
 Roman times and much evidence of early
 settlements still remains.
