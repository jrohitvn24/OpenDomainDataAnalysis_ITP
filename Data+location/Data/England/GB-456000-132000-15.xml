		<title>15ALRESFORD CHILDREN'S HOME</title>
		<content>    The home,{Southdowns}, was         
 established by a Methodist Group in   
 1869. There are 23 staff at the home  
 and they look after 37 children, who  
 are handicapped or who cannot live    
 with their parents for one reason or  
 another (Perhaps there were a lot of  
 arguments or the parents could not    
 cope).                                
    The youngest child is two years old
 and the oldest is nineteen. The       
 children are not educated at the home 
 but attend the local  schools; this is
 much better for them as they then fit 
 in with 'normal' children.            
    The person in charge is known as   
 the Superintendent.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
