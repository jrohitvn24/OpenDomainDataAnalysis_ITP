		<content> In the whole of our area there are    
 about 29145 metres of{hedge.}About    
 half of this is managed by slashing or
 clipping.There are no field boundaries
 which are walls.The most common       
 species of{plants}present in our      
 hedges are Dogwood, Ash, Field maple, 
 Hazel, and Blackthorn.                
 Apart from hedges there are about     
 10461 metres of{fence.}Most of this is
 barbed wire.Since the last survey     
 there have been about 1404 metres of  
 fence or hedge constructed or grown in
 this area, and about 1250 metres of   
 field boundary has disappeared.       
 Some of the hedges have recently been 
 planted, but some are very old.The    
 oldest hedge in our area is 1200 years
 old.This can be worked out by counting
 the number of species in a certain    
 length of hedgerow.
