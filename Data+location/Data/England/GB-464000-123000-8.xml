		<content>   With few amenities in the area,     
 people have to make their own         
 entertainment. Sport plays an         
 important part in their lives, with a 
 Sports Club based in West Meon with   
 about 100 members.                    
   The club is divided into four       
 subsections - hockey, cricket, tennis 
 and football. The hockey club fields  
 two teams in the season. There are    
 three football teams and one cricket  
 team. All teams travel to all parts of
 Hampshire for away matches. Except for
 tennis, home matches are played on the
 Recreation Ground. The tennis club has
 played regularly at a private home,   
 but is at present busy fund raising to
 build two courts at the Recreation    
 Ground and then it will be able to    
 join a league.
