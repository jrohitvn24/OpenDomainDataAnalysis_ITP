		<title>16Taunton Cider - Process</title>
		<content>   Taunton Cider Co. contracts 18 acres
 of apple orchards to provide a variety
 of apples such as bitter sweet, sweet,
 sharp, and bitter sharp.  These are   
 brought in during the autumn and      
 pressed to produce 1200 litres of     
 juice from each tonne of fruit.  The  
 15% of pomace that remains is sold as 
 cattle food to local farmers.  During 
 natural fermentation a special yeast  
 is used and it is stored in oak vats. 
   The amount of sugar added to the    
 fermenting liquid depends on the      
 natural content of the apple which    
 will vary according to the weather.   
 The fermenting liquids are blended    
 depending on the product required.    
   Cider - if kept below 8.5% alcohol  
 by volume - is taxed at a lower rate  
 than beer, and Taunton Cider produces 
 a whole range from Diamond White      
 (8.2%) to the new Piermont soft drink.</content>
