		<content>{Homes}have changed a  lot since the   
 beginning of the nineteenth century.  
 The insides have changed the most.The 
 cookers have changed. Now we have     
 microwaves,fatfryers,sinks and        
 watertaps.                            
 In the nineteen twenties people       
 washed thier clothes in a wash bowl,in
 1985 we use{washing machines}to wash  
 most of our clothes  and tumble driers
 are common in many homes.             
 We have{electricity}now in Findern,in 
 the 1920's the only light was a       
 lantern.We also have a television and 
 a stereo and a 48k Spectrum and a     
 Colour Genie computer which you       
 wouldn't have in the past. I have a   
 desk where I do my homework and       
 bunkbeds in mine and my sisters       
 bedrooms. We have a flush toilet and a
 seperate{bathroom}with a bath, sink
