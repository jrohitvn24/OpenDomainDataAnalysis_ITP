At Penenden Heath there is a patch of  
ground where the grass refuses to grow.
The locals say it is due to the        
hangings that used to take place there.
The evils from the criminals buried    
there are the reason given for this    
lack of vegetation.                    
                                       
The Boxley Hotel is haunted by a butler
who committed suicide in July 1898. He 
shot himself as a result of a burglary,
thinking that he was going to be       
accused. He is said to walk through    
rooms and attempt to push people down  
the stairs.
