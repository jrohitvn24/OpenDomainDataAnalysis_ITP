		<title>03LYMM RURAL WALK</title>
		<content> We started from our school and walked 
 south into the countryside.  The walk 
 was long and tiring along quiet       
 country lanes.  We walked along       
 Lakeside Road past Lymm Dam where     
 there were large houses with long     
 drives, whilst on the other side the  
 lake of the Dam is hidden by woodland.
 At the end of the road we followed a  
 footpath through the wooded valley of 
 Bradley Brook, and through a muddy    
 area called "The Bongs".  This area is
 easily flooded.  The footpath then    
 followed the edge of the woods with   
 first fields of barley and wheat to   
 the west, and then grassed fields with
 dairy cows.                           
 We crossed a stile and on a fence     
 between two fields of wheat we saw    
 three dead moles hung up.  We         
 eventually reached the main road to   
 Knutsford.                            </content>
