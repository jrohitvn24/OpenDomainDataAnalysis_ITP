		<content> I leave my house at 8.30 a.m.to walk  
 to school.I walk along the side of the
 canal before turning right and        
 heading for the foot bridge near the  
 school.The foot bridge allows the     
 school children to cross the busy     
 dual carriage way safely.             
 The school day begins with our teacher
 taking the register.This is followed  
 by a school assembly.Afterwards we    
 return to our classroom and begin to  
 work at our maths.The timetable for   
 each day is varied.Sometimes we go to 
 one of the ponds to study the water   
 life or we might write a story.We have
 a very large playing field next to the
 school which means we can play games  
 such as football,rounders and cricket.
 We also use this field for our sports 
 day,when we have flat,potato,sack,    
 obstacle races to mention but a few.
