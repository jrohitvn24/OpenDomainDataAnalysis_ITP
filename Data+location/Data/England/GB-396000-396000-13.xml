		<content>   Nearby, a mill was being demolished.
 We had already passed a school, which 
 was standing last week, and had been  
 demolished this week. Lisa and one of 
 our teachers used to work there. The  
 school had been there for nearly a    
 hundred years.'                       
 'On Mottram Road, we passed the       
 Stalybridge Celtic Football Club. Lots
 of boys from our school support this  
 local team, as well as the major      
 Manchester teams, which are the most  
 favourite. We turned into a the only  
 right turn, which was a street of     
 nearly new houses. At the end of this 
 little estate, is Early Bank Road.    
 This is a very old cart track, which  
 leads into Cheetham Park, and through 
 the Back Fields to our school. Some   
 people who live near our school walk  
 into the Town or Park this way.
