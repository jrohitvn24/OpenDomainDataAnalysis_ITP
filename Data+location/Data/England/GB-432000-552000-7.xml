		<title>07Shiney Row Roundabout</title>
		<content>   The roundabout was officially opened
 on December 8th 1975 and now dominates
 the village of Shiney Row. It was     
 constructed at the crossroads of the  
 A183 Chester-le-Street to Sunderland  
 road and the A182 Houghton-le-Spring  
 to Washington road. This was made     
 necessary because of the construction 
 of the{A182 Washington Highway,}a main
 through route for the New Town which  
 terminates at{Shiney Row Roundabout.  
   The roundabout has transformed      
 Shiney Row into a{transport node}and  
 totally changed its character.        
   To construct the roundabout two     
 churches, two pubs and a number of    
 streets of houses were demolished and 
 the War Memorial had to be resited.   
   As Shiney Row is the major shopping 
 centre access to the shops for the    
 residents of Penshaw is now by{sub-way
 which runs under the roundabout.      </content>
