		<title>13   Why Salt Is Mined</title>
		<content>    In the past, people mined salt     
 because there were many uses for it.  
 For example,it was used for glazing   
 pottery, keeping food fresh and more. 
    Unfortunately,the imposition of    
 a tax stopped salt being used in the  
 making of any chemical. This law was  
 brought in because tons of salt a year
 was being used in making chemicals.   
 Consequently, about 60% was left for  
 household uses.                       
    Gradually, salt was becoming more  
 important and was put into chemicals  
 such as chlorine.                     
    Nowadays, we see many lorries going
 to the mine at{Meadowbank}in order to 
 collect rock salt.This is used on     
 roads to keep them free of ice and    
 snow.In the bad winter of{1976}lorries
 queued for miles to collect salt from 
 the mine.
