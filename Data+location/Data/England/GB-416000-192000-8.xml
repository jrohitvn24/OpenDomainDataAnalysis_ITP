		<title>08RECREATION CENTRE,HIGHWORTH</title>
		<content> Throughout the 1939_45 war a fund,    
 called "The Welcome Home Fund "was    
 collected to build an ex_service      
 man's club in Highworth.After the war 
 various items of land given to the    
 fund,were sold to provide money,which 
 was also raised by dances,carnivals   
 etc.A grant of money and a loan were  
 provided by Wiltshire County Council, 
 and the D.O.E. agreed 25% of the total
 cost.The land for the centre was      
 eventually sold to the Recreation     
 Centre Committee for one shilling,    
 provided that building commenced      
 within one year.Although funds were   
 still insufficient,pegging out was    
 done and load of gravel delivered,to  
 satisfy this condition.This was in    
 July 1966 and on  November 26th the   
 foundation stone was laid.The club    
 room was opened on December 3rd 1967  
 and the swimming pool in 1968.        </content>
