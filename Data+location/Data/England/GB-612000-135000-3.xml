		<title>03  LYMPNE VILLAGE.</title>
		<content>          Lympne,pronounced "Lim",is   
 the second largest village.It takes   
 its name from the ancient "River      
 Limene"In the grounds of Studfall     
 Castle is the site of a Roman fortress
 and the register of the parish church,
 St. Stephen,dates from 1611.          
          It has a Post-Office,Primary 
 school and some shops but most people 
 think the amenities are inadequate.   
          Like nearby Saltwood it is a 
 mainly residential area for the       
 surrounding towns.                    
          It has a regular bus service 
 and is near both the main-line        
 stations of Westernhangar and         
 Sandling.However,most people          
 interviewed used private transport.   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
