		<title>03A Poultry Farm:Gt.Bromley</title>
		<content>  The farm is 3 years old.{16,000}     
{chickens}are kept in 3 large sheds.   
 Two sheds are for chickens laying eggs
{ (layers)}and another is for hens kept
 for meat{(broilers)}.The layers are   
 kept 4 to a cage in multistorey rows. 
 The broilers are left loose in a      
 shed.These sheds are kept ventilated  
 by fans all year round.               
   The chickens are fed automatically  
 and altogether consume{12 tons}of food
 per week. The feed is kept in silos   
 until it is needed.The chickens are   
 cleaned out weekly and the{muck}is    
 sold to farmers for{fertilizer}.The   
 eggs are graded and packed by hand    
 in a 4th shed.                        
   The worst thing that can happen on  
 this farm is a{power cut}.If this     
 occurs the ventilation would cease and
 the chickens would{suffocate}in a few 
 hours.                                </content>
