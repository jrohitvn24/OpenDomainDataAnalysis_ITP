		<title>08ALL ABOUT CAWTHORNE PARK.</title>
		<content>    One Saturday morning we set off for
 Cawthorne park. It can be reached by  
 catching the Huddersfield bus from    
 stand 10 in Barnsley bus station.     
 After a 20 minute ride we arrived     
 there. We saw that there was a river  
 flowing through it with decorative    
 bridges and a weir. We walked along   
 beside it and then shared our dinner  
 with the ducks. These are the species 
 of duck we saw: Canada goose, Mallard,
 Teal and Grebe. We also saw a         
 Black-headed Gull. If anyone ever goes
 to Cawthorne Park we  advise them not 
 to feed the wildfowl because you end  
 up giving them nearly all of it!      
  In the park there is Cannon Hall, it 
 is a very old house.Surrounding the   
 hall are conifers (which keep their   
 leaves ) and deciduous trees ( which  
 shed them), all planted when the hall 
 gardens were landscaped.              </content>
