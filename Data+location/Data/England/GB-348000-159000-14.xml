		<content>     NEARLY ALL THE CLOTHES WE WEAR ARE
 MACHINE MADE.ONLY ABOUT 5-10% ARE     
 HANDMADE.MOST OF THE MATERIAL WE USE  
 IS COTTON(THAT'S A PLANT)AND WOOL(THAT
 COMES FROM A SHEEP).WE ALSO USE NYLON 
 AND POLYESTER WHICH ARE MAN_MADE      
 MATERIALS.RICH PEOPLE SOMETIMES HAVE  
 CLOTHES MADE OUT OF SATINS AND OTHER  
 EXPENSIVE MATERALS.                   
   ON WEEKDAYS AT OUR JOBS OR SCHOOL WE
 WEAR NEAT AND TIDY CLOTHES. ON SUNDAYS
 WHEN WE GO TO CHURCH WE WEAR SMART    
 CLOTHES.MEN WEAR SUITS OR A JACKET AND
 TROUSERS.GIRLS AND LADIES WEAR NICE   
 DRESSES AND SKIRTS,BOYS JUST WEAR     
 TROUSERS AND A SHIRT.                 
    AT OTHER TIMES WE WEAR MORE CASUAL 
 CLOTHES LIKE LADIES WEARING TROUSERS, 
 SHORTS OR A SKIRT AND OFTEN A T.SHIRT 
 OR BLOUSE.MEN AND BOYS  WILL OFTEN    
 WEAR JEANS OR SHORTS AND A T.SHIRT.
