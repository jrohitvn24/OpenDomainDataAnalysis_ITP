		<title>13ST.MARTINS CHURCH,BRASTED</title>
		<content> Our church is on a hill at the edge of
 the village. There has been a church  
 there for over 1000 years.The tower   
 was built in stages and is 700 years  
 old.It has needed repair and is to be 
 repaired again soon.                  
 Above the altar is the beautifully    
 coloured east window of magnificent   
 pictures which looks best when the sun
 shines through.On the altar,which has 
 different coloured covers during the  
 year stands a cross, candlesticks and 
 a bible on a cushion.                 
 There is a brass lectern shaped like  
 an eagle and an old carved wooden     
 pulpit that came from a church in     
 Rochester.                            
 The symbols of the evangelists,the ox,
 eagle, lion and angel are carved on   
 the ends of the choir stalls.         
 The story of St Martin the Roman,is   
 shown in glass on the south side.     </content>
