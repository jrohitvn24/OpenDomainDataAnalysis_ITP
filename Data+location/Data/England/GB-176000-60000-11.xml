		<title>11FUTURE OF THE RIVER GANNEL</title>
		<content>{Damming the River Gannel}Many hotel   
 owners want to dam the Gannel to      
 attract more holiday makers.  They    
 have arranged to pay for a feasibility
 study to see if it is possible.  By   
 flooding the estuary a lake will form 
 so that windsurfers and small boats   
 can sail there.  A dam is a huge,     
 water-retaining wall and hoteliers    
 hope that cars will be able to drive  
 round the lake and over the dam.  70% 
 of the people we spoke to were very   
 much against the dam because the lake 
 will cover a famous area of saltings  
 with special plants and wildlife which
 conservationists wish to keep.  The   
 scheme is also expensive and local    
 people do not want to pay for it.  A  
 lot of residents have made their views
 known to the Local Councils and the   
 Cornish Press.
