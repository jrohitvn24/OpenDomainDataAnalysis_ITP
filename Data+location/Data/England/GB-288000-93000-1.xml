		<title>01EXWICK  AND  ST.DAVID'S</title>
		<content>   There are three main areas in this  
 block: the central feature is the     
 village of Exwick; to the north and   
 west lie rough farm lands, and to the 
 east part of the city of Exeter.      
{  Exwick}is a fast-growing suburb of  
 Exeter, having grown by 10 times since
 World War II. Most of its inhabitants 
 work in the city, but a bakery and the
 railway remain its largest employers  
 locally.                              
   The steep{valleys}to the north and  
 west are farmed fairly intensively,   
 although the housing estates are      
 spreading year by year.               
   The{St.David's}area of the city     
 contains Exeter University, the Sixth 
 Form College, the railway station, the
 city prison, one major and many minor 
 hotels, and housing, both of the older
 terrace kind as well as modern        
 detached houses.                      </content>
