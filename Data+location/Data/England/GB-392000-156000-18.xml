		<content> There is a long tradition of amateur  
 drama in the village but the present  
 group, which consists of about 14     
 regular members, has been putting on  
 full length plays since 1970. We have 
 been helped by many people in various 
 ways and we are most grateful to them 
 all. We meet once a fortnight from May
 until the end of July for play read-  
 ing, and rehearse twice a week from   
 Sept. until the final rehearsals at   
 the end of Nov. before the chosen play
 is performed for 3 evenings in the    
 Village Hall. When all expenses for   
 each production have been met, we are 
 generally able to give donations to a 
 few deserving causes. Our members are 
 all busy people either with full time 
 careers or helping with village and   
 other activities, and we all enjoy the
 times we have together. Our current   
 production is "My Three Angels".      </content>
