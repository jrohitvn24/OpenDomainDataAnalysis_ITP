		<title>01Wray, Botton, Roeburndale</title>
		<content> Wray-with-Botton is a long strip of   
 hillside land along the River         
 Hindburn. Wray village occupies the   
 level ground at the foot of the hills 
 at the northern end. Botton is an     
 unspoilt area of woodland and         
 moorland, with scattered farms. The   
 Hindburn is bridged on the road to    
 Millhouses, a cluster of houses and a 
 former bobbin mill, and at Furnessford
 Bridge, a pretty spot. The Hindburn   
 joins the River Roeburn at Wray.      
 The Roeburn flows down from the       
 Roeburndale fells, through woodland,  
 pasture and rugged scenery. Roads lead
 out of Wray to Roeburndale East and   
 West, but this quiet and lovely dale, 
 with its old farmhouses, is best      
 explored on foot.                     
 Most walks in and around Wray give    
 fine views of the surrounding fells   
 with Ingleborough to the east.        </content>
