		<title>09Tempsford Traffic.</title>
		<content> As the second part of the traffic     
 survey we recorded the flow of traffic
 through the village and traffic which 
 turned off the A1 for Tempsford and   
 visa-versa.                           
{CHURCH END  Cars Bikes Buses Van Peds.
               21   7     0     3   7{ 
{ }                                    
{STATION END  }24   0     0     7   3  
{ENTRY                                 
{                                      
{STATION END  }26   0     0     7   0  
{EXIT                                  
 Obviously movement of traffic and     
 people in any one given hour would be 
 dependent on many factors time of day,
 weather, bus times etc,but it would   
 appear that should all exits off the  
 A1 in the area be closed this would   
 create great problems for Tempsford   
 and its inhabitants.
