		<title>12SYNCHRONISED SWIMMING.</title>
		<content> Synchronised swimming,or Synchro,is a 
 form of water ballet.Synchronised     
 means in time so each member of the   
 group must swim in time to the music  
 and each other.A nose clip is worn to 
 prevent sinus trouble,so breathing is 
 done through the mouth.Synchro is     
 split into two parts,figures and      
 routines.There are five grades in     
 Synchro and to get into the next grade
 you have to pass a test which includes
 figures and sculling.Sculling is a way
 of travelling or supporting yourself  
 using your hands only.Each grade has  
 routines,solo,duet and team which are 
 performed in competitions and judged. 
 The members of a routine wear the same
 costume and a matching headress.      
   Last summer one of the fifth year   
 girls at Greenbank was part of the    
 British Synchro team which participted
 in the Olympic Games in Los Angeles.  </content>
