		<content>{PARISH CHURCHES}The Medieval Parish   
 churches in Skeffling and Easington   
 are built on a traditional vernacular 
 cruciform style.The fabric materials  
 are mainly of beach cobbles (rounded  
 stones), Tadcaster stone brought down 
 by barges to the river shore,and old  
 hand made bricks.                     
{ IN SKEFFLING}there is only one church
 which has recently been renovated.It  
 is called St.Helens and it looks fresh
 and sparkling.There is no electricity 
 in the church. In Easington there is  
 the Parish Church of All Saints ,a    
 derelict Primitive Methodist Chapel   
 (1851) and a Wesleyan Chapel(1850)    
 which is still in use.                
  {ALL SAINTS EASINGTON}was built in   
 the 12th Century but the Saxons       
 probably had a church on this site.   
 Easington,and Skeffling share a vicar.
