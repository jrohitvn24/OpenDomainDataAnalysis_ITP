		<content> Tunstall is a small village with 37   
 houses and 9 farms.Its only amenity is
 the church end church hall.The        
 villagers must travel to Roos or      
 Withernsea for their shopping.There is
 a distinct contrast between the       
 village of Tunstall and its main      
 attraction:the Caravan Site at Sand le
 Mere.The site has permanent and       
 touring caravans,a camp shop,a        
 resturant,fish and chip shop, and a   
 nightclub/pub.Most tourists appear in 
 the summer months but some use the    
 site for weekend stays all year round.
 The beach is the other attraction at  
 Tunstall being only half a mile from  
 the village.The cliffs are clay and in
 many places they have been eroded.The 
 main employment in Tunstall is        
 farming.
