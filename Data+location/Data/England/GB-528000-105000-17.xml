		<content> The club was fomed in 1900 and has    
 played at Goldstone football ground   
 since 1902.                           
 The team does quite a lot of training,
 about 5 mornings and 2 afternoons a   
 week during the season. They also     
 follow a careful diet.                
 At most matches there are about 12,000
 supporters who are normally well      
 behaved: hooligans are thrown out.    
 There is a supporters' club and there 
 are individual fan clubs for the      
 players.                              
 The colours of the club are blue,     
 white and yellow. The pitch is sown in
 Cumberland seed, is mown three times a
 week and is one of the best in        
 England.
