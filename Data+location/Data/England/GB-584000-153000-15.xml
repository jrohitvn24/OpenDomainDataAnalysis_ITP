		<title>15THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT</title>
		<content>     The area is one of great natural  
 beauty with its sweeping chalk hills, 
 wide open farmland and meadows and    
 generous woodland. There is a great   
 abundance of wildlife and we found    
 many varieties of wild flowers during 
 our walks including some beautiful    
 orchids. Lizards and snakes are       
 regularly seen and slow-worms are     
 common visitors to the school.        
     The area is criss-crossed by many 
 bridle-ways and footpaths, the most   
 famous being the Pilgrim's Way, and   
 many walkers visit the area to sample 
 the magnificent views from the downs. 
 Horse riding is also a very popular   
 local pastime. Many of the footpaths  
 lead into almost impenetrable woods   
 where there are numerous pheasant runs
 and many "interesting" finds to be    
 made such as ancient abandoned farm   
 machinery and old bottles.            </content>
