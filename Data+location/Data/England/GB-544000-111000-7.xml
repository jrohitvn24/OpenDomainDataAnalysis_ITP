		<content> The{Church of England,}which is part  
                                       
 of the{Anglican}communion, meets      
 in the Parish Church of{St. Mary the  
{Virgin,}the construction of which     
 dates back to Norman times.  The{bell 
{tower}has eight bells including a     
 tenor weighing 11.5 cwt. and a{       
{"peoples' bell"}paid for by the       
 parishioners.  This year brought the  
 centenary of the very first peal.     
 The{Roman Catholics}celebrate the     
 "First Mass of Sunday" on Saturday    
 evenings in the Parish Church.  There 
 are also three non-conformist         
 churches: the{Free Church}meets in the
 Village Hall, the{United Reform Church
 has its own small chapel and the{     
{Pentecostal Church}meets in a hut on  
 the Green.  All churches meet on      
 certain occasions for United Worship.
