		<content> In this area the land is primarily    
 used for cattle, but there are also   
 many potatoes grown. There are also an
 increasing number of fields used for  
 horticultural crops, growing shrubs,  
 trees &amp; herbaceous plants for the     
 nearby Bridgemere Nursery. Although   
 the O.S. map refers to Parrah Green,  
 the village is known as Bridgemere.   
 There is a wildlife park here, which  
 has many wild animals &amp; birds, both   
 from this country &amp; abroad, enclosed  
 &amp; on show to the public. Until last   
 year Doddington Hall was a private    
 school known as Goudhurst College; it 
 is currently unused, but an           
 application for change of use to      
 offices has just been granted.        
 Bridgemere has a primary school with a
 roll of sixty-four children.
