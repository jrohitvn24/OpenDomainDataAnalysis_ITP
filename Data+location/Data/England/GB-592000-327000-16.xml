		<title>16Fakenham School Barbeque</title>
		<content> On 13th July 1985 we had a barbeque at
 the Infant School. Some of the parents
 cooked beefburgers and hot dogs for us
 to buy and there was a selection of   
 savoury dips with carrot sticks,      
 celery and cucumber. There was cola   
 and lemonade for the children and wine
 or cider for the adults. When we first
 arrived we played punch-ball rounders 
 or football. In the rounders the      
 adults bowled and fielded and the     
 children batted by punching the ball. 
 After the games and food we had       
 country dancing with instructions     
 called out for those who didn't know  
 the dances. When we were worn out,    
 Mrs. Colman (one of our teachers) and 
 her husband played their guitars so   
 that we could all join in and sing.   
 Most of us wore jeans or casual       
 trousers or dungarees and T-shirts or 
 sweatshirts.                          </content>
