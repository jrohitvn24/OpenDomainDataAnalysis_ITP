		<title>09HOUSING ARCHITECTURE,OXSHOTT</title>
		<content> The architecture reflects the history 
 of the area over the last 100 years.  
 There are very few examples of houses 
 built before the 1880's and it was the
 opening of the railway in 1885 that   
 triggered off the growth of Oxshott   
 and its development into a "Dormitory 
 district".                            
 In square 7,off the Leatherhead       
 Road,there is a good example of a     
 genuine black and white Tudor cottage 
 which has been gentryfied. Nearly all 
 the houses are well kept,the gardens  
 are big and nearly all the houses are 
 first class,with garages, driveways   
 and some with their own swimming pools
 or tennis courts, some with both.     
 In all areas there are many burgular  
 alarms on the houses and most have    
 individual name plates carved from    
 wood, or in pottery or wrought iron or
 painted.                              </content>
