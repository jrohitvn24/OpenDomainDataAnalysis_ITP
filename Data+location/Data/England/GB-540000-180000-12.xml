		<title>12OUR HOMES</title>
		<content> We live in families each one in its   
 own home - mostly houses with gardens.
 Farthers work all day or in shifts,   
 about half the mothers work too. The  
 jobs are in service industries,       
 offices and a few in shops, factories 
 or as drivers. Children are at school 
 five days a week about 40 weeks in a  
 year from 5 to 16. Lucky ones go to   
 Nursery from age 3 to 5.              
 What would we do without electricity ?
 Lighting, heating, cooking, fridge,   
 freezer, food mixer, washing machine  
 etc. We would really miss them.
