		<content>    I usually wake up at 7.30am, get   
 dressed and go down to wash. Then I   
 have my breakfast which is wholemeal  
 (granary) toast and jam with coffee.  
 I often read my Eagle comic or the    
 newspaper during breakfast. I then    
 clean my teeth and walk to Cromwell   
 School sometimes with my dad who      
 teaches there. If it is a day when I  
 have music I have to take my French   
 horn to practise.                     
    When I get to school I meet my     
 friends in a form room. When the bell 
 rings at 8.50am I go to my form room  
 for registration. Before normal       
 lessons we have a school, house or    
 year assembly. I go home for dinner   
 between 11.55 and 1.10pm. Afternoon   
 lessons finish at 3.45.               
    After school I often shop for my   
 mum and do my homework. After tea at  
 6.00 I see my friends. Bed is at 9.00.</content>
