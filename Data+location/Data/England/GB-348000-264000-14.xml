		<title>14     BRIMFIELD COMMON</title>
		<content>{Brimfield Common}is thirty two and a  
 half acres in size. We think it now   
 belongs to the local Council but we   
 are not sure. If you buy a house on or
 near the Common you usually buy some  
{Common rights,}these allow you to keep
 so many animals on the Common, the    
 exact number of each type are stated  
 in the deeds of the house.The road    
 across the Common is very rough indeed
 and we think it ought to be looked    
 after a little better! Most of the    
 land is used for{grazing}but some of  
 it is unfit because it is so marshy.  
 We saw cows, sheep and goats when we  
 visited it. Some of the birds we saw  
 were{magpies, peewits, crows and      
{robins.}There are quite a few houses  
 around the edge of the Common, some of
 their names are: Little Shortgrove,   
 Adams Cottage, The Hollies, Prestley  
 Croft, Elmleigh and Tinknor Cottage.  </content>
