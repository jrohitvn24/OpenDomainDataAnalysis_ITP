		<content> Due to mechanisation,{few people      
{remain in agriculture}but commute to  
 towns;thereby forcing agricultural    
 wages to compete with other trades.   
 Women,who would once have worked on   
 the land,now try to find alternative  
 jobs to fit in with domestic          
 arrangements.{Greater affluence}means 
 an increase in home ownership,larger  
 houses,possession of private transport
 and consumer products.Town dwellers   
 often move into villages,buy average  
 priced houses and balance the loss of 
 population caused by a lower birth    
 rate.Because of{centralisation of     
{community services}and the decline of 
 public transport, it is felt that,    
 although we have a better standard of 
 living,the quality of life is often   
 lower.To counteract this,an effort is 
 being made to revitalise the Church   
 and other village activities.         </content>
