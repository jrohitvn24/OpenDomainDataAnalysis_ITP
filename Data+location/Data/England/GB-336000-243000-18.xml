		<content> BYFORD VILLAGE HALL                   
 In 1963 the old village school was    
 handed over to the parishes of Byford 
 and Mansell Gamage as a Village Hall. 
 In 1984-85 the building was decorated,
 floors polished, coal fired stoves    
 removed and new heaters fitted. It is 
 mainly used by Byford &amp; District WI,  
 the over 60's club, Parish Council,   
 Garnons shooting parties and for whist
 drives and private parties. An import-
 ant event is Byford Harvest Supper    
 when many villagers join in.          
 BYFORD CRICKET TEAM                   
 Byford also has a cricket team drawn  
 from the surrounding villages which   
 plays friendly matches on most        
 weekends during the season.
