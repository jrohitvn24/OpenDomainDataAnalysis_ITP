		<title>20CHANGING TIMES IN COCKFIELD2</title>
		<content>We asked Mr.White what were the        
greatest changes that had taken place  
since 1945 in this part of Cockfield   
and in the lives of the residents.He   
said that the coming of piped water to 
replace well water and the coming of   
electricity to replace oil lamps and   
candles.Washing powders and washing    
machines had made ladies' lives much   
easier.The gardens were much neater    
and there were far more lawns now      
with most people owning lawn mowers.In 
those times 40 years ago children were 
lucky if they had 1 penny pocket money.
We also asked Mr.White if he would like
to go back to those times and he said  
"No". There was too much hard work to  
do in the house and there were many    
really poor families then,whose        
children had poor food and little of   
it.Children played with iron and wood  
hoops,spinning tops and marbles.       </content>
