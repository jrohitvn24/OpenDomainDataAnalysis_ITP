		<title>08Settlements-Hewshott</title>
		<content>{ Hewshott}is a very small settlement  
 situated along a small winding country
 lane between{Hammer Bottom}and        
{Liphook.}The majority of houses are   
 old with large grounds, but others are
 modern. The occupants are mostly      
 elderly and retired.                  
  The village is dominated by Hewshott 
 House, it is rather large and has two 
 flats attached.The flats were         
 below the standards of the rest of the
 village. The grounds are quite large  
 and have many large trees.            
 There is a riding school but some     
 houses have their own horses and      
 stables. There is also a small estate 
 which has some quite modern houses.   
  Some of the fields along Hewshott    
 Lane were planted with cereals whilst 
 others were just rough grassland.     
 Penally Farm has horses, cows and     
 several old barns. There are no shops </content>
