		<content>{Friday.}1.When I get home, I get      
 changed and if I have any homework to 
 do, I do that first. If I have any    
 spare time, I watch TV or listen to my
 radio. After tea, I go to my guitar   
 lesson at half past five for half an  
 hour. Sometimes I play with my brother
 until 7 o'clock, then I watch TV until
 10 o'clock when I get ready for bed. I
 read until 11 o'clock and then go to  
 sleep.                                
    2. When I get home, I get changed  
 and watch TV until tea-time. After    
 tea, me and my brother get ready for  
 choir practice at church. The         
 choirmaster tells us whether there is 
 a wedding on Saturday. If there is,   
 when we go we get Â£1. Then we practice
 the hymns for Sunday. After choir     
 practice,we are so tired, we go to bed
 when we get home.
