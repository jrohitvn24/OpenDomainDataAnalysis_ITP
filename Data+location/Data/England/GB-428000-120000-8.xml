		<title>08EMPLOYMENT IN EAST WELLOW</title>
		<content> Many of the people in East Wellow are 
 farm workers.This is because the area 
 is mainly made up of farm land. There 
 is little other local employment as it
 is difficult to get planning          
 permission granted for factories or   
 other businesses in this rural area.  
                                       
 There are two shops in the area but   
 these of course just employ their     
 owners and families. Other people in  
 the area must go out to the nearby    
 major towns of Salisbury,Southampton  
 and Winchester and to such employers  
 as IBM in Hursley and Plessey near    
 Romsey.                               
                                       
 There are some simple jobs like       
 grass cutting but these are mainly    
 part_time. There are a few            
 self_employed people eg a blacksmith. 
 There are also many retired people.   </content>
