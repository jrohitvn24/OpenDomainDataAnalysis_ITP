		<title>02Views on Darwen - a Survey</title>
		<content>  Over half the interviewees had lived 
 in Darwen for more than fifteen years 
 and of the remainder,most felt that   
 Darwen was a better place than their  
 previous towns.                       
   People were equally divided between 
 those who felt that the enviroment    
 (parks,leisure facilities  etc.)were  
 adequate, and those who saw a need for
  improvement.                         
   The great majority criticized       
 shopping facilities in the town, and  
 it was felt that inadequate provision 
 was being made for the needs of       
 children.                             
   Although two thirds of those        
 interviewed belong to a church, very  
 few take part in any neighbourhood    
 activities.Financially Darweners are  
 thought to be comfortable with few    
 being poor.It is seen as a small      
 friendly town near to the country.    </content>
