		<title>07THE SCHOOL DAY</title>
		<content>  The school day begins at 9 o'clock   
 in the morning.The children learn many
 subjects including reading,mathematics
 craft,and games.                      
  Eeach lesson lasts a different length
 of time but the children do have a    
 break at10.30 AM until 11.00AM,and    
 dinner time lasts for 1hour starting  
 at 12.15.                             
 In the afternoon lessons consist of   
 many activities associated with the   
 above subjects.The school day ends at 
 3.30pm for the infants and 4.00pm for 
 the junior children.                  
  Occasionally the children go out on  
 school visits to places such as the   
 local farm or other places of         
 interest.                             
  Because this is the only primary     
 school in the area some have to travel
 from surrounding settlements like     
 Twyford.                              </content>
