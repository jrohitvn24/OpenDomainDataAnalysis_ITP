		<title>12Butlin's Holiday Camp</title>
		<content> In 1936 William Butlin,who came from  
 Canada,built the camp which the family
 kept until 1977 when it was bought by 
 the Rank Organisation.At the outbreak 
 of war,in 1939,the Admiralty took it  
 over as a training establishment and  
 named it H.M.S.Royal Arthur.On the    
 German radio they twice claimed they  
 had sunk it! In 1946 it was re-opened 
 to 4,000 holiday makers on full board.
 During the Fifties and Sixties the    
 number catered for increased to 12,000
 but as the accommodation has been up- 
 graded with private baths and toilets,
 the maximum is now 8,000.In 1967 self-
 catering chalets  were first built and
 1985 saw the first sites established  
 for tourers at Â£8 per night.The camp  
 was flooded in 1953 and fire destroyed
 a section in 1972.For today's visitor 
 Butlin's provides every possible      
 entertainment and amenity.            </content>
