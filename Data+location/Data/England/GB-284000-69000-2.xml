		<title>02TOWN PLANNING DISPUTES</title>
		<content>{Teignbridge District Council}have     
 decided to sell the 11 acre site at { 
{Penn Inn}to the{Co-op}for{Â£1.6        
{million.}They want to build a{40,000  
 square foot{supermarket}at Penn Inn   
 which is a{recreation area}that       
 includes an open air swimming pool.The
 plan has already led to the raising of
 a{2,000}signature petition of protest.
{The Penn Inn Action Committee}have    
 asked their Member of Parliament to   
 set up a{public inquiry}to stop it.{  
{The Action Committee}think that the   
 store will cause traffic conjestion,  
 take trade from the town, and deprive 
 children of their recreation area.    
 Another planning wrangle taking place 
 is over plans to extend the out       
 of town shopping complex at{Trago     
{Mills.}There are fears that this will 
 lead to Newton becoming a ghost town.
