		<title>17LIVING IN CHADDESLEY CORBETT</title>
		<content> Why I like living in Chaddesley       
 Corbett by Helen aged 9 years.        
 I like living in Chaddesley Corbett   
 because I have nothing to worry about 
 like getting knocked over by a big    
 lorry rushing past. I like living in  
 Chaddesley because the air is fresh   
 and not smelly from all the factories 
 which a lot of people live by in the  
 towns. All my friends live where I    
 live because they like the pleasant   
 countryside and the fresh air, so I   
 have company.                         
 A lot of things happen in Chaddesley. 
 Brownies and Guides are held in the   
 village hall.                         
 Another reason I like living in       
 Chaddesley is because I can play out  
 in our street called Hemming Way. I   
 like living in Chaddesley because of  
 everythig.
