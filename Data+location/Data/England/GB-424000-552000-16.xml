		<title>16MOBILE SHOPS</title>
		<content>   Most people did use the shops in    
 Ouston at least once a week but mainly
 for convenience or if they had run out
 of something. Almost everybody would  
 like to see more choice of shops in   
 the village but realised that this    
 would probably mean higher prices.    
 Only elderly people and those mothers 
 who were at home with young children  
 all day used the local shops on a     
 regular basis.                        
   There are also a number  of mobile  
 shops that travel around the village  
 regularly but very few people seemed  
 to use them,less than 20%,so they did 
 not seem to be very profitable.
