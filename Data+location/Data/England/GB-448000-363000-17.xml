		<content> The Meden Trail is a very popular walk
 for the young and old alike,          
 particularly in summer and fine       
 weather. Along the country trail can  
 be found picnic areas where tables and
 benches are a fixture and picnic      
 lunches can be enjoyed. The Swann Inn 
 is very old and people did not seem to
 know much about it, apart from the    
 fact that it is the central feature of
 the village by the village green and  
 was a popular stopping off and        
 visiting place for people travelling  
 to Chesterfield from Mansfield.       
 The feeling of the people towards the 
 new old people's flats are mixed. Some
 people think that they are a big      
 improvement on the old terraced houses
 whilst others preferred the terraced  
 houses, saying that they were far more
 homely.The older people were more in  
 favour of the houses.                 </content>
