		<title>16SPORT IN NEWICK</title>
		<content> The first record of a cricket match in
 Newick is 10th.May 1722 when they lost
 to Hurst. The present Cricket Club has
 been in existence since 1884, playing 
 first on the Green, then on the old   
 workhouse field and more recently on a
 playing field near Church Rd. Cricket 
 became a great tradition in Newick,   
 its most famous cricketers being James
 and John Langridge who played for     
 Sussex, and James for England. Cricket
 weeks became the fashion, and the     
 visiting Australian Test team always  
 played their first game here.         
 Other thriving sports are football,   
 stoolball (a uniquely Sussex game),   
 badminton, bowls, tennis and rugby.   
 Many other activities are organised in
 Newick such as amateur dramatics,horse
 shows, two W.I.groups, brownies, cubs,
 guides and scouts, Darby and Joan, a  
 horticultural club, and many more.    </content>
