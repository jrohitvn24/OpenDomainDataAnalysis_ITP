		<content> The house bears the date 1503 on the  
 end wall. Half timbered and plastered,
 it is entered by a wooden porch with  
 18th C balusters at the sides. The    
 hallway is small with a staircase of  
 late 17th C and a large fireplace.    
 Above this are the Royal arms         
 encircled by the Garter and flanked by
 the initals "ER".                     
 Queen Elizabeth I is thought to have  
 stayed here in 1534. Her room has     
 original lead paned windows and       
 moulded oak panelling. The ceiling    
 bears royal designs in the plaster,   
 fleur de lis, crowns, feathers and    
 acorns. There are many oak beams in   
 the house with curious, holes and     
 notches in them. They were once       
 ships' beams. Originally the home of  
 John Porter, it is now owned by Mr and
 Mrs Wootten.
