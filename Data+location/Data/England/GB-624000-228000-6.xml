		<title>06A day in the life of Ursula</title>
		<content> When I wake up in the morning I like  
 to read my book before getting up and 
 having breakfast.My mum calls me and  
 my brother Karl when breakfast is     
 ready.I have a little play with the   
 dog and at 8.30am I walk to school.At 
 school today I wrote a poem about     
 sand, did some maths and had Assembly 
 with hymns and prayers before we went 
 out to play.Afterwards we had to      
 practice for Sports Day.In the        
 afternoon we heard a story about a Big
 Friendly Giant. When I got home from  
 school at about 3.30pm I got changed  
 before going to play. Today we played 
 tents,then we went in to watch        
 television before having tea. After   
 that I had a bath and went to bed at  
 7.30pm
