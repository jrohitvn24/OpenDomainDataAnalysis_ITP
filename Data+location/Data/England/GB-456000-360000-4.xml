		<title>04LEISURE AT FOREST TOWN</title>
		<content>      We live in a village called      
 Forest Town. There are sports clubs   
 and bowls for men. For women there is 
 dancing and for children there are    
 clubs and a band.                     
      Men in Forest Town go to sports  
 clubs . Men play football, tennis,    
 bowls and running.                    
      There are some allotments down   
 the Avenues that people will go to    
 every spare minute they have got.At   
 home you can cook nice food like      
 cakes, biscuits and pies.You could    
 paint, draw or make things. Quite alot
 of people do sewing or knitting or    
 even make clothes for their children. 
      These are the things that we do  
 in our spare time in Forest Town.
