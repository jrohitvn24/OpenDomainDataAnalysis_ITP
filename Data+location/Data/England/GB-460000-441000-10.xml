		<content>{Granny in the kitchen.                
 A skipping game we play is "Granny in 
 the kitchen".Two people turn a rope   
 and another two skip.There is a rhyme 
 which you say as you skip:"Granny in  
 the kitchen,doing a bit of stitching, 
 in came the bogey man and pushed      
 Granny out". When "pushed Granny out" 
 is said one person goes in and the    
 other goes out.                       
{How to play "Blockey 1,2,3".}         
 Somebody is the catcher;she stands at 
 the blockey post and counts to 50.    
 Everyone else has to run away and     
 hide.The aim is to get back to the    
 blockey post without being caught,    
 saying "Blockey 1,2,3" and your name. 
 If the catcher gets back first she    
 says "Blockey 1,2,3" and the other    
 person's name.The person caught first 
 is the next catcher.                  
 These are our 2 most popular games.   </content>
