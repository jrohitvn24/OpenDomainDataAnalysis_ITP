		<content>   My Dad works for the J.E.C, which   
 means Jersey Electric Company. It is a
 big firm that employs hundreds of     
 people. There is a large shop in St.  
 Helier that sells electrical goods and
 people pay their bills there. My Dad  
 works in an Office at Queen's Road. It
 is inside the central stores. He is in
 charge of deliveries and gives the van
 drivers their jobs. He likes his work,
 but is very busy, especially when they
 have the sales. He works on a computer
 and puts in information. He is in     
 charge of 14 men and has a boss called
 Tony who runs the stores. He has      
 worked at the J.E.C. for 14 yars. He  
 gets good holidays and has the first  
 Monday off every month. My Dad doesn't
 do overtime unless he has to. He      
 starts work at 8.00 a.m. and finishes 
 at 5.00 p.m.
