		<title>05River Exe through Tiverton</title>
		<content> The River Exe runs right through      
 Tiverton and splits the town into two 
 parts.  Just to the south of the town 
 it is joined by the River Lowman which
 is much smaller. It is because these  
 two rivers could be crossed at this   
 point that our town is called         
 Tiverton, from the Saxon "Twyfordton",
 meaning Two-Fords-Town.               
 To the west of the River Exe is the   
 Heathcoat Textile Factory.  The river 
 used to provide the power for the     
 factory machines by a leat (canal)    
 which was made to run through it.  In 
 1960 there was a terrible flood in the
 town and this caused so much damage   
 that new (and rather ugly) concrete   
 flood barriers have been put up along 
 the riverbanks in the town.           
 The river is good for fishing (trout, 
 salmon eels etc) and canoeing. A Raft 
 Race is held every year for charity.  </content>
