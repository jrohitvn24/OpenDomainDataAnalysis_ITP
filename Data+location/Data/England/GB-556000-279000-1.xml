  Our 4 by 3 kilometre area is situated
 to the east of the cathedral city of  
 Ely,Cambridgeshire.It is part of      
 Fenland and has a peat soil which is  
 black.These black fens start a few    
 miles north of Cambridge and almost   
 reach to Peterborough in the west and 
 Wisbech in the north.                 
    Our area is very flat,almost       
 hedgeless and treeless,with islands of
 higher ground where towns and villages
 have been built.The cathedral in Ely  
 dominates the skyline.                
    The River Ouse runs north-south    
 in the north-west corner of our       
 area.The railway line crosses it at   
 right angles.An embankment runs       
 west-north-west across our area.There 
 is a small village and factory.Arable 
 farming is the main occupation and    
 there are four farms.                 </content>
