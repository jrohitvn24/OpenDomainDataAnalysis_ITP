 club has visited lessons to talk about
 life in Cranford during the Second    
 World War; he has gone on many visits 
 to museums and other places of        
 interest , including India, with      
 pupils and staff; and attends every   
 school event. There are lots of       
 activities for elderly people at the  
 school.                               
 Several members of staff have, as     
 part of their job, to work in the     
 community. The Community Arts Teacher,

 ballets, art displays and runs a drama
