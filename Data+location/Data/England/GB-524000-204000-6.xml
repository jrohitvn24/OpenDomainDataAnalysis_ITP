		<title>06Brookmans Park and Nepal</title>
		<content>     1985 is a year in which England   
 and other countries are trying to help
 the third world countries.Brookmans   
 Park chose to help Nepal.We are       
 helping by sponsoring an engineer and 
 a nurse to live in Nepal.The engineer 
 is teaching the people to mend simple 
 machinery and the nurse is trying to  
 improve the health in Nepal.          
    To make people think of Nepal,six  
 Gurkha soldiers came over to Village  
 Day.There have also been lots more    
 money raising activites,such as a     
 Nepalese evening where Nepalese type  
 food was served and many other events 
 that will raise money for the families
 in Nepal.It is very appropriate for   
 Brookmans Park to help Nepal because  
 we are a well off area and Nepal is   
 very poor.
