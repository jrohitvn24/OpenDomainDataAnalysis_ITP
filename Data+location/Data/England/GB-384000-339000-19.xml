		<content>4. Hide and Seek. One child is the     
seeker. The other children hide        
(anywhere in the street or garden)     
while the seeker counts slowly to a    
given number. The seeker then searches 
for the children. The last one found is
the winner. The first one found is the 
new seeker.                            
5. Off Ground Tick. Same as (3) but any
child standing off the ground is 'safe'
and cannot be touched.                 
6. Line Tick. Variation of (3). When   
touched you join the chaser's team. The
last one touched is the winner.        
7. Hop Scotch. A numbered grid is drawn
 out with chalk on the ground. A stone 
has to be thrown on each numbered      
square in turn and the player hops over
all the squares other than the one with
 the stone on it. If the stone goes    
onto the wrong square the players turn 
ends.                                  </content>
