		<title>18Blue Doors Farm</title>
		<content>   Blue Doors farmhouse stands close to
 the A143 Haverhill to Bury St.Edmunds 
 road and belongs to Mr. John Deeks.The
 house is a listed building,exact date 
 unknown.                              
   Mr.Deekshas lived here for          
 twenty-five years and his family hsave
 always been farmers.He and his son    
 Robert work ninety acres,sown at the  
 moment with wheat and oil-seed rape.  
   The farm is very close to Highpoint 
 Prison-the former R.A.F.Stradishall-  
 and Mr.Deeks has made many friends    
 among the officers."R.A.F.personnel   
 move around from place to place,but   
 prison officers are more permanent,so 
 you can get to know them."            
   Mr.Deeks is a familiar figure at    
 local summer fetes in his bright      
 yellow cart,pulled by a pony.
