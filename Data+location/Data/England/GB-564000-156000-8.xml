   The Malling Citizens' Advice Bureau 
 is situated within the Clout Memorial 
 building in the High Street. It has an
 office in which are kept numerous     
 files and reference material necessary
 to deal with the many and diverse     
 queries. The Bureau is open from 10 to
 1.00 p.m. Tuesday to Friday and from  
 10 till 4.00 p.m. on Monday. It is    
 staffed by the organiser and her      
 deputy, who are responsible for the   
 administration, and at present by     
 twelve voluntary workers. Two         
 solicitors also give free advice. Each
 worker has been appointed and approved
 by the management committee who are   
 representative of the main local      
 interests. Training has to be         
 undertaken on courses, in-service work
 and later more specialised work       </content>
