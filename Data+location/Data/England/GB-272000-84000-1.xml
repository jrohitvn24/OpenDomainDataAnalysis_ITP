 Moretonhampstead is a small moorland  
 town that lies on the Eastern slopes  
 of Dartmoor.It is a crossroads for    
 most of the traffic that travels on   
 the moors.Two buildings of note stand 
 out:the Almshouses and the Church     
 which dominates the surrounding       
 area.Most of the other buildings are  
 more recent having been replaced after
 fire.Near Moreton there are several   
 tors such as Houndtor,Haytor and many 
 others.The Almhouses were built in    
 1637 AD on the site of a medival      
 hospital.The nave of the Church was   
 built in the 14th century,the chancel 
 was built in the 20th century and the 
 rest of the church was built in the   
 15th century.The tower is approximatly
 90 feet high.
