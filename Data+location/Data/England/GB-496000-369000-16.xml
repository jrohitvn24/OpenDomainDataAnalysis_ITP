		<content> The pedestrianised section of the High
 Street  passes  through  the {Stonebow
 which dates from the late{15th century
 It  stands  on the  site  of the south
 gate of the  Roman town. The{Guildhall
 above is  panelled  and has a splendid
 timber roof. On the roof is  the {Mote
{Bell (1371),}still  rung  to  summon  
 council  meetings  today. The {civic  
{treasures }include  the  chains  and  
 badges  of office. There are the three
 swords, one presented  by {Richard II,
{Henry  VII's }sword  and one presented
 by{Charles I}in{1642.                 
 The  main  use of the Guildhall is for
 the {council  chamber.}At  present the
 council  has a{Labour}majority. Recent
 decisions  have  included the building
 of a {northern  link  road }to  ease  
 traffic congestion around the north of
 the city and the  declaring of Lincoln
