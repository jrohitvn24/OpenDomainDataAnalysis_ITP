		<content>  A random sample was taken from 235   
 homes. It showed the changing trends  
 of employment over three generations, 
 means of transport and distances      
 travelled to work.{Mellor}is a rural  
 area with many hill farms and grazing 
 stock, while{Marple}has grown from a  
 village into a thriving town.         
  Once, mills associated with the      
 cotton industry, and small coal mines 
 brought people to the district, but as
 they declined people moved away and   
 houses were left empty. As the roads  
 were improved and the railways built  
 people could travel further to work.  
 The area then became ideal for        
 commuters.                            
{ 95% of fathers}in the sample are     
{employed}leaving{5% unemployed.}The   
 official figure for mthe area is      
 5.56%, well below the national        
 average.                              </content>
