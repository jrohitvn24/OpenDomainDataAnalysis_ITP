 Garden House lies on the southern     
 outskirts of the village.It is a large
 detached house with a floor area of   
 2,500.sq.ft. and 13 rooms including   
 the cellar.It was built between 1730  
 and 1784 and was at one time the home 
 of the Dixon family.Named because it  
 had spectacular gardens of 3 acres,it 
 has lost 1 acre of ground at each side
 on which 2 modern bungalows have been 
 built.Although the house has been     
 modernised it's structure has not been
 altered.The old stone slates from the 
 roof are now used as paving stones in 
 the garden.The present owners who     
 brought the house in Feb 1985 are very
 proud to own the home of such famous  
 men and are anxious to find out more  
 about the Dixons brothers.
