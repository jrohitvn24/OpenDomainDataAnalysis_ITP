		<title>10SHOPPING IN TYDD ST. GILES</title>
		<content>    In this village we have two        
 shops.The two shops are very near each
 other,in fact they are on the same    
 road,Church Lane.                     
    One of our shops is called the     
 Corner Shop,and was built in 1945,so  
 it's about 40 years old.It sells      
 general things and petrol and you can 
 buy almost anything there.The number  
 of people that comes to the Corner    
 Shop varies, but I would think is     
 about 80 a day .The shop is owned by  
 the Quinns.                           
    The corner shop is on a T junction 
 so lots of people see it,not like the 
 Post Office which is our other        
 shop.The Post Office is hidden in some
 trees near the Church so people can't 
 see it very well.The Post Office is   
 older than the Corner shop and was    
 built in 1800,  so is nearly 200      
 years old.                            </content>
