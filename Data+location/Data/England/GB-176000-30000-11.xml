		<title>11A POEM ABOUT TOURISM</title>
		<content> The children were invited to write a  
 poem about tourism.Here is what one   
 boy wrote:                            
                                       
 The people who come here              
 Are normaly friendly                  
 They drive on the road                
 Oh so bendy                           
 Its nice to help them                 
 Find their way around                 
 But they might be in an aeroplane     
 Above the ground                      
 They're in the town                   
 They're in the street                 
 They're in the  butchers              
 Buying meat.                          
 They drive you really barmy           
 It's like a massive army              
 The summer's gone                     
 They have gone away                   
 I think  I'll miss them               
 At least another day.  {Ben Peters    </content>
