		<title>09Housing in Colwall</title>
		<content>  According to the Domesday Book,      
 Colwall (or Colewelle as it was then  
 called) was a manor owned by the      
 Bishop of Hereford. It seems to have  
 been a well-ordered community, with   
 no waste-land, a comfortable amount of
 meadow land, and enough arable land   
 for 12 ploughs. The oldest houses in  
 the village now are farm houses and   
 timber-framed. Much of the farmland in
 the village has been built over with  
 modern development. Colwall is now    
 regarded as a very desirable place to 
 live. It has a population in excess of
 2000, many of them commuting to work  
 in Worcester, Malvern and the West    
 Midlands. In addition many retired    
 people have come here and the value of
 property has become such that young   
 married people cannot afford to buy   
 houses here. This has created a social
 imbalance in the  life of the village.</content>
