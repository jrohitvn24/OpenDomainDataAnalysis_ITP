		<title>11FISHBURN INDUSTRIAL ESTATE.</title>
		<content> A NEW ESTATE THAT IS BEING DEVELOPED. 
 THE COUNCIL ARE USING THE WASTE LAND  
 WHERE THE NOW-CLOSED FISHBURN COLLIERY
 WAS.FIRST OF ALL SOME OF THE COLLIERY 
 BUILDINGS WERE USED.THE PIT HEAD BATHS
 BECAME A CLOTHING FACTORY. OTHER      
 BUILDINGS ARE USED BY THE LOCAL BRASS 
 BAND AND THE ST.JOHN AMBULANCE        
 BRIGADE.LATELY THE SITE HAS BEEN      
 DEVELOPED FURTHER.2 NEW FACTORIES ARE 
 BEING BUILT BUT NO ONE IS USING THEM  
 YET.THERE IS ENOUGH SPACE FOR MORE    
 FACTORIES TO BE BUILT.A NEW ROAD IS   
 BEING MADE TO BE USED BY LORRIES AND  
 FACTORY WORKERS CARS.NEXT TO THE      
 COLLIERY IS THE PIT HEAP.IT IS BEING  
 FLATTENED.TREES WILL BE PLANTED AND IT
 WILL BE TURNED INTO FIELDS AND A      
 NATURE TRAIL.SIMILAR DEVELOPMENT IS   
 HAPPENING IN MANY PIT VILLAGES AND IS 
 HELPING TO MAKE NEW JOBS WHERE THERE  
 IS A LOT OF UNEMPLOYMENT.             </content>
