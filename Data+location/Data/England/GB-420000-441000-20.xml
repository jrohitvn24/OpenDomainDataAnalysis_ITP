		<title>20BMX IN YEADON</title>
		<content> There is only one BMX track in Yeadon,
 and it is owned by the{Dambusters     
{Club}It is called that because it is  
 built next to Yeadon Dam.About 20     
 riders practise every day,except      
 Friday and Saturday when racing takes 
 place.Spectators can watch free any   
 time.{Andrew Lister}in our class won a
 medal for coming fifth in a race.     
 There is a BMX shop in Yeadon called  
 Melanie Vauvelles Ultra BMX.You can   
 get all the bikes,spares and clothing 
 there. The{British Champion,Andy      
{Ruffel,}came there to present club    
 trophies this year.Our bikes are      
 Raleigh Burners;one is blue and yellow
 and the other is gold and black.We    
 go on the Whoops the Speed Jumps and  
 the Table Top.The Whoops are two bumps
 that you jump over and the Speed Jump 
 is one bump.The Table Top is a hill.
