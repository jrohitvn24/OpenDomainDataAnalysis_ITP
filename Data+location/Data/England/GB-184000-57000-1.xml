		<content> The area is{totally agricultural},with
 the majority of the farming being     
 dairy,although there has been a recent
 move towards more grain growing -oil  
 seed rape being the latest innovation.
 Some farms belong to the Duchy,which  
 means they are quite small as are the 
 rest of the farms in this area.       
  People live in{small villages }      
 (largest Kestle Mill).The houses are  
 old with little modern development.   
  As in much of Cornwall the most      
 notable features are connected with   
 tourism.{Dairyland}is a working farm  
 and museum,while{Trerice Manor}(owned 
 by the National Trust) is a house of  
 historic significance.Both are open to
 the public.                           
  The area is largely{unspoilt}with    
 little evidence of pollution or the   
 effects of man other than small scale 
 farming.                              </content>
