		<title>16Morwenstow - Footpaths</title>
		<content> There are many footpaths in the area. 
 Some  are  maintained  by  the  parish
 council, a few  are  tracks,  but most
 are very  overgrown  and  difficult to
 find.                                 
 Many footpaths  lead  to  the  church,
 others join together farms and hamlets
 The scene changes very  quickly as the
 path  first  crosses open  fields then
 dips  down into  steep wooded  valleys
 full of  flowers.  Marshy land covered
 in ragged robin, orchids and other bog
 plants  contains  deep  muddy holes to
 trap the  unwary, the  haunts of newts
 and frogs. St. David's  lane, a fairly
 direct path from  Shop to Kilkhampton,
 may date from Roman times.            
 One of the most difficult stretches of
 the   South  West  Coastal  path  runs
 through Morwenstow. These  paths yield
 bounteous signs  of  usage  by  former
 generations.                          </content>
