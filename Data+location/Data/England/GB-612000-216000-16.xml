		<title>16LAMB FARM</title>
		<content> When we went to look at Lamb Farm we  
 discovered that it did not have any   
 sheep or lambs as the name suggested. 
 Lamb Farm had got rid of all its      
 livestock in 1978.Even by then the    
 only animals there were cows and      
 goats. Now the farm has four tractors,
 a combine harvester, a forklift truck 
 and other farm machinery. The farm    
 itself includes four tied cottages,   
 none of which are lived in. The       
 average pay of the farm workers is    
 Â£82.00 if they are unqualified, but if
 qualified this goes up to Â£98.00. The 
 working day begins at 7.45am. and     
 finishes at 4.30pm. The farm is 350   
 acres in size and the land itself is  
 worth Â£700,000. Crops grown include   
 barley,for malting,wheat, sugar beet, 
 potatoes, and peas. Lamb Farm is an   
 arable farm.
