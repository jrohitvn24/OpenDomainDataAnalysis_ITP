		<content> In our survey area there are several  
 annual events which attract a good    
 turn_out of local people.  The{South  
{Wingfield Carnival}held in July on the
 village school's field has such       
 attractions as bands, a Punch and Judy
 show, displays and stalls.            
 In September the{Horticultural Show   
 takes place at which the local        
 gardeners display their fruit, flowers
 and vegetables.                       
 In October the parish church has a    
{Harvest Festival}which is always well 
 attended. The church is decorated with
 fruits of the land.                   
 A large{'Bonfire' Party}is held on 5th
 November at Wingfield Hall.  Potatoes 
 are baked in the fire and a firework  
 display takes place.
