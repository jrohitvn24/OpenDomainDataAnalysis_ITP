		<content> On Monday May 6 we had a Fun-day. It  
 started with a parade of decorated    
 floats and fancy_dress which went from
 Cross Lanes down to the car park.There
 were stalls on the beach. When the    
 tide was in there was a raft race.    
 Other activities included a cycle race
 and the army assault course. There was
 a Funfair which was on all day        
 including two thrilling rides, the    
 fast rotating Soul Shifter, and the   
 Dodgems. Later, there was an, "It's a 
 Knock-out," competition with hazards  
 like balancing buckets of water on    
 poles and tipping them into drums.On  
 the beach there was a Punch and Judy  
 show.By the Scawfell Hotel there was  
 an entertaining B.M.X.freestyle       
 competition.Next there was a roller   
 skating race,then an exciting pram    
 race.
