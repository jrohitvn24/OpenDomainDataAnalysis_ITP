		<title>15Plains Farm Estate</title>
		<content>{ Plains Farm Estate}was built in      
 1938_1939. A temporary school, locally
 known as{'The Huts',}was erected in   
 1940. This stood until 1977 when new  
 buildings were erected. The old school
 in the forties housed many activities.
 Among these were the local community  
 centre and boys club. The Catholic    
 Church also held Sunday services in   
 the school and even today{no church}of
 any denomination exists on the estate.
  For such a large estate facilities   
 such as shops etc. are very poor. It  
 was not until 1978 that a house in the
 middle of the estate was converted    
 into a general dealers, saving some   
 residents a long walk.                
  In 1967 a{working man's club}was     
 built on a site near the end of       
 Premier Road and has become an        
 integral part of the community.
