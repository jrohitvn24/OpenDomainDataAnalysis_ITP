		<title>20Changes in Cheshunt</title>
		<content>     There have been many changes in   
 our area over the past few years.The  
 whole area is close to London and is  
 inside the commuter belt.This means   
 that people working in London can     
 live in pleasant,country surroundings 
 within easy reach of their work.      
{Cheshunt                              
     Cheshunt has recently had a big   
 new Tescos Hypermarket built which has
 led to the building of new houses and 
 flats in the area.                    
{Goffs Oak                             
{   }The area around Goffs Oak is more 
 in the country and the changes have   
 taken place more slowly.Fifty years   
 ago Goffs Oak was a very small village
 with only a few large houses.Today it 
 is more like a small town with many   
 more houses and its own small         
 shopping centre.
