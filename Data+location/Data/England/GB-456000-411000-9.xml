		<title>09        COMPUTERS</title>
		<content> In{Askern}the most popular computer   
 was the{Spectrum.}Out of nine people, 
 four people had a{Spectrum,}but only  
 one out of the four people used his   
 computer for work. However he said he 
 did not depend on it. The other three 
 used their computers for leisure      
 uses. The other five were all         
 different computers. One which was    
 called the{Epsem}was used for work and
 the people who worked on it depended  
 on it. The other four were{Commodore  
{64, Acorn, Commodore, Vic 20}and the {
{Amstrad. }The{Amstrad}was used for    
 work and leisure. We found that most  
 computers are used for leisure, but   
 some are used for work. Out of the    
 three that are used for work only one 
 was depended on and that was the {    
{Chemist's}shop.
