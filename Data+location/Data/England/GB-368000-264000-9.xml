		<content> The parish church of St. Mary is the  
 only place of worship for the village 
 of Stanford.There was once a Chapel of
 Ease in Orleton. For members of       
 denominations other than Church of    
 England, there are Roman Catholic     
 churches in Tenbury and Stourport,and 
 nonconformist chapels in Tenbury all  
 about 10 miles away.{St.Mary's church 
 is in the united parish of the North  
 Teme,consisting of Lindridge,Knighton 
 Stockton,Stanford and Pensax. Each    
 community has its own church. Services
 are held on alternate Sundays. The    
 number of Stanford residents on the   
 Municipal Election list is 104 and    
 there are 31 members on the Church    
 Electoral Roll. Most villagers support
 the church whether they attend local  
 services or not. Social events        
 organised to help maintain the        
 buildings are always well attended.   </content>
