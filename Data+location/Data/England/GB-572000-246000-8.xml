		<content> This area of Suffolk is often referred
to as the "Prairies of East Anglia".   
Since the second World War ended in    
1944 there has been a gradual removal  
of the hedgerows by the farmers to     
enlarge the field units to make them   
easier to farm.  This has required high
mechanisation and low labour force.    
The price the area has had to pay is a 
rather monotonous vista of cereal and  
rape crops. A number of farmers are    
planting trees as wind breaks to stop  
soil erosion  and snow drifting in the 
winter which has frequently caused     
Hundon to be cut off - sometimes for   
days.                                  
 Weed and pest control has been taken  
over by aerial spraying using light    
aircraft. One farmer in the centre of  
Hundon at Street Farm (David Claydon)  
has 3 aircraft at the rear of his farm 
with a grass landing strip.            </content>
