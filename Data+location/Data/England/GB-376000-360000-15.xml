		<title>15CHANGING TIMES IN SANDBACH</title>
		<content> WE INTERVIEWED SEVERAL PEOPLE FROM OUR
 BLOCK WHO HAVE LIVED HERE MOST OF     
 THEIR LIVES AND ASKED THEM FOR THEIR{ 
{ATTITUDES}TO THE CHANGES THAT HAVE    
 TAKEN PLACE. PEOPLE SEEM TO MISS THE  
 OLD CINEMA AND NOTICED HOW MUCH THE { 
{TRAFFIC}HAS INCREASED IN NOISE AND    
 SIZE. THERE USED TO BE MANY MORE      
 DANCING FACILITIES AND PEOPLE WERE    
 MUCH FRIENDLIER. THE SCHOOLS ARE MUCH 
 LESS STRICT AND THERE USED TO BE A    
 DECENT CAFE IN THE CENTRE. ONE PERSON 
 REMEMBERED THE OLD SUNDAY SCHOOL      
 TRIPS. SHE ALSO GAVE US A BRIEF       
 DESCRIPTION OF THE{SECOND WORLD WAR}  
 AND HOW SHE USED TO MAKE AMMUNITION   
 AND SHE REMEMBERED THE FOOD RATIONING.
 THE NEAREST{CINEMA}IS LOCATED IN      
 HANLEY. THERE USED TO BE ONE IN CREWE 
 BUT LIKE MOST CINEMAS IT HAS CLOSED   
 DOWN.                                 
                                       </content>
