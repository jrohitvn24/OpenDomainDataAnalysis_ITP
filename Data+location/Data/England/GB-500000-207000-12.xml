		<title>12POTTEN END-THE GREEN II.</title>
		<content> WITHIN THE VILLAGE GREEN IS A POND    
 WHICH UP UNTIL THE MID 1960'S,WAS A   
 VERY GOOD FISHING PLACE FOR ANGLERS.  
 THE MAIN SPECIES WITHIN THE POND WERE 
 RUDD AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF NEWTS.    
 DURING THIS PERIOD THE POND BECAME    
 POLLUTED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS,BECAUSE
 IT IS A STILL POND AND THEREFORE THE  
 SUPPLY OF WATER IS THE RAIN AND THERE 
 IS NO FLOW OF WATER TO CLEAN THE POND.
                                       
 OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS POLLUTION      
 OCCURED BECAUSE PEOPLE NOT EDUCATED IN
 THE WAY OF THE COUNTRYSIDE BEGAN TO   
 DUMP ALL FORMS OF RUBBISH INTO THE    
 POND,FOR EXAMPLE HOUSEHOLD RUBBISH.   
                                       
 THE POND IS CLEARED BY FIREMEN NOW,   
 BY PUMPING THE DIRTY WATER OUT OF THE 
 POND AND REPLACING IT WITH CLEAN WATER
 ONCE IT IS EMPTY.
