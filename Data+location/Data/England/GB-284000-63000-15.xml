		<title>15Marldons Ring Road</title>
		<content> In Marldon there was going to be a new
 ring road. We went and asked some     
 local people what they thought of the 
 idea. We asked, "Do you agree with the
 new ring road?" 11 said "No",2        
 said "Yes".                           
 "Do you agree with the cost?" 10      
 said "No." 3 said, "Yes."             
 "Do you think it will help with       
 businesses in Marldon?" 12 said "No". 
 1 said "Yes."                         
 "If you go to work do you think it    
 will help?" 9 said "No". 3 said,"Yes."
 "Do you think it will ruin our        
 countryside too much?" 2 said "No" and
 11 said, "Yes".                       
 "Do you think it will prevent the     
 accidents we have each year." 6 said  
 "No." 7 said, "Yes".                  
 "Do you think it will make us a part  
 of Torbay?" 13 said, "No" and none    
 said, "Yes".                          </content>
