		<content> Of the people that replied to our     
 questionnaire 34% work locally in     
 farming, 23% work from home either as 
 artists or printers or woodcarvers,   
 23% are retired, 10% commute          
 to Cheltenham, Gloucester or even     
 London and 10% are unemployed.        
 THere used to be many more people     
 working on the farms but mechanisation
 has meant that a fairly large farm can
 now be run by just two people rather  
 than the 15 to 20 that used to work   
 the land.                             
 The largest employer is the Cotswold  
 Farm Park, but most of their employees
 only work on a seasonable basis.      
 Several people drive lorries and the  
 local pub also employs several people 
 on a part-time basis.                 
 The school employs 6 people.
