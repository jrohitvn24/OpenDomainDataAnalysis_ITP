		<title>19A SCHOOLBOY'S DAY,HIGH HAM</title>
		<content> My name is Ben, I am 8 years old and I
 go to High Ham Primary School. I get  
 up at 7.00am. Then I have cereal and  
 toast for breakfast. At 8.30am I go to
 school. I play with my friends,usually
 football, before school begins at     
 9.00am. I work in class doing maths &amp; 
 English until break time at 10.30am.  
 After break at 11.00am I do more work,
 sometimes writing stories,or drama,or 
 painting. Lunch is at 12.15pm. I have 
 a school dinner cooked in the school  
 kitchen. Afternoon school begins at   
 1.30pm and ends at 3.30pm. In the     
 afternoons we do art and crafts, or   
 sport and have a story-time. After    
 school I usually stay for a club such 
 as swimming, cricket, football or     
 athletics. When I go home I have tea  
 of sandwiches, biscuits &amp; fruit. Then 
 I watch television and do my homework 
 before bath- and bedtime at 8.00pm.   </content>
