		<content>      {WINKLE STREET }(meaning a       
 cul-de-sac) is composed of a row of   
 well preserved 17th century cottages, 
 mostly of stone and many still        
 thatched.  Originally built for       
 Westover tenants they were            
 afterwards owned by the Barrington    
 Simeons when Winkle Street became     
 Barrington Row, but the old name is   
 generally more often used.  They are  
 now mainly privately owned and well   
 modernised.                           
       The 18th century stone built{   
{NEWBARN}to the east of the village is 
 occupied by the Spence family as      
 a working farm. Though modernised it  
 still retains original features such  
 as doorways and windows.              
       The old{SCHOOL and SCHOOLHOUSE} 
 was built in the 19th century as a    
 church school. Closed when the numbers
 fell in the 1950s it is now two homes.</content>
