		<content> We did a survey of the children in our
 school to see what were their parents'
 favourite pastimes and hobbies.       
 There are no real sports facilities in
 our block,but the area is very        
 suitable for walking,bird watching and
 nature watching. These activities     
 proved to be very popular among the   
 grown-ups. Another popular pastime was
 gerdening,which we found surprising as
 some grown-ups complain about it!     
 Those grown-ups interested in Sport,  
 mainly golf,tennis,badminton and      
 squash,have to travel into different  
 areas to play. These are not very far 
 away,between two and five miles.      
 Children's pastimes include Brownies, 
 Cubs,ballet,BMX,roller                
 skating,football and swimming.About   
 half of these activities can be done  
 in the village of Uley.
