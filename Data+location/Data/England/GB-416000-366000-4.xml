		<content> WE HAVE NO DOCTOR'S SURGERY OR        
 HOSPITAL AND NEED TO TRAVEL TO        
 BAKEWELL, BUXTON OR CHESTERFIELD FOR  
 THESE SERVICES.                       
 PEOPLE ARE NOTED FOR LIVING A LONG    
 LIFE UP HERE, EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE A   
 FAIRLY SEVERE CLIMATE DUE TO THE      
 ALTITUDE OF OVER 300 METRES ABOVE SEA 
 LEVEL.WE ARE ALSO ON THE EDGE OF A    
 PLATEAU.                              
 THERE HAVE BEEN 3 DEATHS THIS YEAR BUT
 ALL WERE OLDER PEOPLE IN THEIR LATE   
 70'S AND 80'S. LAST YEAR OUR OLDEST   
 INHABITANT DIED AGED 91 YEARS.        
 A MOBILE PHYSIOTHERAPY UNIT DOES COME 
 TO THE VILLAGE FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT.
