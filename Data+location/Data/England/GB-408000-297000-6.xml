		<content> Remains of a Roman Road can be seen in
 Sutton Park and a road in an exclusive
 housing area is named Roman Road. The 
 region is closely associated with the 
 general history of Sutton Coldfield,  
 which was part of the Kingdom of      
 Mercia and was mentioned in the       
 Domesday Book of 1086. The area was   
 inhabited by the charcoal burners of  
 earlier times. The town was granted a 
 charter of incorporation by Henry Vlll
 in 1528,mostly at the instigation of  
 Bishop Vesey. A new charter was       
 granted by Charles ll in 1664.        
 In 1871 a railway was built from      
 Sutton to Walsall. This ran through   
 Sutton Park,much to the anger of local
 residents.The line was axed in        
 the 1960's. Much urban development has
 taken place especially since 1960 and 
 this has increased since incorporation
 with Birmingham in 1974.              </content>
