      P.C.Lloyd works eight hours per  
 day.  Evenings are the busiest because
 that is when the accidents happen as  
 the people come and go from work.  He 
 is a community policeman who deals    
 with theft, damage, burglaries,       
 traffic offences and accidents.       
 P.C.Lloyd covers the area of          
 Swineshead, Melchbourne, Knotting,    
 Upper Dean, Lower Dean, Thurleigh and 
 Riseley.  He visits the schools       
 because he likes to keep in touch with
 the children.  He talks to them about 
 such things as road safety.  His      
 station is Greyfriars in Bedford.  He 
 rides around on a motorbike or a      
 push-bike. You are not allowed to have
 another job if you are a Policeman.   
 He likes his job because he can talk  
 to people.
