		<title>12LOCAL HISTORY</title>
		<content> This is an area, sparsely occupied    
 now, whose roots go far back into     
 time.  At Harlyn in 1900 AD. was re-  
 vealed an Iron Age burial ground of   
 approx. 130 graves, with many skelet_ 
 ons in crouched position.  Brooches   
 and other grave goods are now in the  
 R.I. of Cornwall Museum at Truro  -   
 as are Bronze Age relics from Harlyn  
 Farm.                                 
 Countless ships have become wrecks in 
 the area around Trevose Head.  Two may
 still be seen.  At Harlyn Bay, by the 
 stream bridge, lie the remains of 'The
 Industry', a wooden brigantine.  At   
 Booby's Bay, the keel, frames, part   
 decking, funnel, capstan, anchor, etc.
 of the 20,000 ton steel vessel 'Carl' 
 of Hamburg, still lie.  During the    
 winter of l985, what remains of this  
 ship were uncovered by the sea, but   
 most now lies beneath the sand.       </content>
