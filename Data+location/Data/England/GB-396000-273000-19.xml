 We surveyed a selection of 26 pupils  
 from Lickey First and Middle          
 School. Here are the results:         
 14 people had a video,                
 9 people had a teletext,              
 25 people had a telephone,            
 26 had a radio,television and         
 newspaper and                         
 21 had their paper delivered.         
{SURVEY NO.2: ADULTS                   
 We also conducted a survey in the     
 street.We interviewed 10 people.5 were
 OAP's and 5 were people below the age 
 of 50.These were the results:         
 10 had a radio,television,newspaper   
 and telephone.                        
 Only those below 50 had a video       
 and teletext.                         
 The older people seem not to have     
 a need for this modern technology.
