		<content> The cricket pavilion used to be an old
 cow shed but there is now a new one.  
 The cricket field is part of the      
 Community Field next to the primary   
 school playing field.The captain of   
 the club is Simon Powell.The players  
 come from the villages around Old     
 Dalby.The matches are played against  
 other villages.At the end of the      
 season they always play Central       
 Television.The teas are made by the   
 wives of the cricketers.They are      
 usually cobs filled with salad,       
 sandwiches with cheese or chicken,    
 and cakes.The teams also have a drink.
