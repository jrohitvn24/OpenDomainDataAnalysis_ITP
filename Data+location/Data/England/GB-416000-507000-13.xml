		<title>13MELSONBY-The Village Shop</title>
		<content>  Only{one shop}remains in the village,
 following the closure  last year  of a
 general dealers.  Although small, this
 corner shop{caters for most needs}from
 the point of view of food   (fresh and
 frozen),   newspapers  and  magazines,
 drink   (alcohol  and  others),   and 
 incorporates all{post office services.
  It  is  thus  an{ important  village 
{amenity} which  must not be allowed to
 disappear  in the  same  way  that the
 vicarage, police house, schoolmaster's
 house and other shops have disappeared
 over the past 30/40  years.           
  The  shop  is {open  7 days  a  week,
 although  with {restricted  hours  of 
{opening}on{Sunday and Thursday.}      
  Prices may be slightly higher than in
 the town supermarkets but the costs of
 transport to/from town cancels out any
 savings  made on  price.  The personal
 service &amp; convenience count much more.</content>
