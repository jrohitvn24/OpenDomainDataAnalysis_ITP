   Land in this area is mainly used for
arable farming. The crops include      
winter wheat, spring wheat, barley,    
oil-seed rape, peas, potatoes, beans,  
and a small amount of permanent        
pasture.                               
   The soil is fertile boulder clay    
and the relief slightly undulating.    
Livestock are very limited consisting  
of a few cows, pigs and chickens.      
   All farms have a least one tractor  
and maybe a combine harvester, but     
contractors are quite often used for   
this purpose as hiring can often be    
less expensive.                        
   Due to the use of machinery little  
labour is used, farms genarally employ 
about two permanent workers.           
   The farming is very{intensive}.
