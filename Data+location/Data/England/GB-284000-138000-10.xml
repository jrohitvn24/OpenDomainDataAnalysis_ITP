		<title>10The Golden Horseshoe,Exford</title>
		<content> The Golden Horseshoe is a long        
 distance ride which starts at Exford  
 every year,in May. The horses and     
 riders arrive on the Monday so that   
 they can be inspected by the Vet. On  
 Tuesday the competitors do a 50mile   
 ride over Exmoor. Their average speed 
 must be 8m.p.h. From the playground we
 saw them coming back,this year two of 
 the children made a tally count,on    
 colour of horses and number of riders.
 Some of the horses were lame,they were
 all sweating. On Wednesday they do the
 25mile ride in the other direction.   
 The Prizegiving takes place in the    
 Auction field,in the afternoon. Any   
 rider with no penalties is given a    
 golden horseshoe.There are also Silver
 and Bronze awards and rosettes.On     
 Thursday Exford is all Quiet again.
