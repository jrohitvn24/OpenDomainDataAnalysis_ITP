 AREA IS MAINLY POPULAR FOR HIKERS,    
 WALKERS etc.                          
  THE MAIN ATTRACTION APART FROM THE   
 BEAUTIFUL SCENERY OF FIELDS AND TREES 
 ARE THE OLD LEAD MINES KNOWN AS MAGPIE
 MINE THIS IS OF GREAT HISTORICAL      
 INTEREST AND THE MAGNIFICENT CHURCH IN
 SHELDON VILLAGE.                      
  OCCASIONALLY PEOPLE PASS THROUGH     
 SHELDON IN CARS OR ON BICYCLES JUST   
 OUT OF CURIOSITY.
