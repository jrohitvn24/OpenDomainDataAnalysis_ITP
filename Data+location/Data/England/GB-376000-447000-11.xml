		<title>11History-Bolton by Bowland</title>
		<content>                                       
  The chief landmark of this area is   
 the{church}of St. Peter and St. Paul  
 in Bolton by Bowland which was in     
 existence in 1190AD.The present       
 building ,which has been altered and  
 added to many times,is said to have   
 had its tower designed by{Henry VI    
 who sheltered at Bolton Hall after    
 the Battle of Hexam,and discovered a  
 well there,which can still be seen.In 
 the church there is the{tomb of Sir   
{Ralph Pudsay}shown as a crusader with 
 his 3 wives and 25 children.Bolton    
 Hall itself was pulled down 30 years  
 ago but the stables and cottages      
 remain.                               
 There is a place on the River Ribble  
 called{Pudsay's Leap}where another    
 Pudsay,who was minting his own silver,
 is said to have leapt the river to    
 escape from the King's men.           </content>
