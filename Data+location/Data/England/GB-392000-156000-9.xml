		<content> Many residents have their own trans-  
 port, some families having two cars,  
 so the public bus service has reduced 
 to 2 return journeys daily which      
 pass through Keevil and Bulkington    
 to Devizes and Trowbridge. Coaches    
 take students to the College and      
 Clarendon School,Trowbridge and from  
 Bulkington to Keevil School. Nearest  
 railway stations are at Trowbridge    
 and Westbury. 190 Keevil residents    
 signed a petition in protest against  
 the introduction of a double decker   
 bus to replace 2 existing single      
 decker services. Objection was on     
 aesthetic and safety grounds, but this
 was overruled at a County Council     
 meeting in April 1985. Application was
 made in Oct.85 to Tesco Stores for the
 inclusion of Keevil on their free     
 shopping bus service to Trowbridge.   
 A mobile library serves the villages. </content>
