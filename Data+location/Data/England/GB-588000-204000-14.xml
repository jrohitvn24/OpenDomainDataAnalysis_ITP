		<title>14 BUILDINGS ON OSEA ISLAND.</title>
		<content> There are 14 houses on the island.Two 
 are C17th,nine are early C20th and the
 remainder were built between 1916 and 
 1926.At one time they were used to    
 house Alcoholics whom Mr. Carrington  
 hoped to wean off drink. The scheme   
 was not a total success as some of the
 inmates managed to arrange secret     
 deliveries by boat.                   
   During the First World War the Navy 
 took over the island and several of   
 the buildings go back to that time. A 
 former ammunition shed is now a       
 grainstore; an old Nissan hut is now  
 a boatshed; the old Generating House  
 is now a workshop and the old         
 gymnasium is a shed. The Navy also    
 left behind a Chapel but noone would  
 now recognise it as such. A more      
 recent farm building is the grainstore
 built in the 1960's.
