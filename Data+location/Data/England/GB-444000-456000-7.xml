 When we went to Whixley and to the    
 church the vicar told us a story about
 a man called Chistopher Tancred.This  
 is it: Chistopher Tancred lived in the
 house behind the church.Chistopher    
 Tancreds family were the heads of the 
 village.In Christopher's will he left 
 alot of money to the community but he 
 said instead of being buried under-   
 ground he wanted to be put in a tomb  
 in his house.So when he died he was.  
 When the house was sold the people who
 bought it didn't like the idea of hav-
 ing a tomb in their house so it was   
 moved to the church.Every night he is 
 said to get out of his tomb,go through
 a door in the church,then through a   
 hole in the wall near the church and  
 go back to his home and haunt it.
