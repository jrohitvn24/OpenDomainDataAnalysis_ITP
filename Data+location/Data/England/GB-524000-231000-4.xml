		<content>    The area between Clothall and      
 Baldock is mainly arable land. The    
 soil profiles are principally         
 rendzinas, but to the S.E. of Clothall
 there are brown earths, developed on  
 chalky boulder clays with flints.     
    The land is owned by large farms   
 situated in Weston and along the A507 
 and is classified as Grades 1 and 2.  
 The principle crops are wheat, barley,
 and oilseed rape, with some fields of 
 broad beans adjacent to Clothall. The 
 few grazing fields are small, spread  
 out, and located on land which is too 
 difficult to cultivate. The arable    
 fields are large with few hedges,     
 woods, or copses. The cattle are      
 mainly beef breed Charolais Hereford  
 cross.
