		<content> History has left few famous marks on  
 the Parish of{Buckland Tout Saints.}  
 It is a quiet part of the{South Hams} 
 with two hamlets,a small Post Office, 
 and an Hotel.A former manor house is  
 now a Centre for Outdoor Activities   
 and there is a small Caravan Site at  
 its western edge.What was the main    
 Turnpike road connecting Kingsbridge  
 and Totnes winds through it passing   
 the many farms.Most people pass       
 through it without stopping unless    
 they happen to be a 'local'.          
    Unnoticed as it is though,it has a 
 history all of its own that tells of  
 the lives,successes and tradgedies of 
 how people lived in the past.
