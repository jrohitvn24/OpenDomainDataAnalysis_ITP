		<title>08Transport in West Ashby.</title>
		<content> Public transport is very limited      
 through the Village,there being only  
 two bus services  a week. The hourly  
 bus service to Horncastle and Louth of
 the 1930's has gone.Today there is    
 only the Horncstle Bus Club operating 
 between the two towns on Wednesdays.  
 The bus leaves Horncastle at 9.30a.m. 
 arriving in Louth at 10.30a.m. returns
 from Louth at 13.30hrs arriving in    
 Horncastle at 14.30hrs.This service is
 little used by villagers.Thursday is  
 Market day in Horncastle and a local  
 bus company runs a service around     
 several villages. This service picks  
 up in the village at 10.45a.m. and    
 returns at 12.30a.m.this is used      
 regularly by 10/12 villagers who rely 
 on it a great deal.Children under 11  
 are transported to school in          
 Horncastle by bus.Over 11 they have to
 make their own way.                   </content>
