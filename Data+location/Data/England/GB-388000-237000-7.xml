		<content> Lying four miles north of Tewkesbury  
 on A38. Convenient to M50, offering   
 breakfast and lunches to about 1000   
 lorry drivers a week. Recently rebuilt
 by family who run it. Owner builder   
 pigeon fancier. Well known as a       
 good refreshment stop attracting many 
 tourists in Summer when commercial    
 users decrease. Busiest time possibly 
 winter months when more substantial   
 fayre is consumed. The cafe is open   
 from 6 a.m. to 4 p.m. each weekdays   
 and 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. Saturday. Ample 
 parking space being sited between two 
 lay-bys.
