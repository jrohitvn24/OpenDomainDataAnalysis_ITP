		<content> My name is Darren.I live at 8 0riole  
 Way Heron Park Gloucester.My house is 
 semi-detached and my favourite room is
 my bedroom because I have my toys and 
 books there and I sleep in it.My      
 second favourite is the living room.  
 Our front door is brown with windows  
 in it and a golden knocker.My family  
 are Mummy,Daddy and my two sisters.My 
 sisters are older than me and go to a 
 different school.Mummy sometimes comes
 to school to help.I have a light over 
 my bed so that I can read my books.   
 Daddy has made me some cupboards with 
 red handles.I have aeroplanes on my   
 wallpaper and model aeroplanes hanging
 from the ceiling and they look as     
 though they are flying.We have a      
 telephone and we have plants under the
 telephone.We have a pretend fire that 
 glows yellow.                         
                                       </content>
