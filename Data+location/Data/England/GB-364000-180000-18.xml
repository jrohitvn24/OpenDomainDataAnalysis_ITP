		<title>18Chestnut Farm. Coalpit Heath</title>
		<content> Chestnut farm is owned by Mr. Poole.  
 Mr. Poole has been farming here for 38
 years. Chestnut farm is very big      
 in fact it is 250 acres. It is a hard 
 job to manage so large a farm with    
 only his son and one other man to help
 him. The farm has a hundred cows and  
 as many calves making two hundred head
 of cattle in all. They have a milking 
 parlour and produce about 260 gallons 
 of milk each day. The cows are milked 
 at 6.00am and 4.00pm. When the cows   
 are about 2\ years old they are ready 
 to have a calf and after this they can
 be milked. Mr. Poole has one bull     
 called Superstar on his farm.         
 They also grow crops on Chestnut farm.
 They grow wheat, barley and corn.     
 About one third of the farm is given  
 over to this purpose whilst the       
 remainder is used for the livestock.
