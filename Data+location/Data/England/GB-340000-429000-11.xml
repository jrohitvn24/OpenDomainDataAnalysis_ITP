		<title>11CHILDS ATTITUDES TO CLUB DAY</title>
		<content>This year I was chosen to be Bower     
Carrier with the Rose Queen (Rachel    
Hull)I was chosen as I was one of those
who attended the C of E Sunday School  
the most.My dress contrasted with the  
Rose Queens,it was a white flowery     
material with matching gloves,headress 
and velvet belt.The Bower was a wooden 
structure,painted white with four poles
for us to hold.It was beautifully      
decorated with paper flowers and gold  
lettering which said-                  
HOLY TRINITY ROSE QUEEN and the Rose   
Queen walked in the middle of it with  
her trainbearers holding no-tugging,at 
her cape.Whilst walking we were told   
endlessly by nagging Rachel to"keep    
that stupid Bower straight"Honestly she
didn't know how much the flippin' Bower
weighed!"
