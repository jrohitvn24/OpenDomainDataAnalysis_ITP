		<title>11Master Johns Farmhouse</title>
		<content>    Master Johns is typical of many of 
 the farmhouses in the area which are  
 now just ordinary homes. Often they   
 are bought by professional people who 
 spend a lot of time renovating the    
 properties. When we arrived we saw    
 ducks, ducklings, geese, hens, dogs   
 and cats all wandering freely around  
 the house and barns, which are in     
 about one acre of land.               
    The house was originally built in  
 the 14th century, but little of that  
 remains. Most of the house was rebuilt
 in the 18th century with some         
 Victorian additions.                  
    There are workshops at the back of 
 the house, where wooden furniture is  
 made, such as chairs, desks, cabinets 
 and tables in mahogany, pine and      
 walnut. This sort of special work is  
 the only kind of industry in our area 
 apart from farming.                   </content>
