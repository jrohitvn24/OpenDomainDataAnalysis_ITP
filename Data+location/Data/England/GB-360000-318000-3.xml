		<title>03The Creamery: Crudgington</title>
		<content> The Dairy Crest creamery at           
 Crudgington is the major industrial   
 activity and employer in the block.   
 It employs just over 300 workers, with
 the actual number depending on the    
 seasonal variations in milk           
 production, (maximum April/May).      
 Milk is collected from 950 farmers by 
 bulk tanker lorries, each carrying 900
 litres.   The catchment area ranges   
 all over North Shropshire and parts of
 Staffordshire and Cheshire.   The main
 products are butter and skimmed milk  
 powder.   The former is exported as   
 far as malaysia, the Middle East and  
 the West Indies.   The latter is used 
 not for local animal feed, especially 
 pigs, but also exported, particularly 
 to the Third World; Algeria, Peru and 
 Mexico.   Peak handling capacity is   
 1.3 million litres per day.
