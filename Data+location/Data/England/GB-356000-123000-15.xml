 Centre situated in Queen Camel. There 
 are 3 doctors, 2 district nurses and a
 midwife, there is also a dispensary.  
 The doctors generally see about 45    
 patients each a day. The district     
 nurses give treatment in the Centre as
 well as covering a 10 mile radius to  
 nurse the sick in their homes.These   
 are mainly elderly patients who,      
 because of advances in drugs and      
 surgery, are now able to live longer  
 than in the past.                     
    Activities are provided at the     
 heatlh centre for both the elderly and
 the very young.The elderly have a     
 luncheon club and the young,a Mother  
 and toddler group.Adjacent to the
