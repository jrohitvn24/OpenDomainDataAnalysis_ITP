		<title>17ASHWELL SHOW ORGANISATION</title>
		<content> The Ashwell Show is organised by a    
 committee of local villagers, doctors,
 farmers and businessmen. They meet    
 about once a month throughout the     
 year. It is held on August Bank       
 Holiday Monday. It is such a large    
 show that over a hundred people are   
 needed to get the fields ready. It is 
 estimated that the attendance for the 
 past two years has been in the region 
 of 6 to 7,000 and the profit between  
 Â£5,500 and Â£6,000. The profits are    
 distributed as a result of the        
 decisions of the committee. All       
 organisations helping on the day      
 receive donations. The largest sums go
 to worthy causes in the area. Newnham 
 Church Restoratin Fund Â£1000, Village
