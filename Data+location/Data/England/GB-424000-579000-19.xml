		<content> Every year about 350 pupils have the  
 option of leaving Bedlingtonshire High
 School. The latest breakdown for this 
 figure is as follows; last year l00   
 pupils opted to return to school for  
 further study; l60 took up a place on 
 a government scheme, 45 found         
 full-time employment; 25 were         
 unemployed and 20 had either left the 
 area or were untraceable.  Teachers   
 felt that most of the children who    
 left school were genuinely looking for
 jobs. Pupils who stay on into the 6th 
 Form are advised to get as many       
 qualifications as possible.  Between  
 May l984 and May l985 there was an    
 increase in the number of unemployed  
 school leavers in the Northern Region.
