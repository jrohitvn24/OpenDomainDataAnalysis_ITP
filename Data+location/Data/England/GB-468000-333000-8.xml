		<content> Herbert Simpson started this firm with
 his three sons in the 1920's.         
 Herbert's grandson's Tom and Les now  
 run the business. It was a{bakery}and 
 a{corn merchants}originally but the   
 bakery closed down in the 1950's.     
   They buy corn from the local farms  
 and sell it to millers to produce     
 bread flour, biscuit flour and animal 
 feed. They use their 7 lorries to     
 deliver corn for export to Hull,      
 Liverpool, Boston and Gunness, and    
 bring back fertiliser, poultry food,  
 cow cake, dairy foods. Their annual   
 turnover is almost Â£6 million.        
    The area that they deliver to forms
 a rough circle linking Newark to      
 Grantham to Melton to Leicester to    
 Nottingham and back to Newark.        
   Their deliveries are made almost    
 entirely in bulk, using 15 ton        
 lorries. {Author:Paul Healing.        </content>
