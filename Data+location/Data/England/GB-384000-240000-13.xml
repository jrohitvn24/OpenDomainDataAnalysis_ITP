		<content>{Oak Apple day,}29th May, celebrates   
 the restoration of the monarchy, the  
 date on which Charles 11 landed back  
 in this country in 1660. Parliament   
 decreed that this date should be a    
 national holiday but this was repealed
 in 1830. In Upton this day was        
 celebrated by people wearing button   
 holes of Oak Apple leaves and dancing 
 in the streets.These celebrations had 
 ceased by the time of the second world
 war. In 1985 these celebrations were  
 resumed taking place on May 25th the  
 Saturday of the Spring Bank holiday   
 weekend. Wearing Oak Apple leaves     
 children from the Junior School danced
 first, followed by the adults who     
 ended their dance at the Memorial Hall
 where lunch was served.
