		<title>06HOUSE AND HOME</title>
		<content>      There are lots of different kinds
 of houses in Forest Town.There are the
 Avenues. The houses are quite big     
 inside but the things that are not so 
 good about them is the outside and the
 garden.The garden is not very big and 
 it backs into someone elses garden.   
 These do not cost so much.For someone 
 who likes a bit bigger house and      
 garden the Larkhills are ideal.The    
 Larkhills have three or four bedrooms 
 and have a large garden.The Oak Tree  
 Lane Estate is quite new.They have    
 three or four bedrooms and  nice      
 garden.                               
      In Forest Town there are schools 
 which take children from ages 3 to    
 18.There is one Catholic school in    
 Forest Town.
