		<title>02EDUCATION IN LINTON</title>
		<content>   The Infants School was founded in   
 1815 as a Sunday school.Until 1974    
 there was a mixed primary school.     
  When the village started to increase 
 its population a new primary school   
 was built on Linton Heights(230 pupils
 in 1985)                              
  There are approximately 205 pupils in
 the Infants School.The average in one 
 class is about 30 .                   
  The children work about 25 hours a   
 week.Each class goes on a trip a      
 couple of times a year.               
  We did a survey in Linton asking     
 people what they thought about        
 Education,and this is what we found.  
 People mostly think that there aren't 
 enough playgroups in Linton.The Linton
 Social Centre has a playgroup with    
 about 20 children per day.
