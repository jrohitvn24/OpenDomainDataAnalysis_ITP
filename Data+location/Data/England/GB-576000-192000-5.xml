		<title>05Traffic survey in Rawreth</title>
		<content> This survey was conducted on the new  
 A130 and a joining side road(oldA130).
 The traffic flow was counted at 8.00AM
 -8.30AM and then at 10.30AM-11.00AM.  
 The totals were:A130_8.00-8.30=917    
 vehicles,A130_10.30-11.00=975 vehicles
 side_8.00-8.30=62 vehicles,side_10.30-
 11.00=85 vehicles.Conclusions:1.A130  
 busier because wider/faster and leads 
 to A127,Chelmsford,London,Southend.   
 Ajoining road serves only Battles-    
 -bridge village.2.There were more cars
 than lorries and vans,1637 compared to
 402,because people probably go to work
 in cars.3.The busiest time was mid-   
 -morning:because there is no clear    
 rush hour,people may avoid what they  
 thought was the busiest time.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
