		<title>08Mining  Fullers  Earth</title>
		<content>   {Fullers Earth}has been dug in the  
 area for over 4OO years.The Fullers   
 Earth is found beneath red sand       
 strongly impregnated with iron,then,  
 beneath a thin stratum of clay is     
 found a purer stratum of Fullers      
 Earth.Products made using the Fullers 
 Earth include:animal feeds,           
 fertilisers,pet litter granules,seed  
 pelletisation,sodium-activated Fullers
 Earth for foundry use,plus many       
 others.It's original use was to clean 
 wool and cotton.The company           
 responsible for the digging makes good
 the land so that no unsightly scars   
 are left and many new trees have been 
 planted.                              
   We went to the quarry and were told 
 that they made cat litter and sold one
 third of it to Sweden.Water was being 
 drained off.Carol found a sea anemone.
