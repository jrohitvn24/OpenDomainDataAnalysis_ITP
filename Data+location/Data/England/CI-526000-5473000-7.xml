{COSTAL DEFENCES}                      
 Over the last few hundred years the   
 Channel Islands have come under attack
 on several occasions and so the       
 islanders had to build defences.      
                                       
                                       
 The early defences were mainly walls  
 and towers (wrongly named 'Martelo'   
 towers) which were built up around the
 coast of Guernsey.After the German    
 invasion in 1940,many more defences   
 were built.These included more        
 towers,bunkers and gun batteries.
