 The area surveyed is situated         
 approximately twelve miles north-west 
 of Salisbury on Salisbury Plain.The   
 area includes the village of Orcheston
 and the northern part of Shrewton.    
  The surrounding countryside is       
 farmland,a mixture of cultivated      
 crops,improved grassland and enclosed 
 rough grazing.The land also falls     
 within the Ministry of Defence firing 
 range boundary.                       
  There are numerous tracks and roads  
 dissecting the ranges, although access
 is limited because of the army        
 activities.                           
  There are a number of historical     
 features such as ancient burial       
 mounds and a Gibbet.
