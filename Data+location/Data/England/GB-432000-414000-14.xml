		<title>14Why live in South Wakefield</title>
		<content>   My family live on Pledwick Lane     
 which is a nice area. Our house is    
 detached with 3 bedrooms and a large  
 garden.  We moved here 6 years ago    
 when my father got a job in Wakefield.
   There is a lot of housing around    
 Wakefield but we chose this area      
 because there is plenty of open       
 countryside around here and it is nice
 and quiet.                            
   Although there are few shops in the 
 area the City Centre is only 3 miles  
 away and they opened a big Asda Super-
 market a mile away only last year.  It
 is easy to get to the City Centre     
 because plenty of buses run along the 
 main road.                            
   Getting to primary school could have
 been a problem but a special bus      
 picked us up.  Now I am at the        
 comprehensive school I can walk on    
 fine days or catch a bus.             </content>
