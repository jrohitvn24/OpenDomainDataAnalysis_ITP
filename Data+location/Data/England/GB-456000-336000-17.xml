		<title>17PLAY GROUND GAMES</title>
		<content>    These are some of the games we play
 in our play-ground at school : French 
 skipping, Blue bird, I sent a letter, 
 Mother may I, My red letter, Kissy    
 cat, The A-Team, Football, Netball,   
 Hide and seek, Snobs, Chips,          
 Television and Give us a clue.        
    My favourite of these is French    
 skipping. It is a skipping game using 
 a piece of elastic. Three people play,
 one person at each end with the       
 elastic round their ankles. You have  
 to jump in certain patterns over and  
 on to the elastic. When you have done 
 a whole rhyme, the elastic is moved up
 to knee level and then thigh level. If
 you get a bit wrong then you change   
 places with one of the people at the  
 end and they have a turn. My favourite
 rhyme is Jingle, Jangle.              
                                       
                                       </content>
