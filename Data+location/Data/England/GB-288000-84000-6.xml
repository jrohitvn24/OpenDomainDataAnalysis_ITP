		<content> MANY HOUSES IN THE VILLAGES ARE       
 BETWEEN 100 AND 300 YEARS OLD.THEY    
 WOULD HAVE BEEN BUILT WITH DEVON      
 COB,WITH RENDERED WALLS AND THATCHED  
 ROOFS.THERE IS LITTLE NEW BUILDING    
 ALLOWED BY THE PLANNING AUTHORITIES   
 OTHER THAN FOR AGRICULTURAL PURPOSES  
 OR WHERE A PROPERTY CAN BE BUILT      
 INSIDE AN APPROVED AREA.THE PURPOSE OF
 THESE RESTRICTIONS IS TO PREVENT THE  
 FURTHER LOSS OF FARMING LAND AND TO   
 PREVENT THE EXISTING CHARACTER OF THE 
 VILLAGES AND LANDSCAPE FROM BEING     
 DESTROYED.THE THATCHED BUILDINGS GIVE 
 THEIR OWNERS CERTAIN PROBLEMS AS      
 THATCH DETERIORATES WITH TIME AND THE 
 SERVICES OF A THATCHER ARE DIFFICULT  
 TO OBTAIN AND ARE EXPENSIVE.THESE     
 BUILDING ARE ALSO EXPENSIVE TO INSURE 
 AGAINST FIRE.
