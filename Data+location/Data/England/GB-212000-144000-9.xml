		<title>09Transport on Lundy.</title>
		<content> There are no real roads on Lundy.     
 Besides the main N/W. track there is a
 track which goes down to the Landing  
 Beach where supplies are picked up.   
 Because of the lack of roads,and the  
 fact that virtually everyone lives in 
 the village,cars are unnecessary.There
 are 4 tractors.(One of them is always 
 used on the beach to launch and land  
 the cobble, and to unload supplies    
 from the landing craft).The 3 Big Reds
 (Honda trikes)are used for tasks like 
 carrying luggage to and from the      
 helicopter.The Land Rover is used for 
 emergencies,accidents and rough       
 ground. We saw a lady who had cut her 
 leg and she was picked up by the Land 
 Rover before being flown by helicopter
 to hospital.The bulldozer,besides     
 earth-moving,is sometimes used for    
 snow clearance in the winter-but snow 
 is rare.{J.Perryman and M.Glastonbury.</content>
