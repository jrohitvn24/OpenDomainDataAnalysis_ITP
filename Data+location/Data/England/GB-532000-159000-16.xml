		<content>{     KENLEY WATERWORKS AND CHALK PLANT
 The water is pumped from chalk below  
 the Water table.The Works are 91 years
 old,built in 1894.It is now           
 computerized ,with each of the 5 bore 
 holes having its own computer.Three   
 men are needed to run it working on an
 eight hour shift 24 hours a day.On    
 average 30 men are employed there.    
  About 3,000,000 gallons of water is  
 pumped up per day,supplying Kenley,   
 Whyteleafe and Warlingham on its way  
 to Warlingham Reservoir.The water is  
 pumped from 100m into softening tanks 
 where it is treated with chlorine and 
 amonia.Quick lime is added to the     
 water,and then it is left for five    
 hours to settle.The chalk that is     
 produced is dried in the chalk plant, 
 placed in sacks and sent all over the 
 world.
