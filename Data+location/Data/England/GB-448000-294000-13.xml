		<content> With two very active community centres
 there is much on offer for recreation 
 and interest.There are various clubs  
 that members of the villages can      
 attend ;these                         
 include,tabletennis,badminton,the     
 W.I.,the Wednesday club, a library    
 service run by the community with help
 from the county service,evening       
 classes in such subjects as yoga and  
 local history,and probably the most   
 involved society the Croft            
 Entertainments Committee.This         
 committee was set up to provide money 
 for the summer school to usefully     
 occupy childrens' time in the long    
 summer break. It has gone from        
 strength to strength and involves all 
 ages and all sections of the          
 community.The shows that are produced 
 are not only good but serve the       
 community in the best possible sense. </content>
