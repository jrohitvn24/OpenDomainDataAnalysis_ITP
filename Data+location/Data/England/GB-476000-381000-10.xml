		<content>{LOCAL HISTORY }Area could have been   
 settled as early as 500 B.C. Roman    
 invasion of AD.43 started the crossing
 of the Trent at Littleborough or      
 Segelocum with the road leading       
 from Doncaster to Lincoln. The name   
 Leverton suggests  Saxon origin       
 probably a croft left by the Romans   
 and developed by Saxons invading by   
 the Trent. Legreton was its  name     
 in the Domesday Book. Habbblesthorpe  
 was a seperate parish with church     
 keeping a paid prebend in York        
 minster with the name Appesthorpe.    
 Leverton has a seat in the chapter    
 house at  Southwell Minster. The      
 flooding of the Trent side vilages was
 decreased in 1769 by the building of  
 banks on the Trent and the            
 digging of the catch water drain from 
 Rampton to West Burton.
