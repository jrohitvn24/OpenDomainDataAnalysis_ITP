		<title>02WOODSPRING PRIORY</title>
		<content> The building of the priory began in   
 the thirteenth century.The site,which 
 covers two acres,has seen two         
 churches-the first one was burned.The 
 Priory is now looked after by the     
 Landmark Trust and is open every day  
 of the year.                          
 The ancient building is undergoing    
 renovation.It houses a small museum   
 and ,we are told two ghosts:one,a     
 lady,walks in the garden on the full  
 moon and the other who hovers and     
 clanks chains in the church.          
 A spiral staircase made of 97 stone   
 steps leads to the top of the tower   
 which is 65 feet above ground level.  
 Sheep graze in the peaceful orchard of
 the Priory and there is a             
 tythe-barn nearby which belongs to the
 Priory.
