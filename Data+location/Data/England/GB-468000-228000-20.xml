		<content> The area here described could be      
 called by some the heart of Britain by
 others a backwater of no importance.  
 True there is little employment within
 the area, little unemployment too. The
 villages have their beginnings way    
 back in time and are close to one of  
 the country's newest cities. At a     
 casual glance nothing ever seems to   
 happen. If you take time to look there
 is so much to see and do. Some        
 families are known to have been here  
 for close to four hundred years others
 leave after less than four years. For 
 most of us it is home, or home from   
 home,and we wouldn't wish to move.
