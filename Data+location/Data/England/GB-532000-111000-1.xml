 WELCOME TO CARDEN MIDDLE SCHOOL'S     
{SECTION OF THE DOMESDAY PROJECT.}     
                                       
 Most of our area is chalky downland   
 and includes the escarpment of the    
 south downs.The land is almost        
 entirely farmland worked by eight     
 farms.There is also a sculptor who    
 lives at Oakwood farm.He uses         
 wood,stone and marble (see page 2).In 
 westmeston there is a church which was
 built in the 12th century (see page   
 5).There are no emergency services in 
 the village.The population of horses  
 is greater than that of the           
 people.Also in the area is Plumpton   
 Agricultural College the land of which
 covers 1000 acres not all of which is 
 in our area(see page 6&amp;7).            </content>
