		<title>11HOW CORMELIAN DIED</title>
		<content> There was a giant called Cormoran who 
 lived on St Michael's Mount.  He had a
 wife called Cormelian. One day he     
 needed a hammer to mend his boot so he
 shouted to another giant who shared   
 the hammer with Cormoran. The other   
 giant was not a very good thrower.    
 As he threw the hammer Cormelian      
 came outside to see what Cormoran was 
 doing. The hammer was coming over and 
 hit Cormelian between the eyes and she
 fell down dead. Cormoran was very sad 
 because Cormelian was dead.           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
