		<title>04 THE RIVERSIDE PRESS</title>
		<content>    The Riverside Press factory employs
 about 50 people and is in Whiddon     
 Valley, Barnstaple. It has a lot of   
 machines.It also has a lot of         
 paper because they make about 2,000   
 magazines an hour. They use fork-lift 
 trucks to carry the post in. There are
 several different rooms for different 
 processes, and they even make their   
 own staples for the magazines. The    
 firm makes different types of         
 magazines, for example pop, football, 
 video, computer etc. Some magazines   
 are sent to be sold in shops, others  
 are sent through the post to buyers.  
    The factory was very noisy. We all 
 had to wear earplugs to protect our   
 ears.It was quite clean and apart from
 the noise it would be a good place to 
 work.
