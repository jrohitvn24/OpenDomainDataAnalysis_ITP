		<content> The St.Thomas More Roman Catholic     
 Church was the first church in the    
 world to be named after St.Thomas     
 More. The modern building was built in
 1962 and its east window contains a   
 large engraved glass figure of        
 St.Thomas More. The Golden Jubilee of 
 the Parish of St.Thomas More took     
 place on 7th July 1985. This Mass was 
 conducted by Cardinal Basil Hume.     
 Canon Harold Windstone is the Parish  
 Priest.                               
 The United Reformed Church was built  
 in 1887. The church is usually kept   
 locked except when services are being 
 held. This is because damage has been 
 caused by vandals in the past. The    
 present Minister is the Reverend      
 Gordon Bellamy. He is the Chairman of 
 the Board of Governors of Knebworth   
 Primary School. He often takes the    
 School assembly.                      </content>
