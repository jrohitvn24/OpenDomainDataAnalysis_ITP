		<title>20A STOTTESDON PENSIONER'S DAY</title>
		<content>{I am a widow with one son}living at   
 home. My day begins at 7am. with our  
 breakfast, then all the usual         
 household jobs. Coffee time comes     
 and a look at the morning paper.      
 Then I finish the housework and       
 have lunch followed by a rest before  
 going into the garden, weather        
 permitting, to do the jobs that keep  
 the garden tidy. On wet days the      
 afternoon is spent knitting, sewing or
 reading. The evening meal is then     
 prepared, cooked and eaten. The rest  
 of the evening is spent watching      
 television, sewing or knitting until  
 about 10.30pm., then bed and a book to
 read.
