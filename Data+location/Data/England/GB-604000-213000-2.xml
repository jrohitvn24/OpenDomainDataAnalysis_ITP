		<title>02EAST MERSEA'S DEMOGRAPHY</title>
		<content> East Mersea had a population of 273 in
 1981 which was only one more than in  
 1971. There are slightly more males   
 than females(141m/132f) which is      
 different to the national ratio.      
 Almost 25% of the population are over 
 65 which is above the national average
 but surprisingly the number of        
 children (62) is about the national   
 average. One-third of households have 
 children and 40% have at least one    
 pensioner. This suggests that East    
 Mersea is popular for both retirement 
 and families. Only 8.8% of the        
 economically active population are    
 unemployed but a very high 25% are    
 self employed.A survey of households  
 revealed 56% worked on Mersea Island, 
 25% in Colchester and about 10% in    
 London.These results reflect the large
 number of self-employed and employment
 in farming.                           </content>
