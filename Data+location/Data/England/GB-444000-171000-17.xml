		<title>17THE FARMERS ATTITUDES</title>
		<content> The farmer was concerned about the bad
 image farmers have as a result of     
 being known to be subsidised by the   
 government. Another problem is        
 political policy;one minute the       
 government encourages the farmers to  
 produce more and the next to cut      
 back-an impossible reversal.It also   
 worried him that there was no way of  
 using the surplus grain he produces to
 help the famine in places like Ethopia
 which would never be self sufficent   
 because of the climate. Imports were  
 another problem as this farm used to  
 produce hay and sell it to local      
 racing stables but now they buy       
 imported hay which is cheaper and more
 uniform in quality. Insurance of crops
 is too expensive so if a crop is      
 damaged by hailstones for example,the 
 farmer suffers a loss.His traditional 
 problem,weather is still the main one!</content>
