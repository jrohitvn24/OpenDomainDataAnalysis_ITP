		<title>12OPENCAST MINING IN RIPLEY</title>
		<content> People are worried about the fact that
 there is going to be an opencast coal 
 mine in this area.The area at the     
 moment has fields with flowers and    
 birds in.The people know that this    
 will be ruined because around the pit 
 there woll be thirty foot mounds of   
 earth and the dust will make the cars,
 walls,washing etc dirty.It would also 
 mean that nobody could play on the    
 fields and people would have to take  
 their dogs for a walk somewhere else. 
 All of the plant life and the wildlife
 will have to go,along with all the    
 public footpaths of which there are   
 13.People are trying to stop them from
 going ahead with the opencast.So far  
 they have written to the Prime        
 Minister for help,and made            
 badges,posters and stickers.They are  
 trying very hard,to stop the mining.
