		<title>19A Local Building Firm.</title>
		<content> F.K.Wilkins and Sons is a local       
 building firm in Hilmarton, which was 
 started by Frank Wilkins but today is 
 run by his son Melvyn. Melvyn's day   
 can start at 07.30 and runs until     
 about 17.30., or later in the summer. 
 He may even receive emergency calls   
 before he leaves in the morning.      
 During the day he could be doing a    
 variety of jobs.He could be erecting  
 scaffolding for the re-building of a  
 chimney, building a Victorian style   
 conservatory at a local inn, attending
 to a leaking cattle trough, six fields
 away from the nearest hard road,      
 unblocking the drains at the local    
 vicarage or erecting cat walks to a   
 grain dryer installation 40 feet above
 the ground. In the evenings he has    
 time to work in his office, at home,  
 on estimates and accounts or, in the  
 summer, he might continue on a job.   </content>
