		<title>18Mrs B.A Newcomer To The Area</title>
		<content> Mrs B. is new to the area.She was born
 in London and lived there until 1980, 
 then she moved with her husband and   
 daughter to St Ives and in Jan.1985 to
 Needingworth.She made the move to buy 
 an affordable house and wanted her    
 child to be brought up in the country.
 Mrs B. trained as a nursery nurse and 
 now works at the local school.In her  
 spare time she likes to read or do    
 some gardening.                       
 She thinks London has changed for the 
 worst and is now more threatening what
 with traffic and hooliganism.However, 
 women have more freedom of choice and 
 most people have enough money.She uses
 local shops weekdays but her father   
 drives her to Cambridge on Saturdays. 
 Mrs B.'s parents moved to the village 
 three years ago.For the future, she   
 just wishes for her and her family to 
 have a happy life.                    </content>
