		<content> The population of the Newton Abbot    
 area seems to be increasing, if the   
 new housing estates are anything to go
 by. Many people, it seems, come to the
 area from other parts of the country  
 in order to give themselves and their 
 families a{'better way of life'.}The  
 native Devonshire folk seem to get    
 less and less.                        
 Some people believe that a greater    
 proportion of the population are{older
{people}who have retired to Devon.     
 This, together with{young people      
 moving away to find suitable jobs,    
 might mean a population that is       
 getting older. The population seems to
 change a lot, as people move out and  
 new people move in.
