This part of Loughton is the location of the London County Council built Debden Estate - housing built to a cottage style and planned around the existing features of the landscape. The land undulates with the housing hugging the ground. Only new structures built onto the Epping Forest College and some large office buildings on the industrial estate next to the M11 junction pierce this low profile.&lt;br />&lt;br />The last two winters heavy snow was a feature - huge snow balls were rolled on the public green space and left like huge Henry Moore sculptures on the slopes. Farmland either side of the motorway is still planted up. Peas have been grown in the fields nearest the housing but few would have known this as allotment grounds, streams and school grounds form a buffer, hiding the rural scene beyond. Part of the area forms part of the Epping Forest - a protected area of forest preserved by the Corporation of London for the use of the public at the end of the 1 9th century. The shopping parade within the housing estate has recently had an overhaul - the streetscape has been changed so that the previous central reservation of shrubbery has been taken away and a more pedestrian frendly paving scheme installed. New trees have been planted in the stead of the removed roses. The motorway junction continues to be access to and from the London direction only. This may be because the land either side of it forms a Site of Special Interest for its fauna and flora.   &lt;br />
