 Unfortunately we also have MINUS      
 house-points  for being silly and for 
 forgetting homework. No-one likes     
 getting those as it leads to          
 detention.At the end of the year the  
 house with the most points wins the   
 cup. There is also a cup for the      
 individual person with the most points
 throughout the year.                  
 There is certainly a lot going on at  
 my school!
