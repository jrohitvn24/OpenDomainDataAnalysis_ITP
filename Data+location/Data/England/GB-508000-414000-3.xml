 We have a Youth Club in the village on
 Thursday nights from 7 p.m. until lO  
 p.m. at night but I usually go home at
 lO.3O with Emma because her Mum is    
 Secretary and her Dad is the          
 Chairman. At the Youth Club we play   
 snooker, pool, table tennis and darts.
 Terri Elsom is one of the players in  
 our group. We play other things like  
 "girl's world" for the girls to play  
 with but me and my friends always sit 
 by the tape recorder and sing to it.  
 In the Community Centre  we have      
 disco's and sometimes film shows. The 
 Community Centre is fairly new. It    
 used to be a wooden building called   
 Jubilee Hall. Our school used to have 
 plays there because we hadn't got a   
 hall of our own. Children playing     
 nearly set fire to the old building   
 during the last War our teacher said. </content>
