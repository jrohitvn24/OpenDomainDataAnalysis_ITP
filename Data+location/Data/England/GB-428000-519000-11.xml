		<title>11Farming in Brafferton</title>
		<content>   The{European Common Market's}milk   
 policy of controlling output by means 
 of quotas seems to have had little    
 direct impact on the dairy farmers in 
 the Brafferton area. However the      
{Common Agricultural Policy}has helped 
 to keep up wheat prices and may in the
 near future encourage the growing of  
 more oil-seed rape.                   
                                       
   One amusing example of changing     
 ideas is that about the time of the   
 Second World War many farmers thought 
 that barley would kill cattle if it   
 was used for feed. Now it is ,with    
 silage ,their main fodder.            
                                       
   Another example of change is the    
 increase in{average field sizes}from  
 about 10 acres to between 20 and 30   
 acres - a typical day's work with     
 modern machinery.                     </content>
