		<title>12SUNDAY IN ELLINGTON</title>
		<content>   The family have a short lie in on   
 Sunday. They get up at 8.00am and     
 have breakfast at about 8.15am.They   
 have Alpen or Cornflakes. They don't  
 have Sunday papers delivered but they 
 go out to buy them when they have     
 been to church.They have to travel to 
 church because there is no Roman      
 Catholic church in Ellington.         
   The papers they buy are the Sun  and
 The Mirror.                           
 They don't have a traditional Sunday  
 lunch. instead they have a salad or   
 sandwiches. Mr and Mrs Beaumont       
 usually have a beer to drink.         
 On Sunday afternoon they do the       
 gardening. Then they have tea. They   
 watch  the television in the evening  
 and then they go to bed. Lee goes     
 to bed at 8.00pm and his parents go at
 11.00pm.
