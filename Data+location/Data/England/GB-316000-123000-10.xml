		<title>10The Grand Western Canal.</title>
		<content>   The Canal was built in the early    
 nineteenth century. It was not long   
 however, before the railway was built 
 between Taunton and Exeter. Eventually
 the canal was closed and slowly fell  
 into disrepair.                       
   We set off on our walk, in a field  
 near Longaller Farm, expecting to see 
 a canal full of water but there wasn't
 much evidence that there had been a   
 canal at all!  We did see an old      
 wooden bridge crossing a ditch, but   
 the farmer had filled most of it in.  
   After crossing fields we actually   
 found some water but it looked just   
 like a pond.  Then there was a length 
 of embankment which showed the route  
 of the canal quite clearly.  We saw   
 the best preserved length of canal    
 near Bradford-on-Tone, on either side 
 of Trefusis Farm. One part of it had  
 recently been cleared as a fish pond. </content>
