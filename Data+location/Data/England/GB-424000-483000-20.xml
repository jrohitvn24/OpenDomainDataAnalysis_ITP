		<content>   The area around Snape is not        
 changing a great deal. New houses are 
 being built in the village itself and 
 families new to the area have moved in
 particularly over the last 10 years.  
   The Village School children felt    
 they did not want the village to      
 change, but would like to see one or  
 two additions, such as a library, play
 school and a small cafe.              
   Whether the plans to upgrade a      
 nearby main road into Wensleydale and 
 the arrival of three fighter squadrons
 at R.A.F Leeming, will affect life in 
 the village, only time will tell.
