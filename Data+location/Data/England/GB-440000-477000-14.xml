		<content>    Most of the housing is in farms and
 tied cottages - cottages belonging to 
 owners of farms where farm workers    
 live. Some farms offer bed and        
 breakfast hospitality for visitors to 
 the area.                             
    Most homes own a freezer, and meat,
 fish and vegetables are preserved by  
 freezing. Many of the farmers will    
 freeze their own meat and vegetables  
 for home consumption, instead of      
 buying from shops. The majority of    
 homes have an automatic washing       
 machine for clothes, and several have 
 dishwashers and microwave ovens, the  
 latter being a quick energy saving way
 of cooking food. Most homes have a    
 television and video recorders are    
 becoming more popular.                
    Heating is by solid fuel, oil or   
 electricity. The most popular domestic
 pets are cats and dogs.               </content>
