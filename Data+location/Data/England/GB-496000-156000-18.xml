		<content> Hobbies are favourite things for      
 people to do in their spare time,such 
 as collecting, making and watching and
 doing. Some people collect stamps,    
 which is known as Philately,          
 butterflies, coins or articles from   
 magazines, antiques or even beer cans 
 and bottle tops. Many ladies enjoy    
 knitting, making jumpers, doing       
 embroidery or even sewing for the     
 house. Many make model aeroplanes or  
 pottery or toys and do carpentry.     
   Others don't like to stay in.       
 Instead they like energetic hobbies   
 like football, cricket, squash and    
 tennis, golf and swimming. Then there 
 is gardening, birdwatching,painting   
 and photography and many, many more.
