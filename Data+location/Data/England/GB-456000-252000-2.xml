		<title>02CLUBS IN PRESTON CAPES</title>
		<content> Preston capes has a thriving Womens   
 Institute. It was formed in 1924 with 
 a break during the Second World War   
 years. There are 28 members with 23   
 actively participating. It is a       
 self-supporting charitable group. In  
 l982 the upkeep of the Village Hall   
 was taken over from the W.I. by a new 
 Management Hall Committee made up of  
 elected members of the Community. The 
 Cricket Club was formed around l850   
 when all of the players lived in and  
 around the village. Nowadays only 2   
 live in the area and 2 are            
 ex-villagers. The Parochial Church    
 Council deals with anything concerning
 the Church. Most residents support at 
 least one of the organisations        
 including the Conservative            
 Association.
