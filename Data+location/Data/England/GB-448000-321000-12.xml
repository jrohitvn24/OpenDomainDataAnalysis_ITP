 Most of the population gather         
 information through                   
 television,radio,newspapers and       
 libraries.                            
    Much of their spare time they spend
 watching the television anyway.Nearly 
 every home has a telephone and via    
 this they are able to gather          
 information from anywhere in the      
 world.                                
    Sometimes people need to get legal 
 advice and this can be obtained       
 through a free legal service housed in
 the nearest town.                     
    Each village has a library and this
 can usually give the information      
 needed or give an address or phone    
 number of someone else who could help.
