		<content> We did a survey of men and woman of   
 the average age group from 30 to 40.  
 From the parents of{Beechwood}and     
 Rivermead.{90%}of the women use       
{telephones}daily .Only{85%}of the men 
 use it daily.The amount of{post}for   
 the men was{90%}but ladies only have  
{11%}thats probably because men usually
 receive{bills}and{business            
 letters,etc. When we looked at the    
{friends door to door}we found out the 
 percentages varied quite a bit.To be  
 precise{60%}of the men had door to    
 door callers and the ladies had       
{80%,}thats because most ladies stay at
 home during the day. We were suprised 
 that every household had at least one 
{telephone},some had 2 or 3. Nobody    
 had a{radio telephone.
