		<content> Hamble's most important feature is its
 river.The{River Hamble}is six miles   
 long up to Botley.It has a busy port  
 at its mouth with a harbour master    
 and an assistant ready to give advice.
 On the river there is an{inshore}     
{rescue}which can be launched any time 
 of day or night in seven minutes.The  
{Hamble to Warsash ferry}was started in
 1493.The present day ferryman is Ray  
 Sedgewick and he has been doing it    
 every day of the year for 27 years.In 
 the olden days the passengers had to  
 row themselves.There is a Norman      
 church,built in 1109,called{Saint}    
{Andrews church}and many old cottages  
 from the 17th and 18th century.One of 
 these is the{Gun House},used by       
 smugglers in the C18th.There are many 
 boatyards and marinas alongside the   
 river.There are also four pubs and a  
 variety of shops.                     </content>
