		<content> This is part of a typical day,as      
 described by a young housewife living 
 in Lastingham.                        
 "To be awakened by bird song &amp; the    
 ripple of the stream outside is very  
 pleasant. However,the bleeping of the 
 quartz alarm clock or the even louder 
 buzzing of the automatic tea maker are
 usually required to awake the sleeping
 household. I,by this time am in the   
 kitchen preparing breakfast,atomatic  
 kettle on,pop-up toaster ready for    
 action. The sliced bacon &amp; tomatoes   
 are under the grill on the electric   
 cooker &amp; the eggs being cracked into  
 the frying pan on top. The remainder  
 of the family are now dressed &amp;       
 assembled round the table eating. The 
 conversation rises &amp; falls around the 
 sounds of radio 2,giving out the days 
 news &amp; weather. Breakfast over,the    
 children then catch the school bus.   </content>
