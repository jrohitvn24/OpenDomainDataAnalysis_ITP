		<title>04Housing in Tiptoe Village.</title>
		<content> From a survey of housing in Tiptoe we 
 discovered that the most popular type 
 of housing is a detached bungalow     
 followed by detached houses, chalet   
 bungalows, semi-detached houses and   
 two caravans. Mrs Lilly lives in a two
 bedroom detached bungalow, built in   
 1932. She lives with her husband and  
 mother. They have 6 rooms including a 
 bathroom and toilet and have central  
 heating. She prefers living in the    
 bungalow to her previous house. Mrs   
 Turner lives in a detached 2 bedroom  
 house built in 1935. She lives with   
 her husband. They have 5 rooms        
 including a bathroom and toilet and   
 have central heating. They keep a     
 horse in their garden. Mrs Benham     
 lives in a 4 bedroom chalet bungalow  
 with her husband and 2 children. They 
 have central heating.
