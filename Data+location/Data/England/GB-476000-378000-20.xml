		<content> The written material for these pages  
 of text have been compiled mainly by  
 the pupils from Rampton Primary       
 School. They worked very hard during a
 very wet and dismall Summer Term 1985,
 to collect the data and prepare it for
 entry onto the computer disk.         
   We also give credit to others in the
 community who helped with the data    
 count, particularly in deciding the   
 nature of the land cover. In a rural  
 district this is a very difficult     
 task.                                 
   We offer our best wishes to all     
 those who take interest in our        
 contribution to the BBC Domesday      
 Survey in the future.
