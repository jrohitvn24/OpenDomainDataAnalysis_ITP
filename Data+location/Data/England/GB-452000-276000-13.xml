		<title>13Life in Newton</title>
		<content>   Newton is a small,pleasant village  
 with a peaceful atmosphere.The spirit 
 of village life remains with fetes,   
 flower shows,whist drives and         
 barbecues held in a field or the      
 village hall.As most families have 1  
 car,the hourly bus service appears    
 adequate.Children also enjoy village  
 life.As Christine says,"With friendly 
 neighbours you need never fear leaving
 your back door unlocked.Farmers allow 
 children to explore." Helen enjoys    
 helping grandad on the farm."In winter
 I feed the cattle;when we are hay     
 making,I bring Dad his tea." Alison   
 goes to Sunday School where "...the   
 meeting starts in one church and      
 finishes in the other," and she       
 "..goes sledging in a farmer's field."
 The United Reform Church and the C of 
 E hold joint services though neither  
 has a resident minister.              </content>
