		<content>   Sturminster Newton and the          
 surrounding villages are full of      
 historical facts.In Hinton St.Mary,Mr.
 White,a local farmer accidentally     
 found a Roman mosaic.It was inlaid    
 with a picture of Jesus,perhaps the   
 first known picture in England!Made in
 AD 315, the mosaic was found in 1964  
 and,because of the possibility of     
 there being a whole villa under his   
 land,he is not allowed to build on it.
   In Sturminster Newton,there are     
 archways for coaches,left in the pub  
 walls.                                
   Halfway between Sturminster and     
 Hinton there is a medeival Tythe Barn,
 used for storing 10% of the farmer's  
 crops,which they had to give to the   
 Church.It is made of stone and thatch.
   In the centre of Sturminster is the 
 C15th market cross,made of stone.
