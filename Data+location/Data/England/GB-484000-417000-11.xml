		<title>11Burton Before 1939</title>
		<content> Before the 2nd World War there were   
 few roads in Burton.The roads that I  
 remember are the High St.and Normanby 
 Rd.The land,apart from a few houses,  
 was mainly fields.Now new houses have 
 been built so there are more streets. 
 In 1940 all children received their   
 education in the new school,but before
 1940 girls went to school near the    
 church and boys went to school in     
 Normanby.Transport for the boys was   
 only a horse drawn cart.On Sundays    
 children had to dress in their best   
 clothes for church and when they      
 arrived home they changed.The only    
 transport there would be in Burton was
 a horse drawn bus and it would take   
 about an hour to get to Scunthorpe.   
 When women went shopping they went    
 mostly in the evening,they went to the
 market because it was cheaper.
