 When we studied our area we looked out
 over the estuary to see all the small 
 craft at{Instow}and the larger boats  
 sailing in and out of Bideford. In    
 June two elderly men were fishing from
 a small boat, it overturned and one   
 man was drowned. The lifeboat from    
 Appledore picked up both men and the  
 helicopter from Chivenor lifted both  
 men and took them to the North Devon  
 District Hospital. Unfortunately one  
 man was beyond recovery. It made us   
 realise that the estuary can be very  
 dangerous place to swim or sail.      
   There are a few lifebelts and ropes 
 on the shoreline but it would be      
 impossible to rescue someone from the 
 shore if the tide was sweeping them   
 away. The current on an outgoing tide 
 is often too strong for small boats   
 never mind swimmers.                  </content>
