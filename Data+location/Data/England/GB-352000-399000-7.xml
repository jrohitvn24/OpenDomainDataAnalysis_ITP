		<title>07OTTERSWIFT COTTAGE</title>
		<content>   Otterswift Cottage was built in 1715
 and Mrs Ashby has lived there for 8   
 years. All Junior A went down to      
 interview her about her life in       
 Billinge. She told  us everything she 
 knew about Billinge. We asked her     
 things like why is your house called  
 Otterswift Cottage, she said that     
 there might have been otters down by  
 the farm.                             
 We also asked her how many pets she   
 has, she has got 2 dogs,seven cats and
 twenty hens shared with next door.    
  The cottage now has modern facilties 
 but is no longer a listed building. At
 one time the cottage was used to house
 horses and cows but people have lived 
 in it for nearly thirty years.        
  After the successful interview Mrs   
 Ashby showed us round her cottage and 
 then it was time to go back to school 
 in the minibus.                       </content>
