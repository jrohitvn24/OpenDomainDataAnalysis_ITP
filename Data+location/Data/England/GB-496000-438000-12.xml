		<title>12BISHOP BURTON FARM OPEN DAY</title>
		<content> This annual event was first introduced
 in 1978 by the Principal of Bishop    
 Burton College of Agriculture, Mr D.  
 Hurst (who died in 1985), as a means  
 of{"introducing the town to the       
{country"}while raising money for      
 recreational facilities for college   
 students. An average of Â£3500 has been
 raised each year which has contributed
 to the building of the College Sports 
 Hall.There is a wide range of events  
 organised to reflect all aspects of   
 farming life - in the home and on the 
 farm.  All students and staff work    
 together to provide livestock         
 husbandry, machinery and horticultural
 displays, exhibitions of spinning,    
 embroidery, dressmaking and cookery,  
 organised children's sports, tractor  
 rides. This year, sky diving was a    
 popular feature.{Town and Country Day 
 is very hard work but worth it!       </content>
