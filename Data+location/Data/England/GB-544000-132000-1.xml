		<title>01GENERAL REVIEW OF AREA</title>
		<content>  {Upper Hartfield}in the north-east is
 an extension of{Hartfield.  Coleman's 
{Hatch,}a separate village has a church
 under the jurisdiction of the         
 Hartfield Rector.                     
   The area lies between 250 and 650   
 feet above sea level and is a mixture 
 of open and wooded land.  The extreme 
 NW corner touches the River Medway and
 the disused railway, used as a        
 footpath, runs along this valley.     
   The main industry of this area is   
 agriculture, cattle, sheep, riding    
 stables and arable.  There are many   
 large houses some formerly farmhouses.
 The arable farms have seasonal work   
 put out to contractors, hence farm    
 workers cottages are now inhabited by 
 commuters to London or nearby towns.  
   In the south of the area is{Ashdown 
{Forest}owned by the Earl De Le Warr   
 and administered by Conservators.     </content>
