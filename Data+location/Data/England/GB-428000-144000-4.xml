		<title>04OPEN AREAS AND FIELDS.</title>
		<content>   Most of the fields are under arable 
 crop production or intensive grass and
 are sprayed with herbicides to keep   
 them free from weeds, but around their
 headlands where the spray hasn't      
 penetrated there is an abundance of   
 wild plants including cleavers,       
 may-weeds, poppies, chickweed and     
 buttercups. In the open spaces and    
 less intensive farmland ribwort,      
 thistles, docks, spurge and tansy     
 predominate.                          
   Bird-life abounds: pheasants and    
 partridges, larks overhead, magpies,  
 blackbirds and jays, while kestrels   
 hover, searching for prey.            
   Ears of wheat are colonised by the  
 grain aphid which, in turn, attracts  
 ladybirds and hover-flies.            
   A variety of footpaths and tracks,  
 fairly well signposted, enable the    
 walker to enjoy the countryside.      </content>
