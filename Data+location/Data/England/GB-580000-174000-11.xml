		<title>11STOKE VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content>{Stoke Village Hall}was completed in   
 1980 at a cost of Â£50,000. Much of    
 this was raised by the villagers      
 themselves with the remainder coming  
 from Council grants and contributions.
  The hall is situated opposite the    
 Chapel and is conveniently sited for  
 most part of the village _ an         
 essential factor in community life.   
 The Hall has one main room capable of 
 holding 120 people, a large room with 
 kitchen facilities, a chair store and 
 cloakrooms.  The activities and       
 functions held in lthe hall are many  
 and range from a playgroup for 3_5 yr 
 olds to activities such as Majorettes,
 Youth Drama, O.A.P. Club and the      
 W.I..weekend functions often include  
 wedding receptions and dances.  All   
 local organisations pay reduced rates 
 for booking, while others pay on a    
 sliding scale.                        </content>
