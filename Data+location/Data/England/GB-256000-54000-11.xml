  A couple of farms in the area have   
 decided that the{computer}would be a  
 boon to the working of their farms.   
 The computers are of modest sizes but 
 coupled with a printer can readily aid
 the farmers in the day to day routine 
 work.                                 
 They are used to{keep records of the  
{cow herds}:- Numbers to identify them,
 their ages,illnesses,pregnancies,rate 
 of feed and milk yield are all        
 recorded.                             
  These records can be accessed very   
 quickly abd as such provide quick     
 reference to the herd.                
  The actual{running costs}of the farm 
 can also be aided by the speed of     
 processing of the computer.
