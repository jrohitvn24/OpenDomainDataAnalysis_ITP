		<title>04THE PILGRIM'S REST</title>
		<content>     The Pilgrim's Rest was built in   
 the twelth century. It was originally 
 a farmhouse with several acres of     
 land. It was rebuilt in the fourteenth
 century on the old foundations,       
 possibly due to earthquake damage in  
 the thirteenth century. It was        
 originally named Ye Olde Pilgrim's    
 Rest'e but when George the second     
 became king it became The Kings Head. 
 Monks used to occupy the building and 
 brewed their own cider.               
     In 1975 the then owner changed the
 name back to The Pilgrim's Rest, as it
 stands on the Pilgrim's Way.          
     It is said to have a ghost dating 
 from the nineteenth century and the   
 current owners, Mr. and Mrs. K. Lee   
 have often felt a presence there.     
     It is well known for its wide     
 selection of real ales and is often   
 used by modern day pilgrims.          </content>
