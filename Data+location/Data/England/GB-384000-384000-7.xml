		<title>07A Farm in Cheadle Hulme.</title>
		<content> Stanley Hill Farm is a small 50 acre  
 farm used for cattle and poultry.It is
 250 years old and the only farm in    
 Cheadle Hulme that has had no         
 alterations.It has 20 ducks,2000 hens 
 and 600 young chicks.The farmer buys  
 l0 tonnes of food each month for the  
 animals.The hens are kept in batches  
 of 300 until they are old enough to   
 lay eggs.The eggs are collected every 
 day and a machine sorts them into 7   
 sizes.The farmer keeps Fresian and    
 Hereford-Cross for beef,fattening and 
 then selling them when they are 2     
 years old.The farmer used to keep     
 dairy cattle but found it too         
 difficult without sons to help        
 him.The land is only suitable         
 for grazing because the soil is too   
 heavy for crops.
