		<title>20TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATION</title>
		<content> Transport here is much the same as    
 anywhere else. Nearly every household 
 owns a car or form of motor vehicle,  
 possibly two in some cases. In Mengham
 there is a bus station which runs     
 buses nos. 301 and 302 from Havant Bus
 Station to Hayling holiday centres and
 no. 702 from Hayling to Southsea.     
 There was once a railway and this was 
 discontinued in 1963,but the track and
 old station can still be seen. There  
 is only one road off the Island which 
 causes problems during the holiday    
 season. We have several public        
 telephones and a phone in nearly every
 house. We also have one post office in
 our area.
