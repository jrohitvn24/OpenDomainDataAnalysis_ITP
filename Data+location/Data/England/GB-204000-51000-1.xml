		<content>      We live in an area including the 
 towns and villages of St. Blazey, Par,
 Carlyon Bay and Tregrehan. This area  
 has much to do with China Clay and    
 contains many clay processing plants. 
      The Cornish Leisure world is a   
 very popular attraction, both for     
 tourists and residents alike, and many
 famous and not so famous stars have   
 appeared there.                       
      During the Summer there are many 
 tourists in the area, staying in the  
 many hotels, guest houses, and camping
 and caravan sites, particularly those 
 at Carlyon Bay.                       
      The majority of people enjoy     
 living in the area, and many tourists 
 return again and again to sample the  
 many delights and excellent facilities
 of this area.
