		<title>09CABINET MAKER QUEEN CAMEL</title>
		<content>    The cabinet maker's shop was       
  opened in 1977. Mr Robinson has been 
 a cabinet maker since the age of 15,  
 when he was apprenticed.              
   Woods used include mahogony, oak,   
 ash, beech, apple,  yew, hazelwood and
 the rarer satin wood and rosewood.Wood
 comes from all over the country and   
 he imports wood too.Applewood,        
 however, he buys from local people.The
 wood must be dry  so that it doesn't  
 shrink.It is left in the air a year   
 for every inch of thickness.          
    Mr Robinson is very careful to     
 choose the best wood for his          
 furniture.The graining is most        
 important.He uses mainly traditional  
 hand tools,some are home made         
 specialist tools.He also  uses        
 electric saws and lathes.             
    Customers are mainly regular.
