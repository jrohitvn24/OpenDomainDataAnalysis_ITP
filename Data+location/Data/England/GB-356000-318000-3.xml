		<title>03THE QUALITY OF RURAL LIFE</title>
		<content> There is virtually no ready-made      
 entertainment or diversions for young 
 or old, apart from the obvious        
 exceptions - tv and radio.  Young and 
 old therefore have to rely on their   
 own resourcefulness and that of their 
 friends.  The nearby villages offer   
 typical activities - clubs, amateur   
 dramatics, fetes, sport, etc. and     
 knowledge of forthcoming events is    
 usually communicated by word of mouth 
 or read in the local Press.           
 Compared with town dwellers, people   
 here know more about wild life and    
 vegetation, and in most households    
 there will be a competent gardener, as
 evidenced by some superb flower and   
 vegetable gardens.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
