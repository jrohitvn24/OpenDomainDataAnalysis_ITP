		<title>20COMMUNITY SHILLINGSTONE</title>
		<content> It is a great priviledge to be the    
 Headteacher of Shillingstone School,  
 and to experience at first hand the   
 extra-ordinary goodwill this village  
 community displays towards its        
 members. Those who are ill or bereaved
 are supported by the village in so    
 many ways and newcomers to the        
 village are made welcome and invited  
 to take part in village functions as  
 soon as they move in. I am sure that  
 the childrens kindness towards each   
 other is a direct result of their     
 parents thoughtfullness towards       
 others. This entry was compiled by the
 children of Shillingstone School,but  
 would not have been possible without  
 the generous help of a great many     
 members of the community.K.Ashcroft.
