		<content>   The sizes of the fields have changed
 over the years. A farmer used to have 
 a lot of small fields but now a farmer
 tends to have a few large fields so   
 that the farm machinery can work more 
 efficiently and turn round more       
 easily.                               
   Mr. Emmett does not like using too  
 many  chemicals because it would be   
 expensive and might ruin the crops or 
 even the land.                        
   If you look in most fields  on      
 Imberhorne Farm you would see a ditch 
 on either side. It is there because it
 helps to drain the fields.            
 In part of the farm is a large private
 house called Gullege. It is thought   
 that it was once one of Henry VIII's  
 hunting lodges.
