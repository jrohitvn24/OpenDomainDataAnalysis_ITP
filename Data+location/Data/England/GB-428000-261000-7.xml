		<content>      The{Heathcote Hospital}was opened
 as a 'fever' or Isolation Hospital in 
 1858. It remained as such for nearly  
 ninety years, treating all types of   
 infectious diseases. In 1950 it became
 a Chest Hospital changing in 1958 to a
 Hospital for the Elderly.             
      Since 1976 there have been four  
 wards,accomodating 107 patients.In    
 1982 a Day Unit was opened;this cares 
 for 125 patients in total at about 25 
 per day .The purpose of this unit is  
 to maintain  elderly people in their  
 own homes for as long as possible.    
      The average age of patients is   
 about 85;most are 'residential' in    
 that they will not get well enough to 
 return home.With this in mind the     
 hospital is as informal and 'homely'  
 as possible,allowing pets in the wards
 and even having donkeys for ferrying  
 patients around-in a cart of course!  </content>
