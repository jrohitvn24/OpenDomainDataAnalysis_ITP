		<content>      Par has 11 berths each one       
 up to 76.2 metres (250 feet) in       
 length. One of these berths was       
 specifically built for oil deliveries.
 The port can accommodate vessels of   
 over 1500 tonnes, although most       
 vessels are less than 1000 tonnes. The
 port dries out and cannot be used at  
 at low tide.                          
      Up to 1000000 (1 million) tonnes 
 of cargo are loaded every year, with  
 1800 vessels passing through the port 
 of Par every 12 months.               
{    }Lorries and trains are also used 
 to transport the clay from the        
 clayworks to Par. {                   
{HOW CHINA CLAY IS USED                
      China clay is used in the making 
 of paper, which is by far its largest 
 use. It is used as a filler for the   
 small surfaces between the pulp fibre.
