		<title>06OLD UPWOOD SCHOOL</title>
		<content>{Upwood school}was first started in    
 about 1900.It had two rooms.Both of   
 them made a lot of noise when you     
 entered because the floors were made  
 of wood and the ceiling was a long way
 up.The{infant department}was taught by
 Mrs. Denny and Mrs. Emmanuel,{Mr.Denny
{being the headmaster}taught in the    
 junior room.There were about thirty to
 forty pupils in each room.The         
 playground was a small area with four 
 outdoor toilets ,two for boys and two 
 for the girls.Games played were       
 skipping and hopscotch and the boys   
 grew mushrooms.The school was never   
 decorated and the smoke from the two  
 stoves almost blocked the view        
 completely.People took it in turns to 
 ring the bell.Mr.Denny liked music    
 lessons.
