 1.{Housing}:This has been the major   
 issue which has concerned the village.
 It was already the policy of the      
 company before the takeover to sell   
 its houses, but would the takeover    
 enhance this process? We conducted a

 answered intended to buy their houses 
 at the price set. The company has sold
 all its houses either to tenants, or  
 to an individual investing property   
 company.
