		<title>12FARMING</title>
		<content> A typical dairy farm in this area on  
 average will be approximately 100_120 
 acres in size.Many farms extend this  
 by renting additional land which is   
 available in the area.For example,one 
 larger than average farm boosts its   
 acreage to almost 250 acres by renting
 80-100 extra acres of land.           
     The average herd size is somewhere
 between 75-100 cows per farm.As is the
 case in most dairying areas of the    
 British Isles,the herds have comprised
 mainly of British Friesians.Today,    
 whilst this is still largely the case,
 more and more farmers are introducing 
 the British Holstein into their herds.
 In fact,another favourite of the      
 farmer's in this area is the Friesian-
 Holstein cross.This is,in the main,   
 simply because of the high milk yields
 produced by these particular breeds.
