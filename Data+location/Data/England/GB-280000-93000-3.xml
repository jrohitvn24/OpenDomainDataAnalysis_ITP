		<content> The community originated north west of
 the more modern expanding village. The
 old settlement nestling around the    
 Parish Church of St Mary is separate  
 and distinct from the linear          
 development which spreads along the   
 old 'A.30'.                           
                                       
 This is now by-passed by a dual       
 carriageway which forms the trunk road
 into Cornwall and carries the bulk of 
 the heavy and holiday traffic.        
                                       
 Several 'B' roads radiate from        
 Tedburn, one of the most notable being
 to the old market town of Crediton.   
 Another was the one time main route to
 Exeter which the coaches on the Exeter
 to Okehampton run used and which      
 followed the ridges of the hills      
 through the village of Whitestone.
