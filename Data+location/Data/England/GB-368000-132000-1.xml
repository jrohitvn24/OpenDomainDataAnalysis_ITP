		<title>01Summary of the area.</title>
		<content>  This area mainly consists of the town
 of Bruton and the community of        
 Redlynch.  It is largely an industrial
 area, although there is a certain     
 amount of light industry, which is    
 based around the station.  Recent     
 proposals have included the           
 development of various types of       
 light industry, with the              
 provision of small industrial         
 units. Based in the town is a firm of 
 agricultural hauliers, as well as a   
 mill, which supplies agricultural     
 food, fertilisers and seeds.  This    
 mill is called   {Sheldon Jones.}     
 Besides the actual shops of Bruton, a 
 large amount of the area is taken-up  
 with the buildings that comprise      
 King's School.  The river Brue runs   
 through the area, which until recently
 was prone to serious flooding; the new
 dam should have stopped this.         </content>
