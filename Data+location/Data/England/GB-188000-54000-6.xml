		<content> Children have been taught in the      
 village school for about 100 years. It
 is a small building on the edge of the
 village,built when different          
 conditions applied,right by the side  
 of the A:30 trunk road.Heavy vehicles 
 now roar past and the window facing   
 the road has been protected.The       
 pavement outside the school is edged  
 by strong metal railings and the      
 movement of pupils is carefully       
 controlled by teachers and a lollipop 
 lady.The wall top is also wired to    
 prevent children climbing over to     
 retrieve lost balls.                  
 There are about 80 children under the 
 age of 11 at the school with 4        
 teachers,1 caretaker,1 secretary and 3
 cooks.For their Secondary Education   
 they transfer to Newquay Treviglas    
 School.This means a journey from the  
 village of about 6  miles each day.   </content>
