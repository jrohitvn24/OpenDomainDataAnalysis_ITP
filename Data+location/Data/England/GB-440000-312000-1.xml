		<title>01Coalville Introduction...</title>
		<content>{   Coalville}was born as an industrial
 town 150 years ago on the site of Long
 Lane. It originally started as a      
 railway station on the Leicester to   
 Swannington Railway and developed     
 through it being a transport centre   
 for the coalmining, brickmaking,      
 engineering and quarrying industries  
 in the area.                          
   In the last five years{Coalville}has
 changed more than ever before. The    
 pit at Snibstone closed in 1984.      
   There is no longer any brickmaking  
 and very little engineering industry  
 left. Only the quarry for sand        
 extraction is still working fully.    
   In the centre of{Coalville}stands   
 the{Clock Tower.}This is situated in  
 Memorial Square in remembrance of the 
 soldiers who died in the Two World    
 Wars.
