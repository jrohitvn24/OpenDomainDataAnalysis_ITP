		<content>Fighting Cocks shopping area serves a  
small part of south Wolverhampton.  It 
is about two kilometres from the town  
centre aand there is a dense population
in the area.                           
There are thirteen shops.  Some sell   
basic goods like the butcher, grocer   
and baker.  There are two ladies shops,
a hairdresser and a clothes shop.      
There are two take aways, a fish and   
chip shop and a Chinese.  Also there   
are two pubs and a club.               
The shops are on a junction of two main
roads.  These roads are very busy and  
there are traffic lights at the        
junction.  The traffic makes shopping  
difficult and it can be dangerous to   
cross the road.  There are two bus     
stops and when people are getting on   
and off the buses it holds the trafffic
up.  It would be useful if there was a 
car park but there is no room.         </content>
