		<content> In 1840 three hundred cottages were   
 built by the G.W.R for their workers. 
 These cottages were tiny,with 2 or 3  
 small bedrooms,a livingroom and a     
 kitchen.There was no bathroom and the 
 toilet was outside in the yard. Food  
 could be cooked on an iron stove      
 heated with coal,and water had to be  
 fetched in.These cottages were        
 modernised in 1980 and provide limited
 but stylish accommodation.They are a  
 lasting memorial to the G.W.R.        
{Railway Museum.                       
 The museum is housed in what was the  
 G.W.R.barracks,which was accommodation
 for single men.In 1890 it became a    
 Wesleyan chapel until 1962.Today it   
 houses engines like North Star and    
 City of Truro. There is a huge copper 
 coffee pot in the shape of an engine  
 made for Queen Victoria which produced
 nasty tasting coffee.                 </content>
