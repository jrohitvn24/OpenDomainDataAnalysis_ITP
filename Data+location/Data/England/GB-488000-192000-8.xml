		<content>{Penn Village:}Across the road from the
{Crown Inn}there is a monument that was
 a tribute to the men who died in the  
 first world war. The original stocks  
 were by the old Elm tree which is near
 the monument. There is a farm called  
{Puttenham Place Farm}which is over 500
 years old.Henry the VIII had lots of  
 wives and Catherine stayed at         
{Puttenham Place Farm. Penn Village    
 merges with{Tylers Green}Village.It is
 called{Tylers Green}because tiles were
 made there and the roofs of the houses
 are made from Clay tiles. In 1796     
{Edmund Burke}used a house in a field, 
 since called{French school meadow,}as 
 a school for fatherless children from 
 the French Revolution.The names of the
 woods are{Chipping,Common, Brook,     
{Pughs, Vicarage, Twichels and Larches.
