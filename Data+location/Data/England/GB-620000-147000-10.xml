		<title>10Transport in the Barham area</title>
		<content>Black Robin was a local highwayman,    
who was eventually caught and hanged at
the site of the present crossroads on  
the A2.This road is one of the oldest  
in England(Roman). Henry 8th camped    
beside it en-route to France to meet   
Catherine of Aragon.During the short   
life of the Elham Valley Railway,the   
B2065 was less important.Now it is the 
only link between villages in the      
valley.The bus service(617)began in    
1921,running twice a day both ways.Now 
on week days 7 buses travel each way.  
The A2 is well serviced with buses     
going from Canterbury to Dover and     
Folkestone(via Denton).There is no bus 
service for Womenswold and Woolage     
Green.The car is the most popular      
method of transport and the majority   
of people work outside the area.Being  
a main route from Dover to London,the  
A2 is busiest in holiday periods.      </content>
