		<title>05The Forge</title>
		<content>    The forge in Daglingworth village  
 has been there for many years.        
    The two blacksmiths who work there 
 are brothers.  The tools they use     
 are very much the same as those which 
 have been used for centuries past.    
    In the past the blacksmiths used to
 do ornamental work but now they are   
 too busy shoeing horses to do any     
 thing else.                           
    People who live near by can bring  
 their horses to the forge but most of 
 the farrier's work is done near the   
 stables where the horses live. They   
 are mainly hunters, children's ponies 
 and polo ponies.                      
    Daglingworth farriers are so       
 skilled that they were chosen by the  
 Sultan of Brunei to teach his people  
 how to shoe polo ponies.
