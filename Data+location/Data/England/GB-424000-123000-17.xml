		<title>17Local Industry Whiteparish</title>
		<content> Basically Whiteparish is a rural area,
 but there are some small businesses   
 which are worth noting. The oldest is 
 the{saddler's - see page 6 for details
{The car body repair shop}has been     
 extensively updated just this year.   
 It now has a low bake oven using      
 Acrylic paints &amp; resprays are done in 
 about half the time previously taken. 
 The paint mixing plant itself cost    
 about Â£4000, so this represented a    
 major outlay for the two man business.
{Lascar Electronics}assembles small    
 components to produce Digital Panel   
 Instruments for electronics engineers.
 18 people are employed by this firm   
 which came to the village in January  
 1983. The site was used for many years
 as a Wilts. County Council Central    
 Kitchen for schools in the area,      
 although Whiteparish school has always
 had its own kitchen.                  </content>
