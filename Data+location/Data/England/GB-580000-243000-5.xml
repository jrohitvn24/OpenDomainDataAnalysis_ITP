 with apse and round tower, beside the

   On the high ground 1.5km away - the 
 village. A four-cottage terrace, six  
 semidet. council houses, twelve modern
 bungalows, eight modern detatched     
 houses, former chapel and manse, large
 Old Rectory with Tower (a folly and   
 landmark, memorial to the Rev. Bull).

   Paine's Manor and Bower Hall, Tudor.
   The Pinkuah Arms - or The Pinkers -

 publican doesn't know its meaning.    
 George is probably a descendant of the
 Kempe family - big C17 tomb in church.</content>
