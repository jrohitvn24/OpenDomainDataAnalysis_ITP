		<title>17Wootton Residential Visit</title>
		<content>In May 1985,twelve school children     
went on a residential visit to Weston- 
Super-Mare.We travelled down by        
mini-bus.On the way we stopped at      
Bibury,and the Roman town Cirencester. 
At Weston we stayed at the Sandy Lodge 
Hotel.We visited lots of interesting   
places.We went to see a lifeboat       
station,as well as seeing Cheddar Gorge
we also saw the caves at Wookey Hole   
which were formed over one million     
years ago.                             
We also saw the Roman Baths in         
Bath(Aquae Sulis).Visits were also made
to Bristol Zoo and the S.S. Great      
Britain.The weather was fine and       
everyone enjoyed themselves.
