		<title>03Peak Dale's Cheeky Monkey</title>
		<content>  On the side of the house which I live
 in (on Batham Gate Road) there is a   
 stone monkey.If you ever come up      
 Batham Gate Road,just near the top of 
 the hill is a row of houses -it is on 
 the house nearest to the road.I think 
 it was put there when the house was   
 built.                                
  We get lots of people taking photos  
 of the white monkey.We wondered why   
 they were doing this.One day there was
 a man taking photos.My mum asked why  
 he was doing this and he told my mum  
 all about it.                         
  What happened was that the man who   
 lived in the house when it was first  
 built went bankrupt.In those days when
 you were bankrupt you had to put a    
 white monkey on your house,and you    
 wouldn't be trusted any more.
