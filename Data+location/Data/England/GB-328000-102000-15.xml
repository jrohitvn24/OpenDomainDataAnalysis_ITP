		<title>15CHURCHILL</title>
		<content> Churchill is similar to Alston as it  
 is also a Hamlet.Also in Churchill    
 there are several farms, and again the
 strip fields were changed into several
 big fields.There are several small    
 lanes which the tractors go up and    
 down,every day.In Churchill there are 
 cottages renovated for retired        
 people.There are also some            
 Bungalows.We have no knowledge as to  
 why Churchill was called Churchill,but
 it may have originated from an        
 important man named Churchill who     
 owned the land there.
