		<content>Many tourists visit this area.  In     
Kersey there are the Weavers' Houses.  
Also in this area we have the site of  
Lindsey Castle of which only earth     
works remain.  However the Chapel of   
St.James, an ancient monument, is still
in excellent repair, though altered    
through time and use.  The nearby      
Church at Lindsey has many mediaeval   
features.  The Village of Kersey, only 
partly on this area is very much       
visited.  It is heavily parked at      
weekends and in the Summer holiday     
periods: Kersey and Lindsey woollens   
were historically famous and many      
thousands of visitors from the         
continent and from the United States,  
which itself has special historical    
ties with Suffolk, come here.          
The area is very accessible to the     
ports of Felixstowe and Harwich which  
have frequent ferries.                 </content>
