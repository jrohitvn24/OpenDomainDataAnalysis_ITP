		<title>03LIFESTYLE WICKLEWOOD MILL.</title>
		<content> Wicklewood boasts a very old windmill.
 The 140 year old mill was formally    
 handed over to the Norfolk Windmill   
 Trust in 1980 by its owner, Mrs.      
 Edwards.The restoration has cost over 
 Â£20 000 and has been carried out by   
 Mr. John Lawn. He began work on the   
 main beams and floors in 1978. He     
 built a new cap, frame and fantail in 
 his workshop at Caston mill, and      
 supervised the lifting of the eight   
 ton structure on to the mill. Now, in 
 1985, the Trust are replacing the     
 stocks and sails . It is soon hoped to
 replace the shutters and have the mill
 in working order.
