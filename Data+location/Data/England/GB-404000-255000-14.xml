		<title>14 The Ravenhall's Cottage</title>
		<content>  The Ravenhall family have lived in   
 Wysteria Cottage' for six years,but   
the cottage was actually built about   
four hundred years ago .               
  Since they have lived there, they    
have made a few necessary alterations. 
  They have had the walls and floor    
lowered so that the ceiling is the     
correct height for the beams.They have 
had damp proof course injected into the
walls,central heating put in,and have  
added an extension at the back of the  
cottage.The cottage was built on       
flagstones and there are still traces  
of Wattle and Daub in the walls.In the 
lounge there is a split beam where     
Mr.Ravenhall thinks an inglenook used  
to stand.                              
  The Marquis of Hertford used to own  
all the houses in  area,and the person 
who used to live in Wysteria Cottage' 
used to work the land for him.         </content>
