		<title>13CHIPSTABLE VICAR INTERVIEWED</title>
		<content>     We went to the Vicarage at        
 Chipstable, to talk to Mr Balchin, the
 rector of the combined parishes of    
 Chipstable, Raddington, Huish         
 Champflower and Clatworthy.           
     On a typical Sunday, the parish   
 priest might take a service at eight  
 thirty in Chipstable church, another  
 at Clatworthy church at ten, a third  
 at Huish at eleven o'clock and then on
 to Raddington for a service at three. 
     There are not many baptisms, or   
 weddings in the Chipstable group of   
 churches, in all about four of each a 
 year. In fact the last wedding held in
 Raddington Church, about four years   
 ago, was the first for thirteen years.
     Mr Balchin said that the nice     
 thing about being a country parson is 
 that the vicar knows everybody in the 
 parish, and they all know him. There  
 were no holiday homes, or commuters.  </content>
