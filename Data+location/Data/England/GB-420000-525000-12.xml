 children attend this school, and a    
 further 140 attend Jubilee Infants    
 school,which shares the same site,and 
 was built in 1976.Present LEA.        
 proposals are to amalgamate the 2     
 schools to form a new C.E.Aided school
 in July 1986.All Saints' CE.(Cont)    
 school has 120 pupils aged 4-11, and  
 was built in 1875 next to All Saints' 
 church. LEA.proposals are to close    
 this school in July 1986,but the local
 community,which strongly supports the 
 school,have set up an Action Group and

 others with some success. The outcome 
 of the future of the school is still  
 not decided.
