		<content> During Ascot Week the Queen and other 
 members of the Royal Family ride      
 down,every day,from Windsor Castle    
 through Windsor Great Park to Ascot   
 Race Course in open topped,horse drawn
 carriages.                            
 First came the butlers and maids,then 
 after five minutes we saw the Royal   
 Procession.At its head was the Queen  
 and Prince Philip,closely followed by 
 the Queen Mother,Princess Diana and   
 Prince Charles.In the next carriage   
 came the Duke and Duchess of Kent and 
 Princess Margaret.                    
 It took two minutes for the Procession
 to pass as they carried on their way  
 to the Race Course.
