		<title>16Living in Catthorpe</title>
		<content>   Life in the 1980's for most people  
 consists of working outside their     
 community and returning in the evening
 for the main meal of the day with the 
 rest of the family.This applies to    
 most of the people in Catthorpe.      
   There is a distinct lack of         
 entertainment,so a group has formed   
 called "The Friendly Three" (Catthorpe
 Swinford and Shawell) which organise  
 shopping trips and social outings for 
 the people of the villages.           
   There is no school in Catthorpe,so  
 the local authority arrange for a bus 
 to take school-age children to        
 Swinford (their nearest school.)      
   The local public house-"The Cherry  
 Tree"- offers limited entertainment   
 for those who are 18+,but youngsters  
 under 18 have to organise their own   
 entertainment at youth clubs etc. in  
 neighbouring villages.                </content>
