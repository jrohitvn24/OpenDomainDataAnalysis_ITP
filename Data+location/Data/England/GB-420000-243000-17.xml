 On{Mayday}(see p.8 FOLK CUSTOMS IN    
 ILMINGTON),just after the First World 
 War the children of the village were  
 gathered at school to choose a boy and
 a girl who were given the titles of   
{May King}and{May Queen}of Ilmington.  
 Then they danced around the{Maypole}  
 and sang songs.                       
 As there were few vehicles the        
 children used to play games in the{   
{streets}.Their games were hoops,      
 hopscotch, marbles and rounders (using
 the hand to hit the ball with).       
 Once a year the{June Club}had a fair  
 with ginny horses by the Howard Arms  
 and swinging boats by the Red Lion.In 
 October of each year a{pigroast}was   
 held by the Red Lion and a fete was   
 held in Middle Meadow grounds.Of all  
 these events and activities only{May  
{Day}is still celebrated.              </content>
