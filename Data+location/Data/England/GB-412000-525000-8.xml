		<title>08Visit To A Farm</title>
		<content> A group of us visited a local farm in 
 our area and questioned the farmer,Mr.
 Bowman.He told us that he owned 100   
 acres of land and that his farm was a 
 dairy farm.He has a herd of cows most 
 of which were fresian,but some were   
 crossed with a hereford breed,totaling
 about 90 cows in all.He told us that  
 the farms in the area were all dairy  
 because the soil was very poor.He said
 that the only thing which is grown is 
 hay because there is not enough       
 topsoil to grow good crops and under  
 the topsoil it is heavy clay.         
 His day begins at 6-00 a.m. when they 
 milk the cows.They finish about 8-00  
 a.m. ,then have breakfast.During the  
 rest of the morning they do jobs in   
 the fields such as mending fences or  
 cutting hay.After lunch they carry on 
 with the field jobs until they milk   
 the cows again at tea time.           </content>
