		<title>15Birdwatch In Cleobury</title>
		<content>  In my garden are many birds. In the  
 trees are nuthatches and treecreepers.
 In a big beech tree are tawny owls and
 little owls. Blue tits and great tits 
 nest in our birdboxes. Long-tailed    
 tits and coal tits also visit. We see 
 goldfinches, chaffinches and          
 bullfinches and have some nesting     
 greenfinches. Nesting are thrushes and
 blackbirds and, in our grape vine, a  
 spotted flycatcher. I think that some 
 goldcrests are nesting somewhere near 
 by. Starlings nest in our roof and    
 sparrows, dunnocks and robins eat our 
 rabbit food. Mallards and crows fly   
 overhead, also swifts, swallows and   
 house martins. Magpies pester the     
 crows and rooks. In winter male and   
 female blackcaps come. Last winter    
 five fieldfares and thirty redwings   
 came. In the trees near our pond is a 
 great spotted woodpecker.             </content>
