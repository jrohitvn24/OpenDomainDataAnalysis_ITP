		<title>11ORMSKIRK MARKET</title>
		<content> Ormskirk Market is held every Thursday
 and Saturday unless Christmas day     
 falls on one of those days. There are 
 141 stalls most of which have been    
 there over ten years. There is a      
 waiting list which indicates it's     
 popularity with traders.              
   The food market is now held on a car
 park but the non food stalls still    
 form a street market in Aughton and   
 Moor streets.Pedestrianisation has    
 made shopping safer but some of the   
 stall holders think that some of the  
 character of the market has been lots.
   A survey of 86 shoppers revealed    
 that most lived in or near to         
 Ormskirk, had travelled by car or had 
 walked to the market. Most had come to
 buy fresh food and vegetables.        
   In summer, the market is a tourist  
 attraction with special buses being   
 laid on from Southport.               </content>
