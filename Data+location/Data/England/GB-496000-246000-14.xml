		<title>14Road Traffic,Local Concern</title>
		<content> In 1984 the a 422 had an average daily
 traffic flow of 7670 vehicles,12.5% of
 these were heavy goods vehicles.It    
 also had an accident rate much higher 
 than other principal roads in the     
 county.A By-Pass for Bromham on the A 
 428 is currently under construction   
 and on completion,it is felt          
 locally,will mean that traffic will   
 reach Stagsden village travelling much
 faster trhan at present, despite the 2
 bends at the centre.A By-Pass for     
 Stagsden is proposed for 1989/90.The  
 public were consulted on 4 possible   
 routes.The 2 northern routes meant    
 loss of much agricultural land, Bird  
 Gardens and severance of the          
 community.53% of the public favoured  
 the southern route (the selected      
 route),which also took less           
 agricultural land and had less impact 
 on the countryside.                   </content>
