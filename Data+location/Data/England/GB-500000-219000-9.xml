		<content>   Queensbury Upper School operates on 
 a 2 week timetable:_ that is to say we
 only get each particular lesson once a
 fortnight. This Tuesday is in week one
 of the timetable.                     
   I arrived at school by coach at 8.45
 am. I travel by coach from Caddington,
 which is three miles away, so I get   
 free  transport. At 8.50 am we went   
 upstairs for registration room. At    
 9.00 lessons began. Queensbury is in  
 two blocks, East and West, and we have
 different lessons in different blocks.
 Today my first lesson was Latin with  
 Mr. Getter in East, followed by latin 
 with Miss Bridge.                     
   At 1.45pm afternoon lessons begin.  
 Today we had maths and English in the 
 west and east. School ends at 3.45am. 
 Afterwards we went home again.
