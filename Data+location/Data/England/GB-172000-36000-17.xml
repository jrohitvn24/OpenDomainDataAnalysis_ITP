		<title>17Living in Ponsanooth.</title>
		<content> Most people that live in Ponsanooth   
 work somwhere else such as Falmouth,  
 Truro or Redruth. A lot of old people 
 live here in bungalows specially      
 adapted to suit them. Some of the     
 people are as old as 91.              
 It is a friendly village and everyone 
 gets on well together. We have        
 recently acquired a new playing field 
 which the old folk are not very       
 pleased about because it is next to   
 their back gardens.The Ponsanooth     
 garden show is  judged every year and 
 the produce is auctioned for          
 charity. There are dog training       
 lessons at the Methodist Hall which   
 are well attended because there is    
 little else to do. Most people travel 
 out of the village if they want       
 entertainment such as sports, the     
 cinema or the beach.
