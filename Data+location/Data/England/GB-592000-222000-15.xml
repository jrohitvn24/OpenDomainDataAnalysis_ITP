		<title>15PINK COTTAGE FOXES</title>
		<content>  Five years ago, the lady of Copford  
 Pink Cottage took home a{fox cub}and  
 hand reared it. The{vixen}was friendly
 and when older was put in a small run 
 with a hut with earth to dig and      
 scratch in. It escaped on occasions   
 but always returned. After a long     
 disappearence, it must have mated for 
 it returned and each night took lots  
 of food and eventually brought some   
 cubs for the lady to see. It returned 
 to nature and was killed by a dog.    
  Since then she has kept two other    
 cubs, one of which liked to play with 
 her dogs although it was never        
 domesticated.                         
  The{local hunt}meets at the Alma pub 
 nearby and the lady deliberately puts 
 them off the scent with her "special  
 potion"
