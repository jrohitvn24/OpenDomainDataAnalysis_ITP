		<content> There are few facilities in the area. 
 Most people have to travel three or   
 more miles to find the nearest doctor,
 dentist, hospital or large shop. There
 is a flourishing   community life for 
 those who wish to take part.          
   Warninglid is situated in the south 
 west of our area around a crossroad.  
 It is a peaceful village with a       
 population of mixed ages which is     
 remaining stable. There is a pub, a   
 school but no shops and for some older
 people transport is a problem.A bus   
 runs every 2 hours.                   
   Slaugham is a quiet village enclosed
 by farmland. Most of the houses are   
 old and situated along the high       
 street.There is a church, a pub and   
 two lakes. There are two interesting  
 objects in Slaugham_a white telephone 
 box and an old water pump outside the 
 former post office.                   </content>
