		<content>{#1  }Often Kylie and me play          
{'Leapfrog'}with the boys.  The rules  
 are you have two teams and one team   
 has to try and tig the other.  When   
 you are caught you have to crouch down
 and other people in your team can jump
 over you and free you.  There is a den
 for the people which have to be       
 caught, they are called 'runners'.    
                                       
{#2  }My favourite playground game is  
{'British Bulldog'. }The rules are that
 you must get to the other end of the  
 playground to free the people who have
 been caught.  Then we have to get back
 to the other end.  There are two      
 people 'on' and they have to pick a   
 person to get to the other end and    
 then they have to try to catch that   
 person.
