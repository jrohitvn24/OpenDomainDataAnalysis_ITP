		<content>   In the past, many people worked     
{outside}the area especially in{London.
   In recent years, the re-location of 
 City firms, the building of the M25   
 motorway &amp; the continued rapid        
 expansion of Gatwick airport has      
 resulted in the{growth of light       
{industry}in the area.                 
   Furthermore, much{office            
{accommodation}has been &amp; is being     
 built, often involving a change in    
 land use.  As this area is already    
 congested, this is causing{traffic    
{problems}which are likely to get      
 worse.  It is also altering the       
 appearance of the town centres, not   
 always favourably.                    
  {Unemployment}is{low-around 5%. }It  
 continues to be one of the fastest    
 growing parts of the country with good
 communications, lovely countryside &amp;  
 desirable residential areas.          </content>
