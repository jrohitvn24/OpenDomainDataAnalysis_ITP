  The outdoor games we play are mostly 
 played at school. People like to play 
 tennis,rounders and football.The most 
 popular game that I know of is        
 rounders.                             
         {Rounders                     
  The game rounders is played with four
 posts,one bowler and two equal teams. 
 One team bats and the other team      
 fields.                               
  There are lots of other games such as
{skipping, cricket}and{netball}also    
 many other games.Some people play     
 leap frog, hide and seek and block    
 1.2.3.                                
  Tennis can be played with four people
 but most people play with two.There   
 is a net in the middle,the players hit
 a ball from one side to then other.
