 The old Parish Hall, were most of the 
 clubs are held, used to be an old     
 galvanized shed on the ground were Mr.
 John Ashley now has his bungalow.     
    Captain R.C.D. Owen Plas Yn Grove  
 gave the playing fields to the village
 so a new Parish Hall was built for    
 Christmas 1960                        
   The basic structure of the Village  
 Hall was an ex-army building with a   
 new brick Wark Shell built around it. </content>
