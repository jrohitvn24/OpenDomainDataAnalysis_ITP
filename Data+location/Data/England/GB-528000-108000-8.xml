		<title>08TRAFFIC FLOW SURVEY</title>
		<content>  We surveyed 2 roads.London road is   
 a main road used for long distance and
 through traffic.Mackie avenue is a    
 surburban road with local traffic     
 going to and from Patcham.            
  The time the counts were done were   
 1:45-2:15pm(London rd) and            
 2:40-3:10pm(Mackie av).There were 1418
 vehicles per hour on the London rd at 
 what was expected to be a quiet time  
 .The Brighton by-pass is being built  
 to reduce the amount of traffic going 
 through Brighton.There were many      
 lorries mostly Northbound because they
 came from the South Coast ports.      
  Mackie Avenue had 262 vehicles per   
 hour with no lorries as there is no   
 destination for them on a housing     
 estate.The traffic is light as it is  
 only local.The London rd divides our  
 survey area into 2 and has a major    
 influence on the Patcham area.        </content>
