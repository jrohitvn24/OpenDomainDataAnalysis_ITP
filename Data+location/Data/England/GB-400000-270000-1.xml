		<title>01Introduction to D Block</title>
		<content> This block is predominantly rural and 
 contains six sizeable farms.The only  
 settlement is that of Alvechurch in   
 the northern section.The main road is 
 the A441 linking Alvechurch to        
 Birmingham and Redditch,and the other 
 three roads are C class.The centre of 
 the block is cut by the Birmingham to 
 Worcester canal,and by the Redditch to
 Birmingham railway.The undulating     
 nature of the  land adds to its       
 general isolation.There is a marked   
 absence of industry,and one twelfth of
 the area is covered by woodland mainly
 deciduous,and the remainder by        
 farmland,and most of this is grassland
 used for pasture,and for cutting as   
 grass,silage or hay.
