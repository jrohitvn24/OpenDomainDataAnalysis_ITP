 makes interesting though grim history 
 and today there stands on a rising    
 hill opposite the Manor House a large 
 wooden cross, known as the Matyrs     
 Cross in remembrance and honour of    
 those who had connections with        
 Chideock and who died for their       
 faith. The richly decorated church is 
 Romanesque in design and particularly 
 rich in relics.                       
    A Non_Conformist church is to be   
 found on the S.W. side of Hardown     
 Hill.This is used for services and    
 forms part of the original old village
 of Morcombelake. Abutting onto the    
 church and connected with it there is 
 a village hall which is used for      
 village meetings e.g. Womens Institute
 and The Hardown Society. A small old  
 graveyard adjoins the church.
