		<content>      On Friday morning I got up and   
 got dressed and packed my picnic and  
 had my breakfast. Then I came to      
 school. We left about 10 O'clock. It  
 was quite wet but we went. We saw lots
 of{hillsides.}We had to climb over    
 lots of{stiles,}there were lots of    
{footpaths.}We went through some{hop   
{fields.}Halfway we got very thirsty so
 we stopped for a quick drink then we  
 went on. We saw{quite a view from the 
{hills.}I found{lots of cartridges.}We 
 had to collect yellow bits of paper   
 each one was worth a house point. Then
 we stopped for lunch-I had a nice     
 lunch of a drink,an apple,crisps,dolly
 mixtures and sandwiches. I liked our  
 walk a lot. I found a{birds egg.}We   
 went over the{motorway bridge}and then
 we went back to school then we went   
 home.
