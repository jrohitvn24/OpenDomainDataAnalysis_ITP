		<content> Karen's grandmother went to school in 
 Ashington between l9l9 and l928.  Her 
 first memory of school was teaching a 
 boy to knit in the infants school. In 
 her last year her main subjects were  
 reading, writing, arithmetic,         
 scripture, history &amp; geography.  These
 were taught by the same teacher, a    
 common feature of schooling before the
 second world war.  Work was done in   
 exercise books with a pencil.         
 Practical work consisted of needlework
 and drawing.{Punishments}were severe -
 the{strap and tawse. }There were no   
 audio-visual aids for teachers ie.    
 radio, TV &amp; films. There were no      
 school visits. Her favourite lesson   
 was needlework the least enjoyable    
 was history.  She did not like        
 learning about events l00 years before
{School meals}were not provided &amp;      
 pupils wore their own clothes for PE. </content>
