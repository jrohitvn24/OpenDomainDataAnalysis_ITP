		<title>17PADSTOW SCOUT TROOP</title>
		<content> Padstow Scout Troop has just been     
 reformed this year after an absence of
 10 years.We meet on Tuesdays between 7
 and 9 and it costs 30p a week.At the  
 moment there are only enough boys to  
 have two patrols, Kingfisher and      
 Beaver,I am in Kingfisher.            
 Recently we have been learning how to 
 build camp fires{and we are only      
{allowed to use one match each!}Once we
 have got our fires going we have      
 barbecues on them.We have built{aerial
{runways}and the first time we used    
 them one of our gang crashed into a   
 tree - luckily not hurting himself.   
 Some of the boys have been going      
 across to Par beach to learn how to   
 canoe,but you have to be a good       
 swimmer first before you are allowed  
 in the canoes.We go camping with other
 troops in the District and we hope to 
 have our own camp later in the summer.</content>
