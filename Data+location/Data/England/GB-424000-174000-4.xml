		<title>04LIFE ON THE LAND</title>
		<content> Our farms vary from large arable to   
 small mixed holdings matched to the   
 downlands where most have areas of    
 grassland carrying 7 beef, 5          
 dairying, 2 sheep and 2 pig herds.    
 Modern methods allow pig slurry to be 
 pumped to distant fields as natural   
 fertilizer. One farmer has an aircraft
 and another has dug a pond to         
 encourage the return of wildfowl.     
 There are many lovely views and       
 ancient sites in the fields. Farmers  
 worry about capital investment and    
 returns. But they almost all seem to  
 enjoy their life: hospitable and ready
 to help each other out, sons seem     
 to follow their fathers into a way of 
 life. They may live rather isolated   
 lives in their houses and out in the  
 fields but they and their wives are   
 active in village life, welcoming     
 interest in their work                </content>
