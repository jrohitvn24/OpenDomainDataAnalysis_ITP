Quernmore and Littledale are in an area
of outstanding natural beauty.A little 
while ago a car park and picnic area   
were built so that people could enjoy  
the countryside.It leads to the Clougha
Access Area which is a path over the   
moors which people can walk on but it  
means they haven't to stray away from  
the path and they are not allowed to   
take dogs.During the grouse shooting   
season the access area is closed.Most  
of the moors are owned by the Duke of  
Westminster and he brings shooting     
parties from August 12th onwards.      
      During the war it was a training 
ground for the army and there is a     
notice which says "Beware of unexploded
shells.Do not touch.Report to Police." 
There haven't been any accidents in    
this area yet thank goodness.
