		<title>20SHOPPING</title>
		<content> Many people were interviewed about the
 shops in the area.Overall, the people 
 said that it was very lacking in all  
 types of shops and that it had got    
 worse as small shops had to close     
 down.Many people said a general store 
 would be very useful and that the town
 was too small to merit a supermarket, 
 also it would be too noisy. The shops 
 in Pleasley at the moment are a Post  
 Office,fish and chip shop, small      
 grocers shops, bric a brac shop, a    
 butchers shop, shortly to close down, 
 and a car spares shop.The shop that   
 the people seemed to need more was a  
 chemists shop. People seemed to think 
 that it was in order for the small    
 corner store to charge more for items 
 than the large supermarkets because   
 they had to. Otherwise they culd not  
 compete and would have to close down.
