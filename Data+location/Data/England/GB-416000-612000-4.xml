		<title>04ALNWICK CASTLE</title>
		<content> The castle was built in Norman        
 times. The area of the castle is 3,750
 metres, that is the length and width  
 of the castle.  During the Scottish   
 War of Independence in the 14th       
 century the Percys became lords of    
 Alnwick, the castle gained greatly in 
 strength and importance.  Today most  
 of the castle is open to people.  You 
 have to pay a small fee to get in.    
 There are many suits of armour and a  
 stage coach and there is an old       
 betting table.  My favourite place in 
 the castle is the weaponry room.      
 American students that come from the  
 State called Minnesota stay here to   
 study.  This has made Alnwick quite a 
 bit more special.  Another thing about
 the castle is the dungeons underneath.
 The Guest Hall is used for special    
 times _ some of them are dances,      
 concerts, plays and large events.     </content>
