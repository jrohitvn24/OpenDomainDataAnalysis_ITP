		<title>02HANDICAPPED SPORTS CENTRE</title>
		<content> This sports centre is special because 
 it is for disabled as well as able-   
 bodied people. It was the dream of Len
 Tasker, himself disabled. A disused   
 warehouse was bought and it cost      
 Â£400,000 to transform it. The money   
 was raised by funds and donations,    
 with one donation of Â£10 coming from  
 as far away as the Bahamas. The centre
 was opened on October 25th 1984.      
 Inside there is a gymnasium equipped  
 with a variety of special equipment.  
 In two other large halls there are    
 facilities for archery, cricket,      
 badminton, table tennis, pool,        
 trampolining and gymnastics. In the   
 snooker room one table is especially  
 designed so it can be used easily by  
 people in wheelchairs. The most       
 expensive part of the sports centre   
 for the disabled is the indoor bowling
 green which cost Â£22,000 to complete. </content>
