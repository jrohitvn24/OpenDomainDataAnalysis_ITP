		<title>19LIGHT INDUSTRY IN GOMSHALL</title>
		<content>   Five of us went to visit Gomshall   
 Tannery on the A25 just over a mile   
 from Shere. After we had found the    
 office we were taken around the       
 tannery. Three of the fathers in our  
 school work there.                    
   We saw the skins being washed and   
 dried. The skins are then died,       
 dried again, and stretched. There were
 many machines that were huge. It was  
 noisey and very busy. Suede and       
 leather skins are produced in 200     
 different colours. Each week 150,000  
 square feet of suede leather is made. 
 Altogether there are 300 people       
 employed in the tannery.              
   There are only two other tanneries  
 in England. When the skins are ready  
 they are packed into boxes and sent   
 all over the world. The boxes are     
 taken by lorry to ports and airports  
 in England. Many skins go to Italy.   </content>
