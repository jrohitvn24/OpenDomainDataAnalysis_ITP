		<content> Mrs. Wheildon continues her           
 recollections:                        
 "The Church has traditionally been the
 focus of rural life,but today things  
 are changing.Church fetes,flower shows
 and harvest suppers are no longer the 
 focal point of village social life.The
 church at Butlers Marston is in danger
 of being closed,due to lack of        
 congregation and support.The Reverend 
 Wyatt comes every third Sunday from   
 Ettington and has three parishes to   
 care for,a practice becoming          
 increasingly common in rural parts.To 
 see such a beautiful and ancient      
 building,the most impressive in the   
 village lying idol and slowly decaying
 would be a shame indeed.There are just
 a few stalwarts left to clip the      
 churchyard and keep the church clean, 
 but there is no choir and the bells   
 are silent,perhaps for ever."         </content>
