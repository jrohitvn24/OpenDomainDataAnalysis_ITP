		<title>01ASPULL AND NEW SPRINGS</title>
		<content>The area known as Aspull and New       
Springs,is an area to the North and    
East of the township of Wigan in       
Lancashire. This block also contains   
parts of Higher Ince and Hindley.      
Historically the area is one of        
the cradles of the Industrial          
Revolution A with a corner of the      
family estate of the Earl of           
Balcarres, now Haigh Hall country park 
at the North West Corner of the        
block,and the site of the Kirkless     
Iron Works at the western side of the  
block.                                 
     Aspull was a mining village and   
there are still mine shafts today.     
Many of the names of the pits have     
changed over the time. One of the      
original mine owners was called        
Woodshaw and we now have a reclaimed   
spoil heap called Woodshaws. There are 
rows of pit cottages in the village.   </content>
