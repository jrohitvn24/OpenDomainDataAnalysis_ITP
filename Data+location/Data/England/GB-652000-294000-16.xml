		<title>16LIFE IN OULTON VILLAGE-1930</title>
		<content>(Memories recalled by MR. Gordon       
Wilson, Oulton Village resident all his
life, and resident of Oulton Road for  
40 years.)                             
"The terraced houses in Oulton Broad   
were built in 1903. Our rent was 25 old
pence weekly. We had 4 shops, a        
dairy and 2 public houses in Oulton    
in those days. Today we have only 1    
shop, 1 post office store and 1 public 
house. On land where modern houses     
stand today there were orchards and    
open fields. Most people worked on the 
land and some were fishermen. They     
usually began work at the age of 14.My 
first job was at Decoy Farm, Flixton   
where I earned 14 shillings a week. A  
pint of milk was 2 old pence and 24    
eggs cost 5 pence in those days.       
Adults wore their working clothes all  
week and only changed into their best  
clothes on a Sunday."                  </content>
