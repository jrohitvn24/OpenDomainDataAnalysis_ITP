		<title>15SCOUT ACTIVITIES</title>
		<content> The Scout Hut is near the sewage works
 and belongs to the 5th Devonport      
 Scouts, of which I am a member. There 
 are about 55 cubs and 15 scouts. I am 
 a scout. Each year we go camping 2 or 
 three times. Soon I will be going on a
 survival camp for a weekend, where I  
 will have to live for two days and two
 nights with just a penknife and a     
 sheet of polythene with which to make 
 a bivouac to sleep in. The scouts meet
 between 1900 and 2100 on Friday       
 nights. On Saturdays there is a disco 
 at 1830. On Tuesdays between 1715 and 
 1830 we go swimming at HMS Drake,     
 which is a local Naval Base on the    
 River Tamar. On Saturday mornings we  
 often go to Blockhouse Park to play   
 five-a-side football. Some of the     
 other boys belong to Boys Brigade.    
 Girls can join Brownies or Guides or  
 Girls Brigade.                        </content>
