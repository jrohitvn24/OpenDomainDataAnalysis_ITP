		<content> THE LANDSCAPE OF OUR BLOCK CAN BE     
 DESCRIBED AS GENTLY ROLLING HILLSIDE  
 THAT IS PARTIALLY WOODED. ALTHOUGH    
 THERE ARE NOT ANY REALLY HIGH HILLS,  
 MOST OF THE ROADS AND PATHS IN OUR    
 BLOCK INVOLVE SOME INCLINES. WHEN WE  
 LOOKED AT SOME AERIAL PICTURES OF OUR 
 AREA WE COULD SEE CLEARLY THAT HOUSING
 DEVELOPMEMT HAD, GENERALLY, NOT       
 MADE MUCH IMPACT ON THE OVERALL       
 LANDSCAPE WHICH WAS CLEARLY STILL VERY
 MUCH DOMINATED BY FARMING.  THE       
 PICTURE HAD BEEN TAKEN IN THE SUMMER  
 TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO, AND SHOWED    
 THAT MUCH OF OUR AREA WAS UNDER       
 CULTIVATION USUALLY WITH GRAIN CROPS. 
 THIS YEAR IT WAS CLEAR THAT THERE WERE
 MORE MEADOWS BEING USED FOR GRAZING   
 BUT THERE WERE STILL SEVERAL LARGE    
 AREAS BEING USED FOR VARIOUS TYPES OF 
 CROPS.                                
                                       </content>
