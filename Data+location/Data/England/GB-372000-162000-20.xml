		<title>20THE ARCHITECTURE OF BATH</title>
		<content> THE CITY OF BATH IS FAMOUS THROUGHOUT 
 THE WORLD FOR ITS{GEORGIAN            
{ARCHITECTURE,}WHICH IS VERY BEAUTIFUL 
 AND ORNATE.                           
  THE GEORGIAN PERIOD INCORPORATES THE 
 THREE ORDERS OF GREEK ARCHITECTURE,   
 KNOWN AS DORIC, IONIC AND CORINTHIAN. 
 THE{DORIC}ORDER IS THE SIMPLEST IN    
 DESIGN AND VERY PLAIN, WHEREAS THE    
{IONIC}ORDER IS EASILY DEFINED BY THE  
 SCROLL AT THE TOP OF THE COLUMNS. THE 
 LATER STAGE,{CORINTHIAN,}IS THE MOST  
 ORNATE AND THE OBVIOUS FEATURE OF THE 
 PERIOD IS THE RICHLY CARVED CAPITALS  
 AT THE TOP OF THE COLUMNS.            
  A FINE EXAMPLE OF ALL THREE          
 ARCHITECTURAL ORDERS CAN BE SEEN TODAY
 AT{THE CIRCUS}IN BATH, WHICH WAS ONCE 
 CALLED THE ROYAL CIRCUS.              
  MY DAD RESTORES THESE SORTS OF       
 BUILDINGS. HE HAS TO SHAPE STONE TO   
 FIT IN WITH THE EXISTING STONE.       </content>
