		<content> The main part of the old Vicarage on  
 Church Lane,Chaplethorpe was built in 
 1780. In 1820 the staircase was moved 
 and corridors were put in. In 1903    
 there were some more alterations made 
 to the house adding a study and       
 recreation room. Some of the windows  
 are old Victorian styles. In the large
 garden there is a small pillar which  
 is chipped on the top and there is a  
 legend that underneath there is a box 
 with historical things in it. It only 
 became a vicarage in 1903 before that 
 it belonged to the Charlesworth family
 who once owned Chaplethorpe Hall.     
 The building materials used on the old
 Vicarage are mainly old Yorkshire     
 stone. Where the foundations of the   
 Study are you can see modern house    
 bricks. The main part of the house's  
 exterior has a kind of rough rendered 
 texture.                              </content>
