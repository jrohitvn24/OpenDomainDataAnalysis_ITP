		<title>11THE NICKY LINE</title>
		<content>  The name Nicky comes either from the 
 parish of St Nicholas which covers    
 much of Harpenden or because of its   
 size from the word knickerbocker.     
  It was a single track railway opened 
 in 1877 to link the Midland and       
 London, Midland Scotland railways.    
  It was never very successful         
 financially due to competition from   
 road transport.  An experiment using a
 'ro_railer' which could travel on both
 rails and roads did not attract the   
 extra passengers needed.              
  The line was closed to passengers in 
 1947 and used by a local Hemelite     
 Company to transport ash from         
 Harpenden to its brick company in     
 Hemel Hempstead.  The line was finally
 closed in 1979.  During 1983_4 the    
 track was taken up and a cycleway was 
 laid linking Redbourn and Harpenden,  
 as part of a Youth Opportunity Scheme.</content>
