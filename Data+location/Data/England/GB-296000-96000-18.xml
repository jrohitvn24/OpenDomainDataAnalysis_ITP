		<title>18WILD LIFE</title>
		<content>    I am doing a project on nature. The
 things that I will be doing are       
 animals,birds,flowers and trees.I will
 also be going to Clyst Vale Library to
 find reference books.We have four     
 acres of ground so we have a lot of   
 wildlife in it:wood pigeon, water     
 vole, foxes, deer, wood pecker,       
 cuckoo, mice, crows, moles and        
 butterflies.                          
            There are wild animals in  
 Britain, some of them are red foxes,  
 badgers, roe deer, hedgehogs, moles,  
 grey and red squirrels, rabbits, brown
 hares, wood mice, common shrews,      
 pheasants and short tailed voles.They 
 live in woods,long grass,hedgegrows   
 or swamp land .Wild animals are       
 frightened of people.                 
  In our garden we have seen the robin,
 thrush,wren, snipe, blackbird and     
 starling.                             </content>
