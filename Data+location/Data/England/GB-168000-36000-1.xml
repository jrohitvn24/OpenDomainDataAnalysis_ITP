{LANDSCAPE &amp;BUILDINGS.}                
 The area of Four Lanes is a plateau   
 which is dominated by the hill feature
 of{Carmenellis}which is 252m above    
 sea-level.This is on the southern edge
 of our area and gives a fine view for 
 miles. The landscape has a moorland   
 look but is mainly grassland of good  
 and {Croftlike}quality. The area is   
 one of many smallholdings quite widely
 scattered with small fields enclosed  
 by Cornish stone hedges.The farmhouses
 are small,mainly built of Cob.In Four 
 Lanes the older houses are miners     
 cottages mostly in terraces built in  
 granite.There are three post 1945 war 
 estates, two are mainly bungalows the 
 other is mainly council houses built  
 in the 1970's.The area is well served 
 by minor roads and is crisscrossed by 
 numerous lanes and tracks.            </content>
