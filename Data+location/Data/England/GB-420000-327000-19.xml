		<title>19Tutbury`s new Community Ctre</title>
		<content>Many people call it the "new Community 
centre" but the idea of having one     
isnÂ£t new at all.It all started in 1973
when a group of people came together   
with the idea of forming a new centre. 
Most of the money needed came from     
fetes,raffles and so on.There was even 
a "buy a brick" campaign in which      
everyone was asked to buy a brick.     
The centre is aimed at everyone,with   
sports and activities for all age      
groups.The position of the building is 
to be in Monk Street next to the Health
Centre,and is expected to open in 1986.
TUTBURY VILLAGE BANK                   
It is very unusual for a village the   
size of Tutbury to have its own bank.  
It has a bit of a garden where the bank
staff grow vegetables and fruit.This is
unusual for a bank too.There are about 
two thousand people banking there and  
there are about five thousands accounts</content>
