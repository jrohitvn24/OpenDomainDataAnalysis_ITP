		<title>12EDUCATION: A CHILDS VIEW</title>
		<content> In the Infants school we enjoyed      
 ourselves very much. The work was     
 quite simple. In Maths we did simple  
 addition and subtraction but it was   
 hard to us. In English we learnt about
 how to add different endings onto     
 words which we had learnt in the      
 second year Infants. At the end of the
 third year Infants we were all reading
 well and ready for our first year     
 Junior Class. This was quite a change 
 for us, as we needed our own writing  
 equipment but still wrote in pencil   
 and did printing. We got our first    
 computer whilst we were in this class.
 The years throughout the Juniors went 
 very quickly and before we knew it, it
 was the end of Primary School.In High 
 School we will do subjects like       
 languages, and all the children are   
 looking forward to going there in     
 1985.                                 </content>
