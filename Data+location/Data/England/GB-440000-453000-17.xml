 the people in the area have lived in  
 the country for all of their lives.A  
 lot of jobs in{Hunsingore}and

 church is in the centre of the village
 and its spire can be seen from miles  
 away because it is on a hill.The vicar
 no longer lives in the village.There  
 used to be a clock on the church which
 was built by{William Potts,}but it was
 moved on to a farm building at{Clock  
{Farm,}which is owned by{Patrick Dent.}
 There is a{village hall,}part of it is
 over 200 years old. Discos,dances,
