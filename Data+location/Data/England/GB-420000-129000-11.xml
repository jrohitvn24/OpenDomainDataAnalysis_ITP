		<title>11EVENTS IN FARLEY</title>
		<content> One of the events in the village is   
 the fete. It is held in the playing   
 fields. There is always a fete queen  
 and two attendants. Some of the stalls
 are the bottle stall, the raffle stall
 and more. There are competitions at   
 the fete and some are fancy dress,    
 cakes, painting, drawing and more.    
 Some adult competitions are flower    
 arrangment, knitted articles,         
 painting, photography and others.     
 There are quite a few side shows such 
 as bran tub, darts, hoop-la, coconut  
 shy, skittles and lots more.          
 The local pub, The Hook and Glove,    
 organises several events. One of these
 is a skittles evening when you can    
 win prizes.                           
 In June 1985 there was a week long    
 Festival. Every evening there was some
 musical entertainment in the church.  
 There was a Barn Dance on the Friday. </content>
