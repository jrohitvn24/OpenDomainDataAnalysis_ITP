		<content>   On Wednesday 8th May 1985 I woke up 
 at 7.15 a.m. I had my breakfast, then 
 I played on my{computer.}After that I 
 had my vitamin and flouride tablets   
 and went to{school}in the car. At     
 school I waited until the bell rang.  
 We did some English work first then   
 went to Assembly. After playtime we   
 finished our English and did one page 
 of Maths before lunch. I played on my 
 own until I went in for lunch, then   
 afterwards I played football. When the
 whistle blew I went to line up. In    
 class, Mrs. Jones told us about the   
 Domesday Project. After school I went 
 to{Chess}Club and played 3 games, then
 I waited for my Mum to take me home.  
 After tea I played with my Lego and   
 watched{television}until bedtime at   
 9.00 p.m.
