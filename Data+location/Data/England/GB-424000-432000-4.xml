		<content>    Farnley Hall is the headquarters of
 the Tong Cockersdale Countryside      
 Volunteers run by Bob Dawson, who is  
 countryside warden for the area. Money
 to run the scheme is provided by      
 Leeds, Bradford and West Yorkshire    
 Councils, with help from the          
 Countryside Commission. The scheme    
 employs volunteers from schools and   
 from the community as well as people  
 on Youth Training programmes. Tasks   
 include woodland management, footpath 
 maintenance,liaison with local farmers
 and landowners. The warden and his    
 team consider that educating the      
 public in the sensible use of the     
 countryside is an important aspect of 
 their work.                           
  The area of open country managed by  
 the TCCV lies partly within Farnley   
 and forms a green wedge between the   
 large urban areas of Leeds &amp; Bradford.</content>
