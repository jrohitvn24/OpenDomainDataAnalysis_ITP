		<content> He sells his fat bullocks for Â£600 to 
 Â£700.Mr Norman milks his cows twice   
 a day  but  some  farmers  milk  them 
 three times a day.He feeds his cows in
 winter on hay,sugarbeet and 16 percent
 protein cake.Mr Norman's bullocks eat 
 about 4,000 bales of hay and about    
 1,000 bales of straw each year.The hay
 takes up about 23 acres of land.To get
 the germs out of the milk he uses     
 detergent to clean off the udders and 
 he sterilizes the units at 75 degrees.
 Mr Norman has not got a bull he has   
 only got cows.British Friesians give  
 about 5 gallons of milk a day.        
   Mr Norman often has lambs which have
 lost their mothers and they are       
 fostered by other sheep or Mr Norman  
 looks after them.
