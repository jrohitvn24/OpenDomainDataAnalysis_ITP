		<title>03Wootton Parish Church</title>
		<content>In the centre of Wootton village lies  
the impressive parish church of St Mary
the Virgin.The church was built in the 
thirteenth century.At about 1237 the   
church was dedicated to Saint Mary the 
Virgin and the ceremony of its         
dedication is always held on September 
8.                                     
In the church there is a tablet        
commemorating the marrage on August 20 
1879 of the Victorian diarist Robert   
Francis Kilvert to Elizabath Anne      
Rowland of Holly Bank Wootton.The      
patrons of the church are New College  
Oxford.                                
The church is only a short distance    
from the village school.At Harvest and 
Christmas the children hold services in
the church to which their parents and  
villages attend.
