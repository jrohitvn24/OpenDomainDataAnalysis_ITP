		<title>20Social Concerns</title>
		<content>One of the most important areas of     
social concern in Hednesford is the    
rising unemployment levels.  Local     
unemployment has now reached 25% and is
well above the national average. In    
many families mothers are going out to 
work and fathers are out of work. This 
is affecting family life. Another major
concern is the threat of nuclear war. A
group called CND are trying to prevent 
more nuclear missiles being developed  
by holding demonstrations. Cruelty to  
children and animals continues to cause
concern despite the efforts of groups  
like NSPCC, RSPCA and Greenpeace. At   
the present time, people are concerned 
about poverty and famine in countries  
like Africa, where thousands of people 
are starving and dying daily from mal  
nuitrition. Many people feel money     
spent on nuclear weapons would be      
better spent helping poorer countries. </content>
