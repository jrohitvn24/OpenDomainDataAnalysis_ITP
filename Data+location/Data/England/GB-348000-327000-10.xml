		<title>10Ghosts!</title>
		<content>   In wem there are four very well     
 known ghosts. One of them committed   
 suicide in the Castle Mound           
 House. His wife died of cancer and he 
 was so afraid of catching it himself  
 that he shot himself in the head in   
 his barn.                             
   Down the Ellesmere Road, there is a 
 ghost of a milkmaid who walks across  
 the road with no legs.                
   In the Hawkstone Lake, there is the 
 ghost of a baby who had been with her 
 dog. The baby fell in the lake and    
 drowned. Soon after that a vicar came 
 to bless the lake because the baby    
 was haunting it and since then no one 
 has seen the ghost                    
   Most recently, a boy called Ben     
 Phillimore saw the ghost of an old    
 lady who stopped him going into his   
 parents' room when he had woken up    
 during the night.                     </content>
