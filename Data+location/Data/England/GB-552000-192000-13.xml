		<title>13COUNTRY DANCING</title>
		<content>    On Thursday June 6th ten schools   
 took part in the{Country Dance        
{Festival}held at{Brookside Junior     
{School.}Due to the wet weather we had 
 to dance in the two school halls. It  
 was very cramped in the Infants Hall  
 as there were dancing teams from four 
 schools:-{Broadford, Pyrgo-Priory,    
{Dycourts, and Brookside}as well as    
 many parents.                         
    After we had demonstrated each     
 dance we also encouraged our parets to
 join in which proved great fun.       
 Despite not having much room we all   
 enjoyed ourselves.                    
    A slide showing the dancing can be 
 seen by referring to{photograph C}in  
 the photograph section of this        
 program. Another slide was also buried
 in the{Time Capsule.}See page 14 of
