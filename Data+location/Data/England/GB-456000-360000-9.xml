		<content>      There are eight teachers at      
 Forest Town Junior School. Mr. Dennis 
 is the headmaster.                    
      There are seven classes in the   
 main school. When we go for assemblies
 we go in the main school. For our     
 dinner we go in the canteen.          
      We have assembly on a Monday and 
 Tuesday. We also have a house assembly
 on a Friday. We have games on a Friday
 and P.E. on a Monday. We do Maths     
 every day. We do English and we have a
 project. Inside the school there is a 
 library.                              
      Mr. Young comes and teaches us   
 about first aid but particularly about
 lungs. We did experiments on how our  
 lungs get blocked up. We're doing a   
 Doomsday book. We're writing about    
 Forest Town and its suooroundings.
