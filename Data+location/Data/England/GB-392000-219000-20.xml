		<title>20GREATFIELD PARK,CHELTENHAM</title>
		<content> I live in Greatfield Park,a new estate
 in Hatherley,Cheltenham.My road is    
 called Timperley Way.There are many   
 other roads and cul_de_sacs being     
 built such as Pyrton Mews &amp; Calverley 
 Mews which are both cul_de_sacs and   
 Runnymede which is an ordinary road.  
 When the building of Greatfield Park  
 began there was only one access but as
 the building moved on another access  
 was made and this time a big road was 
 joined on.Then the first road was cut 
 off and the only way out of the estate
 was to go down the long road and out  
 on to Greatfield Lane.The estate was  
 started in 1983 and before this the   
 houses opposite had a good view across
 open fields so the building was not   
 very popular with some people.Even so,
 there is still quite a beautiful view 
 of Leckhampton Hill from anywhere in  
 Greatfield Park.I like our new house! </content>
