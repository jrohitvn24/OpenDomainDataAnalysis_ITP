		<title>14Brereton Heath Park.</title>
		<content>  Brereton Heath Park is one of the    
{principal leisure areas}in our        
 vicinity,for the pleasure of hundreds 
 and to the consternation of some of   
 the local population.Eighty acres  of 
 woodland,water and heath make-up this 
 site,which owes its presence to the   
{Ice-Age}when melting water from       
 retreating ice sheets left large      
 quantities of sand in the area. Sand  
 which was quarried until 1973 when it 
 had been worked out.The land was      
 bought in 1981 and a year later the   
 park was created.                     
 During the summer months hundreds of  
 people use the park for a{variety of  
{pursuits}Fishing,canoeing,wind-surfing
 are sports allowed on the lake but    
 many go swimming which is not         
 advisable due to underwater weeds and 
 the depth of water at the centre of   
 the lake.                             </content>
