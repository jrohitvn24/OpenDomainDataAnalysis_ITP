		<title>20TRIP TO SB House.</title>
		<content> rea where there was equipment for show
 umping and horse training.Beyond the  
dry stone wall was the pasture leading 
down to what was an ornamental pond in 
a landscaped area.As we were going back
to school we decided that the cameraman
should sit at the back of the minibus  
with the doors open to take final shots
of the drive and gates.Mr Snowball a   
retired colonel is going to send usmore
information about the House.Mr Liffney 
who is the area retail manager for     
Zannussi showed us an old book from    
his library which told about one of    
the past owners who had become Lord    
Mayor of Newcastle and had been        
knighted for his work. We will follow  
that up as part of our 365             
Communications course and our TVEI     
Media Studies. The video film will be  
lent to our local First and Middle     
schools to help them with local work   </content>
