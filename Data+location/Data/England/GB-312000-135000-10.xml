		<title>10Gamekeeping_Rearing Birds</title>
		<content>      When the eggs hatch the chicks   
 are put under the{electric hen.}Two   
 weeks later they are put out into a   
 high wire pen with a{netting roof.}   
 When they have their adult feathers at
 about 4 weeks they are in a pen       
{without a top.}                       
                                       
     Foxes,weasels,stoats and hawks are
{enemies}of the young chick. The       
 Gamekeeper rears 3.000 chicks ready   
 for the{October Shoot.}He also rears a
 few ducks and partridges. By October  
 the young birds must be well grown or 
 they will not survive in the wild.    
                                       
      At the{Shoot}he organizes the{   
{beaters}and takes his 2{spaniels}to{  
{flush out}and{drive}the birds while   
 the {labrador retrieves}the shot      
 birds. Only half of the reared birds  
 are shot during the season.           </content>
