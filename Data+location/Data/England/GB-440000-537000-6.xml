		<title>06HOUSING-THE RURAL VILLAGES</title>
		<content> The surrounding villages have kept    
 their seperate identities.Durham      
 County Council decided to make        
 Heselden a D category village as the  
 houses were old and had few           
 facilities.The villages fought the    
 idea,the Council relented and kept the
 village alive.The Wellfield area of   
 mining,Wingate,is a mixture of private
 and council housing built from the    
 1930's to 1985.Old Shotton is an old  
 agricultural settlement with 18th     
 century houses an Hall.Although the   
 new town of Peterlee has enveloped    
 it,it still retains its own identity. 
 Castle Eden another rural village,is a
 scattered community of 18th and 19th  
 century houses of historical interest,
 many large homes in private grounds   
 and some council properties.It is     
 regarded by local people as a         
 desirable place to live.              </content>
