		<title>17Disasters in Plympton St.M.</title>
		<content>  There was a{fire}at Battisford farm  
 which lasted for 24hrs although no    
 animals were lost.                    
  More serious and far reaching are the
{land losses}from farms due to the A.38
 expansion.Ford farm was badly hit and 
 had to sell acres on the north side of
 the road to another farm.Until this   
 was done the farmer had to herd his   
 cattle across the A.38{holding a red  
{flag}to warn oncoming drivers.        
  Farmers generally felt that          
 compensation for loss of land was     
 ridiculously low.They also fear{break-
{ups}in marriages,for the result is    
 that one half of a farm may be sold   
 off and bought by the local authority 
 for industrial expansion.             
{ Concrete cancer}has been found in one
 of the bridges over the A.38 and is   
 being remedied.
