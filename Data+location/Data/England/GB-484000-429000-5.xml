		<content>  Our village school is over a hundred 
 years old.During the last four years  
 it has been modernised.The school     
 house adjoining the school,which was  
 built for the head teacher, has been  
 converted to become part of the       
 school.Further building of newly      
 designed classrooms,intended for two  
 teachers to team teach their classes, 
 in L-shaped rooms,will replace the    
 existing five classrooms.The new      
 building also includes a new hall and 
 kitchen.It is hoped that the Building 
 work will begin in 1986.At the moment 
 the school is on a split site.The two 
 top classes of our junior school are  
 housed in an annex building, adjacent 
 to the school.This building was       
 erected at the beginning of the second
 world war.It was a nursery unit built 
 to care for children whose mothers    
 were working on the land.             </content>
