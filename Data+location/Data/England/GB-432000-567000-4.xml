		<content> The Metro has got automatic doors and 
 they are sometimes dangerous. You     
 could get stuck in them. Thers is a   
 warning tone to warn you when the door
 will close.There is a green light to  
 tell you when you can press the button
 to open the doors.Inside there are    
 rows of seats to sit down if you are  
 going a long way.                     
  When i get to the Metro station i    
 press B4 and it tells you what to pay.
 If it says 30p and you put 50p in, it 
 gives you your 20p change and if you  
 put 20p in, it tells you,you need to  
 pay 10p more.Then you go to a machine 
 into which you put your ticket and it 
 cancels your ticket so that you can't 
 use it again with out  paying again.  
 If an inspector checks your ticket it 
 shows that it is  valid.
