		<title>17ST BERNARD'S CATHOLIC CHURCH</title>
		<content>   Fr Thomas Hannon has lived for one  
 year in Knott End where he has been   
 parish priest of St Bernard's Church  
 which was built in 1922. In an        
 interview he said that most church    
 goers are over 50 but that a lot of   
 children also come to church. About   
 220 people come to church each week   
 and more come than did two years ago. 
 The oldest parishioner is 94 and many 
 young people want to be ministers but 
 not any girls. He said that he didn't 
 know whether more people were joining 
 the church, but once a month he meets 
 with clergy of other faiths and       
 churches and he has a strong wish for 
 church unity. He said that most people
 there had lived hard lives and were   
 enjoying retirement in a good         
 community. He said that he would like 
 to get the people who had stopped     
 coming to church to come back again.  </content>
