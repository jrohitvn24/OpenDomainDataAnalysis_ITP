		<content> All families are well housed although 
 some enjoy a higher standard of living
 than others. The shift towards smaller
 families means that most children have
 a bedroom of their own;this is much   
 more than a room in which to sleep. It
 is used to entertain friends ,to watch
 T.V.and a place in which to do        
 homework. Meals consist of            
 breakfast,lunch and dinner;lunch is   
 usually taken at school during        
 term-time. Many families have two     
 wage-earners,but a high car ownership 
 means that families can still do      
 things together,especially at         
 weekends. The population shift means  
 that there are fewer extended families
 than before the war,and there are more
 nuclear families. There are families  
 formed by remarriage,and there are    
 many one-parent families
