		<title>06THE DOCTORS SURGERY, HOPTON</title>
		<content> In Hopton there are two doctors.  One 
 doctor is on duty 24 hours a day and  
 the surgery is open between 9am. and  
 11am. Mondays to Fridays and 5pm. to  
 7pm. on Mondays, Wednesdays and       
 Fridays.  The family practice covers  
 an area of approximately a ten mile   
 radius and home calls are made when   
 necessary. If the patient needs any   
 medicine, then the surgery will       
 dispense it provided the patient does 
 not live within a mile of a chemist.  
 There is a district nurse who looks   
 after those who need regular help. A  
 prescription costs Â£2.OO and          
 appointments are free to those on the 
 National Health scheme. Private       
 patients are welcome too.  The Hopton 
 practice is new, very hygenic and     
 helpful.  Some records are on comput- 
 ter; most are hand written.  In August
 1985 a dentist's surgery opens there. </content>
