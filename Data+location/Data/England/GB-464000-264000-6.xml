		<content>   Although only a portion of Kilndown 
Village is included in the allocated   
rectangle, this portion contains the   
social centre of the village. Christ   
Church, the Village School and the     
Quarry Centre are mentioned in         
other pages.                           
   The Globe &amp; Rainbow is the only     
public house in the village. Its two   
bars were recently made into one, but  
effectively still operate as two. It   
has a large functions room, with a     
T.V. projector and large screen, used  
for many village meetings. A new       
toilet block is now nearly completed.  
There is a small restaurant, and the   
hotel side has several rooms,          
frequently used by touring cricket     
teams. The village children get sweets 
and soft drinks from the Globe.        
   The once a day bus service turns    
round outside the Globe &amp; Rainbow.     </content>
