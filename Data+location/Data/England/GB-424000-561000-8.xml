		<title>08THE RIVER TYNE POLICE</title>
		<content>   Police have patrolled the {River    
{Tyne}for more than{100 years.}The     
 first patrols used{rowing boats}and   
 were armed with{cutlasses.}Today, the 
 patrols which are based at            
 Pipewellgate use fast boats and VHF   
 radios. These policemen are           
 responsible for patrolling the River  
 Tyne and the coastal waters from{     
{Berwick to Ryhope.}Constables Fryer   
 and Cummings told us that they were   
 just like other policemen "except we  
 use boats not panda cars". One of     
 their new duties is a side effect of  
 the{cleaning up}of the Tyne;the       
 fresher water means more fresh water  
 fish and they have to try and stop{   
{salmon poaching.}In fact there is so  
 much fish in the river that a{seal}has
 taken up residence at Newburn.
