		<title>06THE VILLAGE SCHOOL</title>
		<content>{Tudor grammar schools}were founded in 
 both{Alton and Farnham}and the church 
 was the source of any primary teaching
 in the village. Bentley had its own   
{Dame School(s)}giving rudimentary     
 education to farmworkers children. The
 records of Vestry Meetings show that  
 in{1797 a "school of industry"}was    
 supported where girls were taught to  
 knit gloves.                          
                                       
{In 1842 the Bishop of Winchester }    
{granted one half acre "for a school}  
{for poor persons".}When enlarged in   
 1913 to its present size on the same  
 site it was necessary to move the     
 children from the site while work took
 place. During this period the{children
 were{taught in a new hop kiln}kindly  
 loaned by a local farmer. A proposal  
 to modernise the school will mean a   
 similar evacuation.{Where to in 1986?}</content>
