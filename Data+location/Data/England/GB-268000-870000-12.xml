		<content> the old stone has been hidden under   
 harling. Such modernisation has not,  
 unfortunately, been in keeping with   
 the environment.                      
 In contrast the new houses have       
 been built of concrete blocks then    
 rendered and harled with roofs of man 
 made tiles;their windows are large    
 (picture) and doubled-glazed; chimneys
 are an exception.                     
 The above reflects the changes that   
 have taken place both n this block and
 adjacent ones. Changes in farming have
 seen not only grearer properity but   
 also both the amalgamation of farms   
 and the reduction in the workforce so 
 farmhouses and cottages have been     
 sold. The rapid increase in the       
 population and the greater prosperity 
 due to industrial development  meant  
 that many people could afford to own  
 their own homes and chose to do so rat</content>
