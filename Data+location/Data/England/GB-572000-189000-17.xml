		<title>17BASILDON NE: DRUG CENTRE I</title>
		<content> The old Rectory Of St. Peter's Church 
 at Nevendon was acquired by volunteers
 in 1982 and is now the{'Still Waters' 
{Drug Rehabilitation Centre.           
 It is self-supporting, and makes no   
 charge on the boarders but receives   
 any social security benefits if the   
 boarder is entitled to any. There are 
 beds to accomodate 8 people who are   
 sent from a variety of sources and far
 more are referred than can be         
 accomodated. The selection is based on
 need. These people come from all over 
 the country and are mostly heroin     
 addicts. They stay between 9 and 13   
 months and the aim is not only to     
 break the addiction but to help them  
 regain their self-respect and         
 rehabilitate them by providing them   
 with accomodation and a job (obviously
 very difficult) wherever possible.
