		<content> The village has just one shop built in
 1960. Previous shops were usually     
 found in local cottages. The present  
 shop combines Post Office, butcher and
 grocer. It is a family concern. The   
 Post Office section deals with stamp  
 sales, pensions, savings bank, TV and 
 radio licences. Meat packs for the    
 deep freeze form part of the butchery 
 business. Fresh meat is chosen and    
 bought by the butcher at local        
 auctions. Sausage, pies and pasties   
 are made on the premises. All kinds of
 grocery goods are sold as well as some
 fruit and vegetables. Travelling      
 shops, such as the baker &amp; fishmonger 
 visit the village weekly. There is one
 public house the Wellington Inn and   
 reputed to have its own ghost. Some   
 years ago a pathway subsided and an   
 old well was discovered, possibly
