 ditches have been lined with wooden   
 boards to stop the banks crumbling.   
 The water is let off the land by      
 plastic pipes which enter the ditches 
 via wooden shutes again to stop the   
 removal of soil from the ditch side.  
 CROPS. The cash crops grown are Leeks,
 Potatoes, Cabbages and Barley. The    
 other crops are fodder crops to feed  
 the animals. The pasture can be found 
 close to the farm buildings so the    
 cows don't have far to walk at milking
 time.Longer distances waste time and  
 reduce milk yield. A lot of time is   
 spent where leeks and cabbages are    
 grown because they're labour intensive
 and need harvesting by hand. The other
 crops are capital intensive and take  
 up less time because machinery is used
 throughout the time from planting to  
 harvesting.                           </content>
