		<content> In parts of our area it is very       
 difficult to travel unless you own a  
 car. If you live in Worleston,Poole or
 Aston Juxta Mondrum then you can only 
 catch a bus on Tuesdays or Thursdays, 
 and then there are only two on each of
 those days.On Thursdays the buses are 
 very busy because it is market day in 
 Nantwich and all the old age          
 pensioners come into town to get their
 money and to do their shopping.       
 In the south east of the area the     
 buses run every hour, but this service
 is mostly used by people going from   
 Crewe to Nantwich and it only operates
 in three out of our twelve blocks.    
 A lot of people have problems because 
 there aren't enough buses. People find
 it very difficult to get to work if   
 they don't have a car. Children can   
 not get to the swimming baths or to   
 the sports centres.                   </content>
