		<title>05Yarley Cross Farm</title>
		<content>  Cross Farm was built in 1600 and has 
 been used as a farm until purchased by
 the present owner who runs it as a Bed
 and Breakfast establishment.They keep 
 chickens,geese and ducks and use the  
 eggs themselves or sell them          
 privately.                            
  The farm is a longhouse built so     
 that the people could live in one     
 half of the house and the animals in  
 the other. Inside the farm there is   
 a large fireplace which was built in  
 1682 and which has the initials       
 C.T.E. on it. This is the man who     
 made it,Clifford Theodore Eakes.      
  Outside in the courtyard there is    
 an old barn which was once used for   
 storing cider and where you can       
 still see the old barrels.            
  At one time the house was used as a  
 school and there are two peepholes in 
 a  wall for teachers to spy on pupils.</content>
