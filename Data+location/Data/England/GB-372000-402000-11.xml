		<title>11INDUSTRY IN WALKDEN contd</title>
		<content> INDUSTRY IN WALKDEN CONTINUED         
 Industry in Walkden has never been    
 successful.The old factory relics can 
 still be found around the area.Many   
 abandoned warehouses are now being    
 pulled down to make room for new      
 factory units.The little industry that
 there is lies on the outskirts of the 
 town on industrial estates near the   
 main roads.Here,medical aids,recycled 
 metals and do_it_yourself are the main
 industries.Many of the old factory    
 buildings have been converted into    
 smaller separate work units producing 
 a variety of goods.Some of these units
 could hardly be classed as industry   
 due to their low output.              
 The majority of Walkden's population  
 work outside the town in places like  
 Manchester and Bolton.
