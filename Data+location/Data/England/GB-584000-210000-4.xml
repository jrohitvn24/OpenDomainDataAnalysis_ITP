		<title>04The Barn Evangelical Church</title>
		<content>      The Barn Evangelical Chapel      
 started life as a barn belonging to a 
 farmer called Foster. Foster Road     
 was named because it was built on     
 Mr. Foster's land and Harvey Road is  
 named after his son. A ploughman John 
 Raven first used it as a Chapel in    
 1822. It is built of lath, wood and   
 plaster and the roof is thatched.     
 Large beams in the barn are thought to
 originate from Maldon Barges.         
      Inside, the chapel is plainly    
 furnished with chairs, not pews. There
 is no choir. There are no stained     
 windows.                              
      They now hold services four      
 times a week but have no permanent    
 minister. The youngest attender is six
 months old. This church practices     
 adult baptism.
