		<title>10THE MULLARD FACTORY B'BURN.</title>
		<content>The Mullard factory site covers an area
of 50 acres, since the factory was     
opened in 1938 over a dozen buildings  
have been added. At present some of    
these buildings are no longer in use   
and the workforce has been reduced from
a peak of 6000 to 1250. Today , along  
with some electronic components Mullard
a part of the Philips company, is the  
sole U.K. producer of the Laser-Vision 
Disc on which the Domesday Data will be
presented. About 200 people are        
involved in the production of the disc 
and 30,000 are produced each week. The 
production of the disc began in 1980   
and the process now operates 24 hours  
a day, 7 days a week. The Laser-Vision 
disc is a sophisticated video          
information storage system which can   
give easy access to large amounts of   
stored data, both pictures and text.
