		<content>The grasshopper is the badge of        
Tatsfield School.Sir Thomas Gresham,who
built the Royal Exchange in London in  
1570,was the son of a poor woman who,  
when he was a baby,abandoned him in a  
field.However the chirping of a        
grasshopper attracted a boy to where he
lay,thus saving his life.When he became
a rich merchant he chose a grasshopper 
for his  crest.There is now a large    
gilt grasshopper on top of the Royal   
Exchange building.The Gunpowder Plot of
Nov.5th. 1605 was foiled when one of   
his conspirators warned his M.P.friend.
It is said that between 5p.m. and 6p.m.
on Nov.5th the horse of this           
conspirator can be heard passing Church
Corner, Tatsfield on its flight from   
London.
