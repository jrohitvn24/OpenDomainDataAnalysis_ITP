		<content>   The main threat to the environment  
 here is urbanisation- i.e. the rapid  
 growth of Sleights.  However, the area
 contains mostly the older part of     
 Sleights and there is less threat     
 from development. The area above      
 Sleights is in the North Yorkshire    
 Moors National Park, and little       
 conservation work is needed.  The only
 woodland is on steep and unstable land
 and there is little threat from       
 agriculture.  Almost all the moorland 
 on the north side of the valley was   
 re-claimed for forestry many years    
 ago.                                  
   The River Esk is Yorkshire's only   
 Salmon river and fishing rights are   
 guarded fiercely by the holders.  The 
 river is protected to a large extent  
 from pollution and overfishing by the 
 National Park authorities and the     
 Yorkshire Water Authority.            </content>
