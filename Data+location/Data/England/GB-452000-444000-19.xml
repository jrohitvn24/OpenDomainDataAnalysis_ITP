		<content> In 1953 books and paper were in short 
 supply.The teacher made the ink from  
 powder,and children used dip pens.In  
 1985 cartridge pens are the most      
 popular tool,but various disposable   
 pens are common.Felt pens have not    
 fully replaced wax and pencil crayons,
 both of which were used frugally in   
 1953.Paper,paint,adhesives and pencils
 have improved in variety and quality  
 over the years.The old utility pencil 
 _allowance 2 per year_ carried road   
 safety rules.In 1985 pencils still    
 have road safety rules, or sometimes  
 anti_smoking slogans.32 years ago the 
 school had a piano,an old radio, and  
 an antique gramophone.The headteacher 
 had her own film strip projector and a
 typewriter.There was no telephone.Now 
 there are modern aids _ an overhead   
 projector,duplicator,record players,a 
 heatcopier,a computer and a telephone.</content>
