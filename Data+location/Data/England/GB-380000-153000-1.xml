		<title>01SUMMARY- RODE AND SOUTHWICK.</title>
		<content> This area, straddling the Wiltshire/  
 Somerset border is agricultural. It is
 a very pleasant place to live. The    
 land rises gently from the river Frome
 towards the villages of Rode and      
 Southwick but rises steeply towards   
 Tellisford. These three villages are  
 the main centres of population. They  
 are quite different in character.     
 Southwick is largest, with many modern
 homes and young families. Rode is a   
 very old village, with some new       
 houses. It is a lively place with many
 activites for all age groups.         
 Tellisford is a small, very old       
 village, with few public facilities.  
 Most people are employed in the       
 surrounding towns of Trowbridge Frome,
 Bath, Westbury and Warminster.        
 We have attempted in these pages to   
 describe the area and the life of the 
 people of the villages.               </content>
