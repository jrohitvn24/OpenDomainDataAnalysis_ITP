		<title>10TELFORD JOB TRAINING</title>
		<content>  In Telford there are nine major      
 building firms. One of the major      
 industries in the town, encouraged by 
 the Telford Development Corporation,  
 is the building of new houses and the 
 refurbishment of old properties. Yet  
 with the recession firms are often    
 reluctant to train young workers. In  
 response to this, the Telford Youth   
 Training Agency, has recently been    
 given new life. It is located in      
 converted premises, by Lawley         
 roundabout. 60 youths, aged 16, are   
 being taken on, financed by the Man-  
 Power Services Commission, and given  
 training in the skills of a           
 'construction worker'. For two weekly 
 stints they train in the Lawley       
 workshop, and then spend the same time
 working on a real job, using those    
 skills, for example, refurbishing an  
 old building, selected by the TDC.    </content>
