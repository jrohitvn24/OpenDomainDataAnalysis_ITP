		<title>17Law and Order - Dog Training</title>
		<content>Location: Home Farm House (listed      
building) Harborne.                    
                                       
Tucked away in an old converted farm   
building is the West Midlands Police   
Dog Training Centre. This is of        
considerable importance since it is    
responsible for the training of all    
police dogs in the West Midlands area  
which extends as far as Staffordshire  
Warwickshire &amp; West Mercia. The Centre 
not only trains between 15 &amp; 20 young  
dogs each year but also provides       
regular refresher courses for all dogs 
that are already working in the force. 
The dogs (Alsations) are mainly        
trained for general day to day police  
work but a steadily increasing number  
are trained for more specialist work   
ie. drug detection, arms &amp; explosive   
work &amp; location of buried bodies.
