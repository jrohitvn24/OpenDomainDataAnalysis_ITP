		<content> Each year in Mid-December a ceremony  
 is held in front of St. John's Church,
 Glastonbury.                          
 A short service is held as townsfolk, 
 visitors, and children from St. John's
 Infant School gather with the Mayoral 
 party round the{Holy Thorn tree.}It is
 a descendant of the Holy Thorn which  
 legend tells sprang up when{Joseph of 
{Arimathea}planted his staff on        
 Wearyall Hill.                        
 Legend tells how the Thorn has since  
 bloomed twice annually, at Christmas, 
 to commemorate the birth of Christ,   
 and again in the Spring.              
 Sprigs of the Holy Thorn are cut by   
 the Vicar, Mayor and a child from the 
 school. These sprigs are then sent    
 with the good wishes of all the towns-
 folk to{Her Majesty the Queen,}and the
{Queen Mother.}The sprigs adorn their  
 breakfast trays on Christmas Day.     </content>
