		<content>     Many different{birds}can be seen  
 at the reserve, some{migratory birds  
 spend the winter there and some only  
 stop to feed and rest. There are many 
{insects}there so the birds find food  
 easily. You can find{slugs}and{snails 
 everywhere. In the lakes you can see  
{fish}and{eels.                        
     There are{trees}on the reserve,   
 mainly{alder}but also there are       
{willow, ash}and{oak. Wild flowers     
 cover lots of the land and they       
 attract different kinds of            
{butterflies.                          
     In the winter 84/85 wardens       
 reported that there were{three        
{bitterns. }The bad weather caused the 
 lakes to freeze for about a month. The
 River Stour was still running but the 
{bitterns}were too shy to go and feed  
 there; one died of starvation.
