		<content> Although the area is a rural one there
 are three pockets of small industrial 
 units, one being a former cotton mill,
 one a disused brickworks, the other a 
 disused quarry. The mill has small    
 engineering units, a Christmas cracker
 maker and other small enterprises. The
 quarry has a paving flag maker and the
 brickworks welding &amp; small engineering
 There is a working quarry selling     
 stone. There are also heavy haulage   
 firms, which are causing some concern 
 with large lorries using narrow lanes.
  Unemployment is low in comparison to 
 other areas of the U.K., the majority 
 being employed in nearby Bollington   
 and Macclesfield and some commuting to
 the Manchester area. The sheep and    
 dairy farms are family units and      
 employ little extra labour. Public    
 houses and a cafe pravide a small     
 amount of part time employment.       </content>
