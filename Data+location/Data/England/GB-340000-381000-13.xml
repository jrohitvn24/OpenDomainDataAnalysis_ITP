		<title>13REVEREND AMOS- AN INTERVIEW</title>
		<content> We interviewed our vicar,   a kind and
 understanding person.    He is the 8th
 vicar at All Saints,  having been here
 for 7 years. He likes being a vicar in
 the Speke Parish, and when asked about
 his  job  he  said....  "I try to help
 worshippers  at  All Saints to be good
 christians". Before coming here he had
 been at St.Christophers-Cheltenham,St.
 Andrews-Peckham,  All Saints-Walworth,
 and Holy Trinity.                     
       He is married and has a baby son
 called David.    His favourite hymn is
 "The Living Lord". He enjoys listening
 to  Cliff Richard,   Julie Andrews and
 Welsh music.                          
   If he had the chance to do something
 else he would like to work on radio or
 television.
