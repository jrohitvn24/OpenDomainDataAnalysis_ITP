		<title>08Farming in Horsted Keynes</title>
		<content>   There are lots of farms in Horsted  
 Keynes; some raise cattle, some are   
 chicken farms, some grow crops such   
 as wheat, corn, and barley and some   
 just grow grass for the animals.      
   Tremains Farm has been rented by Mr 
 Butler from Mrs Hatley.They used to   
 have 10 milking machines but now they 
 have added 6 more.The cows are milked 
 between 5.00 and 9.00 in the morning  
 and at 6.30 in the evening. The milk  
 goes to a number of different dairies.
 There are 170 cows on the farm.       
   Belverdere Farm is a meat farm. It  
 has 4 heifers, 4 pigs, 40 chickens and
 2 rabbits. They raise the pigs for    
 pork and bacon, the cows for beef and 
 the chickens for eggs. They do not    
 grow food crops on the farm.          
   A lot of the farmland around the    
 village is owned by the family of the 
 Earl of Stockton who live nearby.     </content>
