		<title>19PREVIOUS DOMESDAY REFERENCE.</title>
		<content>During 1066 when the original domesday 
book was drawn up there was no entry   
for Wheaton Aston in its own           
name.There is however reference made   
to Lapley and it reads as follows:     
  Â£The Church at St.Renny at Lapley    
(3 hides) was held by T.R.E.by the     
church from the King and still is.     
There are 3 ploughs and 5 serfs in     
demense.The 18 villeins and 9 borders  
have 8 ploughs.There are 16 acres of   
meadow and woodland 3 furlongs long    
and 3 furlongs wide.It is valued at    
50s.                                   
    Although Wheaton Aston is not      
mentioned the reference to 18 villeins 
and 9 small holdings suggests a larger 
settlement than Lapley would be on it's
own.                                   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
