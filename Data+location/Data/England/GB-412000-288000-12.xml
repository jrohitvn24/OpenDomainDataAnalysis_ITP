		<title>12...ENTERTAINMENT</title>
		<content>Entertainment in the form of live      
theatre, opera or cinema is not a      
feature of the area because of the lack
of facilities. The ever increasing use 
of home videos has superceded the need 
for films on the large screen. Many    
people enjoy bingo sessions which are  
readily available at some of the       
community centres and clubs. There are 
many public houses offering entertain- 
ment in the form of live groups to     
cater for a variety of tastes. Discos  
are also popular and even the youngest 
can enjoy some that are held. Senior   
citizens are able to attend special    
dance sessions and there are drop-in   
clubs at some of the centres. The      
comparative inadequacy of some         
facilities in the area should be       
alleviated somewhat when the Firs and  
Bromford Sports and Community Centre   
is opened on the 29th June 1985.       </content>
