		<content> My name is Graham Raven and I have    
 lived in Overy Staithe all my life -  
 some thirty years.  As a boy I played 
 in the Creek and marshes getting to   
 know every stream, every mudbank and  
 every feature of the area.  I became  
 interested in shooting and fishing and
 never missed the opportunity to go to 
 sea in a boat.  While I grew so did   
 the danger of the sea and it became   
 obvious that sooner or later winter   
 high tides would break the banks and  
 flood the area with disastrous        
 results.  Fortunately the Manpower    
 Services Commission was asked to help 
 out and I became involved with a      
 strong team of local men who were paid
 to bolster the defence against the    
 sea.  The work has lasted for two     
 years and we have achieved a great    
 deal.  We hope the defences are secure
 for many years.                       </content>
