The history of the area goes back to   
Roman times and there was a Roman Villa
at GR 534134 from which pottery shards 
collected and recorded by the school   
were dated by the Woodstock Museum     
between the 2nd and 4th centuries      
BC.Scattered flints of Neolithic origin
and a Saxon spearhead were also found  
on this site.In the NE corner of Islip 
there is the still recognisable site of
a mediaeval manor house (the moat and  
fishponds are discernable).Edward the  
Confessor was born in Islip and gave   
"ye little Towne" to Westminster in    
whose gift it still remains.There was a
battle for the bridge in the Civil War 
at which Cromwell himself was          
present.There were riots on Otmoor over
the enclosures in the 19th century.The 
cry "Otmoor for ever" still rings      
through the area.                      </content>
