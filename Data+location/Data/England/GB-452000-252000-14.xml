		<content> The village community centre uses the 
old C.of E.school buildings.The        
building was aquired from the Dryden   
Family(of poet fame)to whom the village
pays a Â£peppercorn'rent and it was     
officially opened in 1977.             
                          A number of  
organizations use it on a permanent    
basis.The doctors have a regular       
surgery there.The County have opened a 
permanent library which opens twice a  
week on Mondays and Fridays.There is a 
Â£day room' for the over 60's and Mrs.  
Brooks runs her playgroup there.There  
is a large hall which can be used for  
wedding receiptions,private parties,   
dances etc. and an adjoining kitchen   
has facilities for cooking and food    
preparation.                           
            There is a sliding scale of
charges for the hire of this hall.
