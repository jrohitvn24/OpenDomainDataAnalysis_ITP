		<content> Many people have large gardens and    
 produce their own vegetables. Fresh   
 crops are preserved in freezers and   
 little convenience food is eaten. Most
 families tend to enjoy simple menus.  
 We discovered an unusual dish called  
 Gloucester Pie consisting of sausages,
 apples, hard boiled eggs and cider.   
 Some people keep chickens and rabbits 
 for the table and some wild rabbits,  
 hares and pigeons are also caught and 
 used in traditional recipes.          
 Watching television is a popular      
 pastime among the older and younger   
 people, whilst others enjoy whist     
 drives and bingo sessions. We found   
 that most people had lots of hobbies, 
 including playing bridge, making corn 
 dollies, writing, wind surfing and    
 hunting with the Ledbury Hunt, which  
 has its kennels just outside the      
 village of Bromesberrow.              </content>
