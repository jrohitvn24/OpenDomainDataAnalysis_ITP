  All the districts of Hyndburn are    
connected by footpaths. From Church    
Kirk a path goes to Plowtalgh Farm and 
on the edge of Dunkenhalgh Park to the 
A678 road. The path continues across   
the road to Mercer Park. The River     
Hyndburn is in sight most of the way. A
little way up the hill on the A678     
towards Rishton a path goes through the
hamlet of Tottleworth to Gt. Harwood.  
Between the Leeds-Liverpool Canal at   
Rishton, Parsonage and Dean Clough     
Reservoirs there is a large network of 
paths. Some of these are included in a 
walk called 'Hyndburn Clog', recently  
devised by John Allen of the N.E. Lancs
Ramblers Association. Anyone completing
the 31 mile walk in 14 hours is awarded
a certificate.
