		<title>11A DAY ON THE FARM</title>
		<content> My name is Rhiannon,I am nine years   
 old and I live in Warton.I work at Ivy
 House Farm after school,at weekends   
 and in my holidays.I wake up at 6.30am
 and{farming}clothes.I make myself some
 breakfast which is usually a cup of   
 coffee and a sandwich.I put on my     
 wellies and go to the fields with the{
{farmer}to fetch the cows for milking. 
 We bring them to the collecting yard. 
 When milking is finished we measure   
 some milk out for the calves, then I  
 go home for the rest of my breakfast. 
 I go back to the farm again in the    
 afternoon and I leave the cows in the 
 milking parlour and I go to feed the  
 heifers.At other times during the year
 I help with the{harvest}and in the    
 winter when the cattle are in the barn
 we feed them silage.I enjoy working on
 the farm because I love the{country}  
 and animals.                          </content>
