		<title>02OLD R'WAY LINE, DRAYTON</title>
		<content>      Part of the{Midland and Great    
{Northern  Railway,}Drayton station    
 was opened in{1882.}The station       
 employed 6 or 7 local people.There was
 a waiting room,ticket office and      
 manager's office,as well as some goods
 sheds and a signal box.Along with     
 general freight, the trains carried   
 locally-made bricks,and paper from    
 the mill at Taverham.                 
      The station closed in{1952,}and  
 in 1965 rebuilding took place,        
 converting the area into a small      
{industrial park.}Some of the original 
 buildings are still standing.         
      The railway is now an attractive 
{foot and bridle path,}part of which is
 a nature trail.Now called Marriott's  
 way, the path offers a pleasant walk  
 through the Norfolk countryside.Locals
 enjoy this amenity,but would like a   
 quick,easy route to Norwich.          </content>
