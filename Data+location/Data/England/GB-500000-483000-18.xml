		<title>18Sewage Works</title>
		<content> The Seamer Sewage Works,built in 1947,
 serves 17 villages around Scarborough.
 The sewage is pumped to the works.In  
 1970 the works were extended to take  
 1,000,000 gallons of sewage a day.It  
 is taken to the top of the inlet by an
 Archemedes screw pump.It goes through 
 a grit trap where grit settles and is 
 taken away,through a shredder then to 
 the primary settlement tanks.The      
 sewage flows into a tank where solids 
 sink to an embanked bottom,where      
 the liquid is pumped into tanks filled
 with rocks with bacteria on.The sewage
 is pumped onto them,the effluence is  
 eaten and the water containing NO3    
 flows to humus tanks which filters    
 more impurities.It goes through a     
 clarifier (mesh and gravel) where the 
 last impurities are filtered.Finally  
 water comes out and is pumped into    
 streams.The works serve 40,000 people.</content>
