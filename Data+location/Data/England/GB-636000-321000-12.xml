		<title>12SUTTON FIRST SCHOOL</title>
		<content> There are records of a village school 
 in Sutton since 1873, but the present 
 school is housed in a modern building 
 built 10 years ago. It takes in       
 children at the age of 4 or 5 and they
 leave when they are 8. In July 1985   
 the number of pupils was 65, but this 
 number varies considerably from year  
 to year as families move in and out of
 the village. The teaching staff       
 consists of a Head Teacher and 3 other
 teachers. In addition to Sutton       
 children, the school also takes       
 children from the village of Ingham.  
 The school is an integral part of     
 village life and, in addition to      
 parents, many other villagers attend  
 concerts and entertainments given by  
 the children during the year. The     
 school has a kitchen to provide a     
 mid-day meal for the children who want
 one.                                  </content>
