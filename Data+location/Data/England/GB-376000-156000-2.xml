		<content> HINTON CHARTERHOUSE'S{CRICKET CLUB}IS 
 ABOUT 90 YEARS OLD.IT PROVIDES THE    
 MAIN FORM OF RECREATION FOR THE MEN IN
 THE VILLAGE,WHILE THE WIVES MAKE THE  
 TEAS AND USE THE PAVILION FOR THEIR   
 OWN PURPOSES. MANY ACTIVITIES ARE     
 CENTRED AROUND THE CLUB,e.g.FETES AND 
 JUMBLE SALES.                         
  HINTON CHARTERHOUSE'S POPULATION IS  
 ALMOST COMPLETELY MADE UP OF ELDERLY  
 PEOPLE. THIS MEANS THAT THE TEAM      
 CONSISTS OF YOUNG PEOPLE FROM OUTSIDE 
 THE VILLAGE, SO THERE IS LITTLE LOCAL 
 COMPETITION TO BE IN THE TEAM.        
  SEVERAL SOMERSET PLAYERS HAVE PLAYED 
 FOR THE TEAM, WHICH HAS ONLY EVER WON 
 1 COMPETITION, THE SOMERSET           
 COMPETITION. THE CLUB IS NOW IN THE   
 WILTSHIRE LEAGUE. THE TEAM GOES ON    
 TOURS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND MANY   
 TOURING TEAMS PLAY AGAINST THEM, e.g. 
 LEEDS POLICE AND RADLEY COLLEGE.      </content>
