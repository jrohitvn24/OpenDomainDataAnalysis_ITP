Tourists visit the area as Earl Spencer owns much of this land, Holdenby is the notable exception.  From Spratton it is possible to see the neighbouring villages of Brixworth and Chapel Brampton.  Holdenby House was built by Sir Christopher Hatton, Lord Chancellor to Queen Elizabeth 1 it was the largest house of its age and was originally eight times its present size.  Visitors to Holdenby House can visit the falconry centre where they can experience flying birds of prey.  In the surrounding villages of Creaton and Brampton, there are two stately homes that are now popular venues for weddings and business conferences, Highgate House and Sedgebrook Hall.  Spratton has a blend of traditional local stone buildings and contemporary housing.  The landscape of the area is very pleasing to the eye, with rolling hills and many trees adding interest to the view.   &lt;br />
