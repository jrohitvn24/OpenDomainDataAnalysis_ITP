		<content> Six years ago members of Pevensey     
 Parish Council and Age Concern decided
 to start an{Information and Caring    
 Centre,funded by contributions from   
 local organizations and the County    
 Council.It is in rooms opposite the   
 Health Centre in the middle of        
 Pevensey Bay.The Centre is{manned     
{morning and afternoon in the summer   
 and{mornings only in the winter}by 25 
 volunteers.Each year they have about  
 6000 enquires mainly about{tourism    
 from summer visitors and about{aspects
{of welfare}from residents .There is a 
 large range of{free leaflets}with all 
 kinds of information,places to visit, 
 benefits that can be claimed and      
 safety hints.They never run out of    
 leaflets as supplies are delivered    
 each week.Although the range of       
 information wanted is very wide they  
 are never unable to answer questions. </content>
