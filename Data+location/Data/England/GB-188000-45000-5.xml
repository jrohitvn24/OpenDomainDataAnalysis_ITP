		<content> The Churches in Probus contd.         
 Both Anglican &amp; Methodist churches    
 provide various services for the      
 community even if they no longer play 
 an intergral part in village life.The 
 Anglican church has about 20 weddings 
 &amp; 10 funerals a year with increasing  
 numbers of baptisms.It does not lead  
 community activities but encourages   
 people to join village groups         
 eg.Womens Institute.The first Sunday  
 after july 5th is celebrated as St.   
 Probus Feast Day no longer a village  
 holiday,but still with aspecial       
 service &amp; also cocerts,arts &amp; crafts  
 exhibitions or a flower festival are  
 held,although this year there are     
 none.The Methodists have several      
 groups,not only for methodists,meeting
 in their school room eg. playgroup &amp;  
 aerobics &amp; their church members play  
 an active part on various committees. </content>
