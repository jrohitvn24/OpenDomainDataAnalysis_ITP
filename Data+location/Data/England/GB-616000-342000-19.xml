		<title>19BLACK SHUCK.</title>
		<content>{Black Shuck}is supposed to be a large 
{black dog}that{roams the cliffs}from  
 Beeston Regis Church to Bacton Church 
 looking for its{two masters drowned}at
 sea, one buried in each churchyard. It
 is said to have{one blazing eye}in the
 middle of its forehead, and if you see
 it it's a sign of{impending death.    
   The old Sheringham{smugglers}used   
 this{legend}to keep the public away   
 when they were on a smuggling run at  
 Beeston.  They used a{Shetland pony,  
 hung a{lantern}between its ears,      
 attached it to a long line and ran the
 pony as the "Old Shuck" of the legend 
 all along the cliff until the smuggled
{cargo was landed}and safely got away. 
   Several poems have been written on  
 this legend and there are variations  
 of the story to be found in other     
 parts of Norfolk.
