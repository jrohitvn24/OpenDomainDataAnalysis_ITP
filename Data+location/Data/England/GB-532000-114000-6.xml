		<content> The old Ditchling Primary School      
 turned into a Museum in l985 maintains
 its contact with today's children     
 every Sunday morning when the Sunday  
 School meets there in the Museum      
 cafeteria.The children aged 3_10 hear 
 Bible Stories and sing some of the    
 choruses their grandparents might have
 sung _ and some new ones too!They     
 enjoy drawing and making figures from 
 plasticine and pipe_cleaners.Every lst
 Sunday the Sunday School joins in the 
 l0 a.m.Eucharist Service in           
 St.Margaret's Church when the children
 read prayers they have written        
 themselves and often perform a short  
 play _ this month they did "Zacchaeus 
 in The Tree" and before that "Noah's  
 Ark"_each child wearing an animal     
 mask.At Christmas the Sunday School   
 perform a nativity play.This year the 
 children collected money for Ethiopia.</content>
