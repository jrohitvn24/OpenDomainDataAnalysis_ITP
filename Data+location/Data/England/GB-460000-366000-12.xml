		<title>12EDWINSTOWE FIRE STATION</title>
		<content>     The{volunteer part-time firemen of
{Edwinstowe}have an emergency room     
 which is reached by telephone or      
 telegraph.Details are written down and
 then the volunteers are called in by  
 radio operated bleepers they carry.Any
 firemen who can, hurry to the Station 
 to change into their black and yellow 
 uniforms and safety helmets.          
     Each uniform has an individual's  
 name in and they collect two discs    
 with their name on so the duty officer
 knows who is on duty.Then it's away to
 answer calls usually in Edwinstowe but
 also to large fires in places like    
 Retford.                              
     In hot dry summers the greatest   
 danger is{forest and heath fires}the  
 last serious one being in 1976 when a 
 lot of the forest was destroyed. There
 is a fire-tower in the forest to check
 for smoke.                            </content>
