		<title>15AN ASIAN SUNDAY</title>
		<content>On Sunday mornings I get up at 8.30 and
then I put on my best clothes. Before I
go out I have have a cup of tea and    
some bread.We go to the Guru Nanak     
Satsang Sikh Temple  as a family.When  
we arrive, we remove our shoes and     
everyone has to have their heads       
covered by material.We go into the     
Temple and pray.Then we put some money 
into a gold box,sit down on the floor  
and listen to the men singing holy     
songs on the stage.Men and boys sit on 
one side and the women and the girls   
sit on the other.After about an        
hour,the reader will say something     
special from our holy book-The Guru    
Granth Sahib.We all kneel and put our  
foreheads to th floor to show respect. 
We go to have something to eat in      
another room but the service still goes
on. We talk to friends and then go     
home.                                  </content>
