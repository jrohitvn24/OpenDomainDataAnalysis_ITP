		<content>  A major{industry}in the area is      
 quarrying.  The quarries include:     
 'Wimpey' which is 200 feet deep,      
 'Back Lane' which is 150 feet deep,   
 'High Road' which is 100 feet deep and
 'Tarmac' which is 200 feet deep all   
 the way round.  'Tarmac' makes tarmac,
 'High Road' makes breeze blocks, slabs
 and paving and 'Wimpey' and 'Back     
 Lane' produce tarmac and stone.  At   
 each quarry they have shelters for the
 man who blasts.  The time for each    
 blast is always from 12 noon to 1 p.m.
  We can hear the blast from our school
 which is about  half a mile from the  
 nearest quarry.  Much machinery is    
 used including: JCB (diggers),        
 hoppers, a crane bomb, a crusher,     
 dumpers, loading shovels and diggers. 
 The crushers are machines that crush  
 the blocks into the sizes which are   
 required.                             </content>
