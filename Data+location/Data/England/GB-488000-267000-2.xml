 The people interviewed represented    
 nearly all possible age-groups,       
 although there was a high percentage  
 of young people. The vast majority of 
 people had moved from the surrounding 
 area (Northampton, Kettering, Bedford)
 although one family emigrated from    
 Rhodesia when it became Zimbabwe.     
 They had lived on the estate for      
 anything between 18 months and 14     
 years. Most people are happy with the 
 locality and the only complaint was   
 that there is no local shop. Most     
 people shop in central Wellingborough 
 and all except one had a car. The     
 majority like the peace and           
 tranquility of the estate and were    
 delighted not to be living in the town
 centre. Few people could think of     
 areas to improve Redwell Grange.
