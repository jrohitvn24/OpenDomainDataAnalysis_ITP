		<title>05Housing in Woodlesford</title>
		<content> There is a large variety of housing in
 the Woodlesford/Oulton area.The oldest
 houses are on the Aberford road which 
 was where Oulton clustered round until
 about fifty years ago.For that was    
 when Oulton really started            
 developing.Some of the old houses have
 the dates of when they were built on  
 them,one of them dating back to       
 1699.Most of the old houses are made  
 of sandstone which was quarried in    
 Oulton.The newest houses in           
 Oulton/Woodlesford are the North Lane 
 estate houses which were built only   
 15_16 years ago.There are private     
 houses,and there are also council     
 houses in the old North Lane estate   
 which were built on land formerly     
 owned by the Calverly's who built them
 between the Great Wars.
