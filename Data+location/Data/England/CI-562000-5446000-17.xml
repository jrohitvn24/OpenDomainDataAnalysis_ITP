		<title>17TRAFFIC IN ST.HELIER</title>
		<content>   The volume of traffic in the town   
 area is becoming a major cause for    
 concern. The number of vehicles is    
 increasing all the time (in 1981      
 there were some 36133 cars).          
   Jersey has several unique traffic   
 features. There is an all island speed
 limit of{40mph;}some junctions have a 
 sign reading{Filter in Turn}which     
 means you should take your turn with  
 any other vehicles joining a stream of
 traffic. As in Britain we drive on    
 the left, but the law says that       
 drivers should give way to horses.    
 The traffic lights have a different   
 sequence with no amber light          
 preceding the green. Another          
 distinctive feature on Jersey roads is
 the number of cars which carry a{red H
{plate}showing that they are hire      
 cars. There are over 4,500 of these   
 "horror" cars as the locals call them.</content>
