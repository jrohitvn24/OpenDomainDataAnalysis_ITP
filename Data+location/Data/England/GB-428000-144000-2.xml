		<content>   The area contains parts of a number 
 of Parish Councils: Amport, Thruxton, 
 Fyfield, Monxton and Penton Mewsey.   
   The Councils meet once a month to   
 discuss matters of local interest and 
 importance.                           
   The type of item that would appear  
 on a normal agenda would include      
 Planning Applications, the upkeep of  
 Public Facilities for which the       
 Council is responsible, such as bus   
 shelters and children's play          
 equipment, the general tidiness of the
 parish, the maintenance of footpaths, 
 protection of trees, local monuments, 
 listed buildings, etc., and council   
 finances.                             
   Councils vary. Amport is one of the 
 largest parishes in the area with an  
 electorate of approximately 900 people
 and a council of ten. Monxton, with an
 electorate of 280, has five members.  </content>
