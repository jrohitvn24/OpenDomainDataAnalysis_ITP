		<title>01LICHFIELD EAST</title>
		<content>   The area contains the eastern half  
of Lichfield,including part of Stowe   
Pool.Two of Lichfield's ancient        
churches,St.Michael's on the Greenhill 
and St.Chad's are within its boundary. 
   Lichfield's main industrial estates 
are in the area,alongside the Stafford 
to London railway line.In the south of 
the area large tracts of farmland have 
been built-over within the last 5      
years.Even so,8 of the 12 survey       
squares are still mainly farmland.     
   A new by-pass road crosses the area 
from south-west to north-east allowing 
through traffic to avoid the city.The  
Coventry Canal runs from north to south
through the east of the area.A small   
hamlet,Huddlesford,lies close to the   
canal in the south-eastern corner of   
the survey area.
