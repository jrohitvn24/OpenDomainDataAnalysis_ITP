		<content> This area is bounded by the B3047 to  
 the north and the A31,which runs      
 through the southern portion of the   
 area. People living in this area have 
 to make their way to a bus stop on    
 either of these roads if they wish to 
 catch a bus to either Winchester or   
 Alresford/Alton. Along the B3047 there
 are 23 buses daily to Alton and 19 to 
 Winchester. Along the A31 there are 10
 buses to Winchester daily and the same
 number to Alton. It is also possible  
 to catch a bus to Petersfield from    
 the 'Percy Hobbs'. There are 7 buses  
 daily to Petersfield and 8 in the     
 opposite direction.                   
 NB The statistics given are Summer    
 Timetable. Services are not so        
 frequent in the Winter. Most          
 people,however,have their own motor   
 car, as buses are expensive in rural  
 areas. (60 pence for three miles)     </content>
