		<content> At the time of writing the lot of the 
 dairy farmer is governed to a large   
 extent by milk quotas and prices set  
 by the E.E.C.The arable farmer,on the 
 other hand,can sell to anyone for the 
 best price he can get.With the use of 
 chemical fertilisers and help from the
 weather Mr.Dickinson has pushed his   
 yield per acre up from one and a      
 quarter tons to three tons.Following  
 the planting the first pest to attack 
 the crop is mildew.This is followed by
 leather jackets(crane fly             
 lava).Chemical sprays and slug pellets
 are used to attack these.In the Spring
 fertiliser(nitrogen) is added to the  
 crop.Harvesting begins in July with   
 the winter barley,followed by oats and
 wheat.Often farmers work up to        
 nineteen hours a day during harvest   
 time.crops are rotated to preserve the
 goodness in the soil.                 </content>
