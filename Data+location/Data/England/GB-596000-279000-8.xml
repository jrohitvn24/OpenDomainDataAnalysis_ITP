		<content> Hopton is a very quiet village.  It   
 has many shops and activities such as 
 an Art Gallery and a Pottery shop.    
 The village shop provides most of the 
 groceries.  There is one primary      
 school and a playgroup.  The village  
 has its own doctor.  There is one bus 
 daily which takes workers to Bury St. 
 Edmunds.  The houses in Hopton are    
 mostly old; there are 12 old people's 
 bungalows.  All Saints Church has an  
 average congregation of 40 people.    
 There is a pantomime every year and an
 old people's club, a youth club,      
 concerts and fetes.  The surrounding  
 countryside is mostly for growing     
 crops.  Many residents of Hopton are  
 employed on the surrounding land, at  
 Riddlesworth Hall and in Diss,        
 Thetford and Bury St. Edmunds.
