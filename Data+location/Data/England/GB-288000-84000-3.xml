		<content> THE VILLAGES OF KENN AND KENNFORD ARE 
 SURROUNDED BY NUMEROUS SMALL FARMS.   
 THEY ARE TYPICAL OF MANY FARMS FOUND  
 IN THE COUNTY. THEY ARE USUALLY FARMED
 BY A FAMILY. THE FARMERS WIFE OFTEN   
 TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE TOURISTS TO THE
 AREA BY OFFERING BED AND BREAKFAST    
 ACCOMMODATION IN THE LARGE FARMHOUSE. 
 THE FARMS ARE MIXED,HAVING            
 CATTLE,SHEEP,PIGS AND POULTRY AS WELL 
 AS GROWING CROPS SUCH AS WHEAT,OATS   
 AND BARLEY. BECAUSE OF THE RICH       
 PASTURE LAND THESE FARMS ENJOY,THE    
 CATTLE IN THE MAIN ARE DAIRY CATTLE   
 KEPT FOR THEIR MILK. FINE BUTTER AND  
 CLOTTED CREAM ARE THE PRODUCTS OF THIS
 INDUSTRY.THERE IS A CATTLE MARKET IN  
 EXETER ABOUT 5 KMS AWAY WHERE FARMERS 
 BUY AND SELL THEIR ANIMALS. SOME FARMS
 SELL POTATOES AND OTHER VEGETABLES TO 
 PASSING MOTORISTS.
