		<title>17A TRESWELL FAMILY</title>
		<content> HELLO! Our names are Frances and      
 Norman Shaw.We go to Rampton Primary  
 School.In our family there is Mum,    
 Dad, six brothers and three           
 sisters.Our house is in Treswell, at 5
 Orchard Rise. This is a terrace of    
 quite modern houses and ours has five 
 bedrooms.                             
   There are about 80 houses in this   
 lovely village but the roads are quite
 busy as it is a route to the power    
 stations and Rampton Hospital.        
   In our house we have a computer,    
 video, sewing machine, two remote     
 control television sets, two automatic
 washing machines, a tumble drier and a
 micro-wave oven.                      
   In our garden we keep fifteen hens, 
 a cockerel and a dog. We are getting a
 cat very soon.
