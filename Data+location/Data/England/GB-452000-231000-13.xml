		<content> A Post Office is located in a General 
 Store in the High Street. Another     
 General Store is situated a few yards 
 away in the small square at the bottom
 of Wheeler's Rise.  An old public     
 house now houses Croughton Antiques,  
 catering  mainly for the US community.
 Milk is delivered from Banbury, and   
 daily and Sunday newspapers are       
 delivered by arrangement.  Mobile     
 butcher/green grocer, fishmonger and  
 fish 'n chip van visit the village,   
 and the Tredwells, who farm at        
 Astwick, beside the base, have a      
 butcher's shop in King's Sutton, and  
 will deliver meat to Croughton        
 customers.  A mobile library visits   
 fortnightly, stopping at either end   
 and the centre of the village. The    
 proximity of Brackley and Banbury and 
 the high level of car ownership means 
 that people mainly shop in town.      </content>
