 This area is dominated by the         
 River Teign which enters from the     
 west through a deep wooded gorge.The  
 river banks are kept as a nature      
 reserve with public paths.It          
 is a noted beauty spot,especially in  
 spring when covered with wild         
 daffodils.The route from Exeter to    
 Dartmoor passes through from east     
 to west and the river was best forded 
 through shallows at the end of the    
 gorge.The nearby picturesque village  
 of Dunsford is believed to take it's  
 name from the ford in the woods.The   
 surrounding area is mainly intensively
 managed grassland with patches of     
 woodland and some crops.The farms are 
 generally about 100-300acres.The land 
 is hilly but with a wide strip of flat
 pasture by the side of the river.
