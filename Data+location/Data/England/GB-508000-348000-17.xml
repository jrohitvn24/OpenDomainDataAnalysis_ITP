		<content> COMMUNICATIONS through the area are   
 fairly good as we have in the village 
 a railway station  enabling any one   
 from the area to go away by train .   
           They may also get to the    
 railway station  by car as there are  
 good road ways to and from the        
 station.                              
          The road system in the area  
 is important as it also allows local  
 people to travel to the town or city  
 which could be over 45 miles away.    
          Roads are important as well  
 because those people without their own
 transport can use the local bus       
 service that passes through the       
 villages about once per hour daily.
