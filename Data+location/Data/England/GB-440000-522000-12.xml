		<title>12THE POLICEMAN</title>
		<content> In our estate of Roseworth in the     
 "BLOCK" we have a policeman on the    
 beat His name is P.C.Harrison and he  
 is our{community policeman.}We had a  
 visit from the police to our school   
 for a week and they showed us many    
 things including truncheons and       
 radios. The police keep{law and order 
 and are also our{friends}in times of  
 emergency or when we are in trouble.  
 Policemen have dogs to help them find 
 criminals because they have a better  
 sense of smell.Each rank in the police
 has a different badge and every police
 officer has a different number on the 
 shoulder of his uniform.{Policewomen  
 are also employed doing the same job  
 as policemen. Police also use horses  
 when there are large crowds or a      
 procession. I stroked a police-horse  
 and gave him an apple when the police 
 came to visit us.                     </content>
