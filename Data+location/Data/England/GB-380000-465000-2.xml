		<title>02HOUSING IN LANGCLIFFE (1)</title>
		<content> The population of Langliffe has not   
 greatly increased over the years, so  
 it does not contain many modern       
 houses. Those which have been built   
 recently have been made to keep in    
 with the character of the village.    
 Consequently, there are very few      
 houses in Langcliffe which are built  
 of brick.                             
                                       
 The traditional housing of the area is
 exemplified by one of the oldest      
 buildings in Langcliffe. It is over   
 300 years old and stands behind the   
 fountain in the middle of the village.
 The building is low, with a stone roof
 and tall chimney stacks at either end.
 It still has the original irregular,  
 small mullioned windows.              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
