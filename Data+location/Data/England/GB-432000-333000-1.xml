		<content>    This is a predominantly urban area 
 with contrasting types of housing and 
 people from a variety of classes and  
 cultures. In the North East lies part 
 of the city centre which contains     
 shops and offices and the Derbyshire  
 Royal Infirmary.{The pattern of       
{housing is changing;}old inner city   
 terraces are being demolished and     
 replaced by modern semi-detached      
 houses and flats many of which are for
 old people. At the edge of the city   
 land is gradually being taken over for
 modern suburbs. Apart from a large    
 metalworks there are only small       
 workshops. Other important changes    
 currently taking place are the        
 extension of the city's hospitals and 
 the growing number of places of       
 worship for different religions.
