		<content>the recent teachers dispute all        
practises during lunchtime and after   
school have been cancelled.            
   There isn't an enforced school      
uniform,people wear what they want.The 
school regulations aren't all that     
strict,however if you do get into      
trouble you are seriously punished.    
   I think that this school is one of  
the best in Staffordshire.This is      
because of the efforts made by both    
staff and pupils alike.
