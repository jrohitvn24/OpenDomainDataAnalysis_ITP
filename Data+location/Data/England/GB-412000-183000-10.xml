		<content> My computer is a Sinclair Spectrum 48K
 which cost Â£120. I spend an hour on it
 every day, organising things like my  
 stamp collection, playing games and   
 learning French. Many families have a 
 computer of some sort today. The      
 Spectrum is popular because it is     
 quite powerful, can do many things and
 is good value. It is made by the      
 inventer Sir Clive Sinclair who       
 revolutionised British computer       
 electronics in the 1980's.

 My favourite game is draughts. It is  
 played on a board with 64 black and   
 white squares. Two players have 12    
 counters (men) each. The men can only 
 move forwards to the other side of the
 board to become Kings. A man is taken 
 when jumped.The loser has no men left.
