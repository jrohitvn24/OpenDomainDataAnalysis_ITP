		<title>04FARMING IN THE TEST VALLEY</title>
		<content>  The main occupation in the area is   
 farming.The area is typical of the    
 Hampshire Basin with mixed farming,   
 dairying and market gardening with    
 areas of woodland in between.         
  The climate is mild in winter and    
 warm in summer so that market         
 gardening flourishes.The mild climate 
 also benefits dairying.The grass grows
 for a long period so that less fodder 
 is needed.Cattle are kept inside in   
 winter.However it is necessary to     
 irrigate some of the pasture in summer
 by spray irrigation.                  
  Three examples of farming were       
 studied;a large modern estate farm,a  
 small mixed farm and a market garden. 
  Marketing the crops,especially the   
 horticultural produce is helped by    
 good roads through the area.
