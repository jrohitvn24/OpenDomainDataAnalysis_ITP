		<content>In the area we have Wootton Wood,      
Akeman street farm, Blenheim Palace    
Great Park and the northern part of    
Combe. Other farmhouses in our area are
part of Akeman St. Farm. Our area is   
mostly made up of arable farm land,    
parks and woods.                       
Akeman street runs right across our    
area. Akeman street is an old roman    
road which runs close to the site of a 
Roman villa.                           
Most of the people in our area live    
either in farm houses or in the north  
end of Combe.Some of them live on      
Blenheim Estate, in the lodges as      
workers.                               
Blenheim Palace is the family home of  
the Marlboroughs and whilst the palace 
itself is not in our area the estate   
takes up about half of our 12 sq.Km.
