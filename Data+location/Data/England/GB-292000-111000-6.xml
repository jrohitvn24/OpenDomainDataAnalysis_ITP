		<title>06Tiverton Market/Shopping</title>
		<content> Tiverton's Market Place is in the     
 centre of town.  It is a car park too.
  The main Market Days are Tuesday and 
 Friday.  There has been a market in   
 Tiverton since the 13th Century and it
 has helpedthe town to grow.  Livestock
 is sometimes bought and sold there but
 most people go for the ordinary       
 stalls.   Stallholders come from all  
 over the West Country to sell food,   
 clothing, gifts etc.  Market Days are 
 always busy in town - some country    
 families only ever come into Tiverton 
 on Market Day.                        
 There are many other shops in the town
 centre but a new hypermarket called   
 "PRESTO'S" is likely to change trading
 in the future.  It has recently       
 started business on the western edge  
 of town and smaller shopkeepers say it
 is taking away their business and     
 keeping people out of the town centre.</content>
