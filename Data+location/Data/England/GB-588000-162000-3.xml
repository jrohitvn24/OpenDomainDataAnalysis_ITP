		<content> P.C.Wells is a police officer who     
 works in the Juvenile Bureau.He has   
 been in the force for 18 years and is 
 an everyday sort of person.He said    
 that "protection of life and property;
 prevention of crime and prosecution of
 offenders" are his main duties.The    
 main crime in Sittingbourne is        
 robbery.Over 1000 different crimes    
 were committed last year in the area. 
 The'Grove',Murston and schools have   
 the most problems.Drug abuse has      
 increased with port facilities at     
 Sheppey.In and average Sittingbourne  
 week there are 10.12 burglaries.      
 Fortunately there are not many        
 muggings.104 children were arrested   
 for crimes last year.About 10 bicycles
 are stolen each week,most of them     
 without a post-code.There are 6 cells 
 at the station which are seldom all   
 occupied at once.                     </content>
