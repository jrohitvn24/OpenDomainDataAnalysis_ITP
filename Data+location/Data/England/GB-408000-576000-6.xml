		<title>06A DAY IN THE LIFE OF SARAH</title>
		<content>   I don't like getting up in the      
 mornings so my Mum has to pull off my 
 covers before I will get out of bed.  
 My breakfast,rice crispies, is usually
 ready on the table and I eat it with  
 my Mum, Dad and sister. I sometimes   
 get cross at breakfast because my Dad 
 teases me. I practice my spellings and
 play with my dog until Mum tells me   
 that it's time to go to school. My    
 older sister Suzanne has to be at the 
 road end earlier than me for her bus  
 to the High School so Mum or Dad take 
 us both by car and I sit and wait for 
 Norman the taxi-driver. I am at       
 school before most of my friends so I 
 wait for them by the hedge. I like    
 Maths at school, but I'm not very     
 good. I have a packed lunch that I    
 bring from home every day. After      
 dinner we do painting or sewing or    
 drama or I go on the computer.        </content>
