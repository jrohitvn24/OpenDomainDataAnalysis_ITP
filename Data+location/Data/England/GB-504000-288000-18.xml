		<title>18ASHTON - ARCHAEOLOGY</title>
		<content>     A Roman town once existed beside  
 the River Nene at Ashton. In recent   
 years there has been a lot of         
 excavation on the site by pupils from 
 Prince William School, Oundle and     
 others organised by the Nene Valley   
 Archaeological Group.                 
     There were initially no visible   
 signs of the settlement, but          
 archaeologists then revealed the      
 foundations of buildings, pottery and 
 jewellery. Evidence now suggests that 
 the settlement once covered some      
 thirty acres of what then became      
 agricultural land. The remains also   
 extend below the site of the old      
 Oundle railway station where a series 
 of Roman burials have been found. The 
 construction of the Oundle bypass was 
 the spur to the most recent 'dig' for 
 which permision was given by the land-
 owner, the Hon.Mrs.Lane.              </content>
