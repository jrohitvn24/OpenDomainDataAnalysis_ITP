		<title>11LIFE-STYLE/A PERSONAL VIEW.</title>
		<content> This young couple live in Westerton,  
 the smallest community in the block   
 but with lives &amp; backgrounds similar  
 to many people living in the villages 
 today; moving in for personal reasons 
 but finding employment elsewhere-Chris
 is a long-distance lorry driver.      
 Theirs is a small neat stone terraced 
 house: small front garden &amp; rear yard.
 Whilst enjoying the quietness they can
 sometimes be bored: of the some 60 res
 idents many are retired. However their
 parents are quite close: Vannessa's in
 B/Auckland have DIY business, Chris' a
 confectioners in Coundon.             
 Westerton has no shop or pub, not even
 a mobile library, but there is a phone
 -box. Their doctor is at B/Auckland.  
 Apart from TV &amp; books, on Fri/Saturday
 they walk to the pub "two fields away"
 yet when asked about their live-style,
 "Yes we like it &amp; we intend to stay". </content>
