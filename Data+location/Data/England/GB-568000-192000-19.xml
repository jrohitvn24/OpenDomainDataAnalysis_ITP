		<content> Mr. Peter Elvy the vicar of Great     
 Burstead church was a journalist      
 before he was ordained. He began      
 working for Essex Radio four years    
 ago. He has two jobs, one as community
 -co-ordinator,the other as chaplain.He
 helped to raise Â£40 000 which was     
 spent on four mini-buses. He is in    
 charge of the religious output of the 
 station, organising two "Morning      
 Reflections" daily.These last one     
 minute and are given by various people
 to make a "quiet space" in a busy day 
 On Sunday evening he broadcasts Life- 
 line. People can phone and discuss    
 problems and advice is given.As       
 chaplain he marries members of Essex  
 Radio staff and baptises them too.On  
 one sad occasion, he buried one of the
 staff and comforted the family.
