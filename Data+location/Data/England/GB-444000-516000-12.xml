		<title>12THE RIVER TEES</title>
		<content> The {Tees}was a salmon river in the   
 first Domesday book,but since the{    
{Industrial Revolution}brought the     
 chemical and steel industries to its  
 banks, pollution stopped the salmon.  
 For ten years, the Water Board and    
 councils have been making rules to    
 clean up the Tees. The local evening  
 paper,the Gazette,reported on Monday, 
 May 16th.,1985,that a massive 2       
 million cubic metres of oxygen was to 
 be injected into the river.           
    The salmon are coming back now. In 
 fact there are so many that salmon    
 poachers are now at work.
