		<title>12The Post Office Ravensthorpe</title>
		<content>The Post Office,Ravensthorpe is housed 
in a most attractive white washed      
cottage.It was built in 1610 with mud  
walls and a local straw thatch,the     
extension added in 1875 provides accom-
adation for the post mistress &amp; family.
It plays an important role for the     
locals by giving a full postal service.
Here you can pay bills,keep savings and
collect weekly allowances or pensions. 
The post comes from Northampton - Mr   
and Mrs Hancox rise at 5.15am to sort &amp;
then deliver the mail.The paperboys    
deliver newspapers twice daily,the shop
also sells a variety of groceries,bacon
cheese,bread,sweets and tobacco.It is  
used more by people without their own  
personal transport.A recent local      
appraisal showed 69% use the shop regul
-arly,82% the post office.No changes   
are foreseen for the near future as    
small P.O.'s are to be protected.      </content>
