		<title>16Ponds In Woodchurch</title>
		<content> Some ponds are natural.Most of the    
 ponds in Woodchurch are man made.Some 
 were made as a source of water for the
 village .Farmers built ponds for      
 their livestock so they had lots of   
 water for them to drink.On large      
 estates ponds were used for           
 decoration.Some ponds are fed by      
 natural springs which come up cracks  
 in the Earth and keep the water level 
 up.Springs are usually in valleys and 
 not on top of  hills.Weeds ,insects , 
 birds and fish couldn't survive       
 without the pond.There are lots of    
 different types of weeds and          
 insects.We found waterboatman ,       
 pondskaters and water spider.There are
 waterweeds,fungus, and water lilies in
 the ponds.Fish like tench , roach and 
 rudd live in some of the ponds.{
