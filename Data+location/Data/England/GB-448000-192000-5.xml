		<title>05An Oxfordshire Farmer.</title>
		<content>    Mr. Caudwell has been farming      
 Oxfordshire land all his life as did  
 his father and his father before him. 
{He is a farmer who believes in looking
{after the countryside.}Instead of     
 ripping out hedges and creating a     
 dust-bowl he is replanting blackthorn 
 and whitethorn hedges. He explained   
 that economically it makes more sense 
 to plant a hedge which might have a   
 lifespan of 100 years as against      
 erecting barbed wire fencing which    
 only lasts for approximately 20 years.
 Mr. Caudwell is aware that he must get
 the maximum return for every acre     
 planted and to ensure this is the case
 he spends Â£60,000 a year on chemical  
 fertilisers and pesticides. Mr.       
 Caudwell is a modern farmer. We could 
 tell this because in his office there 
 was a computer. This is used for      
 keeping records of livestock and crops</content>
