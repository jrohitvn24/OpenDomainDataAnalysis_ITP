		<content>    My name is Mark Johnson. I am 10   
 years old and go to school in         
 Spalding.                             
    At 7 o'clock I get up. At 7.30 I   
 have my breakfast and then watch      
 television. I go to school at 8.30 and
 then we start school at 8.55.         
    At the start of the morning we have
 Assembly and then we have lessons in  
 Mathematics, English, and P.E.        
 Half-way through the morning we have a
 15 minute break.                      
    At 12 o'clock we have a lunch break
 until 1.10 . I take sandwiches to     
 school to eat at lunch time. During   
 the afternoon we useally do project   
 work and art and craft and listen to a
 story. We finish school at 3.30 and
