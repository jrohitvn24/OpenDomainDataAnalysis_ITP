		<title>20NEWCOMER'S VIEW OF CLAYPOLE</title>
		<content>       My family and I moved into      
 Tinsley Close, Claypole in June 1976. 
 Why you may ask, ten years later, am I
 writing as a newcomer to the village? 
       Many of the families in the     
 village have lived here for           
 generations: great grandparents,      
 grandparents, parents and children all
 still live in the area. A local farmer
 showed me a tree which he had just    
 planted and said "This will be no use 
 in my time but my grandchildren will  
 enjoy sitting under it."  What is ten 
 years in this time scale?             
       The building of Tinsley Close, a
 small cul de sac, was quite a cultural
 shock to this close knit community and
 the village became divided into two   
 camps, them' and 'us', old and new.   
 Slowly however both compromised; we   
 merged and the line became indistinct 
 and now we are part of the community. </content>
