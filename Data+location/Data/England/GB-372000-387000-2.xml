		<title>02DUNHAM MASSEY HISTORY.</title>
		<content> The house was built for George Booth (
 the second Earl of Warrington) in 1732
 by a little known architect called    
 John Norris. By the late 19th century 
 the house was in a terrible state of  
 neglect. The 9th Earl of Stamford     
 decided that the family should move   
 back to Dunham Massey, because the    
 house was in need of extensive repair.
 Compton Hall advised them to have the 
 elaborate stone centre piece given to 
 the south front which is still there  
 today. The 9th Earl of Stamford died  
 in 1910 and the house was given to his
 son Roger the 10th Earl of Stamford.  
 In  1976 at his death Dunham Massey   
 became property of the National Trust.
 When the Trust took over, the aim was 
 to restore the house to its former    
 glory, as the 10th Earl of Stamford   
 left it.
