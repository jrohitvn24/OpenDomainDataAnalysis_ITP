		<content> Shopping facilities are very limited  
 within the area, but residents can    
 shop well in the Medway Towns for all 
 major needs. There are two small rows 
 of shops in the area, providing basic 
 requirements only. Several premises   
 have closed down recently. It seems   
 that there is little demand for more  
 than newsagents, a petrol station,    
 simple food stores and postal and     
 chemist facilities in the immediate   
 vicinity.                             
 There is one private school as well as
 one infant, one junior and one        
 secondary school in the area, but     
 catchment areas overlap with other    
 parts of the Medway Towns.            
 There is also one sports ground,      
 though again, few facilities are      
 provided for organized sport in the   
 immediate locality.
