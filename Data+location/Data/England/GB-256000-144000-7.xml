		<title>07      LIFE IN 1935.</title>
		<content> We interviewed Mr.Darch,our school    
 caretaker,to compare life in Combe    
 Martin 50 years ago. In 1935 most of  
 the houses were the same size. But the
 houses that were been built at that   
 time were much larger. The school in  
 1935 was the same except for          
 equipment,size and space.The games    
 they played werenormal like Football  
 marbles, conkers, and skipping etc. On
 special occasions they went down the  
 bowling green and learned to swim in  
 the sea. There were many more shops in
 Combe Martin 50 years ago because     
 there are more cash and carrys in the 
 towns now. Life was similar in those  
 days except for TVs fridges computers,
 etc.Most people have a car now        
 days.Everybody today is better off    
 than in those days. The village has   
 changed a little, its got a little    
 larger and there are more .           </content>
