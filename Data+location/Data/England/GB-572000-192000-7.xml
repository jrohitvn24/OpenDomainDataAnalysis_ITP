		<content> Wickford, surprisingly has many       
 churches for the size of the town.    
 Most religions are closely linked to  
 christianity for there are, for       
 example, no Mosques, no Buddhist      
 temples and no Synogogues.The         
 religious buildings in Wickford are as
 follows: Three church of England,which
 are St. Catherines,St.Mary's and      
 St.Andrews.Five Inter-Denominational  
 churches which are the Jersey gardens 
 chapel,The Salvation Army,Assembly of 
 Godchurch,Wickford Gospel and the     
 Evangelical church.There are two      
 Baptist churches in Wickford as well  
 as Christchurch which is a United     
 reformed Methodists church.           
   Although we have school assemblies  
 when local reverends visit I don't    
 feel that the younger generations are 
 particularly religous.However older   
 people of the town are.               </content>
