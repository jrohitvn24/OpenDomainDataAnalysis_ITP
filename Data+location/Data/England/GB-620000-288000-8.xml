		<title>081st RETIREMENT TO PULHAM</title>
		<content> After 30 yrs in the army Wilfrid &amp; I  
 moved to Pulham North Green 8yrs ago, 
 looking for fresh air &amp; space to enjoy
 our animals.We run a boarding kennels 
 &amp; cattery,&amp; occasionally breed &amp; show 
 our own dogs,we keep other animals &amp;  
 enjoy the countryside on horseback.We 
 prefer home grown food &amp; at various   
 times have kept a cow,calves,pigs     
 poultry,&amp; grow fruit &amp; vegetables &amp;   
 preserve them;we use hedge row fruits 
 for jam &amp; wine.We have settled happily
 to our new way of life,working long   
 hours outdoors in all weathers &amp; our  
 neighbours have helped us to become   
 absorbed in the local community.On 2nd
 retirement,(not just yet)we hope to   
 explore our new county &amp; all East     
 Anglia &amp; have just purchased a boat to
 use on the Broads.
