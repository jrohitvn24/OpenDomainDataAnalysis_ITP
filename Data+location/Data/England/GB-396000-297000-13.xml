		<title>13Crime in Darlaston</title>
		<content>  We went out on the 14th of June 1985 
 to ask people some questions about    
 crime. We did it because we wanted to 
 know what people think about crime in 
 Darlaston. 75% of the people think    
 crime is out of control. Most people  
 think criminals don't care when they  
 have commited a crime. 70% of people  
 think judges are too lenient. The most
 frequent crimes in Darlaston are      
 Burglary,Vandalism, Hooliganism. 152  
 people were asked about crime. 42 had 
 crimes commited against them. The     
 criminal was not caught most of the   
 time. Here are the questions we asked.
 Have youn ever had crime commited     
 against you? Where did the crime take 
 place? Was the criminal caught?What do
 you think of the crime situation? How 
 do you think criminals feel when they 
 have commited a crime ?               
                                       </content>
