		<content>   Although the majority of the school 
 population is only in Oundle during   
 term-time, the school has an impact on
 the town throughout the year. It      
 provides work usually of a domestic   
 and secretarial nature  for local     
 residents. Older pupils from Prince   
 William School, the local             
 comprehensive, sometimes 'moon-light' 
 as waitresses and kitchen-staff in the
 evenings and early mornings.          
   The town also benefits from some of 
 the school's facilities like the      
 bookshop, and also the swimming-pool  
 and theatre which are not in our      
 block! It is true to say that without 
 the school Oundle would be a very     
 different town, particularly at lesson
 change times when schoolboys are      
 moving from one part of the town to   
 another because the teaching areas    
 are scattered all over the place!     </content>
