		<content>  Long Lawford village is surrounded by
 fields of mainly barley,rape,hay and  
 rough grazing.Dotted about in these   
 fields are many different breeds of   
 cattle sheep and other animals.There  
 is a main road (A428) which by-passes 
 the main part of the village.         
  Scattered throughout the area are    
 quite a few ponds,mostly situated in  
 corners of fields providing water for 
 livestock and for irrigation.There are
 only a few fields which have not been 
 sprayed with pesticides and so there  
 are few meadows with original wild    
 flowers in them.                      
  There are three railway lines running
 around the village, one used by Rugby 
 Cement Company the other two being the
 main lines between London,Birmingham  
 and Manchester.Close by flows the     
 River Avon.- A rural setting close    
 to the busy Midland town of Rugby.    </content>
