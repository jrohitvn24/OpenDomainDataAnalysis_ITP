		<title>15M1 &amp; DUNSTABLE ROAD JUNCTION</title>
		<content> The{M1}is the major road in our       
 square.It flows from London to Leeds ,
 carrying approx. 5330 cars and lorries
 per hour. The traffic in each         
 direction was about equal although the
 outside lane south was closed.        
 Roadworks are very frequent around    
{junction 11}at the moment as this was 
 one of the first sections of{motorway 
 to be built in the early 1960s. On our
 section there are approx .50% more    
 cars than lorries using the road. The 
{Dunstable Road}is a major trunk road  
 passing from the centre of Luton to   
 the centre of Dunstable. It is a duel 
 carriageway but has a speed limit of  
 40 mph because it is situated in an   
 urban area. There is no record of it  
 being built but it is thought to have 
 been an ancient track then a highway.
