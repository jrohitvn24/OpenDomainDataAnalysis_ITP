		<title>08Milking, High Tremeneer Farm</title>
		<content> The decision to give up milking at    
 High Tremeneer farm was made in the   
 year 1973. this was when the new bulk 
 collecting for milk was brought into  
 use. It was a large family decision to
 halt the milk process at Higher       
 Tremeneer farm. My Dad believed that  
 if he were to go into milk bulk       
 collecting the financial part would   
 be just too much. As we won the second
 farm at Georgia he felt that he would 
 have to pay to have extra workers. The
 reason being that himself would be    
 needed on the farm that we happen to  
 live on for milking. This meant,      
 losing all the profits through paying 
 his workers each week. And after a    
 large discussion with other family    
 members the final decision was made.  
 "Not enough profits would be made     
 through milking and in the dairy trade
 generally". he said.                  </content>
