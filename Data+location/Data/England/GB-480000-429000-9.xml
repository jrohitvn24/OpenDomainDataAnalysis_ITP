 have done this we have dinner time.   
                                       
 Dinner time lasts until one o'clock.  
 The dinner ladies let us in. We have  
 one lesson when we come inside and    
 after that we have playtime. We go    
 back inside at half past two and have 
 one more lesson before it is time for 
 everyone to go home at three thirty.  
 In the evenings I spend most of my    
 time watching television until five   
 o'clock and then I have my tea. At    
 half past five I do my piano practice.
 When I have done that I either go out 
 to play or stay in and watch          
 television.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
