 ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH                 
 In 1977 a do_it_yourself group began  
 work on a new Roman Catholic Church in
 Church Road.Before that Catholics had 
 worshipped in the British Legion Hall,
 then in Saint Luke's Church or gone to
 the nearest Roman Catholic Church in  
 Kelvedon some 3 miles away.The church 
 is called The Saint John Houghton     
 Catholic Centre after one of the      
 Catholic Martyrs.It was consecrated by
 the Bishop of Brentwood,The Right     
 Reverend Thomas MacMahon.             </content>
