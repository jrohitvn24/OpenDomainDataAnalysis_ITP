		<title>14MAKING STAIRCASES AT GLYNDE</title>
		<content>{Spiral Staircases}is a small family   
 firm that started in 1964 in an old   
 stable in Lewes employing 2 people.   
 Now it has 24 workers in an old       
 disused mill in Glynde. The firm found
 it would be cheaper to rent the mill  
 from the Glynde estates than set up in
 the town. The staircases are made of  
 metal, wood and perspex. The perspex  
 is moulded on wooden frames and then  
 heated. Some of the oak plywood treads
 are covered with veneer. The mill is  
 used as a workshop. There is a        
 woodwork room, metalworking room,     
 draughting and design and office. The 
 cheapest staircase is about Â£1000 to  
 Â£35000 for one 5 storeys high. 10% go 
 abroad, 60% to private houses and 20% 
 to shops, offices and banks. Many     
 staircases are exported to Saudi      
 Arabia and other places abroad. All   
 the staircases are for internal use.  </content>
