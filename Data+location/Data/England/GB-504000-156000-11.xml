		<content> Residents here, who have their own    
 polling station, vote for the four    
 main parties in a higher than average 
 turnout at all polls. The elected     
 Parish Council is actively concerned  
 with conservation, the Green Belt,    
 Public enquiries and Borough and      
 County Planning decisions. Public     
 meetings are held about these issues. 
 Previously, the electorate was        
 predominantly Tory but the Alliance   
 vote is increasing with a changing and
 less traditional population. There is 
 dissatisfaction with the Government's 
 handling of issues such as the future 
 of the Wisley/Ockham airfield.
