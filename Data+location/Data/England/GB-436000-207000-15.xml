		<title>15Witney Feast</title>
		<content> Witney Feast is a big fair which comes
to Witney every year. It comes at the  
end of September on Monday and Tuesday.
It is on the Leys. It starts at about  
5o'clock. People come from a 25 radius 
to it as it is very famous.            
 People from our class almost all went 
and about a third of them went on both 
days. People spent anything from one to
thirty pounds. There were at least 33  
big rides and dozens of side stalls.   
 The rides had strange names like "The 
Zipper", "Orbiter","Walzer","Ski-jump" 
The rides are quite long, early in the 
evening, and get shorter later on when 
more people come. You pay about 50pence
for about a minute and a half's ride.  
The old-fashioned up-and-down horse    
roundabout is very popular and must    
make about thirty pounds every two     
minutes. This ride is painted brightly 
and an old-fashioned organ plays.      </content>
