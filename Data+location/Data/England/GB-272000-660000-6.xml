		<content>{Carnbroe Estate                       
   Carnbroe Estate was built towards   
 the end of the 1960s.                 
   The first stage was a private       
 development then about two years      
 later the District Council built      
 houses on the rest of the estate.There
 are no amenities on the estate  but   
 there are two shops , 2 primary       
 schools and a playpark nearby.        
   The estate is across the North Road 
 from Bellshill Maternity Hospital.    
 North Road is the main "Escape Route" 
  from Bellshill. To the North it goes 
 to Coatbridge and joins the A8/M8     
 Glasgow to Edinburgh Motorway. To the 
 South it leads to Hamilton and the M74
 Motorway to the south.                
 I do not go out much on the estate    
 usually only on my bicycle, but even  
 with this there is nowhere to go.
