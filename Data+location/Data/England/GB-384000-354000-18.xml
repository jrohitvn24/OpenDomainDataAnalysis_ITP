		<title>18KIDSGROVE TOWN HALL</title>
		<content>    On Monday, June 17th.1985 we went  
to the Town Hall to find out what it   
was used for and how long it has been  
there.                                 
    The Town Hall is a large building  
in Liverpool Rd. It was built in 1897  
by Charles Cope, builders and the      
foundation stone was laid on April     
22nd. by John Smith,Chairman of the    
Council.                               
    There are 2 shields above the door 
with kids playing among trees. That is 
how Kidsgrove gets its name.           
    The Town Hall is used for paying   
bills,enquiries and Town Council       
meetings. There is also the magistrates
court and the Youth and Community      
Centre. Just across the road is a      
school built in 1853 and named after   
Thomas Kinnersley, a benefactor.
