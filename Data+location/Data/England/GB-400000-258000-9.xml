		<content> No-one appears to be entirely         
 self-sufficient although some grow    
 their own vegetables, sometimes one   
 lamb per year is kept to stock the    
 family freezer but other shopping is  
 done in nearby towns.  Milk papers    
 and post are delivered.  In winter    
 the lanes can become snow bound and in
 isolated areas a good stock of food is
 kept in for the winter.               
                                       
 Nearly all families have washing      
 machines, televisions and a proportion
 videos in addition to household       
 electrical gadgets.
