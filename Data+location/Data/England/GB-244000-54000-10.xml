		<content> My Dad is in the Army. He is a member 
 of{29 Commando Regiment,}stationed in 
 Plymouth. He has just been promoted to
 sergeant. I live in a{maisonette}built
 especially for{soldiers'}families.    
 There are about 24 families in the    
 block, which is part of the 'married  
 man's quarters'. My Dad takes the men 
 of his regiment on exercise to Norway 
 every year. Two years ago he went to  
 fight in the{Falklands conflict.}One  
 of his friends got shot in the arm and
 had to stay in hospital. Dad brought  
 me back two bullets for my necklace.  
 When he goes away it is usually for a 
 long time - about six months. Whilst  
 he is away my family miss him a lot   
 and worry about him. Some of my       
 friends' dads are usually away at the 
 same time.
