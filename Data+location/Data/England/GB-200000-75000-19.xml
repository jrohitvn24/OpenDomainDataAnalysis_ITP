		<title>19TRANSPORT.</title>
		<content> Since the public transport service in 
 our block is extremely limited,many   
 local people rely heavily on{THE ST.  
{KEW TAXI SERVICE.}This service        
 operates from St. Kew Highway and is a
 small family business. It has 4 cars  
 and 3 drivers who work about 12 hours 
 a day. Three cars are 4 years old and 
 one is new. The new car does about 5  
 journeys every day and averages about 
 100 miles using 4 litres of petrol.   
 The taxis are only used for short     
 journeys at a cost of 25p per mile    
 with reduced rates for children. The  
 taxis carry a lot of old people       
 without their own transport and are   
 used for weddings and funerals. The   
 taxis are serviced every month. {THE  
{LOCAL BUS SERVICE}provides transport  
 once a day to several nearby  villages
 and towns. Some extra services are    
 provided during school holidays.      </content>
