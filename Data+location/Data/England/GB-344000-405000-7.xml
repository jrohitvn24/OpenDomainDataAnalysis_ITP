 Crow Orchard C.P School is the oldest 
 school in our town. It dates from 1732
 and has been known as "The Endowed    
 School" because it was built with     
 money left in a will by Evan Smith,   
 dated the 8th September 1726.         
                                       
     The first headmaster of the school
 was Mr. James Eden and the next was   
 the Rev. Richard Aston.  No registers 
 were kept until 1877 when a log book  
 was started.  The school became very  
 overcrowded at about this time and the
 conditions were poor.  Some of the    
 items in the log book are quite funny:
                                       
   "John Martland sent to beg pardon   
 for stealing Mr. Berry's slate nails."
                                       
   "Joseph Birchall sent to beg pardon 
 for annoying people at a funeral."    </content>
