		<title>08HONING ECOLOGICAL ISSUES</title>
		<content> The Honing E.Ruston block contains a  
 comparatively high percentage of land 
 that is wood, tree and shrub covered. 
 It has not been subjected to the      
 widespread destruction and removal of 
 hedgerows and coppices as have other  
 parts of the county.There are tensions
 regarding conservation and the        
 economic use of land. A plan by land  
 agents wishing to maximise the        
 sporting potential of the Honing      
 estate to burn part of Crostwight     
 Common in order to deprive vermin of  
 cover caused an outcry - it is a      
 habitat of the rare golden oriole.    
 Also, should E.Ruston common remain a 
 large tract of scrubland or be        
 developed as a golf course, thus      
 maximising income. And should the Nth.
 Walsham/Dilham canal be dredged to    
 permit access to it by Broads hire    
 fleet cruisers?                       </content>
