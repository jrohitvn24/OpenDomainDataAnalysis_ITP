		<content>   Dorchester cemetery, on the Southern
 outskirts, is on the Weymouth road.   
 It was opened in 1856 and is managed  
 by the town's Joint Burial Committee. 
 It covers 7 acres and about 11,000    
 people are buried there. At the gate  
 is a lodge and just inside are two    
 identical stone chapels. The{North    
{Chapel}is being refurbished as a      
 memorial chapel and the{South Chapel  
 is used by all denominations. In the  
 SE corner is a group of ornate Italian
 marble statues erected by local{gypsy 
{families}such as the Penfolds and     
 Benhams. These graves are decorated   
 with artificial flowers and photos of 
 the deceased. Members of{prominent    
{local families,}eg the Popes and      
 Treves are buried here and there are  
 also some war graves in the cemetery. 
   Two more disused graveyards are at  
 churches in Came and Whitcombe.       </content>
