		<title>14THE CHURCH AT SHARDLOW</title>
		<content>   The church at Shardlow was built in 
 1838 by Thomas Cooper of Derby, three 
 years after the graveyard. Before that
 a church boat went along the canal    
 taking services and taking people to  
 Aston church. The church cost Â£4285   
 including six bells. The organ was    
 presented by Mr. Sutton of Shardlow   
 Hall. In 1839 the church was dedicated
 by the Lord Bishop of Ripon.          
   Now the church is used at 9am and   
 6pm on Sunday. The vicar is Rev.      
 Harding.                              
  The organist is Mrs. Cook. A group of
 bell ringers meet on Tuesday and play 
 before each service.                  
   Elvaston church was built in the    
 1200's. The services take place at    
 10:15am. At other times it is open for
 visitors who may go on a guided tour  
 of the church to see the monuments    
 etc. The warden is Mrs. Cooper.       </content>
