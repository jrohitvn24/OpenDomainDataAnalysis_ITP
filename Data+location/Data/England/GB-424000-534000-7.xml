		<content>   TUDHOE COLLIERY WAS ONCE A BUSTLING 
 COAL-MINING VILLAGE BUT IS NOW        
 COMPRISED OF A SINGLE ROW OF HOUSES   
 LINING EACH SIDE OF THE MAIN ROAD     
 LEADING NORTH TO CROXDALE &amp;           
 DURHAM. A SMALL INDUSTRIAL ESTATE NOW 
 OCCUPIES THE FORMER SITE OF THE       
 COLLIERY BEHIND THE HOUSES ON THE EAST
 SIDE OF THE ROAD.                     
   CROXDALE, 1/2MILE NORTH OF TUDHOE   
 COLLIERY, IS ALSO A FORMER COAL MINING
 VILLAGE BUT NOW THE WORKERS OF A      
 NEARBY FURNITURE FACTORY RESIDE IN    
 THE REMODERNISED TERRACED COLLIERY    
 HOUSES. THE OLD MAIN LONDON TO        
 EDINBURGH (A1) ROAD CUTS THROUGH      
 CROXDALE AS DOES THE PRESENT          
 NORTH-SOUTH MAIN RAILWAY LINE.
