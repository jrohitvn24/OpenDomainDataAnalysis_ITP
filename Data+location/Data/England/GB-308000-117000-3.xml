		<title>03The Parish Room</title>
		<content> The first Parish Room was an army hut 
 in the First World War.  It was       
 brought by train from London in l920. 
 In l98l they thought it was getting   
 old and scruffy so they decided to    
 build a new one.  In l984 it won a    
 shield, cup and Â£200 because it was   
 the best parish room in the south west
 of England.  Now there are lots of    
 things that go on in the Parish Room. 
 Mainly it is used for Playschool      
 which is held on Tuesday and Friday   
 mornings and Youth Club which is held 
 on Wednesday evenings.  There are     
 other things which go on in the Parish
 Room as well.  The discos are once a  
 month and old age pensioners go there 
 once a month for coffee mornings.     
 In the winter our school goes to the  
 Parish Room to do P. E.
