		<title>12Our School</title>
		<content> The school is about 150 years old. It 
 is built of hamstone and the roof is  
 made of tiles. It is a small school   
 with about 30 children divided into   
 two classes - one class called Infants
 and one called Juniors. The children  
 start at our school when they are 4 or
 5 and they leave when they are 9.     
 There are 3 classrooms in school. Two 
 classes are used for classrooms and   
 the other room is used as a dinner    
 room and TV room. We have a small     
 playground where we all play together,
 but in summer we can go up to our     
 school field where we can play games  
 like cricket and rounders. My school  
 is a nice place with lots of things to
 do. We make things, do painting,      
 numbers, writing and reading. My      
 school is colourful and warm.
