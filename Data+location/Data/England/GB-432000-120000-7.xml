		<title>07THE ELDERLY IN ROMSEY</title>
		<content> We found that some elderly people who 
 live in Romsey are very nervous of the
 younger generation.  Two elderly      
 people did not answer the door, two   
 opened the door, and seeing that we   
 were children, closed it again, and   
 one lady looked through her letterbox 
 before opening the door.  One man's   
 definition of Romsey was 'a nice town 
 with a good variety of shops, but     
 which are far too expensive'.  Most of
 the elderly people thought that Romsey
 would retain its character in the     
 future, but would grow much larger.   
 When we asked where they shopped, most
 said Carrefour, some in Waitrose and a
 few in Sainsburys.  Their main        
 transport is cars and buses.  When we 
 asked what they thought of all the new
 estates being built in Romsey they    
 simply replied, 'You just have to live
 with it'.                             </content>
