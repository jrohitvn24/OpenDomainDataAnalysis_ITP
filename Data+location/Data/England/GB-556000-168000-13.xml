		<title>13HORTON KIRBY PAPER MILLS</title>
		<content>   Built in 1820 this mill was origin- 
 ally a flour mill. After being con-   
 verted to paper making, a workforce of
 approximately 100 locals was employed.
 The paper made was good quality, used 
 for glossy magazines and Dyeline base 
 paper for copying plans. The mill,    
 then and still, uses pure water from  
 an Artesian well. Two chimneys were   
 used originally, the smaller being    
 demolished 20 years ago as it was no  
 longer required. The larger was built 
 in 1881 and had 35 ft. added by a     
 German firm in 1914. This amount was  
 removed for safety reasons in the     
 1970's. An overheated glazing cylinder
 exploded in the early 1980's, leading 
 to the rebuilding of the workshop. The
 paper mill now only produces woodchip 
 wallpaper, employing approx. 40       
 workers. 20 small firms rent units    
 from the mill and more are expected.  </content>
