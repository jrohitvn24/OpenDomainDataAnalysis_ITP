		<content>My Grandma and Grandad usually get up  
about 9.30am.They always have toast and
marmalade or lemon curd and cornflakes 
for breakfast.After breakfast Grandma  
starts cleaning the house and Grandad  
goes to get the bread and a "Daily     
Express" from the shops up the road.   
Then Grandad sits down and reads the   
paper.At about 11.00am Grandma and     
Grandad start to cook the lunch they   
nearly always have Yorkshire pudding,  
meat ,potatoes,carrots and gravy for   
lunch and for afters they have either  
apple pie or rice pudding.After lunch  
they go for a walk.In the afternoon    
they just take it easy.Grandad watches 
sport and Grandma knits.At 3.00pm they 
have tea and then they  watch T.V.     
until 10.00pm then they have supper and
go to bed at about 10.30pm.
