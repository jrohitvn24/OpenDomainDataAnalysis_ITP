		<content> St. James' Church, built of sandstone 
 and limestone, dates from late Saxon  
 times.The following additions have    
 been made;arches in 1200, a south     
 aisle in the 14th century a           
 Perpendicular-style Tower in the 15th 
 century, pews in 1821, which were     
 renewed in 1894, an Organ was         
 installed in 1844, a new Chancel in   
 1845 and an oak eagle Lectern in 1890.
 The Pulpit, dated 1907, incorporates  
 original Elizabethan carved panels.   
 Extensions of land given by the Earl  
 of Scarbrough were made to the South  
 in 1908 and East in 1969. In 1932, a  
 carved Altar and an octagonal Font    
 were added and electricity installed. 
 The Vestry Screen(1947) was made by   
 the 'Mouseman of Kilburn'.The Fleur de
 Lys motifs either side of the Altar   
 suggest that the mosaic floor may be  
 the original Norman floor.            </content>
