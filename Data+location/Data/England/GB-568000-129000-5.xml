		<title>05Ticehurst School - Past</title>
		<content>  Ticehurst school has changed since   
 the 1930's. It used to have outside   
 toilets and children attended between 
 the ages of five and fourteen. The    
 playground was split by a  wall to    
 separate the boys and girls but they  
 shared classrooms. When starting      
 school they used blackboard and chalks
 later they had pencils and then pens. 
  Most girls wore a gymslip with blouse
 or jumper, dark stockings with lace up
 shoes in winter, sandals and white    
 ankle socks in summer. The boys wore  
 short trousers until they left school.
 Sunday best clothes were usually for  
 Sunday school.                        
  The schooling was very strict. When  
 naughty, boys were caned on the bottom
 and girls on hand. There were about 40
 in each class and six classes. The    
 head was a full time teacher as well. 
 Most of the children walked to school.</content>
