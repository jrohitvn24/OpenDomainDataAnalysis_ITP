 His friend,who was Irish came too,    
 smoking his pipe. We went into the    
 first room.As we went in and breathed,

 and a murmur of{'M,m,m,'}went round.  
 The floor was covered with hexagons   
 like{honeycombs.}There were lots of   
 machines in this room;special knives  
 to clean the wax off the combs, a     
 whizzing machine to get the honey out,
 a bottler which looked like a big     
 lumpy microscope and could fill{1500  
 jars an hour.I thought it funny that  
 the Irish man was still smoking his   
 pipe when a sign said{"No Smoking"    
 most defnitely. We then went upstairs 
 to see the  enormous storage tanks    
 that{Brother Adam}had made himself and

 As we left he showed us the{500 yr old
 hives built into the original walls.  </content>
