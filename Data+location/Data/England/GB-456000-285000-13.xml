		<content> The tennis courts in Gilmorton were   
 built in the late 1960s.The money to  
 build them was raised by the          
 village.They stand on land leased from
 the Parish council.                   
 The Tennis Club was first formed in   
 May 1974 with a chairman,secretary and
 treasurer.                            
 The club now serves a membership of   
 approximately 70 to 80 junior and     
 senior members who live in Gilmorton  
 and the surrounding villages.The club 
 is responsible for general running    
 costs and maintenance of the          
 courts.Rent is paid to the parish     
 council each year.
