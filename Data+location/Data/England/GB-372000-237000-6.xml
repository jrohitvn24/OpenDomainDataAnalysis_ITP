		<title>06VILLAGE LIFE</title>
		<content>  The village has changed little since 
 the turn of the century.              
  The castle is now open to the public 
 on Wednesday and Sunday afternoons    
 during the summer months. Teas are    
 served at the castle. The grounds of  
 the castle have been skilfully planted
 over the years with a variety of      
 splendid and exotic forest trees.     
  Eastnor Park hasn't changed much in  
 250 years, apart from iron gates and  
 overhead power lines.                 
  Some houses have been modernised in  
 the village and tourists such as the  
 caravaners in the deer park arrive for
 weekends and rallies.                 
  St. Mary's Children's home has become
 a home for the elderly.               
  The village shop closed in March 1985
 because it couldn't make enough       
 profit. The villagers were travelling 
 by motor car to shop elsewhere.       </content>
