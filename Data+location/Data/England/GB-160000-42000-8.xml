		<content> To the South East of Coombe Valley is 
 the small business of a local         
 woodcutter.  This man has been cutting
 wood for 44 years.  He makes furniture
 such as dining-tables, stools,        
 dressers.  He makes things to order.  
 He gets his wood from St Blazes.  He  
 used some mahogany, which is expensive
 because of the disease that attacks   
 the wood.  He buys his screws in bulk 
 from out of the county, as this is    
 cheaper.                              
  His working hours vary.  He has no   
 assistants.  He learned his trade     
 working at Holmans, in Camborne, for  
 30 years, though he did not train as a
 carpenter.                            
  His amenities are adequate and he is 
 very happy living and working in      
 Cornwall.
