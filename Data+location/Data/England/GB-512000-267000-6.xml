		<title>06Housing at Perry.</title>
		<content>   During the 1970's a development of  
 over 200 single and double storey     
 homes were built south of Grafham     
 Water, either side of the Great       
 Staughton and Grafham Parish Boundary.
   Great Staughton named roads after   
 local residents such as Cowley and    
 Hawkins and after the farmhouse lost  
 under the water, Glebe Roundhouse.    
 Grafham named roads after 20th Century
 sailors such as Blythe and Rose.      
   As a result of pressure by the new  
 residents to become autonomous, the   
 Parish of Perry was formed in 1981.   
 Independence was only possible because
 of the revenue from the Water         
 Authority for the part of the parish  
 under water: a loss that Grafham and  
 Great Staughton fought.               
   There are 265 houses in Perry with  
 no future building planned save infill
 housing.                              </content>
