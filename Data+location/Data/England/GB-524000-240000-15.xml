		<title>15VICTORIAN COUNTRY HOUSE</title>
		<content>  After school we visited Elbrook      
 House. The House was built by The     
 Fordhams (who lived at the Bury) for  
 their son when he married in 1870. It 
 was eventually sold out of the family.
 It has changed hands twice since the  
 Second World War. The present owners  
 moved in in 1962. The mother of the   
 owner of Bluegates who we interviewed 
 lived there before she married. There 
 has been a great deal of interior     
 conversion. The kitchen has been moved
 nearer to the dining room. This is    
 interesting because when the house was
 built servants would have waited at   
 table. In modern times even people in 
 large houses cannot afford servants.  
 Large houses are sometimes divided up 
 into flats. There were two flats      
 here but now there is only the one in 
 what used to be the servants quarters.
