		<content>{The Camping Close}is the village green
 of Steeple Bumpstead and lies between 
 the Church and Bower Hall Drive.  This
 land used to be owned by{Parsonage    
{Farm}now known as{The Gun House. }It  
 is thought that the name "Camping     
 Close" derives from the game{"CAMP"}a 
 ball game long popular in East Anglia 
 and first referred to in a deed in    
{1486.}It was regarded as manly and    
 healthy exercise which was also good  
 for the{pightel or meadow.}The game is
 similar to rugby but using a small    
 round ball and goals made up from the 
 cast off clothes of players pitched   
 150 yards apart.  A goal is called a  
{"snotch"}and if a player is caught    
 with the ball he loses a "snotch".  A 
 game ends when 7 or 9 "snotches" are  
 scored and can take 2 or 3 hours. The 
 Close has a recently built{Pavilion;  
{Football and cricket}are now played.  </content>
