		<content>     There is good health care in      
 Culcheth.  We have three doctors at   
 the Surgery at the bottom of Jackson  
 Avenue.  There are two Dentists,      
 Mr.Johnson and Mr.Cockbain, in the    
 Dental Surgery in Hob Hey Lane. There 
 is also a Dentist at Swallow Court and
 an Optician's on Common Lane. There   
 are two Chemists in the village,      
 and a Clinic where you can go for     
 Chiropody and a few other things. The 
 Clinic is on Jackson Avenue next to   
 the Cub Hut.{                         
{  }If you have an accident and need to
 go to the Hospital you will be taken  
 to Warrington General Hospital.  There
 is a good Ambulance Service in the    
 Warrington area, run from a central   
 depot in Farrell Street. {
