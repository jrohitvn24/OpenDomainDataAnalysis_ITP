      Mr Darker is Head of Social      
 Education and secretary of the Parent 
 Teachers Association (PTA).The school 
 has a very strong Parents Association 
 whose aim is to involve the school    
 with the community ,and raise money   
 for the school through raffles, fairs,
 and dances.                           
  Other activities through Mr Darker   
 are Spiral Youth Club (largest in     
 Doncaster with over 300 members),and  
 two 'Old Folks' Clubs,one for members 
 of the local 'Derby and Joan' club    
 ,and for any lonely old people in     
 the area. Dancing, slide shows, games,
 and discussions are put on for the old
 people aided by fifth form pupils from
 the High School.
