		<content> A group visited the old{Board School. 
 The new owners have lots of furniture 
 stored in the 5m. high schoolroom.    
 From documents, it was discovered that
{children started school at 3 years old
{and ended at about 13 years old.}They}
 did not have history, music or science
 and  the  only  maths  they  had was  
 arithmetic.  Excuses  for  absence    
 included snow, helping at harvest, and
 shooting parties or helping at  home. 
{The average attendance in 1885 was 75.
                                       
 Today,Chalton children go to          
 playgroups at Rowlands Castle and to  
 First School at Clanfield or          
 Blendworth. After attending Middle    
 School at Clanfield they go to        
 Horndean Comprehensive. The Children  
 travel by taxi. Two children attend a 
 private school at Compton.
