		<content> Boycott Farm First School was opened  
 in January 1969 to serve the five to  
 nine year olds living on the estate.  
 Seventeen children were admitted on   
 the first day and in two years the    
 school population had risen to 292.   
 Over the next six years, up to 1977,  
 the school roll reached its maximum of
 491, occupying 16 classrooms in the   
 building.  Since 1977, the 5 to 9 year
 old population on the estate has      
 declined and the school roll has      
 dropped to 263.  This has meant a     
 reduction in the teaching force       
 through retirement and redeployment   
 and the mothballing of unused         
 classrooms.  With the growth of the   
 population in the Droitwich area some 
 catchment area changes have been made 
 so that spare accommodation at the    
 school can be used.  The school roll  
 will now rise slowly again.           </content>
