		<title>06 FARMING - COTTAGE FARM</title>
		<content>{Cottage Farm}is one of the more recent
farming developments in the area having
been in existence only 5 years. It     
covers an area of 10 acres and rents a 
further 25 acres of grazing land.      
 There are 12 turkey sheds, an office, 
3 stores, 1 cattle shed and a butchers 
shop on the site.                      
 {Turkeys and beef cattle are reared   
for sale}. The turkeys are bought in as
day old chicks and are sold at 4-5 days
as "growers" or reared to maturity and 
sold for the table at Christmas.  Beef 
calves are bought locally at 1 week old
fattened for sale as freezer packs at  
about 24 months.                       
 The farm has one full-time employee   
and up to 20 part-time workers are     
taken on at Christmas-time.  A         
 part-time  butcher is also employed.  
 A grass crop is maintained for summer 
grazing and hay making.                </content>
