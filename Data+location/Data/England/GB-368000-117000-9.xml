		<content> The village of Henstridge has a       
 population of about 1000 people.It is 
 made up mainly of residential areas   
 but there is a trading estate         
 operating on the old airstrip.        
 There is always a lot going on in the 
 village considering its size and most 
 activities are very well supported.   
 As the village expands it meets the   
 larger village of Stalbridge which is 
 also mainly residential.              
 There is a great deal of concern at   
 the moment about the fall in numbers  
 at the village school as this prbably 
 means a drop in the number of younger 
 couples living in the village.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
