		<title>19THE KNUCKER HOLE</title>
		<content>                                       
 Knucker holes are supposed to be      
 bottomless.  According to local estate
 agents, fisheries department, the one 
 at the Decoy House, Lyminster, near   
 Arundel is only 30 feet deep, and fed 
 by a stray underground spring.  From  
 this pool, the Knucker Hole Trust     
 Fishery of Three Lakes takes its name.
 The word Knucker is descended from    
 Anglo Saxon 'nicor', a water monster. 
 Every knucker hole had its monster and
 local legend has it that the Lyminster
 monster was slain by a knight errant  
 whose tombstone, with no inscription, 
 but dating from medieval times can be 
 seen in Lyminster church.
