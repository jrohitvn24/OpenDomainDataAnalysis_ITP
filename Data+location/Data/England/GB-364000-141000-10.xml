		<content> Doulting Church is dedicated to{St.   
{Aldhelm}and has been restored and     
 re-built three times. In 1869 when it 
 was re-built last , the tower and     
 spire were completely re-built. The   
 church has got 6 bells but they can't 
 be rung. It has got a cross in the    
 churchyard. The church at Cranmore is 
 dedicated to{St. Bartholomew}and is   
 smaller than Doulting's church. It has
 got 5 bells, and it has also got a    
 cross in the churchyard. Both these   
 churches are looked after by the      
 vicars in Shepton Mallet: Revds.      
 Woolmer and Barton. Chesterblade's    
 church is dedicated to{St. Mary}and is
 part of{Evercreech}Parish. It has got 
 one bell and in 1926 when the ceiling 
 was restored they found the beautiful 
{oak}roof underneath it. It is a very  
 small church.
