  From St Catherine's Castle to Combe  
 Hawne there are three grassland       
 fields.One is a large barley field    
 above the valley near Coombe Beach.All
 around the edge of the barley field it
 has been trampled down by walkers.    
  From Coombe Beach down to Polridmouth
 there is a National Trust wood about 1
 kilometre long.                       
  Following the path up from           
 Polridmouth beach to the top of the   
 woodland we came upon a field of      
 potatoes half of which had been       
 harvested.There were many smaller     
 potatoes left lying on the ground.    
  The walk to the Gribbin Head from the
 Menabilly carpark is about 1 kilometre</content>
