		<content>  Before Councillor T. Monks requested 
 an{Olympic-size swimming pool}the     
 baths were just a leisure place. 20   
 years ago building began and it was   
 finished the following year at a cost 
 of Â£840000. Haydn Rigby, team manager 
 of the 1960 British Olympic Swimming  
 Team, persuaded the council to appoint
 a full-time coach. He coached the team
 himself until{Keith Bewley}arrived.   
  Since then the team has gone from    
 strength to strength. Six members of  
 the Wasps represented{Britain}in the  
{1984 Olympics}in Los Angeles: Nicholas
 Hodgson, Stephen Powlter, Ann Ogersby,
 Annabelle Crips, Gaynor Stanley and   
 the bronze medal winner for 400 metres
 freestyle,{June Croft.                
  Keith Bewley believes that the Wasps 
 will grow from being the best club in 
 Britain to the best in Europe.
