		<title>02 RELIGION ST.TERESA'S CHURCH</title>
		<content>  We live in Penwortham,and our local  
 Catholic church is St.Teresa's.Since  
1933 there have been 2 churches,the    
oldest has been converted into a parish
hall.Before the churches were built    
our parishioners went to mass at St.   
Wilfreds(Preston) or to St.Mary        
Magdalene's(Penwortham)                
 St.Teresa's became a parish in 1959   
and since then has grown tremendously. 
Most of our class attend mass here and 
the youth club,which is organised by   
the church,is popular with the All     
Hallows pupils.                        
 The church organises a wide variety of
clubs for all ages,including charity   
groups,sports clubs,and choirs.The     
junior choir has 25 members and is     
conducted by Mrs.C.Alexander.A few of  
the pupils at this school sing at the  
most popular mass-9.20am,on Sundays for
the choir.                             </content>
