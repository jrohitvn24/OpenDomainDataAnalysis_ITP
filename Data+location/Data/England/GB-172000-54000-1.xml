		<content> 1985 is the 150th anniversary of the  
 Great Western Railway.Perranporth     
 played its own part in this,by being  
 a most popular stop on the Chacewater 
 to Newquay branch line.The line was   
 first opened in 1903 and was closed as
 part of the economies made in 1963 by 
 "Beechings Axe".There were thirteen   
 stops on the line,which was eighteen  
 miles long.A full journey took 57     
 minutes.                              
  Many people in the village have fond 
 memories of the line.Often the guard  
 would hold the train for local people.
 Once a local joker turned the station 
 lights out at Perranporth and the     
 train whistled through without        
 stopping,much to the amusement of     
 everyone,including the local police.  
 Little remains now,apart from a       
 viaduct visible at Goonbell and the   
 restored station house at St.Agnes.   </content>
