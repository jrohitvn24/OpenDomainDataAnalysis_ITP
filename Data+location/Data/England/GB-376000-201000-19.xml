		<title>19A day in the life of Joanna.</title>
		<content>  My day begins at 7.30 a.m. when I get
 up, dress and have my breakfast of    
 cornflakes and toast. At 8.45 a.m. I  
 walk to school. I play with my friends
 until 9.00 a.m. when a whistle blows  
 for us to go in to assembly where we  
 sing and say prayers together.        
  After assembly we write stories,     
 practice handwriting or do maths. Some
 days we watch television programmes   
 connected with our work.              
  At 12.00 mid-day we have lunch in the
 village hall. Some children have      
 school dinners, some bring sandwiches 
 and others go home.                   
  After lunch we have games, art,      
 storytime, or music or we work on an  
 interest topic. At 3.30 p.m. we finish
 and go home.                          
  During the evening I play with my    
 friends and have my tea. At about     
 9.00 p.m. I have a bath and go to bed.</content>
