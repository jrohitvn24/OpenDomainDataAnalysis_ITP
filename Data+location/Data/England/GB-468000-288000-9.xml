		<title>09CRAFT AND INDUSTRY _FOXTON</title>
		<content> The industry and crafts of our area   
 are influenced by the location and    
 land use in the main and therefore    
 tend to be based on serving the farms 
 or the canal.                         
 Canal craft is the art of making      
 things for the narrowboats.The        
 materials used are Tin,Galvanised     
 sheet and wood.Normal gloss paint is  
 used to decorate the items made.The   
 products made to_day are replicas of  
 the original canal items such as tin  
 buckets,kettles,pots and pans,fancy   
 painted tillers and deck fittings.It  
 is the occupation of some and a hobby 
 of others.The items are bought both by
 the tourists and boat_people.         
 The other main industry is the repair 
 and building of boats carried out at  
 Foxton Locks Basin.
