		<content>{Birds: }usual plus black-headed gulls,
 3 species of owl, wheatears, both wood
 peckers,   tree-creepers,  nuthatches,
 warblers and  nightingales.  A spotted
 fly-catcher   successfully   reared  a
 brood  in  an  abandoned  black-bird's
 nest in the school-house car-port.    
                                       
                                       
{Animals:}foxes  and  rabbits   abound;
 there  are  badger setts on the ridge.
 The  local schoolmaster reared 3 orph-
 aned  badger  cubs.  He  took them the
 spare  school  milk  and  dinners.  He
 often  had to retrieve the empty bowls
 from a blackthorn clump! They rejected
 steam-baked white bread for wholemeal.
                                       
  From a  choice  of soft grass, barley
 straw  and  wheat  straw,  the badgers
 selected  the  first  two  for  use as
 bedding in their setts.               </content>
