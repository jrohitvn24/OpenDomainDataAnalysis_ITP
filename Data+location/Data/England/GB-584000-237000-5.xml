 A FARMING FAMILY AND TOLD US THAT HE  
 LIKED FARMING,FINDING IT              
 SATISFYING(MOST OF THE TIME).HE LIKES 
 FISHING AND SAID IT WAS GOOD TO FISH  
 SOMETIMES WHEN OTHER PEOPLE HAD TO BE 
 AT WORK. HE EMPLOYS ONE WORKER BUT    
 ENJOYS DRILLING HIS FIRLDS HIMSELF.THE
 FARM IS IN A VALLEY WHERE TWO         
 STREAMS MEET.60 ACRES ARE TOO HILLY &amp; 
 WET TO GROW CROPS SO HE BREEDS COWS   
 FOR CALVES WHICH OTHER FARMERS FATTEN.

 THEM. HE HAS ABOUT 100 ACRES OF WHEAT,
