		<content>      Employment patterns within the   
 block are many and varried.Because of 
 the rural nature of the area many     
 people are employed in{agriculture }  
 and its servicing. But because of     
 rural depopulation, intesification of 
 farming methods and the buying of     
 property by outsiders who probably    
 commute to{Shrewsbury}or other nearby 
 towns, employment prospects for the   
 locals are rather poor.               
                                       
      The small ribbon development at{ 
{Upper Battlefield,}consisting of some 
 18 or so mainly detatched 'between the
 wars' houses, are occupied either by  
 retired people or early middle aged   
 high salary earners who travel some   
 distance to{banks}and{offices.
