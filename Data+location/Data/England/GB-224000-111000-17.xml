		<title>17PENSTOWE MANOR</title>
		<content>  Up to 1000 people can stay in the    
 chalets in the grounds and the Manor  
 can accomodate 20 people.Mrs Thynne   
 was the owner of Penstowe Manor before
 she died in 1960.She did not have any 
 children because her husband was      
 killed in the great war.Mrs Thynnes'  
 nephew came to look at the house but  
 said it was too big for him and sold  
 it.                                   
  Nowadays, many people come to        
 Penstowe for their holidays each year.
 There is a nice swimming pool,which   
 the children of Kilkhampton school are
 allowed to use.There is also a shop   
 and amusements building on the        
 site,and a bar for the holidaymakers  
 and local people
