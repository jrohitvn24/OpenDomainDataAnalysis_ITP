		<title>09Our Local Shop</title>
		<content> 'Checkers' is our local shop and Post 
 Office, run by Mr and Mrs Pearson.    
 Nearly everyone in the village buys   
 things there like newspapers,         
 magazines and comics. I buy my weekly 
 'Beano' comic there. Mr Pearson always
 puts it in a safe place so it is not  
 sold by mistake. They sell sweets,    
 chocolates and icecream as well as    
 groceries, vegetables and fruit. When 
 we went to school camp our bus stopped
 outside and Mr Pearson and Mr Eley    
 loaded all the week's food on it. At  
 the Post Office our parents can buy   
 stamps and postal orders as well as   
 collect weekly allowances and State   
 Pensions. In the summer many          
 holiday-makers pass through on their  
 way to explore Dartmoor and buy       
 postcards at the shop.
