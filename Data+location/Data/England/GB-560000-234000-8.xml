		<title>08EMPLOYMENT IN SAMPFORD</title>
		<content> In Sampford, from our survey, the     
 people are employed in many different 
 kinds of work.  One of the most       
 popular types of work is farming,     
 especially in an area with so many    
 farms. Some people are farmers while  
 others do farming jobs.  Teaching is  
 another popular type of work with the 
 Sampford people.  Sales men and       
 engineers come high on the list of    
 employees.  In most families only one 
 person works.  From our survey it is  
 noticable that many people who live in
 the Sampfords have to travel to go to 
 their work. The farmers were the      
 people who lived within five miles of 
 their work.  Teachers often travel    
 between ten and twenty miles to reach 
 their school.  Other people travelled 
 even further.  However, there are     
 several people who work at home.
