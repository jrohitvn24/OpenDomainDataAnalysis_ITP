		<title>04Origins of Southwick</title>
		<content>{The Canons of St. Mary's Church       
 settled in the hamlet of Southwick,   
 where they had been granted land. The 
 site was secure and the position of   
 the village ideal, being sheltered by 
 Portsdown Hill and the periphery of   
 the Forest of Bere, the chances of    
 being attacked by raiders were        
 therefore remote.                     
 Southwick was mentioned in the        
{Domesday Book lO86.}Common pasture was
 granted to everyone for their animals 
 to graze on and they were permitted to
 use the Forest of Bere to collect     
 firewood. The Priory and the convent  
 were given permission to enclose 6OO  
 acres of land and woodland to use.    
 A number of l8th century documents    
 have revealed that at that time the   
 village comprised of a mill house, a  
 malt house, an outhouse, an orchard   
 and several small houses.             </content>
