		<content> The name Hawkshead denotes Viking     
 occupation. The area became part of   
 the lands of Furness Abbey in the C.  
 XII. when the church dedicated to St. 
 Michael and all angels and also the   
 Old Court House, now a museum, were   
 built. Hawkshead became a flourishing 
 market town with a charter granted by 
 James I. The school founded by        
 Archbishop Sandys in 1585 is famous   
 for its association with Wordsworth   
 who was a pupil while lodging at Ann  
 Tyson's cottage. The church contains  
 interesting Restoration period wall   
 paintings and parish registers dating 
 from 1568. The Baptist chapel at      
 Hawkshead Hill was founded in 1717 and
 the Friends' Meeting House at         
 Colthouse dates from the late C. XVII.
 The whole area has been included in   
 the itinerary of tourists to the Lake 
 District since the 18th Century.      </content>
