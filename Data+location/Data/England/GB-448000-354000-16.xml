		<content> The Domesday Project,what a lot to do 
 Getting a lot of information,         
 Doing some calculation,               
 And finding a friend that is new.{    
{Working with a friend in a different  
{school,                               
{Trying different things that you have 
{not done before.                      
{Getting to know the final score,      
{Hoping that nobody thinks you're a    
{fool!}                                
 In the street with your pen and pencil
 Asking people many a thing.           
 About how much money your job may     
 bring,                                
 Completing charts with a stencil.{    
{When the work is over and done,       
{Did you enjoy it? Are you sure?       
{I did! I don't think it's a bore!     
{It was really such great fun.}
