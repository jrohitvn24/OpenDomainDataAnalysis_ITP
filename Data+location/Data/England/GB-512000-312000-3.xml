		<content> There are two roads going through     
 Langtoft and they are called the      
 village street and the A15 Trunk road.
 We decided to do a survey on these    
 roads to see the amount of traffic    
 that goes through.We did our survey   
 on the main road and we saw a lot of  
 traffic.Each survey took one hour.    
 These are the results for the morning.
 Buses 1,Motor bikes 4,Cars 148,lorries
 27,Vans 32,Bike 5,Tractors 2,and      
 Coaches 2.
