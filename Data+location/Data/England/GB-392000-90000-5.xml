		<content> The{Admiralty}is on a forty-seven acre
 site at{Holton Heath.}At night there  
 are two men on the main gate and in   
 the day time there are two men on the 
 main gate and three men on another    
 gate. Two hundred and five people are 
 employed there.                       
                                       
 They make all their own{rubber}for    
 life rafts and a few other boats and  
 things. They make and use other       
 chemicals to put on the bottom of the 
 boats to stop mussels clinging to the 
 hull. They collect special{sea}       
{water from Weymouth}they can not get  
 the water from Poole because the water
 at Poole is polluted. You would expect
 rubber to bounce but at the Admiralty 
 they can make rubber that does not    
 bounce.
