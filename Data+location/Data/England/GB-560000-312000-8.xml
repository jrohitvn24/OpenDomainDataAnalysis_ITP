		<title>08The New Cut</title>
		<content> In 1952, the drainage measures failed,
 and St.Germans was flooded. Locals    
 still vividly remember the disaster.  
                                       
 To try and prevent a recurrence, a    
 canal was dug - wide and deep - which 
 diverts much of the water drained from
 the fields away from the Great Ouse.  
 (It was this river which had been     
 unable to cope in 1952.)              
                                       
 The NEW CUT runs parallel to the      
 river, and a few km to the east of it.
 It re-joins the Ouse near to the sea, 
 at a large pumping station which lifts
 the New Cut water into the Ouse.      
                                       
 The New Cut does not pass closely to  
 existing villages and has become a    
 popular recreational area, for boating
 and bank-walking.
