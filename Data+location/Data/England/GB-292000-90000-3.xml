		<title>03POLICE/LAW AND ORDER</title>
		<content>  Policemen can be kind and helpful or 
 strict and firm. They can tell you the
 way to certain places but if you are a
 criminal they can be very tough. They 
 wear black uniforms to stand out in   
 day and to be dark if you creep about 
 at night. If they do not want to be   
 seen by day, they stand in the        
 shadows.They make anyone who goes over
 the speed limit in their cars go to   
 court. Policemen also help control the
 traffic.                              
  The policeman's most important job is
 to catch criminals, such as burglars, 
 shoplifters or even murderers.They    
 look for evidence like fingerprints,  
 weapons and tyremarks.You get a       
 policeman if you dial 999 on the      
 telephone.The city's policemen work in
 shifts.
