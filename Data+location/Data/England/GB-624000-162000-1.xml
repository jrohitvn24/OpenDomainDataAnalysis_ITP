		<content> About 60% of the Stourmouth area was  
 formed by the Medieval reclamation of 
 the Wanstum Channel.Today this land is
 arable and controlled grassland,      
 drained and irrigated by a complex of 
 dykes joined to the River Stour.It is 
 more or less uninhabited.Some of the  
 remainder is chalk downland, part of  
 the{Isle of Thanet.}The rest (a low   
 one-time island in the Wantsum)       
 includes the village of{East and West 
{Stourmouth.}The homes of 90% of the   
 population.Land use in entirely arable
 and grazing.With the mechanisation of 
 farming,the workforce contracted, so  
 that very few people live in the      
 district today.Most houses are country
 retreats for retired folk or even     
{weekend cottages.}There is still a    
 sense of community and tradition to   
 found however.Farming is changing with
 the grubbing out of orchards.         </content>
