		<content> The River Wandle is a tributary of the
 Thames and it flows through the       
 Boroughs of Merton and Sutton for part
 of its course.Two tributaries flow    
 from Carshalton Ponds and Waddon Ponds
 then join together at Beddington.It   
 then flows through Merton and joins   
 the Thames at Wandsworth.             
 The original Domesday Book mentions   
 the existance of mills in Merton and  
 Morden;these would have been powered  
 by Wandle water.Modern industry on the
 Willow Lane Estate lies on the east   
 bank of the River.                    
 On the west bank is a National Trust  
 area,Watermeads, which is fenced off  
 and can only be entered Key holders.  
 The river can also be reached through 
 Poulters and Ravensbury Parks. New    
 paths are being made along its course.
 There is provision for fishing as well
 as the normal scenic views.           </content>
