		<title>19NEWICK PLAYGROUND GAMES</title>
		<content> The infants don't play proper games.  
 They play chase and act out television
 programmes.They do alot of pretending.
 The older boys only play football, but
 some of them like joining in with our 
 games (or messing them up!). The girls
 play ordinary skipping and French     
 skipping, for which you need a very   
 long loop of elastic. We play catch   
 and hopscotch, which is marked out on 
 the playground.We also play'52 Bonker'
 (which is also called 'forty-forty' or
 'pom-pom 1-2-3'), where we have to    
 hide and then get back to base without
 the person, who is 'up', catching us. 
 Most of our games involve chasing and 
 catching and have rather strange names
 like 'Nuts, bolts and screws','My red 
 letter', 'Polo', 'Mother may I?' and  
 'Lollipop shop'.
