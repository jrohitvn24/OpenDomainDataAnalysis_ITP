		<content>  The senior teams play doubles in     
league matches. They play doubles in   
cup matches too but there are also     
a couple of singles games.             
  The seniors have a lot of            
competitions at the club - Men's and   
Women's singles, Doubles, Mixed Doubles
and some handicap events. Cups or      
shields are awarded to the winners.    
  The only other other tennis club     
round here is in Penwortham.The        
High Schools round here also have a    
number of courts. Primary Schools do   
not usually have the facilties to      
allow tennis to be played although it  
is possible that the new game of       
Short Tennis may be  introduced.
