		<content> The majority of shops in  {Bruton }   
 are based around the Hight Street,    
 which also includes two pubs, two     
 resturants, a take-away food shop, an 
 art gallery and a number of private   
 houses.  All the shops and houses have
 long gardens, some of them stretching 
 down to the Lower Backway and the     
 river Brue, and others going towards  
 Higher Backway. Bruton has its own    
 Post Office and branch of the National
 Westminster Bank.  There are three    
 hairdressers, a material and craft    
 shop, two electrical shops, as well as
 a clothes shop (incorporating a tea   
 room) and an outfitters.  Bruton is   
 also a centre for antiques and old    
 prints and books.  There is a chemist,
 a dentist and a doctor's surgery, and 
 a library, which opens on a part-time 
 basis.  Many of the shops were        
 originally private houses.            </content>
