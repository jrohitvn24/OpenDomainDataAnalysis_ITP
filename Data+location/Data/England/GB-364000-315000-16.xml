		<content> Few new houses have been built in or  
 around the area of Kynnersley in      
 recent years.Local planning           
 restrictions dictate that there must  
 be a social need for any new housing  
 built.This area is not designated for 
 any significant residential or        
 industrial growth. Permission for     
 developing the derelict farm yard of  
 Crown farm into a small residential   
 estate has been refused by local      
 planners partly on the grounds that   
 there is no main sewer disposal. As   
 houses have to use septic tanks for   
 sewage further development would cause
 greater problems for farmers as the   
 water table in this area is already   
 high. Of the local residences 65% are 
 owner occupied 17.5% local authority  
 15% private landlord/tied cottage and 
 2.5&amp; private landlord.
