		<title>185, Coombe Street.</title>
		<content> Typical of the houses in Bruton is    
 5, Coombe Street, which was built     
 in 1686, on land owned by the Berkeley
 family.  In the 18th century, the land
 ownership passed to the Hoare family. 
 In 1798, the house, together with No. 
 3 and what is now The Tower House, was
 purchased by the Clarke family.  All  
 three properties were to remain in    
 their hands until the death of Miss   
 Jane Clarke in 1940. To the rear of   
 the property is the remains of another
 cottage, with attached stable, that   
 was demolished about 50 years ago. In 
 the early 1950's, No. 5 was rebuilt   
 internally, with the loss of about 10 
 feet to No. 3. A passageway through   
 No. 5 contains some very old beams. In
 1982, No. 5 was named  {Maypole       
{Cottage,}since it and the outbuildings
 to the rear had originally been part  
 of the Maypole Inn, closed in 1798.   </content>
