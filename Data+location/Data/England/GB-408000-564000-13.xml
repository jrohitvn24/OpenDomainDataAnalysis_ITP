		<title>13THE TYNE VALLEY RAILWAY</title>
		<content>  The Tyne Valley Railway which runs   
 through Wylam was the first line to be
 built across Britain. Wylam Station is
 one of the oldest passenger stations  
 in the World and is still in regular  
 use. It was built soon after the      
 opening of the Blaydon-Hexham line in 
 1835. Unfortunately the               
 Stationmaster's house at Wylam is not 
 in use anymore because of an open     
 station system.                       
  On the 9th of June 1781 George       
 Stephenson Wylam's most famous son was
 born in a small cottage half a mile   
 east of the village now owned by The  
 National Trust. He was known to have  
 proved the locomotive to be a         
 practical success for railway traffic 
 and many of his exhibits can be seen  
 at Wylam Railway Museum in the Falcon 
 Centre.
