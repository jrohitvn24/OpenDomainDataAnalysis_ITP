		<content> The presence of coal has led to the   
 development of housing within the     
 village.Residential areas range from a
 planned area of old industrial        
 housing-a model village with small    
 terraced houses fronting narrow roads 
 to new housing estates.These are      
 council estates,NCB estates &amp; private 
 housing consisting of detached &amp; semi-
 detached bungalows &amp; low rise flats.  
 The development tended to be linear,  
 straddling the B6020 &amp; the A617 in    
 particular The Python Hill area       
 consists chiefly of houses built      
 between the wars with new developments
 on the fringes.The development on     
 either side of the B6020 consists of  
 both private &amp; NCB housing (post-war).
