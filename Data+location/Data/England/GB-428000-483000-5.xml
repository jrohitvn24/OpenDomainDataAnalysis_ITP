		<title>05FARMING IN BURNESTON AREA</title>
		<content> Most of the farming in our area is    
 crops such as barley and wheat. Sugar 
 beet and oil-seed rape are also grown,
 while one farmer has planted peas for 
 the first time. There are two dairy   
 farms at Carthorpe, one of which grows
 maize as cattle food. The farm at     
 Theakstone is a stud farm for horses. 
 Mr.Barker at Burneston told us that he
 keeps sheep as well. He sends them to 
 market at Bedale or Northallerton.    
 There is one farm on the very edge of 
 our area on the A1 where they keep    
 pigs in big sheds.
