    The cost for an adult on a bus to  
 go from Hawk Green to Stockport on the
 359 a distance of about 5 miles would 
 be 58p. If a pensioner were to travel 
 somewhere by bus it would only cost   
 them 10p.  It would also cost a child 
 under 16 years 10p. There are 19 bus  
 stops in our area, and the 394 stops  
 at 15 of them.  People can buy Clipper
 cards which enables the passenger to  
 have ten rides for the price of 9     
 and also saves the driver of the bus  
 from collecting the fare. Most of the 
 buses are double decker buses,each one
 holds 75 people sitting and 20 people 
 standing.  A single decker bus holds  
 41 sitting and 22 standing.The        
 alternative to the bus is the train.  
 Trains run less frequently and it     
 costs more to travel on them.They     
 travel far faster than buses.         </content>
