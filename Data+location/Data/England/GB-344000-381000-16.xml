		<title>16A DAY IN THE LIFE OF KAREN</title>
		<content>     Every morning except for Saturdays
 and Sundays I get up at 8.00 in the   
 morning, go downstairs, eat my break- 
 fast, put the dishes in the sink, then
 go to the bathroom, brush my teeth.   
 Once dressed, watch TV AM until 8.25, 
 get my coat and bag then off to school
 knocking for Sandra on the way. At    
 school meet our other friends Sonia,  
 Kelly and Ceon. At 8.55 the bell goes,
 we go into class, then to assembly.   
 Returning to class for the first      
 lesson, at 10.45 the bell goes for    
 play, at 11.00 the next lesson starts.
 Lunch is from 12.00-1.15. After lunch 
 we continue a work theme with a break 
 at 2.30-2.45. Sometimes a story for   
 the last 30 minutes and bell goes at  
 3.45 for home. I walk home from school
 with Sandra, have my dinner, watch TV 
 till 6.30 go out to play, come in     
 at 8.30, then watch TV, and up to bed.</content>
