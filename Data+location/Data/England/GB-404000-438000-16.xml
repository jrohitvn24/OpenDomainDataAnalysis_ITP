		<content>   Our group wanted to find out about  
 what children did in their spare time,
 so we did a survey on {leisure.} We   
 made a grid to tick off the answers to
 our questions.  The most popular      
 pastime was {watching television.}Out 
 of the children we talked to, 67      
 preferred to do this.                 
   However {football}was also popular  
 with the boys.  Another popular sport 
 was{swimming.} There were some unusual
 pastimes such as {fencing, ice-skating
 and {martial arts.} A lot of children 
 liked to{read}in their spare time, or 
 just{play out.    }                   
   We also asked some questions about  
 clubs. Many of those we talked to go  
 to a local club.  They have to pay to 
 go in, and they go about twice a week,
 usually on Tuesdays and Saturdays.  We
 made a{block graph} to show the       
 results of our{survey. }              </content>
