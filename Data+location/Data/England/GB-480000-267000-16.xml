		<content>Sywell is predominately a farming area 
but very few people are actually       
employed in agriculture. There is a    
Garden Centre and just one shop. There 
is a small area of light industry next 
to the airport although many firms have
closed down recently resulting in loss 
of jobs. The remaining industries at   
present include: air display           
organisers, L.P.G. gas and camping     
equipment suppliers, distributors of   
electronic components, agricultural    
machinery engineers, haulage, storage  
and distribution, storage of office    
equipment, furniture etc.,             
manufacturers of rubber-based vehicle  
suspensions, flying instructors, air   
shipping and forwarding agents, and    
an eletronic equipment distribution    
centre. Attached to the airport is an  
agricultural and aerodrome maintenance 
group and a motel with 49 bedrooms.    </content>
