		<title>11A childs home life in Rawdon</title>
		<content>  School ends at 3.30 p.m. and most    
 children are home by 4.00 p.m.Playing 
 outside with friends or watching      
 television are favourite pastimes     
 along with a host of organised        
 activities.Over half the children     
 belong to the scouting movement.Drama 
 and dancing lessons are popular with  
 the girls and sports coaching with the
 boys.Swimming is also very popular.Two
 thirds of the children regularly have 
 friends to tea.Bedtime is age related,
 but most read to themselves before    
 going to sleep.                       
  At the weekend playing out and       
 watching T.V.are equally popular.Few  
 children shop with their parents or go
 to church,but many visit relations or 
 places of interest,with walking in the
 Dales another favourite pursuit.
