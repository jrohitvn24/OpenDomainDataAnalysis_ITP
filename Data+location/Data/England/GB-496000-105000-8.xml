		<content>   There are two large country houses  
 in the village.  One is Walberton     
 House in the centre; recognised as    
 being the "squire's" house it has     
 recently been turned into flats.  Two 
 recent owners are Graham Eyre Q.C. and
 Lord Woolton.                         
   The other house is now Avisford Park
 Hotel a three star hotel very busy    
 with business men and popular for     
 functions such as weddings and        
 dinners.  It has only been a hotel for
 less than ten years, before that it   
 was a boarding school.  Originally it 
 was a large country house in a park   
 much of which is now the hotel golf   
 course.                               
   A few years ago it housed a round of
 the TV international programme "Jeux  
 San Frontieres".
