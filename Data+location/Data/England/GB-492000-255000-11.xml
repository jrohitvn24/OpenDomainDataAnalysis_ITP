 My school is in Harrold. As I live in 
 the neighbouring village of Wymington 
 I come in by coach which arrives at   
 about 8.5O in the morning.            
 Every Monday and Wednesday morning    
 there is band practice and on Fridays 
 it plays in Assembly.On Mondays there 
 is also the String Quartet practice,  
 recorders and orchestra practice. As  
 you can see there is a lot of music   
 being studied and played.             
 The bell rings at 9.OO and we line up 
 and file into our classrooms.  our    
 form teacher takes the register and   
 then we go into assembly. Then we go  
 back to our formroom until the first  
 lesson which is at 9.3O.Lessons last  
 35 minutes each and lessons and       
 classrooms are changed when the bell  
 rings.
