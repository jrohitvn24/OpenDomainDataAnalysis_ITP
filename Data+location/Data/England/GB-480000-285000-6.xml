Stoke Albany is a small village in     
Northamptonshire. It is a very pretty  
village. Lots of wild flowers grow in  
the hedgerows. There are lots of fields
and farms, and quite a few hills in the
fields. Just as you come into Stoke    
Albany there is a fish pond and some   
cattle. The village is on top of a     
small hill by the side of the valley,  
and is built around the crossroads on  
what used to be the main road from     
Market Harborough to Corby, until the  
by-pass was built. Stoke Albany has    
just one pub, The White Horse, owned by
the Manns Brewery. It looks as though  
it was thatched at first but now has a 
corrugated roof. At the centre of the  
village there is an old street lamp    
made by Royce Thompson. By a wall near 
Chapel Lane there is an old water pump.
