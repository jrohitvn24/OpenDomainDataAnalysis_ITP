		<title>14Shouldham-A day at school.3</title>
		<content>  At playtime,during the last few weeks
 the Infants have enjoyed playing with 
 the fallen leaves from the sycamore   
 trees.A whistle is blown at the end of
 play and we have to stand still,then  
 we line up and come in.               
  From end of play to lunch time we do 
 some kind of English. During the week 
 we do spellings,news,dictionary work, 
 story,poetry and reading skills.In    
 news we write home and world news.This
 week many wrote about the Prince and  
 Princess of Wales visiting Australia  
 and America.Someone wrote about an old
 lady who had her 101st birthday in a  
 home at Swaffham and another person   
 wrote about the volcano erupting in   
 Columbia.If we do not finish we have  
 to do it at home and hand it in on    
 Friday. At midday we stop for lunch.  
  Mr. Caley brings our lunch from      
 Marham Airfield School.               </content>
