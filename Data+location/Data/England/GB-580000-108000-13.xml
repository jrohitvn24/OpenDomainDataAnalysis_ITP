		<title>13THE SEA AT HASTINGS</title>
		<content> The sea provides Hastings with much   
 employment. The beach is a place for  
 recreation and is the basis of the    
 tourism industry. There is still a    
 small fishing fleet although only 30  
 families are involved. The fish caught
 include cod, plaice, whiting, macheral
 and dabs. There are many anglers who  
 fish for sport and there are 4 fishing
 clubs in the town. People fish from   
 the beach, the pier and from inshore  
 boats which often fish above wrecks.  
 The beach can suffer badly from       
 polution. Oil from ships often leaves 
 black tar on the shingle and there is 
 a lot of rubbish washed up on the     
 beach. Sometimes treasure trovers     
 search the beach with metal detectors.
