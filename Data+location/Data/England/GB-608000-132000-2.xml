		<title>02Port Lympne. The Gardens.</title>
		<content>    The surrounds to the house were    
 originally planned by Sir Philip      
 Sasson, but were neglected for thirty 
 years until restored by the present   
 owner, Mr.John Aspinall.              
    The classical gardens are          
 remarkable both for their size,       
 (15acres), and for their diversity.   
    There is a striped garden, a       
 chequered garden, and herbaceous      
 borders, all planned with meticulous  
 attention to colour. The terraces are 
 planted with figs and vines, which    
 echo Port Lympne's historical         
 association with the Roman occupation.
 There is a magnificent stone Trojan   
 Staircase, pools, a wishing well and  
 beautiful stone walls.                
    There are several deep springs on  
 the estate so that there has never    
 been a shortage of water.
