		<title>19POLLUTION IN SAND BAY</title>
		<content> Sand Bay is almost a natural dustbin  
 for the rubbish of The Bristol        
 Channel.Over the years whales,        
 dolphins,cows,sheep and many other    
 animals have been left behind by the  
 tide.Added to this has been all the   
 refuse that has found its way into the
 sea either from ship or shore.        
 1985 has seen the problem receive     
 extended coverage on television,local 
 radio and in the newspapers.The       
 appeals from local residents for a    
 "clean up"has brought some action.The 
 efforts of small voluntary groups to  
 clean parts of the beach helped to    
 persuade the council of the urgency.  
 Woodspring Council finally gave       
 Kewstoke Parish Council the help it   
 had requested for years;the beach at  
 Sand Bay now has a more regular clean 
 up.
