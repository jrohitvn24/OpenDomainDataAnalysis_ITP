		<title>06Woodlands Around Wadborough.</title>
		<content> There are three major woodland areas  
 near Wadborough; Narrow Wood, Deerfold
 Wood and Croome Perry Wood. The       
 footpaths that run through Narrow Wood
 and Deerfold Wood and around Croome   
 Perry Wood were very muddy after a    
 rainfall. The footpaths are also      
 rather hard to follow. The three woods
 contain fir and beech trees. There is 
 some tree felling going on in Deerfold
 Wood. The foxes, sqirrels, rabbits and
 partridges that live in the woods do  
 not please the nearby farmers because 
 they eat the farmers products. Callans
 Wood is part of Deerfold Wood. Some of
 the many wild flowers that are growing
 in the woods are: Hedge Mustard       
 Restharrow, Clover, Bluebells,Daisies 
 and Buttercups.
