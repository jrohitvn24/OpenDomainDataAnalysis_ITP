		<title>11A CHILD'S SUNDAY</title>
		<content> MOST FAMILIES{GET UP LATER}ON SUNDAY  
 MORNINGS. IT APPEARS THAT IN THE      
 LYNWORTH AND WHADDON AREA, VERY FEW   
 CHILDREN GO TO{CHURCH}ON SUNDAY       
 MORNING. MORE TIME WOULD BE SPENT     
{READING THE NEWSPAPERS}THAN ON A      
 WEEKDAY MORNING. SOME CHILDREN WOULD  
 GO TO THE{SUNDAY MARKET}HELD AT       
 CHELTENHAM RACECOURSE AND QUITE A FEW 
 WOULD BUY SWEETS FROM THE PAPER SHOP. 
{SUNDAY DINNER}IS STILL A TRADITIONAL  
 EVENT IN THE FAMILY. IT WOULD USUALLY 
 BE A ROAST MEAL RATHER THAN A SNACK   
 LUNCH. MANY FAMILIES WOULD REMAIN     
 INDOORS DURING THE AFTERNOON, PROBABLY
 WATCHING TELEVISION, AND A FEW MAY    
{VISIT RELATIONS}SUCH AS GRANDPARENTS. 
 SOME CHILDREN MAY GO WITH THEIR       
 PARENTS TO THE PUB FOR A DRINK AT     
 LUNCH TIME. EVENINGS ARE SPENT        
 INDOORS, ALSO WATCHING TELEVISION.
