{______________________________        
 It can be seen that in this area      
 around Lartington there are a number  
 of influences in the place names. Many
 come from Old English, but there are{ 
 some personal names and a great many  
 come from the Norse.                  
              {                        
{Personal Names : }These usually       
 describe land owned by somebody, often
 these names have an element which tell
 us something about the type of land. A
 good example of this is Osmonflat     
 which is obviously the flat land owned
 by a Mr. Osmon.
