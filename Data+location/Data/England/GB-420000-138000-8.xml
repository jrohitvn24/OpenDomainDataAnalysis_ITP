		<content> In {Boscombe}there is a cemetery where
 the people from the village are buried
 .There is also a{church}in{Boscombe  }
 dedicated to {St Andrew}.The walls are
 made of flint and plaster.There are   
 some very old graves in the graveyard.
 There is an old part to our village   
 and a new part.The old part of the    
 village is away from the main road    
 down a little lane .Thats where the { 
{church}and old cottages are. The new  
 part of the village consists of some  
 council houses one old cottage where  
 I live ,a cemetery a pub and a fiew   
 more cottages.We have a bus stop      
 opposite the council houses.In the old
 part of the village there is a bridle 
 path leading to one of the two big    
 farms.
