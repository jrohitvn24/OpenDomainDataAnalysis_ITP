		<content>    VILLAGE LIFE BY A NEWCOMER         
 Mr Mills, a retired navigator, moved  
 into Wigmore some eight years ago.  We
 asked him why he had chosen to retire 
 to this area, and how he found living 
 here.  He said: "We lived in London   
 and when I retired we decided to move 
 to the country.  We looked round for a
 house and we found one we liked in    
 Wigmore.  The house is called Abbots  
 Lodge, after where we used to live in 
 Abbots Langley.  We loved the         
 countryside so that made us want to   
 move into the area."                  
 Mr Mills is now an active member of   
 Wigmore Church and is the Church      
 Warden.  He loves walking and now     
 knows the area very well.
