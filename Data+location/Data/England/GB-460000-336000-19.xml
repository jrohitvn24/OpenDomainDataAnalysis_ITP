		<content>    As well as having hens, Mr. Howard 
 has a nursery at{Lees Barn}where he   
 grows various vegetables. His main    
 crops are runner-beans, cabbage,      
 beetroot, turnips, radish and other   
 kinds of vegetables. The crops need   
 quite a lot of attention especially if
 the weather is too hot or too dry or  
 very cold. When it is time to harvest 
 the produce Mr. Howard is very busy   
 getting the vegetables ready to be    
 sold at the market.                   
    Two goats are also kept at the     
 smallholding. They give three and a   
 half pints of milk a day. Soon they   
 will have a kid. Three pigs, a dog and
 three cats also live at Lees Barn.
