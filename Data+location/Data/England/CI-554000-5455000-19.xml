		<title>19St. George's Church.</title>
		<content> The foundation stone of St. George's  
 church was laid on the 29th of        
 September 1876. It was opened for     
 public prayer on July 20th 1880 by    
 Edward Harold Browne the Bishop of    
 Winchester. Before 1937 the church    
 had parrafin lamps, but from 1937     
 onwards it had electric lighting.     
 Reverend John Pepin, Rector of St.    
 Ouen, was the first to arrange a      
 confirmation service at the church.   
 The window high up at the back of the 
 building has a small beautiful stained
 glass window. Mr. C.E. Le Cornu of    
 Vinchelez de Haut Manor suggested a   
 church club in 1913 which was called  
 Penny a Week club; it was to raise    
 more money to complete the building of
 the chancel.
