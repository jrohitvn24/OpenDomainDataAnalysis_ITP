		<title>01Hankelow in Rural Cheshire</title>
		<content> This is a very fertile part of south  
 Cheshire.  The river Weaver cuts      
 through the middle, and the Shropshire
 Union canal, very popular with        
 holiday-makers in the summer, also    
 runs through it.  The land is ideal   
 for keeping both dairy and beef       
 cattle.  There is one intensive pig   
 farm, with some three hundred pigs,   
 which also has a hen battery-house.   
 One of the farms in Hankelow produces 
 a variety of hard cheeses including   
 Cheshire &amp; Cheddar: it employs six    
 people.  There is a small engineering 
 firm making agricultural wires &amp;      
 animal crushes: it employes eleven    
 people.  In the event of a nuclear    
 war, the South Cheshire regional seat 
 of Government will be the nuclear     
 bunker sited in the North-West corner 
 of this area.
