       In Wheathampstead there are lots
 of old and new houses. In the village,
  the houses are very old and small.   
 Where I live the houses are all new.  
 The estate was built in 1971.         
   My house is made of concrete.It has 
 stones on the front of it.The front   
 garden is smaller than the back       
 garden.My garden has a patio in the   
 back.We have a wall and on the top    
 there are some flowers.In the house   
 there is a dining room and it has     
 timbers on the walls.There is a       
 hatch.The bathroom is quite big.The   
 bedrooms are quite big . Two of them  
 are smaller than the others.The       
 kitchen is quite small.My bedroom has 
 a television in it and also a record  
 player as well.There are shelves on   
 the wall. They have all kinds of books
 and lots of other things on them too. </content>
