		<content> This is traditionally an area of mixed
 dairy, sheep, poultry and arable      
 farming. It lies mainly in the flat   
 bottom of a natural valley. The high  
 water table leads to some surface     
 flooding in winter.                   
 The M4 motorway running through the   
 north of the area gives good access to
 London, Swindon and Bristol. Since    
 its opening in 1970 it has attracted  
 modern industries to nearby towns,    
 changing the character of the local   
 communities.                          
 The main populated area is the village
 of Sutton Benger, with approx. 1000   
 people inhabiting some 320 homes. The 
 hamlet of Draycot Cerne with some 30  
 homes depends on the nearby villages  
 for local facilities. The outskirts of
 the village of Kington Langley are in 
 the south-west.
