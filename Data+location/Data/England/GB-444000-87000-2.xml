		<content> There are{fifteen working farms}      
 within the survey area and one       {
{horticultural}nursery. Most of the    
 farms are livestock, keeping mostly   
 dairy and beef cattle with a small    
 number of sheep.The major crop is     
 grass, but a number of the livestock  
 farms also grow some cereal.There is  
 one large arable farm. The market used
 by most farmers is Salisbury.On the   
 Forest Road there are the premises of 
 Watson and Haig,{agricultural         
{engineers,}who repair and supply      
 tractors and other agricultural       
 machinery.Two of the farms in the same
 area are{agricultural contractors}who 
 undertake work on behalf of other     
 farmers. Also nearby at Park Green    
 Farm there is the only licensed       
{slaughterhouse}on the Isle of Wight   
 supplying meat for pets and hides.
