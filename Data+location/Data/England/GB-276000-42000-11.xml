		<title>11Annual Events in Frogmore.</title>
		<content> There are three main events which take
 place in Frogmore every year. One is  
 the{Regatta}when lots of people come  
 to sit along the side of the estuary  
 to watch the fun. Lots of local people
 compete against each other in small   
 boats and there are lots of different 
 races for both adults and children.   
 There are also some novelty races.    
 Another event is the{Jumble in the Sun
 which is a jumble sale held out of    
 doors. The third event is the{Fun Day 
 which is held in Heath's Field. It has
 races, a rounders' match (Sherford    
 against Frogmore) which Frogmore      
 usually win because they have more    
 people, pony rides and stalls selling 
 sweets, bubble gum, hot dogs, crisps  
 and drinks. There is an admission     
 charge of 20 pence for adults,        
 children under 13 get in free.        
                                       </content>
