		<title>06Shepley Bed Push.</title>
		<content> The Shepley Bed Push is an annual     
 event in the village. It was started  
 in 1983 by Dr.L.Orme in order to raise
 funds for the local Hospice charity.  
 It involves teams of ten people, and  
 each team pushing a decorated bed     
 around a course covering twelve miles 
 through the villages of Shepley,Denby 
 Dale, Skelmanthorpe,Shelley and Kirk- 
 burton. While the 'pushing' is going  
 on, a carnival and pig roast is held  
 in a field until the beds return,     
 which can take between 3 and 8 hours. 
 Prizes are given for the best         
 decorated bed (and team) and for      
 collecting the most sponsor money. In 
 it's first year, thirteen beds entered
 and Â£4,000 was raised. This year      
 thirty seven beds entered and Â£10,000 
 was raised. The event has now become  
 one of the local customs.
