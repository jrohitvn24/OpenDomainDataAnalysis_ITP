		<title>17Unemployment - Yardley</title>
		<content>One of the people questioned who was   
unemployed had been so for 11 months   
and found it degrading. She was trained
as a secretary/receptionist but had not
retrained since being made redundant.  
Another person had been redundant for 4
years and was a trained maintenance    
fitter. He had applied for numerous    
jobs, had 9 interviews but was not     
willing to take just any job to be     
employed. They both believe Youth      
Training Schemes are useful, but only  
if they are used to train young people 
for worthwhile jobs, and are not used  
as cheap labour for employers.         
It was felt that Social Service help   
could be improved, being given to areas
of real need and not being spent on    
local and central government.
