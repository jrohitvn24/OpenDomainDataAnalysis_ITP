		<title>17FOLK CUSTOMS.</title>
		<content>Many churches and Sunday schools hold  
processions of witness (Walking Days)  
through the central streets after Whit-
suntide. It is the custom for relatives
and friends of children who walk, to   
give them small amounts of money. The  
young girls often wear long white      
dresses and banners are carried by     
church members.                        
Adlington, Coppull and Chorley have    
annual carnivals with decorated floats,
fancy dress parades and carnival Queens
and Princesses.  Brass bands supply the
music and there are Morris dancing     
competions.                            
Workers about to get married are often 
made to wear fancy costume and slogans 
and are 'imprisoned' for a short period
by their colleagues in a  public place,
causing great amusement to passers by. 
Summer holidays are still called Wakes,
a reminder of the cotton towns holidays</content>
