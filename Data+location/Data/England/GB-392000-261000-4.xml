 beautiful  country house built at the 
 beginning of the{eighteeth century.}It
 was built by{Thomas Vernon}and the    
 date 1701 appears above the front door
 .{The house now belongs to the        
{National Trust}and is open to         
 visitors. The land of Hanbury belonged
 to the Bishop of Worcester at the time
 of the first Domesday Survey. It was  
 bought by the Vernon family in 1631.  
 The present building was started soon 
 after that time. The rooms sre very   
 large and in the house there are many 
 engravings and paintings and a        
 beautiful staircase. There is also    
 some fine furniture. The parkland is  
 now used for grazing cattle and       
 horses.                               
       A nearby public house is called 
 the Vernon Arms.
