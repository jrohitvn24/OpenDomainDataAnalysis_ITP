		<title>01BURTON SALMON INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content>  The area of our survey is based upon 
 the pleasant village of Burton Salmon.
  This part of the West Riding is      
 administered by North Yorkshire County
 Council. It is in the fertile Vale of 
 York and so most of the land is used  
 for arable agriculture.               
       The skyline is dominated by     
 Betteras Hill to the north and the    
 power stations of Ferrybridge, Drax,  
 and Eggborough to the south and       
 east.Power lines cross the area       
 carrying electricity for the National 
 Grid. The railway traffic through the 
 area is mainly trains carrying coal to
 feed the power stations.              
       The main road through the area  
 takes traffic to or from the A1. The  
 A1 road passes through this area for  
 about 1/4 of a mile.
