		<title>03Children's Games</title>
		<content>  The majority of children's games are 
outdoor.Kerby is played by throwing a  
ball against a kerb and then catching  
it for points.Elastics is where two    
children secure a loop of elastic      
around there ankles into which other   
children jump and manouevre.Stokey is a
group form of hide and seek.British    
Bulldog has the objective of getting   
from one end of an alloted space to the
other without being caught.The younger 
children also play communal games such 
as "tick" where one child chases       
another.They clap hands with each other
to the rhythm of nursery rhymes and    
play "hand stands".                    
  These are only a few examples of     
children's games and although they     
seem simple, a great deal of pleasure  
is derived from them.
