		<title>20EXOTIC FRUIT AND VEGETABLES</title>
		<content>Mr.Sudhir Mehta is the assistant       
manager of an exotic fruit and         
vegetable pitch in Birmingham's        
wholesale Horticultural Market.Mr.Mehta
arrives at the market at 5.00 a.m.to   
prepare for the arrival of his first   
customers at 5.30.His day is a busy    
one,phoning import dealers in London,  
Liverpool and Cardiff to arrange for   
truckloads of imported produce to be   
transported to Birmingham.Although his 
pitch specializes in exotic produce,   
they are still dependant on the sale of
local produce from the Vale of Evesham 
for the bulk of their business.However,
there has been a considerable increase 
in demand for exotic produce over the  
past five years,partly due to the      
increasing numbers of holidaymakers    
travelling abroad,and also due to the  
high immigrant population in the city.
