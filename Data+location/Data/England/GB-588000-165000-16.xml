		<content> Really the area is quite a peaceful   
 place in which to live. The problem   
 that concerns the local population is 
 the fact that no policeman now lives  
 in the area surveyed. In an emergency 
 one can dial 999, but this is not the 
 same as having a local Bobby that one 
 can call on. There is some vandalism  
 to bus shelters and windows and many  
 people claim this is more because     
 there are not so many policemen.      
 Occassional breakins and burglaries to
 houses, shops and car repair units    
 have occurred but it is not known if  
 they get caught. Once a policeman     
 would tour the schools to talk to the 
 children but this does not happen now.
 Many of the older inhabitants would   
 like to see the police stop the young 
 teenagers from being so noisey in the 
 streets during the evenings.
