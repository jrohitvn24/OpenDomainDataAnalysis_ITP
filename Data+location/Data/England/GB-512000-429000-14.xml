 Greatfield library is  situated in the
 shopping centre on Greatfield Estate. 
 A class of nine year old children from
 Oldfleet Primary School visited the   
 library.                              
 "The assistant told us that 2,500     
 adults and 1,692 children are library 
 members.Every week nearly 2,000 people
 use the library.There are 20,000 books
 all together.                         
 They showed us how to look after      
 books.Nearly 30 books a week get      
 damaged or lost.They gave us some     
 cards to look up books in the         
 index.The books are books to look at  
 and you can not take them out.        
 Out of 32 children,18 used the library
 about once a week.At the library they 
 have storytime and pictures for the   
 children to colour"
