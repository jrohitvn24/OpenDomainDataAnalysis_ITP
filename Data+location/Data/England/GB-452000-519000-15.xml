		<title>15HEAVY INDUSTRY</title>
		<content> The heavy industries of this region   
 have traditionally been the main      
 employers of labour in Cleveland.The  
 principal companies involved are      
{B.S.C.,I.C.I. and Smiths Dock.}A new  
 industry in recent years has been the 
 oil refining business on the North    
 bank of the{Tees.}Most of the heavy   
 industry lies along the banks of the  
 river.In recent years the area has    
 witnessed the closure of several      
 works,the most important of which has 
 been the large steel complex at Cargo 
 Fleet.As the works have closed land   
 has been freed for re-development and 
 this is a major feature of the area.It
 has also meant land has become        
 available to improve road             
 communication to and from the heavy   
 industry complexes.
