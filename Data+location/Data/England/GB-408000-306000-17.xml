		<content>  A regional division of Concrete Ltd.,
a company formed by two Royal Engineer 
Officers who were jointly responsible  
for the invention and production of    
precast concrete "pill boxes" during   
World War 1. The Lichfield factory was 
opened in 1945 and occupies an area of 
approximately nine acres.              
  It presently employs around 180 men  
and women. These include production    
workers and office staff, estimators,  
draughtsmen and sales staff. The works 
itself has numerous trades such as     
carpenters, fitters, electricians and  
concrete makers.                       
  The company produces specialist      
precast concrete units such as panels  
and staircases etc., but the main      
product is prestressed concrete floor  
and roofing slabs which are now        
manufactured by slideformer type       
machinery.                             </content>
