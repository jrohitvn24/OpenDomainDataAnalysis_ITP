 Dymchurch .It was built during the war
 against Napoleon.On top of the tower  
 is a 24 pdr cannon.Martello 24 was

 New Hall was built in 1574.It was the 
 meeting place for the Lords of the    
 Level and the court-room for Romney   
 Marsh until 1953.There is a tiny cell,
 once used as a prison.Among a collec- 
 tion of bygones is a ship's figure-

 Syn Returns" by Russell Thorndike.    
 The parish church is Norman.It was en-

 the tower replaced.There are about 12 
 weddings in the church a year.There   
 are 3 bells but one is cracked.       </content>
