		<title>19St. Michaels, Catwick</title>
		<content>     {St. Michaels Church,}Catwick is  
 built of cobbles infilled with bricks.
      We looked at the porch, which    
 has two wooden doors to keep the      
 heat in.                              
      The church was given Â£25 to build
 17 new seats for the poor people . The
 rich people sat facing the{pulpit}but 
 the poor people sat at the side.      
      The{organ}was very small. The    
 altar had a white cloth and a blue    
 cloth. Near the{altar}were two graves;
 they were slabs of concrete one was of
 the old Rector. The{font}has an       
 octogonal shaped wooden lid with      
 eagles on top. The oldest grave is 201
 years old; the youngest person buried 
 is 2 months. The{vestry}is at one of  
 the sides where the poor people sit.  
 The{choir stalls}have decorated ends  
 so do the seats where the rich people 
 sat.Sarah Waudby,Sarah Lister{Leven CE</content>
