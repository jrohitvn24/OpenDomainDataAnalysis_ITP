 The school serves the villages of     
 Ducis and Kingston, and is now called 
 the Collingbourne C.E. Primary        
 School.In 1978 the school in Kingston 
 was closed as the number of children  
 on the roll had fallen, and extra     
 classrooms were provided in Ducis to  
 cater for the greater numbers. At the 
 moment there are 99 children on the   
 roll, and they are divided into four  
 classes. Three of these are held in   
 mobile rooms and one in the original  
 building. The headteacher is Mr. G    
 Evans and there are three fulltime    
 assistants and a part-time teacher as 
 well.Most of the children stay in     
 school at midday; of these about      
 thirty have school lunches which come 
 in containers from Castledown School. 
 The other children bring sandwiches.  </content>
