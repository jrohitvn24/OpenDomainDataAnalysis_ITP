		<title>13The Families in our school(1</title>
		<content> We surveged the children in the school
 and asked them what their parents jobs
 were.{Jobs.}As we are in the country  
 there are more farming families than  
 anything else. There are 15 farming   
 families in fact. All the other jobs  
 in our school are done by one or two  
 families only. People travel to jobs  
 in other squares like teaching and the
 Water board, Insureance people and a  
 lorry driver.One lorry driver does    
 work in our squares. Two people mend  
 machines. Only one person does        
 construction work. Although there are 
 quite a lot of pubs in our area only  
 one pub person's child comes to our   
 school.They do catering too.Only one  
 person owns a shop in our area.
