 block lies Lymm Dam &amp; Lymm Rugby Club.
    Lymm Dam plays host to many angling
 competitions throughout the season.   
 These are usually organised by Lymm   
 Angling Club who own the fishing      
 rights to this particular piece of    
 water. Many amateur anglers are seen  
 here reguarly during the season.

 early sixties.Since then the club has 
 grown rapidly and is now one of the   
 top junior clubs in the country. In   
 the coming season(1985/6) the club    
 will be competing in the newly formed 
 league system for the northern clubs.

 with teams entered in local leagues.
