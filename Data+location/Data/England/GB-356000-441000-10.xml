		<content> THe husband rises at 6.30 a.m. to     
 milk. His wife prepares a full cooked 
 breakfast for around 9.00a.m.though   
 children of school age must breakfast 
 earlier to catch the school bus or    
 taxi. Whilst the husband spends the   
 morning mucking out the shippons and  
 feeding calves and hens, his wife may 
 do household chores, go shopping or   
 chauffeur a pre-school child to play  
 group in the village. She must cook   
 the family's main meal for midday,    
 after which she has time for          
 socialising with friends, taking part 
 in local activities, such as the      
 Women's Institute, (one in Chipping,  
 one in Whitechapel), or receiving     
 visits from representatives of proven,
 mineral or medicine suppliers who     
 usually stay for a cup of tea.
