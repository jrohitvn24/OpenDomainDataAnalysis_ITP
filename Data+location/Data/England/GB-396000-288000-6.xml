		<content>  Oldbury Market, situated off         
 Birmingham Street, operates on Tuesday
 and Saturday mornings from 9.30 a.m.  
 to 1 p.m. Established over 50 years   
 ago, it attracts a number of traders  
 who pay from Â£3 to Â£4 rent for each   
 site. Goods being sold include fish,  
 meat, vegetables, soft furnishings,   
 clothing, groceries, haberdashery and 
 hardware. According to stallholders   
 trade is not very good at any of the  
 markets they visit. These include     
 Penkridge, Bilston and Bloxwich.      
 Regulations state that lorries must be
 unloaded before 9.30 a.m. and must not
 be brought back on site before 1 p.m. 
 but the stallholders said that they   
 didn't worry about the rules much.    
 Warehouses, Cash and Carrys and       
 Auctions were their main source of    
 supply.                               
                                       </content>
