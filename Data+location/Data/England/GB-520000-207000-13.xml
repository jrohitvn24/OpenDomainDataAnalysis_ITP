 PARK PLAZA REDEVELOPMENT INQUIRY      
                                       
 The Park Plaza is a Â£55m redevelopment
 with glass canopy, intended for the   
 top of the AlM tunnel.  Inside it will
 have an ice rink, hotel and swimming  
 pool, leisure and activities shops and
 garden centre.  When we did a small   
 local survey of what people wanted    
 they replied 'ice rink, disco, shops  
 and evening entertainment because     
 there is a local need'.  When we wrote
 a musical masque about the Park Plaza 
 for a national competition we found   
 that Stevenage, Welwyn Garden City,   
 St. Albans, and some local traders    
 feared loss of trade which caused an  
 official inquiry to be set up.        </content>
