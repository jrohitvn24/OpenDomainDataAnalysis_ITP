		<title>14THE VILLAGE HALL.</title>
		<content> Before 1968 there used to be a  wooden
 hut and you had to go outside to the  
 toilet in the dark when a dance was   
 on. There used to be a keep fit class 
 and disco and judo. There is tap      
 dancing in there every Tuesday now.At 
 christmas the school have their annual
 party there and also a school concert/
 play.There are parties for weddings   
 etc. Some times there are meetings at 
 the village hall.The new hall was made
 with brick, and concrete blocks.It was
 started in August 5th 1968 and opened 
 March the 21st 1969 with a bingo      
 session.Bricklaying was done by a     
 contractor and the roof too.There was 
 also a lot of voluntary  work by Mr.  
 Maul.It has a car park in front now.  
 The  hall is on the road just at the  
 foot of the hill near chapel lane.
