		<title>19GREEN BELT LAND UNDER THREAT</title>
		<content> The villages of Harmondsworth and     
 Sipson are within London's Green Belt 
 (To stop London expanding any further)
 which has helped to protect them from 
 change. Much of the land is still used
 for farming and even where gravel     
 extraction has taken place, the       
 companies have returned the land to   
 farming after use.                    
                                       
 The biggest influence has been the    
 growth of Heathrow Airport. There has 
 been pressure from deveolpers to build
 hotels, wharehoses and airport        
 offices. The area has for many years  
 been a centre of communications with  
 the Great Western Railway and the M4  
 Motorway attracting many small        
 industries to the areas of West       
 Drayton and Yiewsly. It is hoped that 
 existing legislation and local        
 pressure will preserve the landscape. </content>
