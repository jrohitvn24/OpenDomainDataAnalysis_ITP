		<content> The main feature is the low rolling   
 flat limestone ridge with a Western   
 slope facing the River Clum and a dip 
 slope draining into the River Onny.   
 The scarp is indented and the dip     
 slope has few deep, steepsided valleys
 often wooded cutting into it.  These  
 are used, at valley shoulder level by 
 lines to the valley head, the valleys 
 being too steep and deep to cross.    
 Population is sparse, one hamlet,     
 perhaps 10 farms, a short string of   
 bungalows and occasional cottage      
 There is intensive farming, one farm  
 which had 30 acres of rough land a few
 years ago has no rough grazing now,   
 but 8 acres of woodland, also 140     
 acres of winter barley and 40 acres of
 oats. On steep slopes the full        
 advantge of our wheel drive extra     
 width wheels for tractors, etc. are   
 being used. Friesian/Hereford         </content>
