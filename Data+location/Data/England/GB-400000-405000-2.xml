		<title>02SADDLEWORTH MOORS</title>
		<content> The Pennine moorland in this area is  
 part peat bog, in the north eastern   
 section, and open rough grazing on the
 better-drained areas. There are       
 underground drainage channels across  
 the moor. The lower slopes are fenced 
 and used for sheep pasture above      
 Diggle. South of the A635 road there  
 is more sheep grazing. The moors were 
 used for grouse shooting earlier this 
 century, being owned by the Brooks' up
 to the 1920's. They lived at Upperwood
 House and employed 3 gamekeepers. The 
 Duke of Gloucester used to attend the 
 shoots.The Crowthers now reside there.
 Overlooking Yeoman Hey &amp; Greenfield   
 reservoirs was the Moorcock Inn, where
 William Bradbury &amp; son (Bill o'Jacks) 
 were murdered in 1832 by assailants   
 unknown. They are buried in a corner  
 of Saddleworth Church graveyard. The  
 modern'Moors Murder'took place nearby.</content>
