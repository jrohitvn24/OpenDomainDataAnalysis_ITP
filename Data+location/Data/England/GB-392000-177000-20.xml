		<content> An important area of controversy in   
 Sutton Benger is the siting of a new  
 burial ground. The Parish Council is  
 obliged to provide a site as the      
 current churchyard is nearly full.    
 Three possible sites are being        
 investigated, but public opinion seems
 to be opposed to them all.            
 The main objections are based on the  
 level of the water table; proximity to
 housing; difficulty of road access;   
 and distances from the Church.        
                                       
{Credits}                              
 This project was undertaken by Class 3
 pupils from Sutton Benger School with 
 adult supervision. Headmaster Mr David
 Powell took the photographs; Parent/  
 Governor Mr John Hughes conducted the 
 land cover survey; and W.I. President 
 and parent Mrs Kay Taylor edited the  
 text.                                 </content>
