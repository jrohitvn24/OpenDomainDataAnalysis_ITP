		<title>14WICKLEWOOD PUBLIC HOUSES.</title>
		<content> There were four public houses in      
 Wicklewood of which only one remains. 
 This is the Cherry Tree at the corner 
 of Hackford Road and High Street.     
  The Bricklayers'Arms was in Low      
 Street and is now a private house.    
  The Kimberley Arms was on the corner 
 of Low Street and High Street, and    
 reminds us that much of Wicklewood was
 owned by the Earl of Kimberley of     
 Kimberley Hall. My father's uncle was 
 the landlord, and the brewery was     
 Patterson's of Norwich. The house is  
 about 75 years old.                   
  The Wild Man ,now another private    
 house, stood back some distance from  
 the road at the bottom of High Street.
