		<content> Within our area we have many support  
 industries. Many garages exist which  
 form car sales outlets, repair shops, 
 body refabrication and tyre fitting   
 bays to support the many families     
 which own more than one car.          
 In an area of predominantly light     
 industry an exception is the the large
{Berger paint factory}which employs    
 something in the region of 500 people.
 As a result of many families having   
 large gardens and a substantial       
 amount of leisure time, there are two 
 major garden centres which have in    
 themselves become  minor industrial   
 concerns producing not only plants,   
 trees and shrubs but also garden      
 furniture, patio miscellany,          
 greenhouses, sheds and related        
 literature.
