		<content>    Mr Simmonite was a miner for 51    
 years. In his early days coal tubs    
 were moved by ponies and men called   
 'trammers'. As a boy he could only    
 work mornings and afternoons until the
 age of 16 when he could work three    
 shifts of 7 hours.                    
    During the{General Strike}of 1926  
 he was off work for six months with no
 income but spent his time walking all 
 the local footpaths. The only trouble 
 he caused was to take a turnip from a 
 farmer's field!                       
    Mr Simmonite was a{Scout leader}at 
 the Parish Church from 1940 until     
 1975. There were about 25-30 scouts in
 his troop which won several First Aid 
 competitions in the local district.   
    Mr Simmonite thinks life is better 
 today in some respects but regrets the
 loss of the old community feeling when
 people always helped someone in need. </content>
