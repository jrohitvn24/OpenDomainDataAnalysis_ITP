		<title>10TIN MINING (1)</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
 Wheal Vor tin mine lies to the east of
 Tregonning Hill .In its heyday it was 
 probably the largest and richest tin  
 mine in Cornwall and probably in the  
 whole world.                          
     The actual works consisted of     
 several mines united in a complex     
 which covered four square miles.The   
 area was worked twice ,firstly,in the 
 Eighteenth Century and then again when
 it was reopened by Captain John Gundry
 and his associates .Unfortunately     
 ,they poured so much money into the   
 venture that they became bankrupt.At  
 this stage the Grylls solicitors in   
 Helston saw the low cost of the mines 
 shares and bought the mine.The Gundry 
 family then sued the new firm and for 
 thirty years a bitter law suit took   
 place.                                </content>
