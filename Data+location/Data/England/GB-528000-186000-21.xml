<title>21Closure and demolition of The Royal Northern Hospital</title>
<content>

The hospital moved to Holloway Road in 1888 and received a Royal Charter in 1921. Purpose-built blocks of flats were built for nurses on Tollington Way in the mid-1960s; they were demolished during the 1980s. &lt;br />&lt;br />The hospital was closed due to the reorganization of the N.H.S. facilities in North London. The Royal Northern Hospital facilities were incorporated into the Royal Free Hospital, University College Hospital and the Whittington Hospital.&lt;br />&lt;br />The hospital buildings was demolished in the mid-1990s to make way for residential housing; the demolition was delayed when a body was found.   &lt;br />
