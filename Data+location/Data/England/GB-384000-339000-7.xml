		<content>The oldest estate houses are those     
built around Werburgh Drive.The bridge 
which crosses Longton Brook at         
Bainbridge Road is dated 1959.These    
houses are detached and semi-detached  
with some bungalows.The second estate  
is built around the Ash Green Primary  
School.The school is in extensive      
grounds of playing fields and its      
buildings are on two sites.The number  
on roll stands at 530 with about 25    
staff.There is a nursery class unit for
30 children and the school has its own 
kitchen to provide meals at            
lunchtime.There is a caretakers house  
in the grounds of the school.The third 
area of housing is built around the    
loop of Pacific Road and Constance     
Avenue.Land in the centre of the       
loop,originally designated for a       
school,is now being built on.Here      
again the homes are privately owned.   </content>
