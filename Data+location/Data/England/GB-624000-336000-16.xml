		<content> Entertainment is self-organised with  
 coffee mornings, lunches, parties,    
 concerts, plays, etc., giving three   
 fold benefit, (1) activity during     
 preparation, (2) enjoyment of event   
 and (3) money raised for various      
 projects e.g. re-pointing of Church   
 tower (1983) (Â£42,000), Village Hall  
 (1984) (Â£62,000) and renovation of    
 church bells (1984/85) (Â£18,000) plus 
 money for outside charities. Coffee   
 mornings frequently held in homes,    
 charging 25p. for coffee and scones,  
 stalls and raffles provide variety.   
 Also held are annual fetes and horti  
 shows. Bingo and card evenings are    
 regular features. Concerts, drama,    
 pantomines, etc., with local talent   
 draw audiences from many local        
 villages. Naturally in 1985 tele-     
 vision, videos and computers play a   
 large role in home entertainment.     </content>
