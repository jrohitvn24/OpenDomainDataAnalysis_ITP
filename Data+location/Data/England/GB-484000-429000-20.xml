		<content>  Fishing in Newport is very popular   
 because of all the ponds. Many of the 
 ponds are privately owned and fishing 
 licences are needed to fish the ponds.
 The main fishing season is from       
 February to about August. The fish to 
 be caught are bream, perch, pike and  
 eels. Just two weeks ago, a ten pound 
 pike was caught in one of the ponds.  
  Apart from these larger fish, there  
 is an abundance of smaller fish and   
 water  insects. This good food  supply
 brings coots, grebes, various ducks,  
 swans and geese to the ponds for the  
 enjoyment of the villagers.           
                                       
  This work was compiled by Class 5 of 
 Newport County Primary School, with   
 help from their class teacher Mrs, J. 
 Watt and the head teacher             
 Mrs.E.Walker.
