		<title>09Glassworks in a Castle</title>
		<content>   9 months ago Robert Martin and Ian  
 Yeates started a glassworks in the    
 grounds of Corby Castle.              
   They use their skill to make a range
 of glass ornaments such as paper      
 weights,perfume bottles and vases.    
   They said that the methods they     
 used(using molten glass,blowing irons 
 and hand tools) are similar to those  
 used 6000 years ago.The glass is      
 heated and gathered on a blowing horn.
 It is then shaped by blowing through  
 the tube and swinging and spinning by 
 the blower who sits on his chair to do
 this.He is called "The Gaffer"and he  
 sits in "The Chair."                  
   The furnace which is heated to 1000 
 degrees C.is never allowed to go out. 
 It is a gas fired furnace and it takes
 5 days to heat up and 5 days to cool  
 down.The gas bill is Â£1000 a quarter. 
   They make about 25 items each day.  </content>
