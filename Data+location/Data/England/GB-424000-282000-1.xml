		<title>01Meriden-Heart of England.</title>
		<content> Meriden lies between the cities of    
 Birmingham and Coventry in a very     
 pleasant rural area.                  
                                       
 Tradition has it that the village lies
 at the centre of England, hence the   
 area is often called {The Heart of    
{England.                              
                                       
 The village is surrounded by typical  
 Warwickshire countryside, the area is 
 important for agriculture and there   
 are many farms around the village.    
                                       
 Many footpaths exist in the area, one 
 of which is the Heart of England Way, 
 so walkers and ramblers are a common  
 sight in the area.
