		<title>09ATTITUDES IN BARNOLDSWICK</title>
		<content> We surveyed some of the people in     
Barnoldswick to find out what they     
thought of living in the town.         
  Most of those we asked liked living  
here and the main reasons they gave    
were:-1.The town is small and friendly.
 2.It is surrounded by lovely          
countryside.  3.The shops are within   
walking distance. 4.It is not far to   
the coast. 5. Bigger shopping centres  
are not far away.                      
 Our survey found that a greater       
proportion of older people liked       
living here than did younger           
people.                                
 The reasons for disliking Barnoldswick
were:-1. Not enough for people to do-  
especially youngsters. 2. Not very     
many good shops. 3. It is too small.   
4. The rainy weather.
