		<title>15Housing Around Braydon 1</title>
		<content> The distribution of housing in this   
 section is related to the topography. 
 The low lying land, Braydon, which    
 makes up most of the section consists 
 of mainly farms and scattered cottages
 with one school and one chapel which  
 have been converted into private      
 houses and a large country house which
 has been converted into 33 luxury     
 flats and let to tenants. The majority
 of the housing is on the high ground  
 on the eastern edge of the section    
 with a small hamlet on a rise to the  
 south. The hamlet Greenhill has 31    
 houses strung along one road which    
 goes nowhere else. The other area -   
 Pavenhill and Purton - consists of a  
 development of individually designed  
 houses and bungalows built about 20   
 years ago and several much older      
 houses.
