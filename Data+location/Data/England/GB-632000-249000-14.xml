		<title>14LOCAL HISTORY: EYKE PARISH</title>
		<content>                                       
The name Eyke--Ike, Eike, Yke, Eyek as 
it has been variously spelt though the 
years from an earlier word meaning     
oak. An oak forest originally covered  
much of the parish.  Numerous oaks mark
parish boundaries.                     
                                       
There is no mention of Eyke in the     
Domesday Book, but Staverton, which was
the original manor is recorded as      
having one church.  The site of the    
original wooden Manor House was        
probably near or under the Rookery Farm
Reservoir.
