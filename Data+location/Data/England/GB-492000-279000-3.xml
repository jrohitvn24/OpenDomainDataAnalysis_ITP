		<content>                                       
  Slipton is a very quiet village. Few 
people are to be seen around the       
village. There are no shops and only   
one pub called the 'Samuel Pepys' at   
the road junction in the centre of the 
village. It is a very busy pub with    
three bars and it serves meals and     
snacks. There are two restaurants which
will seat 50 people altogether. About  
ten people work in the pub, three full 
time, the remainder being catering     
students from Tresham College in Corby.
There are four double bedrooms for long
stay residents. It is a free houses    
serving seven different kinds of beer.
