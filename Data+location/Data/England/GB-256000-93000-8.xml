		<title>08THE EXCELSIOR SILVER BAND</title>
		<content> The Okehampton Band was started many  
 years ago. Originally there were two  
 town bands, before they joined to     
 become the Excelsior Band. Today we   
 attend contests competing against     
 lots of other bands. In November 1984 
 we won first prize in the fourth      
 section taking us into the third      
 section, with our rival band,         
 Hatherleigh. We also attend fetes and 
 carnivals, and visit Westward Ho! each
 summer. We don't collect much money   
 but we do entertain. We have about 30 
 members, one man having been in the   
 band over 50 years. Next year we hope 
 to go to Weisseling our twin town in  
 Germany to stay and perform with their
 band.
