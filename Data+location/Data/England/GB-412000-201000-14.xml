		<title>14MR. ALLAN, GAMEKEEPER</title>
		<content>  {Mr. Allan's}duties involve trapping 
 vermin and rearing game birds.   He   
 starts work at 6.3O a.m. and finishes 
 at lO p.m. with an hour for lunch.    
 He chose the job because of its       
 solitary nature and he loves outdoor  
 life.    He traps stoats, weasels and 
 foxes.    During the shooting season  
 there is an organized shoot of game   
 birds each week.   When rearing game  
 birds he puts their eggs in an        
 incubator then when they are          
 hatched returns them to the mother    
 birds.    Mr. Allan is rarely bothered
 with poachers but when he is he       
 contacts the police.   He says that a 
 person should only become a gamekeeper
 if they enjoy outdoor life and working
 on their own.   Also they must be     
 prepared to work 7 days a week.
