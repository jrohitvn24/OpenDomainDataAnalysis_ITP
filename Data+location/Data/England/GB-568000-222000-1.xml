		<title>01  OUR AREA</title>
		<content> The land in our area is mainly        
 agricultural.There are 19 farms,which 
 grow mainly wheat,barley and oil seed 
 rape.Some of the farms have a few     
 animals but their main source of      
 income is from crops for human        
 consumption.There are very few people 
 living in our area so there are no    
 major towns or villages only a small  
 hamlet of about a dozen houses.Many of
 the people that do live here belong to
 the upper social classes,having large 
 houses,often of historical interest   
 with extensive grounds.There is only  
 14 km of road in this area but there  
 are many farm tracks and              
 footpaths.The uncultivated land in the
 area is either used for recreational  
 pass times eg.flying club,racing track
 or is covered with deciduous woodland.
