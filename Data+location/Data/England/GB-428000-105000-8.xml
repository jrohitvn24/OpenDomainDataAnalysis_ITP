		<title>08District Council Structure</title>
		<content> The New Forest Rural District Council 
 is an organisation which deals with   
 the local government of the           
 surrounding area of Lyndhurst.   It is
 concerned with topics like Planning,  
 Health, Housing and Leisure.   They   
 employ 850 people.   Most of these    
 workers do not live locally as the    
 houses are too expensive in this area.
 The structure of the council starts   
 off with the Parish Councils.   In the
 urban areas they are called Town      
 Councils.   There are 14 Councillors, 
 who are elected every 4 years.   They 
 help to improve their surrounding     
 area.   The District Councils are     
 next, of which the New Forest Rural   
 District Council is one.   Their      
 councillors are elected every 4 years 
 and are not paid whereas the officers 
 are paid but are not elected, they    
 help the councillors .                </content>
