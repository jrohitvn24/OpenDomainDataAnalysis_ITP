		<content> The predominant housing area within   
 the block is the Westlands Estate.    
 Formerly named Boycott Farm Estate,   
 its first inhabitants took up         
 residence early in January 1969 and   
 development continued for some nine   
 years until completion. The 1981      
 census population figure for Westlands
 Estate was 3536.                      
 The dwellings themselves are a mixture
 of 2-bedroomed, 3-bedroomed and       
 4-bedroomed houses with bungalow      
 dwellings available for the elderly   
 and some families.  Two low-rise      
 blocks of flats were also built.      
 The estate is built in blocks, the    
 name of each associated with          
 farming,e.g. Ploughman's, Farriers,   
 Crofters. There is no through access  
 for traffic; the estate is bounded by 
 a main traffic thoroughfare.
