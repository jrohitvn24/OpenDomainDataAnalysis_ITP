		<content> I wake up in the morning at 7.58 a.m. 
 and get dressed and go into Mum's and 
 Dad's bedroom. I say, "Good morning", 
 and then I go downstairs. As I open   
 the door my dog Sally jumps with joy. 
 I climb on a chair and open the       
 cupboard door and get Sally's         
 favourite breakfast, sugar puffs. I   
 have sugar puffs as well, and switch  
 the coffee machine off and have the   
 last cup of coffee. I brush my        
 hair, have a wash and clean my teeth, 
 and then I go to school.              
 At school we have Assembly. After that
 Jane and Sarah go to Basket-ball and  
 we play with the Banties. After that  
 Miss Lomas goes to collect Sarah and  
 Jane,and then we have dinner. After   
 dinner we work until home-time.       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
