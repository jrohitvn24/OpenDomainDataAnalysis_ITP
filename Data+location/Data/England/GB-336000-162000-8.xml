		<title>08CHILDREN'S BOOKS</title>
		<content> Children's books are vrey exciting and
 interesting.My favourite books are the
 exciting adventures of the Famous     
 Five.Roald Dahl books are excellent   
 particlarly "The Witches".This is     
 about a little boy who goes on holiday
 with his grandma.One day he goes to   
 train his two mice in the             
 ballroom.Later some ladies from the   
 R.S.P.C.C.come flooding into the      
 room.When all the "nice"ladies have   
 sat down the ballroom doors are       
 chainrd.The boy was stuck behind a    
 screen in a room with all these ladies
 who turn out to be witches seeking to 
 kill every child.After a while the boy
 is turned into a mouse,having been    
 poisoned with the Grand High Witches  
 formula.Eventually the witches try a  
 taste of their own medicine.
