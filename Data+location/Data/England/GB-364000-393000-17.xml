		<title>17Going fishing in Culcheth</title>
		<content> I like going fishing. It's great      
 because you sometimes catch fish and  
 you can even eat some of them. At some
 places you have to put the fish back  
 in once you have caught them. Most of 
 the time you hardly catch anything but
 sometimes you do.                     
    Near Ratciffe House Farm there is a
 wood called Crow Wood.  In Crow Wood  
 there are five or six deep wide ponds,
 but you have to be careful near the   
 edge because some are boggy. There is 
 a stream on the edge of Crow Wood     
 where the only thing you might catch  
 is a minnow or a stickleback.{
