		<title>03SPORTS DAY 1985</title>
		<content>Sports day is a good day and everyone  
is in a race.At our school these are   
the names  of our teams and their      
colours.Aylward is green, Barnardo is  
yellow, Shaftesbury is blue and Keller 
is red.The flat race is a running      
race when you run 50m from the bottom  
end to the top of the field.           
The sack race when you get in a sack   
and bounce up and down to the finish.  
The egg and spoon race is when you     
carry an egg on a spoon up to the      
finish line.The potato race is where   
you have 5 bean bags in a line.You     
have to pick up each one in turn and   
put it in a bucket.After you have put  
them all in the bucket you run to the  
finish line.Points are given to the    
winners and to the second, third and   
fourth places.The team which has got   
the most points wins the shield .
