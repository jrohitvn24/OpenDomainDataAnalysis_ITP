		<title>17Epworth's Holiday Happening.</title>
		<content>    Holiday Happening is an annual     
 event held in Epworth for children    
 over the Summer Holidays.The          
 organizers and helpers stay at houses 
 in the village.                       
    The happening is held over one week
 with a fun day and an outing included.
 The children are divided into groups  
 with a name connected with the holiday
 theme.                                
    Holiday Happening is held in the   
 Wesley School Room and costs around   
 thirty five pence every day.That      
 includes orange and biscuits.Children 
 from the age of 5-12 are eligible to  
 take part and it is a very popular    
 event.                                
    We are lucky in Epworth to have    
 such an event, and I feel sure that   
 the children who do not go do not know
 what they are missing.
