		<title>11Causeway House, Braintree</title>
		<content>{   Causeway House}is the new council  
 offices for Braintree, situated in    
 Bocking End. It was built between July
 1979 and January 1981, when the       
 offices were transfered from the Town 
 Hall. The building was officially     
 opened on April 25th 1981.            
    An old school, Bocking End Charity 
 School, used to be on this site. It   
 had however fallen into disrepair and 
 had not been used for many years. On a
 balcony of the new building they      
 errected the old drain covers which   
 were present on the school building.  
    The new offices have special tiles 
 on the floor, to absorb the noise from
 each room, so each floor is generally 
 as quiet as possible.                 
    The outside doors are alarmed, and 
 there are detectors inside the        
 building which, when switched on after
 office hours, detect movements.       </content>
