		<content>      The Mid-Hants Railway is a       
 preserved steam railway which runs    
 between Alton and Alresford in        
 Hampshire, via Ropley and Medstead.   
      The railway was closed by British
 Rail early in 1973,and was reopened as
 a preserved railway on the 30th April 
 1977. At first it was only operating  
 between Alresford and Ropley. It has  
 operated during the summer months each
 year since. When leaving Alresford the
 line goes through a deep chalk cutting
 which when first constructed caused   
 local fears that a train might be     
 buried by a collapse.                 
      In 1985 the line was completed   
 through to Alton Station, where it    
 connects with British Rail. The       
 building of the extension from        
 Medstead to Alton was the longest     
 single extension ever built by        
 volunteers, and took just one year.   </content>
