		<title>19A walk to Strelley</title>
		<content> On a pleasant summer evening it is    
 very easy to get away from the drab   
 surroundings of our housing estate and
 take a leisurely stroll to the top of 
 the road, and into Strelley Village.  
 The road through the village has no   
 exit so it seems that time has stood  
 still and the village retains much of 
 the character that it must have had   
 over a hundred years ago.In the centre
 of the village is the very pleasant   
 Broad Oak public house,called after   
 the magnificent oak tree behind which 
 it stands,this is of course where our 
 stroll is leading.With our drink and  
 packet of crisps we can sit and admire
 the old cottages and think what it    
 must have been like to have lived here
 years ago working on the estate       
 belonging to the Edge family.
