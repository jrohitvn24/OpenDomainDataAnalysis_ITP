		<title>15Fighting Fit.</title>
		<content> We went on the 3rd July 1985 to survey
 holidaymakers and residents about     
 health and fitness. We found every    
 person said that keeping fit was very 
 important. About 90% said they did    
 stretching and bending exercises but  
 only 50% they ate any health foods.   
 Many of the older people said that    
 they used to play sports when they    
 were younger such as swimming, tennis 
 and football. Some people said "We    
 stopped keeping fit because we got    
 married, had kids and therefore did   
 not have time." Finally, many people  
 believe that it was sensible to keep  
 fit but one should be careful about   
 overdoing it.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
