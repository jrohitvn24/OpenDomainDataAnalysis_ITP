 Northborough is a village (pop.1200)  
 about 7 miles north of Peterborough.  
 The A15 runs past the edge of the     
 village. The village shop, which sells
 everything, contains a post office.   
 There is a church and a primary       
 school. Some houses in Northborough   
 are very old, but in some areas       
 building is still going on. The older 
 houses are usually built of stone and 
 thatch while modern houses are built  
 of brick and tile. There is a         
 community centre, out_side of which   
 there is a grass area with swings, a  
 climbing frame, a BMX track and a     
 football pitch. It is used as the     
 village play_ground. The village has  
 a pub, opposite which is a fortified  
 manor-house. This was once occupied by
 Oliver Cromwell's sister and has been 
 used as a restaurant.                 </content>
