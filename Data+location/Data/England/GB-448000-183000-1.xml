		<content>     ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::      
   This area, on the Oxfordshire/      
Berkshire border, is predominantly     
undulating farming land, both arable   
and pastural, around the main centre   
of population,the village of Chilton.  
The village itself is in the centre    
of a plain just beneath the upper      
chalk scarps of the Berkshire Downs.   
  {Ancient tracks, the Portway and the 
Icknield Way, pass to the north, and   
the Ridgeway crosses the Downs above   
the village to then south.}            
   The main communication route this   
century has been the north-south A34   
trunk road. As the village lies off    
the main route, its narrow roads have  
never been subjected to the vast       
increase in traffic, and it has        
remained a Downland village of         
character.
