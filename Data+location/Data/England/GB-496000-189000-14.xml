The old {tradition} of {lace-making} in
Seer Green is being revived at the     
local school. Jordans has an artist    
{potter} [ceramicist] who works from   
home, exporting to America and Japan,  
also a wall tapestry weaver. Both      
have lived and worked here for over 25 
years. {Professional artists} with     
studios in the village are a landscape 
painter, a portrait painter and a      
commercial freelance artist designer.  
A 90 year old artist, now blind, is    
still selling lithographs of his work, 
including many local sketches.         
The main crafts in Chalfont St. Peter  
are lace making, bobbin turning and    
cane and basket making. There is also  
an artist who does pen and ink drawings
and a bee keeper.
