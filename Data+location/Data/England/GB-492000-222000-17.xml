		<title>17THE CHURCH IN BILLINGTON</title>
		<content> The Anglican church is run by the     
 annually elected Parish Church Council
 and two church wardens who have       
 contact with the vicar at Leighton    
 Buzzard, Reverend Peter Whittaker.    
 They are also responsible for the     
 church fabric and finance including   
 insurance, and fund raising. Money is 
 sent to the St Albans diocese towards 
 administration costs, salaries and    
 training of clergy.  The church is the
 centre of the village, and although   
 few people attend services, the       
 villagers do not want it to close. To 
 try and become more involved in the   
 village life a questionaire has been  
 sent to all households to see how     
 this can be achieved. Two chapels that
 were in Billington have now closed    
 thus it is felt to be the duty of the 
 parishioners to keep the church alive 
 for future generations.               </content>
