  The land is of an undulating nature  
 much affected by agriculture.         
  The main centres of population are   
 the villages of Marston St. Lawrence  
 approx. 200 persons and Greatworth    
 approx. 1000 persons. The armed forces
 built an RAF radio station at         
 Greatworth in 1941 and some of the    
 population of this village is made up 
 of service personnel.                 
  Childrens education is at Greatworth 
 Primary School which serves both      
 communities along with the one village
 shop. The area is visited by a number 
 of mobile traders.                    
  There are two churches in Greatworth,
 St. Peters and the Methodist. Marston 
 is served by the church of St.        
 Lawrence Marston.Each community has a 
 number of thriving clubs which reflect
 the interests of the population.      </content>
