		<title>05THE BUTCHER AT DIGSWELL</title>
		<content> In the main street of Digswell village
 Mr Marsh has a posh, old fashioned    
 butchers shop.  He has run it since   
 1961 with his wife.  He has an antique
 cash till and a collection of old     
 clevers and scales. The meat is       
 supplied from Norfolk.  Chicken and   
 beef are most popular, but he also    
 sells unusual meats like venison.     
 Fillet steak is his his most expensive
 meat. Christmas is the busiest time of
 year and Friday (3.30 - 4.30) and     
 Saturday are the busiest days.  He is 
 closed on Sunday, Monday and          
 Saturday afternoon. He takes Â£2,000   
 per week. He has had 2 burglaries when
 both meat and money were stolen.  He  
 is happy to continue being a butcher  
 here in Digswell until he retires.
