My favourite game is called Ice Cream. 
There is one person who stands in front
of a wall and faces it. The other      
people who are playing have to try and 
touch the wall without "it" seeing     
them. If you are seen you have to stand
with your arms sticking out and your   
feet apart. When two people have been  
seen they have to join hands. When     
everybody has been seen the person at  
the wall has to tell a story. I shall  
give you an example. "I went to the    
shops yesterday and I bought an ICE    
CREAM!". On the words Ice Cream        
everyone has to run to the starting    
line before the person who is "it"     
touches you. If you are touched then   
you are the new "it".
