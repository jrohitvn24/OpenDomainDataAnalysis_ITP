		<title>06ELIZABETH CASTLE,ST.HELIER</title>
		<content>   The castle is a tourist attraction  
 which is floodlit at night. Situated  
 on an islet about half a mile out at  
 sea from St.Helier it can be reached  
 by a causeway which uncovers at low   
 tide or by amphibious vehicle.        
   At the landward end of a breakwater 
 is the Hermitage Rock where, in the   
 6th century, the hermit Helier was    
 beheaded by raiding pirates. St.Helier
 is named after him and the Parish     
 crest is crossed axes in his memory.  
   Queen Elizabeth I ordered the castle
 built, but it was modified by the     
 addition of German gun emplacements   
 and searchlights during World War II. 
 The castle offers splendid views of   
 St.Helier and St.Aubin's Bay and      
 houses a cafe and a museum which      
 depicts its history which includes    
 its siege during the Civil War.
