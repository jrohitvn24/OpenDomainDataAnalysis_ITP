		<content> One of the outstanding features of the
 area is the number of beautiful black 
 and white timbered houses many of them
 thatched and dating from medieval     
 times. Most of them have now been     
 carefully modernised and are mainly   
 lived in by the more wealthy commuters
 who have moved into the area,and can  
 afford the high cost of maintenance of
 these properties. Many of them were   
 formerly farmhouses or tied cottages  
 lived in by agricultural workers,whose
 numbers have now greatly declined so  
 their houses have been sold off by the
 land owners and townspeople buy them  
 eagerly to convert into most desirable
 homes.There is a small modern council 
 estate, including bungalows for the   
 elderly. There are several private    
 developments and some Victorian houses
 all of brick and tile construction.
