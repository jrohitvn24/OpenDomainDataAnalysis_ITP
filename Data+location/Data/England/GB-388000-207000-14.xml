		<title>14An interesting resident.(1)</title>
		<content> One isolated cottage has been occupied
 by a lady who decided,fifty years ago,
 to avoid 'the rat race'.She came      
 originally from Ireland, her father   
 working for a local forestry estate.  
 She decided to stay on in the area    
 after her father died and spent a lot 
 of time visiting old people dying of  
 cancer .The declining rural community 
 had left a lot of elderly living in   
 poor conditions and cancer seemed to  
 be particularly prevalent.She worked  
 at a chemists in Stroud and walked    
 there and back every day.             
{She has a wonderful house.The front   
{room is most unusual with a lot of    
{mirrors,old china,wooden carvings and 
{animal pictures.The chairs are covered
{in a mix of blankets and cushions-and 
{the whole place smells of animals     
{because of all her pets.
