		<title>11A LOCAL CHARACTER</title>
		<content>  In the last century, there lived in  
 Lillington a poor road scraper called 
 William Treen. As he worked around the
 area, he would beg kitchen scraps from
 the farmers wives. Back in his little 
 cottage these turnip tops, cabbage    
 leaves and the like went into his pot 
 to make the thin soup on which he     
 lived. The local people felt very     
 sorry for poor old Billy.             
  When he died, however,a hoard of gold
 was found in the cottage, and local   
 sympathy evaporated. The angry        
 villagers erected a gravestone which  
 still stands. In memory of 'William   
 Treen the miserd',it bears a short    
 verse:                                
    I poorly lived and poorly died,    
    Poorly buried and no one cried.    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
