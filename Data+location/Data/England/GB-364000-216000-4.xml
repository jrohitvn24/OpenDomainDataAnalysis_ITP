		<title>04MITCHELDEAN CHURCH</title>
		<content>     Mitcheldean Church is a large and 
 fine building, built largely of local 
 stone. The nave has a high clerestory 
 roof, and there is a south aisle and  
 two north aisles. There is a chancel, 
 south porch, and a tower with a tall  
 spire at the western end of the south 
 aisle.                                
     The oldest parts of the church are
 the nave, inner north aisle and the   
 tower, which are 14th Century. The    
 outer north aisle and the clerestory  
 were added in 1460, and the chancel   
 was added during restoration work in  
 1853.                                 
     Notable features are the tall     
 nave, the painted panels of the life  
 of Christ, the font, the great marble 
 reredos with its life size figures    
 erected in 1911, and the modern east  
 window of 1968. Recent work has       
 included restoring the weather cock.  </content>
