		<content>{    Shopping in Fernhurst.            
 All the shops in the village are      
 situated close to the village         
 crossroads. Six shop premises  are in 
 Vann Rd. to the west of the crossroads
 in two modern blocks.At the crossroads
 are the Post Office,Newsagent's and   
 several new shop premises which have  
 been part of the recent conversion of 
 the old village grocer's shop.These   
 are vacant at present but are expected
 to open for business in late          
 Autumn.There are two antique shops on 
 the main road near the village centre 
 and a furniture restorer occupies     
 premises near the village hall.People 
 regularly travel to Haslemere to shop 
 at the large supermarkets in the town 
 whilst Chichester,Farnham and         
 Guildford offer greater facilities for
 shopping within easy reach of         
 Fernhurst.                            </content>
