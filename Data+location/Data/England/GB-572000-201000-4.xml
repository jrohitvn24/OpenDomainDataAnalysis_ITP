		<title>04THE KENNELS SANDON</title>
		<content>   The owners of the kennels breed     
 labradors for their own pleasure.They 
 first started in 1956.                
   At the moment there are eight dogs. 
 They eat fish, tripe, tinned          
 meat,biscuit,raw cabbage and raw egg  
 occasionally. They also have a bowl of
 milk at 10 o'clock.                   
   The lady feeds the dogs and the man 
 takes them out every day for          
 exercise for one hour. They are also  
 let out into the field each day.      
   The bitches are pregnant for        
 63 days.The puppies open their eyes at
 ten to fourteen days. The more        
 contented the puppy the longer it     
 takes to open its eyes.               
   The bitches have their puppies      
 indoors and then rest before they go  
 out. There is central heating in the  
 kennels.
