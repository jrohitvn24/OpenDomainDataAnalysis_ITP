		<title>11Footpaths: a local walk.</title>
		<content> There are many local footpaths which  
 provide interesting, easy rural walks.
 Mostly these are over meadows and can 
 be muddy but tracks used by farmers   
 are usually rough and stony. The main 
 attractions are: fresh air, excellent 
 views and an abundance of wildlife.   
 A typical walk in the area starts at  
 Barrowby church, crosses a stile and  
 continues West for about two and a    
 half miles. There are good views      
 across the Trent Valley to the Lincoln
 Edge.Soon after Breeder Hills Farm,   
 turn North and continue along the     
 Viking Way. Cross the A.52 and        
 continue to the level crossing,       
 turn East alongside the railway to    
 Sedgebrook (old church and abbey      
 house). Return to Barrowby via A.52   
 and footpath by Blacklands Barn.      
 Before reaching Barrowby Old Hall note
 medieval ploughing patterns.          </content>
