		<title>20Saint Etheldreda's Church</title>
		<content>Records dated 1504 show that Guilsboro'
church was formerly dedicated to Saint 
Wilfred.No record exists of it's re-   
dedication to its' present name.The    
tower was built in the 13th century and
is of sandstone,as is the nave,the     
north and south aisles,the chancel and 
the north and south porches.The lime-  
stone spire is dated 1618 but that is  
probably a repair date.The first vicar 
was Richard de Standon in 1225,the     
present one is Rev.William Gibbs,who   
took office in 1968.                   
In the aisles,above the piers,are seven
grotesque heads.On the roof beams is a 
series of seven carved wooden heads    
reputed to portray Shakespear's Seven  
Ages of Man.Above the tower arch are   
the Royal coat of arms in painted wood.
There are 9 stained glass windows and  
several marble memorial plaques on the 
walls,there are 6 bells in the tower.  </content>
