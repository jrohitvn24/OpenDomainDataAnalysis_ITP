There were 4-5 of us producing SNOOZE. I still have some of the originals. Editorial meets were held in St Andrews church/hall on Cartland Road. A lady called Trish was the editor, if I recall correctly. I was 15 at the time and, together with a schoolfriend, we were responsible for the back page - which was the fun tidbit section of jokes, riddles, droodles and whatever other bits of trivia we could find to put on there. Of course, we also did the occasional serious article! Such as counting the number of Indian, Chinese and other eateries that prevailed on the high street (and still do) and writing up the stats. And what happened next? I went on to become a journalist â€“ all thanks to this little local zine.   &lt;br />
