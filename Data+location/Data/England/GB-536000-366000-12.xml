		<title>12The Hundleby Post Office.</title>
		<content>     Mrs.M. has been postmistress of   
 the Hundleby Post Office for the last 
 l8 months. She told us how the post   
 office had origonally been two semi_  
 detatched houses over l50 years old.  
 Then the dividing wall had been       
 knocked down to make a space large    
 enough for an office.                 
     Like most village post offices    
 this is also a general store and sells
 everything from baby's dummies to     
 washing_up bowls.                     
     Apart from selling stamps and     
 mailing parcels, the office           
 distributes senior citizen's pensions 
 and funds for handicapped persons.    
     Mr.M. does not work in the post   
 office very much. He spends most of   
 his time as a handyman around the     
 village.                              
                                       
                                       </content>
