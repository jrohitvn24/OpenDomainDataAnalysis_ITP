		<title>09Cank Thorn</title>
		<content>    Opposite the Commonwealth War      
Cemetery we found a tree called Cank   
Thorn, planted on the site of the      
original tree which marks the meeting  
place of three ancient manors.         
    It is referred to in the records   
of "beating the bounds" of Berkswich   
Parish in the 18th century.            
    The tree grew until 1971 when it   
was broken off, but a sucker survived. 
    The mysterious thing is that this  
tree is not found growing wild anywhere
in the world. It is a hybrid of a tree 
introduced from N.America in 1656, so  
perhaps Cank Thorn may have been the   
first of its kind.                     
   It is a bushy tree about 3m tall.   
The dark green glossy leaves are broad 
with toothed edges. The 2cm long thorns
are brownish purple. The creamy white  
flowers are followed by red berries in 
autumn.                                </content>
