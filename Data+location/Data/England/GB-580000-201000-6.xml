		<content> A lady says along time ago some men   
 were putting up pylons in a field.    
 One man fell from the top of the      
 pylon and was killed.                 
 The lady's husband thought he saw the 
 same man walking across the field.    
                                       
    Once a month the lady from Hill    
 Farm goes down stairs to find the down
 stairs lights on when she knows the   
 night before she turned them off.     
                                       
    At White Elm Farm a man committed  
 suicide, so, as they always did in    
 those days they drove a stake through 
 his heart. They buried him and later a
 white elm tree grew on the same       
 spot.They say he still comes up from  
 under the tree and haunts the area.   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
