		<content>      The land in the 3x4 block rises  
 from 189 feet above sea level at the  
 S.W. corner _ Fulling Bridge _ to 315 
 feet above sea level along the East   
 Town Rd.                              
      The whole area is open and wind- 
 swept.It lies on a corallian ridge    
 that is exposed along the northern    
 edge of the block as a small disused  
 quarry face - very rich in marine     
 fossils.                              
      Overlying the corallian ridge is 
 a layer of clay, exposed at the       
 southern end of the block by the      
 quarry workings of the Blue Circle    
 Cement Group. Covering the clay is    
 greensand making a fertile loamy      
 soil.                                 
      The area is watered with numerous
 springs, and the lower lying land is  
 crossed by several small streams which
 tend to make it waterlogged.          </content>
