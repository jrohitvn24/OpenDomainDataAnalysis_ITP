		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO THE AREA</title>
		<content>The area includes three small          
villages, Chiselhampton, Toot Baldon   
and Marsh Baldon. The older houses are 
stone built and some still retain      
thatched roofs. More modern ones are   
brick (some rendered) and tiles. Most  
of the land is agricultural, some      
privately owned and some rented. Much  
of the area is owned by Queens College 
Oxford. As their properties become     
vacant they are being soldoff. The     
number of farm labourers has fallen    
and their homes are being bought and   
renovated by people working in nearby  
towns, Oxford and Abingdon. Some house 
holders commute daily to London by car 
(M40) or by train (Didcot). Some       
houses are only used at weekends. The  
number of children at the local school 
is low. There are no shops and no      
regular public transport so house-     
holders need a car.                    </content>
