		<title>04THE POST OFFICE,HASELOR WARK</title>
		<content>      We went to Mrs. Ryman to ask her 
 about the Post Office. She told us    
 that the building was about 400 years 
 old. The only change that she could   
 think of concerning the house was that
 it was once thatched and now it has a 
 tin roof. The shop took up one small  
 part of her house. It was a little    
 difficult for customers when more than
 two called at once because there was  
 no room for more than two at a time.  
 She sold about 100 stamps a week but  
 she also sold sweets, chocolates,     
 cards, cigarettes and other small     
 items. Her best selling item was the  
 cigarettes but she sold crisps and    
 sweets to the children. She remembers 
 being burgled twice.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
