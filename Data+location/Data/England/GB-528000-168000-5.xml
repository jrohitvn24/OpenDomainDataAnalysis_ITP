 In Trumble Gardens there used to be   
 some big houses but these were        
 destroyed in The Second World War.    
                                       
 It is said that Dick Turpin once lived
 in Thornton Heath in a little cottage 
 where Thornton Heath presently stands.
 The railways in Thornton Heath vastly 
 affected the area and the population  
 grew very large.Thornton Heath is the 
 most densly populated in the Croydon  
 Borough.                              
                                       
 Many other things are changing as     
 well;small shops are being replaced by
 supermarkets;big old houses are being 
 demolished to build new flats.The     
 whole face of Thornton Heath has      
 changed over the years and will carry 
 on changing.
