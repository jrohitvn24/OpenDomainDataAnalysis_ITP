		<title>12THE ELDERLY IN CHESTERTON</title>
		<content> Elm Grove is a private residential    
 home for the care of the elderly 1.3km
 SE of Cirencester.It has been extended
 until it now has 27 bedrooms.These are
 fitted with an intercom system so that
 in cases of emergancy the residents   
 can be in instant touch with the State
 Registered nursing and other members  
 of the home's 40 staff.Lifts,baths and
 toilets are designed for use by those 
 residents who are wheel-chair bound.  
 There are hand rails to aid movement  
 in all the corridors and the building 
 is kept very warm as the elderly feel 
 the cold.There are communal rooms such
 as a T.V room,Laundrette and Dining   
 Hall as well as the resident's own bed
 sitting rooms.Occupational therepists 
 from the local hospital give treatment
 and arrange outings for the residents.
 As many people retire to this area Elm
 Grove will soon need to be extended.  </content>
