 educational establishments serving not
 only the local children but alos those
 from abroad. There are nursery        
 schools, primary and secondary schools
 as well as the American International 
 University. Two of the secondary      
 schools occupy buildings put up during
 the 19th Century, Grange Park         
 Comprehensive School for Boys is in   
 the former Junior Masonic School for  
 Boys and part of Queen's Comprehensive
 school uses the Royal Caledonian      
 Schools buildings. The primary schools
 have been built mainly since World War
 2 to serve the post war housing       
 developments associated with the new  
 Trading Estates. They all have        
 extensive grounds and facilities.     
 Because of falling school rolls Grange
 Park school is due to close at the end
 of the summer term 1985.              </content>
