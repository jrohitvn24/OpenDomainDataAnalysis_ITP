		<title>18LEISURE;  THE SALPERTON AREA</title>
		<content> This is an area of country pursuits   
 . The village shows at once there are 
 keen gardeners.There are footpaths    
 but most walkers are local.Hunting is 
 popular,the"box"lies in some of the   
 best Cotswold Hunt country;there are  
 followers on horseback,on foot and in 
 cars. There is a considerable amount  
 of shooting too,both rough shooting on
 the farms and more organised.Several  
 thousand pheasants and partridges are 
 raised in the area. Part of the land  
 is shot over by a syndicate shooting  
 as many as 3O days between Oct l and  
 Jan 31.This seems almost a leisure    
 industry rather than a pastime, with  
 half a dozen or more guns who may be  
 paying several hundred pounds for a   
 day's sport. Shooting means the wood  
 land is cared for and replanted,but   
 there is wide use of snares and traps.
