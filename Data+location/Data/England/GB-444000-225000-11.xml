		<content> Old stone cottages predominate with   
 private and council modern housing in 
 the village of Steeple Aston. There   
 are also some old people's bungalows. 
 Most people travel outside the area   
 for work. Others are self employed and
 include authors, a carpenter,         
 electrician, gardener, hairdresser.   
 There is no railway in the area but   
 Steeple Aston residents use nearby    
 Heyford Station for travelling to work
 in Oxford, Banbury or London. (There  
 are direct trains to Paddington.)     
 Limited local bus services are        
 available.                            
 Gas has recently been brought to the  
 area and serves some homes.           
 Electricity is generally available.
