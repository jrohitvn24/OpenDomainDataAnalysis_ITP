		<content> The Brampton Golf Club entrance is    
 almost opposite the entrance to Talkin
 Tarn.                                 
 The course has eighteen holes and     
 covers an area of about 100 acres.    
 Membership is in the region of a      
 hundred and sixty with a committee of 
 fourteen. Sixty to seventy visitors   
 can be expected to play there in a    
 busy week.                            
 A professional and his assistant are  
 available. Every week, the            
 professional and the club captain take
 on two different players. A new club  
 house is nearing completion.          
 An indoor bowling club meets regularly
 during the winter months in Milton    
 Village Hall. They take part in       
 matches with other local bowling      
 clubs.
