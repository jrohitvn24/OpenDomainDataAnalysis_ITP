		<content> There is only one church in our area  
 now. That is the Anglican Church at   
 Alwinton.It is part of the parish of  
 Alwinton with Holystone, and the      
 Vicar,residing in the Vicarage at     
 Alwinton, is also priest at Alnham    
 Church.                               
   The United Reform Church closed in  
 1981. It had previously been a        
 Presbyterian Church in the Scottish   
 tradition, and had been in the        
 existing church building since        
 1854.Members now worship in their     
 churh at Thropton.                    
   There is a Roman Catholic chapel at 
 Biddlestone,but it is not now         
 used.Their nearest church is at       
 Thropton.                             
   There is also a Plymouth Bretheren  
 Meeting Room in Thropton.
