		<title>18A SURVEY OF 1ST YEAR PUPILS</title>
		<content>                                       
 A survey was conducted among first    
 year pupils at Hassenbrook            
 Comprehensive School. Most pupils     
 enjoyed the lessons. Movement between 
 classrooms was popular. Only a few    
 pupils disliked this. A majority of   
 pupils liked the work they did at     
 school and a few said they would like 
 more. Many children thought the       
 buildings were large and they did get 
 lost a lot in the first weeks at their
 new school. The large size of the     
 playground was seen as a good thing   
 but the number of seats available was 
 too small.
