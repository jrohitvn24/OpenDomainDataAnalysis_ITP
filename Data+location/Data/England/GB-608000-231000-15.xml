		<title>15Swans at Mistley</title>
		<content> The swans are situated along the Walls
 by the Quay. They are mainly Mute     
 swans which are white but there is    
 occasionally an odd black swan who    
 comes from down the river. The swans  
 have declined over the years because  
 of the pollution in the river and     
 because some of the Maltings have     
 closed down, so the swans cannot live 
 off the grain which was deposited into
 the river.                            
 Swan Rescue, a volunteer organisation 
 takes care of the swans.
