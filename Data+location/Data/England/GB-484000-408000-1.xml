		<title>01Scunthorpe. Overview.</title>
		<content> Our Domesday block stretches from the 
 River Trent in the West, to the top   
 edge of the escarpment leading into   
 the Borough of Scunthorpe, in the     
 East.                                 
 The Western edge is bordered by the   
 villages of Gunness and Burringham.   
 Travelling East, you pass through     
 rich, flat farmland.                  
 This is almost bisected by the M181   
 which joins the area to the           
 national Motorway network.            
 The eastern edge is bordered by       
 steadily expanding, modern estates.   
 Keadby Bridge and the 4km stretch of  
 railway running West to East, were,   
 historically, of major importance in  
 the development of Scunthorpe as an   
 industrial town.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
