		<content> If the sun is shining and there is not
 too much wind,I get up quite early,   
 (7-30) In order to start the day's    
 baking.Sometimes in the middle of     
 summer,there can be about 500 visitors
 who come from the other neighbouring  
 Islands.I put the "Aga" on high and   
 start making chocolate sponges and    
 barmbrack.As soon as the "Aga" is hot 
 enough the scones and lastly the bread
 rolls are cooked.I open at 10-30 every
 morning,and close at 5-00.Throughout  
 the day people are coming in for      
 morning coffees and cakes,then from   
 12-2 I serve lunches.After 2pm ,nearly
 everyone wants a cream tea.Gradually  
 by about 4-30 they are all making     
 their way back home.Then I have to    
 start all over again for another      
 day.Then it is tea-time for the       
 family.After that I play the piano or 
 read.                                 </content>
