		<content> There are three priests in the        
 Bellingham area.One of the priests    
 actually covers 800 square miles,from 
 the Cheviot Hills down to about       
 Cumbria.They visit the sick weekly,the
 infirm monthly,and the ordinary twice 
 a year.At a service they get a regular
 basis of about 50 people.The priests  
 think that the Bellingham area is more
 real than anywhere else in            
 Northumberland,as there are more      
 people involved in looking after each 
 other.The priests are launching a new 
{Good Neighbours}scheme,they are not   
 very optimistic,but are sure it will  
 fill a small need.People will be asked
 to keep an eye on elderly neighbours, 
 to ensure that they are always cared  
 for.
