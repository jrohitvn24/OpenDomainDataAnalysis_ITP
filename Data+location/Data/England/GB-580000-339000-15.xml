		<title>15BURNHAM MARKET VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content>    The village hall is the centre for 
 many activities in Burnham market. It 
 is owned by the Charity Commissioners 
 and is run by a management committee. 
 The hall was built with money from    
 grants and local fund-raising and was 
 opened in 1963. It is currently       
 undergoing extensive restoration and  
 redecoration.                         
    Regular users of the village hall  
 include the Youth Club, the two local 
 branches of the Women's Institute     
 (Burnham Market Afternoon WI and the  
 Seven Burnhams WI) and the Royal      
 British Legion. It is available for   
 private hire and is often used for    
 discotheques and private parties. Yoga
 classes take place in the hall weekly,
 and the Autumn Horticultural Show is  
 held there in November. At election   
 times the hall becomes the village    
 polling station.                      </content>
