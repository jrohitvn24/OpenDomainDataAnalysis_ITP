		<title>13SILK SCREEN PRINTING</title>
		<content> The David Evans silk screen printers  
 in Crayford is a famous factory       
 founded in 1825.  The silk that the   
 factory uses comes from China where   
 they breed silk worms to produce the  
 raw silk.  Originally, the silk       
 printing was done using blocks but now
 it is done using screen printing.  The
 factory can cover over two hundred    
 metres of silk a day using this       
 method.  The factory has its own      
 studio for designing patterns, but    
 most of them are from the original    
 printing blocks.  The factory employs 
 130 workers.  70% of their silk is    
 exported and most of it goes to the   
 U.S.A.  The firm also supplies such   
 famous names as Harrods, Liberty and  
 Jacqumar.  They have a mill shop on   
 site which can be visited.
