		<title>12 Wideopen Middle School</title>
		<content>The Middle School opened in 1969.      
Mr. Wilks,head for 13 yrs to 1982,     
taught R.E. &amp; Maths &amp; was interested in
sport,especially football.He enjoyed   
every minute he was here but would not 
like to come back now.A parent said the
Wideopen M.S.,built as a Secondary     
Modern, took 2 yrs to complete on the  
site of a rubbish tip.Each class had a 
small garden.Swim.Baths were built     
later.Mrs Walters who taught Remedial  
Eng.and French until 1982,thought the  
school was quieter now with better     
displays. Assemblies were also         
different.She remembered a girl was    
decapitated while playing on the       
trains on the mineral line,now closed. 
Dinners.There are 14 cooks who workfrom
7.50 to 3.30 to prepare,serve and clear
up the dinners,and 6 dinner nannies    
who change duties daily.They enjoy the 
work because the children are friendly.</content>
