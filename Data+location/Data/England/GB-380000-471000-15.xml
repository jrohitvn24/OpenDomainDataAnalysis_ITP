		<content>{1 At weddings,}village children tie up
 the lych gates.  Bride &amp; Groom cannot 
 leave the churchyard until handfuls of
 coins are thrown to waiting children. 
                                       
{2 Farmers &amp; Householders}have always  
 had turbary (peat) rights on the moor.
  This right, providing fuel, was once 
 a valuable one, and one family still  
 takes advantage of this ancient law.  
                                       
{3 Sheep Gaits,} grazing rights on the 
 open fells, are allotted each year by 
 an unusual method.  Farmers sit around
 a table and pass a slate round on     
 which each writes his bid.  When the  
 slate has passed round three times    
 without a higher bid the land is let. 
                                       
{4 Luck Money} is handed over by the   
 buyer, when a farmer has bought       
 livestock at auction.                 </content>
