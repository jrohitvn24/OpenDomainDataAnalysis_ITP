		<title>20Gala Day at Fletchertown.</title>
		<content> Nearly every year at Fletchertown we  
 have a Gala Sports Day on the         
 recreation ground,opposite our        
 school.These are some of the races we 
 take part in;a sack race,when you have
 to get into a sack and hop to the     
 finishing line:an egg and spoon race, 
 when you put an egg(usually wooden or 
 pot)onto a spoon and holding it in one
 hand,(with the other behind your back)
 you race to the finishing line,trying 
 not to drop the egg!If you come first 
 you get 75p and for second place you  
 get 50p. There are races for children 
 and grown-ups. When all the races are 
 finished we have a sandwich,a packet  
 of crisps,a chocolate biscuit and a   
 drink of pop.In the evening a disco is
 held in the youth club hut for all the
 children. The event is organised by   
 parents in the village. We usually    
 have a great afternoon.               </content>
