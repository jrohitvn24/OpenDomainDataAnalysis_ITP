		<content>     Most schools operate for about 7  
 hours per day; usually from 9 a.m. to 
 4 p.m. (3.30 p.m. in the case of      
 primary schools).                     
     Religious assembly is still       
 compulsory by Act of Parliament and   
 this usually starts off the day.      
 Assembly is also found to be very     
 useful for dealing with administration
 such as time_table changes.           
     The day is then divided up into 7 
 or 8 periods by decision of the Head  
 Master and teaching staff. There is   
 usually a morning and afternoon break 
 of l5 minutes and a lunch break of    
 just over an hour.                    
     Many schools still insist on a    
 school uniform as this is seen as     
 blurring the difference between rich  
 and poor.                             
     The school year is divided into 3 
 terms with a 6 week summer holiday.   </content>
