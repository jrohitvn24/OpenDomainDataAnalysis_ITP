		<title>11HOLIDAYS IN DUFTON</title>
		<content> I've been coming to Dufton for at     
 least part of my holidays for 21      
 years,ever since my university room-  
 mate introduced me to the village in  
 our first year.My children have come  
 with me ever since each one was born: 
 friends have joined us from time to   
 time &amp; few have failed to return.     
 We come for the open lonely fells, for
 the sharply rising mountainsides, for 
 the unexpected gurgling streams froth-
 ing on their way to the valley bottom 
 &amp; the stately river Eden. We come for 
 the familiar friendly faces,curious   
 but respecting our differing life-    
 styles.We all enjoy &amp; treasure the    
 days we share. Dufton is so different 
 from where we live -with the hustle &amp; 
 bustle of the city &amp; our working lives
 -but a small part of us stays         
 gloriously unrestrainedly on holiday  
 in Dufton.                            </content>
