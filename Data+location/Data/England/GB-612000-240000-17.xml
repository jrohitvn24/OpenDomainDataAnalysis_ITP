		<content>The only quiet times are the first two 
weeks in January and the first two     
weeks in August.  Apart from that      
business is very steady, really.  We do
not have many children staying -only a 
few at week-ends, and, of course, more 
at Christmas.

Note:  Belstead Brook Hotel is a       
privately owned establishment and is   
one of two hotels in the area. The     
other is owned by Trust House Forte,   
a national chain of hotels. Belstead   
Brook is a small tributary of the River
Orwell. Belstead is a nucleated        
settlement, which has become a         
dormitory village for Ipswich and now  
has no shop, public house or primary   
school. Its name has been adopted by   
Lord Belstead, former Under-Secretary  
of State for Education.  Ed.
