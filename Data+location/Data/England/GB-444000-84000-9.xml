		<title>09"Bowcombe"-Farming Changes 2</title>
		<content>   Like other farmers; Bowcombe's      
 farmers have mixed feelings towards   
 the{European Economic Community. On   
{balance they feel that it has been    
{advantageous in opening up new        
{markets, though they resent the quota 
{restrictions and extra paperwork.}    
   Another trend in farming; that of   
 removing hedges and trees to give     
 larger fields: a system brought about 
 by the demands of modern machinery and
 the drive to bring more land into use,
 has in some areas altered the         
 appearance of the countryside,and     
 again brought the farmers into        
 conflict with conservationists,       
 ecologists and country-lovers         
 generally. In Bowcombe, farmers are   
 opposed to this trend and feel that   
 the losses in terms of shelter,       
 wildlife, and the appearance of the   
 countryside are not worth the gain.   </content>
