 In our area we have four First Schools
 which feed the Stokenchurch Middle    
 School. Three of these are small      
 village schools,Radnage,Ibstone and   
 ours, {Mary Towerton,}and the other is
 at Stokenchurch.                      
      Until 1984 the children were     
 moved on at the age of 9 years, but   
 this year we leave at 8 years old.    
      The Middle School caters for 8_12
 year olds. At the age of 12 we are    
 transferred to one of the High Wycombe
 Grammar Schools (by selection exam),or
 to the Secondary School next door.    
      At the moment there is a move    
 afoot to close this{Bartholomew       
{Tipping's}School.This is meeting with 
 much local opposition.
