		<title>02Ramsden Village</title>
		<content>Walking through Ramsden refreshed me.  
I forgot my bulky kit and hunger, but  
my mind was spellbound for the beauty  
of Ramsden. Ramsden appears as an old  
pubby place. In the taverns I could    
imagine an old, musty, mothbally smell 
where men drank beer laughing happily. 
Outside was completly different; a     
beautiful village without pollution by 
vehicles. It seemed like a new world   
free of evil.                          
Would it be different when children    
returned from school? Would it spring  
back to life? Would cars start and     
Ramsden begin to be noisy?             
Ramsden is an elaborate expensive      
village with names on the cottages     
like The Dog, Ladysmith and Wychwood   
Lodge, where was parked #100,000       
worth of cars.                         
Today Ramsden is being modernisied for 
trendy families.                       </content>
