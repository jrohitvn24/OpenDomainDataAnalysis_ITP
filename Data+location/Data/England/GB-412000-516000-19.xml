		<title>19South Cleatlam</title>
		<content> South Cleatlam is a hamlet of 50 stone
 fronted houses built in 1905 on either
 side of the road between Staindrop    
 and Winston.  It was built to house   
 the miners who worked in a new drift  
 mine on the southern limit of the     
 Durham coalfield at Westholme, but    
 this never opened. The houses have    
 been described as a "blot on the      
 landscape" being out of character     
 cheap housing with the benefit of no  
 facilities save a telephone and a post
 box.                                  
 Little Newsham is little changed this 
 century as it still remains the       
 property of Newsham Hall which owns   
 the surrounding 529 acres of mixed    
 parkland and arable cropland.   The   
 impressive early Georgiam Hall owned  
 by Guy Beadon has eight other         
 dwellings,a small chapel and a smithy.
