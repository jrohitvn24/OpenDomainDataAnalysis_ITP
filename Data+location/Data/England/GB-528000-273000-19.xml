		<title>19Traffic in N.St Ives.</title>
		<content> Most people drive vehicles.Half of    
 those people have had an accident.    
 Most people ride bikes.Some of them   
 have witnessed accidents and believe  
 it or not one person had an accident  
 on a zebra crossing.Not many people   
 have had accidents on bikes.Most of   
 the people who have,remember them.    
 A lot of people use a Pelican         
 Crossing.There is one person though   
 who says that she just dashes straight
 across.The people who walk to school  
 or work don't live further than 2     
 miles away.There is a very dangerous  
 road infront of our school but luckily
 there is a lollypop lady for safety   
 reasons.Car and coach are the most    
 popular forms of transport but some   
 people prefer walking.Some people     
 would use public transport if it was  
 improved to expected standards,but    
 most people would prefer to use a car.</content>
