		<content> West Bromwich has 'good grounds'      
 meaning that with a popular park,West 
 Bromwich town centre and local        
 cinema,there can hardly come a time   
 when you can say that there is no     
 where to go.These places are great to 
 go in mornings or afternoons but in   
 the evenings most of the places close 
 except for the parks,which parents    
 tell you are "too dangerous" when it  
 is dark.So where do you go? Churches  
 and chapels sometimes hold various    
 kinds of clubs one or two nights a    
 week.Schools and nurseries are evenly 
 spread out, so children are occupied  
 most of the day.But what does the     
 older generation do? Look after family
 or spend the evening in a             
 pub.Unemployment is high with little  
 work available to keep these people   
 off the streets. Stephanie Jukes 14
