		<title>20THE RAILWAYS IN BARROW</title>
		<content> The Midland line in Barrow upon Soar  
 was built in 1840 and served local    
 industry, local people and the Quorn  
 Hunt, whose Kennels are to be found on
 Melton Lane. The Great Central Railway
 Act of 1893 enabled work to start in  
 1895 on the line between Loughborough 
 and Leicester by-passing Barrow but   
 with a station at Quorn and Woodhouse.
 The stations were used in the war     
 years '39-'45 by the Government for   
 the delivery of ammunition.The Prince 
 of Wales used the station when he came
 hunting. After 1926 and the General   
 Strike the Railways went steadily     
 downhill and became less prosperous.  
 Barrow upon Soar no longer has a      
 station. It was axed in the           
 1960's.Crossley Close is built on the 
 site of the old station. Barrow upon  
 Soar has 3 bridges which are used by  
 road traffic and 1 footbridge.{CLASS 7</content>
