		<title>04Gunton Estate Farms</title>
		<content> The Gunton estate which in early 19th 
century extended to 17,000 acres       
(including the holiday resort of       
Cromer) and all the farms in the       
surrounding villages had been reduced  
to a mere 2,000 acres when it was sold 
in 1980. All the farms are now         
privately owned Cottages having  been  
sold or let at very low rents to       
estate workers,many of whom have lived 
there all their lives. There are       
building restrictions on many of       
these. Most have been restored and     
modernised but a few remain in the     
original state. The old Rectory has    
been converted to four dwellings.      
 Farm buildings,particulaily barns are 
increasingly being converted to        
exclusive residential properties for   
use by city workers and retired people.
