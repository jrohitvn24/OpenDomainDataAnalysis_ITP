		<content> The mine was started in 1983. It      
 belongs to the N.C.B. but Faircloughs 
 do the work.  It is a gigantic hole   
 covering 130 acres and is 140' deep.  
 There are three seams of coal, the    
 thickest is 1 metre.  The coal is     
 obtained by first removing the soil   
 and rocks.  This is done by machines  
 like power shovels or scrapers.  One  
 machine's bucket scooped up 24 tons of
 rock in one go.  If rocks are hard,   
 explosives are used to loosen them.  A
 coal remover is a drag-line which has 
 a bucket hung from a long arm.  The   
 drag-line pulls the bucket and picks  
 up the coal, lorries take the coal to 
 disposal points to mix with other     
 coal.  800 tons of coal are mined each
 day.  71 men are employed, and will be
 for 3 years.
