		<title>15NATURE,TATTON PARK KNUTSFORD</title>
		<content>   Tatton Park is very old with early  
 settlements dating back to Saxon      
 times.                                
   In 1290 permission was given to     
 fence off Tatton Park so the owner    
 could keep deer. Today the 2,000 acres
 of Parkland still contain 293 red deer
 and 556 fallow deer. There are also   
 flocks of soya sheep, which are browny
 gold in colour and come from an island
 in Scotland.                          
   Tatton Park has many trees including
 oak, beech, lime, horse- and sweet-   
 chestnut, Scots pine, sycamore, elm,  
 larch and hawthorn.                   
   Also there is almost every native   
 animal you could imagine except       
 badgers.                              
   The Park has 2 meres, Melchett and  
 Tatton. They contain pike, bream,     
 perch, carp, tench, roach and rudd.
