		<content>   Hythe is one of the historic{Cinque 
{Ports}being found on the South-east   
 coast of Kent; about four miles from  
{Folkestone}to the east and with       
{Dungeness}to the west. {The Church of 
{St. Leonards}high to the north of     
 Hythe overlooks this quaint seaside   
 resort which mercifully is free from  
 the onward march of the slot machine  
 and ubiquitous fair ground.  Between  
 the beach and the shopping area is the
{Royal Military Canal,}built for the   
 defence of Britain during the         
{Napoleonic War.                       
   In times past, Hythe was reknowned  
 for smuggling.  In consequence, there 
 were a number of pubs built in        
 connection with this.                 
   Every two years, Hythe holds the    
{Venetian Fete}on the{Royal Military   
{Canal}which is opened by the{Mayor of 
{Hythe.                                </content>
