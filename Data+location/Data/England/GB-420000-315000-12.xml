		<title>12THE HOUSEHOLD</title>
		<content>   In our survey,we found that most of 
 the people had lived in the area for  
 less than 30 years.Of these,most had  
 moved in less than 20 years ago.      
   The most popular item of household  
 equipment was a television set,and    
 almost every house had a telephone.   
   The next most popular items         
 were washing machines and fridges.    
   Next came freezers.                 
   Dishwashers,micro-wave cookers,video
 recorders,tumble driers and computers 
 were found mainly in the houses of    
 younger people,so they were less      
 common.                               
   Most families had at least one car. 
   There are no big shops in the area  
 so most people do their shopping for  
 food and clothes in the towns,especi- 
 ally Burton on Trent.
