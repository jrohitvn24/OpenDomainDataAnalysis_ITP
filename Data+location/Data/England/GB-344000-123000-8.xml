		<content> There is a recreation park that I ride
 up to on my bike.  At the recreation  
 park there is a slide, a round-a-bout,
 a see-saw and some swings.  There is a
 football field, tennis courts and a   
 cricket square.                       
 I ride my bike or I go round the farm 
 and help daddy feed the cows or put   
 the bales in the barn.  Sometimes I   
 put the hay in the manger, then I feed
 the bull.                             
 I go fishing in the river.  We always 
 use maggots and we make our own ground
 bait from bread, elderberries and     
 water.  I have a lO ft. rod and I use 
 lOlbs. line.  I have a tackle box.  In
 it are 7 floats, 3 lots of weights, 2 
 disgorgers, 2 swimfeeders and 2       
 fishing books.  The biggest fish I    
 have caught is a roach. I also catch  
 trout, pike, tench, perch, eels, bream
 and barbel.                           </content>
