		<title>20THE DOMESDAY SURVEY</title>
		<content>This area which covers Kings Norton,   
Druids Heath and the Hawkesly and Poole

housing estates and the rolling pasture
lands of the farms in Worcestershire.  
The last few years has seen the        
building of the Hollywood by-pass a    
major dual carriageway which cuts      
through the heart of the farmland.There
