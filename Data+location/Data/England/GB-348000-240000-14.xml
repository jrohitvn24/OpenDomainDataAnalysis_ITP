		<content> Not that much happens in Hereford     
 because it is very small compared to  
 London and other big cities.We have   
 only one professional football club,  
 who are in the fourth division,at the 
 moment.                               
 One of the main interests of the young
 are the{Pop groups.}We like Duran     
 Duran,Wham,Nik Kershaw,Howard Jones   
 and Madonna.                          
 Hereford has{sports}facilities for    
 a large number of activities.Some of  
 the most popular are football,cricket,
 rounders,swimming,archery,tennis,     
 squash,badminton,dancing and judo.    
 Other{pastimes}include watching       
 television and going to discos.       
 One advantage Hereford has is         
 beautiful{countryside}and walking,    
 climbing,fishing and canoeing are     
 popular.Hereford is not large enough  
 to stage major events.                </content>
