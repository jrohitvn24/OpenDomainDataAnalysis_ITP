		<title>20THE FUTURE ?</title>
		<content>    At present, the area of{Ham and    
{Petersham}contains a unique mixture of
 historic buildings, varied types of   
 housing and large areas of natural    
 open space, such as Richmond Park and 
 Ham Common. In the future, there may  
 be greater pressure for new           
 developments but we would hope that   
 any such developments would maintain  
 the character of the area that make it
 one of the most pleasant              
 environments in Greater London.
