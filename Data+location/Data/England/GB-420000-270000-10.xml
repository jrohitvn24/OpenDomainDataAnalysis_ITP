 two classrooms,a hall,a lobby,a       
 kitchen and two toilets. There are{29 
{pupils.}Last year there were 24 and   
 the year before,40.The number varies. 
 They start school at{9.0am}and finish 
 at{3.30pm.                            
{Four}pupils have{school meals,}which  
 are delivered in a van,and the rest   
 have{packed lunches;}none of the      
 children go home for lunch. This is a 
 school rule,partly because only{two   
 children live in the village.They are 
 Sally Wing and her brother, who live  
 in Manor Lane.                        
 There are{two teachers}at the school.

 and she has been the headmistress     
 since September 1983.Mrs. Grimes is   
 the other teacher,and there is also a 
 part-time cleaner and caretaker.      </content>
