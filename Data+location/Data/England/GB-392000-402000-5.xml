		<title>05ST. PAUL'S WARD - OLDHAM</title>
		<content>     We have been studying the locality
 in which we live. It is a {built _up} 
 area,with only small pockets of       
 recently landscaped areas.The         
 buildings are a mixture of old and    
 new,ranging from Hathershaw Hall to   
 our own new school.This locality is   
 dominated by Ashton Road,linking      
 Oldham with Ashton. It is a bus route,
 with shops serving the local area.    
    The three major employers in the   
 ward are the Littlewoods mail order   
 company, Thorn EMI.and Park Cake      
 Bakery.                               
    The housing in the ward is mainly  
 terraced,with a few newer houses.Most 
 of it was built before the second     
 world war,and there is a scheme to    
 rennovate this housing
