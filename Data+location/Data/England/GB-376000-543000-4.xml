		<title>04POPULATION AROUND NENTHEAD</title>
		<content> In 1861 when mining was at its peak   
 2039 people lived in our block.Using  
 the Electoral Roll and School         
 Registers etc. we estimate the present
 population to be 392.The decline in   
 population has followed the decline in
 the mining industry though in the last
 10 years there has been a slight      
 increase.It seems that some people    
 with young children have recently     
 moved from cities to Nenthead in      
 search of a quieter life-style.The    
 relatively cheaper prices of property 
 could also have attracted them here.  
 The majority of retired people have   
 lived in Nenthead all their lives as  
 few people choose to retire here.     
   The harsh climate,lack of job       
 opportunities,increased travel costs  
 to work,unattractive derilect houses, 
 mining property and spoil heaps are   
 all contributing factors to depop.    </content>
