		<title>14FARMING AT BOURNE END</title>
		<content> We interviewed a farmer at Bourne End 
 who owned two neighbouring farms that 
 had a total area of 190 acres.In      
 addition the farmer rented 90 acres.  
 The farmer and his son worked on the  
 farm and his wife helped out at       
 harvest time.They worked a long day   
 usually from 8 a.m.to 8 p.m. seven    
 days a week and had little spare time.
 Although it is a mixed farm the main  
 concern is rearing 160 beef cattle.In 
 addition 6 breeding sows and their    
 litters are raised,and also a few     
 cows for calf rearing.                
 Spring sown barley is grown on 85     
 acres,while the rest is permanent     
 pasture.The oats and some barley are  
 used as cattle feed.The rest is sold  
 for cattle feed and malting.          
 The crops are sown by combine drill   
 which sows the grain and an artificial
 manure at the same time.              </content>
