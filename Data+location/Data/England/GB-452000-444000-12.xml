		<title>12A64 Trunk Road</title>
		<content> This south_west route from York       
 (Eboracum) to Tadcaster (Calcaria) has
 been important since Roman times.It   
 follows in part the course of the old 
 Roman road.In 1745 a Turnpike Act set 
 up a Trust to control the road between
 Tadcaster Bridge and Hob Moor.This was
 part of the Mail Coach run between    
 York and London until the expansion of
 the railways in the 1840s.            
 In 1936 a dual carriage way was built 
 to improve traffic flow between the   
 West Riding industrial conurbation    
 and the East Coast holiday resorts.   
 There was a separate road, cycle track
 and footpath in each direction.The    
 last two have disappeared due to road 
 alterations.Further change came with  
 the construction of bye_passes round  
 Tadcaster, York and Malton.(c.1970)   
 The Ebor Way a 70 mile walk _Helmsley 
 to Ilkley follows the Roman road here.</content>
