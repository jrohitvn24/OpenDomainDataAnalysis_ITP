		<title>06A PENTON HOUSEWIFE</title>
		<content> Mrs. Isherwood is a Penton housewife. 
 In the morning she gets up to feed her
 two cats.  Then she has her breakfast 
 and gets ready to take her two        
 children, a girl and a boy, to school.
 She likes living in Penton, and has   
 been living here for about fifteen and
 a half years.  Most days she goes into
 Andover to do her shopping.  She has  
 no actual paid job and spends her day 
 in the house tidying up or in the     
 garden or entertaining visitors that  
 might drop in.  She has a fairly      
 biggish house and one car.  During the
 afternoon she goes to the local tennis
 club, after this she goes back home,  
 gets in the car and drives away to    
 collect her children from school.  In 
 the evening she goes to the regular   
 Friends of Andover Museum meeting.    
 Mrs. Isherwood lives at Chalcot,      
 Chalkcroft Lane, Penton Mewsey.       </content>
