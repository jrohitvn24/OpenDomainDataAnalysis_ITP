		<title>11STOCK-CAR RACING IN HAILSHAM</title>
		<content>   Every Wednesday at 8.00 there's     
 normally{Bangers}and{Stock Rods       
 but sometimes there's{Mini Stocks.    
{  Bangers}are battered up normal cars,
{Stock Rods}are long sausage shaped    
 cars with wide wheels and{Mini Stocks 
 are old minis.                        
   Later they have what's called       
{Production Cars;}ordinary saloons with
 added body protectors. They go        
 round the track twice to see if they  
 can get a good time. Then after that, 
 if they want to, they have a five lap 
 race and the winner gets Â£5.          
   At the very end the Bangers normally
 have a{Demolition Derby.}They start   
 off the same way but then they're     
 allowed to turn around and go the     
 opposite way, crashing into other cars
 as they go. They carry on until       
 there's one car left.
