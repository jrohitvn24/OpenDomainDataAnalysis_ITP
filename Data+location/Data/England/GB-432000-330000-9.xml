		<title>09HOUSES OLD AND NEW</title>
		<content> The houses on Peebles Close are 2     
 years old but those on Sheridan Street
 are 50_55 years old .The houses on    
 Peebles Close have cavity walls . They
 have trusses on the roof and have     
 concrete tiles. 4 houses on Peebles   
 Close have sheds and 5 have garages.  
 There are 14 houses on Peebles Close. 
 All the houses are detached. They have
 good insulation.On Sheridan St there  
 is a block of terraced houses a block 
 of 4 and 2 detached. They used to have
 an outside toilet but lately have been
 modernised. They have traditional     
 timber roofs with clay tiles. They are
 council houses. The modern houses     
 have bigger gardens than the old ones 
 but don't have chimneys like the old  
 houses do. This is because old houses 
 used to have coal fires and new houses
 don't because smoke isn't allowed to  
 pollute the air. By Colin and Paul.   </content>
