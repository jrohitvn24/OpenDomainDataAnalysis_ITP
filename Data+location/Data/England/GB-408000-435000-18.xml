		<title>18WILSDEN _ LOCAL HISTORY</title>
		<content> Wilsden probably got its name from    
 'Wilsige' which is a reference to a   
 person who first settled in the area. 
 The 'den' comes from an old English   
 word meaning valley. So Wilsden may   
 have received its name from an early  
 name meaning 'Wilsige's valley'.      
 Wilsden is very old and was mentioned 
 in the original Domesday Book. Most   
 people were farmers then. Around 1810 
 mills were built and the village grew 
 as a result of this industrial        
 development. Now most people who live 
 in the village work elsewhere, such as
 the nearby cities of Bradford and     
 Leeds. Wilsden also is a twinned      
 village. Recently it became twinned   
 with Eppeville in France.
