		<title>09East Hyde School Closure</title>
		<content> In{July 1984,}the school bell at{East 
{Hyde J.M.I. School}rang for the last  
 time. In the{September following,}the 
 children transferred to{The Lea School
 in{Harpenden,}which is an open plan   
 school about two miles away. This     
 involved{twelve children}in all, who  
 now travel to school by{coach.        
 Most were{shocked and saddened}when   
 they first heard about the change from
 their teacher.                        
 When they were interviewed{almost a   
{year}later, however,{nearly all}the   
 children were{happy}at their new      
 school.                               
 Although they{missed}their{teacher    
 from{East Hyde,}they{appreciated      
 having more{space, equipment and      
{books.}Practically all have made{new  
{friends}among the children already at 
{The Lea School.
