 One of the buildings at the mill has  
 been cleverly converted to 2 squash   
 courts with spectator gallery,changing
 rooms and showers,a small licensed bar
 and lounge area,a large room with     
 Disco equipment and lights,and a      
 further room with a small Pool Table. 
 There are 150 playing members drawn   
 mainly from the surrounding           
 areas.Courts are bookable and coaching
 is available from a professional.     
 Within the club there are leagues and 
 ladders and inter-club competitions   
 are organised.Various social events   
 are arranged,most activities take     
 place in the evenings and at          
 week-ends.                            
 Immediate future plans include a small
 gymnasium and indoor bowls on the     
 floor above.
