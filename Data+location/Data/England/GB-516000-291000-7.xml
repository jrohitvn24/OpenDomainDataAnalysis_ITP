		<content> The houses in all 12 squares of the   
 survey area we looked at and dated as 
 far back as possible.We found that a  
 few of the houses went back to the    
 17th century,thst about 20% of them   
 were around 75 to 100 years old  but  
 that the rest had been built in the   
 past 20 years.By far the greatest     
 number of them-about 65% were         
 semi-detached with the next higher    
 number being detached with a small    
 number of bungalows and terraced and a
 few cottages and a few farm houses.All
 the houses except the 17th cent. ones 
 were brick built_the majority being   
 tiled there were some slate and about 
 20 thatched in the old part of the    
 village.All the new ones had small    
 gardens except the ones in Main St.   
 had very large ones going down to the 
 fens.
