		<content>   In her spare time my mum does       
cooking, gardening and housework,      
sewing and patchwork and she's a       
Guider.My dad does woodwork, painting  
and cycling.My brother does reading,   
playing with his friends and watching  
T.V.I do cycling, cooking, going to    
Guides and playing with my friends.    
   The most popular hobbies in our area
are gardening and horse-riding.        
   Most people went to Wales last year 
for their holiday.Most of them stayed  
on a campsite.                         
   One lady in our village does        
flower-arranging,another does          
archaeology.                           
   There are several clubs in our      
village.Here are some of them:         
bingo, W.I.,youth club, Brownies,      
darts,Aunt Sally and the Evergreens.   
   We like playing the A-team and      
hopscotch.                             </content>
