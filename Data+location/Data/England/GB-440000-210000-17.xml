		<title>17COOK'S CORNER FARM</title>
		<content>                                       
The farm is strictly outside our area, 
at GR 414136, but we visited it as it  
is fairly typical of farms around      
Freeland. It is owned by Mr Symington  
who lives at The Manor House in Long   
Hanborough.                            
                                       
His farming has changed over the 12    
years that he has owned it. He used to 
keep cattle for meat, now he only grows
crops but he does let animals graze on 
his farm. In spring he does some       
cultivating and fertilizing and sows   
crops, in summer he deals with the     
harvest and burns stubble and in autumn
he ploughs and most of his crops are   
sown. He has one old age pensioner to  
help him with odd jobs like cutting    
grass and driving tractors. He also    
keeps 23 hens, 8 geese and about 24    
cockerels for Christmas.               </content>
