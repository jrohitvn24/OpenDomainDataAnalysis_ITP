		<title>13The Gondola, Coniston Water</title>
		<content> The{Gondola}is a magnificent restored 
{steam yacht}which runs a regular      
 passenger service on Coniston Water.  
 The original vessel was built in 1859,
 but had fallen into disrepair, lying  
 half-submerged at the south end of the
 lake. The{National Trust}decided to   
 restore her, and with the aid of a    
 public appeal, and grants from the    
 Countryside Commission and the        
 Tourist Board, Vickers Shipbuilding   
 (Barrow) rebuilt the hull and         
 superstructure. In spring 1980 the    
 completed hull was{relaunched}on      
 Coniston. The ceremony was performed  
 by Mrs. Howell, great grand-daughter  
 of Captain Hammel, Master of Gondola  
 from 1863 to 1913. The Gondola's      
{inaugural voyage}took place in June   
 1980, with the Duke of Devonshire as  
 passenger of honour.
