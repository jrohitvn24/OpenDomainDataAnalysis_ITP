		<content> In the school there are 3 classes with
 a teacher each.{Class 1}- Mr.Tingay - 
 Headmaster{Class 2}- Mrs Wilkinson    
{Class 3}-Mrs Hughes.The  children     
 start in class 1 just before they are 
 5.                                    
 There are library corners in each     
 class and we have some modern things  
 like a computer and a photo-copier.   
 There are approx.60 children in the   
 school.Every Tues.the library van     
 comes to school.Mrs Vasey is the cook 
 and the caretaker is Mrs Watson.Hardly
 anyone ever sees her because she comes
 after school.We do P.E. in the Village
 Hall or the field. There is partition 
 between the top and middle classes.It 
 used to be all one big room.There are 
 picture boards on each side.The middle
 and infant classes have whiteboards   
 but the top class has a blackboard    
 because Mr.Tingay prefers them.       </content>
