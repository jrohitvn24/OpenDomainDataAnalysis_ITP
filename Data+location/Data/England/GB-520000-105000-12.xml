		<title>12Local customs</title>
		<content> There are many customs still in the   
 area. The Morris Dancers perform      
 regularly from May Day at St.Mary's   
 Church until September.               
 These dates mark the beginning and    
 ending of the Old Agricultural Year - 
 seed time to harvest.  The dances     
 reflect the old beliefs that the gods 
 had to be pleased and the evil spirits
 driven away to ensure good crops.     
 The pram race is  run for charity. It 
 starts at the British Legion club in  
 Buckingham road and visits all the    
 local public houses. The participants 
 all wear fancy dress.                 
 The Bath tub race is run in August for
 charity on the river Adur from Bramber
 bridge to the Norfolk bridge. People  
 and organisations build a variety of  
 rafts and boats to go down the river. 
 There is a prize for the winner and   
 the best decorated bath tub.          </content>
