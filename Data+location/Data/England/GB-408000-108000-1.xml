		<content>{Verwood,}previously{Fairwood,Fayrwood,
{Wrtwood &amp; Weirwood}is situated on the 
 Hampshire &amp; Dorset border and became a
 Civic Parish in 1894. Previously it's 
 history was recorded under Cranborne. 
 Its{altitude}above sea level varies   
 between 70 and 130 feet. The{climate  
 is mild and the average{rainfall}is   
 approximately 32 inches. The clay and 
 sand deposits gave rise to potteries  
 and brick and tile yards in the early 
 1900's, with the heath providing      
 materials for besom making, fodder &amp;  
 peat. To the north and east lie areas 
 of coniferous forests and to the west 
 are mixed farms. There are two tracks 
 of heath which are of SSI. The shops  
 garages, services and supermarket meet
 the everyday requirments of most      
 people. There is a 2 hourly{bus       
{service,}supplemented by privately run
 buses, none of which run on Sundays.  </content>
