		<title>12MY FAVOURITE SUBJECT</title>
		<content> My favourite subject at school is     
 swimming.The size off the pool is 7.5 
 metres length ways and 5 metres width 
 ways,and nearly 1 metre deep.It is out
 of doors and is not heated.It is      
 painted blue.In the summer we use it  
 everyday if the temperature is over   
 60.It is also in use in the summer    
 holidays for 10p a go,but it is only  
 opened to playgroup children and      
 children who go to the school.We have 
 two changing rooms,one for the girls  
 and one for the boys.They are not very
 big and have got benches and pegs in  
 them.We have a cover which we put on  
 every night which makes the pool      
 warmer.
