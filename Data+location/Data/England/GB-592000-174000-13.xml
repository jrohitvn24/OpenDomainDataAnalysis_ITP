		<title>13Entertainment in Sheerness</title>
		<content>      Sheerness once supported three   
{cinemas}and a{music hall}/ theatre    
 within a half mile radius. These were 
 the Rio, the Argosy, the Ritz and the 
 Hippodrome.                           
      Today there is only one cinema   
 which is privately owned and shares   
 its building with a discotheque and   
 snooker club. This decline in         
{entertainment}facilities is a         
 reflection of the reduced demand since
 the closure of the naval dockyard.    
      Sheppey Little{Theatre}is run and
 maintained by voluntary organisations.
 These people raised the money and     
 converted a church into a theatre with
 seating for about 150 people.         
      Amateur theatre groups and choirs
 present various works during the year.
 The theatre is also used by children  
 from local clubs who produce an annual
 pantomime.                            </content>
