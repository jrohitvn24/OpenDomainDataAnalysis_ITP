		<title>10HIGH OXCLOSE FARM-WASHINGTON</title>
		<content> The oldest building in Blackfell      
 Village is High Oxclose Farm. There   
 has been a farm house on the site for 
 over 150 years, although the present  
 house was built about 80 years ago.   
 The owner Mr. Hankey moved there in   
 1929 from Esh Winning, County Durham  
 and continued to farm until the       
 Washington Development Corporation    
 acquired the land for the building of 
 Blackfell Village in the 1970's       
  Now there is no farm left, the house 
 and large garden are the only         
 reminders of the agricultural past of 
 the area.                             
  Originally the area where Blackfell  
 is now situated was called High       
 Oxclose but when the villages were    
 named the area to the north, Black    
 Fell was chosen.
