		<title>17Wellhouse village.</title>
		<content>      Wellhouse probably gets its name 
 from the number of wells around the   
 village. There are a number of weavers
 cottages around the small village     
 green, a wuzzing hole can still be    
 seen in one. The local Liberal Club   
 has a mural of early village life     
 whilst the Cott is a small pub        
 converted from a weavers cottage.     
     The original Methodist chapel was 
 opened in 1844. The Sunday School was 
 built on another site and has also    
 been used as a school since 1882.     
 The old chapel was demolished in 1967 
 and a new one established in the      
 former infant classroom. The school   
 building has three storeys on the     
 south east side and one on the north  
 west side, the lower storey being two 
 cottages.
