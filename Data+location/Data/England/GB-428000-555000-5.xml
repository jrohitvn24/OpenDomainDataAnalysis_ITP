{HOLY TRINITY CHURCH.}The first thing  
 you notice about the church is that it
 is old and it is built on a hill.The  
 Venerable Bede (673-735)tells us how  
 Pope Gregory advised Mellitus,his     
 missionary to Britain in 601,to build 
 churches on sites used for pagan      
 worship. It is possible that this is  
 such a site.                          </content>
