 the centre of the block as far as     
 facilities are concerned.Caldy village
 has no shops,Newton has a very small  
 shopping area,whilst West Kirby has a 
 wide range of shops including two     
 supermarkets.There is new shopping

 shops provides a direct link with     
 Birkenhead and Liverpool,with trains  
 running every 20 minutes.West Kirby is
 also a small bus terminus with        
 frequent services to other parts of   
 the Wirral.
