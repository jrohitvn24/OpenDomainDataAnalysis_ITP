		<title>16A Walk To Stilton School</title>
		<content> We walked to Stilton School as part of
 our Domesday work.Stilton School has  
 eleven members of staff and seven     
 classrooms.It is much bigger than     
 Folksworth School.They have a swimming
 pool for learners and a large dining  
 room.On some afternoons the playgroup 
 and clinic meet at the school.There   
 are about 224 pupils at the school.The
 age range of the school is 5 to       
 11.When the children leave the school 
 they go to Sawtry Village College     
 where they will meet the children from
 Folksworth School.The headteacher of  
 Stilton School is Mr.Wiggin.He is     
 older than the headteacher of         
 Folksworth School.We play football    
 against Stilton School and we also    
 share buses with them if we are going 
 to the same place.
