         {THE RHYME.                   
 With most dobby games you put your    
 foot in the middle. Someone touches   
 each persons foot,saying              
  {"Ip dip dation corporation          
   {How many buses are in the station?"
 Someone says a number between 1_10,   
 and who evers foot it lands on is out.
 The person with the remaining foot is 
 on.                                   
         {DOBBY SCARECROW.}            
 The person who is on has to try and   
 dob the other people.When someone has 
 been caught they have to stand like a 
 scarecrow and wait until someone goes 
 under their arm.The person who is     
 dobbed three times is on.
