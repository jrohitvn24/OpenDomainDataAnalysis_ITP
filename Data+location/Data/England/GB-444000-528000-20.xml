		<content> A man suspected of triple murder and  
 other crimes was arrested in our area 
 on November 5th 1984 after an exciting
 police chase. The suspect, who was    
 subsequently tried and found guilty,  
 lived on a nearby estate and because  
 he knew the countryside well survived 
 for a number of days in various hiding
 places.                               
 Several pupils of Brierton School     
 remember the events surrounding his   
 capture. One recalled seeing          
 coach loads of police arriving and    
 surrounding the Brierton area. Some of
 the police were armed and they        
 marched up the lane to the quarry.    
 Another pupil thought he saw the      
 suspect in the fields before his      
 arrest and was questioned by the      
 police about what he had seen.
