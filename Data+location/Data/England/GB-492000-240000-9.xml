		<title>09COLLEGE OF AERONAUTICS.</title>
		<content>   The{  College  of  Aeronautics}  was
 set up after World War 2 in 1946. They
 design,  make,  test and fit  parts or
 complete aircraft. Most of the work is
 making  or  repairing  parts for other
 firms  or  people.  Everyone  actually
 working there has a  degree in  engin-
 eering, including students,who come to
 Cranfield for a unique training course
 in  aeronautics.  Part of this  unique
 nature stems from the  College  owning
 its own airfield and aircraft.        
  The  College has  many  sophisticated
 testing systems to discover the poten-
 tial of new  and  existing  materials.
 They  have  two  wind tunnels  and  an
 impact centre,  which also  does  test
 work for the automotive industry.     
    In the future the  College plans to
 escalate  their  involvement  in  all 
 fields of aeronautics.
