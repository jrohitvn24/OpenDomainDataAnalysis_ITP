		<content> A village erected as a memorial to the
 victims of the Second World War       
 consists of{20}two storey houses and{ 
{27}bungalows adapted for the use of   
 handicapped veterans of the war. The  
 village is located on Chellaston Road 
 between Sinfin Avenue and Merrill Way.
  The housing is still offered to any  
 ex-serviceman who has received an     
 injury during his service career but  
 also to civilians who have suffered   
 industrial injuries. Residents of the 
 village are suffering from injuries   
 such as paralysis, amputation, and    
 arthritis.
