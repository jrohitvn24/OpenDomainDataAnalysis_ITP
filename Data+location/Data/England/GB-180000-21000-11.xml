		<content>{     ST.KEVERNE PARISH CHURCH         
 The 60 foot tower of St Keverne Church
 dominates the square.  It warns ships 
 of the treacherous Manacle Rocks (one 
 mile off shore).  In 1770 the spire   
 was destroyed by lightning but it was 
 quickly rebuilt because of its        
 navigational importance. In the church
 yard graves are not only of villagers 
 but of people drowned on the Manacles.
 There is a window in memory of the    
 'Mohegan', which was wrecked in       
 1898 with much loss of life and a bell
 in memory of a man's family who       
 drowned. There is a mass grave on the 
 north side of the church with a Celtic
 Cross. The church has 8 bells. On the 
 north wall is a huge 13th Century     
 mural of St. Christopher. It has been 
 a place of Christian worship since 600
 AD though the present church is mostly
 of 15th century origin.               </content>
