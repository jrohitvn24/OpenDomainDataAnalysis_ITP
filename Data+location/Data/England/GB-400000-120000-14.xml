		<title>14VERNDITCH CHASE: BOWERCHALKE</title>
		<content> THE CHASE is situated to the SW and   
 consists of 230 acres of deciduous    
 woodland, 6 acres of hazel coppice and
 90 acres of conifers. It is managed by
 the Forestry Commission whose Ranger  
 lives in the village. It was planted  
 in 1930, but now policy is to increase
 deciduous trees especially beech for  
 high quality timber, phasing out      
 conifers, now sold for wood pulp. One 
 cleared area, privately owned, has    
 rare orchids and butterflies. It has  
 been designated a SITE OF SPECIAL     
 SCIENTIFIC INTEREST. Fees may be paid 
 for wood or for horse riding.         
 CONSERVATION is an important part of  
 its management. The Hampshire Trust   
 for Nature Conservation owns the S &amp;  
 SW edge. A small area in the NW,      
 privately owned is Ancient Forest,    
 together with Chettle Head Copse - 19 
 acres - the last surviving.           </content>
