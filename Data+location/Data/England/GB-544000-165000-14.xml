		<title>14HOUSES IN ORPINGTON</title>
		<content>{Orpington} is mainly a {residential   
area} developed in the 1930s to meet   
the demands caused by the outward      
movement from London. It is a typical  
suburban development being made up of  
detached and semi-detached houses      
being well appointed and having large  
gardens. Today some of the large       
detached houses are being demolished   
to make way for new developments. The  
demand for houses in Orpington is high 
and prices reflect this having risen   
dramatically over the last ten years.  
The expansion of residential           
development has been restricted by the 
Green Belt but nevertheless            
Orpington's urban landscape has been   
described as a {"boring procession of  
middle class housing"}. The older      
Victorian housing is found in St.Mary  
Cray which was the main village before 
the growth of Orpington.               </content>
