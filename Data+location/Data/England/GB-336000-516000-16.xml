		<content> THE COUNTRYSIDE AROUND US IS VERY     
 NICE. THERE ARE LOTS OF VIEWS AND     
 LAKES, BUT THE LAND IS VERY ROCKY.    
 MOST OF THE FIELDS ARE SLOPING, WHICH 
 MAKES FARMING DIFFICULT.  MOST OF THE 
 HOUSES ARE MADE OF STONE. THE VILLAGES
 AROUND US ARE SMALL.  THERE ARE THREE 
 HUNDRED PEOPLE IN GLENRIDDING. SOME OF
 THE HOUSES ARE HOLIDAY HOUSES. THE    
 MOUTAINS ARE QUITE HIGH AROUND        
 HERE.  SOME GO UP TO OVER 3000 FEET   
 LIKE HELVELLYN. THE BIGGEST IS        
 SCAFELL, ALTHOUGH THIS IS SOME WAY    
 AWAY.  THE TREES AROUND  US ARE       
 NORMALY OAK. THERE ARE NOT MANY FLAT  
 AREAS IN THE DALE .THE ONLY FLAT AREAS
 ARE IN BETWEEN THE LAKE AND           
 PATTERDALE.  THIS IS WHERE THE        
 GOLDRILL BECK HAS BROUGHT DOWN A LOT  
 OF MATERIAL TO THE HEAD OF ULLSWATER. 
 MUCH OF OUR AREA WAS EXTENSIVELY      
 CARVED BY ICE IN THE LAST ICE AGE.    </content>
