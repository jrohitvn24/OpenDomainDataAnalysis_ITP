		<title>05Games boys play in Bacup</title>
		<content> Most boys want to play football in    
 their spare time but there are other  
 games such as Tig_in,Tig_out, 21      
 Dares, Atom Bomb, Bulldogs and Kerby  
 that we play.                         
 In{Kerby,}two people stand on the road
 kerb facing each other across the     
 road. Each player throws a ball and   
 tries to hit the opposite kerb. If he 
 does he scores a point and has another
 throw. After 15 throws the one with   
 the highest score is the winner.{     
{                                      
{Atom Bomb}any number can play.They    
 stand at least 2 metres apart. The    
 ball is acting as an atom bomb and    
 will explode if it is missed or       
 touches the floor when thrown. Anyone 
 missing or dropping the ball is out.  
 The winner is the person left in at   
 the end.                              
                                       </content>
