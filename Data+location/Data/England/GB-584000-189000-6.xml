		<title>06Rochford Hall</title>
		<content> Rochford Hall was built in the 1530's.
 It was built out of Tudor bricks which
 are smaller than modern day bricks.   
 The ceiling is made of massive oak    
 beams which are in excellent          
 condition. Rochford Hall's ceilings   
 are about 12 ft high. In 1509 Henry   
 VIII ruled over England, and took     
 Anne Boleyn to be his wife. Anne      
 Boleyn's father owned Rochford Hall at
 the time and so Henry often joined the
 hunting parties. There used to be 8   
 towers, 4 on the outside and 4 on the 
 inside. There is a oak spiral stair   
 case which has been there ever since  
 Rochford Hall's been there. Parts of  
 the manor have been burnt down.       
     Nowadays the house and it's       
 grounds are used as a Golf Club. It   
 has been going since 1893 and has got 
 800 members, 650 of whom play golf.
