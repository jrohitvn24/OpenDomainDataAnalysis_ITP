Saturday 18th June 2011&lt;br />&lt;br />I played on the trampoline then I had lunch. Then I went to my friend’s house for a party. The reason why we went there was because his brother was turning three. &lt;br />&lt;br />I played on the trampoline and then prank called a random person then I  prank called my friend’s mum. I played with Lochan and Gabe, we played hide and seek.&lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
