		<title>01HARROGATE AS A CENTRE</title>
		<content> Harrogate gets its name from{Herrigate
 or{Soldiers}Road.Possibly a military  
 road passed over this area during the 
 Anglian period. During 19th.Cent. a   
 turnpike road ran through the town.   
 In the Middle_Ages the area was       
 covered by a vast forest known as     
 Knaresborough Chase.Unfortantly this  
 was destroyed during the 18th. Cent.  
 when Harrogate was in the parish of   
 Knaresborough. Harrogate is the       
 areas largest town. It achieved fame  
 as a spa and is now a conference      
 centre. It's original claim to fame as
 a spa was in the 18th.Cent., but the  
 first spring was discovered by William
 Slingsby in 1571.The town soon grew,  
 and became one of the leading spas in 
 the country. A spring can still be    
 seen in the Royal Pump Room - now a   
 museum. The hotels and restaurants.   
 now support tourism and conferences.  </content>
