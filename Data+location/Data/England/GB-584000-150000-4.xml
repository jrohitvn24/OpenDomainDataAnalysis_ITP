		<content> The area contains some stark contrast 
 that compare the unchanging rural     
 community  with the needs of a modern,
 prosperous and mobile society. The old
 village of Harrietsham is the largest 
 grouping of houses. Most of the       
 houses are well over fifty years old. 
 In compleat contrast the council      
 housing estates immediately south of  
 the parish church represent sound     
 modern housing of modest form, while  
 at Lakelands adjoining the railway    
 expensive modern housing can be seen  
 on an estate of private houses.  The  
 village has as yet suffered little    
 change, remaining basically a rural   
 community on an important road link.  
 The proposed M20 motorway may well    
 change that.
