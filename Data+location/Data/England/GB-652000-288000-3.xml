		<title>03PAKEFIELD VILLAGE &amp; EROSION</title>
		<content>{Pakefield},once an important {fishing}
village in the Middle Ages, is now     
part of Lowestoft. It is much          
smaller than it was at the beginning   
of the 19th century. The   main reason 
for this is that the cliff and the     
town have been {eroded} by the sea.    
Before the groynes were   contructed,  
the sea washed away much  of the land  
and the houses that were built on      
it. Since 1800 over 200 acres and      
over 120 houses have been eaten up     
by the sea. The Parish church of All   
Saints and St. Margaret which, in 1800 
was over a half mile from the sea, is  
now only 10 metres from the edge of    
the cliff. Traditionally the           
inhabitants of Pakefield have depended 
upon the sea and the soil for their    
living. Today, the fishermen's cottages
are mixed with new properties - these  
are often used as {holiday} homes.     </content>
