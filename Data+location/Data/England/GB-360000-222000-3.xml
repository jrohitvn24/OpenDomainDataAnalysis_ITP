		<content> As can be seen from the detailed count
 in only one 1kmx1km square Ross has 2 
 banks, 5 building societies, 2 medium 
 sized supermarkets, 12 specialist-    
 type food shops, 16 clothes shops,4 do
 it-yourself centres,the main South    
 West Gas showroom &amp; MEB showroom.There
 are 5 small restaurants &amp; cafes,3 new-
 sagents,2 pubs &amp; 3 take_away foodshops
 _2 fish &amp; chips, one Indian food. Of  
 the 21 'other shops' we can offer the 
 visiting tourists the choice of goods 
 from video hire to floral arrangements
 &amp; old pine furniture to saddlery.Most 
 of the premises offer flats &amp; housing 
 facilities 'above the shop',most used 
 by the owners.Only the banks and show-
 rooms do not have this facility. It   
 must be remembered that the block all-
 ocation has split the town in half and
 to obtain a full analysis the previous
 block's details should be studied.    </content>
