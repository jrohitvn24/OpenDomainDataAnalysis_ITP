		<title>16Railway Station,Paddock Wood</title>
		<content>Paddock Wood Railway Station is situate
along the line from London to coast,   
stopping at Folkstone,Dover,Deal and   
Sandwich. This is important for both   
passengers and for trade to the        
continent. The station was opened in   
1842 and was then called Maidstone Road
Station. It accounted for much of the  
growth of Paddock Wood at this time.   
It was the main source of employment   
and it brought people to settle in the 
village from the neighbouring towns and
villages. There are four platforms and 
about ten trains per hour pass through.
Five people are employed here and work 
in eight hour shifts. The first train  
leaves at 6.12 a.m. and the last train 
leaves at eleven minutes past midnight.
