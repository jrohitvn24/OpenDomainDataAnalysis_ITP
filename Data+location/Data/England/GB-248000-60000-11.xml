		<title>11REDEVELOPMENT IN ROBOROUGH</title>
		<content> At the moment we have a lot of        
 farmland in the area that is about to 
 be redeveloped. Darklake is one of    
 these farms, also Broadley,Porsham and
 Roborough. There are going to be two  
 more industrial estates built.The     
 large estate will have several smaller
 factories,and the other area is for   
 Plessey.Plessey is already being      
 built.A new Tesco supermarket is half 
 built,and will be open in 1986. There 
 will probably be a newsagent, a post  
 office, a bank and a chemist in the   
 Tesco precinct.The Woolwell housing   
 estate will have 1200 houses. Some are
 already built. The houses will be     
 built by different developers so that 
 they do not all look the same. There  
 will be a primary school, four play   
 parks and open space for walking.     
 There are plans for a health centre   
 and possibly a community hall.        </content>
