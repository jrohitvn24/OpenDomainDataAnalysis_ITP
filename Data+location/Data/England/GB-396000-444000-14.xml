		<title>14A DAY AT MALSIS SCHOOL:1</title>
		<content> Every morning we are woken at 7.00am. 
 After dressing,we stroll down the     
 drive for some fresh air.This is      
 followed by breakfast.Next we have a  
 short time in which we prepare for    
 morning lessons.After this we go to   
 Prayers in our chapel,though on       
 Saturdays we have House meetings.     
 At 8.45 we begin 5 morning lessons    
 which are split up after the first    
 three by a long break.The break is    
 lengthy as boys are required to change
 library books,visit the Bookshop,visit
 the doctor if necessary,practise      
 musical instruments or catch up with  
 any work which they might have to     
 do.Otherwise we play games outside.   
 The lessons are followed by lunch     
 which in turn is often followed by a  
 silent reading period at which time   
 the school choir sometimes practises.
