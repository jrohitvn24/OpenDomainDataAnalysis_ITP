		<title>11Dennis's Day Part 2</title>
		<content>  When Neil comes out we play Bunging  
 with his ball.  First of all we make  
 teams then 1 team goes down one end of
 the playground and the other goes down
 the other end.  Then we keep throwing 
 the ball to and fro and try and score,
 but if someone catches your throw you 
 are out and you cannot throw again    
 until the next game.  At 10.50 it is  
 time to go in and we do English, Maths
 or Religious Education until lunch    
 time.  We can have sandwiches or      
 school dinner.  After dinner we have  
 another playtime until 1.15 when we go
 in, then the first one to sit down is 
 worst, the second is best, the third  
 is the one with the hairy chest and   
 the last the dirty donkey.  If we go  
 swimming we get changed in the Boys'  
 Toilets.  We have a story last thing  
 then I get the bus home.
