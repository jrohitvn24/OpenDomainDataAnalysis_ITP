		<content> We have six sheep. One of them is     
 called Grey Face, another is Smokey   
 and the rest are called Curly, Brown  
 Face, Roman Nose I and Roman Nose     
 II. Between them they have had nine   
 lambs. We haven't named them all but  
 we have named three of them and they  
 are called Henry, Sooty and Sweep.The 
 only ones that I can recognise are    
 Henry and Sooty because Sooty is all  
 black and Henry is the only one with a
 white face.                           
 I saw one being born. First came the  
 fluid and then the lamb came. It      
 wasn't a very pretty sight. Its mum   
 licked it as it had been born to get  
 the membrane off. After its mum licked
 the membrane off,the lamb immediately 
 tried to stand up on its very wobbly  
 legs.
