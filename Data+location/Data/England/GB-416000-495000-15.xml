		<content> We made asurvey on games played in the
 playground.There were 37 different    
 games played.The most popular game    
 played was{tig}.The second popular was
{kingy}which often known as Ball Tig.  
 The third most popular was{football}. 
                                       
 For a game of {ball tig}you need a    
 soft ball and a group of people.One   
 person is chosen as {tig}.Another     
 person is given the ball and throws   
 the ball away.Then the person chosen  
 as tig goes and gets the ball.As soon 
 as he has the ball in his hand he says
 "FREEZE",the group of people has to   
 stand still.The person with the ball  
 takes 5 stides to the nearest person. 
 He throws the ball at that person and 
 if he misses he will start all over   
 again.If he hits someone then that    
 person will start the game again.
