		<content> Our area incorporates Great Brickhill 
 ,Stoke Hammond and Stockgrove Park.   
 The land is mostly hilly but          
 partly flat.Our square is quite       
 important for transport because it    
 contains the Grand Union Canal which  
 was the main canal to London. Also the
 railway from London to Liverpool      
 Birmingham, Manchester, North Wales   
 and Glasgow. There is a road that goes
 from Milton Keynes to Aylesbury and   
 Leighton Buzzard.Most of our area is  
 taken up by farming for horses and    
 rough grazing for other cattle.       
 There is alao a Stud Farm.The         
 Traditional Industries were mostly    
 carried out at home such as Lace      
 Making,Straw Plaiting and Cord        
 Waining.Other occupations like the    
 Baker and the Blacksmiths had their   
 own shops to do their jobs and they   
 employed people to work with them.    </content>
