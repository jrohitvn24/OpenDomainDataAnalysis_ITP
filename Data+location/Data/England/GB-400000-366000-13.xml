		<content>{The Flash Loyal Union Society }       
 started in 1846, 139 years ago. It is 
 a club when, if any one is sick and   
 they can't go to work, they pay the   
 person who is sick 60p a week. Before 
 they receive the money, they have to  
 say{"Dear Brother (or sister), it has 
{pleased God to afflict me so serverly 
{with (here mention the complaint)     
{that I am incapable of following my   
{usual employment."}When the person is 
 better then they say to the male (or  
 female) vistor of Flash Loyal Union   
 society, Buxton{"Dear  Brother (or    
{sister,) through the blessing of God I
{am so far recovered as to be inclined 
{for the present to give up our        
{society's sick allowance."}           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
