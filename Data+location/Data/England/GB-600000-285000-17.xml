 Kenninghall, he is Dr.Tom Rayner. The 
 nearest{hospitals}are in Norwich,     
 which is 18 miles away or Bury St.    
 Edmunds which is 20 miles away. We    
 have{disrict nurses}in the area who   
 travel around the countryside         
 attending all those who need extra    
 medical help and also{mid-wives}for   
 home confinements.                    
 There is usually a welfare{clinic }   
 every fortnight for the infants in    
 the area and these are held at the    
 local village halls.                  
 The nearest{dentist}is in East Harling
 which is about 3 miles away.          
 In an emergency{ambulances}have to    
 come from the larger places like      
 Thetford or Diss, these places are 9  
 miles away.
