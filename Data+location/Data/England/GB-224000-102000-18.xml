		<title>18Local Opinion in Bridgerule</title>
		<content>  Many of the older residents were     
 interviewed and asked several         
 questions. The replies varied a little
 but the following are the more        
 standard replies.                     
  Life in Bridgerule is friendly and   
 all the residents are concerned for   
 the welfare of each other. The church 
 and chapel are focal points for       
 community life as is the local primary
 school.                               
  There is a new small housing estate  
 and now only one public house whereas 
 before there were three. It has not   
 changed a lot in appearance but       
 socially there is more happening.     
 There is also less industry.          
   The growth of the village in terms  
 of housing is a change for the better 
 but the loss of industry is deemed    
 detrimental to the lifestyle here.
