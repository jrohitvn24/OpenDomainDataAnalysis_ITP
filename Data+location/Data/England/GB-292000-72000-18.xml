		<title>18TEIGNMOUTH BUS SERVICE</title>
		<content> Teignmouth does not have a bus station
 building. However there are five bus  
 stops near to each other around the   
 Triangle, a place in the centre of    
 town.                                 
   There are eleven different bus      
 routes from Teignmouth's Triangle to  
 surrounding towns and villages. For   
 example there are three different     
 routes from Teignmouth to Newton      
 Abbot. Twenty-seven buses leave for   
 Newton Abbot every day between Monday 
 and Saturday. There are five buses on 
 Sundays and Bank Holidays. Teignmouth 
 has a bus service carrying passengers 
 from the outskirts of the town to the 
 centre and back.                      
   It is possible to buy an "Explorer" 
 ticket which allows you to travel     
 anywhere in Devon. The cost for an    
 adult is Â£2.50 and for a child Â£1.25. 
 A family ticket costs Â£5.00.          </content>
