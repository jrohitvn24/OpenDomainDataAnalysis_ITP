		<title>07REDBOURN BY_PASS CONT</title>
		<content>   An exhibition and public meeting was
 held in{Redbourn Village Hall}in{June 
{1979}.People were able to see the     
 alternative ideas and raise any       
 questions.                            
   The plan which was finally chosen   
 has the{By_Pass}starting on the{Hemel 
{Hempstead Road}just to the East of the
{M1}flyover.It runs North_Eastwards    
 along the route of a disused railway. 
 There is a roundabout junction with   
 the{A5}just South of the village and  
 the By_Pass continues N.E.to a second 
 roundabout at{Harpenden Lane}.The     
 By_pass then curves North_West to link
 up with the{A5}again just North of the
 village.                              
   Since the By Pass has been opened a 
 tremendous decrease in the amount of  
 traffic using the High Street and the 
 two junction of the (B487).{
