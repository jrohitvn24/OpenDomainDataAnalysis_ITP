		<title>17STEDE HILL HOUSE</title>
		<content>     Stede hill occupies a prominent   
 position on the south slope of the    
 North Downs some nine miles east of   
 Maidstone and little more than one    
 mile north of the village of          
 Harrietsham. It has been known by many
 names in the past, "Stedehill", "Stede
 Court", "Harrietsham Place",and       
 "Harrietsham Hill".                   
     The external walling is of brick  
 of unusual thickness, in places it    
 measures three feet. Removal of the   
 internal Georgian plasterwork this    
 century, revealed Tudor arches. All   
 the internal walls were timber framed 
 with brick infilling. The beams       
 carrying the first floor were         
 elaborately moulded and a decorative  
 plaster frieze carried motifs of the  
 Tudor Rose and fleur-de lis. The      
 original architecture has been changed
 by Georgian reconstruction.           </content>
