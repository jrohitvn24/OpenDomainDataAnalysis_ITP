		<title>03The Town Centre Bridlngton</title>
		<content> The Promenade is one of Bridlington's 
 main shopping streets. Here can be    
 found Boot's the Chemists and a       
 variety of smaller shops, cafes, etc  
 The town's bus station was also on the
 Promenade but is now a car park. As   
 one moves away from the town centre   
 land use changes to accomodate a bingo
 hall, bowling green, supermarket and  
 the "Three b's" theatre.              
 Buidings in the town are in the main  
 undistinguished despite a number of   
 old frontages. There are two          
 exceptions, Binn's department store,  
 4 storeys high, and the 11 storey     
 Ferndale flats near South Cliff       
 Gardens. The other large stores in the
 town are Woolworth's and Marks        
 &amp; Spencers.                           
 Twice weekly in King Street there is  
 an open market of some 40 stalls      
 selling mixed goods.                  </content>
