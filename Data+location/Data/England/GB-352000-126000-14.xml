		<content> Most of the people in this village    
 have weekly news papers.The most      
 popular papers are Western Gazette    
 (produced in Yeovil) and the Central  
 Somerset Gazette(produced in Wells).  
  They have those papers for the local 
 news and sport.                       
 The very local news is in "Tidings",a 
 parish magazine produced  by the      
 church and printed in the school.It   
 contains a letter from the vicar and  
 details of services for the month.It  
 also tells us what has been happening 
 in the villages, such as whist        
 drives,Wednesday Club, W.I.meetings   
 and so on.                            
  This month's magazine contains an    
 account of the P.T.A.Carnival.This    
 is organised by the Parent Teacher    
 Association to raise money for the    
 school.
