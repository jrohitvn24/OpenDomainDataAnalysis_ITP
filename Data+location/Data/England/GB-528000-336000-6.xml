		<title>06Fenland Farming -Kirton Area</title>
		<content>    Crops grown in this area are used  
 in many different ways.  The sugar    
 beet is made into sugar at a local    
 factory.  The vegetables go to the    
 fresh market or to be frozen or       
 canned.  Some wheat is exported.      
 There is no livestock because the land
 is too good for animals to graze on.  
    The farmland in this area is very  
 flat.  As you look across the fields  
 you can see long distances and there  
 are few trees.  The farmers do not    
 like trees or bushes in their fields  
 because they take up a lot  of room   
 and the soil is too expensive for     
 that.                                 
    However, they are planting trees in
 small spinnies and hedges to try and  
 preserve some natural habitat.
