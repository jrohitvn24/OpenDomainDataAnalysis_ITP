		<title>05Linseed crops in Newark</title>
		<content>{ Linseed}or flax is grown for two     
 purposes, linen from the stem and oil 
 from the seed.  In this area it is    
 grown only for the{oil.} This         
 vegetable oil is used for cooking,    
 having the benefit that is rich in    
 polyunsaturates.  The benefit to      
 farmers is that it gives the land a   
 rest after the intensive cereal       
 growing common to this area.  There is
 an unusually large crop in Newark, the
 farmer who grows it being a           
 specialist.  He has made it the       
 biggest crop in Notts. and probably in
 the country.  First the seed is sown  
 and then a plant with a distinctive   
{blue}flower grows.  The new seeds form
 and swell.  The plants are sprayed to 
 dessicate the straw.  After harvest,  
 the seeds yield 50% oil.  A field of  
 linseed looks like a sea of blue.
