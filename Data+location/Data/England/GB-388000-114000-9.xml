		<title>09WEST LODGE NEAR STUBHAMPTON</title>
		<content>    West Lodge is the site of one of   
 the ancient lodges of the Royal       
 hunting grounds of Cranborne Chase.   
 The original lodge was known to have  
 existed at the end of the 16th century
 but nothing seen above the ground     
 today is likely to be of so early a   
 date.                                 
    The present building is of the     
 first half of the 18th century with   
 early 19th century single-storey      
 wings. It is believed that John Pitt, 
 a distant cousin of William Pitt the  
 Elder, was responsible for many of the
 architectural niceties  found at the  
 Lodge. The central pavilion of the    
 south front with its full Tuscan      
 portico has many of the features found
 at Blenheim Palace.                   
    One of the last Royalty to hunt in 
 the grounds was Edward VII.
