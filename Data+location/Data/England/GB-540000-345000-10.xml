		<content> Another family business is the local  
 garage which is situated on the main  
 road.It serves petrol and services    
 cars and is an M.O.T.station.They have
 the {Hyundai }franchise and sell new  
 and used cars of many other makes     
 and there is an accident repair shop  
 which resprays and repairs damaged    
 vehicles.It opens at 8-00am and closes
 at 8-00pm in the summer or 6-00pm in  
 the winter six days per week.         
 Our local builder not only builds     
 houses but also erects farm buildings 
 of all types and has built two nearby 
 village halls. He will also carry out 
 repairs and maintenance and build     
 extensions to existing properties.As  
 very little new building is done in   
 the village much of his work is       
 carried out elsewhere in the          
 surrounding area.
