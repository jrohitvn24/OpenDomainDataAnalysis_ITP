		<title>08Denby School - l913</title>
		<content> The school was built in 1865. In l913 
 there were {110 pupils }in the        
 school.  They were divided into three 
 classes with three teachers.  The     
 infants' class standards 1,2 3, and 4 
 and the Headteacher was Mr.Jelfs.     
 He lived next door to the school.  The
 children's started school at five and 
 left when they were 14. When they were
{13 years old}they went to the{mills in
{Denby Dale}for half the week and      
 stayed in school for the other half.  
 Some children left the school at 11 to
 go to Penistone Grammar School.  A lot
 of children came from Ingbirchworth   
 Village as there was no school there. 
 There were{no school dinners}so the   
 children brought a packed lunch or    
 went home.                            
 The boys played in the top  yard and  
 the girls in the bottom yard,         
 separated by a gate.                  </content>
