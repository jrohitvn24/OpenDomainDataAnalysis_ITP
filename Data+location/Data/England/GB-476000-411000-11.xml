		<title>11TETLEY HALL VISIT.</title>
		<content> ONE DAY WE WENT TO TETLEY. THE PRETTY,
 TREE-LINED AVENUE LED TO THE HALL. IVY
 COVERED THE FRONT OF THE ONE HUNDRED  
 AND FIFTY YEAR OLD BUILDING. ENTERING 
 THE FRONT HALL WE SAW IT'S WIDE       
 STAIRCASE AND THE BREAKFAST ROOM ON   
 THE MEZZANINE LANDING. THE LARGE      
 DRAWING ROOM HAD A BLAZING LOG FIRE IN
 A FIREPLACE ON WHEELS. ON COLD DAYS   
 THIS COULD BE MOVED INTO THE{CENTRE}OF
 THE ROOM. WE ADMIRED THE{STUBBS}      
 PAINTINGS AND CHIPPENDALE FURNITURE.  
 UPSTAIRS, IN THE BEDROOMS WITH        
 DRESSING ROOMS, WE SAW NO SIGN OF THE{
{GHOST.}OUTSIDE, A PARAPET FROM        
 SPROTBOROUGH CASTLE HAD BEEN MADE     
 INTO A BRIDGE AND HAD BEEN MENTIONED  
 IN SIR WALTER SCOTT'S "{IVANHOE}". IN 
 THE CORNER OF THE BEAUTIFULLY LAWNED  
 GARDENS, WE FOUND A PRIVATE {BURIAL   
{GROUND.}MANY OF THE OWNERS' ANCESTORS 
 HAD BEEN BURIED THERE.                </content>
