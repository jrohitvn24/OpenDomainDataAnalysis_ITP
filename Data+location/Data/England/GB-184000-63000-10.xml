		<title>10ST MAWGAN CRICKET CLUB</title>
		<content> The cricket club was restarted in 1947
 by Jack Trevenna. The club play on the
 village playing field, and have built 
 their own pavillion. Most matches are 
 played in a friendly atmosphere, and  
 involve much of the community- cricket
 teas, spectating, fund raising, annual
 dinner. Matches attract village       
 spectators, because of the lovely     
 setting and smashing teas. St Mawgan  
 C.C. play in 2 leagues and travel up  
 to 40 miles for away matches. At the  
 end of the year cups are awarded for  
 captains cup, clubmans cup, best      
 bowler, best fielder and best bats    
 man. You have to be born or live in   
 the parish to qualify to play, and    
 practices are held every Wednesday and
 Friday. Paul Lobb in a recent match   
 hit 205 to establish a new record     
 score for the club.
