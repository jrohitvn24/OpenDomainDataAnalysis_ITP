 rea, as well as, suppling the Milk    
Marketing Board. There is a boarding   
kennels for dogs and 3 horse studs.    
The population of Hargrave approx. 290 
has remained stable for many years with
very little new housing, consquently   
the population has become older and the
soical life of the village has declined
Knowles Green consists of 4 dwellings  
with no amenties, relying on Hargrave  
or Chevington for a shop, post office, 
church and school.                     
Conclusion: If villages are to survive 
a limited amount of new housing has to 
be allowed, either to replace condemned
properties or on newly aquired land but
care must be taken that the character  
of the village is not greatly changed  
and the amentities are adequate, for   
the increasing population. The nearest 
doctor is 5 miles away at Barrow.      </content>
