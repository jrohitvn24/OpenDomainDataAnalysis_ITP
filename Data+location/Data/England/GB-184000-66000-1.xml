		<title>01SUMMARY</title>
		<content> This is an area of outstanding natural
 beauty with a rugged coastline,well   
 known as a tourist attraction.There   
 are many beaches including Mawgan     
 Porth and Beacon Cove.There are also  
 inland walks along the Vale of        
 Lanherne following high hedged narrow 
 roads or across fields to St.Mawgan   
 village and Carnanton Woods.          
    The remains of an iron age cliff   
 castle can be seen on the cliffs south
 of Beacon Cove,but most of the more   
 modern buildings are along the coastal
 road .Much of the inland area is      
 farmland and residents are dependent  
 on nearby Newquay or St.Columb Major  
 for major services and transport is   
 vital for those living here.          
     The character of our area changes 
 dramatically from winter to summer    
 when the population is increased by   
 holiday makers.                       </content>
