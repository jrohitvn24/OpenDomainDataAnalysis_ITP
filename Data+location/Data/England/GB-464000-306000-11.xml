		<title>11Our playground games</title>
		<content> We live in Keyham.  We go to St.      
 Luke's School, Thurnby. At school we  
 play games like{Free Pod}and{British  
{Bulldog.}Free Pod is where one person 
 is{on.}They close their eyes and      
 count to 100 while the other people   
 playing go and hide. The person who   
 is on looks for the people hiding.    
 When he or she has found them they    
 have to run back to base before the   
 person who is on{pods}the base        
 (touches it and declares "pod ...."   
 whatever their name is).              
 British Bulldog is where a row of     
 children line up and someone is on in 
 front of them. He or she calls out a  
 name and that person has to run to the
 other side and avoid being caught. If 
 they are caught they are on as well!
