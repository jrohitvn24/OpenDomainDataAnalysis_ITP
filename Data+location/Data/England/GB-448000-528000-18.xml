		<content> centre and the industrial estate on   
 the{B1277}road brings many goods      
 vehicles.                             
   Traffic counts were carried out     
 along several of the main roads in the
 area and the results showed that the  
 two busiest were Catcote Road and     
 Stockton Road (the{A689}). On Catcote 
 Road the traffic was mainly cars,{266 
 in half an hour, while on Stockton    
 Road there was a higher proportion of 
 goods vehicles. The reason for this   
 difference is that Stockton Road      
 serves the industrial estate and the  
 shops of the town centre, while       
 Catcote Road is used as a through -   
 route to the northern part of the     
 town. Local roads, around the estates 
 had much less traffic, except for     
 Truro Drive, which is a link road     
 between Catcote Road and Stockton     
 Road.                                 </content>
