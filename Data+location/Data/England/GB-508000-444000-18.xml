		<title>18SHOPPING FACILITIES IN LEVEN</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
 In Leven we have 8 shops; these       
 include a bakery,a butchers, a        
 greengrocers, two general stores, a   
 clothes shop &amp; a shop selling         
 pottery,china &amp; glass ware.           
  I went out to ask ten ladies what    
 they thought about the shopping       
 facilities in Leven. I asked them what
 they thought about the shops in the   
 village some thought they were, poor  
 most of them thought that they were   
 allright.I asked them if they always  
 shopped in Leven, five said           
 sometimes.Then I asked them if they   
 shopped daily,weekly or monthly.Most  
 of them shopped weekly, they said they
 usually shopped at large stores like  
 Asda,Sainsburys,Presto,and British    
 Home Stores as they had a better      
 selection and more choice.            </content>
