{PLAYGROUND GAMES}-Children were       
 interviewed about which games they    
 played at playtime.The children tend  
 to play games which involve running   
 around and a few play traditional     
 games such as bulldog(a fast catch    
 game).Ball games are not allowed      
 due to limited space.                 
{TELEVISION INFLUENCE}-A lot of games  
 played were based on T.V. programmes  
 such as the'A-TEAM' or 'KNIGHTRIDER'  
 which are American cops and robbers   
 programmes.                           
{PLAYGROUND FURNITURE}-The wall bars in
 the playground provided a great number
 of uses from just climbing on to a    
 S.A.S. assault course or a DRAGON's   
 lair.
