		<content> Homes in the area are divided into 2  
 groups: rented and private. Some of   
 the houses are of historic interest   
 are listed as being of special note   
 .                                     
{RENTED ACCOMODATION}is both Council   
 owned and tied. Council homes are     
 semi_detached and have all the basic  
 amenities including inside toilets.   
 There are bungalows for young marrieds
 or elderly tenants. All have large    
 gardens. There are very few tied      
 cottages.                             
                                       
{PRIVATE HOMES}are very mixed in age   
 and style. They date from Tudor times 
 to the present although remaining     
 traditional in style. Virtually all   
 this housing stock is in a good state 
 of repair and has all the basic       
 amenities, though for some this is a  
 recent addition.                      </content>
