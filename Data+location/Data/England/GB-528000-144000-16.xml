 off the London to Brighton line into  
 the depot. On average 3 trains come in

 train. When full all trucks weigh 648 
 tonnes.There is 1 type of sand and 3  
 types of gravel both of which have    
 been dredged from the{seabed in       
{Norfolk.}The sand and gravel are      
 loaded onto lorries by a machine
