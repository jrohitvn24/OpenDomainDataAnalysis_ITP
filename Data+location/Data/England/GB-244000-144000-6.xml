		<title>06BULL POINT LIGHTHOUSE</title>
		<content>     Bull Point Lighthouse, just north 
 of Morte Point, was originally built  
 in 1879, to the dismay of the many    
 people of Mortehoe who relied on the  
 frequent wrecks along this            
 inhospitable coastline for extra      
 income.  In 1972, however, there was a
 landslide below the lighthouse, and   
 cracks appeared in the building.      
 A portable light from Crowe was       
 used until the new lighthouse was     
 completed in 1975, built higher up the
 cliffs, and incorporating many        
 automatic devices.  It was built by   
 local builders T.R.Yeo &amp; Sons, and was
 opened on 25th July 1975 by Captain   
 Tibbett, who arrived by helicopter.   
 The light is manned by a husband and  
 wife team, currently Mr &amp; Mrs Tom     
 Whiston.  The light flashes three     
 times every ten seconds.  The fog horn
 blasts every minute in poor visibility</content>
