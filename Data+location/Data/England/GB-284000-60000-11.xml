		<title>11Holiday Camp - Paignton</title>
		<content> We came into the camp and went to the 
 Reception. They gave us badges,       
 brochures and stickers.               
 We went to the children's playground  
 then to the ballroom to see the Donkey
 Derby.                                
{The Chef}                             
  Then we went to see the Chef         
 he told us that there are 760 people  
 fed at each sitting. There are three  
 meals per day and each meal offer a   
 choice of three or four courses. The  
 menu is changed every day and the chef
 has 22 helpers. The drinks are tea,   
 coffee and fruit juice.               
 The chef has to work 39 hours and has 
 to wear a chef's uniform all the time.
 He does not have time off between     
 meals but he enjoys his work.
