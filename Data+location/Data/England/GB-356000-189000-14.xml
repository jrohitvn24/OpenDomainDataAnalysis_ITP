 In Littleton Wharf we walked along a  
 path and came to a boat slipway. We   
 saw the Severn Bridge from the Severn 
 Barrier which is man-made. The Barrier
 which we were walking along was to    
 stop the Severn flooding the fields.  
 We also saw Oldbury Nuclear Power     
 Staton. In the fields we noticed      
 drainage ditches or rhines. There was 
 a bridge going across the drainage    
 ditch. As we walked we saw cracks in  
 the ground. When the river is at high 
 tide it makes the ground soggy which  
 causes cracks when it dries. Our      
 teacher pointed out that the River    
 Severn is the largest river in Great  
 Britain.
