		<content>Mother in kitchen doing a bit of       
knitting.In came a burglar and         
knocked her out.                       
                                       
What you have to do when they get to   
the bit that goes (in comes the        
burglar) another person jumps in and   
when they say (and knocks her out ) the
person goes out and you start again.   
                                       
I'm a tex,I'm a tex,I'm a texas girl.  
I live in the mountains far away.      
I can ride.I can shoot.I can swing a   
lasso.Where the cowboys meet in town.  
There's a guy over there and he winks  
one eye.He said that he loved me but he
told a lie.His hair don't curl and his 
shoes don't shine.He aint got the money
.So he aint mine.
