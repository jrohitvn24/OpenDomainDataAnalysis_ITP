		<title>18LOCAL NEWS-SUTTON ST JAMES</title>
		<content> Most local news items in the paper    
 deal with reports from the various    
 clubs and meetings in the village.    
 They are much the same type of reports
 that you would read  for any village  
 in any area. Sometimes, there are     
 stories which cause more of a stir.   
  There has been some heated discussion
 about the siting of a bus shelter     
 recently, with people having different
 ideas as to where it should be put.   
 Another important piece of news is the
 current price for potatoes,beet and   
 strawberries. This always is very much
 discussed so people can decide what   
 to grow next year, or what not to     
 grow.                                 
 Another very useful way of finding    
 things out is to get the parish       
 magazine.
