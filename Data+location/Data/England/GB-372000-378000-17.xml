		<title>17HOSPITALS IN KNUTSFORD</title>
		<content>   In Knutsford there were two         
 hospitals and quite alot of old       
 peoples homes. The cottage hospital   
 has recently closed down but Cranford 
 Lodge hospital still remains.  There  
 was a workhouse on the site before    
 Cranford.  One lady has been in the   
 hospital since the age of four and she
 is now seventy eight.There are four   
 wards in Cranford. Cranford looks     
 after old people, mainly women. The   
 hospital has fifty four beds,ten for  
 the G.P..  Shifts are eight hours and 
 twelve hours at night.One of the      
 nurses said "You have to enjoy the job
 to be good at it".  There is a        
 section in the hospital where old     
 people can come in and do things like 
 make wicker baskets (occupational     
 therapy). People come in to exercise  
 and enjoy themselves.
