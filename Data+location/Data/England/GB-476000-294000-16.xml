		<title>16HALLATON: MAY DAY AND PUBS</title>
		<content>  On May Day Bank Holiday the tradition
 of{crowning the May Queen}is carried  
 on, organised by the Guides. A cart or
 decorated van leaves the Stenning Hall
 with the May Queen and her attendants 
 (children from the village school)    
 behind a guard of honour of guides.   
 They make their way to the Butter     
 Cross where the May Queen is crowned. 
 Then follows a fancy dress contest for
 the children, tea in the Stenning Hall
 and a sale.                           
 --------------------------------------
  There are three pubs in Hallaton: the
{Bewicke Arms,}named after an old local
 family; the{Fox}by the duckpond; and  
 the{Old Royal Oak}in the High Street. 
 All are frequented by locals, but the 
 Oak is popular with darts players and 
 the Bewicke, picturesque with thatched
 roof and beams, attracts more         
 outsiders, particularly in the Summer.</content>
