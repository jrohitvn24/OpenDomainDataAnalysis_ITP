		<title>09THE CHURCHILL NEWSLETTER</title>
		<content>  "Roundabout", the village news sheet 
 first appeared in February 1970.      
 Written and duplicated on a           
 hand-operated duplicator by the       
 village schoolteacher and distributed 
 by her to every householder, she      
 wrote that she would produce two more 
 issues, and if the village liked it,  
 they should raise the money to        
 continue publication.   This they have
 done ever since.                      
  Today, the editor writes the copy;   
 it is typed onto a stencil by another 
 villager;  it is taken into Chipping  
 Norton's Primary School to be         
 duplicated, and is then distributed by
 seven people to every house in        
 Churchill, Sarsden and Merriscourt,   
 with twenty-five copies going by post 
 to outlying parishioners.   It is free
 and appears ten times a year.
