		<title>19CALDERSTONES - A PUBLIC PARK</title>
		<content>  Calderstones is a large and beautiful
 public park taking it's name from some
{ancient standing stones,}strangely    
 marked, that were found nearby. They  
 can now be seen in one of the park's  
 greenhouses. As you stroll through the
 park on a sunny Sunday afternoon with 
 others walking off their lunch you    
 will see fine landscaping with many   
 different varieties of trees, a large,
 ornamental lake complete with ducks   
 and people fishing, little streams    
 passing under quaint rustic bridges, a
 beautifully styled Japanese garden    
 complete with miniature trees and a   
 bamboo deer scarer, a traditional     
 English walled garden changing with   
 the seasons, and roses galore. In one 
 greenhouse, as you walk through a     
 dripping jungle glade, you spot rare  
 orchids of all kinds. For peace and   
 quiet there is no finer place.        </content>
