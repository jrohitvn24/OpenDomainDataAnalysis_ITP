{By Robert Murch and Simon Dibble.     
 On Tuesday week Adam Robert and       
 Simon D. went to the building site to 
 ask Dave Peters some questions about  
 the Village Football team he said     
 that they had won the second division 
 cup and lots of others.               
    The Football team has been going   
 for 14 years. Some of their team have 
 been seriously hurt with broken       
 legs.Some of their players come from  
 South Molton and further away in other
 Villages.The teams fastest player is  
 Martin Bendo.                         
     The team is sponsored by Simple   
 Simon Pasties,as one of the players   
 works for the firm. They voted to have
 a new kit. And that was all!
