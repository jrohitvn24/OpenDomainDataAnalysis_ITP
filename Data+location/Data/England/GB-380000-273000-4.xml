		<content> I get up and go outside. We have a    
 large playground where we can play    
 games. I go to the shops across the   
 road; we have a Cooperative Society, a
 Betting Shop, Fish and Chip Shop, a   
 Hairdresser's, a Post                 
 Office/Newsagent's and an Off-Licence 
 which opens from 6.00 till 10.30 p.m. 
 Nearby there is a recreation ground   
 called Brinton's Park, donated by the 
 Brinton family, who own large carpet  
 factories in the town. In the park    
 there is a paddling pool, a football  
 pitch and a Bowling Green.            
 On Sutton Farm Estate we have a       
 resident's association which takes us 
 on day trips.                         
 During the evening, at certain times  
 of the year I am able to go to the    
 travelling fair which stays at        
 Worcester Road traffic island.
