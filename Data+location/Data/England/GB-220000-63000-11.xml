		<title>11LEISURE IN THE DOBWALLS AREA</title>
		<content>   PEOPLE PURSUE A WIDE RANGE OF       
 LEISURE ACTIVITIES. ORGANISED         
 ACTIVITIES CAN BE FOUND MAINLY OUTSIDE
 THE BLOCK, IN LISKEARD, PLYMOUTH OR   
 ST.AUSTELL. IF YOU TRAVEL THEN YOU CAN
 ENJOY ANY SORT OF ENTERTAINMENT OR    
 SPORT. IF NOT THEN YOU HAVE TO BE MORE
 SELF RELIANT.                         
  THERE IS A FOOTBALL CLUB IN DOBWALLS,
 A BADMINTON CLUB (WITH MANY MEMBERS   
 COMING FROM OUTSIDE THE BLOCK), AND 2 
 SNOOKER CLUBS. THERE IS A GARDENING   
 CLUB AT ST.PINNOCK.                   
   BOTH CHURCH AND CHAPEL FULFIL THE   
 NEEDS OF SOME ADHERENTS AS AN         
 ENJOYABLE ACTIVITY APART FROM WORK.   
 OTHERS ARE ACTIVE POLITICALLY. OTHERS 
 FIND SATISFACTION IN WORKING ON THEIR 
 HOUSES OR CARS.                       
  THERE IS ONLY 1 PUB IN THE BLOCK.    
 OCCASIONALLY DANCES TAKE PLACE IN THE 
 MEMORIAL HALL.                        </content>
