		<content>   In the Attercliffe and Darnall area 
 there are up to 50 families of Gypsies
{(travellers)}at any one time.There is 
 an official site in the Lodge Moor    
 area of Sheffield, but most prefer to 
 stay on unofficial sites in           
 Attercliffe where they can more easily
 carry on there scrap metal trading.   
   Their accomodation ranges from very 
 luxurious to spartan caravans with no 
 proper beds. Because of the decline of
 local industry and a reduced demand   
 for scrap metal many travellers have  
 to live on{State benefits.            
   Some still deal in horses which are 
 regarded as status symbols. Many of   
 the children attend{Phillimore Park   
{School}where there is a social worker 
 looking after the travallers welfare  
 and who encourages parents to keep    
 their children at school permanently.
