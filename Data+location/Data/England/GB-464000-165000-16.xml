		<title>16INDOOR GAMES IN BURGHFIELD</title>
		<content> Despite many activities in the village
 ,some children prefer to stay indoors.
 Here are some games played by a pupil 
 at Garland Junior School.             
  "'Snakes and Ladders'is a popular    
 game in which there is a board with   
 100 squares.Drawn on it are snakes and
 ladders,each linking two squares.You  
 throw a dice and if you land at the   
 bottom of a ladder,you go to a higher 
 number,but if you land on a snake,you 
 go down.The winner is the first to    
 reach 100.                            
  "A game I play on my computer is cal-
 led 'Race'.The player is on a pink    
 motorbike,and has to dodge lots of on-
 coming blue cars.If you get hit you   
 lose.                                 
  "'Snap'is a game using ordinary play-
 ing cards or special cards.As you put 
 the cards down,you shout 'snap!'if you
 see two cards the same."              </content>
