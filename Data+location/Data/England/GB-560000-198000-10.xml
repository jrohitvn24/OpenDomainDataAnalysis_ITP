		<content>    We invited Mr.D. Acland along to   
 give a talk to our 4th year on plants 
 and birds in our area. He was very    
 enthusiastic about the subject and    
 gave us some tips on how to go about  
 our research.                         
    Guide books are essential and try  
 to do your homework first. Trees and  
 flowers can be compared with pictures 
 and writing by looking at leaves,     
 flowers, fruit, bark etc. Birds are   
 more difficult, so you must act like a
 detective by asking questions and     
 eliminating suspects. Some things to  
 consider are :                        
  (a) size         (b) shape           
  (c) behaviour    (d) flight          
  (e) markings     (f) call/song       
  (g) habitat      (h) time of year    
 Never be afraid to say "I don't know" 
 and take notes.{Do not harm the       
{wildlife or the countryside.}         </content>
