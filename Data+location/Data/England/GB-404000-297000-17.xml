		<title>17Central Heating in Streetly</title>
		<content> In our class there were quite a lot of
 people with central heating (23). l7  
 people had gas fires which is more    
 than I expected. I only expected about
 10. 5 people had electric fires which 
 was less than I thought. Not many     
 people had moveable gas fires. There  
 were 4. Nobody in the class has got an
 open fire, I didn't really expect they
 would. So more people had central     
 heating because it is the newest idea.
 Nobody has an open fire because the   
 coal is too much money. You would also
 have to employ a chimney sweep once a 
 year to sweep the chimney. People in  
 the country use logs from fallen trees
 for their heating. People in the      
 mining areas use coal for their       
 heating. {by Simon Miller
