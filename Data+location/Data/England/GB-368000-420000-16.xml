		<title>16India Mill Chimney</title>
		<content> The old square stacks of the          
 Lancashire cotton towns were          
 associated with dark satanic mills but
 this certainly could not be said of   
 India Mill Chimney,one of Darwen's    
 most prominant land marks.            
 The chimney took 4 years to build     
 being finished in 1867.It is built in 
 the style of a Venetian bell tower &amp;  
 the cost was Â£14,000.The foundation   
 stone was a solid piece of            
 ashlar,which was pulled to its resting
 place by a team of 30 horses.On this  
 foundation was built a 14 metre       
 high,square,stone pedestal with       
 massive 12 metre long stone           
 cornices.The chimney shaft was 8 metre
 square &amp; was raised to a height of 85 
 metres above ground level.During World
 War 2 the ornamental iron cresting    
 was removed for scrap.It weighed 20   
 tons &amp; was made up of 30 castings.    </content>
