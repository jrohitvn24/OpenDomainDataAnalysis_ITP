		<content>In Wilbarston there is a distribution  
factory called Fosters Original Foods. 
The Foster family moved here over 11   
years ago.They chose the Midlands area 
because of its central location.They do
not produce their own products,but re- 
pack foods with their own label,such as
biscuits,cakes,crisps,sweets and whole 
meal cereals.The business started with 
Mr Foster and one other person selling 
biscuits to 10 outlets.It has expanded 
to 10 employees with a variety of new  
products.Crisps are very popular.      
Seasonal cereals sell to 1,200 outlets 
in East Anglia,Southampton and the Isle
of Wight.                              
Today they have 3 lorries, 2 vans and  
one vintage van for advertising.
