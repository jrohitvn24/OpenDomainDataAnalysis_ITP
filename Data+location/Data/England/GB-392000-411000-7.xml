   Many of the oldest houses in the    
 area are{weavers cottages}like the    
 ones near Dale Mill on Dale Street.   
 These properties are three storeys    
 high and originally the top floor was 
 used for weaving. These old houses are
 built from sandstone taken from       
 quarries in the local area. Their     
 roofs are also made of stone.         
   The houses built in the last 30     
 years generally have garages, gardens 
 and more rooms than the older         
 properties. Earlier this year gas was 
 laid on to the Pennine Drive estate.
