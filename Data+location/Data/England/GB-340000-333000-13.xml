		<content> The garage was established in 1924.It 
 has always been run by the same       
 family.There are 4 people employed.   
 There is 1 from Welshampton,2 from Wem
 and 1 from Ellesmere.There are        
 repairs made to cars and agricultural 
 vehicles.                             
 The opening hours are -week days 8    
 a.m.until 6 p.m. and  Sunday 10 a.m.  
 until 1 p.m.They only sell petrol     
 not diesel oil.                       
 There is other work carried out from  
 the garage including electrical and   
 water installations.The work has      
 changed because cars ,machinery and   
 the tools to repair them have improved
 over the years.                       
 Egerton's garage started to operate   
 the school mini bus service in 1970.
