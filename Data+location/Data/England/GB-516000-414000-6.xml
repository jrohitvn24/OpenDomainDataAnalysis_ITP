		<title>06Kennedy Way, Immingham</title>
		<content> Kennedy Way is situated on Pelham     
 Road in the centre of Immingham. By   
 the everyday visitors it is commonly  
 known as "The Precinct" or "The       
 Civic".                               
 We asked some people if they regularly
 visited the sports centre which is but
 a few seconds walk from the Civic. Out
 of some 50 people only about 10       
 visited regularly.Although this result
 surprised us a little, all the people 
 we asked were adults who were either  
 too busy or not sporty!               
 At one end of the Precinct there is   
 at present an empty unit so we asked  
 the shoppers what they would like to  
 see there.They replied:a boys' clothes
 shop, book shop, record shop, antique 
 shop or the most popular choice of    
 all; a cafe.
