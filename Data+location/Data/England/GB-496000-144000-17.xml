		<title>17Migration to Godalming</title>
		<content> The average number of years people had
 lived in Godalming was twelve. Most   
 people moved here because of easy     
 access to the place of work of the    
 main wage earner. The second reason   
 was that the people much preferred to 
 live in this area even though the vast
 majority of them came from other parts
 of Surrey. They preferred the quieter,
 rural atmosphere, the friendliness and
 the close proximity of London and the 
 south coast. Those few who did not    
 like living in this area missed their 
 friends. People also think this area  
 is very convenient for both Heathrow  
 and Gatwick airports. Some said more  
 shopping facilities and car parks were
 needed.
