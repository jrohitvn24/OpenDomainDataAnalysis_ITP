		<title>11LOCAL HISTORY -BUTTERTON.</title>
		<content>We went on a tour of the village with  
Mr Myatt.The village has 50 houses,    
1O0 inhabitants, 10 children, 12 dogs  
and 9 cats. The oldest house is        
Millstone cottage; it used to be the   
rectory.In the village street there is 
the old school. The school and the     
cottage next door share the same       
dividing wall. The village green is    
rather long. It used to have the       
village hall on it. Opposite the school
 the "spout". No longer is the water   
drinkable. The village pond was empty, 
but the V.R.postbox was newly painted. 
We went through the gateway of old     
Butterton park, past Lodge Cottage,and 
Butterton House. We saw the ruins of   
Butterton Hall. We walked through a    
field of Barley and Thistle. The church
wood had a trail of Bluebells.We saw   
the quarry with signs of sandstone and 
igneous rocks. Then back to the church </content>
