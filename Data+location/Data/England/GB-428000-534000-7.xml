		<title>07HETT VILLAGE 2</title>
		<content> From our survey we discovered that    
 much of the village was built over    
 a 100 years ago around the very large 
 green.                                
                                       
 The green is nearly half a km long    
 and 100m wide with a{duck pond}at one 
 end.Unfortunately the bad winter and  
 ice meant a fox removed all the ducks 
 in January and February.A lady told   
 us she was really quite pleased       
 because the ducks woke her up at 5.am 
 every morning in the Summer.          
                                       
 At the other end of the green is a    
 group of very modern Georgian style   
 houses with an old tin Village Hall   
 near them.                            
                                       
 In winter the village is often cut off
 by heavy snowdrifts for a day or two. 
 the drifts are cleared by the farmers </content>
