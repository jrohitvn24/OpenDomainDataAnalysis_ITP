		<content> 1 Today there are only two classes,   
 infants and juniors. The Headteacher  
 is Mrs Paul and she teaches the       
 juniors. There are three classrooms   
 and the third one is used for         
 television, singing, assembly and     
 woodwork.                             
  The school secretary is Mrs Beck and 
 she comes to work in the office every 
 morning.Our dinners are delivered from
 Aylesham Secondary School. Only four  
 children have school dinners, the rest
 either go home or bring packed        
 lunches. Mr. Ian Hawkins, our vicar   
 ,comes into school every week to take 
 assembly.                             
  The school has two playing fields and
 a swimming pool.We have two guinea    
 pigs which are very friendly.Children 
 take it in turns to take the guinea   
 pigs home during the holidays.
