		<title>14A day in the life of Andrew</title>
		<content> I get up at 7.00am, I wake up by      
 myself.I then get myself dressed for  
 school,I wear grey trousers, black    
 shoes, coloured socks,a vest, a white 
 shirt and a grey jumper.I go down to  
 breakfast at 7.20 and eat my cereals. 
 After this I go back upstairs and     
 clean my teeth.We leave for school at 
 8.30. At Chelsfield Primary there are 
 three classes; I am in class 3.After  
 8.55 we go into our classes and my    
 teacher calls the register and I start
 my handwriting and other lessons. At  
 10.10 we all go into assembly and talk
 about things around us. After this we 
 have a short break before starting    
 lessons again, I play marbles.At 12.00
 it is lunchtime. I have a hot dog,    
 crisps, tea and biscuits.For the rest 
 of the afternoon we work or have P.E. 
 When I get home I practice my guitar, 
 have tea and go to bed at 8.00pm.     </content>
