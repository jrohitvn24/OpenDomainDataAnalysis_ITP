		<content>Rev.Stuart enjoys his job very much.His
main concerns are to finish the        
restoration and trying to get more     
people to attend church.He does not    
help with the Sunday School because the
church services are held at the same   
time.The services that are held in     
church are 8.30 (the 1662 service)     
and 9.30 and 11.00 are new services,   
and also at Charney Bassett he holds   
the Evensong.                          
The earliest parts of St Marys church  
date from the early part of the 13th   
century.Towards the end of the same    
century the pillars on the south side  
were replaced.At the same time a third 
bay was added to the nave westward,and 
the present chancel was built.The      
S.side was added in the 14th century,  
the tower &amp; porch in the 15th and the  
North aisle and vestry in the 17th     
century.                               </content>
