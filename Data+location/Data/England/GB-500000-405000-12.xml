 At Smith Parkinson's garage they      
 start work at 8.3O a.m.  First of all 
 the garage floor and benches are swept
 and tidied.  The Service Manager, Mr  
 Parkinson, comes into the garage and  
 tells the workmen what work to do.    
 The qualified mechanics do the main   
 jobs such as repairing and replacing  
 engines, mending bodywork on crashed  
 cars and doing Ministry of Transport  
 tests known as M.O.T. for all cars    
 three years old and over.  Meanwhile  
 the boys on the Youth Training Scheme 
 check oil, water and tyres.  This is  
 called servicing.  They also polish   
 the cars before they are sent back to 
 the owners if the cars are quite new. 
 They finish work at 5.3O p.m.
