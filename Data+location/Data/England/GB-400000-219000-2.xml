 Mr.Robert Gillet is the present tenant
 in Heylans Farm.The farm is a mixed   
 farm with arable and beef stock.It is 
 160 acres in size with nine           
 buildings.He needs alot of patience to
 farm his land.The average cost of     
 running the arable part is from 12 to 
 14 thousand pounds a year.In the      
 summer the average working hours are  
 from twelve to seventeen hours a      
 day.e.g.Mr.Gillet was up from         
 5a.m.until 9p.m.the day before we     
 interviewed him.He then went to the   
 Royal Oak pub.                        
    He does not like spraying because  
 the chemicals are expensive.There are 
 4 working dogs but most of the work is
 done by tractors.                     
    He was brought up on a farm and has
 had no vandals on his.He plays bowls  
 in Cheltenham in his spare time.      </content>
