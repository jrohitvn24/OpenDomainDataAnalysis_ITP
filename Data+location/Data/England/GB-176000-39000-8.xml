		<title>08CARNON VALLEY RESTORATION</title>
		<content> The  valley  has  been an  eyesore for
 many years  due to the  activities  of
 tin streamers in the past.            
 A few years ago, in 1980,  Carnon Con-
 solidated  Limited  became the  owners
 of the valley and decided to test  the
 deposits to see if  any of the remain-
 ing tin could be profitably recovered.
 As there was  only  one small  section
 near  the Devoran  end  of the  valley
 worth recovering,  the company decided
 it was about time to restore  the rest
 of the  valley up to Bissoe to make it
 green and pleasant again.             
 Work has  started  with the  holes and
 ponds being  bulldozed  and  the rough
 land smoothed over. Much of it will be
 sown with grass seed and lots of trees
 and bushes planted.                   
 There will be asphalt paths for use by
 the elderly and disabled.             
 Work should be completed by 1989.     </content>
