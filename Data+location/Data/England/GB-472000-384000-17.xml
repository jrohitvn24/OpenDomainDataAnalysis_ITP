		<title>17A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> WHEN WE WERE INSIDE MY TEACHER TOLD US
 TO DO SOME MATHS WHICH HE HAD WRITTEN 
 ON THE BOARD. WE HAD TO DO THIS WITH  
 PARTNERS. MY PARTNER WAS DEBBIE. WE   
 WENT OUT TO PLAY AT 2.15. AFTER PLAY  
 WE HAD TO CARRY ON WITH THE MATHS     
 UNTIL IT WAS TIME TO GO HOME.AT 3.15  
 WE CLEARED OUR DESKS,PUT OUR CHAIRS UP
 ON THE DESKS AND SAID PRAYERS. WE THEN
 PUT OUR COATS ON AND WENT OUTSIDE TO  
 CATCH THE BUS.WHEN IT GOT TO BOLE (MY 
 VILLAGE)I GOT OFF AND STARTED WALKING 
 TO MY HOUSE.                          
 WHEN I GOT HOME I WENT TO PLAY WITH   
 DEBBIE UNTIL TEA TIME. AFTER TEA I    
 WENT TO PLAY WITH SARAH. I STOPPED    
 PLAYING WITH SARAH AT 7.00. I WENT    
 HOME AND HAD A BATH. I WENT TO BED AT 
 8.00 AND READ UNTIL 9.00 WHEN I WENT  
 TO SLEEP.                             
                                       
                                       </content>
