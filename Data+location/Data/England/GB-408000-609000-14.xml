		<content> There is a small attractive camping   
 site at Cherry tree farm, with pitches
 for 25 tents beside the river. Charges
 are #3 per night and the site is open 
 between April and October. Facilities 
 provided are limited, i.e. toilets and
 cold water only; however the majority 
 of the visitors here prefer a simple  
 site. Holiday makers come from this   
 country and abroad; during the day    
 they tour the countryside or go to the
 beach, returning in the evenings to   
 the peace of the site.                
 Planning regulations stipulate only   
 tents on this site, but the Caravan   
 Act on 1960 does permit touring vans  
 for overnight stops. Caravans however 
 are rarely seen at the site. The type 
 of tents on site range from small     
 hiking tents used by walkers and      
 cyclists to the large modern bungalow 
 tents, used by families.              </content>
