		<content> I go to Gillian Tusan dancing club    
 every Tuesday. We have to take Ballet 
 and Tap shoes and a leotard. If you do
 gym , modern,tap and ballet it would  
 cost about Â£24 for about six or seven 
 weeks. Every six or seven weeks, we   
 have been we have got another bill to 
 pay. Our teachers name is Gillian     
 Tusan,but we call her Mrs Tusan. I    
 have got six medals for ballet and gym
 and about eleven certificates for gym,
 ballet,tap and modern. I like playing 
 squash with my brother. It is played  
 in a room with four walls. First of   
 all you take the feel of the bat. When
 one person hits the ball against the  
 wall you have to do the same. If you  
 obstruct the other person from hitting
 the ball it is a point to them.
