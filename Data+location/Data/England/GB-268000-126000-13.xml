		<title>13My house (1)</title>
		<content>  The house I live in is detached. I   
 think it is owner occupied. Upstairs  
 there are four bedrooms, an airing    
 cupboard and one bathroom. Downstairs 
 there is one toilet, a kitchen, one   
 small cupboard which is used to store 
 brooms dustpan and brush etc. and a   
 dining room. We have a fairly big     
 dining room. We use one half of the   
 dining room where the computer is kept
 and all the accessories for it. The   
 other half is where the T.V.is kept   
 and the three piece suite. We have a  
 garage with a yellow door. We also    
 have two gardens- a front garden and  
 a back garden which each have flowers 
 growing there and we have a tiny      
 garden where the rabbits are kept. We 
 also have a shed, a green house and a 
 pond. The pond has a fountain and fish
 in there. THAT'S MY HOUSE.
