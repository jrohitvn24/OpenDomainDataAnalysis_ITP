		<title>19UNITED REFORM CHURCH STROUD</title>
		<content>    {Rodborough Tabernacle United      
{Reform Church                         
{  }It stands at the junction of       
 Tabernacle Pitch and Tabernacle Walk  
 near Rodborough Common.The building is
 of local stone overlooking the        
 valley.Inside there are many          
 interesting features for the          
 visitor.One is the strangely named    
 Treacle Bible,a precious possession,as
 it is a l538 first translation        
 edition.No-one is at present quite    
 sure how the Tabernacle acquired it   
 but it can be found displayed in a    
 glass case.It apparently is not       
 perfect with one fault inside.The     
 Tabernacle often had visiting         
 preachers as well as the incumbents.  
 The famous preacher,George Whitefield,
 travelled from Bristol for Evangelical
 meetings.Today it is also used for    
 playgroups,brownies and drama.        </content>
