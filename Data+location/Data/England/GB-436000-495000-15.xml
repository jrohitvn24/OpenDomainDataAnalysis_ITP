		<content> Brompton was a Saxon settlement.In    
 1086 Brinton,then Brumpton(Broom farm)
 until the C19th.,was held by the      
 Bishops of Durham,but 'laid to waste'.
 St.Thomas's Church is over 1000 years 
 old &amp; became a Parish Church in 1843. 
 Rare Viking hogback gravestones &amp;     
 Saxon crosses were found during the   
 extensive Victorian restoration of the
 church.In 1138 the Battle of the      
 Standard took place in the parish.John
 Kettlewell left a Trust in 1695 from  
 which local scholars,sick &amp; needy     
 still benefit.The Whitsuntide Fair is 
 still held on High Green.The railway  
 brought crowds from Teesside to enjoy 
 boating on the dammed up beck at Water
 End.Although an agricultural          
 village,the railway's arrival in 1846 
 encouraged a thriving linen industry  
 for the next 100 years.
