		<title>04STREET END FORGE AND AREA</title>
		<content> The forge is a timber framed building 
 with some flint stone walls and a roof
 of Kent Peg Tiles. Although it has not
 been used for horse-shoeing since 1962
 there is evidence that it was in      
 existence before 1787. One man still  
 works here, carrying out repairs and  
 making items in wrought iron and      
 steel. Behind the forge is a builders'
 yard and carpenters' shop, used in the
 early 19th century by the wheelwright.
 Nearby is a coin operated telephone   
 box, a seat and bus stop with glass-  
 framed timetable. Operated by the East
 Kent Bus Company, a limited service   
 runs to Canterbury, Folkestone, Hythe 
 or Waltham. At the same junction is a 
 stone sign marking a Bridleway. These 
 stones are erected by the Highways    
 Authorities and local interested      
 Groups to mark the Public Rights of   
 Way.                                  </content>
