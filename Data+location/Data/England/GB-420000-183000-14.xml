		<title>14A FAMOUS PERSON</title>
		<content> he has been on tv recently.           
 He has joined up with someone called  
 Peter Blegplant to make a record but I
 do not know what it was called.If the 
 group is doing something and they get 
 an invatation to play with another    
 group they do not go in for it because
 the group comes first.                
 we asked him how famous he would like 
 to be and he said as famous as        
 possible.                             
 His longest tour was 10 weeks which   
 was in America in 1979.He went to     
 Yugaslavia a bit shorter than 10      
 weeks.                                
 His last concert was in 1982 but he is
 still playing and making records.The  
 last N0.1 he had was in New Zealand   
 just before he left.
