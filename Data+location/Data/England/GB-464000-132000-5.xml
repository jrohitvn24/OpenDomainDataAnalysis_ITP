		<content> B M X:  A BMX is a stunt bike and     
 it has a triangular frame with V      
 shaped handle bars, 2 wheels,         
 pedals, chain, front and back brake,  
 and pads.  At the recreation ground   
 there is going to be a BMX track.  It 
 will be open all day, 7 days a week   
 and will be used by all ages. Young   
 children must be supervised.  Children
 will be riding at their own risk.  You
 must keep the pads on your bike for   
 safety.  It is important that you     
 should wear arm and knee pads but most
 important you should wear a helmet.   
 The bikes should be well looked after.
 Maintenance of the track is done by   
 volunteers.                           
      There are many stunts you can do 
 on a BMX including "Endo", "Wheelie"  
 and "American Bunny Hops" (a bit of   
 the first two stunts put together).
