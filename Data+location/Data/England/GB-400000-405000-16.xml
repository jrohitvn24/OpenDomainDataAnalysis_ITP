		<content> The annual rushcart festival is a     
 popular event. In the 19th century    
 local villages each built their own   
 rushcarts &amp; paraded them round, but   
 today there is only one which is      
 dragged around all the local villages 
 by teams of Morris Dancers.It ends up 
 at Saddleworth Church, where rushes   
 are taken in to the church during the 
 service, &amp; afterwards there is much   
 celebrating, drinking &amp; dancing. There
 is also a well-dressing outside the   
 church. Whit Friday Walks are a more  
 solemn affair. Wakes holidays are     
 still taken, with local businesses,   
 schools, etc. closing down for 2      
 weeks, &amp; also for the traditional     
 'September Week'. Morris dancing &amp;    
 clog dancing are popular, with clogs  
 being made loacally. Brass bands are  
 still thriving here. Fell races take  
 place over the hills for the active!  </content>
