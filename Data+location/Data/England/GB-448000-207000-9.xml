		<title>09 The Red Cross,Oxford</title>
		<content>  The Red Cross is a voluntary         
organisation to help people in         
distress, especially in wars. Every    
town in Great Britain has a Red Cross  
organisation with the biggest one in   
London. In Oxford, the meetings are    
held at 101 Banbury Road.              
  The Red Cross help in accidents or   
fires. They drive ambulances and run   
clubs for handicapped and old people.  
They also run old peoples' homes.      
  Once a year, they take big parties of
handicapped people on holiday to places
like Butlins, because they have chalets
and no stairs. The people love the     
holidays even if it is raining. There  
are also outings.                      
  Members of the Red Cross who do First
Aid have to take exams in nursing.     
 In times of war the Red Cross helps   
all countries because it is neutral.It 
also looks for missing persons.        </content>
