		<content> The village carnival held on August   
 Bank Holiday Monday is the one event  
 which brings the  whole village alive 
 .The procession is usually three      
 quarters of a mile long.It is led by  
 the village Band followed by the      
 Carnival Queen and her attendants ,   
 Jazz bands,marching bands ,decorated  
 floats and walkers .Every year new    
 ideas are presented in the floats and 
 great care is taken by the villagers  
 to avoid repetition of any idea that  
 has already been used in a previous   
 year.This usually sleepy village      
 becomes alive with thousands of people
 gathered to watch this annual event.  
 The parade winds its way around the   
 village and into the sports field .The
 Queen and attendants take their place 
 on stage for the announcement of the  
 prize  winners and the official       
 opening of the fete.                  </content>
