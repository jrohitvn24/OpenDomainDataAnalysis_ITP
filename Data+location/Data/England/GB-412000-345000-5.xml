		<title>05Closing of Stanton School</title>
		<content>{Stanton School} finally closed with 23
pupils on 22nd July 1983 after being in
use for 116 years.It was like many     
small rural schools in Staffordshire,  
falling rolls made it uneconomic.      
Most of the children transferred to    
Henry Prince First School in Mayfield  
taken there by taxi each morning and   
return to Stanton later in the day.    
The first news of the closure came in  
 ctober 1981. Despite pressure during  
the following year from the local      
M.P., School Managers and Parents the  
closure was confirmed on 14th April    
1983. An Open Evening was held on July 
1983. Many old pupils attended and were
treated to a wonderful display of past 
a present school work along with many  
old photographs and souvenirs of a much
valued place of education.
