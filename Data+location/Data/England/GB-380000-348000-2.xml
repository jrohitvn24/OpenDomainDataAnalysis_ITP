		<title>02Chesterton - the village</title>
		<content>Once  just  a  small mining village, it
has been much changed this century with
the building of three  housing estates.
The largest of these  sprawls down  the
Crackley Bank (the local word for hill)
to the north of the old village centre.
The Crackley estate is  mainly council-
owned property,  although  some of  the
houses  belong  to  the  National  Coal
Board.   An older council estate to the
south east of  the village  has  a more
pleasant aspect, and to the  south west
a private housing estate is still being
added to.   Between  these  three  lies
the old heart of  Chesterton,  a ribbon
development  along  the  "London Road",
once a busy  salt  waggon  and coaching
route  between  Chester and  the south.
Here typical  miners'  cottages  dating
from the turn of the century may  still
be seen.
