		<content> We conducted a survey of our class    
 (average age 13-14 years) to see what 
 people liked to do with their free    
 time. The results were taken and put  
 into a table and the following        
 conclusions were drawn. The           
 most'popular' pasttime was watching   
 television ; all but one of the class 
 watched some telvision every day.     
 Sport of varying kinds was also a     
 favourite activity, FOOTBALL,TENNIS,  
 SHOOTING, ATHLETICS, &amp; CRICKET being  
 the most popular. Reading for pleasure
 was well supported. Many of the other 
 top pastimes tended to be either      
 directly or indirectly connected with 
 "HIGH TECH" eg video films and        
 computer games. Pop music &amp; related   
 social activities such as discos and  
 youth clubs were popular,especially   
 with girls. Unusual items where rubber
 collecting and coin games.            </content>
