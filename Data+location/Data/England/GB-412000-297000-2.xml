All residents were affected when the   
West Midlands Metropolitan Coucil      
increased rates by 43% this year. Many 
home owners are already struggling to  
meet high monthly mortgage repayments  
determined by the high price of        
property in the area and can ill afford
this substantial increase in the rates.
Businesses too have felt the strain of 
this increase as it does nothing to    
encourage their expansion or thoughts  
of enlarging their work forces.        
The rate increase is the subject of    
great local concern in 1985.
