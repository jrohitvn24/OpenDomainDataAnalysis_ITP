		<content>     Potton Wood has been designated as
 an area of SSI (Special Scientific    
 Interest) by the Nature Conservancy   
 Council since it contains a variety of
 rare forms of plant life and is a     
 remnant of an ancient deciduous       
 woodland. Its most unusual flower is  
 an{Oxlip}(Primula Elatior) but it also
 has a wide variety of wild orchids    
 including the{Birds Nest}and{         
{Twayblade.}A quite remarkable variety 
 of birdlife can be seen in the wood   
 too.                                  
     The wood is arranged in three     
 sections each distinguished by its    
 tree life.
