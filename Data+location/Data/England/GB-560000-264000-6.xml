		<content>  Exning is a large village two miles  
North West of Newmarket.It contains    
several small village shops.           
  The sort of shops that were in Exning
around the date 1844 are not that      
different to those that are still      
around now.There are still the local   
shops like the post office,bakers      
and coalmerchants, all of which are    
still used. There are some shops that  
can not be found in Exning like the    
Wheel makers and tailor's. Other shops 
that could be found in Exning in the   
year 1844 but are not found today      
are ...... A Blacksmith and Carpenters.
There was a market in Exning but the   
traders moved to Newmarket, because    
Newmarket was on the main road,and more
people passed through Newmarket than   
Exning, so the market did more trade.
