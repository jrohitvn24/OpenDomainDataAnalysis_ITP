		<title>16Collecting Toy Soldiers.</title>
		<content> I started collecting soldiers in 1984.
 This started when my Grandmar came    
 overfrom Austrailia.When she arrived  
 she took us to the shops,we had a look
 around and l chose an army vehicle and
 seven German soldiers and my brother  
 chose seven British soldiers they cost
 twenty pence each.Then everyone went  
 to the shop later and we bought four  
 soldiers.Soon Jamie my brother stopped
 collecting soldiers and he gave his   
 soldiers to me.I discovered a         
 different shop in crewe called        
 poundstrechers.The soldiers were      
 cheaper but they were plastic.They    
 were better though because they had   
 jeeps,tanks,cannons and ambulances.   
 They cost fifty pence per bag each bag
 contains about twenty soilders.Then my
 dad built me a fort out of wood and l 
 play with my solders in it.
