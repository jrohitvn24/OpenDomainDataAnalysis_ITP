		<title>09STEVEN - LIVING WITHOUT CAR</title>
		<content> I have lived in Takeley for five      
 years. I live in a council house in   
 North Road with my mum and dad and two
 sisters.We dont have a motor car and  
 we are all used to walking.When we    
 shop for groceries we go to Bishops   
 Stortford which is four miles away on 
 the bus.This costs Â£6.24 return and   
 I think this is a lot of money.We     
 sometimes shop  in the village but    
 cant always get everything we want.On 
 Saturdays we often walk to Stortford  
 especially to see our Nan.We go on    
 holiday each year with Grandad and    
 Grandma who take us in their car.I    
 think having a car would help us to   
 get to places quicker but it does not 
 really bother me .I am used to        
 walking and I have not got a bike     
 because the roads around here are too 
 dangerous especially the A120.
