		<title>12HOUSES IN 1964 AND 1982</title>
		<content> There were 540 houses in Block 5 on   
 the 1964 map and 572 houses in Block 6
 on the 1964 map.In Block 5 in the 1982
 map there are 677 houses,and in Block 
 6 in the 1982 map are 1,033 houses.The
 reason for the sudden increase in     
 houses in Block 6 appears to be that  
 in 1964 there were lots of fields and 
 open rough land.This the farmers sold 
 to developers who built houses on the 
 land.There was little building space  
 to put houses in Block 5 so it hasn't 
 changed very much.The total houses on 
 the 1964 map on both blocks was 1,061 
 and 1,417 on the 1982 map.
