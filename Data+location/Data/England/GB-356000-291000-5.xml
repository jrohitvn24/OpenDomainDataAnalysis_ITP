		<content>       We saw some hens at  Mr Edwards'
 farm.   Their eggs were under the hay.
 There were four of them and they were 
 still hot because the hen had just    
 laid them.  Mr Edwards took away two  
 from the bottom and left two.   One   
 hen was sitting on some eggs on the   
 other stack of hay.   Another hen had 
 five chicks.    She had been able to  
 hatch them because Mr Edwards did not 
 find where she had laid the eggs.
