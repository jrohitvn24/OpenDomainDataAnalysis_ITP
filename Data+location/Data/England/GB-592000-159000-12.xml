		<title>12HOP FARMING IN LYNSTED  (1)</title>
		<content> Hops have been grown in this area     
 since 1946. There are approximately   
 137 acres of high alpha hops suitable 
 for stout beers. The best known types 
 of hops needed are Wye Target, Yeoman,
 Brewers Gold &amp; Northern Brewer. In    
 March the stringing is done on poles  
 or stilts. This is followed by culti- 
 vation &amp; nutrients are applied to the 
 ground during June, July &amp; August.    
 They spray the hops against aphids &amp;  
 mould. The main spray is called       
 copper. The hop bine should reach the 
 hop wires around the 21st June. The   
 first burrs should appear by the      
 second week in July. Harvesting is in 
 late August through to September. The 
 bines are pulled down by mechanical   
 hop pullers &amp; are taken to the picking
 shed. The machine shreds the hops &amp;   
 then they are taken to be dried in    
 oast houses.                          </content>
