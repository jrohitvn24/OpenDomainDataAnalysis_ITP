 Our village shop is a Spar shop,      
 belonging to te Spar group of         
 independent grocers. There has been a 
 shop on this site for over a hundred  
 years, having  been built there when  
 the previous shop in Sunton was burnt 
 down. The present owners are Mr.B.    
 Greening and Mrs. E. Abbot, and they  
 have changed the shop by extending its
 scope.The shop is basically self      
 service, supplying a wide range of    
 groceries,greengroceries,meat,bread,  
 wines and spirits,stationery and      
 newspapers.In the last year a         
 delicatessen and fresh meat section   
 has been opened.This has been very    
 popular as people do not have to go   
 out of the village for these items.   
 The Post Office is also in London     
 House.
