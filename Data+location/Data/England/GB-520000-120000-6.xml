		<title>06EMPLOYMENT.COWFOLD SURVEY.</title>
		<content> Employment in Cowfold is very varied. 
 We surveyed several roads in the      
 village but not all of them.Of the    
 people we received replies from, the  
 majority were owner/occupiers and we  
 had 115 people to base our results on.
   We recorded 89 people working,12    
 full-time housewives and 14 retired   
 citizens.                             
   Of the people working,59 work away  
 from Cowfold,16 people travel around  
 with their jobs and 30 people work in 
 Cowfold.Workers outside Cowfold are   
 based in surrounding towns like       
 Horsham,Crawley,Gatwick,Henfield,Brigh
 ton,Billingshurst,whilst a few travel 
 as far as Surrey or even London.      
   Most of the people who work in the  
 village are tradesmen and most of the 
 people who work outside Cowfold are   
 white collar workers.
