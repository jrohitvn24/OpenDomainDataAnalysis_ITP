		<title>08Living in an isolated area.</title>
		<content>We interviewed a lady in Prestwood.    
There are no shops and hardly any      
houses.She likes living there because  
it's peaceful,quiet countryside with   
lots of animals around.                
 She has letters delivered every day,  
milk every other day and papers aren't 
delivered.                             
 She has only been snowed in once in   
nine years,but she keeps the food      
cupboard well stocked during the winter
in case.                               
 She has a car and gets her groceries  
once a week.                           
 She thinks it's easier to live in an  
isolated place now than 50 years ago   
because the roads are better and more  
people have cars.                      
 She thinks the disadvantages of living
there are: lack of main drains,no gas, 
worrying about being cut off in the    
winter.She would like more neighbours. </content>
