		<title>14GAMES CHILDREN PLAY (a)</title>
		<content> In Pleasley many children play the    
 game 'Runacross'.This is a game that  
 can be played by a large number of    
 children, the more people playing the 
 more exciting and enjoyable is the    
 game. It is mainly played in the      
 school playground because two large   
 semi circles are needed. One person   
 has to be 'On', the person for this   
 role is picked by doing a 'Dip'. A Dip
 is when all the players stand together
 and a song is sung. e.g. 'Ip dip your 
 not it!'When you arrive at the last   
 person he or she is 'On'. The person  
 who is 'On' stands in the middle of   
 the two semi circles, the other       
 children then try to run from one     
 circle to the next without the person 
 who is 'On' touching or 'tigging' them
 as the children say. If a person is   
 'tug' they are then 'On' and take the 
 place of the person who was 'On'.     </content>
