		<title>10RIDING IN HORTON</title>
		<content>    Many people in Horton enjoy riding 
 horses or ponies.We have ponies of our
 own.We ride them all around the       
 squares that we are studying.Emma's   
 favourite ride is along the Seven     
 Mile Plantation and along Bodkin Hazel
 Track.A few times she has ridden from 
 Grickstone Farm to Dunkirk.           
    We belong to the Beaufort Hunt Pony
 Club.They hold rallies throughout the 
 year and a special week in the Summer.
 We have jumping,gymkhanas and pony    
 shows.The ponies have to be groomed   
 and shod.We have to look smart as well
 as our ponies.                        
   The Badminton Horse Trials are held 
 near here every year.The Quarry Jump  
 is in one of our squares.People come  
 from all over the world to the        
 Badminton Horse Trials. The Queen and 
 other members of the Royal Family are 
 usually there.  Emma Bright, Katherine</content>
