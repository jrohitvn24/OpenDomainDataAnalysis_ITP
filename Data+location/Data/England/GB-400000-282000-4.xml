		<content>Origins of place names in the area:-   
Harborne is mentioned in the  Domesday 
Book as Horeborne.                     
Ridgacre appears in record of AD 1271  
as Rugacre or Rugaker and again as     
Rugeacre in 1500.It probably means     
Â£ploughed land on the ridge'.          
World's End, so called because  it     
was a remote &amp; lonely place. Tom       
Prestein states in his History of      
Harborne that the field path from      
Mockbeggar came to an abrupt end       
here by a cottage &amp; garden.            
Tom Knocker's Wood once a remote and   
pleasant place in which one might be   
undisturbed all day, named either      
after a hermit who committed suicide   
or a highway man who was hanged for    
his crimes. This haunted wood once     
stood between Northfield Road and the  
allotments on Tennal Lane.
