		<title>03AKENSHAWBURN COTTAGES</title>
		<content> The two cottages at{Akenshawburn}have 
 been converted from farm buildings    
 sited in an isolated but beautiful    
 part of the Kielder Forest. They are  
 typical of many of the lonely         
 buildings in the area, in that they   
 are now serving a new purpose,        
 connected to the rapid expansion of   
 outdoor activities in education. The  
 cottages are now controlled by{South  
{Tyneside Local Education Authority}   
 ,and are used by pupils from primary  
 and comprehensive schools,as well as  
 groups from youth organisations.      
 Hill-walking,navigation and           
 orienteering are among activities     
 experienced by those visiting the     
 centre. The area is also a rich       
 environment for field-studies.
