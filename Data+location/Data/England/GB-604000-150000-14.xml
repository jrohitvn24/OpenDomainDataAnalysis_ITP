		<title>14MODERN BUILDINGS GODMERSHAM</title>
		<content> Being an area of outstanding natural  
 beauty little new building is allowed.
 The newest is Cort Lodge, built in    
 georgian style, just outside the walls
 of Godmersham Park.Agricultural       
 buildings at East Stour Farm and Pope 
 Street have been converted into luxury
 homes. A rare example of a completely 
 unmodernised farm can be seen at Hurst
 Farm beside the river Stour, without  
 electricity and with the original     
 oasts.                                
 In 1900 a public house stood at 7     
 Godmersham Park and the village once  
 supported a shop, post office, school 
 and forge. Sadly, along with the      
 vicarage these have now become unusual
 but pleasant homes.
