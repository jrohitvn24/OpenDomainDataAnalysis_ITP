		<content>     Wrestlingworth has several timber 
 framed and plaster cottages still     
 standing. Home Farm is probably the   
 oldest house in the village dating    
 from the 15th century. Hill Farm is   
 mentioned in the Victoria History and 
 dates from 1676. Several cottages have
 thatched roofs and coloured plaster   
 work. Ivy Cottage built 1820 and      
 standing near the school, has just    
 been rethatched.                      
     There are several houses dating   
 from early 1900 but most housing is   
 modern and has been built since the   
 end of the Second World War.
