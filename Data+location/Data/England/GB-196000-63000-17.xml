		<content>{ Cottages}are something like a        
 bungalow but they are older than a    
 bungalow because bungalows are very   
 new.Many of our homes are cottages.{  
{ Cottages}are sometimes big and       
 sometimes small.If the cottages are   
 big,I think they have got three or    
 four bedrooms up_stairs and the rest  
 down_stairs.If the cottages are small 
 they have two or three rooms upstairs.
{ Cottages}are old and are rough on the
 out_side.The walls are often made of  
 cob and are white-washed.             
{ Council houses} are sometimes        
 detatched and sometimes semi-detatched
{Council houses}have got three windows 
 and a door in the front. At the back  
 but they have got five windows and a  
 door.}Most have got numbers on their  
 front doors.Thre are twelve council   
 houses in our area.
