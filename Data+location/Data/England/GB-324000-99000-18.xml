		<content> The Tuckers Arms is a very old pub.   
 There is a skittle alley and a garden 
 with wooden tables .The pub may be as 
 many as 640 years old.Men are thought 
 to have lodged in the pub when        
 building the church.The Tuckers Arms  
 has a thatched roof and the building  
 is stone and cob with old wooden beams
 .Inside there is a flagstone floor and
 an inglenook fireplace. There  is a   
 public bar and a lounge bar. The Inn  
 is kept by Mr and Mrs Oakins   .On    
 Fair Day there  are stalls outside the
 pub. In May the school children do    
 Maypole dancing on the forecourt.     
   At one time there were seven ale    
 houses in Dalwood, some of them being 
 only one room of a farm house where   
 ale or cider could be obtained.       
   The Tuckers' Arms is now the only   
 inn in Dalwood.
