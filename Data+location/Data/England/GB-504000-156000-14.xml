		<content> This area is low-lying, crossed by the
 River Wey with its water meadows, and 
 includes woods,commonland and farmland
 (The RHS Garden at Wisley forms a     
 Special Feature). Marshland has kept  
 Wisley undeveloped. Ripley and Ockham 
 were underdeveloped as formerly owners
 refused to sell land and more recently
 because of Green Belt policies.       
 Pyrford, originating from a river ford
 is a straggle of farms and more recent
 development, with no natural centre.  
 Ockham was once a farming community   
 but is now becoming residential.Ripley
 was built along the Portsmouth Rd, but
 is now by-passed by a new road built  
 through Wisley resulting in the loss  
 of common land and part of its ancient
 pool. The soil is mostly sandy with   
 some clay. Trees are mainly oak and   
 silver birch. Ripley's large village  
 green has an avenue of limes.         </content>
