		<title>07The History of the school</title>
		<content>{We talked to a 70}year old lady on    
 North Street who told us school was   
{very different}in her day as they did 
 not have the pleasures we have. They  
 didn't go on school trips then. There 
 was all work and no play, now it's    
 some work and some play.In those days 
 it was much stricter you got the cane 
 for tiny mistakes. Children are no    
 longer frightened by their teachers.  
 The modern way is to blackmail you    
 by threatening to deprive you of any  
 pivileges if you misbehave.
