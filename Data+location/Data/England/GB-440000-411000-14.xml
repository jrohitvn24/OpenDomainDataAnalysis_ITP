 At home we have an Amstrad computer   
 with a built in cassette player and a 
 green screen monitor. We also have    
 twelve games, three of which are      
 educational.                          
 Our computer has a large memory and is
 different from the BBC computer.      
 I'd like to know more about computers 
 because it might be useful in the     
 future for studying.                  
 Nowadays there are computers          
 everywhere; in schools, homes and     
 places of work. I shouldn't like them 
 everywhere because people may be put  
 out of work.
