		<content> Altough on the fringe of Runcorn new  
 town there are a lot of much older    
 properties in the surrounding country.
 Most of these houses are detached and 
 very luxurious, the front gardens     
 extensive and the back gardens very   
 large. Some even had croquet lawns.   
 Most people own there own houses and  
 some of the more expensive costing    
 upwards of Â£70,000. The average is one
 of four bedrooms, having been owned   
 for 15 years with them moving in      
 because they liked the area. Residents
 are generally satisfied with the      
 location of the houses but not about  
 the local entertainment. Concern was  
 expressed over emergency accident     
 facilities being at Halton or         
 Warrington. Gardens are large enough  
 for children to play safely as there  
 is no pavement to the road.
