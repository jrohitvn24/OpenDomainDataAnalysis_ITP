 and a team of girls.The boys chase the
 girls.When they catch them they have  
 to kiss them,but if they stuggle they 
 are out.When every boy has kissed     
 every girl, the girls then chase the  
 boys.It goes on like that.            
  {Two Ball:}You need two balls.You    
 juggle against the wall and sing      
 rhymes while you are doing this.But   
 when you drop the ball or you don't   
 know any more rhymes you are out.The  
 other person has a go.It continues    
 like so.                              
   {Piggy backs:}You need two teams of 
 two and you have to try and knock each
 other off.You can hit each other,but
