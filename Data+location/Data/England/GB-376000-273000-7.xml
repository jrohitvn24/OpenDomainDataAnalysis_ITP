 Germany.                              
   The{River Severn}is in danger of    
 being turned into a pleasure boating  
 run from Gloucester to Shrewsbury. It 
 is planned to put locks and weirs.    
 Many of the inhabitants object to this
 scheme as they want the river left in 
 its natural state.                    
   In{Bewdley Safari Park}is the new   
 million pound ride called the Cobra.  
 Geoff Capes, the strongest man in the
