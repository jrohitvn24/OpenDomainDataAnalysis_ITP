		<title>11SOUTH CREAKE, LOCAL HISTORY</title>
		<content> The fact this is a Domesday village   
 means that this BBC project has       
 particular appeal.  The history       
 society researches village origins.   
 Bloodgate Hill, on Bluestone Farm, is 
 an ancient monument.  The little that 
 remains is appreciated best from      
 aerial photographs.                   
 The village existed in Saxon times,   
 and was assessed for Danegeld in      
 AD886.  The mediaeval Church of St    
 Mary, was rebuilt in its present form 
 by the Priory of Castle Acre.         
 The sites of two of the four Conquest 
 manors are known.  One has an occupied
 16 C. manor house.  The other site is 
 revealed by the outline of its        
 foundation, in a meadow between Church
 and School.  Authorities differ on the
 origin of the name.  One considers    
 that Creake derives from River, uses  
 the word for an escarpment.           </content>
