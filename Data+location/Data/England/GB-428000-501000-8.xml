		<content> There are a variety of clubs for young
 and old in North &amp; East Cowton.       
 Girls of seven can join the Brownies  
 held in term time at East Cowton.     
 At ten they can graduate to the Girl  
 Guides, also in East Cowton. Six year 
 old boys go to the Cubs held in North 
 Cowton, but have to leave the area to 
 continue with the Scouts in Scorton.  
 In North Cowton there is a flourishing
 Womens Institute which meets monthly  
 in the Village Hall. Occasionally the 
 40 members have bus trips but usually 
 they invite visiting speakers to their
 meetings. In East Cowton there is the 
 Yorkshire Womens Association which    
 meets monthly in members' homes.      
 In East Cowton there is a Gardening   
 Club, Football and Cricket Clubs, over
 60's club and weekly Youth Club.      
 Events are often organised by an      
 elected Sports &amp; Social Commitee.     </content>
