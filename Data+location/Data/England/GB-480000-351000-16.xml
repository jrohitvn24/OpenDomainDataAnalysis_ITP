		<title>16A TYPICAL WEEKEND</title>
		<content>{Sunday}I wake up at about 7 o clock   
 a.m.but I stay in bed until 7.30 when 
 my Dad brings me a cup of tea.I get up
 and dress and go into the kitchen for 
 breakfast.Afterwards I go out into the
 garden to feed the rabbits.We have a  
 large garden with lots of flowers.Then
 I go to Sunday school to help teach   
 the young children. They learn about  
 Jesus and prophets from small books.At
 12.00 I return home for dinner,       
 usually roast beef, potatoes  and     
 Yorkshire pudding.In the afternoon we 
 go to visit my parent's friends,or my 
 friends visit me. We play board games 
 and listen to records or we go out to 
 play tennis or go on a bike ride      
 around Balderton.After tea, which is  
 usually at 5.00 I watch television and
 then have a bath, get my books ready  
 for school and go to bed at 9.00 p.m.
