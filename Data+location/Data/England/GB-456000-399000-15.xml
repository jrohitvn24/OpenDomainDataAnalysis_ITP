		<title>15LUCY'S SATURDAY IN BALBY</title>
		<content> Usually I clean and feed our pets on  
 Saurday mornings. My brother holds    
 them while I clean the cages. I am 9  
 and my brother is 7. We have a white  
 rabbit with pink eyes named Snoopy, a 
 guinea pig called Ginger Biscuit, 2   
 goldfisn named Sooty and Sweep, a dog 
 named Sally and a cat named Tibby.    
 Sally is a black labrador. She is 12  
 years old. We don't know how old Tibby
 is. We found her as a kitten under a  
 bush on our allotment. She has ginger 
 and white fur and loves being stroked.
   All the animals eat food from the   
 pet shop. After cleaning the animals  
 we play all day except for meal times.
 In the evening we both go to the      
 Saturday Club run by the church. It's 
 fun. We play snooker or badminton. We 
 go to bed at 9pm after a pleasant day 
 of work and recreation.
