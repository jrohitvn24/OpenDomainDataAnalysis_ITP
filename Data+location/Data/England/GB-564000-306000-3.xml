 with the family eating at different   
 times.Tea time varied considerably

 substantial meal.Things that were     
 eaten were,hotdogs,dumplings,soup,    
 pizza,jacket potatoes,gammon,sausages,
 sweetcorn and pork slices.The children
 eat between meals from the variety of 
 sweet snacks and crisps. Drink is     
 either tea,coffee,fizzy drinks or     
 milk. Many had a drink prior to bed.

 light breakfast and a main formal meal
 with all the family. This meal was
