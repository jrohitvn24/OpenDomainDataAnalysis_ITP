		<title>09EMPLOYMENT IN LEADENHAM</title>
		<content> Employment in the early days was very 
 localised with few people travelling  
 out of the village itself.This is     
 basically an agricultural area and    
 most of the employment was            
 concentrated in that industry.There   
 has  always been a smithy once shoeing
 horses,now making farm machinery.     
 R.A.F.Cranwell,only five miles away   
 attracted employment and a number of  
 workmen used to cycle  there each day.
 As more people have their  own        
 transport,servicemen and civilians    
 live in the Village and travel to     
 Cranwell daily.Many people now also   
 travel into the towns of Grantham and 
 Lincoln each about 12 miles away.The  
 Lincs.Road Car Service links Grantham 
 and Lincoln and passes through        
 Leadenham enabling people from the    
 Village to travel to the towns for    
 employment in the shops and factories.</content>
