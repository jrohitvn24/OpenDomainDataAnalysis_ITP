		<content> The fox-hounds are born at the kennels
 and at the age of 12 weeks are sent to
 farms where they spend their first    
 year.After a year on a farm the young 
 fox-hounds return to the kennels for  
 training.They have a working life of  
 about 6 years.There are also 8 Jack   
 Russell terriers at the kennels which 
 are used to follow the fox down a hole
 where the hounds cannot go.The Hunt   
 meets at 11a.m. and has as many as 40 
 riders on a weekend meet and may hunt 
 all day,depending upon when they find 
 a fox.The hounds rely on their strong 
 sense of smell to track a fox and can 
 cover a distance of 40 miles in one   
 day.The kennel huntsman exercises the 
 hounds daily and they are fed fresh   
 meat.
