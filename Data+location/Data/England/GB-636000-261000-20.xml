		<content>I sometimes watch television when I get
 home to see what kind of programmes   
there is on.There is a Sports Park in  
Saxmundham but I don't use it very     
often. I belong to the Brownies we meet
every Friday at the Middle School at   
half past five until quarter to seven. 
Mrs Potter is in charge. My Dad belongs
to a dart team but my Mum does not     
belong to any.In Leiston there is a    
Sports Centre but I do not use it. On a
Saturday somtimes                      
 Daddy takes us to Gt. Yarmouth to the 
heated swimming pool we don't go there 
too often though. Every Summer we go on
holiday, this year we are going to     
North Wales we are going in a bungalow
