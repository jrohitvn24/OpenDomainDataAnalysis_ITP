		<title>16TACKLEY &amp; WOOTON FOOTPATHS</title>
		<content> There are 23 miles of{footpaths}in    
 the parish of Tackley.{The Wootton,   
{Tackley and District Footpath Society}
 exists for the enjoyment and          
 protection of the footpaths of both   
 parishes and beyond. Each month one   
 member leads a walk of about 5 miles  
 but once or twice a year we have an   
 all-day walk of about 10 miles. In    
 the winter, before the bird nesting   
 season, the group clears footpaths    
 that have become blocked by           
 undergrowth and erects signs where    
 necessary.                            
 The group has built bridges to cross  
 streams. Each {Summer }all the {      
{footpaths }are walked during{Footpath 
{Week} which is organised by the {     
{Parish Council}whose duty it is to    
 maintain the paths.
