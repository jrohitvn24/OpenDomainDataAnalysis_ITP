		<content> On 1st July 1985 I visited Porthcurno 
 Cable &amp; Wireless Ltd. with some others
 to get information for the Domesday   
 Project.{In 'The Tunnel'}the first    
 room we came to was the television    
 room. We were allowed to play with    
 some levers and also with some video  
 camera's. Next we went to a small     
{museum with early wireless and cable  
{equipment}in it. We went through a    
 door at the other end of the museum   
 and a man showed us{the fire escape   
{that leads up 119 steps through the   
{hill.}We came out on the top of the   
 hill and went up on top of a concrete 
 platform.{You could see for miles     
 around. As we went down the steps they
 were very slippery. Andrew was trying 
 to go down them too fast and he       
 slipped down about 3 stairs. Last of  
 all we went to the office where there 
 were two computers and a printer.     </content>
