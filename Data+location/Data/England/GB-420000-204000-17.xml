		<content>Work by the village ornamental black-  
smith can be seen in the Bridal Barn   
and at the Forge. The tiny Museum in   
the main street houses a collection of 
local bygones. It was started in the   
thirties by George Swinford, now 97,   
with support from Sir Stafford Cripps; 
in 1983 it was formally set up as the  
Swinford Museum in the ancient cottage 
given by Sir John Cripps. Adjoining is 
the village lock-up, used overnight by 
the drunk and disorderly before their  
appearance at Burford Magistrates'     
Court. The Victorian Church and the    
listed Council Houses attract special- 
ist visitors.                          
The small area of EASTLEACH in the bl- 
ock includes main tourist attractions  
of the village - the Clapper Bridge,   
the banks of the R Leach, bright with  
daffodils in the spring, and the two   
fine medieval churches and tithe barn. </content>
