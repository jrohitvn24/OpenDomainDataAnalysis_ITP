		<content>  Brayton was the estate of the wealthy
 Lawson family. Earliest records date  
 back to 1749. The most famous Lawson  
 was Sir Wilfred who was a Member of   
 Parliament, an author and a local     
 philanthropist.                       
  The original house was burnt down in 
 1929 and was never restored. During   
 the war the estate was taken over as a
 base for the R.A.F..                  
  The Lawson family died out and the   
 land now belongs to the Ward family,  
 who live in the original gardener's   
 cottage. Most of the 300 acres are let
 out for grazing, but the garden area  
 has been turned into a golf course and
 driving range for public use.         
  The Hall fish pond is open to the    
 public at Â£3 per day. Carp is the main
 fish caught.                          
  The Ward family hope to extend their 
 facilities in the near future.        </content>
