      The present Post Office has been 
 in existence for 23 years and prior to
 that was situated at what is now the  
 Old Post House.  Leigh Post Office is 
 one of the few remaining offices in   
 the district which still has mail sent
 from the G.P.O. for sorting and       
 delivery.  The postmistress collects  
 the outgoing mail twice daily from    
 the post box outside.  There is also a
 telephone kiosk.                      
                                       
      On average forty people a day use
 the post office, forty-eight people   
 collect retirement pensions and twenty
 -eight mothers collect family allow-  
 ances each week.                      
                                       
      The Post Office is housed in a   
 cottage which has been in the family  
 for over a hundred years.             </content>
