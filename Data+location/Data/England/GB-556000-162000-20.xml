		<title>20Village life in Ash</title>
		<content>{Ash}is a small village that has{litle 
{recent development.} Although the     
 village school shut some twelve years 
 ago and the village shop (also post   
 office) finally closed five years ago 
 there are still{two thriving pubs}in  
 the village.  The{church}flourishes   
 and a{parish hall}is well used, the   
 reason for these being associated with
 the development, since 1967, of{New   
{Ash Green}half a mile{to the north.   
                                       
 Reflecting what has been a{prosperous 
{community}the{houses}of the village   
 are{larger than average}for their age 
 and are set well apart. They straddle 
 the road through the village with no  
 side roads. Among the houses are      
 examples of{Kentish shiplap boarding  
 and also{flint construction.
