		<title>03The Church</title>
		<content> The clock in the tower was put there  
 as a memorial to the dead of the 1st  
 World War. Several gravestones have   
 been used to repair the church. These 
 can be seen along the south wall over 
 the windows. Presumably the stones    
 came from the graveyard as there is a 
 large patch of clear grass between the
 two gates. There is the stump of what 
 was possibly once the village cross.  
 This must have looked over the tiny   
 village square. This is now a parking 
 area. The wrought iron gates were made
 by the present village blacksmith. The
 graveyard has not been used for       
 burials since the 1920s. People are   
 now buried in the cemetery which is   
 situated on Thorpe Rd. Money raised   
 during the 800th anniversary          
 celebrations of the Priory is to be   
 used to repair the heating in the     
 church.                               </content>
