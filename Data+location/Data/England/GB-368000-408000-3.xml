		<title>03ST LUKE'S COURT,BOLTON</title>
		<content>   St Luke's Court is a home for old   
 people. My mum is the home's warden,  
 in charge of 40 flats. It is her job  
 to look after the health and safety of
 the people who live there.            
   Every morning,from her office, she  
 speaks to each flat on a central      
 intercom. If she gets no reply, or if 
 told someone is ill, she can go and   
 find out the problem.                 
   If someone is ill or injured they   
 can pull a cord in their flat to sound
 an alarm in the warden's house. The   
 warden goes to the central intercom   
 where a flashing light shows the flats
 number. She goes to see what is wrong.
   On the ground floor there is a      
 lounge where they can go for a chat,  
 also there is a kitchen where they can
 make coffee. There is bingo three     
 times a week and trips are sometimes  
 organised.                            </content>
