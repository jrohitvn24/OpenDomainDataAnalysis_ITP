		<title>09FARMER'S DAY IN TYWARDREATH</title>
		<content> My Dad is a{dairy farmer.}First of all
 he has to get up at 6a.m. and goes out
 to get the cows from the field where  
 they have been eating grass. Dad and  
 Rob the collie dog drive them to the  
 yard. Dad closes the gate on them and 
 they stay there while Dad is getting  
 hot water. When he comes back he goes 
 in the{milking parlour}and turns on   
 the machines. He lets the cows in     
 three at a time and starts milking. He
 washes their teats in hot water then  
 some special stuff that takes away the
 germs. After he has milked them he    
 lets them out in the waiting place    
 where there is grass for them to eat. 
 After he has done them all he takes   
 them to a field until it is milking   
 time again.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
