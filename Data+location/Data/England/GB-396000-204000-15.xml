		<title>15The Village Hall</title>
		<content>   The old village hall was destroyed  
 by fire in l975.  A stone building of 
 modern design replaced it.            
                                       
   A Social Club meets there 3 times a 
 week;  they have a bar, a skittle     
 alley and a pool table.               
                                       
   Other regular users are the         
 Daddypuff Club for elderly people,    
 and the Toddlers' Club for mothers    
 with young children. (Daddypuff is an 
 ancient nickname for Daglingworth).   
                                       
   The hall is also used for Yoga      
 classes and roller skating sessions   
 for children.  The School uses it for 
 parties and concerts and it is        
 available for private hire for wedding
 parties, celebrations and meetings.
