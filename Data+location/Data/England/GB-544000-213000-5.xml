		<content>  Before most of the housing estates   
 were built the land was farmland.{    
{Roseacres}got its name because there  
 were acres of land owned by a lady    
 named {Rose}.In{Stoneleigh}there used 
 to be a horse paddock ,an orchard ,a  
 boundary fence and got its name from a
 manor.It was built in{1888}and a      
 doctor lived there.As{Sawbridgeworth} 
 is not an{industrial}area the majority
 of jobs are concerned with{agriculture
{or small businesses.}Farmhouses and   
 cottages are spread out all over the  
 area. My house is  old,it's made out  
 of bricks on the outside and wood and 
 lath and plaster on the inside and the
 walls are hollow.We used to have an   
 old kitchen range in what is now the  
 living room.The people who lived here 
 before us used to get their water from
 a pump in our back garden.
