		<content> consists mainly in supplying sawn     
 timber, supplying and erecting        
 fencing, making gates and general     
 agricultural woodwork such as feeding 
 troughs and racks.Although the        
 blacksmith's side of business lapsed  
 20 years ago and the majority of the  
 ironwork is brought in from elsewhere,
 the forge is still in use for certain 
 items.Mr. Grabham employs 2 full-time 
 men who are responsible for sawing    
 timber and erecting fences.He uses a  
 great deal of larch wood, and some    
 Douglas Fir, Pine and Oak.All the     
 wood is obtained locally from the     
 National Trust, the Forestry          
 Commission and the Crown Estates.A 10'
