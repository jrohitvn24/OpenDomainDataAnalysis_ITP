		<content> In this area there are 123 houses in  
 Smarden, 71 in Headcorn and 11 in     
 Frittenden. There are 90 children &amp;   
 438 adults of whom 77 are senior      
 citizens. There is a nursing home in  
 Headcorn with 16 residents. An estate 
 of 38 mobile homes, an enclosed unit, 
 stands beside the Maidstone-Tenterden 
 road. It is beautifully maintained but
 no children or pets are allowed. The  
 Oaks estate in Smarden is owned by    
 Ashford Borough Council, apart from 1 
 house, bought by the tenant and now   
 resold. There are 16 semi-detached    
 houses &amp; 4 flats. Almost all the rest 
 of the housing in this area is        
 detached with good sized gardens, and 
 worth a high price. There are 9 oast  
 houses, formerly used to dry hops, now
 well equipped homes, and 2 barns have 
 also been converted to houses.
