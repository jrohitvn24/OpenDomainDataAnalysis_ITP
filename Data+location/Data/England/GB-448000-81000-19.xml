		<content>    The main tourist attractions of our
 area are{Rookley Country Park, horse  
{riding and lovely country walks.}To   
 make life easy for the walkers/riders,
 pathways and bridleways are well      
 marked; maps showing this information 
 can be bought from the I.O.W. Tourist 
 Centre in Newport. Leaflets giving    
 detailed instructions to ramblers who 
 want to follow the Worsley Trail or   
 Shepherds Trail which cross our area  
 can also be obtained.                 
    North Appleford farmhouse has been 
 converted into holiday cottages; these
 cottages are ideal for those "who want
 to  get away from it all". A car would
 be needed to drive up the long lane,  
 and there is no bus service nearby.   
    Rookley Country Park and the horse 
 riding facilities have been described 
 in detail on earlier pages(see pages  
 17,04 and 18).                        </content>
