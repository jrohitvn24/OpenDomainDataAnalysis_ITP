 Within this area are two churches of  
 artitectural interest.                
 All Saints-Chalfield                  
 The little Parish Church of All Saints
 adjoins the forecourt of Chalfield    
 Manor. Parts of the nave, which was   
 enlarged by Thomas Tropnell in the    
 15th.c., date from the 14th.c..       
 Tropnell also rebuilt the chancel and 
 added the hood which forms the porch  
 to the west door. A large buttress was
 added against the north wall in 1719  
 and in 1775 the vestry was added. The 
 earliest records refer to institutions
 to a chapel in 1316 and a church in   
 1349.
