  The Dunchurch Church is called       
 St.Peters Church. The vicar is the    
 Reverend Hughes who is now Rural Dean.
  The building of the Church was begun 
 in 1346 and most of the building was  
 done by monks of the Cistercian Abbey 
 at Pipewell in Northamptonshire,which 
 was founded in 1143,during the reign  
 of King Stephen.                      
  A previous Church was mentioned in   
 the original Domesday Book.           
   Interesting architectural features  
 include two aumbries in the North wall
 which were,in the past,used for the   
 storage of Church silver and possibly 
 other valuables.The stained glass     
 windows are all modern but high in    
 quality.There are six bells_the tenor 
 weighs 18cwt 12lb.Holy Communion is   
 celebrated every Sunday and there is  
 Evensong three Sundays a month.       </content>
