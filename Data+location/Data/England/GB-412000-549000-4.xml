		<content> At Luns House Farm we were introduced 
 to the farmer,we were then shown the  
 cows and sheep.then he opened one     
 poultry house which keeps hens in.In  
 one poultry house there were hens ten 
 months and in the other one they were 
 about sx months old. There were 1500  
 hens in one shed and each hen lays one
 egg per day.Altogether they lay 1200  
 eggs per day.The hens when fifteen    
 months old are killed.The chicks are  
 brought in at one day and start laying
 eggs at five months old.After hens    
 have                                  
 laid their eggs they are put into the 
 right sizes by their weight.They are  
 then sold at corner shops,by milkmen  
 and also bought by people passing by  
 the farm.
