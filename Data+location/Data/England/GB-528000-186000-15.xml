		<content> The hospital administrator stresses   
that they are very short of money.He   
blames this entirely on the present    
government.The Royal Northern is a     
local hospital which enjoys a good     
relationship with the public.It is     
also one of the largest employers      
in the area.                           
 The hospital administrators job is    
to make sure that employees do their   
jobs well and efficiently.He also has  
to organise meals,bedding,plunbing etc.
and indeed practically everything which
is not the responsibility of the       
medical staff.                         
 The medical side is the main          
controller of what happens in the      
hospital.The senior doctor emphasises  
that the medical staff try,as far as   
possible,to work according to the      
patients' wishes.
