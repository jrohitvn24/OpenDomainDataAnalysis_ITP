		<title>20COMPUTER SHOP IN BRIGG</title>
		<content> Mrs Sharon Chubb, my mum, owns Brigg  
 Computer Centre.  It is quite a       
 spacious shop with a friendly         
 atmosphere.  The skirting boards and  
 the door are painted bright poppy red 
 while the walls are painted a creamy  
 colour.  It opens every morning at l0 
 am and closes at lpm for lunch.  In   
 the afternoon it opens at 2.l5 pm and 
 closes at 5.3O pm.  The profit is     
 quite good and my mummy enjoys being  
 there.  The shop is closed on         
 Wednesday and for half a day on       
 Monday.  The phone is well used       
 everyday with mummy ordering things.  
 She has an assitant called Paul Moss  
 who helps a lot.  Some days Paul      
 Moss's mother comes in while mummy is 
 away on business.  Anybody is welcome 
 there.
