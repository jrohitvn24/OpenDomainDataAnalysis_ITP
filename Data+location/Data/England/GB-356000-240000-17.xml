		<title>17BARTESTREE CONVENT</title>
		<content>  Originally established in France and 
 called "Our Lady of Refuge," the      
 convent was rehoused at Bartestree,   
 in a building designed by a Mr.       
 Phillipps, in 1863, nearly 122 years  
 ago. It was built then as a           
 Benedictine monastry, which housed    
 40-50 people until the war.           
  The main function was to care for    
 those aged 12-30, particularly        
 children, who did not go to school,   
 but were taught by the nuns.          
  Then, because of financial problems, 
 a laundry was built to serve the whole
 area. In 1974, the convent was made a 
 self-sufficient, semi-enclosed one.   
  There are now 12 sisters, and the    
 convent, used for a while as a        
 teenager's home, is now a{home for old
{people.                               
                                       
                                       </content>
