		<title>04The Village of East Brent</title>
		<content>        The origins of the village date
 back for centuries. It is on the east 
 side of the Knoll, but stretches away 
 across flat land as far as the A 38.  
 The church and school are built at the
 foot of the Knoll and the oldest      
 houses are close to the church.       
        East Brent has two small       
 council house estates,including some  
 bungalows specially built for elderly 
 people. There has been some new houses
 built ths year, both singly and as    
 small estates. The older houses are   
 built singly with quite large gardens.
 The newer houses are in groups and    
 close together.                       
        There are some large farm      
 houses on the outskirts of the        
 village, these are usually isolated   
 and in the centre of their own land.
