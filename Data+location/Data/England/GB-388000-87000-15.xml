		<title>15LANDSCAPE OF TRIGON ESTATE/1</title>
		<content> Trigon is a private estate owned by   
 the Sturdy family.  It covers l,400   
 acres altogether, comprising of:-     
   550 acres are farmland              
   400 acres is working forest         
   450 acres is heathland/wasteland    
 Once the land was mainly heathland    
 with the river Piddle or Trent running
 through.  Now the land is turning to  
 pasture and forestry.  Both hardwood  
 and softwoods have been planted.  The 
 following comes from an 8 year olds   
 research:-                            
 "On Trigon there are lots of woods.   
 When you drive on the road quietly,   
 you can see deer running about.  They 
 are roe deer.  In some places there   
 are piles of pine trees which have    
 been cut down.  On the farm there are 
 thirty-two different fields.  There is
 a big house owned by Mr. Sturdy, and I
 have been in it.                      </content>
