		<title>19Castle &amp; Sugary Coves.</title>
		<content> Castle Cove is a very interesting     
 beach when it is high tide.It is best 
 to go swimming from the beach when it 
 is high tide because it is not so     
 rocky .A lot of people go to Castle   
 Cove because of the view of the river 
 mouth or to fish from the rocks.People
 catch mackerel,bass,wrass and pollock.
 The  cove is a very pleasant beach    
 for an evening walk or an evening     
 swim. The steps you walk down are     
 steep but safe.There is a             
 platform aWhen it is low tide there is
 lots of seaweed and rocks.But when it 
 is high tide there is hardly any beach
 and it is very stoney.At the top of   
 the steps there is a shop that is open
 all day.Also  there is a carpark  by  
 the shop,you can park there any time  
 without paying .There is a grassy     
 slope which leads up to the castle.
