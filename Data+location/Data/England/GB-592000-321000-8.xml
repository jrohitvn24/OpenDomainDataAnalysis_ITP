		<content> The church is named St Bartholomew's  
 church and was built in approximately 
 1380-1430.                            
 It is in the highest point in Brisley 
 and you can see the tower at a        
 considerable distance from all        
 directions.                           
 It is made from flint built with      
 buttresses to make the walls stronger.
 Inside the church,on the walls are    
 paintings which have faded and are    
 faint to see,one is a painting of St  
 Christopher.                          
 All kinds of services take place at   
 the church like baptisms, weddings and
 there are services for anybody who    
 wants to go to church on Sundays.     
 The Rector(Rev. A. Sawyer) doesn't    
 live in Brisley, he lives in Colkirk  
 and he looks after the parishes of    
 Whissonsett,Colkirk,Horningtoft and   
 Brisley.                              </content>
