		<content> all the village people,It was so fine 
 and tall and stately, No wonder they  
 admired it greatly." There are about  
{1,000}people living in the village,   
 and in 1978 when a survey was done by 
 W.E.A. about three quarters of the    
 working population were employed in   
 the village or within 5 miles of it.  
 28% of the adults living in Bumpstead 
 at that time were born in the village 
 and had lived there most of their     
 lives. The parish provides a variety  
 of employment with emphasis on        
{agriculture}and allied services,two   
 firms in the village being contractors
 engaged in the distribution and repair
 of agricultural machinery. There are  
 also two firms of builders, one of    
 which is run by the old Bumpstead     
 family, the Argents.There is also the 
 distribution depot of a national      
 bakery.                               </content>
