		<content> St. Peter's Church, Ilmer, is one of  
 the oldest in the Diocese of Oxford,  
 dating back to the 12th Century.  Some
 of it is Norman, but much was rebuilt 
 in the old perpendicular style about  
 1350.  The bell turret retains the    
 original timber framing covered by    
 modern weather boarding and pyramidal 
 roof and spire are covered in oak     
 shingles.  After much effort Â£8000 was
 raised a few years ago in less than   
 two years to reshingle the roof,      
 repair the tower and restore the      
 bells.  The benefice is held jointly  
 with St.Mary's Princes Risborough.    
 Owlswick Chapel is a well cared for   
 building dating back to the Civil     
 Wars, when the previous one was       
 destroyed.  It seats about 40 people  
 and there are two services a month.   
 It comes under the parish of Monks    
 Risborough.                           </content>
