		<title>06THE STORY OF THE VILLAGE</title>
		<content> There was a village here in Saxon     
 times.The village grew because it was 
 on an important crossroads.During the 
 Middle Ages it was quite important.   
 King John  built  a palace on Court   
 Green. He often came here.The manor of
 Bere Regis was big and the Turberville
 family were lords of the manor. There 
 were a lot of fires in the village    
 because the straw roofs burnt         
 quickly.So many people used to come to
 Woodbury Hill Fair that there was     
 trouble and fighting and the village  
 got a bad name.The population of the  
 village reached a peak of nearly 1500 
 people in the 19th century.After a    
 decline it is now rapidly approaching 
 that total again with the increase  in
 building.
