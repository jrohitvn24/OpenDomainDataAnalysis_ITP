		<title>12SPARE TIME</title>
		<content> In my spare time I go to the park,    
 about 5 minutes' walk away, with my   
 friends. Sometimes I go to the beach  
 or swimming baths with my sister 7,   
 brother 10, mum and dad. In the winter
 I watch television or read books. I   
 also go to the{Girl Guides}every      
 Tuesday. We earn badges and have to   
 learn all the things to do with a     
 particular badge.                     
   My spare time on a Sunday is spent  
 tidying my room, or helping dad in the
 garden, mowing the lawn, cutting the  
 edges of it with shears, brushing up  
 twigs and leaves, or weeding the      
 flower beds. On Thursdays and         
 Saturdays I go shopping with my mum   
 and later I help her put it away.     
   In his spare time my dad goes to his
 friend's house to practice playing his
 guitar and singing his songs.
