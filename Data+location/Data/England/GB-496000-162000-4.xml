		<content> Mrs Goodwin has{25 horses}at          
 Chobham Park farm. The husband rides  
 but the wife doesn't. She has 56 Acres
 of land. They do not own a riding     
 school but people own their horses and
 come to ride at her{stables.}The owner
 only trains her own horses. They keep 
 horses for the joy of it. The vet.    
 comes to the stables every fortnight. 
 Mrs Goodwin thinks horses should      
 be used for{hunting}because they      
 enjoy it. They have some{cattle}which 
 are sent to market. It is quite hard  
 working on a farm. They don't get many
{foals.}They buy horses when they are  
 about two years  old. They use their  
 horses for show jumping. They have    
{three cats}which are very friendly.   
 They are going to knock down their    
 house when they move into another     
 house. They have lived there for ten  
 years.                                </content>
