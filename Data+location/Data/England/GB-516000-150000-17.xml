		<title>17The Cemetery-Dorking NE</title>
		<content>   Dorking Cemetery was opened in      
 1856.It has slowly got bigger and now 
 covers about six acres and has one    
 chapel still in use .Only about one   
 fifth of the population is now        
{buried}-the rest are{cremated}.Most of
 the sandstone{tombstones}are wearing  
 away but these are still interesting  
 because of the beautiful hand carving 
 and sculpture.Some of them have       
 marbled family vaults beneath.Modern  
 gravestones are small,factory made and
 often carved by a computerized jig.   
   Cemetery{records}now only give      
 limited,less interesting information  
 than the old ones did.                
   There are 3 workers.Two men are     
 about 20yrs. They all need a special  
 temperament for the job.We were lucky 
 to see a monkey puzzle tree in        
 flower.There were yews and box trees  
 and some{wild orchids.                </content>
