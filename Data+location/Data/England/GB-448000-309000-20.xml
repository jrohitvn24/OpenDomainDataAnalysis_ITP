		<title>20LANDSCAPE NEWTOWN LINFORD</title>
		<content> Newtown linford is a small but very   
 pretty village. It has a small school 
 with about 35 pupils,a cricket ground,
 a village hall and two restaurants.   
 The main attraction is Bradgate Park. 
 Most people do not work in the village
 because there is only a post office   
 and a small food shop. Nearly every   
 house has a large garden. In summer   
 many tourists come to the village and 
 to Bradgate Park. There is a Working  
 Men's Club which has snooker and a    
 bar. There is a Sunday School for     
 children and a church for adults.As   
 soon as children are eleven they can  
 join the Crusaders where you do bible 
 readings, go camping and play         
 sports.The village has two farms.A new
 cafe has just opened. There is a      
 garden centre which sells             
 sheds,greenhouses and plants.
