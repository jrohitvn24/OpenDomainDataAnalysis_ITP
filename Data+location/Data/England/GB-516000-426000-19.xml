		<title>19A MARKET SURVEY IN HEDON</title>
		<content>{A Visit to the Market Place.}         
 At school we were interested in       
 finding out whether the people of     
 Hedon wanted an open{market}.We made a
 questionnaire and interviewed some of 
 the shoppers in Hedon.                
 The majority of people we spoke to    
 were in favour of having a market.They
 felt that it would improve the        
 shopping facilities of the town.They  
 thought it would help to lower the    
 prices,provide a greater variety of   
 goods on offer.                       
 Some people were against a market     
 because they thought it would cause   
{traffic }problems,would increase the  
 amount of{litter},too many strangers  
 would visit the town and spoil the    
 friendly atmosphere.Some of the       
 shopkeepers felt that it would damage 
 their business.                       
                                       </content>
