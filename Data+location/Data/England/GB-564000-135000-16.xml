		<title>16    A Schoolday in 1985</title>
		<content>  I am called Clare and I am 9 years   
 old. I awake at 7.30am, have a wash   
 and then dress in my school uniform. I
 do my piano practice before I have a  
 breakfast of cornflakes and toast.    
 Then I clean my teeth and collect my  
 swimming kit. Soon I join other       
 children in the school taxi. At school
 we play a game in the playground until
 9 o'clock when we go to our classrooms
 to have the register marked. Then we  
 go to the hall for assembly and hymn  
 practice. After that, it's swimming in
 the school pool until break-time.     
 Break lasts 15 minutes and it's back  
 to a maths lesson. We finish at noon  
 for lunch, which we have in the school
 hall. Then more lessons until 3.30p.m.
 At home time I go for a piano lesson. 
 Later I have an evening meal. Then I  
 watch T.V. for a while, before I go to
 bed at 8.30p.m. Tuesdays are so busy! </content>
