		<title>18THE HISTORY OF THE SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The Bradwell school is built where it 
 is because it is in the middle of     
 everywhere.The school opened in 1979  
 at that time there were 29 children.It
 started of as a combined school ages  
 from 5 to 12.In September 1981 there  
 were 271 children.1982 there were 464 
 children.In 1983 there were 578       
 children.September 1984 there were 564
 children July 1984 there were 598     
 children.1984 it turned into a middle 
 school with 380 children.1985 there   
 were 411 children.There are two       
 playgrounds designed because there    
 would be to many children in one.The  
 reason why we have a conservation area
 is because some animals are in danger 
 of becoming exstinct.The Headmaster of
 the school thought the domesday       
 project was a good idea and seem to be
 organized well.
