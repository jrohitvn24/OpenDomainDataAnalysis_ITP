		<title>11Recreation 2 - Yardley</title>
		<content>The hours of the week spent by a family
on recreation varied,the least being   
about ten and the most about forty,but 
on average people seem to spend about  
twenty five to thirty hours a week on  
leisure activities.One family spent as 
much as 25 pounds each per week on     
their leisure,mainly because they went 
to the pub every night,but two retired 
people spent only one pound each.On    
average adults seem to spend about five
to ten pounds and children two pounds. 
Hobbies were very varied.Men mentioned 
darts,drinking and car maintenance,    
women walking and knitting and         
children things like dancing,swimming, 
and playing computer games.Going to the
pub was the most popular outing,not    
many people going to the cinema,the    
theatre or to play bingo.Some families 
did go out for a meal for an outing but
otherwise did not do a lot together.   </content>
