		<title>17Wormley Against Spurs-WASP</title>
		<content> Near Wormley JMI, opposite the playing
 fields, there is a piece of land which
 Tottenham Hotspur PLC want to develop 
 as their new training ground. Since   
 this is agricultural land permission  
 from the Local Council must be sought.
 The present plans include four full   
 sized football pitches and various    
 buildings for changing facilities.    
                                       
 Part of the same project is the       
 purchase of the adjoining Wormleybury 
 House, a listed building, for a hotel.
 At the two recent public meetings to  
 discuss the proposals, the local      
 residents voiced their fears of       
 increased traffic spoiling the        
 character of the village. Broxbourne  
 Council Planning Committee have       
 rejected the proposals and the matter 
 has gone to appeal to the Ministry of 
 the Environment.                      </content>
