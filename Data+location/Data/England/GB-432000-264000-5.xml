		<title>05THE JEPHSON GARDENS.</title>
		<content>     The beautifully kept Jephson      
 Gardens are situated on the banks of  
 the River Leam, and have entrances on 
 the Lower Parade, Newbold Terrace and 
 Willes Rd. Mr Willes gave the land for
 the gardens but they were named after 
 Dr. Henry Jephson. Monuments were     
 erected in their memory.              
   The Jephson Gardens cover an area of
 thirteen and a half acres. There are  
 four fountains in the gardens. Two are
 modelled on the fountains at Hampton  
 Court. The Hitchman Fountain no longer
 works being blocked with cedar        
 needles. The Czech Fountain           
 commemorates Czech Parachutists killed
 in World War2.                        
   The   nurseries in the middle of the
 Gardens grow plants for decorating    
 The Parade boarders, Pump Room Gardens
 and the Flower Clock which this year  
 commemorates International Youth Year.</content>
