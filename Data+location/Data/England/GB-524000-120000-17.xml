		<content> The local pub is called The Eight     
 Bells after the peal of bells in the  
 church, one of the finest in Sussex.  
 The Queen's Head is so-called because 
 Queen Anne gave a "bounty" to the     
 church. Her coat of arms still hangs  
 there. The Glebe field used to be part
 of the vicar's living and goes back at
 least to 1736 and probably longer. We 
 surveyed and dated the Glebe hedge to 
 find that i is 400-500 years old. It  
 is now rented to the school and the   
 cricket club.                         
 About 15-20 peaople attend ordinary   
 services but the church is full for   
 Christmas, Easter, Harvest Festival   
 and Mothers' Day services. There is no
 Sunday School. Children attend with   
 their parents.                        
 The vicar is usually chairman of the  
 Governors of the local school.
