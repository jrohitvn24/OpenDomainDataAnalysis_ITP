		<content>    As much land as possible is        
 ploughed for arable crops.Winter wheat
 is the most profitable followed by    
 winter barley,spring barley and oats, 
 oil seed rape and spring peas are used
 for break crops.Sheep farming involves
 breeding lambs and fattening them for 
 slaughter;cattle are increasingly     
 unprofitable due to the high cost of  
 finance.The land is mostly good       
 quality,medium loam overlying         
 whinstone with patches of heavier clay
 and sand;in good seasons it yields    
 well but the east coast climate with  
 its cool summers and strong winds is a
 problem.The west half of the block is 
 well sheltered with woods,but the east
 half which slopes down to the sea is  
 almost entirely exposed to the        
 north,east and south winds.
