		<title>20Peoples feelings on Uxbridge</title>
		<content> Children and parents discussed their  
 feelings about living in this         
 area.Generally people were happy      
 living here,but there were a few      
 moans.They felt there should be more  
 places for children and sport centres 
 for all ages.In Uxbridge,there should 
 be an indoor-swimming pool.Unused     
 areas should be made into parks.The   
 council take away old swings and      
 slides but do not replace them,so the 
 parks are becoming boring for         
 children.More activities for children 
 could be available during the         
 holidays.There is not a cinema in this
 area  also.Too many office blocks are 
 being built. Supermarkets could have  
 wider entrances for people in wheel   
 chairs and also the 10 pence deposit  
 on trollies was unpopular.
