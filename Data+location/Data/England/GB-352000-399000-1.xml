		<title>01AREA OVERVIEW</title>
		<content>  The square which we were allocated   
 covers the Billinge, Garswood and     
 Downall Green area. The outstanding   
 feature of the area is the beacon     
 which is situated on top of Bilinge   
 Hill.                                 
  In the past the land was used for    
 mining but now there are only two     
 mines left in the area, both of which 
 are privately owned. In some places   
 opencast mining made the arable land  
 only suitable for dairy farming. The  
 land is now mainly used for farming,  
 cereal crops are the main crop, with  
 some potatoes.                        
  Billinge is an old settlement with   
 several old buildings made of stone   
 from the old quarry, but the modern   
 houses are made from brick. It is     
 reputed that some of the old houses   
 are haunted. People have moved from   
 urban areas to swell the population.  </content>
