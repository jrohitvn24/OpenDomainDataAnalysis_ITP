		<title>15Vicar of Upper Nidderdale</title>
		<content> The Church of England's Vicar of Upper
 Nidderdale lives in Pateley with his  
 wife and family. The Churches he is   
 responsible for are at Middlesmoor,   
 Ramsgill, Wilsill, Bewerley, Greenhow 
 and Pateley Bridge. As his area is so 
 large, he has two people to help him  
 with his preaching. There are about   
 three and a half thousand people in   
 his parish. His day usually begins at 
 7:30am. He is in church every day at  
 8:30am. He rings the church bell to   
 tell the local people he is there     
 for prayer if they wish to join him.  
 After this, his day is filled with    
 letter writing, home and hospital     
 visiting and he also has various      
 meetings to attend. He also visits    
 some of the local schools, runs the   
 Followers Club on a Tuesday and the   
 Youth Club on a Friday. His day       
 usually ends at about 10:30pm.        </content>
