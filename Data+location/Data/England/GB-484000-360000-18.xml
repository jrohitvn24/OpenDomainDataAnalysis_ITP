		<title>18TRANSPORT IN SWINDERBY.</title>
		<content>   Many  residents  of  Swinderby  have
 a {bicycle }for  use locally  and most
 families  have  at least one{car.}This
 may  belong  to  their  employer. Many
 ladies  have a small car for shopping,
 taking the children to school,going to
 work and other activities.            
   The {railway station}is north of the
 village.Trains run regularly to Newark
 and  Lincoln  with  connections to all
 parts of the country.                 
   Before 1980 there  was a{bus}through
 the  village  only on  a Wednesday and
 Friday.The service has slowly improved
 and now buses run hourly  from  7.24am
 to  7.34pm to Newark, 5 of these go to
 Manchester. The  first  bus to Lincoln
 leaves  at 7.34am. and the last leaves
 at  10.17pm. In  January  1985 the bus
 routes   were   changed   to   include
 Collingham, so the Library and Doctors
 Health Centre can be reached easily.  </content>
