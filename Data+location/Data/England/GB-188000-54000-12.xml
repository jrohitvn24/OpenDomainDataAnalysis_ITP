		<content> Mr &amp; Mrs Wimberley are the tenants of 
 Resurrance Farm which they rent off   
 Prince Charles.Their attractive farm  
 house was built over 300 years ago.   
 The farm is 194 acres and is split    
 into 3 separate parts. The land use is
 114 grass, 70 acres barley and 10     
 acres wheat. Most of the grass is     
 used to keep 150 ewes,24 lambs, 50    
 Friesian cows and 30 calves.The 150   
 ewes can normally be expected to      
 produce over 200 lambs per year for   
 meat.The Friesians are a milk herd and
 calves are bought in from other       
 farmers for fattening. There is a lot 
 of machinery on the farm, examples    
 being 3 tractors 1 plough ,1 baler    
 and 3 trailers. The whole farm is     
 worked by 5 people, 3 who work on the 
 farm and in the farm house. Resurrance
 farm is typical of our area.
