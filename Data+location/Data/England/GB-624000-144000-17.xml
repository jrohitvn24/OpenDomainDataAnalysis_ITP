		<title>17Change in Lydden-Mrs.Bradley</title>
		<content>Many changes have taken place during   
her lifetime and she has seen many     
amenities disappear. There used to be  
three shops in the village but only the
Post Office/General Store now remains. 
The railway station was closed in April
1954. Mrs Bradley remembers that there 
were three bus companies operating in  
Lydden in the early 1920s.A Wesleyan   
Methodist Chapel was demolished in 1969
leaving two Churches in present day    
Lydden. In the 1920s water was laid on 
to Lydden village and in 1956 street   
lights were erected.In 1940 Lydden     
Primary school was built and Mrs       
Bradley recalled that when she was in  
school,children did not have to wear   
uniform. Mrs.Bradley felt that Lydden  
used to be a united village.There are  
many more houses now and she feels that
there is no village atmosphere as many 
people work outside the area.          </content>
