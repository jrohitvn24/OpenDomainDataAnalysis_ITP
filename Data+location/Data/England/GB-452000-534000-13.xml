		<title>13A Dockland Visit (Part 2)</title>
		<content>{The Headland-H/pool By Nicola Parvin  
             {and By Christopher Hill  
 On our visit to H/pool Docks we walked
 along a dirt road to the Life-boat    
 cabin to see the Life-boat,which is a 
 plastic dinghy with an outboard motor.
 The Lifeboat is called "Friendship 3".
 On our visit we saw two,tugs and their
 names were 'Hart'and'Stranton'.They   
 were built in Devon in 1958 and are   
 both called after districts of H/pool.
 H/pool Docks import cars,timber,paper 
 and grain and export scrap metal.Next 
 we went to see the dredger to find out
 how it works.It works by sucking silt 
 off the bottom of the sea.A man showed
 us some of the{marine life}that the   
 dredger sucked up off the bottom.On   
 the way back to the school we saw     
 another Life-boat called{The Scout.}
