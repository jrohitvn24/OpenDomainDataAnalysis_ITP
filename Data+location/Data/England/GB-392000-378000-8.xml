		<title>08SMALLHOLDING - POTT SHRIGLEY</title>
		<content> Homestead Farm is not a typical farm  
 in Pott Shrigley. Situated in a       
 sheltered valley below open moorland, 
 with the old stone house of Pott Mill 
 as its centre, its 10 acres of land is
 given over to rearing pedigree goats, 
 sheep &amp; pigs. The owners are members  
 of the Rare Breeds Survival Trust.    
 Sheep are mainly Herdwicks, Rylands &amp; 
 North Ronaldsays.The goats are British
 Saanen, Anglo-Nubian, British Alpine &amp;
 Toggenberg.They also own a valuable   
 Angora male-goat.Tamworth pigs are in 
 danger of extinction today but at     
 "Homestead"they have several sows &amp; a 
 boar.A Dexter cow, two ponies,hens    
 ducks &amp; geese complete the livestock  
 cared for by this enthusiastic family,
 to whom old-fashioned farming is not  
 just a full time job but a way of     
 life.
