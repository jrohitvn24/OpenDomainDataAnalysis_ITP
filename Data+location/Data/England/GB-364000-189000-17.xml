		<title>17A DAY IN SCHOOL</title>
		<content> When the bell goes in the morning     
 we line up and go into the hall for   
 assembly.The Head teacher talks to us,
 we say our prayers and then sing a    
 hymn.After that we go back to class   
 and our teacher calls the register.   
 There is a list of things written on  
 the blackboard which we have to do    
 throughout the day.We work until half 
 past ten and then we go out to play   
 for fifteen minutes.The girls often   
 play bulldogs and the boys usually    
 play football.We go back to class and 
 work until midday.Then we have dinner 
 and go out to play until quarter past 
 one.We do our work until half past    
 three usually art and individual      
 topic.If we have not finished our     
 maths and English we do that          
 instead.Then we go home.
