		<title>13HOLME PIERREPONT HALL</title>
		<content>{  Holme}(the Saxon word means island) 
 is a gravel bank raised above the     
 flood level of the River Trent, and is
 recorded in the{Domesday Book.}It is  
 surrounded by{gravel pits,}some still 
 being worked.                         
   The Hall is now the home of Robin   
 Brackenbury and his wife, Elizabeth,  
 herself a descendant of Sir William   
 Pierrepont, who built it in the{early 
{16th century.}                        
   It was the{first manor house in the 
{country to be built of brick,}and the 
 long red front has hardly changed to  
 this day. The inside was left a wreck 
 after being requisitoned in two world 
 wars, and a lot is being done to      
 restore it, to eliminate dry rot and  
 replant the gardens.                  
   The Hall is open to the public on   
 four afternoons a week during the     
 summer (entrance fee - Â£1.20)         </content>
