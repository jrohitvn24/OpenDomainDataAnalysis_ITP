When pregnancy has been confirmed,     
women are advised to visit their doctor
or midwife once a month.At l4 weeks    
into pregnancy a visit is made to the  
West Suffolk General Hospital in Bury  
St Edmunds, for an examination by an   
obstetrician which includes an         
ultrasound scan (to give a picture of  
the baby), together with blood &amp; urine 
tests.Women over 37 years are advised  
to have a test for abnormalities       
including Down's Syndrome in the baby  
and, if necessary, can have the        
pregnancy terminated. From 32 weeks    
checks are increased. Most confinements
take place in hospital, very few at    
home. Transport is by car or ambulance.
Babies are born naturally,by induction 
or Caesarian section. Hospitalisation  
is from 6 hrs to 8 days. After this a  
midwife visits til baby is l4 days old.</content>
