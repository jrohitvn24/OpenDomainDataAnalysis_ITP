		<content> Northborough School is very popular   
 because of it's high standard of work,
 especially reading in the younger     
 classes. This school only accepts     
 children from the ages of 4 to 11.    
 The children come from Northborough   
 and by bus from Maxey, Deeping Gate   
 and Deeping St. James. Northborough   
 School is on of the smaller schools in
 Peterborough. It has 176 children and 
 six and a half teachers. We do a great
 variety of work, often working  as    
 part of a group in a problem solving  
 way. We have a four acre orchard with 
 two bee hives and a pond which are    
 often used by other schools. We have  
 many other visitors, including groups 
 of teachers and Education Officers who
 come to Northborough to look at the   
 work of the school, especially our    
 reading approach and the group work.
