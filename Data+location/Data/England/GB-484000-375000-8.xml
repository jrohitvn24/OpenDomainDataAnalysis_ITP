		<title>08Kettlethorpe/Fenton Concerns</title>
		<content> Social concerns include a busy main   
 road through Fenton, lack of public   
 transport and facilities for          
 teenagers. Deceptive bends on the main
 road and speeding traffic have caused 
 several accidents. Rising bus fares   
 and fewer passengers have caused a    
 reduction in services. There is little
 opportunity for youngsters to get to  
 the nearest towns &amp; no possibility of 
 transport home. No playing/field/area 
 exists where youngsters can meet. They
 tend to congregate around the bus     
 shelter and indulge in minor acts of  
 vandalism. Intensive farming methods  
 producing eggs, chickens and pigs     
 create problems. Strong smells and    
 meal dust periodically pervade the    
 air, mainly when waste is removed and 
 slurry is spread on surrounding       
 fields. Late deliveries of mail and   
 newspapers are a minor irritant.      </content>
