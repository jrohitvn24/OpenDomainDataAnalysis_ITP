		<title>14The Droitwich Canal</title>
		<content> The canal ran from its junction with  
 the Worcester and Birmingham Canal at 
 Hanbury, through Droitwich            
 and into the River Severn at Hawford. 
 It was built following an Act of      
 Parliament in 1768 to carry salt from 
 Droitwich down to the Severn and      
 thence to the port of Bristol. The    
 cost of building the canal was Â£23,500
 . It runs sided by side with the River
 Salwarpe for some 6.75 miles with     
 eight locks. The boats were 64 feet by
 14.5 feet. The salt industry declined 
 from 1860 onwards and with it, the    
 canal. A proposal to turn the canal   
 into a railway was resisted and it    
 fell into disuse in the mid 1920's. It
 was closed by an Act of Abandonment in
 1939. In 1973 a charitable group      
 consisting of volunteers started to   
 restore the canal. The Droitwich Canal
 Trust has much work left to do.       </content>
