		<content> The corrugated board is then is then  
 converted into containers of all sizes
 and shapes to customers specifications
 in the conversion departments of the  
 factory.Post printing is crude and    
 resricted to large printing and line  
 drawings.If a customer wanted         
 photographs and fine printing to      
 advertise his goods on a box, before  
 pre-print arrived, sheets of paper had
 to be printed outside of the factory  
 by specialists in corrugated cardboard
 .This was very expensive and time     
 consuming.Because pre-printing is on  
 one layer of paper colour photographs 
 and very fine printing can be acheived
 at a very reasnoble cost, on paper    
 used in the make up of the corrugated 
 board.
