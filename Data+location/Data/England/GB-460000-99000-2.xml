		<content> Memories of a{'Gosportian'}           
      How has our area changed since   
 the Second World War?  _ We asked a   
 frequent visitor to our school, Mrs.  
 Kath. Habens  who has lived here all  
 her life, serving as a WREN in        
 Portsmouth during the war.            
      She told us that the old part of 
 Gosport shows most signs of change    
 resulting from bomb damage and        
 re_development. All that remains of   
 Gosport's railway station are the     
 platforms and station building, both  
 in a derelict state. She remembers the
 rows of small houses, St. Matthew's   
 Church and the School by St. George   
 Barracks, now a car park and boat     
 building area.                        
      The ferry area too, has changed. 
 She used to catch a small ferryboat   
 across to Portsmouth and there was a  
 'floating bridge' drawn by chains.    </content>
