		<title>12COUNTRY PARK-FLORA &amp; FAUNA.</title>
		<content> 100 ACRES OF TREES AND FLOWERS MAKE UP
 THE PARK. IT IS SPLIT INTO 2 PARTS. ON
 1 SIDE THE SOIL IS PERFECT FOR        
 FLOWERS. ON THE OTHER SIDE, THE SOIL  
 IS ACID AND GORSE AND HEATHER GROWS   
 THERE.{90% OF THE WOOD IS CONIFER.    
 THERE ARE LOTS OF BIRDS IN THE PARK   
 INCLUDING TREECREEPERS, ROBINS,       
 JAYS, GOLDCRESTS AND ALL TITS. MOST OF
 THE SHRUBS ARE EITHER GORSE, OR IN THE
 ACID AREA, RHODODENDRON. THERE ARE 2  
 PONDS, 1 FOR THE FISH AND 1 WITH      
 TADPOLES. MAMMALS FOUND ARE FOX,      
 STOAT, WEASEL, RABBIT AND ROE DEER.   
 THE ONLY SNAKE IN THE PARK IS THE     
 ADDER WHICH IS QUITE COMMON. THE ADDER
 IS ALSO FOUND IN THE{HOLT LOWES,}AN   
 AREA OF HEATH LAND NEAR THE PARK BUT  
 THE PARK HAS THE MOST. IN SUMMER THERE
 ARE LOTS OF BUTTERFLIES IN THE DAYTIME
 AND A GREAT VARIETY OF MOTHS AT NIGHT.
