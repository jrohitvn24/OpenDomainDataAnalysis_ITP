		<title>09ADVERSANE CARAVAN PARK</title>
		<content>  In order to stop gypsies and other   
 travellers parking their vans in      
 lay-bys etc off main roads, local     
 Councils were required to establish   
 permanent sites. One such was provided
 six years ago on the western side of  
 the A29, half a mile south of the     
 hamlet of Adversane                   
  The park, which is well screened from
 the road, has a permanent utility     
 block and plots for twelve caravans.  
 Each plot has a metered electricity   
 supply. Although intended to serve    
 itinerent travellers, most of the     
 present occupiers live permanently on 
 the site.                             
  One plot is occupied by a council    
 appointed warden who breeds dogs as   
 well as managing the site. Other      
 occupants are scrap metal dealers,    
 horsebreeders and casual labourers.   
 Children attend the local school.     </content>
