		<content> The earliest mention of Chapelthorpe  
 Church is in 1285, when it was called 
 Schapelthorpe. The earliest building  
 was just one of the chapels of Sandal 
 Magna parish along with the other     
 scattered Hamlets or Thorpes like     
 Painthorpe and Hollingthorpe. The     
 early chapel was 18 metres long and 7 
 metres wide, it's nave and chancel    
 were under the one roof, and it had   
 the early English style of            
 architecture, it had no tower, the    
 widows were lancets, with probably a  
 three lancet window at the East end . 
 The chancel was raised a single step  
 above the nave floor level, and       
 probably the latter was unpaved and   
 occasionally strewn with rushes. On   
 19th June 1951 a tragic fire gutted   
 the Church's interior including the   
 main Window. A new Church was         
 erected shortly after.                </content>
