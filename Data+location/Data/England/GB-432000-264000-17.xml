		<title>17POLICING LEAMINGTON SPA.</title>
		<content>   The crime rate in Leamington Spa is 
 not high compared to Birmingham or    
 London but it is the second highest in
 Warwickshire (Nuneaton first,         
 Rugby third, Stratford fourth).  The  
 crimes recorded number 8 000 to 9 000 
 incidents each year.  The detection   
 rate is 40%.                          
   Murders in Warwickshire average     
 3 or 4 each year.  Theft in shops is  
 quite a big problem but 99% of this   
 crime is detected by the police, but  
 not all cases are reported. Drugs     
 (cocaine,marijuana, cannabis) are     
 fairly common in Leamington and a lot 
 of glue sniffing goes on.             
   There are 900 police in the force   
 and 20% of them are women. There are 5
 departments and the operational area  
 is 48 square miles.
