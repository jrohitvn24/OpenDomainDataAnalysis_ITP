		<title>20Cowton's Strange Happenings</title>
		<content> Several houses in the area are report-
 ed to have ghosts. Neville House in   
 North Cowton is haunted by a little   
 girl wearing a smock, who died with   
 her three brothers during a diptheria 
 epidemic in the 1890's. She has been  
 sighted twice in the last 15 years.   
 Subsequently her parents had a second 
 family, most of whom lived locally    
 until the 1970's. The ghost of an old 
 soldier, Frank Bainbridge, was seen   
 recently in Fern Lea Cottage, N Cowton
 and a ghost has been seen at Temple   
 House Farm, East Cowton. There is     
 supposed to be a presence on the old  
 road near Atley Hill.                 
 There have been reported sightings of 
 U.F.O.'s in the area. Often these are 
 low flying aircraft going to Teesside 
 Airport, low flying R.A.F. jet        
 fighters which regularly fly over, or 
 flashes from Catterick army ranges.   </content>
