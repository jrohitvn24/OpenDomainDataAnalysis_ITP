		<content>   The Hollywood Tower Estate was      
 formerly owned by Lady White, wife of 
 the founder of the Bristol Aeroplane  
 Company.  On her death it was bought  
 by the Bristol Zoological Society.  It
 is some 100 acres in extent, and is   
 used to provide extra room.           
   Here, in the quiet of the           
 countryside, rare species, such as    
 lemurs, marmosets, okapi and white    
 tigers are bred in special enclosures 
 During the winter species such as the 
 llama are overwintered.  Surplus      
 animals are also kept here.           
   The land is farmed to produce food  
 for the Zoo.  Carrots, hay, straw,    
 wheat, barley and kale are some of the
 crops grown.  There is also a nursery 
 producing bedding plants for the      
 floral displays.                      
   Soft fruits are also produced for   
 birds, animals and the public.        </content>
