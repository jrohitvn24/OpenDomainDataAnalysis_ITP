		<content> BOSBURY ROUNDERS CLUB                 
                                       
 Bosbury W.I. have a ladies' rounders  
 team. They play every Monday evening  
 against other local W.I. teams. The   
 pitch they play on is marked out in   
 one of the farmer's fields.They have  
 two sides of eight. The idea is to    
 score as many rounders as possible.To 
 do this you must hit the ball and run 
 a clear round with out stopping.The   
 pitch consists of four posts set out  
 in a square. To get a runner out you  
 must hit the post they are running to 
 with the ball. They also play many    
 friendly mixed matches, which are good
 fun for getting everyone together.
