		<content> In this sector there is Coventry's    
 Council House and Offices.The Chamber 
 where the elected councillors meet    
 every month is there.Councillors are  
 elected for a term of three years.They
 belong to one of two political parties
 Labour or Conservative.The Labour     
 Party have the majority at the moment,
 so they hold the power.The various    
 departments like Housing and Education
 carry out the instructions of the     
 committees of councillors.They are run
 by paid officials and people are      
 employed to carry out the work.The    
 money to pay for this comes from local
 rates and a grant from Central        
 Government.The full council meetings  
 are chaired by the Lord Mayor who is  
 elected each year as the leading      
 citizen who also performs many civic  
 duties representing the City of       
 Coventry.                             </content>
