		<content> MRS COOPER, A FRESHWATER HOTELIER     
                                       
 Mrs Cooper runs a hotel.  She has got 
 8 people to help her.  There are 13   
 bedrooms.  The hotel has also got a   
 bar.  Mrs Cooper told us that the time
 she does the most business is in the  
 summer.  The guests usually have      
 dinner in the dining room unless they 
 are ill then they have it in their    
 rooms.  The hotel has 4 waiters.  The 
 guests usually book their rooms, but  
 some just come on the off chance.  Mrs
 Cooper has been running the hotel for 
 six years.  Before they bought the    
 hotel it was just an ordinary house.  
 The hotel is in the country, not near 
 the road.  It has 1 acre of ground.   
 The house was built in 1856.  The     
 hotel has three sea horse awards -    
 which shows that it is a very good    
 hotel.                                </content>
