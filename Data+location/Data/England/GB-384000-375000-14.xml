		<title>14LEGEND OF THE WIZARD</title>
		<content> A farmer from Mobberley was taking his
 horse to sell at Macclesfield. When he
 got to the top of the Edge a strange  
 man offered to buy the horse but the  
 farmer refused. The stranger said     
 "No-one will buy your horse" At the   
 Macclesfield market no one did want to
 buy the horse and on the farmers way  
 home the Wizard appeared again and    
 said "Come with me" He led the farmer 
 to some rocks. He struck them with his
 staff. The rocks opened to show a cave
 with some iron gates at the entrance. 
 Down in the cave  were some men asleep
 with white horses at their sides.     
 There was one horse missing. The      
 wizard said "Whenever the country     
 needs their help they will awake and  
 ride to battle to save their country".
 The wizard disappeard as the rocks    
 closed.                               
                                       </content>
