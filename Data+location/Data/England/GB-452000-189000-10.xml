		<title>10A DAY IN THE LIFE</title>
		<content>My name is Emma Lewis and I am 11 years
old.  At 7.30 my dad wakes me up.  I go
to the bathroom and wash.  I get       
dressed and go downstairs to help lay  
the table.  One of my morning jobs is  
sweeping the garage.  After this I eat 
my breakfast, then clean my teeth.     
Until 8.30 I read the paper.  Then I   
call for my friends and we go to       
school.  We have assembly after the    
register is called.  Then we work until
playtime.  Then more work till dinner. 
In the afternoon we do some project    
work until we go home.  I walk home and
have my tea.  After my tea I go outside
and play.  I come in and watch some    
T.V.  Today I watched a programme      
called "Allo,Allo" on the video.  My   
dad had recorded it on Monday.  After  
that I go upstairs to practise on my   
organ.  I read for a while then I go to
bed.                                   </content>
