		<content> An area of undulating sandy soil,     
 predominatly of agricultural use,     
 though with scattered areas of mostly 
 deciduous woodland.   Necton Common is
 one, where we found a few cattle      
 grazing.   Some few dozen sheep &amp;     
 pigs; &amp; also a riding stables.        
 Bradenham and Holme Hale have both    
 ancient churches &amp; houses indicating  
 lengthy settlement and modern         
 developments, cheaper housing has     
 attracted many retired people, Holme  
 Hale having but 12 working out of 400 
 population.   Some villagers work on  
 farms or allied trades like machine   
 maintenance &amp; lorry driving; others   
 travel up to 25 miles to work in local
 towns.   Bradenham boasts a Primary   
 School - Holme Hale's closed July     
 1985.   Older children travel to      
 Swaffam and King's Lynn.   There are  
 bus services to local towns usually   </content>
