		<content>  In Ebchester there is a lot of {     
{wildlife }but if we don't preserve it,
 it will all die.The{department of the 
{environment}keeps check on the river  
 to make sure factories aren't just    
 dumping chemicals into the river.The{ 
{R.S.P.B.}looks after all of the birds 
 and makes sure that one species isn't 
 killing off another species of birds.I
 can't imagine the world without trees 
 so the{department of the environment} 
 looks after them too.We have a couple 
 of{Herons}and {Mallards}in our        
 river,I have spotted them on several  
 occasions.We are very lucky to live in
 such a nice village.
