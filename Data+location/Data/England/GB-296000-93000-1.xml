		<title>01VALLEY OF THE RIVER CLYST</title>
		<content>  This part of {East Devon }has been   
 greatly influenced by the {River Clyst
 which is a tributary of the{River Exe.
 At this part of its course,the Clyst  
 is for most of the year,an apparently 
 insignificant stream with some pools  
 which afford the opportunity for local
 children to swim.In winter the water  
 level rises dramatically and can flood
 a wide area of farmland and affect    
 some roads  as the area is so flat and
 low lying.                            
      The centres of population are  at
{West Clyst, Clyst Honiton }and  the   
 village of{Pinhoe,}which, though it   
 retains its identity, has become a    
 suburb of {Exeter,}where most of the  
 inhabitants of this area are employed.
