		<title>03Roman Wall</title>
		<content>   The northern section of our area is 
 in the Northumberland National Park   
 and contains some fine sections of the
 Roman Wall.  Apart from local farmers 
 using it as a convenient source of    
 stone for building, it has been left  
 undisturbed through the years and is  
 now protected so that visitors can    
 enjoy its forts and milecastles.      
   Less than a mile to the west is the 
 Roman Army Museum at Carvoran fort and
 a few miles to the east are the forts 
 of Vindolanda and Housesteads which   
 both have interesting museums to visit
 and excavations to watch.             
   In the summer months many tourists  
 stay in and around Haltwhistle, which 
 helps our shops, hotels and bed and   
 breakfast concerns remain profitable. 
 This provides another source of       
 employment in our area.
