		<title>10ASHDOWN FOREST MOTORISTS</title>
		<content> A survey taken in the car-parks on a  
 typical summer Sunday afternoon showed
 that this part of the Forest is       
 popular for outings from towns within 
 about an hour's drive. The young and  
 the old seem to enjoy it most.        
 Families with children and dogs came  
 mainly to walk, perhaps with some     
 special purpose such as studying      
 plants and insects, flying kites or   
 photography. Elderly and sometimes    
 infirm people preferred to sit in or  
 beside their cars and admire the      
 panoramic and beautiful views. In fine
 weather there are picnics but fires   
 and camping are not allowed. Some     
 people had brought friends from       
 further away for whom this was a first
 visit but 25% of those questioned said
 they came most weeks and almost all   
 had been a number of times before.
