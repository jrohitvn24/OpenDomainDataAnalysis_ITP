		<title>12HOUSING  IN PENDLESIDE</title>
		<content> At the time of the{last census (1981) 
{there were approx. 250 households,}70 
 of which had at least one pensioner,34
 had children aged from 0-17.          
 About{70% of the properties were      
{owner-occupied, 20% were rented}and   
 the remainder  were  either linked to 
 employment or Council-owned.{Most of  
{the houses are old (some over 200     
{years)}stone-built cottages or farms. 
 Whitehough Farm is dated 1593,and     
 Sabden Hall 1577.{During the past     
{12-15years some new houses have been  
{built,}attracting business and        
 professional people to live in the    
 area,but whose work takes them else-  
 where.{95% of households had inside   
{W.C. and bath,}but 5% lacked indoor   
 W.C.-mainly outlying farms or cottages
 with no access to mains drainage.The  
 situation remains much the same today.
