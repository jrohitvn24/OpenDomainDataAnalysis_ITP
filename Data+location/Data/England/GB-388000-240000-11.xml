		<content>{DUNSTALL CASTLE                      }
 The 'Castle' stands on Dunstall Common
 It is a sham Norman ruin, built to be 
 viewed from Croome Court in 1769 by   
 the sixth Earl of Coventry and        
 designed by Adam. It consists of two  
 round towers with a high archway      
 between them. At an angle from one    
 tower, a wall leads to a trefoil      
 -cusped archway and a thin square     
 tower.                                
                                       
{THE TOWER HOUSE.                     }
 The octagonal Tower House, built circa
 1750, was originally owned by the     
 Coventry family as a hunting lodge and
 'look out' to enable servants to warn 
 Croome Court of the approach of       
 coaches. Today it is used as a private
 dwelling and has magnificent views of 
 the surrounding countryside.
