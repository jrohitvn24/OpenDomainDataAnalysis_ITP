		<title>14KENTISH RAGSTONE</title>
		<content> It is impossible to walk around       
 Boughton Monchelsea and Loose without 
 noticing the buildings and walls of   
 Kentish ragstone. This hard grey      
 limestone is drawn from the geological
 formation known as the Hythe Beds of  
 the Lower Greensand, and for centuries
 it has been quarried for use both     
 locally and further afield. The Roman 
 walled cemetery at Boughton used it.  
 In Norman times it was employed in the
 building of London's White Tower and  
 Westminster Abbey; a royal command    
 decreed that "no Kentish Ragstone     
 shall be carted to London for any     
 other purpose until the Abbey is      
 built". Rochester Castle was repaired 
 with it and in 1419 Henry V ordered   
 7000 stone cannon-balls from the      
 quarries here. Many of Maidstone's    
 public buildings are of ragstone, but 
 none is quarried now in this area.    </content>
