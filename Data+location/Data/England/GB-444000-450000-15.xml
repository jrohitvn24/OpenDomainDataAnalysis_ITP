		<content>   When I go to{Youth Club}I pay 10p   
 and then meet my friends. Sometimes we
 have a game of tig. It's good fun     
 because we go up the tree and on the  
 shed. One week we did dares and I went
 through Youth Club on my bike. Next   
 week we are going swimming.           
   There is a big hall where we play   
 games and sometimes I get into the    
 final and win. All the 14 year olds   
 play on their BMX bikes trying new    
 tricks. We have a pool table and an   
 electronic game. The best game is load
 and chase at which I can beat Chris   
 Hall who is one of the best. In the   
 disco the girls wait for their boy    
 friends or try to get one!            
   At the back there is a yard where we
 play tig. At 8 o'clock we all go home.
   The Youth Club meets on Tuesday and 
 Friday.
