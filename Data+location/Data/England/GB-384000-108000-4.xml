 at playtime at Durweston First School.

{ Chase:}run away and someone catches  
 you and puts you in jail which is     
 anywhere, until someone frees you.    
{ Stuck in mud:}if you are caught you  
 open your legs and someone goes       
 through.                              
{ Knives,forks,spoons:}someone calls a 
 special call and you do a handstand.  
{ Buzzy Bee:}you have run to the       
 middle to get honey. And not get      
 caught.                               
{ Hopscotch:}throw a stone to a number 
 marked on the pitch and hop to that   
 number. Then you pick up the stone and
 hop back to the beginning.            
{ Tyre game:}people stand on the       
 outside of the tyre. Someone pushes   
 you inside the tyre and then you      
 are on it.                            </content>
