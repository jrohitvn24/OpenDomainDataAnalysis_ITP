		<title>02THE GROWTH OF CARLISLE</title>
		<content> Carlisle stands on high ground between
 the River Eden and a plain.There are  
 signs of ancient settlements here.Car-
 lisle's centre is on the site of the  
 Roman city near Hadrian's Wall.This   
 became the medieval walled city with  
 its castle,cathedral and gates.The    
 city did not grow much beyond its     
 walls until the 18th century because  
 of wars with Scotland.Real growth came
 with the arrival of industry and the  
 railway.In the 19th century an        
 industrial area grew up to the West   
 &lt;p.7>while housing spread in all dir- 
 ections except the North.The main     
 developments North of the river have  
 been in the 20th century.All outer    
 areas of the city now have modern     
 suburbs:in this block they are seen in
 the North and West&lt;p.8-18>.Older      
 villages still keep some character as 
 the town surrounds them.              </content>
