		<content>{ LUMLEY WATER TREATMENT PLANT.        
 Worked totally by computer, Wear water
 is pumped through  a giant pipe to the
 Treatment Plant.The beautiful foyer of
 the works  houses working models,  and
 the main controls.The water is treated
 by chemicals,chiefly ferrous sulphate,
 sulphuric acid,or lime,sulphur dioxide
 and carbon. The  water  passes through
 flash  mixers  then  to  clarification
 tanks.   After  filtration, the  final
 treated water is chlorinated and piped
 via the Stoneygate Reservoir to  South
 Tyneside and Washington.A minicomputer
 controls a direct telemetry link  with
 the  Intake Works  and the  Monitoring
 Station further upstream. The plant is
 manned round the clock by a maximum of
 eight people, minimum one!  Output  of
 water is  monitored  by the  Company's
 Control System.Design is  spacious for
 future extension.      {S.Gilroy.     </content>
