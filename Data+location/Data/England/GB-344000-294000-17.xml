		<title>17HISTORY OF STRETTON SCHOOLS</title>
		<content>   Church Stretton's old school used to
 be where the library is now. It was   
 built in{1860}and opened in{1861.}It  
 cost Â£1055 to build.                  
   In{1940}all the infants aged from   
 five to seven moved to the parish hall
 because of lack of space in the       
 existing building.                    
   In{1948}Hope Bowdler school and     
 Acton Scott school closed down,       
 considerably increasing numbers at    
 Church Stretton.                      
   Then the children over ten (the     
 seniors) were moved to the St.        
 Dunstan's huts in Essex Road.         
   In{1960}the new Secondary Modern    
 opened up in Shrewsbury Road for the  
 seniors.                              
   In{1968}the old school closed. The  
 children moved to a new primary school
 (our school) in Shrewsbury Road which 
 was opened on{May 7th 1968.           </content>
