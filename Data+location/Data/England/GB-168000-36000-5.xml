 One of our concerns is that the       
 village has not got a village hall. It
 has a church hall but this is quite   
 small, it is very near to the main    
 road so is noisy and dangerous.Until  
 last year it was very cold in there we
 hope it will be better now. Each year 
 the village held a Gala,there were    
 different activities e.g. Gala Queen, 
 Fairy Queen, dog show, disco. A large 
 marquee was erected for the weeks     
 events and on the Saturday a show of  
 crafts, flowers, vegetables, cakes,   
 plants and hundreds of entries from   
 the village school. Unfortunatly this 
 has stopped this year (1985) due to   
 lack of response from the             
 villagers.Instead we have a Carnival.
