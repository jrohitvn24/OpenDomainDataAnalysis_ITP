		<title>16PUBLIC HOUSES (PUBS)</title>
		<content> One of the pubs in our survey was a   
 free house. This means that it could  
 sell several different makes and types
 of beer. You can have stout, lager,   
 cider, bitter or mild. All these are  
 sold in pint or half pint glasses.    
 Some glasses have straight sides and  
 plain glass and others have patterns  
 on and they have handles.             
 Beer can be any colour from pale      
 yellow to very dark brown. Some beers 
 have froth on the top and it is called
 a head. The place where beer is made  
 is called a brewery. There are small  
 breweries and big breweries. When beer
 is delivered to the pub it comes in   
 barrels. The big breweries have metal 
 barrels called kegs, and the small    
 breweries have wooden barrels. To get 
 the beer into your glass from the     
 barrels the pub has pumps. Some are   
 worked by hand.                       </content>
