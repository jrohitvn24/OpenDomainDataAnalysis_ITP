		<content> The agricultural land is well-cared   
 for an in good heart. Footpaths and   
 bridle-paths are well-signposted and  
 accessible to hikers, riders and      
 anyone interested in the natural      
 history of the area.                  
 The flora associaed with chalky soil  
 and woodland survives in abundance    
 despite modern methods of weed control
 and includes large colonies f the     
 disappearing cowslip.                 
 The woodland provides cover for the   
 deer which are culled but no longer   
 hunted. Smaller mammals such as fox   
 and badger thrive.                    
 Pheasants are reared on the edge of   
 many of the woods and frequent shoots 
 are held during the open season.      
 Rough shooting is popular as a method 
 of controlling the large numbers of   
 rabbits.
