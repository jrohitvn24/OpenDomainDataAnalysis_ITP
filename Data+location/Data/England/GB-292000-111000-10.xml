		<title>10Visit to farm near Tiverton</title>
		<content>   A group went to interview a farmer's
 wife at Mogridge Farm on Seven Crosses
 Hill.  This is shown on Photograph B. 
 Mrs Jarrett gave some information     
 about the surrounding farms.  She said
 that some were mixed involving Beef   
 and Sheep.  Others concentrated on    
 rearing pigs.  Most had some Dairy    
 produce but new EEC quotas were making
 it hard to get a fair profit from     
 this.  She said she could not give us 
 a land price for the whole area as the
 land differed so much from place to   
 place.  On average she guessed that it
 sold for about 2,000 pounds per acre. 
 This was too much for small farmers to
 pay.
