		<title>01Sandringham and West Newton</title>
		<content> Until 1862, this area was typical of  
 the rural Norfolk which existed then  
 and to a large extent now: a small    
 village with its accompanying hamlets 
 relying for work on the local landlord
 who needed agricultural workers in    
 order to farm his estate. Since then, 
 with the aquisition of the Sandringham
 Estate by The Royal Family, the area  
 has gained an identity peculiar to    
 itself. The visitor will notice       
 immediately how well buildings and    
 gardens are kept and the general      
 feeling of well-being that permeates  
 the atmosphere. For while still       
 being the place where the estate      
 workers live, it contains three       
 generations who have lived in a 'Royal
 Village. The people who live here are 
 indeed special themselves: friendly to
 the many annual visitors and very     
 loyal to The Queen.                   </content>
