 of Maghull and Melling both occupy    
 sandstone outcrops standing out from  
 the clay plains below.                
   The towns are still independant and 
 thriving set amongs farmlands of the  
 Lancashire plain.   The area is well  
 connected by road, motorway, railway  
 and canal.   A population of about
