		<title>17NESTON PLAYGROUND GAMES</title>
		<content> What else can I see? Ahaaa! That's a  
 good game those children are playing  
 in the corner.It's called 3 Bad Eggs. 
 No it isn't a bad smell, it is        
 actually a game using a ball.What you 
 have to do is choose one person to be 
 on and the rest of you line up against
 the wall.The person who is on, whom we
 shall call A, chooses a subject.Let's 
 say our subject is 'trees'.The people 
 by the wall have to choose a name of a
 tree and also choose one for A.One    
 person shouts them out and A has to   
 pick one.Say there was fir, beech, oak
 and elm and he picked elm.He would    
 shout it out and throw the ball up in 
 the air.Whoever is elm catches the    
 ball and shouts stop.Then he takes    
 three strides and has to throw the    
 ball at someone.If he hits that person
 he is alright but if he misses he gets
 one bad egg.      P.T.O.              </content>
