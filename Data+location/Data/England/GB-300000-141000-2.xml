   These happenings occur frequen-     
 tly. Other people from the same       
 village have had different expe-      
 riences, another family said that     
 at night time they can hear foot-     
 steps that appear to be walking       
 up and down the stairs.               
  The worst happening was by the       
 Blanchard family.Early one morn-      
 ing when, Mrs Blanchard got up        
 to cook Mr Blanchards breakfast       
 she opened the cutlary drawer;  to    
 her amazement, a bread knife fl-      
 ew out of the drawer, across the      
 room and fell with a crash into       
 the sink,Mrs Blanchard could not      
 believe her eyes.                     
   Luckily no one has been injured     
 so far.People still have these        
 occurances regularly.                 </content>
