		<title>13Living In Cherry Hinton</title>
		<content> I live in Cherry Hinton.Cherry Hinton 
 got its name from the Cherry trees    
 which we have by the bus stop,and     
 Hinton from a family who lived there  
 years ago.Cherry Hinton is quite a    
 large village.It has an Infant and a  
 Junior school and also a Primary      
 school.There are about 6 or 7 bus     
 stops.You can catch the bus into town 
 but you can get most things in Cherry 
 Hinton village.We have a good         
 selection of shops,including a clothes
 shop and a shoe shop.                 
    I don't like the railway being     
 right in the middle of the            
 village,because it's so noisy and the 
 people who do the gates close them too
 soon and we have to wait about five   
 minutes.On Sundays it's always quiet  
 and not as busy.There are several     
 parks to visit and the largest is     
 Cherry Hinton Hall.                   </content>
