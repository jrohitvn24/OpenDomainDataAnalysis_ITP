		<content> Mr Graham Whitcroft is vicar at St    
 Johns Green. He is 47 years old and   
 has been vicar for 13 years. Mr       
 Whitcroft said all his days are busy. 
 He gets up at 6 o'clock everyday to   
 meet his curate at church.            
 Today, Wednesday May 15th, Mr         
 Whitcroft gave a speech at            
 Greasborough Church about visiting    
 sick people. Then he picked his       
 children up from school, took the dog 
 for a walk and had his dinner. He went
 to church to pray with the curate and 
 then saw 5 ladies about a barbecue. He
 saw Mrs Hardy about a problem child   
 and a lady whose mother had died. Then
 he came home for tea and watched the  
 news. After seeing another lady he got
 home at 9.15pm.                       
 He earns 250 pounds a month. He once  
 forgot a funeral and booked 2 weddings
 for the same time.                    </content>
