		<title>08A SCHOOL DAY IN A-IN-M</title>
		<content> I live at 33, Skelton Street, Bryn.   
 I get up at 7.15 am to go to school.  
 I set out from home at 8.20 am and    
 arrive at school at about 8.35 am.    
 Our school is split into two          
 blocks an old block where all the     
 first and second years are and a new  
 block where all the third, fourth and 
 fifth years are. Also there is a big  
 leisure centre.                       
                                       
 We have different lessons in different
 blocks.  We have a break at 10.35 am  
 which ends at 10.50 am and then it's  
 dinner at 12 noon, which ends at 1.00 
 pm and then another break at 2.20 pm  
 which ends at 2.35 pm. School finishes
 at 3.45 pm. When I get home I change  
 out of my uniform into different      
 clothes.Then I do my homework,then I  
 go out to play football.
