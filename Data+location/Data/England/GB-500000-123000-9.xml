		<title>09TRANSPORT, PETWORTH RURAL NE</title>
		<content> For transport, cars and landrovers are
 depended upon, with bicycles for local
 trips. The nearest public buses are at
 either Kirdford or Wisborough Green,  
 connecting with Billingshurst or      
 Petworth. One or two cars per         
 household is usual but, where there   
 are adult children such as at         
 Bulchins, there may be one for each!  
 The easily accessible main road, A272,
 runs westward to Petworth, east to    
 Billingshurst. Cars are essential, not
 only for social calls, but for bulk   
 shopping to stock the freezer, or for 
 wives who have part-time jobs in the  
 villages or towns. The nearest railway
 stations are at Pulborough and        
 Billingshurst. Fortunately for the    
 peace and tranquility of the district,
 no air lane passes over this area.
