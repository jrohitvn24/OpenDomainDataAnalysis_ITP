		<title>07THE LEEDS/LIVERPOOL CANAL</title>
		<content>      The canal is different from      
 rivers or lakes because it is         
 man-made. It was built to carry goods 
 because the roads were dangerous and  
 bumpy. The Leeds/Liverpool Canal is   
 127 miles long, there are 84 locks and
 594 bridges.                          
      Mills were very often built along
 the banks of the canal. In Blackburn  
 the mills were built here so that the 
 cotton manufactured could easily be   
 loaded on to the barges and exported. 
 It was quicker for goods to travel by 
 barge because the canals were built in
 a straight line and were smoother than
 the roads.                            
      Today, in Blackburn, the canal is
 only used by pleasure craft. Many old 
 barges have been converted into house 
 boats for use at weekends and during  
 holidays.
