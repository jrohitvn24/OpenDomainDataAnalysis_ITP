		<title>09FARM OWNERSHIP - WILLOUGHBY</title>
		<content> MOST OF THE FARM OWNERS HAVE HAD THE  
 FARM PASSED DOWN TO THEM BY THEIR     
 PARENTS. THEY HAVE ALL OWNED THE FARM 
 FOR MORE THAN 25 YEARS AND THE AVERAGE
 SIZE OF THE FARMS IS ABOUT 100 ACRES  
 APART FROM A COUPLE WHICH HAVE 160    
 ACRES. THE PRICE OF FARMS HAS ROUGHLY 
 DOUBLED OVER A SPACE OF 10 YEARS.     
 ONE OF THE  FARMS LETS PEOPLE GO      
 FISHING ON THEIR SMALL POND WHICH THEY
 OWN.                                  
                                       
 MOST OF THE FARMS IN WILLOUGHBY ARE UP
 A DISUSED TRACK WHICH RUNS TO         
 GILMORTON. THIS USED TO BE THE OLD    
 MARKET CATTLE TRACK YEARS AGO.        
                                       
 WILLOUGHBY FARMERS ARE VERY FRIENDLY  
 AND HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH EACH
 OTHER.
