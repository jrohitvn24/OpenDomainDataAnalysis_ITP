		<content> The A38 is the main road serving      
 Plymouth from the rest of the country.
 This road meets the large Marsh Mills 
 roundabout, where traffic can either  
 go to the city or its suburbs, or can 
 join the new Parkway, which is a new  
 inner city through road. The Parkway  
 was opened on April 1st 1985, and runs
 from the Tamar Bridge to the Marsh    
 Mills roundabout. A peak hour census  
 taken on a July Saturday showed nearly
 3,000 vehicles per hour using this    
 roundabout. The bridge over the River 
 Plym on the A38 is suffering from     
 concrete cancer and will need to be   
 repaired in a few years. All the local
 people want to see a new flyover road 
 replace this bridge and join the A38  
 to the Parkway over the Marsh Mills   
 roundabout.
