		<content>    Elham School set out forms asking  
 questions about families. On a graph, 
 we recorded who went out of the       
 village to work. Quite a few people   
 did. Some people worked in the village
 and had self-employed jobs.           
    Many people worked in Canterbury,  
 less worked in Folkestone, then came  
 Hythe, Ashford and lastly Dungerness  
 and Deal.                             
    In 1980 the villagers made a survey
 of who went out of the village to     
 work.{27% worked around Elham         
      {26% Folkestone/Hythe            
      {11% Canterbury                  
      {8%  Ashford                     
      {7%  London                      
      {6%  Dover                       
      {5%  Local villages              
      {3%  Other parts of Kent         
 It appears in 1985, that more people  
 work in{Canterbury.                   </content>
