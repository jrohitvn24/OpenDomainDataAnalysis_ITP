		<title>04Manor Farm Fire</title>
		<content>   Fire destroyed the 17th Century     
 thatched house at Manor Farm Activity 
 Centre early on May 18th 1985 when an 
 electrical fault set light to the     
 attic.                                
   Barking dogs raised the alarm and   
 the ten occupants escaped unharmed.   
 There were no holiday makers in       
 residence.Seven fire engines fought   
 the fire with water from the Centre's 
 swimming pool and the river Brue.     
   Sqdn Ldr Gilchrist lost his flight  
 log books and favourite photographs   
 but much of the ground floor furniture
 was saved.The visitors dormitory block
 was undamaged and courses continue as 
 usual.                                
   It is hoped to rebuild the house by 
 Christmas,this time preferably with a 
 tiled roof if the planning authorities
 agree.                                
                                       </content>
