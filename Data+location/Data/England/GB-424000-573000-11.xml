 Seaton Burn is quite a nice village,  
but sometimes quite boring.Near the    
top of Seaton Burn there is a          
recreation ground.You can play tennis  
football,rounders,golf but mainly      
cricket. Nearly every night Seaton     
Burn plays a cricket match.We also     
have  a junior cricket team, and most  
of the players come from local schools 
There are four pubs in Seaton Burn,the 
the Moor House,the Social Club,the Six 
Mile Inn and opposite the recreation   
ground is the Drift Inn.Opposite my    
estate is the High School.I go to this 
school and I enjoy it. People could    
improve Seaton Burn by having more     
youth clubs. I live in Fordley which is
between Annitsford and Dudley.There are
three parks two of which are welfares.
