		<title>11Fishing on the River Avon</title>
		<content>   The fishing on the River Avon, a    
 chalk stream, is privately owned by   
 Mr Angus of Bulford and The Services  
 Dry Fly Fishing Association.Mr Angus  
 and the S.D.F.F.stock the river with  
 trout.Fly fishing is the only         
 technique allowed, predominantly dry  
 fly, but up stream nymphing is allowed
 at times during the season.The season 
 begins in April when iron blues and   
 olives are the flies used.In May the  
 whole river comes alive with mayfly   
 and this is the best artificial fly.In
 October the season ends and electro   
 fishing is used to remove predators   
 like pike. If left to its own devices 
 the river would revert to a coarse    
 stream,so weed is cut in April and    
 June. People pay up to Â£300 a season  
 to fish this stretch of the Avon.     
 Poaching, mainly by children is a     
 serious problem.                      </content>
