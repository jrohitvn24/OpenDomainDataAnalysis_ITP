		<content> This occupies about 1700 acres to the 
 west of West Tytherley Village, and is
 known to have existed before 1200A.D. 
 The original name for Tytherley means 
 young wood.(Domesday Book).Recently   
 the wood has been bought from the     
 Forestry Commission by the Estate of  
 the late Lady Coleman of Middleton    
 Manor,Winterslow.A trust manages it   
 for the benefit of wildlife and local 
 people.It is designated a conservation
 area.A plan is to reduce substancially
 vast numbers of coniferous trees and  
 re-plant with deciduous. Wildlife     
 includes the sika deer introduced by  
 the Washington Singer family at Norman
 Court before World War 1.Birds include
 the nightingale,tree pippit,woodcock, 
 woodpeckers,pheasant,partridge and    
 barn owl.The area is managed but open
