		<content> Agriculture is the major use of land, 
 and the major source of employment in 
 the area. Dairy, sheep and arable     
 farming exist side-by-side. Dairy     
 herds are mainly Friesan but Fields   
 Farm has Friesan/Holstein cross, which
 are valuable prizewinning cattle.     
 Sheep graze on the hillsides in large 
 numbers. Although much of the rough   
 pasture land remains, some has been   
 reclaimed for the growing of cereals. 
 With the shortage of manpower a large 
 number of agricultural vehicles are   
 used. Distances of fields from the    
 farm are such that Citizens Band      
 Radios are used for quick contact.    
 Crops are sown in a four year rotation
 of winter wheat, barley, spring       
 barley, grass, kale then re-seeding.  
 Turnips and maize are also grown.
