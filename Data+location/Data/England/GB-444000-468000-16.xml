		<title>16MACHINES AND THE PEACOCKS</title>
		<content>{                                      
{Mr Peacock finds it hard to repair    
{machines on his own but tells us that 
{it is 60% cheaper than sending them to
{a mechanic.                           
{  Today the machines cost about Â£28000
{but with discount he can buy them for 
{Â£21000. When he started in l968 they  
{were only about Â£3800. This is a very 
{good reason why Mr Peacock never buys 
{them new, only secondhand.            
{  Mrs Peacock does all the paperwork  
{and all the accounts because the more 
{she does the less thay have to pay for
{the services of an accountant. Every  
{year there becomes more to do.        
{  Mr Peacock told us that there was no
{future for the business in this area  
{because there are too many already    
{employed in this line of work. If they
{did have to sell up they would choose 
{to emigrate to Australia. }           </content>
