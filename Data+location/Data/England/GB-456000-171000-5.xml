		<content> The church of{St Denys}in{Stanford    
{Dingley}is one of the oldest in       
 Berkshire. It was originally a{Saxon  
 church before the Norman Conquest.    
 Parts of the original Saxon masonry   
 have been incorporated into the walls.
 Most of the church was built a little 
 before and after 1200 A.D. The church 
 now contains arches, beams and        
 supports. Some restoration took place 
 during the 19th century, but only a   
 few additions were made. In outward   
 form, the church, which is dedicated  
 to St Denys ( not frequently          
 remembered in church names ), looks   
 much the same as in an early Victorian
 watercolour. The gravestones provide  
 an interesting insight into some of   
 the village's inhabitants' past       
 activities and the frequent occurrence
 of premature mortality before the     
 start of the 20th century.            </content>
