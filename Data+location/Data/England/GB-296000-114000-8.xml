		<content>     On the farm I mainly help with    
 the cows and renew old gate posts with
 new ones. I help move the the bullocks
 from field to field. I very often dig 
 ditches to help the water run away so 
 the gateways don't collect too much   
 mud and stop the tractors from going  
 in and out.                           
     When it is time to cut hay and    
 straw I help cut and store it. In the 
 winter I help bed up the cows.On the  
 farm they have a bull. It is only     
 young so it is quite dangerous.       
 Sometimes I spread dung to fertilise  
 the fields.                           
     On Sunday afternoons we often walk
 through what is called the Rifle      
 Range.During the war the Americans    
 used to practice shooting big         
 shells.There's a field at the top of  
 the farm which has big holes (dips)   
 which those shells made.              </content>
