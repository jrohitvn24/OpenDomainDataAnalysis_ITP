		<content>    On several days in 1984 one or two 
 dazzling,white boats could be seen    
 bobbing about in Fistral Bay.They must
 have done well because the local paper
 reported that Mr Treblock netted two  
 tons of bass in two days,worth about  
 Â£9000.Crew worked from seven in the   
 morning till midnight on both days to 
 bring the bass ashore.They had caught 
 140 stone of hake that week,so it was 
 all very worthwhile                   
                                       
    The main type of fishing in the    
 winter months is trawling,although    
 only about two boats operate all      
 winter long. The main type of fish    
 caught is Blond Ray,although a trawl  
 net may contain anything from turbot  
 to huss. The fish are taken to Newlyn 
 or the Fishermen's cooperative at     
 Bodmin.The fish are bought by agents  
 who then send it to Billingsgate.     </content>
