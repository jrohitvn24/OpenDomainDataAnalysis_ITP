		<title>12WASTE COPPICE,STOURPORT</title>
		<content>  This gets its name from the time of  
 the Middle Ages when only wood was    
 used for fires. They  cut trees to a  
 certain level as they were growing so 
 that the branches would grow again and
 again. This was repeated over and over
 each year and is called coppicing.    
  The people of the time were allowed  
 to pick up the waste wood to use on   
 their fires.
