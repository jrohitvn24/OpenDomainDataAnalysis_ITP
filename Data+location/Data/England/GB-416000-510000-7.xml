		<content>   This is a rural, highly mechanised, 
 intensive agricultural area. Cereal   
 and root crops predominate but a large
 proportion of the land is pasture for 
 dairy and beef cattle and sheep. There
 are also some intensive calf and      
 poultry rearing units. The cereals are
 wheat and barley and the main root    
 crop being potatoes together with     
 small acreages of peas and turnips.   
                                       
   Most of the farms exceed 200 acres  
 and are almost self-sufficient in that
 very little feedstuffs have to be     
 bought in for the livestock and       
 virtually no contract hiring of extra 
 machinery is necessary. The only      
 additional labour that is now required
 are gangs of potato pickers in late   
 September / early October.
