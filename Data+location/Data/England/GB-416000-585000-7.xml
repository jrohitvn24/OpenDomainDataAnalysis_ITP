		<title>07     MORPETH CHANTRY</title>
		<content>   In the 13th century{John de         
{Greystock}established a{CHANTRY}where 
 prayers would be said for himself and 
 his family.The chantry priests        
 received alms from travellers for the 
 upkeep of a{bridge}and{school.}The    
 chantry was dissolved by Henry VIII   
 but the{Grammar School}was allowed to 
 continue and was given a{Charter}by{  
{Edward VI.}The school remained in the 
 Chantry until 1846 when it moved to   
 Cottingwood Lane.The bridge, having   
 become dangerous, was blown up in 1834
 and replaced by the{Telford}Road      
 Bridge but the remaining central pier 
 and two buttresses were later used to 
 support the iron{Swinney}Bridge.The   
 recently restored{CHANTRY}now houses  
 display and conference halls and the{ 
{Tourist Information}and{Wildlife Trust
  centres.
