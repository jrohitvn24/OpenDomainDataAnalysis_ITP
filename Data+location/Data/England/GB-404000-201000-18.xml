		<content>  Recently the most important event has
 been the annual fete in aid of church 
 and Village Hall. It takes place in   
 the grounds of Ampney House with a    
 bottle stall, dog show, cake stalls   
 and other attractions. The 250th      
 anniversary of the school was a great 
 event with a lunch party for all      
 people associated with the school     
 including the Bishop of Gloucester.   
 The opening of the cricket pavilion in
 1969, and in 1979 the winning of the  
 Lord Oaksey Bowl following a hat-trick
 by Mr Gearing in the final part of the
 match were things to remember.        
  The biggest event of recent years was
 a dance and barbecue in the grain     
 dryer to celebrate The Queen's Silver 
 Jubilee. People flocked to a jolly    
 evening from miles around.            
  A barbecue and lamb roast will be    
 held on August 24th this year.        </content>
