		<content> Many of the children travelling to    
 school in Wooler come from small set- 
 tlements scattered around the country-
 side.Humbleton is such a place,one    
 mile north of Wooler.It is now almost 
 a deserted village with only seven    
 houses but it was at one time a consi-
 derable settlement around a triangular
 village green.The green is now covered
 by the remains of  duck pond.The vill-
 age began to die when the lands of the
 small free-holders began to be gradua-
 lly absorbed by the the larger land   
 owners.                               
   To the west of the village is Humbl-
 eton Hill,on top of which is a prehis-
 toric camp.Below this there is eviden-
 ce of three tiers of lynchets or cult-
 ivation terraces.All round the lower  
 slopes are the remains of hut circles,
 cattle folds and oval tombs.
