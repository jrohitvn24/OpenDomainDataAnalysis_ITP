		<content> THE BROWNIE HUT                       
 The Brownies didn't have a meeting    
 place until the hut was built. The hut
 is four years old and Mr. Woodford    
 opened it. Mr. Woodford is the most   
 important person who has visited the  
 hut. At the hut there have only been  
 little accidents; like when Lizby Jane
 got an earring stuck in her foot. The 
 hut is also used for grown ups'       
 meetings.
