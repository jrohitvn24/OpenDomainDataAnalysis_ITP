		<content> seeker  sees a child he has to run to 
 a designated post, touch it and shout 
 "Blocky 1.2.3.", the person's name and
 where they are hiding. They then have 
 to help find the others.              
{Creep Mouse.}Someone stands with their
 back to the children as they try to   
 creep up to them but if they are seen 
 they go back to the beginning.        
{Off Ground Touch.}This is played with 
 any number of players. Someone is on  
 it and if you are touched on normal   
 ground level you are on it and the    
 other person is not.                  
{Budge}is like Off Ground Touch, one   
 person is on it and the others find a 
 place off the ground. One person per  
 site. When you go to someone elses    
 place you must say "Budge" and they   
 have to move to another perch without 
 getting touched.
