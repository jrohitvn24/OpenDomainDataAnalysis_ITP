   The {vicarage }has  been there since
 1445, next door to the Manor House. It
 was built on the site of an old walnut
 yard.                                 
   The{URC Chapel}was built in{1700 }to
 serve as a  congregational  church. It
 was{sold}to the university in 1983 and
 is now a lecture and  concert hall. It
 is called the Radcliffe Centre.

 used by this  society.  The  Jehovah's
 Witnesses meet in the hall on Sundays,
 Tuesdays and Thursdays.
