		<content>  The first club,{The Institute,}was   
 built in{Church Road}for Â£1000 in     
 1923. Two adjoining houses were bought
 and converted for the clubhouses.Other
 land was acquired and laid out for    
 sport - soccer,cricket,bowls and      
 tennis, and the{Pavilion}was built.   
  Some of the farmland was sold and the
{Wiclif Way}housing estate was built on
 it.                                   
  Today 285 plots are still cultivated 
 though it can take years to obtain a  
 plot. During the{1926 strike}Â£700 was 
 paid out in food vouchers, the        
 membership then being 2,000.          
  In recent times membership has been  
 frozen at 4,500. With the coming of   
 bigger buildings it has been opened   
 again with an average 100 applications
 per fortnight.
