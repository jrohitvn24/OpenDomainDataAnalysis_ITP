		<content>    Our school is{Wharton Junior       
{School.}It was built in 1848 and is   
 situated in School Road.{Queen        
{Victoria}helped to pay for the school 
 which cost Â£1300 and took one year to 
 build.                                
    Over the years there have been many
 headmasters and headmistresses.       
    Originally our school was three    
 schools,a boys',a girls'and a primary.
    There is a house opposite the      
 school which was the headteacher's    
 house.It is no longer used for this   
 purpose.                              
    The school has changed a lot.There 
 were no lights when it was first      
 built.The school would be dark because
 the windows were small.The toilets    
 were outside in a corner of the       
 playground.The children would have    
 written on slates.
