 one of the highest villages in        
 Hampshire off the Old Harrow Way      
 situated approximately five miles from
 Basingstoke.                          
 Originally a farming community, the   
 village has become more of a dormitory
 for Basingstoke and even London.      
 The village has an extensive          
 boundary with a very rural aspect     
 consisting of farmland and a great    
 deal fo mixed forestry.               
 The  twin focal points are the village
 church and the pub, the Fox Inn.      
 The village also has a large number   
 of listed buildings of typical        
 Hampshire style. There are            
 comparitively few arranged amenities  
 and many services such as gas and     
 mains drainage are
