		<content>{HOUSING IN WOODHALL SPA               
 Housing of all types exist,large,older
 properties with plenty of ground,once 
 built to accomodate patients for      
 treatment in the Spa's heyday are now 
 being turned into rest homes,giving   
 the Spa a very high geriatric         
 ratio.Modern buildings favour detached
 2 and 3 bedroomed bungalows &amp; houses, 
 but executive homes usually having 4  
 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms.Some exising 
 terrace houses still have no inside   
 toilets.Recently there has been a     
 storm against allowing further        
 development,and the people in Witham  
 Road in particular have voiced their  
 options in an organised manner.Less   
 organised are the prodevelopment      
 people who want to see expansion in   
 order to keep up trade figures and    
 facilities.The village is roughly     
 divided in this.                      </content>
