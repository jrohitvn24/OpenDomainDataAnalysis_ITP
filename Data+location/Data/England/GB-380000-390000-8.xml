    Father McDonald tells us that he   
 had wanted to be a priest since he was
 six when he became an Altar boy at St.
 Joseph's church, Birkenhead. Father   
 and his family lived in Birkenhead for
 most of their childhood. He was       
 educated at St. Joseph's Primary      
 School, Hotten Hill Convent and       
 finally at Urshaw College, Durham.    
 Father was ordained to the priesthood 
 on June the 12th, 1960 at the age of  
 24. Since his ordination to the       
 priesthood he has worked as a curate  
 in the Cathedral, Shrewsbury, the     
 Sacred Heart, Morton and St. Joseph's 
 church, Sale. He was assigned to the  
 Holy Family as a parish priest in     
 1975.
