		<title>04Long Sandall-a dying village</title>
		<content> The present residents of the Manor    
 House,{Long Sandall,}have lived there 
 since{1949,}when it was a quiet,      
 peaceful village. The cottages were   
 well cared for, and barges stopped on 
 the{canal}to use the shop. Over the   
 last 25 years industry has moved      
 closer so that now the council say    
 that the houses are too close to the  
 factories.{In the 1970s}the council   
 proposed to demolish houses, but      
 people did not want to move and signed
 a petition asking the council to pre- 
 serve the village. The petition failed
 and most of the inhabitants moved. A  
 local man is interested in converting 
 the old barns into craft workshops    
 with flats above. If this does not    
 happen, Long Sandall may remain a     
 village that has returned to a        
 population similar to that of{1086.}
