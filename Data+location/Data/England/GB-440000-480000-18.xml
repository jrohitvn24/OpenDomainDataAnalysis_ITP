		<title>18Currying in Sowerby</title>
		<content> Tanned leather has been dressed, or   
 curried, at 'The Tannery ' in Sowerby 
 since 1815. After retanning, the hide 
 is separated from the underlying skin 
 by a continuous blade,called a slicer.
 Then, as leather is bought by weight  
 and sold by area, it is then stretched
 and flattened by the 250 ton pressure 
 of a plating machine, which can also  
 give the leather the pattern of       
 crocodile or pigskin. Sanded and dyed,
 the finished leather is sold to be    
 made into weight-lifter's belts,dog   
 collars and upholstery. Currying      
 requires that the hide be dried and   
 remoistened between each stage,so that
 the whole process takes between 4 and 
 6 weeks.Currying is an ancient process
 which employs both old and new methods
 One ingenious machine,invented in 1915
 is still used in measuring area.
