		<title>02SITE OF BLEASBY</title>
		<content>   As the rushing water from the melted
 ice slowed down sand and gravel were  
 deposited on the trench bottom.Shrewd 
 early man built his dwellings on the  
 higher deposits to avoid being flooded
 when the River was high.Thus{Bleasby  
{settlement},in common with a string of
 riverside villages along this part of 
 the{Trent},was established. This      
 higher area is still occupied by the  
 centre of the village:church, vicarage
 ,Hall,pub and many older houses.      
   During the last 100 years the land  
 between this old village and the{     
{Railway Station},still called Notown ,
 which is not surprising since it was  
 subject to periodic flooding,has been 
 filled up with two small estates and  
 roadside housing.The total{population}
 is now 700. S.W. towards the River is 
{Gibsmere}and 1/4 of a mile the other  
 way,towards{Thurgarton},is{Goverton.  </content>
