 There are 8 classrooms and a hall,    
 which is used for assembly,P.E. and

 premises.                             
    We attend school every day except  
 for Saturday and Sunday.School starts 
 at 0900 and finishes at 1545 for the  
 juniors and 1515 for the infants.We   
 have a lunch break of 75 mins.and a   
 playtime in the morning of 20 mins.and
 one in the afternoon of 15 mins.      
       We begin with registration      
 followed by assembly. Sometime during 
 the day we do some mathematics,writing
 reading and topic work .At the end of 
 the day Mr.Gibson reads a book to     
 us.Then it is home time so we change  
 our shoes,put our chairs on the desks,
 to make cleaning easier for the       
 care-taker,and go home.
