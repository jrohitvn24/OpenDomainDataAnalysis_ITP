 In the football season they played    
 football in the field behind the      
 school. They went up to Mr. White's   
 and killed as many mice as they could.
 They played Fox and Hounds:- one      
 person hid and the others tried to    
 find him. They played Tipcat which was
 hitting a sharp bit of wood on the end
 with a stick. It flew in the air and  
 you tried to hit it. They played with 
 hoops,tops and conkers.

 They played hopscotch and with tops   
 and hoops.
