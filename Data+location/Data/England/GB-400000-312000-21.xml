<title>21Hednesford Hills Raceway</title>
<content>Hednesford is a full quarter mile length oval, with two banked corners, and a tarmac track surface surrounded by an armco safety fence.&lt;br />&lt;br />It is steeped in motor racing history and packed with all the ingredients for a great family day out, The circuit was built in 1952 utilising the site of a former reservoir. With the track built at the base of the reservoir, it has the advantage of being at the bottom of a large "bowl", with grass banks surrounding the circuit providing excellent views for spectators.&lt;br />&lt;br /> Formula's which race there range from non contact National Hot Rods &amp; Ledgends through to the contact formula's of BriSCA F1 &amp; F2 stock cars &amp; Bangers. &lt;br />&lt;br />Meetings are still run on Sundays &amp; Bank Holidays but have now been reduced to only 20 a year due to local noise restrictions&lt;br />&lt;br />Racing here is promoted by Incarace who are now under the ownership of Spedeworth Motorsports.&lt;br />
