		<title>17DRAGONVILLE INDUSTRIAL EST.1</title>
		<content>  The Dragonville Industrial Estate was
 set up in the aftermath of the Second 
 World War.The original companies were 
 quite large scale concerns which      
 employed many local workers.          
  Amongst the first of these concerns  
 were Durham Engineering, Mono         
 containers manufacturers of plastic   
 and paper containers, and Bickers who 
 produced clothing.                    
  Over the the years a much greater    
 number of smaller units have developed
 but three large concerns have also    
 appeared on the scene within the last 
 fifteen years or so.Of these the best 
 known is Mackays Carpets who have a   
 world wide reputation for their Durham
 carpets and have developed their site 
 at Dragonville at the expense of their
 former head-quarters within the city.
