		<content> Every morning when I wake up I make my
 bed get washed and feed the guinea    
 pigs. After I have fed the guinea     
 pigs, mummy sometimes goes shopping.  
 I go with her.  When we get home I    
 help mummy in the house. Then after   
 lunch we take the dogs for a long     
 walk.  We have two alsations. If daddy
 is in the garden my sister and I go   
 and give him a hand. Sometimes we get 
 the Barbie dolls and Sindy dolls out  
 to play together.  We get the garden  
 set out for the dolls and we play     
 camping games.  When we have finished 
 playing the games we take the dogs for
 another walk and get more guinea food 
 and when we come back we help mummy   
 with the tea.  We have a salad so I   
 wash the lettuce, cut up the tomatoes,
 peel and the slice the cucumber and   
 shell the boiled eggs. For pudding we 
 have peaches, ice-cream and jelly.    </content>
