		<title>02Hedgerows in the Blackdowns.</title>
		<content> A hundred metres of hedgerow bordering
 a road on a 16% slope were to contain 
 the following eleven species: oak,ash,
 blackthorn, hawthorn, sycamore,       
 field-maple, hazel, holly, willow,    
 elm  and elder.  Other woody species  
 in nearby hedges are wild cherry and  
 dogwood. Ivy,bramble and rose scramble
 among the shrubs. This road and others
 like it almost certainly existed when 
 the first Domesday book was compiled. 
 In contrast some hedgerows on the     
 plateau are almost pure beech,and     
 these date from early 19th century    
 enclosures.The sides and tops of these
 hedgebanks form a habitat for many    
 wild flowers.Among the most           
 conspicuous are bluebells in May,     
 foxgloves in June and rosebay willow  
 herb in July. Ferns are abundant on   
 the shadier hedgebanks, particularly  
 polypody,soft shield and male ferns.  </content>
