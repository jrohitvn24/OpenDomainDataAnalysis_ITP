The Red Hand                           
Some men were invading an island and   
theCaptain of the troops said that the 
first one to touch the shore could have
the island so one man cut off his hand 
and threw it onto the beach and he got 
the island.                            
                                       
  Lamport Hall is very big.It has about
25 rooms I think.The room I liked best 
was called the Oak room because the    
walls were panelled with oak carved    
into squares.They used wood because it 
made the room warm.It had some muskets 
in it.They were very heavy guns that   
soldiers fought with in old battles    
like the Battle of Naseby.There were   
pewter plates and big jugs made of     
leather.
