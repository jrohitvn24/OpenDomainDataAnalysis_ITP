		<title>08History of Wallop</title>
		<content>  If any region deserves to be called  
 the cradle of England, this must      
 surely be it.                         
 From the famous Iron Age hill         
 settlement of Danebury to the site of 
 the mysterious Dark Age battle of     
 Guoloppum in AD436 on the Wallop      
 Brook, it is part of the very fabric  
 of Early English History.             
 In 1918 a hoard of Bronze Age axes,   
 almost certainly a travelling smith's 
 stock, were discovered to the north   
 east of Nether Wallop.                
 Between the two World Wars, a         
 Neolithic Longbarrow about 500m NE of 
 our school was destroyed to make way  
 for the modern airfield and also      
 introducing the modern name of Middle 
 Wallop.In the centre of the region the
 name Bustards Corner is the only      
 reminder of the beautiful birds,now   
 extinct,which once flew over Hampshire</content>
