		<title>08FARMING IN PRESTON.</title>
		<content> The farm in Preston has belonged to   
 Mr. Huck's family for 65 years, and he
 has owned it for 25 years. It is      
 called the Village Farm. There are    
 three people working on the farm, Mr. 
 Huck and two other men. They plant    
 their seeds for their new crops in    
 the Autumn. They grow wheat for bread,
 oil seed rape for the animal's feed in
 the winter, and they also grow oats.  
 For machinery they have 1 Combine     
 Harvester, 1 big Sprayer, and one     
 large tractor and three small ones.   
 There are no animals on the farm      
 except for two dogs and two cats      
 which are the family pets.
