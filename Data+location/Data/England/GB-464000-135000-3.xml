         The Medstead Information      
 centre has the only purpose built     
 information centre out of all the     
 schools in Hampshire. The information 
 centre is unique for its computers and
 computer technology. It is one of the 
 nine schools in Europe which has been 
 chosen for the IBM project. (The IBM  
 project is an experiment to see how   
 children cope with the IBM programs). 
                                       
         It has five IBM computers     
 and three BBC computers. It has       
 carpets, unlike most other schools. It
 is probably the first primary school  
 with a modem which is linked up to the
  Times network which is at present    
 supposed to be only available to      
 secondary schools and colleges. It is 
 a very complex centre and needs a lot 
 of organisation.           cont/page 4</content>
