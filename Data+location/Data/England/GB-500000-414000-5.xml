		<title>05Interviewing a Farm Worker</title>
		<content>   {Mr. Cundy}whom I interviewed worked
 on three farms.The first one was owned
 by Mr. Cheeseman.He worked there for  
 two years.                            
  They used{two horses}and one{man}to  
 each plough.They had{14 milk cows}on  
 this farm.                            
 He worked there for{Sixty years.}In   
 the Winter they had fewer workers than
 in the Summer.None of the workers     
 worked shifts but he worked from{Six  
{AM}to{Six PM}six days a week          
 altogether{seventy-two hours}a week.  
   At first they herded the sheep in   
 and out of the farm themselves. Later 
 on they used{one sheep dog. Twelve    
{pigs}were kept.Every farm worker had  
 fresh jobs each day.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
