		<title>01Our Domesday Project Area.</title>
		<content>   Our Domesday Project block is a     
 rural area. The villages in the area  
 are Waltham,part of Barnoldby le Beck,
 New Waltham,Brigsley and Scartho.There
 are 2 streams in the block,Waithe Beck
 and Buck Beck which prevents the land 
 around Waltham from flooding by taking
 the water to the River Humber. Waltham
 has an unusual feature of a windmill. 
   The families of some of the people  
 have lived and worked in this area for
 a number of generations,others have   
 moved here to the new estates being   
 built, because they like the peace    
 and quiet of the countryside and are  
 able to reach their place of work in  
 Grimsby,Immingham, Cleethorpes and the
 Humber Bank by car.                   
   The villagers use the shops and     
 other amenities found in the area for 
 their everyday needs and take part in 
 village activities and clubs.         </content>
