		<title>18A Mum's day</title>
		<content> My Mum wakes up at about 7.00 am.     
 She dresses,washes and goes downstairs
 to make breakfast for my brother and  
 I. After breakfast she washes up and  
 makes my younger brother get ready for
 school.  Then she hoovers and polishes
 downstairs.  At about 8.45am she sends
 my brother off to school and then she 
 watches the end of Breakfast TV.  When
 this has finished she will go upstairs
 &amp; make our beds.  About 9.45 she gets 
 ready for work; she works at the local
 pub, The 'Rose And Crown'.            
  Mum starts work at 10.30.  She cleans
 the bar &amp; makes sure that everything  
 is ready for opening time-from 11.00  
 until 2.30.  She serves drinks and    
 food to customers.  She returns home  
 around 3.15., has a cup of tea and    
 starts to prepare tea for the family. 
 When tea is over and she has done the 
 washing-up,she watches TV until 10.30.</content>
