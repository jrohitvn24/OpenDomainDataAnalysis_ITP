		<title>06SOUTHWELL SINCE 1945</title>
		<content> We asked our school secretary Mrs.    
 Margaret Swan who has lived in        
 Southwell all her life what has been  
 the biggest change in Southwell since 
 1945.She said she thought it was the  
 increase in the population. No new    
 pubs have opened since 1945 but three 
 pubs have closed down. The{Grapes,}The
{Shoulder of Mutton}and The{Portland.} 
 The schools that were in Southwell    
 were the Minster Grammer,The National 
 Church of England,The Methodist,The   
 Rodney (PRIVATE) and Holy Trinity. The
 Minster Grammer,The Rodney (PRIVATE)  
 and Holy Trinity are still in         
 Southwell and in 1966 a new school    
 called{LOWES WONG Infant and Junior   
{School}opened. No new roads have      
 opened only the roads on the modern   
 housing estates.
