		<content> The area being looked at lies on the  
 outskirts of{Stockton}in the County   
 of Cleveland in the North East of     
 England. The housing consists of a    
{mixture}comprising the council estate 
 of Roseworth, a small village of      
 Thorpe Thewles  with private housing  
 and rural cottages, farm dwellings and
 large private houses. The latter      
 border both sides of the main road    
 called Junction Road which crosses    
 part of the block and is a main artery
 to the neighbouring towns of          
 Billingham and  Norton.               
 The{landscape}is mainly flat,there    
 being few steep gradients and much of 
 the{"BLOCK"}is in fact rural land used
 for agricultural purposes. At the     
 moment this rural land seems in little
 danger of being developed, either for 
 industrial,business or housing        
 purposes.                             </content>
