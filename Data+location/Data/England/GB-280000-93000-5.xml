		<content> In the 1920's wood work, metal work   
 and domestic science were introduced, 
 and a garden (orchard) was cultivated.
 Additional classes were offered in bee
 keeping, cheese making, pruning,      
 thatching and milk production.        
 The second world war brought large    
 numbers of evacuees into the village, 
 together with their teachers. At the  
 end of the war there were 63 children 
 and 2 teachers. In 1947 the school    
 became a primary school (5-11 yrs).   
 A kitchen was built in 1951, and a    
 swimming pool in 1969. In the 1970's  
 the school house was converted into   
 classrooms, medical room and staff    
 room. It is now used as a music and   
 television room. In 1983 work began on
 2 new infant rooms, head's office,    
 library and hall facilities. In 1985  
 there are just over 100 children in   
 school.                               </content>
