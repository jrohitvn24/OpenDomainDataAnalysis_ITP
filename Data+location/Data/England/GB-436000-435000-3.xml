		<content>{Working on the Domesday Project}      
 We visited the Buffers at Scholes. It 
 has changed from being a railway      
 station with trains going to York,    
 Scarborough, Malton, Hull and         
 Doncaster, to being a pub and         
 restaurant. Most of the land around   
 was grass and farm land with just a   
 few houses and pubs. Another site of  
 interest we saw was the Barwick in    
 Elmet Maypole. It was about two times 
 as high as our school maypole and it  
 has got some bells which seem to be   
 made out of flower petals. We also did
 four wall charts. One of what we have 
 in our streets, where our parents shop
 and how far it is to places, and three
 amenities charts.We have one map of   
 the area we have to cover in this     
 survey.
