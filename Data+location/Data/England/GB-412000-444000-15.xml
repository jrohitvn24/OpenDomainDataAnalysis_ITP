		<title>15ECOLOGY- CHANGING LAND COVER</title>
		<content> Evidence for this work was given by{  
{Mrs. Duncan}who is the secretary of   
 the{Wharfedale Naturalists.}          
{Mrs. Duncan}says that on the top of   
 the moorland the heather is returning,
 although it had disappeared when the{ 
{1959-1960}survey was done by the      
 Wharfedale Naturalists. This was      
 because the sheep were grazing        
 uncontrolably and they eat the        
{heather.}Grazing is now being         
 restricted so the{heather}is          
 returning. Now there are many rocks   
 covered in plants such as{crowberry   
{and bilberry.}In{1903}was much        
 heather and little grazing of sheep.  
 Now there are many wet areas on the   
 moor where{horsetail cotton grass}and 
 many{headed cotton grasses}grow.      
 Grazing makes a large difference to   
 the vegitation on the moor as sheep   
 only eat certain types of vegitation. </content>
