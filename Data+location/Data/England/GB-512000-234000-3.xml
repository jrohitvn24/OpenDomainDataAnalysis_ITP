		<content> Generations of Ansells, Hydes, Hares, 
 Jenkins, Ingreys, Wilsons, Ingrams,   
 Coles, Coopers and Harrises have      
 attended the village schools, but     
 Shillington is not a parochial        
 village. Its just that once having    
 lived here, people often "come home to
 roost."                               
 This is not a "pretty postcard" sort  
 of village. It has developed a lot    
 over the years, red brick houses,     
 white thatched cottages and small     
 estates all make up the patchwork of  
 the community. People have moved in   
 from far and wide, everyone finds it  
 easy to slot into village life.       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
