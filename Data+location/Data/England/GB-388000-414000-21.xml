OMG I can't believe I've found my contribution to the Domesday Project.&lt;br />&lt;br />I remember spending ages writing my story and drawing a picture at the top page showing me playing "Murder Ball" - A good piece of creative writing, and much better than my wife's contribution which can be found under Walderslade in Kent, which consists of a survey taken at the local shops. She does however, have a picture showing her taking the survey; she's the one on the far right in the red dress!   &lt;br />
