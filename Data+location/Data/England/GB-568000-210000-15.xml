		<title>15BROOMFIELD HOSPITAL II</title>
		<content>{ Broomfield Hospital}is one of the few
 hospitals that has a{C.A.T.Scanner.}  
 This is a piece of equipment that can 
 tell doctors if you have a{tumour}or  
 or other growth.For example if you    
 kept on getting headaches the doctors 
 would take you to the scanning machine
 which would scan you and find any     
{tumours}.                             
  In the{x-ray department}they have    
 three different coloured areas,one for
 your body,one for arms and legs and   
 one for your skull. This is to speed  
 up dealing with suspected broken      
 bones.                                
  This department is next door to the  
 reception and casualty areas so badly 
 injured people can receive rapid      
 emergency treatment.
