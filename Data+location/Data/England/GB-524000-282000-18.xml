		<title>18UPWOOD MANOR (PART 3)</title>
		<content> Mr.and Mrs.Rowley used to live in     
 London. They moved to Upwood a few    
 years ago to live in the country.     
 Before they moved there, 56 High St.  
 was an old coach house. There were    
 ruts left from where the coach went   
 in. When they moved there there was a 
 petrol pump by the wall. They were    
 told by experts to move it because it 
 could have been dangerous. Also there 
 was a well in the back garden which   
 they dug out a little while ago. One  
 of their sheds they now use for junk. 
 When they came it was a stable. There 
 are also traces of bricks under the   
 garden.
