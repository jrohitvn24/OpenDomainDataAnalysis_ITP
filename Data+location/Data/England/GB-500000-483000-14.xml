		<content>  Irton Produce,which was opened in    
 1975,is a typical market garden.It is 
 situated about 7 kilometres outside   
 Scarborough,just to the north of the  
 village of Irton,and so most of its   
 produce is sold locally,to shops and  
 markets.The market garden covers 10   
 hectares and is intensively cultivated
 growing a wide range of crops,either  
 in the open or under glass.These      
 include strawberries,cabbages,peas,   
 shrubs,potatoes and pot plants.The    
 garden is privately owned:it employs  
 2 full time workers and many part time
 workers (particularly in harvest time)
 when the produce is hand picked.There 
 is a limited use of machinery,such as 
 2 tractors,2 ploughs and 4 trailers.  
 They also sell fertilizers,plant foods
 pesticides and also hot and cold      
 drinks.The owner lives in his own     
 cottage on the premises.              </content>
