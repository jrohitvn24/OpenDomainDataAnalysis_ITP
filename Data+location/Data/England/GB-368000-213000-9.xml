		<content> At our school on a Thursday is        
 swimming. Before we go we do a bit of 
 work. We are allowed to take something
 to eat on the way back, like a packet 
 of crisps. We have to go out of the   
 area by bus to get to the swimming    
 pool. We have a lesson with Mrs       
 Bunston. It costs 35p to go. We do    
 breast stroke, front crawl, back      
 stroke, butterfly, side stroke.       
 There is a diving pool and an         
 ordinary one. You can do a sitting    
 down dive but if you go wrong with a  
 dive you call it a belly flop. Belly  
 flops hurt your tummy. For swimming if
 you cannot swim very well you can wear
 arm bands and a rubber ring.          
                                       
 NETBALL is a game usually played by   
 girls but at our school the boys help 
 us play. The Centre throws out the    
 ball to Wing Attack or Wing Defence   </content>
