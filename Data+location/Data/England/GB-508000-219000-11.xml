		<title>11JOHN'S CAR-WASH SERVICE</title>
		<content> Some time during 1971,John,who lives  
 in Cambridge Street,cleaned a friend's
 car inside and out for just 50 pence. 
 In no time at all,word got around,and 
 suddenly John was in business.His own 
 preferred mode of transport is a road-
 ster bicycle equipped front and rear  
 with wire baskets which carry special-
 ist polishes,shampoos and other clean-
 ing gear.During a typical working day 
 he may cycle to Dunstable,Markyate,and
 other outlying areas to serve his     
 clients who include hairdressers,taxi 
 firms,and company directors.Business  
 falls off in the winter but is good in
 summer. Until British Rail changed the
 design of their luggage vans,he would 
 often take his bike on the train to   
 London's West End for the day to      
 attend to the cleaning needs of his   
 more affluent patrons.Enterprise!{N.W.
