		<content> This area is mainly rural with        
 scattered farms and is criss crossed  
 by dykes and minor roads. The land is 
 flat and used mainly for cereal       
 farming and cattle grazing. On the    
 Eastern side is a sewage farm which   
 serves the local area. Traffic in the 
 area increases during the summer      
 period and is often delayed by farm   
 vehicles, eg., tractors and combine   
 harvesters serving the farms. R A F   
 aircraft are frequently flying over   
 the area to practice firing and       
 bombing at Wainfleet Bombing Range a  
 little further down the coast,        
 disturbing the area's peace and       
 tranquility.
