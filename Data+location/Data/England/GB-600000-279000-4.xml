		<content>   This is a small, quiet &amp; scattered  
{FARMING}village (200-250), away from  
 through traffic. New building is res- 
 tricted by planning guidelines and has
 been limited to six in six years. The 
 village has a church and hall, one    
 public telephone and post box but     
 little else as the shop/P.O. has      
 recently closed.                      
  {SOIL}varies from silt to blue clay  
 with mainly arable farming, and some  
 grazing. There is a battery chicken   
 farm, duck and pig farming and heifers
 reared for a Hinderclay dairy herd. A 
 goat herd provides cheese and yoghurt.
{HORSES}are stabled, and prepared for  
 shows. A 1985 success was the award   
 of 'The Horse Of The Year'.           
   Prince Frederick Duleep Singh, 2nd  
 son of the Maharaja of Lahore lived at
 the{HALL}for many years and is buried 
 in the churchyard.                    </content>
