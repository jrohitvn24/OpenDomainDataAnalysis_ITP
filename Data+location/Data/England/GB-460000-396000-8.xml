		<title>08CHURCHES IN ROSSINGTON</title>
		<content>     There are many places of worship  
 in Rossington.  The oldest church is  
 St Michael's, built in early Norman   
 times.  It is an Anglican church, as  
 is St Luke's which was built in 1916  
 in New Rossington to serve the growing
 community around the coalmine.        
    The other churches in the village  
 are the Roman Catholic Christ the     
 King, the Methodist, the Salvation    
 Army and the New Life Christian       
 Fellowship.                           
     Most of the churches have         
 organisations attached to them such as
 Girl Guide, Brownie, Scout, Cub and   
 women's groups.                       
     The churches hold United Services 
 at intervals throughout the year.     
     For the 1985 visit of the American
 evangelist, Dr Billy Graham, the      
 churches organised coaches to         
 Sheffield for Mission England.        </content>
