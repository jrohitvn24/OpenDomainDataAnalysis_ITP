		<content>  Birchley Hall,built 1594,is a three  
 storied ,timbered manor house.The Hall
 structure has not been altered,but for
 minor details, since 1600. It has a   
 chapel which was once Catholic and is 
 now a non_denominational place of     
 worship.                              
  The home of several wealthy families 
 until 1975 it is now a Sue Ryder      
 Foundation Home for the elderly,sick  
 and disabled. The running costs are   
 met from a Charitable Trust which is  
 organised by Sue Ryder. The Trust     
 finances many similar homes througout 
 the world.                            
  The residents are cared for by nurses
 and other staff, their infirmity stops
 them from leaving the Hall and gardens
 they spend most of their time reading 
 or watching T.V. One of the residents,
 Mrs. Redmond, 92 years old, spent her 
 childhood at the Hall.                </content>
