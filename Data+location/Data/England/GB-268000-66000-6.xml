 Most working people in the area are   
 concerned in some way with            
{agriculture,}either as farmers,       
 smallholders or farm labourers. We    
 also found a man who teaches people   
 how to drive a pony and trap, and     
 heard of one who produces 1200 gallons
 of cider a year for sale to local     
 pubs. Many others work outside the    
 area, mostly in Buckfastleigh,        
 although we did hear of a secretary   
 who works as far away as Plymouth.    
                                       
                                       
 There is also a high proportion of    
 retired people living in the area.
