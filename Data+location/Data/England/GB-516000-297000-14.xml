		<content>{ The Evening Telegraph,}Peterborough's
 daily newspaper, is 24 years old in   
 1985 and costs 16 pence per night, for
 an average 32 page issue. It is       
 enjoying its best spell where sales   
 are concerned and for the third       
 successive time (sixth-monthly audited
 figures) has earned the title,        
 'Britain's fastest growing evening    
 newspaper' (32,000 nightly). The      
 content is a mixture of advertising   
 and news, broken down to international
 national and local items, with sports 
 pages at the back and a number of     
 regular features. It is produced by a 
 total staff of around 180 people on a 
 site at Woodston, 45 of them being    
 journalists. Their stories are rekeyed
 by printers using visual display units
 and the 'type' is produced by a       
 computer for pasting up on the page   
 prior to printing.                    </content>
