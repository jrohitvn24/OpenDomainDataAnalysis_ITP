{First School}was built in 1964 for 25 
 pupils.The former school building is  
 now the village hall.There are 12     
 pupils from 4_9 years. It is staffed  
 by a headteacher,a part_time infant   
 teacher,a part_time secretary,a       
 cleaner and a cook/nanny.             
  It has two classrooms,which can be   
 converted into one large room by means
 of a sliding screen.The school has a  
 large,grassed playing field and its   
 own computer.                         
  At present,{Northumberland County    
{Council}is reviewing the school's     
 future because of the current small   
 roll.                                 
  The children are brought to school   
 from the outlying farms by contract   
 hire cars.
