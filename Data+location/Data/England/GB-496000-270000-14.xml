		<title>14STANWICK FETE</title>
		<content> Stanwick fete is held on the first    
 Saturday of June every year.It is     
 organized by the chairman of the fete 
 committee.600 to 700 people generally 
 attend the fete.There are around 20   
 stalls.The money which was raised this
 year,(Â£900) goes mainly to the        
 Stanwick church restoration fund.Some 
 of the main attractions are the       
 gymkhana and the dog show.Some of the 
 main problems are the weather and the 
 lack of help.The fete was first held  
 in 1971 and it was Mr. Allybones      
 idea.Very few people help with the    
 clearing up.Mr. Marks supplies the    
 jumps and bales for the gymkhana.The  
 fete started when Mr.Allybones and the
 church talked about ways to raise     
 money for the old school rooms which  
 were falling down.
