		<title>18IRON ACTON FOLK CLUB</title>
		<content> I arrived at 8.15p.m.,and the music   
 was about to start.The folk-club is   
 held each Friday in the back room of  
 the Lamb Inn,and costs Â£1.00 for the  
 evening's entertainment.For the first 
 hour,the compere called various people
 up to perform.There were so many that 
 there was only time for one item each.
 Some sang unaccompanied songs; some   
 sang and played guitar;there was a    
 banjo player too.The music included   
 traditional English ballads,American  
 blues,and modern songs in the folk    
 idiom.The performers ranged in age    
 from 7(Fliss,the landlord's daughter) 
 to about 55.The compere then announced
 the guest for the evening.He sang     
 mainly comic songs,with amusing banter
 between songs.There was an interval,  
 when people replenished their glasses 
 at the bar,and the pattern was the    
 same in the second half.              </content>
