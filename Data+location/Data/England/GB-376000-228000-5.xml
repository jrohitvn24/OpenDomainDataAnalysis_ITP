		<content>  Certain events occur every year. The 
 Church has a fete on the field next to
 it; the school has a fete and a sports
 day; there is also a road race on     
 August Bank Holiday which starts at   
 the Prince of Wales pub. Money is     
 raised for the Newent disabled club.  
 The church often organises cheese and 
 wine evenings and supper at people's  
 homes. To help raise funds, dances are
 held every week in the village hall.  
  The last important event was the     
 celebration of the Silver Jubilee of  
 the Queen in 1977. A party was held on
 the playing field for the people of   
 Corse and Staunton. Commemerative mugs
 were given to all the children.       
  The school and playgroup had a       
 tea-party for the wedding of Prince   
 Charles and Lady Diana.
