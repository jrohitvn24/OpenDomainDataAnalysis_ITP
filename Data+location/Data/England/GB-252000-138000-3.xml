		<content>    There are only two roads in this   
 area which have a single lane for each
 direction of traffic.They are busy    
 between 8.15am_9am and 4.30_6pm,when  
 people travel through the area on     
 their way to work.                    
    45 vehicles passed through Milltown
 between 8.40 and 8.55am on 4.7.85. on 
 their way towards Barnstaple.         
    20 vehicles went in the other      
 direction.                            
    All the other roads are very narrow
 and winding with passing places and   
 poor visibility.There are no general  
 bus services or other public transport
 other than the school buses so cars   
 are essential and nearly every family 
 has at least one if not two.          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
