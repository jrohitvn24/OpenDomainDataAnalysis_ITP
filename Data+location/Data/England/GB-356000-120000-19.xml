		<title>19TOMATO GROWING.</title>
		<content> The Jones family of Chilton Cantelo   
 own a tomato farm.This farm was formed
 after World War 2.There are 7 acres   
 of land mainly covered by greenhouses.
 They have a continuous succession of  
 ripe tomatoes by using the method of  
 planting in March and October. Over   
 the whole area a total of 55,000      
 plants are grown but not all of these 
 develop into healthy plants. Some are 
 hit by white fly which feeds off of   
 the plant and will eventually kill it 
 if left untreated. The only way to get
 rid of this pest without harming the  
 plant is to spray them with Enserica. 
 Most plants are grown in rock wool and
 a few in water. Each plant is fed with
 fertilizer to ensure a good crop.     
 Some plants can grow up to 30 feet    
 long. The company produces 280,000    
 pounds of tomatoes a year which are   
 sold to two local firms.              </content>
