		<content>When indoors, especially in the winter 
months, the family spends a great part 
of its time watching television.       
Reading is very popular with Mother and
the children. Father is usually engaged
in work around the house, or using the 
computer with the children. The        
children spend a lot of time on the    
computer. Mother usually knits or sews.
In the summer, Father likes sporting   
activities like jogging, bowls and     
snooker. He spends time in his garden. 
Mother likes outdoor activities, but   
mainly walking and gardening. The local
keep fit class is also very popular.   
The children spend most of their time  
out doors riding their bicycles or     
playing with their friends.  The "BMX" 
type of bike is very popular and boys  
very often construct makeshift courses 
on waste land.
