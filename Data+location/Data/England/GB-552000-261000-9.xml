		<title>09THE CHURCH,SWAFFHAM BULBECK</title>
		<content> The church is a 13th century church.It
 is mainly made of clunch,flint and    
 brick.It has a strong oak door with   
 iron on it.The tower has been patched 
 up with new brick.The arch way at the 
 back of the church has got an         
 interesting patern scratched in the   
 clunch.The grave stones are terrebly  
 old.Dead people are now burried in the
 cemetry.The church is called          
 St.Marys.The church is 750 years      
 old.Bits for the church were added in 
 the 15th century.The pews are also    
 15th century.The ceiling is made of   
 wood.Inbetween some of the pews the   
 floor is rotton and is falling to     
 bits.In the 17th century stupid people
 went round knoking the carvings off   
 the end of the pews because they didnt
 believe in them.So when you go into   
 the church you only see half of the   
 carvings left.                        </content>
