		<title>02TRANSPORT - CROSSROADS</title>
		<content> Our area is{rural}so there are no A   
 roads. We made surveys for the{three  
{main crossroads}in our block. Each    
 week we went out at{1:30}and returned 
 at{2:00pm.}After our visits we made a 
 graph. The{Highlanes}and{Padstow      
 crossroads were busier than{St. Merryn
 crossroads.We think its because       
 Highlanes and Padstow are main roads  
 and eventually join the{A:30          
 road.It was also{lunchtime}and not    
 many vehicles were on the road;lorries
 usually{unload}in the{morning.}There  
 were many cars along the main roads at
 Highlanes and Padstow. A{dustcart}and 
{bus}were seen at Padstow and Highlanes
 on two of the Tuesdays which means    
 that a bus travels from{Padstow to    
{Wadebridge}at that time.We completed  
 these surveys in{April}and{May}before 
 the onslaught of{summer traffic.
