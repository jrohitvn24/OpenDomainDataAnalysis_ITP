		<content> AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY ARE THE MAIN 
 LAND USES IN THIS AREA, ALTHOUGH ONLY 
 ABOUT FIFTY PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYED IN    
 THESE INDUSTRIES. THERE ARE{THREE     
{DAIRY HERDS}IN LACEY GREEN TOTALLING  
 ABOUT{300 COWS.}THE MILK IS COLLECTED 
 DAILY BY BULK TANKER AND IS TAKEN TO A
 DAIRY IN LONDON. THE REST OF FARMING  
 IS GIVEN OVER TO ARABLE CROPS,{WHEAT, 
{BARLEY AND OATS WITH OIL-SEED RAPE}AS 
 A BREAK CROP. THERE IS NO LARGE SCALE 
 GROWING OF VEGETABLES AS THE SOIL IS  
 TOO STONY. AT{SAUNDERTON}THERE IS A   
{STUD}WHERE HAFLINGER AND RACE HORSES  
 ARE BRED. THERE ARE TWO PLANT         
 NURSERIES, ONE NEAR POUND FARM WHICH  
 GROWS SEEDLINGS FOR THE TRADE AND THE 
 OTHER AT DEAN FARM WHICH IS ALSO A    
 GARDEN CENTRE MUCH PATRONISED BY LOCAL
 ENTHUSIASTS. LARGE SCALE FORESTRY IS  
 NOT PRACTISED IN THIS AREA NOWADAYS.
