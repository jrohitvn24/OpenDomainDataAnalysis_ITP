		<title>15 Stud Farm</title>
		<content>Stud Farm includes about 120 acres of  
land, including 8 acres of woodland.   
The crops grown are wheat, barley,     
oats, potatoes and a large amount of   
grass for hay. Hay and straw is sold or
kept for peas and sugar beet. We have  
ducks,hens, young pheasants and horses.
We keep the horses for business and    
pleasure. Some are taken to shows in   
summer. The Whitemoor Mine has affected
us only during blasting to find the    
depth of coal. Some of our neighbours, 
living closer to the mine, have been   
affected more than us. During the      
recent miners' stike, some miners came 
down quite early in the morning asking 
if they could get through to the mine  
by crossing our land.
