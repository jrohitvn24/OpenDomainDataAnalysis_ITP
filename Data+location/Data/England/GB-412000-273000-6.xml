		<title>06SUMMER FETE 1985</title>
		<content> This year our Summer Fete had a       
 'Country Fayre' theme -this was a time
 when most people had to make their own
 amusements.The Fayre was opened by the
 'Fete Queen' and her attendants on a  
 beautiful sunny afternoon.There were  
 demonstrations of lace making,corn    
 dollies and pottery.There were also   
 donkey rides for the children and     
 strawberry teas for the adults.The    
 children of the school gave an        
 exhibition of country dancing and     
 singing.There was also an exhibition  
 of dancing by the Morris Men.         
 This fete has been going on for many  
 years and people from all around the  
 district came and joined in the fun.  
 The proceeds of the fete,which this   
 year raised about Â£1,000,will be      
 divided between the church and the    
 school.
