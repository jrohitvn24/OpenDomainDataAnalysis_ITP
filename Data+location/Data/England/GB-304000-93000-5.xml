 Rockbeare quarry is on Rockbeare Hill.
 Some of us went to see it.First I will
 tell you what Mr.West told us.We saw a
 photograph of the quarry.It was a lot 
 bigger than the school.It was like    
 looking at King Kong compared to an   
 ant.112 people worked in the quarry   
 in 1985.They produce 2000 tons of     
 bricks,gravel,tar,stones &amp; cement a   
 day.The quarry is robbed 3to4 times a 
 year.They have quite a few acidents   
 every year.The worst was when a man   
 thought a conveyor belt was frozen but
 it was not.He reached up to  free it  
 and his hand went in to a roller and  
 took the tops of his fingers off.     
 In the old days before they had       
 machines they used to do something    
 called napping.This was when you got  
 a stone hit it with a hammer to split
