		<title>18Children in Melchbourne</title>
		<content> Of the few children in Melchbourne    
 only nine are under twelve years of   
 age. Activities tend to be            
 self-invented with bycycle riding     
 along the concrete tracks in the woods
 being a favourite.                    
 The schools are all a car or coach    
 ride away, depending upon the school  
 chosen by the parents. To go swimming,
 to Brownies, Cubs or horse riding     
 means a car ride of at least 3 miles -
 nothing is on the doorstep.           
 However, an important event in the    
 weekly calendar for the children,     
 causes the normal routine to be       
 forgotten. Children scatter in all    
 directions looking for their pennies  
 at the sound of the 'sweetie' van     
 arriving. This is a service run by an 
 elderly couple, visiting the village  
 selling not only groceries but        
 penny-style sweets for children.      </content>
