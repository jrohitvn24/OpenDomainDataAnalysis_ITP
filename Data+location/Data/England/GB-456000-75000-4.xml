 Situated in 14 acres of ground on a   
 cliff overlooking the sea at Bonchurch
 Westfield Holiday Centre has been     
 owned by the Wadsworth family for 27  
 years. The main house which is now    
 divided into flats was built for Queen
 Adelaide. The Centre consists of 64   
 chalets and 30 flats and caters for   
 approx. 420 people each week, just    
 under half are children. Westfield is 
 open at Easter and from May to        
 September. Most visitors come from the
 South but during the first two weeks  
 in July many come from Leicester. The 
 centre is completely self-contained   
 providing a shop, launderette, indoor 
 swiming pool, games room, a take-away 
 and live entertainment. There are     
 televisions in every apartment. The   
 apartments are cleaned daily and about
 40 people are employed at the centre. </content>
