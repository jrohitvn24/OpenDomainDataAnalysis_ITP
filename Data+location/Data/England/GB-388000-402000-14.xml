		<title>14The Crown Inn</title>
		<content>   The Wilson's Pub on Walsh Street is 
 called the 'Crown'. It was built about
 100 years ago. The owner, Danny       
 Ferguson, also owns the 'Spotted Cow' 
 on Middleton Road and Greenacres Inn. 
 The 'Crown' has an antiquated licence 
 which was introduced in 1915 for the  
 War Effort and has never been repealed
 since. The customers are locals who go
 for a drink and sometimes to play     
 cards or dominoes. Occasionally one   
 gets drunk at dinnertime or in the    
 evening. In this pub they sell        
 Wilson's old fashioned, traditional   
 beers. All lagers are 'keg', which    
 means they are filtered and chilled.  
 They also sell spirits and fruit      
 juices. Beneath the pub is a cellar   
 where the barrels are stored. The     
 landlord lives in an attic over the   
 pub which was modernised for him in   
 1980.                                 </content>
