		<title>10THE CATTERY SANDON</title>
		<content>  There are two buildings for the cats 
 to stay in and we saw fifteen cats    
 there. Each cat has it's own          
 compartment with a litter tray on the 
 floor. There is a plank of wood for   
 the cat to climb, to reach a higher   
 shelf. There the cat can eat or just  
 sit and sleep. The cats are cleaned   
 and fed at 7.30 a.m. and fed and      
 cleaned again at 4.30 p.m. During the 
 winter the cats often stay for a few  
 weeks, but in summer, it is usually   
 only for a week or two. To own a      
 cattery you need planning permission  
 from the council. Every year a vet    
 comes round to check the animals, so  
 that the owner can apply for a        
 licence. As well as the cattery there 
 is a smallholding. The owners have    
 four dogs, five cats, two horses, two 
 cockerels, five goslings, some geese, 
 chickens, ducks and goats.            </content>
