		<content>    Our 3x4km.block is in the county   
 of Gloucestershire,in a valley of the 
 Cotswold hills.It is approx 23km S.E. 
 of Cheltenham, which is the nearest   
 large town.It is just north of the A40
 Cheltenham to Oxford road,between     
 Northleach and Burford. The area      
 contains the village of Sherborne and 
 most of the village of Windrush.These 
 villages are situated in the valley of
 the Sherborne brook and the River     
 Windrush.Most of Sherborne is fields  
 and pasture,with trees dotted         
 around.Some of the fields are used for
 growing cereal crops,usually wheat and
 barley.There is the Sherborne Park    
 which is a big country estate.It      
 originally belonged to Sherborne House
 but it now belongs to the National    
 Trust.Part of another large Estate,   
 Barrington Park comes into the block.
