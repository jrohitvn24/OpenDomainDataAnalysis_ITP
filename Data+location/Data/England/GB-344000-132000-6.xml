		<content> Mr.Adams (a lay reader) lives in the{ 
{vicarage }and has lived there for 8   
 years .He has lived in Compton for 19 
 years. He lives in one of the few     
 victorian houses in the village.Since 
 he's lived there he has made a number 
 of changes to his house: he has put in
 central heating,he has re-done his    
 roof and converted a room back into a 
 bathroom. Mr. Adams moved to this area
 to take up a teaching appointment at  
 Millfield School.During the last      
 number of years the{village}has grown 
 in size and the population increased. 
 Many of the people who live there are 
 old village families.Enough jobs can  
 be found in a reasonable driving area 
 to keep the people in the village.    
 Today, the{congregation}is fairly     
 small ( approx.25), however many      
 people attend the main festivals such 
 as Christmas and the Harvest.         </content>
