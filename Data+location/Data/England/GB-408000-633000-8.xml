		<content> Middleton Hall is a Grade 2 listed    
 building,which was built around 1871  
 for John T.Leather.It is built of     
 whinstone.                            
 The Hall is a very large house of very
 high proportions in 2 and 3 storeys   
 with a basement,gables and mullioned  
 and transomed windows with 4 centre   
 lights.There is a gabled wing to the  
 left with a large bay window.In the   
 1920's a sandstone wing in the same   
 style was built to the right.         
 Greenwich Hospital Estates purchased  
 the Hall after World War 2 and it was 
 then converted into 5 separate        
 dwelling houses.The stable block was  
 converted into 8 small houses and the 
 school which was originally for estate
 workers children is now a dwelling    
 house as is the estate fire station.
