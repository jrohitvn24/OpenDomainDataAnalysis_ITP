		<title>10Bridges at Haltwhistle.</title>
		<content>    There are three bridges across the 
 River Tyne:  The{Alston Arches}is a   
 viaduct.  This was used to carry the  
 railway from Haltwhistle to Alston.   
 The line is not used now.  There are 4
 arches on the weir and one arch on    
 either side.  Four of the large       
 pillars have an arch shaped space that
 was going to be used to build a       
 footbridge.                           
    The{old bridge}was built in 1875   
 so that people who lived on the other 
 side of the river could get to the    
 railway station.                      
    This bridge was not built for heavy
 lorries so bollards were put at each  
 end to stop the traffic using it.     
    The County Council built a{new     
{bridge}at the West End so that people 
 in Plenmeller have to come a lot      
 further to get into Haltwhistle. There
 is only room for one line of traffic. </content>
