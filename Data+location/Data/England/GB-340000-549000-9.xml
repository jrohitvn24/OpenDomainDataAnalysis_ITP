		<content> When we interviewed Mr.Leslie he was  
 very forthright on his views about    
 living in this area.He said that he   
 had been to every county in Britain   
 but he liked Cumbria the best.He said 
 that it was very quiet compared to    
 some areas and the pace of life was   
 leisurely.He could not think of a much
 healthier place to be and people      
 tended to live to a ripe old age here.
{**************************************
  When we asked him about changes in   
 his business in his lifetime he said  
 that it had improved in many ways     
 because people were more interested in
 gardening because more and more of    
 them were becoming home owners and    
 taking a pride in their gardens.More  
 also owned cars and were able to visit
 his nursery.The only change that he   
 disliked was the introduction of VAT  
 which he thought was a sheer nuisance.</content>
