 school until they were 15 yrs. old    
 whereas now they leave at age 11 yrs.

 winners in the Best Kept Village

 the Sussex Rural Community Council.

{BOXGROVE}has 138 council houses and 90
 private houses within the parish. An  
 interesting point being that there are
 no council houses on the East side of 
 the main road through the village (The
 Street).  There are two Farms, both of
 which were dairy farms until only 2 or
 3 yrs. ago.  Priory Farm is now an    
 arable Farm growing numerous crops.   
 Oil seed Rape, wheat, barley, oats,   
 and peas.  The peas grown are for next
 years seed. Boxgrove Farm also has    
 various crops growing in the fields.  </content>
