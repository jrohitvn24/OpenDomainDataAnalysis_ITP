		<content> The gardens and  grounds around       
 Normanby Hall have been developed as a
 Country Park covering some 168 acres  
 of wooded parkland.                   
 There is an aviary housing  British   
 and exotic birds.Part of the wooded   
 parkland is a deer park and there are 
 several very different nature trails  
 designed by a Countryside interpretive
 service whose staff are available to  
 help visitors.There is a pottery and a
 Smithy where work can be seen in      
 progress and purchases made.          
 The Park is the venue for many people 
 particularly at weekends when there is
 usually a local band playing.The Park 
 is also used by camping and           
 caravanning clubs who hold rallies    
 there.Horse riding events are also    
 held in the Park and the Hunter Trials
 attract competitors from a large area.
