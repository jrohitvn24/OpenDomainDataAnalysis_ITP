<title>21Up-date Half Moon Pub entry</title>
<content>

I was reading the article about the Half Moon pub and noticed that the landlord at the end of the 1970s was quoted as being "Cherry White"  He would love to read that I don't think!! The landlords name was Terry White!  I worked there from 1977 until 1980 cooking in the Kitchen whilst I was at Plumpton College as a student. There is a famous oil painting there of all the locals and I am in the painting.  It was done by local artist Dick Leach and was painted from individual photographs of each person.  The photos were taken of all of us individually in the pub and then painted separately onto the canvas by the artist.  I liked working there even though the Landlord was mostly grumpy to workfor but he was ok really!  I was 18 when I left.   &lt;br />
