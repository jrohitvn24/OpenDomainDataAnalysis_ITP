		<title>04Aughton Charity Litter Pick</title>
		<content> In June 1985 a group of school        
 children from Aston Comprehensive     
 School joined in a sponsored litter   
 pick in the Aughton area. It was to   
 tidy up our area and also to help old 
 people think differently about young  
 people. They did this by finding      
 sponsors from older residents to see  
 how much litter they could collect in 
 one large bag. It took place over two 
 hours on a Saturday morning.          
 Altogether they collected 37 large    
 bags of rubbish and nearly Â£100 in    
 sponsor money. The group of 23        
 children have decided that the money  
 they have raised should go towards    
 three causes: the Bradford fire       
 disaster, the Ethiopian famine and the
 Brussels football disaster. Their     
 efforts were also recorded in the     
 local newspaper,"The Rotherham        
 Advertiser".                          </content>
