		<content>  On Saturday afternoons we go to a    
 meeting of the{Field Society}which is 
 an organisation for people who are    
 interested in nature and wildlife. We 
 meet at Adastra Hall every second week
 of the month, then we walk or drive to
 places such as Wingshaven (bird       
 sanctury), Woods Mill (nature         
 conservancy) and we walk around and   
 visit lots of other interesting       
 places.                               
  My friend and I have belonged since  
 it began four years ago, but the      
 senior {Field Society}has been going  
 for a lot longer.  Reg Adsett usually 
 leads the walks or visits and Mrs.    
 Petrides always comes along with      
 us.                                   
  There was a competition to design    
 a badge for the junior section and we 
 won the competition.
