		<title>06Mr. Broome - A Bee-Keeper</title>
		<content>{Bees}have been kept in{Preston Brook  
 for about eighty-five years.          
                                       
 Mrs. Broomes' grandfather (Mr. P.J.   
 Webb) first kept bees at Canal House  
 about 200 yards from the Broomes'     
 present home. Their son took over in  
 1964 and he has continued the         
 tradition ever since.                 
                                       
 There are five hives in the garden of 
 the cottage, which was formerly the   
{Post Office and Telegraph Office}close
 to the Roman Road.                    
                                       
                                       
 Mr. Broome has acquired a detailed    
 knowledge of bees and gives lectures  
 on them to various groups like the    
 Women's Institutes.
