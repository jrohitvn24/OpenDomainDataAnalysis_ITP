		<content> of pessimism.Being fit and healthy is 
 an essential for rural living, so when
 the taking of long walks is no longer 
 possible they feel moving to Sherborne
 will be inevitable.                   
   As for the future of the village    
 they showed great concern.They hope   
 that it will remain unspoilt but fear 
 that with the impending sale of the   
 'big house',Compton Castle,changes    
 must take place.They fear that traffic
 will increase in the village and a new
 venture at the house could prove      
 detrimental to the rural peace e.g. a 
 residential retreat for those         
 recovering from mental illness or     
 perhaps a 'drying out' clinic.At best 
 they hope it will be sold as a country
 hotel or hospitality house for some   
 transnational company.                
   In conclusion they were well pleased
 with their retirement choice.         </content>
