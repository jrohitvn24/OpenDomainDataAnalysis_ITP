		<title>10The Free Church, St Ives</title>
		<content> The Free Church (United Reformed), is 
 situated in the Market Place of St    
 Ives, where it dominates the street   
 scene. In 1980 it underwent major     
 changes to its structure and its use. 
                                       
 A floor was built to produce upstairs 
 rooms and the church became a church  
 community centre. Organisations using 
 it have their own committees but the  
 centre has 2 full_time, 7 part_time   
 and 60 volunteer helpers. The warden  
 of the centre is the Minister,        
 assisted by the Community Minister.   
                                       
 The usual religious services take     
 place on Sundays, the Minister seeing 
 the religious and community aspects as
 one entity.
