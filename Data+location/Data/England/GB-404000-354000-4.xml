		<title>04Onecote Sunday School/Chapel</title>
		<content>     There is a Sunday School held in  
the old school buildings in Onecote.   
About 16 children attend on the three  
Sundays it is held each month. During  
the last 20 minutes the children join  
their parents in the church service and
are blessed before  singing the final  
hymn.                                  
                                       
{Onecote Chapel}                       
     The Methodist chapel in Onecote   
was built in 1822.  It is built of     
gritstone and has stained glass windows
throughout. There are two wardens who  
help the preacher.  The services are   
held every Sunday at 11 o'clock. The   
chapel will seat 90 people but only    
about 15 people regularly attend the   
services.  There is not a choir.       
     Last year there was one marriage, 
one funeral and no baptisms.
