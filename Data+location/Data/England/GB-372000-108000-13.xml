		<content>   Most people watch television for    
 pleasure. Gardening is very popular,  
 particularly amongst the older people.
 The church is very old and services   
 well attended. We have many clubs; the
 Mothers Union, Scouts, Brownies,      
 School PTA, and The Sunshine Club for 
 older people. Our small local public  
 house, The Antelope, seems popular,   
 and involves people in pub activities 
 like skittles, darts, dominoes, and   
 cards. Just outside our 'D' block, The
 Plumber Manor, where Cliff Richard has
 stayed, is well known for its fine    
 foods. To dine out, a villager has to 
 travel to a local inn or a nearby     
 town. The Fox at Ansty and the Green  
 Man at King's Stag have good          
 reputations. A small minority of      
 people are involved with horses. Few  
 participate in active games.
