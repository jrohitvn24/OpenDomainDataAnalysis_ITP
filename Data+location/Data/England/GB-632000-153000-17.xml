		<content> It appears that if a man and his dog  
 could be seen sitting on one of the   
 bridges in Mill Lane anyone seeing and
 passing them would find as they       
 crossed the next bridge that the same 
 man and his dog could be seen sitting 
 on that bridge also.                  
 A medium had to be forcibly restrained
 after going into a trance near Ham    
 Church. A young village child saw, on 
 two occasions, a "mad lady with       
 flowers" inside the church and the    
 crying of a child has been heard      
 coming from the church. A Grey Lady   
 has been seen wandering in the church-
 yard. She is said to be looking for a 
 child who drowned while in her care.  
 It is a fact that a child buried in   
 the church was "murdered by her nurse"
 who was later hanged at Maidstone and 
 that even on the hottest day the      
 church sometimes feels icy cold.      </content>
