		<title>03THE MOBILE LIBRARY VAN</title>
		<content>      A{Mobile Library Van}travels     
 around the{Saffron Walden}area four   
 times a week, on Mondays,Tuesdays,    
 Wednesdays and Thursdays.It is        
 serviced every eighth Friday.The      
 Library Van weighs 7.25 tons including
 the books.It is 8ft wide and 28ft long
 and has six wheels.It is designed so  
 that the driver does not need a Heavy 
 Goods Vehicle licence.                
      It serves 905 families altogether
 and there are approximately{1976}books
 on the van at any one time with       
 another{3730}out on loan.The Library  
 Van provides a very personal service  
 as the librarian knows most of her    
 customers and keeps books that she    
 thinks will interest them.This is a   
 particularly helpful service for old  
 people living in the outlying areas.
