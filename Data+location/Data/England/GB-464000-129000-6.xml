		<content> Because Council money can't provide   
 all the things school needs,parents   
 organise fund raising events.This year
 there has been an Antiques Road Show, 
 an auction,a fete and a Go-Kart Grand 
 Prix.These events have been supported 
 by all the village people.The fete was
 on June 29th,it was lovely weather and
 lots of people came.There were side   
 shows,strawberry cream teas,raffles &amp; 
 a BMX display team.The highlight was a
 Go-Kart race which local firms had    
 sponsored.Each childs Go-Kart,which   
 was home-made,had a driver and two    
 pushers and after time trials the     
 fastest Karts were in the final.The   
 circuit was the triangle round school.
 Three girls won the race.The fete     
 raised Â£329 from sponsors and Â£169    
 from the other attractions.School is  
 going to buy audio-visual equipment   
 with the money.                       </content>
