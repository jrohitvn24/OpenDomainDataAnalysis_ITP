In the Shrewley area itself there are  
not many clubs although there is a     
Parish Church and Youth Centre. There  
are however groups of Guides, Scouts,  
Brownies and Cubs in Hatton which meet 
in the Church Parish Room. There are   
also three Women Institutes. Their     
meetings are held once every month.    
                                       
Some women go to a womens club. Some   
people go to squash and swimming       
clubs. These  people have to travel to 
to do these hobbies.                   
                                       
One man is the Chairman of the Vintage 
Tractor and Machinery Society. He      
collects,repairs and restores old      
tractors which he keeps on his farm.   
This society does a lot of Charity     
work. There is one political group     
called the Conservative Association.   </content>
