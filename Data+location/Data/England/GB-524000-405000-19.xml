          The farms on the edge of the 
 town are used for a variety of{arable 
 farming, the chief crops being{wheat, 
{barley,}and{oil seed rape.}One field  
 only is{pasture.}Running through this 
 land is a track of a disused{railway  
 which used to run between{Grimsby}and 
{Louth.}The land itself is quite hilly 
 compared with the rest of our area and
 is crossed by pylons and a small      
 stream known as{'Buck Beck'.}Some of  
 the land has also been used to expand 
 the housing estate.                   
{Education.                            
{          }The{Fairfield}schools were 
 built in{1968.}There is both a{First  
 and a{Middle}school on the same site. 
 Children attend these two schools     
 between the ages of{5}years and{12    
 years. Then they go to a{Secondary    
 school until the age of{16}years.     </content>
