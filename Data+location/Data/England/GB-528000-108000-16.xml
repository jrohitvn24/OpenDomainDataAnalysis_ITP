		<title>16PATCHAM COURT FARM</title>
		<content> There has been a farm here since the  
 original Domesday Book was written.At 
 present the farm covers 350 acres.    
 Nowadays the farm is mainly a dairy   
 farm  although some crops are         
 grown.However the prices farmers get  
 for milk products have been falling   
 during the last few years because of  
 the Common Agricultural Policy agreed 
 by the Common Market countries. This  
 means that the number of cows kept for
 milking have been falling over the    
 past few years. At present 390 cows   
 are kept of which 85 cows are actually
 being milked.  The milk used to be    
 collected by a lorry.Nowadays it is   
 stored in a large tank which can hold 
 up to 45 litres. The change was made  
 for reasons of hygiene.The cows are   
 milked twice a day.
