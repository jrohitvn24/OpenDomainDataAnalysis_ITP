		<content> The river Ouse grows from two tiny    
 water falls in the nearby village of  
 Slaugham,into a tidal river reaching  
 the sea at Newhaven.The stream is     
 already several metres wide when it   
 flows under the Staplefield - Cuck-   
 field road at Hamerhill bridge        
 formerly knowan as Gastons bridge. The
 Garston family was documented in 1296,
 but the name was corrupted to Gasson  
 by 1823 and is still common locally.  
 Cultivations near the south bank still
 expose black earth indicating iron    
 working in the past.The river can be  
 reached at several points by public   
 footpaths as it flows through arable  
 fields.In the river Millers Thumb or  
 Bullhead fish can be found,and in its 
 wooded banks live Water Voles. The    
 river is over 3 m. wide as it passes  
 beneath Upper and Lower Pilstye bridg-
 es towards the Ouse railway viaduct.  </content>
