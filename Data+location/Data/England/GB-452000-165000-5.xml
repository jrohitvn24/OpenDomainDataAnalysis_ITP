		<title>05ORDNANCE DEPOT, THATCHAM.</title>
		<content> We went to visit the Ordnance Depot   
 in Station Rd. (map reference 578664).
 The administrative officer, Mrs.      
 Holden took us on a tour of the depot.
 We discovered that the depot was      
 established in 1940 by the British    
 Government as a General stores and    
 during the war was handed over to     
 the U.S.A.army.In 1946 the depot was  
 handed back to the R.A.O.C. at which  
 time there were 800 Americans,600     
 civilians and 2,000 prisoners of war. 
 We saw army helmets, sleeping bags,   
 canoes, climbing equipment, skis and a
 model army tank, in fact everything   
 needed to furnish a soldier's home  or
 for use in the army's adventure       
 training. We also saw a policeman and 
 one of the dogs that help to guard the
 depot. 271 people work there,         
 approximately half of them women.
