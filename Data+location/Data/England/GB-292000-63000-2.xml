		<title>02Torquay Population</title>
		<content>    Torquay has a very large number of 
 residents who are from other parts of 
 the British Isles as well as from     
 other countries.A large proportion of 
 these have settled here on retirement.
    Many hoteliers,shop keepers and    
 restaurant owners and workers are from
 outside the area.                     
    There are also a number of migrant 
 workers who come to the area for      
 seasonal holiday work.                
    The requirements of the elderly    
 residents particularly their medical  
 needs has led to an expansion of      
 hospital facilities and the           
 establishment of many private         
 residential homes.                    
    There are still many people who can
 claim to be Devon locals however.Many 
 of these live in the older parts of   
 the town and the old village centres  
 which are now suburban Torquay.       </content>
