		<content> Both the local{M.P. and M.E.P.}make   
 occasional visits to the village but  
 contact is mainly by letter. The      
{County Council}Representative is a    
 farmer from Hillborough (Conservative)
 and the{District Councillor}(Cons)    
 owns an engineering company in the    
 village.                              
 There is an active{Parish Council}of 7
 members and it is non-political. The  
 council is responsible for Street     
 Lights, Footpaths, hiring of          
 Allotments etc, and puts the village  
 view to the District and County       
 Councils. Currently one of their main 
 concerns is a pavement from the       
 Swaffham Rd. Council Houses to church 
 St. They meet once a month in the     
 Community Centre and regularly invite 
 members of the village to come to     
 meetings to "air" their views.
