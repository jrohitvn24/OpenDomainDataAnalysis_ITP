		<title>19Summary:Hadleigh</title>
		<content>The Data was collected by children     
between the ages of 7 and 11 and they  
were generally allowed to choose their 
own subjects. They have tended to be   
very unimaginative in their choice of  
issues and very "middle-class"in out-  
look.Nobody thought it necessary to    
write about the May Show,the big event 
of Hadleigh's year,and one child had to
be primed to do so.                    
The children are not "socially aware"; 
many of them wrote about their streets 
by saying "My street is nice/long/good/
pretty."No-one mentioned the footpath  
controversy,no-one talked about the    
renovation of the many old buildings.  
But this is representative of life in  
Hadleigh generally - the population    
are middle class in outlook,slow and   
satisfied - in fact typical of a       
Suffolk country town.
