<title>37A day in the life</title>
<content>

Today I woke up and went downstairs and went to get some breakfast.  I had Cheerios.  I was so scared as today I was in a Kung Fu tournament.  It started at 11 am and finished at 5pm.&lt;br />&lt;br />It was 10am, I needed to get dressed so I woke up my dad.  He said “Quick get your belt.”  So I got it and we left.  &lt;br />&lt;br />The first match was against a Chinese boy.  I won.  There were lots of matches, I won all of mine.&lt;br />&lt;br />It was the final against a Russian.  In the first round he knocked me down but I got back up.  In the second round I was angry so I hit him in the stomach and the face.  The referee said enough,  it was a T.K.O. I won my knuckles were hurting badley.&lt;br />&lt;br />when we got home I ran up stairs and went to bed.&lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
