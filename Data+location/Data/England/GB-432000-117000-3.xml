		<title>03GEOLOGY/ECOLOGY:TEST VALLEY</title>
		<content>  The rocks underlying the Test valley 
 are recent soft sedimentary rocks.They
 are formed from clay,sands and gravels
 and give rise to not very fertile     
 soils,some of which are very dry.     
  There is much natural woodland in the
 area which lies to the north_east of  
 the New Forest.Today the steeper      
 slopes are still covered in woods     
 because it is difficult to farm these 
 areas.                                
  The woodland is mixed:there are many 
 native types of tree such as oak,holly
 hazel,birch and pine.                 
  There is much wildlife in the area   
 and the river Test is famous for its  
 fishing.The river is carefully managed
 by Broadlands Estate.
