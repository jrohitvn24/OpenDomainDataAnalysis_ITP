		<title>04THE WALKER IN ARUNDEL PARK</title>
		<content> Arundel Park, a large area of enclosed
 downland offers beautiful surroundings
 for the walker. Part of the main      
 valley contains Swanbourne Lake which 
 is served by many springs of clear    
 water. In parts swampy edges provide  
 the environment for water plants and  
 many birds frequent the lake, some    
 being escapees from the Wildfowl      
 Reserve nearby. A path encircles the  
 lake, sometimes rising above the level
 of the lake. Trees grow close to the  
 water or give way to show the grassy  
 slopes of the Downland, where sheep   
 graze. Woods cover the western slopes,
 predominantly beeches which give in   
 Autumn carpets of yellow and red      
 leaves. Plantations of mixed trees and
 one or two groups of pines add charac-
 ter to the landscape and extensive    
 views are revealed of the surrounding 
 countryside as far as the sea.        </content>
