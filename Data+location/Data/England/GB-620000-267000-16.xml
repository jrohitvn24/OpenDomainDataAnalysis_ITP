		<content>Q1What part has Worlingworth played in 
your life?                             
A1We raised our family here.All went to
the village school &amp; the Baptist Chapel
at Horham.The farm has expanded from   
105 to 400 acres &amp; is now a partnership
Q2How has it changed over the years?   
A2Farming has changed.Everybody used to
walk or cycle but now they have cars &amp; 
go on holidays.When I came in 1943 I   
knew everybody but now people move in &amp;
out &amp; you never get to know them.      
Q3What in your opinion does the future 
hold for Worlingworth &amp; the surrounding
villages?                              
A3Smaller work force,smaller families, 
longer lifespan &amp; just old people left 
in the villages.
