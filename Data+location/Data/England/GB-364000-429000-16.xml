		<content> The houses round where I live are all 
 private houses with garages and       
 gardens back and front.There are three
 types of houses on our road, link     
 detached, dormer bungalows and semi   
 detached bungalows. Some houses are   
 made of brick, others brick with wood 
 boarding, and some have pebble-dashed 
 walls. The houses have either two or  
 three bedrooms , bathrooms and toilets
 upstairs. Downstairs there is a       
 kitchen, a dining room, a lounge and  
 in some houses there is a cloakroom   
 and toilet. The older houses in the   
 area all have chimneys but our house  
 was built in 1975 and as the area was 
 a smokeless zone no chimneys were     
 built on the modern houses. The houses
 are usually heated by gas (from the   
 North Sea) or electricity and the     
 majority have central heating.
