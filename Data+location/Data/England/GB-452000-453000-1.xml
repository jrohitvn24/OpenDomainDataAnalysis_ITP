		<content>   This block is situated two or three 
 miles North-West of the city of{York} 
 straddling the A59 road and the BR    
 line from{York}to{Knaresborough.}     
   The terrain in this block is almost 
 completely flat, dominated by the     
 bleak{Scagglethorpe Moor}and drained{ 
 by{The Foss}a tributary stream of the 
{River Ouse}which also flows across the
 North-East corner of the block on its 
 way into the centre of York.          
   There are two small hamlets in the  
 South-West corner of the block:{High  
{Moor}and{Hessay.}The larger village of
{Upper Poppleton}is situated on the    
 Eastern boundary of the block which   
 roughly coincides with the border     
 between{Upper}and{Nether Poppleton.}
