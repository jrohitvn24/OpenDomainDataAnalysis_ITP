		<content> Apart from scattered farms, the       
 hamlets of Duloe, Staploe and Honeydon
 follow their respective brooks, with  
 no obvious village centre. Duloe on   
 higher ground above Duloe Brook, is   
 grouped at a crossroads, then resumes 
 the single file pattern along the St. 
 Neots Road. Designating this an       
 agricultural Priority Area, the County
 Structure Plan states "there is no    
 scope for development not proven      
 essential in the interests of         
 agriculture".                         
 Staploe is the largest hamlet with 40 
 houses, 17 owner occupied, 15 council 
 premises, 5 tied cottages, 3 rented.  
 Duloe with 22 houses; 9 owned, 10     
 council (6 have been bought), 1 tied, 
 1 rented.                             
 Honeydon with 31 houses; 11 owned,18  
 tied, 2 rented. Honeydon is heavily   
 farm based compared to elsewhere.     </content>
