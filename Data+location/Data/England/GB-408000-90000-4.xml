		<title>04A DAY IN A LIFE</title>
		<content> I have lived in Bournemouth all of my 
 life.  I have been on holiday twice   
 out of Bournemouth but I have never   
 been abroad.                          
                                       
 On a school day we have five lessons  
 which last for fifty-five minutes     
 each.  My form teacher is Miss Little 
 and I help her whenever she asks me,  
 most of the time I take the register  
 to the Secretary and collect the      
 credits for the rest of the class.  I 
 take a packed lunch to school         
 everyday, I have sandwiches, crisps   
 which I eat at break in the morning,  
 biscuits and cakes. I take a drink of 
 orange juice in a flask. I have been  
 to several different schools before   
 coming to Avonbourne, my Junior School
 was called Summerbee.
