		<content> A SUMMARY OF THE COASTAL STRIP BETWEEN
 GREAT YARMOUTH AND CAISTER-ON-SEA     
   This, almost entirely flat land, is 
 a division between the town of Gt.    
 Yarmouth, and the village of          
 Caister-on-sea. the area includes the 
 Southern third of Caister; the suburbs
 of Newtown, at the Northern end of GT.
 Yarmouth;and about 1.5 square Km. of  
 land between the two. At present, the 
 open-space in this area provides      
 important land for leisure.Facilities 
 include Bure Park,a Golfcourse,a      
 Racecourse and a large Caravan Holiday
 Park. There are also two Heliports    
 which serve North Sea Oil platforms.  
   This is a coastal srip with an area 
 of Coastal Marram Grass covered dunes,
 and a continuous stretch of beach with
 small tidal rise and fall, but strong 
 current.
