		<content>The church is called St Mary's and All 
Saints,the original being wooden.Parts 
of the present church are Norman the   
building having been added to over the 
years.The now blocked main door was at 
the base of the tower.There is a window
in its place.The church is built of    
sandstone,some of the stone coming from
older churches.The south side has      
battlements at the edge of the roof and
the north  side a sloping roof.The     
tower has pinnacles on each corner and 
a weather cock.The blue clock face is  
on the south side.A virginia creeper   
growing on the south wall was planted  
by Mr Winzer,who was coachman to the   
Rev.Burton,before the First World War. 
Outside the church the blocks of stone 
used as lamp posts were brought from   
Hollies Quarry at nearby Gnosall.In the
churchyard there is the restored base  
of the 14th century churchyard cross.  </content>
