		<content> We had to climb up about one hundred  
 spiral steps to get to the top of     
 St Michael's Church,{Fobbing.}We      
 looked}though our binoculars and we   
 could see a clearing in{Wat Tyler     
{Country Park,}here a pill box         
 stands.Pill boxes were built during   
 the second world war to defend the    
 coast against the Germans.In a field  
 we saw some cows, sheep and horses    
 grazing.In{Pitsea}there are two tips. 
 One is the council tip which takes    
 industrial rubbish,the other tip is   
 the GLC tip which takes household     
 rubbish.By the marshes there is a     
 cricket and a football pitch.From the 
 top of the tower we could see two or  
 three mustard fields.The tower was    
 21.34 metres high.The main thing we   
 saw up the tower was Fobbing marshes  
 which took up a large amount of land  
 in our area.                          </content>
