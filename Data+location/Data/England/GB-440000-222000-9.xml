		<content> Our area includes parts of the        
 following parishes:                   
 Wootton                               
 Steeple Barton                        
 Steeple Aston                         
 Rousham                               
 Tackley.                              
 None of them has an incumbent for whom
 that parish is his sole               
 responsibility, so there is not always
 a service every Sunday. More and more 
 rural parishes are being joined       
 together for lack of clergy; and lack 
 of money to keep them going as        
 separate entities. As the rural       
 population decreases, so too do the   
 congregations of the churches and so  
 does the parish income.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
