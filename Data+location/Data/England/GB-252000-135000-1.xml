		<content>     The block covered in this survey  
 is basically farmland with a few      
 scattered villages.Most of the land is
 covered in grass which is used for    
 sheep or cows.Nearly all the fields   
 are surrounded by hedges as are the   
 many small lanes which are only wide  
 enough to take one car.               
    The villages and hamlets are very  
 small and most of the people work in  
 Barnstaple or further afield.Almost   
 all the houses are very individual    
 with large gardens.                   
    There are very few amenities only  
 one bus service,one post office and   
 one pub.The churches and church hall  
 serve as general meeting places for   
 clubs and organisations.Apart from    
 building,converting and repairing,    
 industry other farming is             
 non_existant.
