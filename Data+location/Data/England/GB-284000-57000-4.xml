		<title>04CARNIVAL WEEK</title>
		<content> Carnival week is the first week of    
 August.                               
    All through the week there are     
 celebrations. All the money raised    
 goes to the Village Hall to pay for   
 the up-keep of it. There are coffee   
 mornings and jumble sales.            
   In the Carnival Procession there are
 lots of floats like "The Old Woman who
 Lived in the Shoe."                   
    We have a Carnival Queen, Princess 
 and four attendants. I was once an    
 attendant. We lead the procession. We 
 go twice around the Village; while we 
 go around people throw money on to the
 floats. After they have gone round    
 twice there is a disco on the School  
 Field. There are hot-dogs and games,  
 lots of drinks and food. There is a   
 man who puts on dancing music. The    
 disco finishes at 10 o'clock. It's    
 always a lovely Carnival Week. NICOLA.</content>
