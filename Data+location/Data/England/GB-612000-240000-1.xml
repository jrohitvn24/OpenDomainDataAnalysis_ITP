		<content>The Northern part of the area consists 
mainly of residential buildings on two 
estates, one private and one council,on
the outskirts of Ipswich.  The Southern
sector is made up of park land and     
arable farmland.                       
During the course of the survey 167    
households replied to questionnaires   
sent out by the pupils of five schools.
Results were recorded under the follow-
ing headings:                          
RECREATION, CLUBS, ENTERTAINMENT,MEDIA,
HOLIDAYS, HOME LIFE, COMMUNICATIONS,   
TRANSPORT, EDUCATION, TRADE, RELIGION, 
HEALTH.                                
Respondents were also invited to write 
comments on any LOCAL CONCERNS.        
The next pages summarise the findings  
of the questionnaire; remaining pages  
highlight the character of the area and
include contributions from local       
children.     Peter Payn, Stoke High.  </content>
