		<content> Once you're in you can't get out      
 Unless you turn around,               
 Once you're in you can't get out      
 Unless you do the splits,             
 Once you're in you can't get out      
 Unless you count to six               
 Twice you're in etc.continue up to 10 
                                       
            STONES                     
    First you get 4 or 5 stones and    
 pile them up.  We play 4 people, 2    
 each team.  One of the team throws the
 ball at the stones to knock them down.
  When you've knocked them down you run
 while the other team get the ball but 
 they can't run with it so they pass it
 to each other and try to hit the      
 opposite team with it.  Meanwhile the 
 other team try to pile the stones up. 
 If they do without getting hit they   
 shout "STONES".  You carry on till    
 they hit you, then you change over.   </content>
