		<title>10MODERN TECH/NEW DEVELOPMENT</title>
		<content> Today's idea of modern technology is  
 usually linked with computers in some 
 form. The IBM company has its main    
 offices based in Chiswick. Most of the
 hardware they deal with is in the form
 of mainframe computers. A visit to the
 building gives you a chance to compare
 the school's micros with the machines 
 there.                                
                                       
 Not only are there developments in    
 technology but also in the leisure    
 industry. A new leisure complex is    
 being constructed on the site of the  
 old Brentford open market. It is      
 scheduled to be completed some time in
 1986. The complex will have the usual 
 facilities, eg:- various courts, gyms 
 and swimming pools. Such a facility   
 has been lacking in this area and the 
 whole community will benefit greatly  
 from it.                              </content>
