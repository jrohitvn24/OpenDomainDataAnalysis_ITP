<title>21Changing Woolton Village Liverpool</title>
<content>

Since the 1980's Woolton Village has changed. Now we have Tesco on the old Bear Brand Site . St Marys catholic school has become a private nursery and the school moved to Much Woolton School. Calverts interior designs has become a betting shop, Ethel Austins has closed down, the baths have been closed all winter and might not reope due to government cuts. there is a tea rooms called Fletchers and a bridal wear shop where the dry cleaners used to be. Woolton Cinema closed but is open again and the Elephant  pubchanged to 'the crocodile' but changed back. The Coach and Horses Pub is changing into a childrens nursery. There is a Farmers Market the second Saturday of the month. Woolton has also won gold medal for Britain in bloom. Long may the village prosper.   &lt;br />
