		<content> Holy Trinity Church, Takeley, lies to 
 the west of the village where it has  
 stood for over 800 years.  Takeley    
 Free Church stands in the heart of the
 village and All Saints Little Canfield
 stands all alone and isolated amidst  
 the fields of wheat, barley and beans.
 Congregations have fallen over the    
 years, but recently the appointment of
 a new Rector to the parishes of       
 Takeley and Little Canfield has       
 coincided with an increase in the     
 numbers of people attending church    
 services.  This is particularly       
 noticeable amongst the very young and 
 the younger families.  A good omen for
 the future.
