		<content> Of the 600 responses to the           
 questionnaire the following is a      
 breakdown of the housing stock of the 
 area.  In the Framwellgate Moor and   
 Newton Hall areas half of the housing 
 stock is privately owned,             
 semi-detached, three bedroomed        
 with garages.  One quarter of the     
 stock is council owned, three         
 bedroomed semis - recently            
 refurbished.  The remaining stock in  
 Framwellgate Moor and Newton Hall is  
 made up of a) inter-war semis, b) link
 detached, c) detached or d) bungalows 
 built in the 1960's and 1970's.  There
 are very few flats or old style       
 cottages.  In the centre of           
 Framwellgate Moor and in Pity Me there
 is a small number of terraced houses. 
 The vast bulk of property in the area 
 is privately owned.
