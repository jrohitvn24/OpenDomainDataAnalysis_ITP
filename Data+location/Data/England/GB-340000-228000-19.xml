		<content> The large areas of farm and woodland  
 are ideal for the pursuit of{country  
{sports}which include{mink and fox     
{hunting, partridge and pheasant       
{shooting, and trout fishing.          
 Whitfield and Kenchurch estates have  
 large syndicate shoots over much of   
 the area and work in harmony with     
 local farmers, many of whom are       
 personally involved in the            
 organisation of the shoots. The       
{gamekeepers}are useful too, as they   
 control the vermin which helps to     
 protect crops and livestock.          
                                       
 Another physical activity is{football.
 A local team plays matches during the 
 winter on a pitch, normally inhabited 
 by a flock of sheep, at Howton Farm.  
 Fortunately the sheep don't seem      
 to mind sharing their grazing each    
 Sunday afternoon !                    </content>
