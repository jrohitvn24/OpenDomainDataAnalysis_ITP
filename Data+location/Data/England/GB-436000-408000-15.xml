		<title>15MONK BRETTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content> I'm Kate Harris and I have been chosen
 to write about my village,{Monk       
{Bretton.}The{village}is growing all   
 the time with{buildings}going up on   
 every available patch of land.        
 We do have{park}which has a{few swings
 but it suffers from{vandalism.}The    
{library}does offer some recreation    
 along with the{cricket club}for the   
 boys but there is very{little}in the  
 way of{amenities.                     
 There are quite a few{shops, butcher, 
{baker}but no{candlestick maker!}We are
 soon to have a{chemist's shop}in the  
 village - about time too. People who  
 had a prescription from the village   
 doctor had to go 3 miles in to town.  
 I like Monk Bretton; it's a{cosy place
 with{old people}talking to{young ones 
 and{Pc Pearson}on his beat helping    
 anyone he can and making sure the     
 hooligans behave.                     </content>
