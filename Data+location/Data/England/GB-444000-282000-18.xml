		<title>18Monks Kirby's transport.</title>
		<content> The Fosse Way runs down the west side 
 of this Domesday Block.Further north  
 the A5. crosses the Fosse Way, these  
 are the main arterial roads for       
 traffic going to and from the M1. and 
 M6.                                   
  Most of the families in Monks Kirby  
 run their own car,only a few rely upon
 the public transport which serves the 
 village four times a day.Just south of
 the block in the village of Pailton   
 are coach companies which together    
 provide the main transport for the    
 school children of Brockhurst Middle  
 school and it's three feeder first    
 schools.                              
  Within a 30 to 45 minute drive are   
 the railway stations of Rugby and     
 Coventry.Close by are the airports of 
 Coventry, Castle Donnington and       
 Birmingham.
