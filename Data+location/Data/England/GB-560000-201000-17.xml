		<content> Councillor Mrs.Hobbs has told us a{   
 history of a few of Blackmore's       
 changes.One of them was the building  
 of the new hall and estates.The old   
 hall was originally two army huts by  
 the roundabout. Blackmore has         
 expanded.In 1961-1971 the populations 
 were respectively 1,507 and 3,268.The 
 new developments in{housing}were      
 Meadow Rise named after a meadow,     
 Orchard Piece,which was an orchard and
 Woollard Way after Jim Woollard the   
 builder.Later two smaller developments
 were built,Poplar Close, and Jericho  
 Place . Children went to the 1877     
 built school until 1966 when a new    
 school was erected. The recreation    
 field was once{allotments}which cost  
 12\p a year.People continued to rent  
 this land until there were only two   
 allotments left. These were sold and  
 the{recreation field}developed.       </content>
