		<content>  This D-block is mainly rural,the land
 being used for grazing or hay and     
 silage.The villages of Cononley,      
 Lothersdale and Cowling are on the    
 edge of the block.                    
 Surgill Beck runs through the         
 area which is quite hilly, comprising 
 Cononley Moor, Glusburn Moor and      
 Cowling Hill.The area is served by the
 A6068 Colne-Keighley road and the     
 Leeds-Carlisle railway.The Pennine Way
 runs through Lothersdale.             
   Evidence of previous industry are   
 Cononley leadmines,disused textile    
 mills and an earthworks.There is      
 little present industry so it is      
 necessary for people to commute to    
 Keighley or Skipton.Each village has a
 few shops of its own but the nearest  
 main shopping centres are Keighley,   
 Skipton or Colne.
