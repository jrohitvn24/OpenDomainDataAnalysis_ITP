		<title>07The Village Hall,OLD</title>
		<content>   The Village Hall is being decorated 
 this year.It is hoped it will become a
 focal point of village life and help  
 foster a community spirit.At the      
 moment it is used regularly by a {Mums
{and Todlers }group and by the {Women's
{Institute. }Whist Drives and Barn     
 Dances  are held there occasionally.  
 The Youth Club folded recently through
 lack of support.                      
                                       
  A committee has been set up to       
 promote the use of the hall and       
 attempt to make it an important       
 meeting centre in the village as it   
 once was.There are problems with this 
 as most people in the village seek    
 entertainment away from Old.
