		<title>13CARE OF THE ELDERLY</title>
		<content> There are some{council bungalows}for  
 old people, some connected by bell to 
 a warden controlled unit. These       
 residents can summon help by using    
 their bells.                          
 The{meals on wheels}service delivers  
 hot meals from Frampton House kitchen 
 unit to elderly people in the area who
 have been recommended by their doctors
 as likely to benefit from such help.  
 At Christmas time all receive a       
 traditional dinner of turkey and plum 
 pudding. Meals are delivered by       
 voluntary car drivers.                
 The housebound elderly are provided   
 with a{library service}when volunteers
 take a selection of books from the    
 local library for people to make their
 own choice.
