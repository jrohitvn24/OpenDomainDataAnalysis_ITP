		<title>11NEW HOUSING DEVELOPMENT</title>
		<content> Because of a higher{employment}rate   
 than the national average the         
{population}is increasing in this area.
 To cope with the increased demand for 
{housing}a typical new estate is being 
 built in Townhill park.               
 Most dwellings are semi_detached and  
 have only two bedrooms but some have  
 3 The houses are usually built in the 
 timber framed style and are normally  
 priced between Â£25.000 and Â£30.000    
 (July 1985).                          
 In this estate, as in most others in  
 the area, there are ample areas for   
{recreation}and children's play areas. 
 Each house has a garden and some of   
 the larger houses have garages.       
 Street lamps light roads so that car  
 drivers can see if there are any      
 children running around on the road.  
 Most new houses  have got central     
 heating.                              </content>
