		<title>17Bank and Gritnam</title>
		<content> The village of Bank is very small and 
 consists of very few houses.   In     
 total there are 19 houses, 1 Public   
 House and a large mansion which has   
 been made into 10 flats.   The house  
 is called Amsley House.   The rest of 
 the houses are quite large and there  
 are also some cottages.   The houses  
 in both Bank and Gritnam originate    
 from the 16th to 17th century.        
 The hamlet of Gritnam lies about \ km 
 south of Bank along a narrow track.   
 The hamlet opens onto the forest and  
 there are 6 cottages.   All the people
 have lived in the forest all their    
 lives.   They all work in the forest  
 and surrounding areas.   There are no 
 shops or amenities of any kind for a  
 couple of miles.   All of the houses  
 have very large gardens which are used
 mainly for growing vegetables.
