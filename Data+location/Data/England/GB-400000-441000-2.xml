		<title>02THE NORTH-WEST VIEW.</title>
		<content>  Looking north-west from the highest  
 point,the overall view is one of hills
 and valleys.                          
 Directly northwards the entire town of
 Silsden can be seen.The mills are     
 concentrated in the centre with large 
 housing estates extending to either   
 side.Behind Silsden is the faint      
 outline of Great Whernside.           
 Farnhill and Kildwick can be seen to  
 the N.W. and Kildwick Hall is clearly 
 visible at night when it is lit up.   
 Farnhill Pinnacle can be seen on top  
 of the hill and looking further west, 
 Cowling Pinnacle is visible.          
 Looking West one can see the peaks of 
 the Yorkshire Dales including         
 Pen-y-ghent which is 2273ft.Also      
 visible is the end of the glaciated   
 Aire Valley and part of Skipton.The   
 further west one travels,the more     
 rural the area becomes.               </content>
