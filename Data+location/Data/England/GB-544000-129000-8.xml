		<title>08ASHDOWN FOREST LIFE AND WORK</title>
		<content> Very few people live or work here. The
 two private estates of Old Lodge and  
 Pippingford Park each consist of a    
 large house with farmland and cottages
 for workers. Much of Pippingford is   
 used by the Ministry of Defence. There
 are some smaller farms and small-     
 holdings. Though isolated, the people 
 seemed content. The land is only fit  
 for grazing or perhaps producing wood 
 for fencing etc. The radio masts,     
 visible for miles around, belong to   
 the former Diplomatic Corps Radio     
 Station, important in the Second World
 War and later in transmitting the BBC 
 World Service. The Station is no      
 longer in use, its staff reduced to   
 lO, and the only living creatures to  
 be seen are Highland cattle which     
 graze the enclosed area and are       
 looked after by the wife of one of the
 Rangers.                              </content>
