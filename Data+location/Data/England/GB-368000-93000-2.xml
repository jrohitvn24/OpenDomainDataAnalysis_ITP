		<content>  The area is very sparsely populated, 
 and the majority of buildings are     
 connected with farming.               
  In the main, cottages and farms have 
 retained their character. Flint and   
 brick banding can be seen on older    
 farmhouses, but there are also one or 
 two more modern buildings.            
  A thatched house, an old toll cottage
 on the Old Sherborne Road, plus the   
 slate roofed farm cottages of red     
 brick ensure that the presence of     
 architecture in the landscape remains 
 a delightful blending of styles rather
 than the intrusive eyesores so often  
 encountered in an otherwise beautiful 
 rural area.                           
  Sadly, some farm cottages are showing
 signs of neglect. Modern machinery has
 meant a reduction in the number of    
 farm workers, and their accommodation 
 is no longer required.                </content>
