		<title>03HAMBLEDON HILL NEAR SHROTON</title>
		<content>  IN THE LAST 20 YEARS{ARCHAEOLOGISTS  
 HAVE EXCAVATED THIS HILL AND FOUND    
 OBJECTS LEFT BY EARLY MAN. THERE WERE 
 TOOLS, BONES AND THE FOUNDATIONS OF   
 HUTS THAT WERE ONCE PROTECTED BY THE  
 HIGH RAMPARTS WHICH SURROUND THE HILL.
{IRON AGE MAN}KNEW THAT HIS ENEMIES    
 COULD NOT REACH HIM UP HERE IF THEY   
 HAD TO CROSS THESE RIDGES MADE OUT OF 
 THE CHALK. UP HERE HE COULD LIVE      
 SAFELY AND WATCH FOR ANYONE           
 APPROACHING THROUGH THE SURROUNDING   
 FORESTS.                              
{ OLIVER CROMWELL}ALSO FOUGHT A BATTLE 
 HERE AGAINST THE DORSET CLUBMEN IN THE
 CIVIL WAR. AFTER HIS VICTORY HE LOCKED
 400 PRISONERS IN SHROTON CHURCH FOR   
 THE NIGHT.                            
{ GENERAL WOLFE}WHO CAPTURED QUEBEC FOR
 THE BRITISH TRAINED HIS ARMY HERE AND 
 THEY CAMPED AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL,  
 THE AREA NOW CALLED SHROTON LINES.    </content>
