		<content> Tynemouth offers a wide range of      
 recreational facilities to its        
 residents and to visitors. There are a
 number of beaches, the biggest of     
 which is Long Sands - a wide expanse  
 of sand which is very popular. There  
 is not great deal of entertainment for
 visitors but there is a small theatre,
 the Priory Theatre, which is always   
 well-supported. Various sports are    
 catered for in the two public parks - 
 Northumberland Park and Tynemouth Park
 - Tennis and bowls being popular in   
 the summer. Golf can be played at     
 Tynemouth Golf Club. For siling       
 enthusiasts there are sailing events  
 staged by Tynemouth Sailing Club at   
 the Haven.
