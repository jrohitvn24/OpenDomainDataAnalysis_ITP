		<title>02FARMING AROUND RINGSTEAD</title>
		<content>  Parts of three farms make up this    
 area.The crops grown are wheat (65%), 
 sugar beet (20%) and barley (15%)     
  The sugar beet is transported to the 
 King's Lynn factory during the        
 "campaign" for processing.            
  There appears to have been a         
 conscious effort to conserve and even 
 re-instate hedges,and apart from      
 slight re-adjustments brought about by
 different farming needs,eg.smaller    
 lambing areas are not now needed,the  
 field sizes have not been increased   
 and are usually about 40 acres,so     
 preserving the traditional appearance.
  Some beef cattle are kept namely     
 Hereford and Hereford cross,but       
 changes are taking place and new herds
 are not established.                  
  A nursary is situated in Ringstead   
 which sells direct to the public both 
 on site and at local market towns.    </content>
