		<title>18SURNAMES SURVEY IN OGBOURNE</title>
		<content> On this survey we were trying to find 
 out about whether any surnames had    
 stayed the same since the{1881 census 
 in Rockley, Ogbourne St Andrew and    
 Ogbourne Maizey.To do this we asked   
 questions like "What is your surname?"
 and "Where were you born?" We found   
 that many families had died out either
 because the family had many daughters 
 and the name died, or a couple died   
 who did not have any children to pass 
 on the family name.                   
  Some interviewers met little luck in 
 finding people to interview as many   
 people were out working, and were told
 by the vicar that it was a very       
 wealthy village and many people worked
 in Swindon or London and commuted     
 regularly.The surname "Cannings"      
 cropped up many times in the church   
 but this family seems to have died out
 now.                                  </content>
