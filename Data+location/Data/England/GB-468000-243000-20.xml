		<title>20Grafton Hunt and Paulerspury</title>
		<content>The Grafton Hunt kennels, built in     
1890, are in Paulerspury and house 60  
hounds and 12 horses.  The puppies are 
born in the summer and when weaned are 
sent to farms to be looked after until 
they are 12 months old.  The following 
winter they go out with the hunt for   
the first time.  The hounds are fed on 
raw meat which costs about 8 pounds per
hound per week.                        
                                       
CREDITS  Data collection was by the    
         children of Paulerspury and   
         Whittlebury schools assisted  
         by staff, parents and friends.
         The photographs were taken by 
         a Whittlebury parent, Mr M.   
         Southerden, and a Paulerspury 
         teacher, John Marshall.
