		<title>05Garston Bus Garage</title>
		<content>There are over 100 buses in Garston bus
garage.  They are single decker and    
double decker buses and coaches. There 
are 300 people who work there. The     
buses travel all over Watford and some 
go into London and other large towns   
such as Luton and the city of St       
Albans. The weather affects the number 
of people who use the buses. In winter 
more people use the local services.    
There are 34 bus stops in Garston. The 
busiest day is Friday when more people 
travel by bus to the shops in Watford. 
In the school holidays they have some  
problems with children writing on the  
seats and refusing to pay fares. The   
fare for a child from Garston to       
Watford centre is 22 pence.  A lot of  
old people use the bus to travel into  
Watford using a special bus pass.
