		<title>05THROWLEY SCHOOL GARDEN</title>
		<content> Throwley is a school in the country-  
 side. All the children enjoy being    
 involved in gardening.                
   We have a shed for all the gardening
 tools, and a greenhouse for raising   
 seedlings such as lettuce and         
 tomatoes.                             
   We planted wallflowers, onions and  
 broadbeans last Autumn. This Summer we
 are growing runner beans,marrows,     
 cucumbers, spring onions, peas,       
 potatoes,lettuce, carrots,beetroot,   
 turnip,sweet peas, radishes and       
 tomatoes.                             
   When the crops are ready we share   
 them out and take them home.          
   We put wire around the plot to keep 
 rabbits out, and use netting to keep  
 birds, like pigeons, out.             
   The soil is well drained and dries  
 out quickly in Summer, so we use a    
 hosepipe for watering.                </content>
