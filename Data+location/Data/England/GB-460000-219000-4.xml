		<content>In Ambrosden there are 4 farms:2mixed, 
1 pig &amp; 1 chicken farm.My dad &amp; other  
villagers are very angry with the chick
- en farm because their lorries spill  
some of their contents on the road but 
the County Council won't stop them &amp; it
could cause accidents.                 
  On Cutter Bridge we found a sign.On  
the top round part it said County      
Boundary.On the long bit it said Bucks 
on one side &amp; Oxon on the other.We came
to Furze Grounds Farm.They have 1plough
2 combine harvesters,45 cows,17 sheep,2
working dogs,3 grassfields&amp;6 cornfields
&amp; the farmhouse has 10 rooms.Mr &amp; Mrs  
Berry have farmed there for 7 years.It 
is shown as Folly Farm on the map but  
Mr Berry knocked that down &amp; rebuilt   
Furze Grounds Farm in a slightly       
different area. There are lots of foxes
there which sometimes come right up to 
the farm front door.                   </content>
