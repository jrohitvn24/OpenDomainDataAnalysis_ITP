		<title>20CHANGES IN OUR VILLAGE</title>
		<content>  New people have come to live here    
 because houses have been built but    
 families are smaller.The schools have 
 changed from the old council and      
 church school to the present system.  
{ Shops}are better now but there are   
 less of them.There are not so many    
 jobs availaso people have to travel to
 find work.They go to Hexham,Newcastle 
 and elsewhere sometimes coming home at
 weekends only.                        
  The{facilities}are good for the size 
 of the village.There is now a library,
 a new doctors' surgery and plans for  
 an ambulance station. There are still 
 many activities for people and these  
 are better than before.You can go to  
 night classes,bingo,carpet bowls and  
 whist drives.                         
{ Public transport}needs improving but 
 people find the village is tidier now 
 and a pleasant friendly place to live.</content>
