		<content> There is also alot of wildlife in the 
 area.I went to a pit,which probably   
 used to be a mine,and there I saw lots
 of signs of animals,which include two 
 foxes dens,a badger set,eight rabbit  
 burrows,and several vole holes.I also 
 saw a rabbit.                         
  I visited a pond in a field,around   
 the pond there were a few moorhen     
 nests,In the reeds and rushes.There   
 were some tadpoles swimming in the    
 pond.                                 
            {Employment}               
 There are several small farm owners   
 in the area,but employment on farms   
 is small.People commute to work to    
 Ellesmere,Oswestry,Wrexham and        
 Shrewsbury.Employers in the area are  
 Elson Timber Company ,milking         
 machinery manufacturers Fulwood and   
 Bland, Fabdec and the Dairy Crest     
 dairy, all in Ellesmere.              </content>
