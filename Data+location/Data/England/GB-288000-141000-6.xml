		<content>   Dunkery Beacon is Exmoor's highest  
 point which is 1,705 feet above sea   
 level.Dunkery Beacon has magnificent  
 distant views with a range of up to   
 150 miles from the Malverns to Brown  
 Willy.You can only see it on a day    
 when it is completely clear.Somebody  
 has said that Snowdon can be seen on  
 a very good day.Many people visit the 
 summit to look at the views and often 
 come back again.When they come back   
 the people look at the beautiful      
 scenery around.The cairn on the summit
 is modern and the memorial stone set  
 in its side commemorates the gift of  
 Dunkery to the National Trust by Sir  
 Thomas Acland Bt.Colonel Wiggin and   
 Allan Hugher Esq.The summit mound on  
 which the cairn stands is not known to
 have any significance.
