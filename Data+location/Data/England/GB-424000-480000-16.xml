 protected from winds, with light      
 rainfall,little mist fog or snow and  
 clean air. The land is well husbanded 
 with dry stone walls or hedges between
 fields.Hedges are mainly hawthorn with
 holly,hazel,elder sloe with wild rose 
 and honeysuckle.Trees such as Ash,Oak,
 Wych Elm, Sycamore.There are several  
 wooded areas, including 'the belt',   
 6kms long and some 20ms wide, planted 
 as an estate boundary to Thorp Perrow.
 The wooded side of Holly Hill is a    
 picture in the Spring with a profusion
 of primroses, violets,blue and white  
 anemones, wood sorrel and king-cups by
 the stream.
