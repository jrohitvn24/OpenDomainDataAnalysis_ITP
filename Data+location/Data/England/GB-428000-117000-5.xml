		<title>05 Wellow to a new resident.</title>
		<content>Mr.Lumsdaine and his wife have four    
children.They all attend a local school
in Romsey.Mr.Lumsdaine and his family  
have lived in West Wellow for eight    
years.They came to live in Wellow      
because of its rural situation,but it  
also has good communications,to        
Southampton for his work.The village   
has a great deal of facilities to offer
for all ages.The residents are very    
friendly and helpful.There are only    
four shops in West Wellow but these are
quite sufficient.All the residents     
would like to see an improvement in the
bus service of West Wellow.There are   
only four buses each day,to Romsey,    
Southampton and Salisbury.
