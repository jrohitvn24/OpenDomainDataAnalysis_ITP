		<content>   The lady had lived in the village   
 since 1948. Since then the farm had   
 changed hands and the estate sold to  
 arabs, who now owned all the houses.  
                                       
                                       
   Her husband worked for the estate,  
 while Mr. Wright rented the land. They
 had half an acre of land which was not
 their own. She liked the village,     
 particularly for the quiet.           
                                       
                                       
   None of her ancestors lived here,   
 and there were no clubs or anything.  
 She said it was boring for youngsters.
 There was no policeman, and one needed
 a car to live here. Once upon a time  
 there was a post office.
