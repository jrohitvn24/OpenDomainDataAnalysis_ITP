		<title>12CHICHESTER FESTIVAL THEATRE.</title>
		<content>  From the determination of one man,{  
{Mr. Leslie Evershed-Martin OBE,}has   
 grown the successful &amp; world renowned 
 theatre of today. The idea for{ "The  
{Impossible Theatre"}as it has come to 
 be known, developed after the founder 
 had  seen a  television programme  in 
 1959  about  a  theatre  in{Stratford,
{(Ontario, Canada). }It took  only just
 over  three  years to raise  the funds
 required for  the theatre  to become a
 reality &amp; against all odds the thrust-
 staged  theatre  with an auditorium of
{1,374}seats  opened  for  its  first  
 season on{July 5th 1962.  Sir Laurence
{Olivier }was  its  first  director.   
 During the following years many famous
 actors, actresses and directors  have 
 worked here. 1986 will see its {25th  
{anniversary}&amp; "The Impossible Theatre"
 will have achieved much more than its 
 founder could possibly have foreseen. </content>
