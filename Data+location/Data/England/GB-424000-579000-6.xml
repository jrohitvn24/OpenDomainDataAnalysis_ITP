		<title>06Later, the same Day</title>
		<content> Dad began bleaching the woodwork (he's
 a DIY fanatic,) and I fed Joey. I then
 phoned my mum and brother. She told me
 her nursing homework was hell, and her
 Doberman puppies had destroyed        
 everything in sight.  Henry talked    
 about his computer and his girlfriend 
 Catherine. At 5pm I watched the News, 
 but it was followed by 'Wonder Woman',
 so I tried the other channels.        
 However, nothing appealed to me so I  
 put on 'Wham's Make it Big', &amp; sat    
 back. Dad ruined the atmosphere by    
 using his electric sander, whereupon  
 Joey leapt onto my lap and froze.     
 Later, I replaced the LP and gazed at 
 the piscture of George Michael on the 
 sleeve. I then had coffee, watched TV 
 until ll.30; I enjoyed 'Dynasty' After
 washing and changing, I read a Horror 
 book from my collection. At l2.30 I   
 was asleep.                           </content>
