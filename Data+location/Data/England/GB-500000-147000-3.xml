		<content> The White Lane area is mainly open    
 fields. At White Lane Farm a natural  
 hedge has been formed along the line  
 of a former fence, due to natural     
 dispersal of the seeds by birds. In   
 the wood nearby there are many        
 coniferous trees and a thick          
 undergrowth of ferns.                 
                                       
 In Chilworth there are some footpaths 
 and open fields by a river. There are 
 also many small winding lanes in this 
 area and very little pollution.       
                                       
 The Chantries is a woodland with equal
 amounts of deciduous and coniferous   
 trees. In the thick undergrowth there 
 are many foxes and rabbits. The ground
 is mainly sandy with some clay. The   
 Pilgrims' Way runs along beside this  
 wood and there is a natural spring    
 nearby.                               </content>
