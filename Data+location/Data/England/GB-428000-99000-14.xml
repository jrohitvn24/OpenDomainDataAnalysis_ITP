		<content>   Two users of the village hall are   
 the Play Group and the Womens'        
 Institute. The WI meets monthly       
 usually with a guest speaker and there
 is usually a craft competition with a 
 prize for the best product. Membership
 costs Â£3.50 annually with extra paid  
 for outings. The WI usually produce   
 the annual village play for which the 
 audience pays to watch. The WI is a   
 good thing for the local woman.       
   The play group  is for ages 3 to 5  
 years. It meets five mornings a week  
 from 9.15am to 11.45am; it costs Â£1   
 per child per morning. Four adults    
 look after the children who play      
 games, have stories read to them and  
 drink a glass of milk and eat a       
 biscuit. At Christmas the children act
 a play for their parents to see.
