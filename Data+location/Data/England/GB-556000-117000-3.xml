		<content> A Day in Our Dad's Life               
                                       
 Our Dad works with trees. In the      
 winter he cuts them down to supply    
 people with logs. In the spring he    
 fells chestnut trees which he makes   
 into fencing stakes and rails.Chestnut
 grows quickly and is ready for cutting
 every 15 or 20 years.This is called   
 chestnut coppicing.To make fences he  
 has a special tool called a shaver to 
 remove bark,then the timber is split. 
 This is very difficult.He has a       
 tractor which drives a sawbench to    
 sharpen stakes or cut logs.He makes   
 all sorts of fencing.It is used by    
 farmers for keeping their stock       
 in,gardeners and other fencing        
 contractors in Kent and Sussex.My Dad 
 tells us he is very lucky to be able  
 to earn a living by doing a job he    
 loves. Alan and Neil Crouch.          </content>
