		<title>06ANIMAL FARMING IN SAMPFORD</title>
		<content> Most of the farms are arable.         
 However, a few keep livestock.  This  
 varies with the farmers choice.  In   
 our area we can find pigs are intently
 farmed.  Many pigs are kept together  
 in each house.  The breeding sows have
 their piglets which are kept for 14   
 weeks and fattened for market.        
 Bullocks are male beef cows which are 
 allowed to graze in fields on grass.  
 In Winter they are fed on lessor      
 quality cereal crops.  These are kept 
 for two years and sold for beef.      
 Sheep are left to graze in paddocks   
 with extra food when the grass is     
 poor.  Ewes produce lambs which are   
 fattened and sent to market.  We have 
 many families in our area who own     
 small amounts of land.  These people  
 are called smallholders.  They keep   
 livestock.  This is mostly used to    
 supply food for themselves.           </content>
