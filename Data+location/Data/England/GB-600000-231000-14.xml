{      LANGHAM SEWAGE FARM}            
                                       
 One of the men that works in the      
 sewage farm is called Mr.Rowe. The    
 sewage farm was built in 1960. There  
 are about Five people working there.  
 Langham and Boxted Sewage goes to the 
 Sewage farm. They have a lot of birds 
 like Swifts and Sea gulls about,      
 because they eat the grubs and larvae 
 off of the stones in the sprinkler.   
 The sewage works covers about one     
 acre. It is manned for eight and a    
 half hours each day. The employees    
 do not live locally but travel from   
 surrounding towns and villages. The   
 pumps and the sprinkler are the most  
 important equipment, and are          
 maintained regularly.
