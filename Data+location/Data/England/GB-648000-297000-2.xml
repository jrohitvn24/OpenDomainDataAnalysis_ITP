		<title>02Farming Around Lound</title>
		<content>This has been a farming area since, at 
least, Domesday times. Today farms are 
quite small between 100-450 acres. They
are mixed farms but mainly arable. The 
stock kept are beef and dairy cattle   
but dairying is decreasing. The main   
crops grown are barley,beet and peas.  
Although some farmers own their land   
others are tenants of Lord Somerleyton 
and Waveney District Council. The 1851 
Census Returns show that half the Lound
population worked on farms as farmers, 
labourers,dairy maids and shepherds.   
Now less than 30 people work on farms. 
Farms are run by families with little  
help except at harvest time. The pea   
harvest requires no extra labour as the
buyer,Bird's Eye,Lowestoft,supplies the
viner and transport. Fewer workers are 
needed because farms today are highly  
mechanised and modernised with E.E.C.  
grants.                                </content>
