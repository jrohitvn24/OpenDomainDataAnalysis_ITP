		<content>     In the village of Bradnop their is
a Wesylian Methodist Chapel. This was  
built in 1810. It is made from local   
stone and has four doors and five      
windows. The most interesting feature  
of the chapel is the strange crucifix  
shaped window at the front by the main 
porch.                                 
     The parish of Bradnop used to have
a second chapel. This is no longer used
and the deserted building can be seen  
near Morridge Side on the A523         
Ashbourne Road. This was built in 1889 
but was closed in 1970.
