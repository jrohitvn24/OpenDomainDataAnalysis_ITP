		<content>{A View from both sides of the Water}  
      Although geographically linked on
 the Ordnance Survey map, this area is 
 divided by a stretch of water,        
 Portsmouth Harbour. To the west lies  
 Gosport, the original busy town and   
 some of its suburbs. On the east side 
 is part of the city of Portsmouth and 
 Old Portsmouth itself.                
      The main feature of our area is  
 the Dockyard serving both Naval and   
 commercial needs. There are Naval     
 shore bases here, HMS Dolphin in      
 Gosport and HMS Vernon in Portsmouth. 
 There are regular crossings to France 
 and the Channel Islands by a number of
 ferry services. The Isle of Wight, too
 is only a thirty minute trip away.    
      Gosport and Portsmouth are linked
 by a ferry service taking about four  
 minutes; the journey by road can take 
 about one hour in heavy traffic!      </content>
