		<title>06NTH. KILWORTH NURSING HOME.</title>
		<content>    The Home is housed in a large      
 building which was the old rectory.   
 It became a nursing home under its    
 previouse occupants, Dr. &amp; Mrs Stubbs.
 The present owner, Mrs.Pratt,has      
 extended it by having the stables and 
 outbuldings converted to give more    
 accommodation space.                  
    Between twelve and twenty people   
 are resident at any one time. They are
 mainly very old people. One sees them 
 walking around the village, and some  
 attend school plays.Some of the staff 
 are resident, and some come in daily.
