		<title>11Three Horshoes Inn</title>
		<content> The Inn is at the eastern end of      
 Norton opposite the school. It has    
 been there for 300 years, but the     
 present building for only 100 years.  
 For many years the licencee was a     
 member of a Norton family, the        
 Chamberlains.The last member of the   
 family gave up the tenancy in the     
 early days of the Garden City and     
 passed it to Simpsons the brewers who 
 rented it from Mr Morris Pryor the    
 landowner.An interesting fact is      
 that the Inn contained for many years 
 a Dames School paid for by a certain  
 Mr Edward Wright in 1830.This remained
 open until 1872. The last mistress was
 Elizabeth Chamberlain. The Inn today  
 is in the hands of Charrington        
 brewery and still sells food, drink   
 and offers some accomodation.
