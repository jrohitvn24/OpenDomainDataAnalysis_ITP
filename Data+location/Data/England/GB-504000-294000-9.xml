		<content>There are six farms in our block.Two   
of them belong to Mr.C Fenn.He owns    
Manor Farm and Home Farm. Both are     
medium sized, about 500 acres. Mr.Fenn 
keeps both animals and crops on the    
farms. Mr.Fenn uses a lot of machines  
like tractors,bailers,combines and     
ploughs etc. The water for the animals 
comes from a tap and a well.Four       
people work on the farms to help       
Mr.Fenn with the crops.Mr.Fenns farm   
is 100 years old. Mr Fenns grandfather 
owned the farm before Mr.Fenn. Mr.     
Fenns farm has changed a lot because   
all the machinery has taken over from  
the horses,but nothing else has changed
since. Every field of Mr.Fenns farms   
are in our block.Mr.Fenns fields are   
very big. They have big fields so that 
they can get their big machines in the 
fields.Many farmers in the area have   
removed hedgerows to enlarge fields.   </content>
