		<title>09FARMING IN THE DOBWALLS AREA</title>
		<content> IN THE SQUARES SOUTH OF DOBWALLS,MOST 
 FARMING IS DAIRYING. THE LAND IS WET  
 AND PRODUCES GOOD GRAZING.SOME LAND IS
 USED FOR HAY BUT MOST FOR SILAGE.     
 POTATOES ARE ALSO GROWN AS ARE OTHER  
 VEGETABLES.                           
  THE MILK QUOTA HAS HAD EFFECTS BOTH  
 GOOD AND BAD. FARMERS SAY IT MAKES    
 PLANNING EASIER, BUT THEY ARE LOOKING 
 FOR ALTERNATIVE USES FOR THEIR LAND,  
 WHICH COULD LEAD TO OVER PRODUCTION IN
 OTHER AREAS. ONE FARMER TRIED FORESTRY
 BUT FOUND THE LAND TOO WET.           
   TO THE NORTH OF DOBWALLS THERE ARE  
 MORE SHEEP,FARMERS BEING ASSISTED BY  
 THE E.E.C.SUBSIDY FOR SHEEP LEADING   
 TO FEARS FOR THE MARKETS FOR SHEEP AND
 WOOL.                                 
  IN THE PAST 5 YEARS MORE AND MORE    
 LAND HAS BEEN PLOUGHED.LOCAL FARMERS  
 ARE PROUD OF THEIR LAND AND DEFEND    
 THEIR RECORD ON ECOLOGY FIERCELY.     </content>
