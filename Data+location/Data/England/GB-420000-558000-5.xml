		<content>  A small former mining village. There 
 are lO terraces of brick houses, 8    
 aged miners cottages, some larger     
 detached houses, a church (C of E), a 
 large community centre and a primary  
 school. There are two allotment plots 
 nearby.                               
  Some working, as well as retired     
 miners still live in Marley Hill. In  
 the past men worked at local coke     
 ovens or on the colliery line, now    
 gone. One thing has remained, the     
 Miners Welfare Institute, opened by   
 the Dule of York in l936. It still    
 performs many of its old uses,        
 providing football, bowling, snooker  
 and dances. Badminton and a folk moot 
 are new but cricket has gone. Discos  
 are held for the younger ones. The    
 institute is still the village's      
 meeting place but is now Council      
 owned.                                </content>
