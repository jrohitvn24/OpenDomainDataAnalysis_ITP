		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO AREA</title>
		<content> Our area is situated to the{North of  
{London,}approximately fifteen miles   
 from the centre of London. It is on   
 the edge of the metropolis, and a     
 section of it is within the{Green     
{Belt.                                 
 Over the last ten years the area has  
 been undergoing many major changes.   
 These include large{housing estates   
 being built (part of the{East London  
{re-housing development),}and most     
 recently the building of the{M25.}(The
 London Orbital Motorway). Both of     
 these developments have had a major   
 impact on this area.                  
 The area also includes many green     
 spaces and an abundance of water (a   
 canal and the{River Lea}). Parts of   
 these areas have been developed for   
 recreational purposes.                
 Our area is partially urban and       
 partially rural.                      </content>
