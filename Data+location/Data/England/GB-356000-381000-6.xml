		<content> In 1159 Henry II was proir of Norton, 
 he built the church at Daresbury. The 
 chuch was built of wood and it was    
 filled with plaster so it was known as
 the white church of Cheshire. Charles 
 Dodgson was born on the 27th January  
 1832 at the Old Parsonage in Newton-  
 by-Daresbury. Father Reverand Charles 
 Dodgson was vicar of Daresbury        
 1827-1843. They built a window in     
 memory of Lewis Carroll. It was built 
 and designed by Geoffry Webb and it   
 was dedicated by the Bishop Warrington
 on June 30th 1934. The main subject of
 it is the Adoration of the Babe of    
 Bethlehem. At the bottom of the window
 are characters from his famous        
 stories.The vicar at present is the   
 Rev. Stanley Beckett who comes every  
 Wednesday to read us stories from the 
 bible. We go to church for various    
 festivals.                            </content>
