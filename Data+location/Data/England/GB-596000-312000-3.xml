		<content> Education is compulsory for children  
 from the age of five to 16 and is     
 provided free by the Local Education  
 Authority of the Norfolk County       
 Council. Fee paying Education is also 
 available. Five year old children in  
 Dereham attend one of three First     
 Schools, Dereham Church School (121   
 pupils) Kings Park School (106 pupils)
 and The Grove School (126 pupils).  At
 eight they transfer to Dereham Church 
 Middle School (410 pupils) until 12   
 years old.  Children from Dereham and 
 the surrounding villages will attend  
 one of two High Schools which cater   
 for 12 to 16 year olds. The Neatherd  
 High School has 640 on roll and       
 Northgate High School 780. Some       
 continue their education until 18 at  
 The Sixth Form Centre. Adult Education
 is organised at Northgate School in   
 the evenings.                         </content>
