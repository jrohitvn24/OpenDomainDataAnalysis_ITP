		<title>12Bus services for Coniston</title>
		<content> Most people own, or have access to, a 
{car.}They can easily get to{Ambleside 
 (14km),{Ulverston}(24km) or further   
 afield, even though the cost of{fuel  
 (approximately 42p per litre) makes   
 travelling expensive. But those who   
 rely on{public transport}face greater 
 expense per journey, and also much    
 inconvenience.                        
 The village was served by a{railway   
 (Foxfield - Coniston, via Broughton)  
 until the early 1960's. Since then the
{bus}has been the only public          
 transport.                            
 There is a regular service between    
 Ambleside and Ulverston, but only six 
 buses a day in summer, less in winter.
{Fares}are high, and always there are  
{cut-backs}in the service, partly      
 because fewer and fewer people use the
 buses; a vicious spiral which seems to
 have no end.                          </content>
