		<title>16SOUTH SHIELDS RIVER PILOTS</title>
		<content> The South Shields Pilots' Lookout Post
 overlooks the Harbour of the River    
 Tyne. A 24 hour watch is kept by the  
 pilots waiting to guide ships up the  
 river. Passenger ships from           
 Scandinavia, merchant ships from      
 around the world and naval vessels,   
 all need the services of the pilots.  
 Today's pilots are greatly helped by  
 modern technology both in their work  
 and in their safety. The pilots have  
 coats which can be inflated to make   
 life-jackets should they fall         
 overboard. A torch is built into the  
 coat,and would be triggered off by    
 salt in the water so that the pilot   
 can be seen at night.                 
 The Tyne Pilots have always manned the
 lifeboat when ships have run ashore.  
 They have saved thousands of lives.
