		<content>    There was thunder in the distance  
 but the sound of the meteorite's      
 landing caused great alarm in the     
 area. A local magistrate, Edward      
 Topham, lived nearby and the landing  
 was seen by his shepherd and a        
 farmhand. The meteorite landed within 
 150 yards of the former and the       
 farmhand, John Shipley, was hit by the
 scattered soil and stones.            
    The impact  made a hole 100cm wide 
 and 50cm deep. Mr.Topham had the      
 meteorite removed from the hole,      
 weighed and measured. It originally   
 weighed 56 pounds but pieces were     
 removed for investigation and merely  
 as gifts to friends and authors.      
    The main bulk of the meteorite can 
 be seen in Natural History Museum in  
 London. Mr Topham erected an obelisk  
 on the site of the landing.
