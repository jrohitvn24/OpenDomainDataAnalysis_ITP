		<title>05TRANSPORT IN NEWTOWN AREA</title>
		<content> Most people in this area consider a   
 car is essential and many families    
 have at least two. Very few people    
 ever use the public bus service as it 
 only serves a very small part of it.  
 Four buses run between Portsmouth and 
 Droxford and back daily except Sunday.
 The bus service has decreased in the  
 past 20 years as car ownership has    
 increased. The increased price of     
 petrol lately has made the bicycle    
 more popular. Mopeds are practical    
 especially for 16 year olds, at 17    
 they usually have motorbikes &amp; cars.  
 School buses transport children to    
 their designated schools if they live 
 over 2 miles from Primary and over 3  
 miles from Secondary School. The      
 elderly and infirm find transport a   
 problem but voluntary groups will take
 them to necessary appointments and to 
 luncheon clubs in Wickham and Swanmore</content>
