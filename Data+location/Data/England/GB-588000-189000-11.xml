		<content>    When the whistle goes we go into   
 school and the teacher calls the      
 register. The whole school goes into  
 the hall for assembly. We say prayers,
 sing hymns and get the notices for the
 day. After assembly we go back into   
 our classrooms for our lessons.These  
 consist of maths, language, poetry,   
 handwriting practice, spelling, topic 
 work, P.E., games, drama, country     
 dancing, art, model making, music,    
 quiet reading or personal             
 investigation in the school library.  
    At lunchtime we have a choice of   
 school dinners or sandwiches and then 
 go out to play. During the afternoon  
 session we practised our school play  
 for the end of term.At 3:15 we put our
 chairs up on our tables for the end of
 the school day.
