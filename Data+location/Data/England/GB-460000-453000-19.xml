		<content>{What are the four biggest changes you 
{have seen in the time you have been at
{Rowntrees and could you name two      
{changes you might expect in the next  
{five years?                           
 1. The standard of investment in plant
 and building has improved. The working
 environment has improved,i.e., the two
 fingered Kit Kat plant is tiled out   
 and much cleaner and quieter than the 
 other areas.                          
 2.A move away from a shortage of      
 labour problem to one where we are    
 running down the total number of      
 employees.                            
 3.In the last two years there has been
 a muchgreater acceptance of the need  
 for change.                           
 4.We communicate more to employees    
 about business and the factors that   
 affect jobs,trends and investments.
