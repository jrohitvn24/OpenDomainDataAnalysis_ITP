		<title>18Hobbies and Recreations.</title>
		<content> The young people I spoke to liked to  
 play football or cricket, riding their
 B.M.X. bikes, pony riding and joining 
 Cubs and Brownies. Middle-aged people 
 like playing a game of bowls, watching
 football, doing home improvements,    
 boating, fishing and gardening. Old   
 people enjoy playing cards, reading,  
 gardening, watching television and    
 joining old-people's clubs.           
 My favourite hobby is B.M.X.(Bicycle  
 Motor Cross). It is very hard because 
 you need a decent B.M.X., a helmet,   
 shoulder and knee pads. All that costs
 about Â£170. (D.R.)                    
 I go to 1st Woodbridge Cubs every     
 Friday.It goes on for 2 hours. I pay  
 30p for subs. We do such things as    
 cooking, finding trails and setting-up
 tents. (A.R.)                         
 My pastimes are sewing and knitting. I
 am knitting a sweater for Oxfam.(H.S.)</content>
