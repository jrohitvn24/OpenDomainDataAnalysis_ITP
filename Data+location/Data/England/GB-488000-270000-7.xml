 In the grounds of the derelict Finedon
Hall is a 120year old Copper Beech tree
which stands over 80 feet tall.        
Controversy has flared up about the    
fate of this tree.                     
 A development company that has bought 
the Hall and plans to convert it into  
luxury flats wants to chop down the    
tree.They maintain that it is too close
to the building.A group of concerned   
residents is fighting to prevent the   
tree being removed.                    
 A tree expert has been called in and  
he says that in his opinion the Beech  
is the finest specimen he has seen in  
the country.A petition was organised to
save the tree and it was signed by 44  
of the immediate neighbours.The Council
is still considering this matter.
