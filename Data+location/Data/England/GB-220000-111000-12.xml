		<title>12Beaches in Morwenstow</title>
		<content> Only one beach   in the parish  can be
 reached by car.  It is called{Duckpool
 and is on the border of Morwenstow and
 Kilkhampton parish.   There is sand at
 low tide but sea bathing  is dangerous
 when the tide is going out because  of
 strong currents pulling away from  the
 beach.  The car park  belongs  to  the
 National Trust.  There are   sand bays
 here and at{Stanbury}where sand was   
 stored  to wait  for  the  farmers  to
 collect with their donkey carts.      
{Stanbury Mouth }is reached  by a track
 which follows  a stream nearly all the
 way down  to the  sea.  This beach too
 has  sand at low tide.  {Warren Gutter
 has a  footpath winding  down the high
 and shaley cliffs. It derives its name
 from a rabbit warren kept for shooting
 by the local squires many years ago.  
 The beach is part sand and boulders.
