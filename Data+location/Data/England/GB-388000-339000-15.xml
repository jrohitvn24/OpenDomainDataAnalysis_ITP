		<title>15BLURTON METHODIST CHURCH</title>
		<content>Blurton Methodist Church was opened in 
1964. Mr.Dodd spends only a small      
fraction of his time at Blurton Church 
as Blurton is only one of the four     
churches in his circuit. This circuit  
is called the Stoke South circuit and  
includes Longton, Fenton, Trentham,    
Blurton, Stoke and Blythe Bridge. He   
preaches at Normacot, Blurton, Fulford 
and Trentham. He is helped by 24 local 
preachers and 3 other ministers. There 
are 16 churches altogether in the Stoke
South circuit.                         
This is a diary of a week in his life: 
On Monday morning he went to see the   
relatives of a deceased person and     
finalise the funeral arrangements. Next
he went to arrange a baptism service.  
In the afternoon he went to visit an   
old people's home. On Tuesday morning  
he held a funeral service at Blurton   
church.                                </content>
