		<content>      On Halsanger Common near Rippon  
 Tor the butt of a firing range stands 
 out against the sky. The rifle range  
 was built in 1941 to train soldiers   
 fighting in World War Two. The range  
 has not been used by the army for the 
 past ten years. The National Park     
 Committee objected to its use on the  
 grounds that it was dangerous for the 
 public walking on the moors. Some     
 would like the butt destroyed but the 
 landowner wants it to remain as a     
 piece of wartime archaeology.         
      The butt is made of a brick wall 
 213 ft. long with 17 brick buttresses 
 facing North and two side walls 54 ft.
 long with 6 buttresses infilled  with 
 earth and sand to form a sloping bank 
 facing South. Distance to first target
 bank 89 ft. Distance between mounds   
 250 ft. Length of mounds about 150 ft.
