		<title>13HOLIDAYS FROM A SELBY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Most people like going on{holiday.}A  
 holiday is when a person does not work
 and not do the things he usually does.
 Sometimes it is when a person goes out
 of the country. We did a survey in our
 school. These are the answers we got: 
       CLASS     ABROAD   BRITAIN      
         5         13        21        
         4         10        12        
         3         10         8        
         2          3        23        
         1          7        20        
                                       
 TOTALS            43        84        
                                       
 Class 5 is the oldest children, Class 
 1 the youngest. So it just shows that 
 the most popular place to go is some- 
 where in this country. The people who 
 went abroad went to Greece, Spain,    
 Holland and France.{
