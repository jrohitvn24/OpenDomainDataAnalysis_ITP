		<content>{Plucks Gutter}was a major ferry point 
 after the inning of the marsh had     
 reduced the Wantsum to a river. By    
 1800 the Stour here was only about 100
 feet across, with a pub the{"Dog and  
{Duck"}as the ferry point. This        
 building still stands as a cottage.   
 Oral tradition has it that the{Bridge 
 was built by an inkeeper who saw      
 possibilities for "carriage trade". He
 built a new Dog and Duck in a position
 more suited to the bridge and added   
 extensive stables. This ideal of      
 Edwardian riverside picnics washed    
 down with Kentish Ale, boating,and    
 towpath strolls did not last. Within  
 a few years the{motor car}had made the
 stables redundant. The convenience of 
 the new bridge made for fast through  
 traffic and nobody stopped. It took   
 the caravan boom to regenerate the    
 pub.                                  </content>
