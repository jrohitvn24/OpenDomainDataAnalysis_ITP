		<content>  The first written record of Claygate 
 was just before the Battle of         
 Hastings. t was owned by the Earl of  
 Northumbria.The railway came in 1885  
 when there were 1000 people.There are 
 now some 7000,many of whom regularly  
 commute to London by train.           
  With the arrival of the railway a new
 shopping centre has sprung up in the  
 Parade,which offers many shops from   
 hair-dressers and supermarkets to     
 banks.In the Old Village,the Studio   
 Cake Shop was the post office 120     
 years ago.The three pubs in Claygate  
 are the Winning Horse,the Foley Arms  
 and the Hare and Hounds which is the  
 largest.                              
  The four main carparks are the       
 Station carpark,Fine Fare supermarket,
 the Village Hall and by Champions(DIY 
 suppliers).
