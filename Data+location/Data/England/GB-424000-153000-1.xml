 The area is situated in the south east
 of Wiltshire, and comprises the       
 greater part of the parish of         
 Collingbourne Ducis with the southern 
 part of Collingbourne Kingston. Most  
 of the land lies between 100 and 250  
 metres above sea level.Along the      
 western side of the area is the valley
 of the Bourne, a tributary of the     
 river Avon. To the east of the valley 
 are a number of dry valleys. The      
 highest point is in the area of       
 Gamman's Farm. The eastern boundary is
 marked by a steep drop to Shaw's      
 Bottom. Land use over the area is     
 mainly for agriculture, though the    
 eastern half has an extensive wooded  
 section. Most of the populated area is
 along the Bourne with a few isolated  
 houses in the eastern part.
