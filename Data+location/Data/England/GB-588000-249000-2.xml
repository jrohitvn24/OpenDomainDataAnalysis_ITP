		<content>The building of the church was begun in
the 15th century by John De Vere,13th  
Earl of Oxford,whose star and heraldic 
shields are on the porch.Thomas Spryng 
and other wool merchants gave money to 
help with the building.The tower which 
is 57 metres high was built first and  
stood alone for many years.Its 8 bells 
are famous in the ringing world.The    
church is built in the perpendicular   
style and the original building has not
been altered.The oldest thing inside is
the 14th century font,which is believed
to have stood outside for several years
The window in the tower won a prize at 
the International Exhibition in 1862.  
The chapel is now mostly organ,behind  
it is the American corner.The American 
Airforce donated the old organ pump.   
When Thomas Spryng died,his wife had a 
carved parclose built in his memory.   
The church is a well-known landmark.   </content>
