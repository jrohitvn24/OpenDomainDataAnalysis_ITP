 C.of E.(Aided)Primary School has      
 within its grounds a{Play-group.}This 
 is housed in a purpose built classroom
 on the playground.The group has been  
 in operation for about four years and 
 is very well attended every morning of
 the week.                             
 The children who live out of the      
 village are{transported}to and from   
 the school by coach. The coach firm   
 have been doing this since 1933.

 ities,these include;Cubs and Scouts,
