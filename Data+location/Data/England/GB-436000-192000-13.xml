		<content>In 1581 at the Manor House of the then 
Yate family (now Lyford Grange), Edmund
Campion, a Jesuit priest was captured  
with others, and taken to London where 
he was condemned to death for plotting 
against the Queen.  In 1970 he was     
canonised.                             
It has long been the custom for a      
service to be held at Lyford Grange, to
the memory of St. Edmund Campion and 40
martyrs, and this tradition continues  
with the agreement and co-operation of 
the present owner (Lt.Col. Dingwall).
