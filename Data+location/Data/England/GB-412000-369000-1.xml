		<title>01Taddington Area</title>
		<content>        This area around the village of
 Taddington is part of the higher land 
 in the White Peak.It consists of      
 grassy upland with clumps of trees    
 warning of shafts and spoil heaps from
 the old lead-mining activities.It was 
 one of the smaller liberties in the   
 King's Field.There is visual evidence 
 of early settlement from the Neolothic
 Age due,perhaps,to the springs in the 
 area.The older part of the linear     
 village is sheltered under a north    
 facing hill.It has one of the highest 
 post offices and schools in England.  
 Annual rainfall varies from           
 110-150cm.Despite a local saying      
 of  "nine months winter and three     
 months bad weather" holidaymakers rent
 cottages throughout the year.Farms    
 have reduced in number during the past
 fifty years but all the land is       
 farmed.The population is about 425.   </content>
