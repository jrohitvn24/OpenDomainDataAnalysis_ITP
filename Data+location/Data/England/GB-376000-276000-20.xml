		<title>20Pressures on Wyre Forest</title>
		<content>    The ancient woods West of the river
 are of great interest scientifically  
 and historically, and this, together  
 with the tourism promoted by the town 
 of Bewdley, means that they are       
 subjected to pressures by the public. 
 Conservationists believe that this    
 is not desirable and that even very   
 keen naturalists could be a threat.   
 They are always vigilant and the Wyre 
 Forest Society exists for this reason.
    Picnickers,walkers and horse riders
 expect access, and T.A. exercises, car
 rallies and sponsored walks have been 
 organised. Vandals and poachers have  
 to be dealt with. Conflict naturally  
 exists between commercial,conservation
 and recreational interests, but the   
 Forestry Commission attempts to       
 maintain a good balance.
