		<content>  {The Queen's Lift                    
    The Queen's Lift was made solely   
 for Queen Victoria because she was a  
 liitle too old to use the stairs.  The
 lift was operated by hand until about 
 1890 when it became machine operated. 
                                       
  {The Indian Corridor                 
    The Indian Corridor is full of     
 Indian statues, pictures, vases and   
 ornaments.  It has lots of gifts and  
 presents which were given to the Queen
 by rich Rajah's of India, because     
 Queen Victoria was not only Queen of  
 England but also Emporess of India.   
                                       
    Queen Victoria died in 1901 after  
 being Queen for 56 years.
