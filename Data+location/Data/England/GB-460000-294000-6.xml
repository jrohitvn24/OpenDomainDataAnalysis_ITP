		<content> The grid is primarily agricultural in 
 nature. Since the rapid spread of     
 Enclosure in the late 18th and early  
 19th Centuries Leicestershire has been
 associated with stockbreading. This   
 area of South Leicestershire is really
 no exception,the vast majority of land
 is given over to pasture or the       
 production of hay or silage for winter
 feed. There is a limited production of
 grain but this is insignificant in    
 comparison. The animals kept within   
 this grid are mainly cattle and sheep.
 The cattle are kept both for dairy and
 meat production. There is a small area
 given to Markat Gardening but this is 
 mainly for the farms themselves. Some 
 land is also set aside for keeping    
 horses the riding of which is a       
 popular pastime in this area.
