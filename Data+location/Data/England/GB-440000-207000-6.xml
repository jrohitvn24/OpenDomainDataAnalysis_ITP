		<title>06 POLICE IN EYNSHAM</title>
		<content>The local Eynsham policeman is called  
COLIN RICHARDS.He has been the Eynsham 
policeman for 6 years.If you are a man 
and you want to be a policeman you have
to be 5,9 ft,but if you are a women    
then you have to be 5,4 ft.They have   
not been many breakins or things like  
that for the past two months.          
Bartholomew school has been broken into
3 times this year,and a couple of other
 schools have also been broken into.   
you have 5 cse's to be a police man or 
woman.So altogether there aren't many  
crimes in the village of Eynsham.
