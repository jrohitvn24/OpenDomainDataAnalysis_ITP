		<title>09 THE STORMBRINGERS</title>
		<content>It all started with an advertisement   
written by Norman Bristowe in the      
Evening Telegraph sometime in August of
l983. A meeting was arranged for anyone
interested in American Football. Over  
thirty people turned up and practice   
sessions were organised every Sunday   
afternoon at North Park, Kettering.    
The Club was soon christened           
"Stormbringers" after the dragster     
which beat the quarter mile record at  
Santa Pod.                             
The Stormbringers were filmed on Anglia
television which helped publicity and  
attracted people to the meetings.      
Soon after their initial success they  
moved to Northampton training first on 
the racecourse and later transferring  
to Obelisk Sports Ground. A solid      
silver helmet worth several hundred    
pounds is awarded to the best player at
the end of the season.                 </content>
