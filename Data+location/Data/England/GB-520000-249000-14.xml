		<content>{St.Sylvester's  Church}was preceded   
 by a temporary building which was     
 opened on{December 31st. 1879, St.    
{Sylvester's Day,}and was named St.    
 Sylvester's. The{present building}was 
 opened and dedicated on{July          
{28th. 1885 }by the Bishop of Ely.     
 According to records held, the Rev    
 John Watkins did tremendous good work 
 for the church. It is due to his      
 efforts that the church was built at a
 cost of Â£800. It was used as an{Army  
{Chapel}during the period 1941_1945.   
 St Sylvester's is a{very small        
{church}with room for a congregation   
 of approximately eighty four people.  
 It is built in a{similar style to     
{Keeble College Oxford}with a          
 combination of light brick and dark   
 brick{.Three services a month}are held
 there. It will be the{centenary}of the
 church's opening in July 1985.        </content>
