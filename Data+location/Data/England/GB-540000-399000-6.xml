		<content> THE FARMLAND IN THIS BLOCK IS ALL     
 PERFECTLY FLAT. IT WAS RECLAIMED FROM 
 SALTMARSH IN THREE PHASES. THE FIRST  
 WAS IN THE 163OS AND THE OTHER TWO IN 
 THE 19THC.THE SEA BANK CONSISTS OF    
 MAINTAINED SAND DUNES. OUTSIDE THE    
 BANK IS SALTMARSH WHICH IS ACCRETING  
 AND BEYOND THAT MUDFLATS BEING        
 COLONISED BY SAMPHIRE WHICH IS PICKED 
 AND EATEN PICKLED BY LOCAL PEOPLE BUT 
 ALONG WITH MOST OTHER TRADITIONAL     
 PRACTICES THIS IS DYING OUT. OUTSIDE  
 THIS ARE VAST AREAS OF SAND FORMED    
 INTO RIDGES BY THE SEA. BECAUSE THE   
 BEACH IS GENTLY SLOPING THE EXACT     
 POINT OF HIGH TIDE VARIES A LOT.
