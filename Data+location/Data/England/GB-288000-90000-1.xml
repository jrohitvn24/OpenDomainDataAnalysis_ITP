		<content> The area stretches from the river Exe,
 through the residential area around   
 Cowick Street, westwards to the       
 village of Ide. In the south of the   
 area is the trading estate and north  
 wards, beyond the large housing       
 estates is mainly countryside.        
 Building development, over the years, 
 has gradually encroached on the farm  
 land. Many local people find their    
 employment and recreation in the area.
 There are medical centres, parks,     
 pubs, nightclubs, social clubs, and   
 many  sport and leisure amenities.    
 There are many shops, so there is     
 really no need to cross the river into
 Exeter.  Next year will see a leisure 
 centre in the area and this will bring
 many visitors.  The main roads and    
 railways carry much of the traffic to 
 south and west Devon and also the     
 Cornish traffic.                      </content>
