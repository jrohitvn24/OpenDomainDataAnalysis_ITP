		<content>{Landscape of the area.}This area      
 lies to the south of the Victorian    
 town of {Clevedon }and includes the   
 village of{Kenn. }The land within the 
 boundaries of{Clevedon}has been newly 
 developed since the coming of the{M5.}
 There are many new estates lying on   
 each side of a ring road.There are    
 two blocks of industrial units and a  
 large engineering factory.            
 There are three rivers flowing through
 the area,the Land Yeo,the Middle Yeo  
 and the Blind Yeo and it is from these
 that the area gets its name"{Yeo-Moor}
 ".Between the town and the village of 
 Kenn lies flat farming land.This land 
 was once under water and is still very
 marshy and divided by man-made drains 
 called{Rhynes.}These are a natural    
 habitat of much wild life,particularly
 herons.
