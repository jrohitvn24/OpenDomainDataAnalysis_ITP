Charltons and Margrove Park both have community centres, but their use is rather different to that described for 1986.  At Charltons the hall is hired out to external organisations, but there is some participation by residents.  There are yoga classes and dance classes (Zumba for adults and a class for young girls). A drumming group meets on a regular basis.  The Management Committee organize social events, mainly for children, such as at Christmas, Valentines Day and Halloween.  Films for children have been shown in the last year, under a scheme to encourage film shows in rural areas.  In 2011 there were two major events that were well supported by Charltons residents.  These marked the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton in April and the opening of the Charltons Play Park in August.  &lt;br />&lt;br />In June the residents of Margrove Park organised their 2nd  Annual Fun Day, mainly for children. &lt;br />&lt;br />Stanghow Community Centre is used for bingo and afternoon sewing sessions.&lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
