		<title>14LEOMINSTER RAILWAY STATION</title>
		<content> The station stands a little way out   
 of the town centre on the Worcester   
 Road. During the past three years it  
 has been the focus of a big clean-up  
 operation after an appeal and petition
 by the people of Leominster. It is now
 clean and tidy and part occupied by   
 local craftsmen.                      
 The station is unmanned and passengers
 usually pay on the train. Trains from 
 Leominster run direct to Cardiff via  
 Hereford and Newport and to Crewe via 
 Ludlow and Shrewsbury. Connections can
 be made all over England, Wales and   
 Scotland. The train is also much used 
 locally by shoppers and school        
 children on the fast regular service  
 to Hereford. On occasions we are      
 reminded of a bygone age when one of  
 Bulmer's steam engines roars through  
 our station watched by many           
 enthusiasts.                          </content>
