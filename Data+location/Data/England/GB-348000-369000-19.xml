		<title>19Playtime in 1985</title>
		<content> At 10:30 it is playtime.Some people   
 rush out to make the most of their    
 playtime; others like to stay in to   
 read Beano and other comics.The older 
 boys usually play football but some of
 the third year boys build dens in the 
 woodland area.The girls play tick or  
 elastics or a skipping game such as   
 -"Raspberry apple jam tart-tell me the
 name of your sweet heart-A.B.C.D...." 
 When it is a wet playtime we have to  
 stay in and read or draw.In summer we 
 all have to go out unless you have    
 hayfever.In winter when there's snow  
 on the ground,we all have fun throwing
 snowballs,making snowmen and making   
 skiddy patches.When playtime ends our 
 teacher blows a whistle.We all stand  
 still and then we are sent in class by
 class.We have to walk in quietly and  
 then we get on with our work.
