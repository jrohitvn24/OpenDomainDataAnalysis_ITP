		<title>20TYPICAL DAY NICOLA TOLLIDAY</title>
		<content>6.30 &amp; I'm trying to rouse myself.The  
paper round has to be finished by 7.30 
as we have to have breakfast before    
school.Normally I have something like  
sausages or bacon &amp; toast.After break- 
fast it's oboe or piano practice.At 8  
Jo,my sister leaves for school and then
Mum,Midge,our spaniel,&amp; I leave.We're  
lucky because we don't have a set time 
table.We have a list of things  that   
have to be finished.Some terms we go   
swimming at Amersham.At noon the bell  
rings and if it is fine we are allowed 
to eat outside as a Class 8 privilege  
in return for doing duties.School ends 
at 3.30 and we have after school acti- 
vities :Chess,Computers,Music,Games,   
Athletics,Gardening.On Saturdays I go  
to Music Centre then riding.My hobby,  
apart from riding is swimming and I be-
long to the local club,Chalfont Otters 
and train with them 4 times a week.    </content>
