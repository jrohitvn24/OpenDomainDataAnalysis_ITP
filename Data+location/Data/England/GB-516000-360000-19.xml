		<content>{ATTITUDES IN WOODHALL SPA}            
{Housing}Many people now live in either
 council house accomodation,rented     
 property or their own homes.Because   
 services are concentrated in one place
 many isolated tied cottages are now   
 falling into disrepair as they are no 
 longer required because farmers are   
 much more mechanised than ever before 
 and therefore require fewer men to    
 manage greater numbers of acres.{     
{Religion}Many church going people     
 think we are at the turning point     
 after a decline of 40yrs and after    
 reaching a low ebb through the        
 permissive years of the 60s &amp; 70s.Many
 are questioning the results of this   
 permissiveness and are seeking        
 something more substantial &amp; abiding.{
{Government}At a local level there is  
 much apathy &amp; elections occur seldom. 
 Turnout for elections is poor.        </content>
