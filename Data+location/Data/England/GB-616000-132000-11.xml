      The church was so crowded that   
 the soldiers from the Royal Staff     
 Corps that was set up in Hythe a while
 after the Military Canal was built and
 the people from the{School of Musketry
 were forbidden to go to church. But   
{Lord Palmerston}wrote to the rector so
 the soldiers were to sit on forms and 
 more seats were also provided. To the 
 side of St Leonards church is the     
 thirteenth  century crypt.
