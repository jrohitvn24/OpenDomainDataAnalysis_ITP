		<title>02CUSTOMS IN BIRCH PART ONE</title>
		<content>  Many of the{village customs}revolve  
 around the church and school. These   
 customs are also linked with the      
 villages of Birch,Layer Breton and    
 sometimes Layer Marney, the three     
 parishes looked after by the same     
 vicar. Farming is closely linked with 
 these customs.                        
{ JANUARY}- On Plough Sunday there is  
 the custom of blessing the work of the
 farmers at the beginning of the year. 
{ FEBRUARY}- Early in the month we     
 celebrate Education Sunday with       
 exhibitions of the childrens work and 
 parents and staff invited to a        
 service.                              
{ APRIL}- A Palm Sunday procession     
 leaves Layer Breton Church led by a   
 boy dressed as Jesus and riding a     
 donkey. All local organisations are   
 involved with a sevice in Birch church
 completing the event.                 </content>
