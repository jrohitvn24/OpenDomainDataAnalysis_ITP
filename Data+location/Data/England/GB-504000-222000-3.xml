		<title>03LIMBURY AND THE MOAT HOUSE</title>
		<content>  Limbury is primarily residential,most
 houses being built between 1959 and   
 1975.34% of land cover is open space  
 and a lot of this is{River Side       
 walk,which has been extended to create
 a pleasant walk along the{River Lea}  
 which flows from West to South-East   
 before turning South to London.The one
 building of real historical interest  
 is the Moat House,which was built     
 between 1370 and 1400 as a{Norman}    
{Manor House.}The{Timber}roofing has   
 been preserved,despite a fire in      
 1967,and there is an inscription dated
 1666 describing hailstones the size of
 golfballs.Now used as a{Restaurant,}  
 the building is still surrounded by a{
{moat},hence the name.On the north side
 of the River Lea close to the Moat    
 House is one of Luton's largest areas 
 of public allotments,and tenancy of   
 these gardens is jealously guarded.   </content>
