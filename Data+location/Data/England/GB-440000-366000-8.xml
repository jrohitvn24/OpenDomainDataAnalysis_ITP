		<title>08POULTRY AT TEMPLE NORMANTON</title>
		<content> In Temple Normanton is an old family  
 poultry farm owned by the Wright      
 brothers. Farms like it are unusual   
 because the fowls are kept mainly for 
 breeding purposes. Chickens from the  
 farm are supplied to various parts of 
 the country.                          
 The eggs are placed in an incubator   
 for 21 days and are turned regularly. 
 Once hatched the chicks are sexed and 
 most of the males destroyed. The      
 pullets are kept in a warm shed for a 
 further two months before being let   
 out into the free range pens. There   
 are no batteries on this farm.        
 There are about 2000 adult birds and  
 400 chickens at any one time. About   
 250 eggs are collected each evening   
 and suitable ones used for further    
 breeding. The most common breeds are  
 Rhode Island Reds and Leghorns.
