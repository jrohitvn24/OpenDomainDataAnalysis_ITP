		<content> On Fridays in the holidays,I go shop- 
 ing with my mum and two sisters.We    
 walk to Oakengates and meet my Nan in 
 the market.There are lots of stalls   
 selling jewellery,second-hand goods,  
 clothes and wool as well as fish,meat 
 and vegetables. Next we go to Saverite
 Supermarket where mum buys cereals,   
 bread, butter, cheese, tinned food and
 cleaning materials.We spend about Â£15.
 Sometimes we go to the Post Office and
 my Nan buys stamps or pays a bill.We  
 go on to the greengocers and Nan buys 
 her fruit and vegetables.When we have 
 done the shopping we walk across the  
 park to my Nan's house. There we have 
 a salad roll and a drink of Cola.Nan  
 has a cup of tea. Afterwards we play  
 in the park until it's time to go     
 home.We go by taxi as the shopping is 
 heavy.Dad comes in at 5 o'clock and we
 have liver,potatoes and beans for tea.</content>
