		<content> There is a Quoits team in Thornton    
 Watlass and one in Thirn.The game is  
 played behind the Buck Inn in Watlass 
 and the Boot and Shoe in Thirn.Each   
 village has two teams,team A and team 
 B, which play in the Lower Dales      
 League.                               
                                       
 To keep the pitch moist they          
 put oil in with the clay which is     
 bought from Littlethorpe Pottery.Each 
 player has two malleable steel quoits 
 which are thrown over a cast iron pin 
 in the clay.This is called a ringer.If
 your opponent is the last to throw on 
 the peg he gets the point.            
                                       
 Shooting is a popular sport in the    
 area. Local Gun Clubs arrange regular 
 shoots about the farms. Pheasant, hare
 and rabbit are among the game taken,  
 according to season.                  </content>
