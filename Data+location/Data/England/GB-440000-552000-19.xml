 churches in the Ryhope area. Those    
 who worship in other denominations    
 have to travel into Sunderland to     
 practise their faith.                 
    The original church, ministering to
 the needs of the Church of England    
 community, was built in 1826. Later it
 was converted into a school. It is    
 now used as a rent office as there is 
 a purpose-built school opposite the   
 present church. This is the Parish    
 church of{St. Paul's}which was built  
 in 1870.The vicar is the Rev.Fletcher.
    St.Paul's is the mother church of  
{St.Aidan's,}Grangetown which began as 
 a mission church in 1883 until the    
 present church was built in 1911.
