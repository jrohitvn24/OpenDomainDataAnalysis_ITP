		<title>12HOUSING IN HARDWICK</title>
		<content>  The houses in the area reflected the 
 care and hard work of the residents.  
 They were{modernised, well-maintained 
 and a pleasure to look at. Many of the
 houses are farm houses-{stone built,  
{large, detached}and fairly{old.       
 However, alongside these are          
 relatively new{bungalows}and{houses-  
 modern yet blending in with the       
 surrounding buildings. There are also 
 some{terraced cottages}close to       
 Hardwick Hall.                        
  Many of the houses in the area belong
 to the{National Trust,}which owns a   
 large proportion of the land. The     
 houses owned by them are rented out to
 the occupants.                        
  There is also a{council housing      
 estate in Glapwell- houses owned and  
 maintained by the local authority.
