 ratepayers of this area is the cost of
 defences against the sea. The damage  
 caused by storms in 1978 and in 1953  
 indicated just how vulnerable the area
 could be when strong wind and high    
 tide combined to batter the coastline.
 The shore on either side of the pier  
 has long been protected by a sea wall 
 but until recent years the coast in   
 the extreme west of this block was    
 unprotected and the cliffs below      
 Beltinge were badly eroded. However by
 1985 the entire coast of this block   
 has been protected by a sea wall. Also
 the beaches are all protected by      
 wooden breakwaters. The central area  
 between the pier and the clock tower
