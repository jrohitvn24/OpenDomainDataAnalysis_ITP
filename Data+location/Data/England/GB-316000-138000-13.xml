		<title>13Nether Stowey: Traditions</title>
		<content> Each year on the nearest Saturday to  
 Midsummer's Day,the women and girls of
 Nether Stowey process through the     
 village, carrying flower posies. A    
 standard bearer, carrying the flag of 
 the Nether Stowey Female Friendly     
 Society, founded in 1859, leads the   
 walkers. Music is provided by the     
 Watchet Town Band. The Society was one
 of the first in the country, raising  
 money by subscription and contribution
 to provide a decent burial for members
 and medical care for the sick. In 1974
 its name was changed to The Women's   
 Walk. Its only function now is this   
 traditional procession, finishing with
 a church service.                     
 The Village Carnival, traditionally   
 held in the Autumn but discontinued,  
 was revived with the Queen's Jubilee  
 Celebrations.Now held in May, it is a 
 popular event and attracts tourists.  </content>
