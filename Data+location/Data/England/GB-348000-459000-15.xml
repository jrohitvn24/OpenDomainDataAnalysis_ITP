On Friday, 21st June, six of us went   
to visit Little Fell Farm, Quernmore.  
The farmer's name is Robert Whittaker  
and he farms 120 acres. He owns 80     
acres and rents 40. The farm is a      
family concern. There are 18 fields,9  
are meadows, the other nine are        
managed grass. It is a mixed farm,     
with mainly dairy and some beef        
cattle. There are 8 bulls which are    
kept in a barn.                        
 The milking parlour smelled. Eight    
cows are milked at once. They give     
190000 litres a year.                  
 On the farm there are 3 tractors,     
a mower, a rowing up machine which     
puts the cut grass into straight rows, 
a bailer and a spreader. The farmer    
also sells woodburning stoves.
