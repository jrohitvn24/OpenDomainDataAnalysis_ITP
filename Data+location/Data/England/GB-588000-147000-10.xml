		<title>10Housing in Egerton</title>
		<content>   The area is rural with a mixture of 
 housing dating from the C15 to the    
 1980s.  Most of the older properties  
 are farms or former farms away from   
 the village. There are however some   
 good examples remaining within Egerton
 village centre. Most are well main_   
 tained and there are some good ex_    
 amples of renovation and adaptation to
 modern use without losing the charact_
 er.  Most houses are owner occupied   
 although there are a few Borough      
 Council owned houses and a small      
 housing association complex which are 
 tenanted.  There are also a few tied  
 homes.  Most houses built prior to    
 1939 have large gardens.  All propert_
 ies are connected to mains water and  
 electricity.  Within the village area 
 sewage is disposed of via a main      
 system. Other properties rely on cess_
 pools or septic tanks. No gas mains.  </content>
