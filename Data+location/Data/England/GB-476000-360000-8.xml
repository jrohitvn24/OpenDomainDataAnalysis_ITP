		<content>   Through this quiet rural area runs  
 the busy{railway line}from{Scotland to
{London, King's Cross.}The line has a  
 great effect on people's lives in the 
 area as the main road to Newark from  
 Norwell crosses the line at{Cromwell  
 and regular travellers along the road 
 are frequently held up at the         
 crossing. As trains can travel over   
 this crossing at speeds of over{100   
{m.p.h.}the delay on the barriers has  
 to be sufficient to ensure adequate   
 safety.                               
   We decided to do a survey at the    
 crossing to see just how long the     
 barriers stayed down. On Wednesday    
 October 23rd between 1330 and 1430, 5 
 trains passed the crossing, all{Inter 
{City 125's.}We timed the barriers.....
   Barriers up, road open...44.17 mins.
   Barriers down............15.43 mins.
 The road was closed{25%}of the time.  </content>
