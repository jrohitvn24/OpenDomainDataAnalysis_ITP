		<title>03A boy at Tilshead School</title>
		<content> When I wake up in the morning I go to 
 the loo. Then I go into the bathroom. 
 I have a bath and then get dressed. I 
 have my breakfast and I get ready for 
 school. When I am ready for school I  
 wait for the mini-bus. Then the       
 mini-bus comes to take me to school.  
 When we get to school we put our      
 things inside and go out to play. Then
 the bell rings and we go into school  
 and sit down for assembly. Someone    
 puts on some music. We listen and Mr  
 Jones says prayers and reads us a     
 story. Then we do some work. Then it  
 is playtime. Then we do some more work
 and have SQUIRT which means Super     
 Quiet Un-Interrupted Reading Time.    
 After dinner it is playtime and we do 
 some more work. We have another       
 playtime before the story. Then we go 
 home. When I get home I watch T.V. We 
 have a colour T.V. and a video.       </content>
