		<content>    Mum now leaves the rather quiet    
 house to my Nan.She departs for work  
 at about 9.30,and cycles.Her works are
 less than a mile away,in Byfleet      
 village,so it doesn't take long.      
    My dad drives for about 20 minutes 
 to his work,before reaching           
 Guilford,and arriving at 8.30a.m he   
 remains there till 5.00p.m.,when he   
 drives home.                          
    My school day finshes at 3.15,and  
 I either catch the bus home at 4.00   
 or I walk.This gets me home at the    
 same time.                            
    Mum only works part-time.She       
 finishes at 1.00,and shops on her way 
 home,so normally,comes home to see Nan
 about 1.30 p.m.                       
    When I come in from school,first,I 
 do my homework,then go out and play   
 with my friends.                      
    Dad normally comes in about 5.30   </content>
