		<title>07Polhill Riding Centre</title>
		<content>   A group of us went to{Polhill Riding
{Centre.}The{owner is blind}but she is 
 able to run the centre. She set it up 
 because she likes horses and wants    
{handicapped people}to be able to ride.
   The centre is for the{mentally and  
{physically handicapped.}Some people   
 who are not handicapped come and ride 
 because it is more fun for the        
 horses.There are{eight horses}and     
 pupils are taught in a ring with the  
 instructress in the middle. The owner 
 takes pupils out on hacks helped by   
 sighted riders.                       
   The owner hopes to have a ramp so   
 that people in wheelchairs can mount  
 easily. She also wants handrails      
 leading to the paddock and fields.    
   At the Centre Summer Show a girl    
 without arms put the saddle on her    
 pony and walked, trotted, cantered and
 jumped.                               </content>
