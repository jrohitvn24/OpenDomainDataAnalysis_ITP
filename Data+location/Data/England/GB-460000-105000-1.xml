		<title>01THE PEOPLE OF PORTCHESTER</title>
		<content> The main part of this area concerns an
 attitudes survey conducted amongst    
 various people living in Portchester. 
 The questions we asked were:          
 1)  Their name, age, occupation and   
     social situation                  
 2)  How long they have lived in       
     Portchester                       
 3)  What were their main problems in  
     life                              
 4)  What are the main national        
     problems and how would they solve 
     them                              
 5)  What are the main local issues    
 6)  What do they hope for in the      
     future                            
 7)  What has this country most lost   
     during their lifetime.            
 The rest of this section is a general 
 study on life in Portchester at the   
 present.
