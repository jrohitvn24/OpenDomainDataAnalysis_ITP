      For the older citizens there is a
 branch of the British Legion with 200 
 members and an active W.I. There is a 
 Mens Club in Fingringhoe which is open
 to women at Sunday lunch time but the 
 ladies enjoy their W.I                
      The Nottage Instute on the       
 Wivenhoe water front was set up by    
 Capt.Charles Nottage in the 1870s so  
 that"young seamen could advance       
 themselves in their calling". It is   
 still used for evening classes in     
 navigation, seaman ship and boat      
 building without power tools.
