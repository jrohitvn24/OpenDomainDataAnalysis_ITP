		<content> Two farmers' wives still run turkeys  
 for the Christmas trade, buying in    
 300 young turkeys in August for       
 fattening. This practice is not as    
 common as it was, because the new     
 generation does not wish to be        
 involved in so much work.             
 There is a very large pig farm in     
 High Offley . It has two acres of pig 
 units containing 4000 pigs which are  
 Large White X Landrace. Breeding sows 
 are kept for three or four years      
 before being sent to be made into pork
 pies. The young pigs are sent for     
 slaughter at about 20 weeks. This farm
 also produces sugar beet as a cash    
 crop.                                 
 There is one market garden of 4 acres 
 with one third of an acre under glass 
 producing tomatoes. Lettuce, salad    
 onons and rhubarb are also grown.
