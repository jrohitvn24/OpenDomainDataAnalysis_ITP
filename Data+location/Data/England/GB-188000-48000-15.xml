		<content> Ladock Juniors and their families get 
 up at various times between 5.30 and  
 11.00a.m.The earliest riser helps her 
 herdsman father with the milking.     
 Breakfast consists of cereals and in 1
 case of croissants, no-one mentions   
 having bacon and egg,which was the    
 usual breakfast fare. 5 children      
 attend chapel, 6 go to Church and one 
 boy to the Roman Catholic Church in   
 Truro.Lunch is mainly a roast meal.1  
 girl has sandwiches and 1 boy has     
 a cafe lunch. The most dominant       
 activities on Sundays are watching    
 T.V.,feeding and exercising horses and
 dogs.A fair amount of shopping is     
 done,some people going as far as Par  
 market. The most popular T.V.         
 programmes are Esther Rantzen's "Thats
 Life","Winner Takes All",films and    
 "Spitting Image".Bedtime is anytime   
 from 8.00 until 11.00p.m.             </content>
