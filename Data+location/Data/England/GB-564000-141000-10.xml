		<title>10Brenchley School Musical.</title>
		<content>   Every year Brenchley &amp; Matfield     
 C.E.P. School puts on a musical.The   
{fourth year}take the main parts,with  
 chorus help from the third year and   
 additional singing from the lower     
 school choir.These musicals have      
 become almost a{tradition.            
{ }This year the musical is{"Annie Get 
{Your Gun"}it was shown in the West End
 about ten years ago. Before starting  
 rehearsals our director had to decide 
 who was playing what parts and who was
 needed to help with costumes,scenery, 
 props and makeup.                     
   Helped in the production by our     
{musical director,}our{director}has    
 very often threatened us and nagged   
 us,but if she hadn't the musical would
 have been a flop.The rehearsals have  
 mainly been after school and often    
 spoiled plans for going out,but I must
 say it has all been worthwhile.       </content>
