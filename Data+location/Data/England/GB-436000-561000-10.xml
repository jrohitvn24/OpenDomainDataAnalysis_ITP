		<title>10A DAY IN THE LIFE OF JULIE</title>
		<content> I am 11 years old.I live with my      
 sister who is 10 and my step brother  
 who is older than me,because my Mam   
 has just remarried.I have never had a 
 brother before and I have lived with  
 my grandparents for a long time.My Mam
 has been trying to get us a Council   
 house so we can all live together     
 again.                                
 We used to live in Hebburn with my    
 real Dad but he left us when my       
 sister was a tiny baby.               
 My Mam and new Dad are retraining for 
 a different job as manager and        
 manageress of a pub for Vaux. I'll be 
 glad when she starts her new job      
 properly, because I don't see her very
 much at the moment as she travels to a
 different place of work each week.    
 I'm going to the Comprehensive School 
 next year.I hope that we are all      
 living together by then.              </content>
