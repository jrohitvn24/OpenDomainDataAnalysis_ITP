		<title>10THE BLUE BELL HOTEL</title>
		<content> The Blue Bell Hotel is 33 years old   
 but the building dates back to l690   
 when it was the vicarage and you can  
 still see a doorway in a part of the  
 dining room where the vicar used to   
 get out of the house and go to church.
 After it had been the vicarage it was 
 called the Heversham Hotel.  A new    
 bypass was built in l937 which allowed
 more people to come to the Blue Bell. 
 There is a hole beneath the bar floor 
 which dates back to the day's of      
 Oliver Crommwell where church silver  
 valuables were kept from the King's   
 men.  The hole cost 5p. or a shilling 
 in those days to dig.  After it was   
 called the Bell until it was painted  
 blue and from then on it was called   
 Blue Bell.  Today it is quite modern  
 and you can still see a couple of     
 faint words from Heversham Hotel which
 haven't been rubbed off by the paint. </content>
