		<content>  The village of Middleton Cheney is in
a limited development area,which means 
that only 100 new houses can be built  
between now and the year 2000.         
  However,the area is hoping to expand 
when the proposed extension to the M40 
motorway comes to Banbury in the next  
few years.Therefore there is likely to 
be some conflict of interests.It is    
expected that the amount of new house  
development,and land prices will       
increase.This will put pressure on farm
land and it is thought that much       
speculative buying could be taking     
place.                                 
  The proposed M40 should bring more   
prosperity to the area,changing its    
character from rural to dormitory.     
  A further development is the long    
awaited Middleton bypass.Community     
life is bound to change.....
