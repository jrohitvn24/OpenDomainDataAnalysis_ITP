		<content>   {BUILDWAS ABBEY,a Cistercian house, 
 was built by Roger De Clinton in 1135.
 The monks were a farming community.   
 Since 1925 the Department of the      
 Environment has cared for the ruins.  
     In 1708{Abraham Darby 1}came to   
 Coalbrookdale. In 1709, he first      
 smelted iron, using coke not charcoal,
 because the wood was needed for ships,
 buildings and houses. Shropshire coal 
 was good for coke because it didn't   
 contain sulphur.                      
     At first, Coalbrookdale iron was  
 only suitable for casting because it  
 contained too much phosphorus for     
 wrought iron, but by{1750, Abraham    
{Darby 2}had solved the problem. He    
 increased production in the furnaces  
 by using a Newcomen engine to pump    
 water to 10 waterwheels.              
     In 1775{Abraham Darby 3}was in a  
 group planning a Severn bridge.       </content>
