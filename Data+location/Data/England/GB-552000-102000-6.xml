		<title>06Badger Protest at Folkington</title>
		<content> The badger protest is an organisation 
 run by the Brighton Animal Right      
 campaigners and the Folkington Badger 
 Action group. They are protesting     
 about the tests done on badgers. These
 tests are to see if they are the cause
 of Bovine Tuberculosis,which has      
 already caused eight cattle to be     
 slaughtered in the area. The tests    
 include skin, blood and urine tests   
 and are carried out at Weybridge in   
 Surrey.If the tests are positive the  
 badgers are to be gassed.             
                                       
 The Ministry of Agriculture have laid 
 about ninety traps,all of them have   
 mysteriously disappeared. The Badger  
 Protesters camp has been in Folkington
 woods since June 1984 but the cold    
 winter together with the lack of      
 supporters and funds have forced the  
 campaigners to leave in Summer 1985.  </content>
