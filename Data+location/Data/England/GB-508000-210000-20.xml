		<title>20ST.MARY'S CHURCH CONTINUED</title>
		<content> In the{NORTH AISLE}there are three    
 semi_circular arches which are Norman 
 in origin.There are also the remains  
 of a small Norman window and a blocked
 doorway.                              
  The{ROOD SCREEN}is one of the most   
 beautiful things in the church.This   
 was constructed in the 15th century.  
  During the{Wars of the Roses}the     
 Church was used as a stable and was   
 damaged during the battles of         
 St.Albans.                            
  There are several other parts of the 
 Church which are interesting but too  
 numerous to mention.                  
   This information was compiled and   
 written by the children of classes 4L 
 and 4H Redbourn Junior School Summer  
 1985.
