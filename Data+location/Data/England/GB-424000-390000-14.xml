		<title>14SCHOOL LIFE IN THE THIRTIES</title>
		<content> I remember long walks to school,big   
 fires &amp; huge fireguards,paraffin lamps
 outdoor middens,smells of smoke &amp;     
 disinfectant,standing around in a vest
 waiting for the doctor,sitting in the 
 dentists chair,rows of desks with lift
 _up seats &amp; tops,country_dancing to   
 piano music,the three Rs,knitting &amp;   
 raffia,a stroke of the cane for not   
 knowing a history date.Then there was 
 hot cocoa made by Miss Barwells house_
 keeper,no school dinners,touch &amp; ring 
 games,colourful shuttlecocks &amp; bats   
 during Lent or tops for the boys,stoop
 ball,rounders &amp; races,wearing a sprig 
 of oak on May 29th,trudging through   
 the deep snow during bad winters.In   
 many ways they were hard days but they
 were happy days AND _ MOST IMPORTANT _
 GOOD FRIENDS WERE MADE FOR LIFE!
