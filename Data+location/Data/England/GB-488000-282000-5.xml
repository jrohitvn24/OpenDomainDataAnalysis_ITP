		<title>05RECREATION IN GEDDINGTON</title>
		<content>Geddington has about 20 clubs and      
organisations for recreation. This is a
large number for such a small village  
and even so, many adults spend at least
3 hours each day watching television.  
Most teenagers would like the Youth    
Club in Grafton Road to be improved and
many find travelling to Kettering for  
sporting facilities very expensive and 
inconvenient.                          
Swimming is a popular pastime; many    
residents would like Geddington to have
its own pool even though this would not
be commercially viable.                
Out of the hundred people interviewed  
more people went to the theatre than   
the cinema in the past year but the    
majority had visited neither.          
Most residents in Geddington are       
satisfied with the facilities for      
recreation.
