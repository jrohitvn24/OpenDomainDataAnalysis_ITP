ALSO ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE TOWN THERE
ARE TWO LARGE COUNCIL HOUSE ESTATES.   
THESE ESTATES WERE BUILT BY THE TOWN   
COUNCIL AND THEN LEASED OUT AT VERY LOW
RENTS TO LEEK RESIDENTS. BY DOING THIS 
THE COUNCIL WERE ABLE TO PULL DOWN ALL 
THE VERY OLD HOUSES WHICH WERE UNFIT TO
LIVE IN. TODAY, IF YOU LIVE ON ONE OF  
THE COUNCIL ESTATES YOU MAY BUY THE    
HOUSE YOU LIVE IN IF YOU WANT TO.      
IN THE AREA AROUND LEEK THERE ARE MANY 
STONE COTTAGES AND FARMHOUSES WHICH ARE
STILL IN USE EVEN THOUGH MANY OF THEM  
ARE OVER TWO HUNDRED YEARS OLD. AT THE 
TOP OF THE MARKET SQUARE THERE IS A ROW
OF STONE COTTAGES WHERE IT IS REPUTED  
BONNIE PRINCE CHARLES SLEPT ONE NIGHT  
WHEN HE WAS ON HIS MARCH TO DERBY.     
LEEK HAS THE BENEFIT OF THE NEW HOUSING
ESTATES WHILE STILL RETAINING MUCH OF  
THE ORIGINAL SHAPE OF THE TOWN.        </content>
