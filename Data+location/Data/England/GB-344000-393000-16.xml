		<content>   All the local farmhouses are built  
 of sandstone.This soft sedimentary    
 rock is found all around.             
   The soil is very fertile and farming
 has been carried out here for         
 centuries.                            
   At the back of{Clay Lane Farm}are   
 the remains of a kiln which was used  
 to make clay pipes.Beneath the topsoil
 lies the clay, which would have been  
 used in the pottery industry.         
   Some of the fields are 6' lower than
 others because of{Pilkington's}       
 removing the sand for their{glass     
{industry.}                            
   There are several small streams and 
 brooks in this area,especially in{    
{Chain Acre Wood.}The largest of these 
 is{Mill Brook.}This runs through {    
{Howards Farm.}
