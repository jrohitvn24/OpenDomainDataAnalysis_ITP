 After we had been to visit Tawstock   
 church we went to{Holy Well}primary   
 school. When we got there we saw that 
 the roof of the school was thatched it
 looked lovely but it could easily     
 catch fire. We were told that the     
 school was built in 1830 but there was
 a fire that burnt all the thatched    
 roof in 1939 but fortunately it was   
 replaced just as it was before.{Holy  
{Well}school is very small and has room
 for fifty children but at the moment  
 there are only thirty five children.  
 The playground is very small but it is
 big enough for the few children who   
 use it. After our visit to the school 
 we started the journey back to our    
 school.
