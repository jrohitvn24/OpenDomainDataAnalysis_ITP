		<title>12Local News</title>
		<content>       Local News issues are dealt with
 in a number of{local newspapers:-The  
{Hitchin Gazette;The Hitchin Comet and 
{the North Herts.Mirror on Sunday.     
 However,all of these are inevitably   
{mainly concerned with issues or events
{relating to}the more populated areas  
 of{Hitchin,Letchworth and Stevenage.  
     {"Vandals Misery"is}the main      
 headline in the N.H.M on Sunday.This  
 describes how a water sports          
 enthusiast was attacked and relieved  
 of equipment worth almost Â£1,000 by   
 a group of vandals.Not surprisingly   
{no mention of our area was made in    
{The Hitchin Gazette}either.However,a  
 small article figured in{The Hitchin  
{Comet}about a barn dance in           
 St.Ippolyts in aid of charity.This    
 analysis of local newspapers was{made 
{between Monday May 6th and Sunday May 
{12th 1985.                            </content>
