<title>21Walsall Arboretum</title>
<content>

Sadly the peacocks are gone, as is the model steam railway - and Walsall's famous Illuminations are no more. The Arboretum is now the subject of a 3 year regeneration programme which should be delivered by 2013 and this includes the provision of a new Visitor Centre, the restoration of the 1920s bandstand and improvements to the lake and boathouse with the intention of taking the ambience of the park back to it's former glory - long overdue for an area which became a public park in 1874!   &lt;br />
