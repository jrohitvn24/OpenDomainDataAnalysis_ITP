		<content>In Penkridge there is a variety of     
clubs and societies which are available
for young people. There is a great     
range of Brownies, Guides, Cubs and    
Scouts. Brownies are taken from ages   
7 to 10 and Cubs from 8 to 11. They    
take part in charity appeals and learn 
homecraft and useful skills. The       
Brownies also go on pack holidays and  
practice what they have learnt. Scouts 
and Guides are a follow up from        
Brownies and Cubs.                     
Other groups include The Boys Brigade  
and The Girls Brigade. The Boys Brigade
is similar to the Scouts but it is for 
boys from unsecure homes.              
Red Cross and St. John's help people   
at fetes etc. and Red Cross also helps 
people across the world in need.       
There is also disco dancing and horse  
riding available for children in       
Penkridge.                             </content>
