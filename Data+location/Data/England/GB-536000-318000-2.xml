		<content> Our area  is in the Fens, near the    
 Wash. The land on which we live was   
 reclaimed from the sea, something that
 was started by the Romans and is still
 going on today.We are about two metres
 above sea level, and since the land is
 very flat you can see for miles.      
  To make farming more efficient,      
 farmers used to take down hedges and  
 trees to create larger fields, but    
 this drove the wildlife away as they  
 had no cover to breed and feed        
 in.It has also made our area rather   
 windswept because of the lack of      
 shelter, and many of us have planted  
 hawthorn or leylandii hedges to       
 protect our homes.                    
   The spraying of crops has also had a
 bad effect on wildlife, as even the   
 dykes which criss-cross our area  can 
 be affected.                          
                                       </content>
