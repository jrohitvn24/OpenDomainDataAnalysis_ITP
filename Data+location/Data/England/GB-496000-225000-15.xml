		<title>15THE PLAYGROUP, HOCKLIFFE</title>
		<content> In{1983}a new resident to{Hockliffe } 
 found there wasn't a{playgroup}to help
 mums get together and prepare children
 before starting school. Interested    
 mums and toddlers responded           
 to an advertisement in the{Post }     
{Office}and a{playgroup}was started in 
{Hockliffe House.} The{playgroup}became
 so sucessful that it was soon         
 necessary to find larger premises.    
 The problem was{money.} Enquiries were
 made.  It was possible to get a       
{government grant of Â£6000}to start a  
{playroup.} This plus{Â£3000}from the   
{West Charity}was used to build a      
{playgroup}on spare land next to the   
 playing field.  The{playgroup}is now  
 running well and it is hoped the      
 community will be brought even closer 
 together by running such things as    
 support groups and baby sitting       
 circles at the{playgroup.}            </content>
