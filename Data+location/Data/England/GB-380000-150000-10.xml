		<content>  The church plays an important role in
 the  lives  of  some people and others
 who do  not  attend  church  regularly
 still come to church for christenings,
 marriages and funerals.               
  Special    services    like   Harvest
 Festival and  Rememberance  Sunday are
 very  well  attended.  Social and fund
 raising  events   are  organised   for
 maintenance to the church.            
  A group of bell ringers meet Thursday
 evenings.  Sometimes   exebitions  are
 held  in  the  church  as  it  is  the
 biggest  building   in  the   village.
 Sunday school is held each week.
