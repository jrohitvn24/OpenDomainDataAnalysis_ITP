{HISTORICAL HOUSES. }                  
 There are many fine old houses in this
 area all of which have interesting    
 histories.                            
 BREACH HOUSE. In the church register  
 it is recorded that Margaret Duncalfe 
 of Breach House married Robert Burgess
 of Warford in 1578. The house may have
 been named after a William Bruch or   
 Breech who was Church Warden in 1606. 
 The house has been derelict for some  
 time now.                             
 HANSON HOUSE. John and Mary Hanson    
 built the house after buying the land 
 from the Earl of Shrewbury in 1631.   
 One document from the house tells of a
 John Bradshaw of Bradshaw Hall,       
 Disley. He was a sergeant at Law at   
 Chester Assizes under Oliver Cromwell 
 and was connected with the regicide of
 Charles I.                            </content>
