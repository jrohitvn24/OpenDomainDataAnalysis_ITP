		<content> There is a windmill at the back of    
 Michelle's garden.Lots of people come 
 to look round it.It was built in the  
 year 1832. There is a name plate that 
 can be seen above the doorway.The     
 windmill has been there for 153       
 years.The weather and woodworm have   
 begun to take over a lot of the       
 floor for about two years. Some of the
 windows have been rotting so we had to
 put new ones in.There was a storm in  
 the 1930's and the sails got blown off
 the windmill. We used to play in the  
 windmill when we were younger. There's
 a lot of junk kept in it now.
