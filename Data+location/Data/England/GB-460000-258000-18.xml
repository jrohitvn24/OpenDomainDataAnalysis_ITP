		<title>18 POPULAR CHILDREN'S GAMES</title>
		<content>  My name is Matthew.My favourite game 
is {football}.The object of the game is
to have two teams who try to kick the  
ball into the other team's goal.The    
team with the most goals wins.         
  My friend's favourite game is        
{marbles}.The object of this game is to
roll your marble towards the other     
person's marble.If you hit it you win  
the game and the marble.               
  Nina's favourite game is {netball}.In
this game you have to pass the ball to 
a different player in your team and    
then,when the ball is close enough,you 
have to throw the ball into the net.The
team who does this most times wins the 
game.                                  
  These are our favourite children's   
games.
