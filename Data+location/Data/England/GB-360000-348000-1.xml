		<title>01Rural Area Sth of Nantwich</title>
		<content> The main occupation of the area is    
 dairy farming, with the next main     
 employer being the Abattoir by Sound  
 Common. The Common is approximately 20
 acres and is designated a site of     
 special Scientific Interest as an area
 of lowland heath. The farms are mostly
 100 to 150 acres with fields averaging
 10 acres (range 3 to 20 acres). The   
 main area of occupation is the small  
 village of Ravensmoor, but there are  
 no shops so the villagers, together   
 with the other inhabitants of the area
 do their shopping in Nantwich or      
 Crewe.                                
 Those inhabitants not connected with  
 agriculture either work in Nantwich or
 Crewe two and six miles away          
 respectively.
