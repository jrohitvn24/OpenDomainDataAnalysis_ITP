 The River Exe flows north to south    
 through this block.The old water mill 
 survives in modern form.To east and   
 west of this area predominantly given 
 over to agriculture, is high ground,  
 with small fields.The flat floor of   
 the river valley has much larger      
 fields,resulting from the removal of  
 hedgerows.The ancient north-south     
 route still exists in the form of a   
 road following the valley floor.The   
 branch line ceased to exist in 1964.  
 The BR main line passes from          
 north-east to south-west through the  
 south-east section of the block.      
 The largest village is{REWE,}the      
 remainder of the area having a        
 low,scattered population.Part of the  
 village of {THORVERTON}which has a    
 spring which has never been known to  
 dry up,is in the block.               </content>
