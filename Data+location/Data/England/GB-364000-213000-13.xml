		<title>13Market Atmosphere</title>
		<content> The market is noisy and busy and there
 are alot of people around. There are  
 lots of bargains in a market.There are
 people walking up and down and talking
 to each other.The people wander around
 looking at things for good bargains.In
 the market there are about 80 stalls. 
 There are lots of vans because the    
 stallholders can get their things in  
 and out easily. There are market buses
 which bring people to and from the    
 market at a certain time. There are   
 lots of mothers with babies in prams  
 and toddlers in pushchairs. There is  
 music played all the time which makes 
 the atmosphere happier. The smell of  
 fish'N'chips flows through the        
 market. In the market there are both  
 old people and young people.
