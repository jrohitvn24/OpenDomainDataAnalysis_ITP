		<title>09INFLUENCES:AIRFIELD,QUINTON</title>
		<content>   Although highly{controversial}in    
 many ways, there is no doubt that the 
{airfield at Long Marston,}and other   
 military air bases ,affects the lives 
 of the inhabitants of Quinton.        
   Pre-war farmland, Long Marston      
 airfield was created for military use 
 and has only partially returned to its
 former use as a farm.                 
   Nowadays,{activities on the airfield
 include some light industry ( pallet  
 making and aircraft assembly and      
 repair) as well as microlighting,     
 parachuting, drag-racing,&amp; gliding.Car
 boot fairs,steam traction and caravan 
 rallies add to the activities.Amidst  
 this, sheep graze and crops grow.     
   Meanwhile,{military aircraft}from   
 bases further afield,  seem to compete
 in getting as close as possible to    
 Meon Hill without denting it.
