		<title>01HALLATON - SLAWSTON - CRANOE</title>
		<content> Our 12 sq km block is a fairly remote,
 picturesque and sparsely populated    
 part of south-east Leicestershire. The
 area is mostly rich agricultural land,
 with three centres of population: the 
 villages of Hallaton (pop 400) and    
 Slawston (pop 81), and the hamlet of  
 Cranoe (pop 32). They are still       
 basically rural communities, although 
 there is a slow influx of commuters.  
 The area contains a broad spectrum of 
 people, ranging from farm workers in  
 charity cottages to company directors 
 in large period houses. Community life
 centres broadly around Church         
 activities, and in Hallaton around the
 Sports and Social Club and pubs as    
 well.                                 
 In summary, it is an extremely pleas- 
 ant corner of England, untouched by   
 many of the problems and attitudes of 
 modern urban life.                    </content>
