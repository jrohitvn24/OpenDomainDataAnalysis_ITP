		<title>13The Patchway Gypsy Camp</title>
		<content> "I think the gypsy camp is a messy,   
 dirty place. I would be glad if they  
 moved. Once they tried to move onto   
 the field outside our school. In 1977 
 there was a protest about them by the 
 community centre."                    
  "They are untidy and I think its a   
 bit sad that they can't roam the      
 country like they used to, and I would
 like them to educate their children   
 more,"                                
  "They should have their own houses   
 and shops instead of using ours       
 because they make the place smell"    
  "They're dirty and smelly and they   
 take things apart, they steal things  
 and they're cruel to their horses."   
 "I think gypsies are thieves and very 
 dirty and they never pay their taxes. 
 They have lots of money and a lot of  
 horses."
