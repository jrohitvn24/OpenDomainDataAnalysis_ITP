		<content>{ELASTIC}-3 girls are needed to play.A 
 piece of elastic is joined to form a  
 circle.2 girls stand facing each other
 the elastic round their ankles.A 3rd  
 girl stands with one leg between the  
 elastic,the other,outside.She then    
 jumps,so that the leg which was inside
 is now outside,&amp; vice versa.This is   
 repeated 4 times.Then she jumps &amp;     
 lands with both legs inside,both      
 outside &amp; finally ON the elastic.A    
 rhyme said during the jumping is:-    
 "England,Ireland,Scotland,Wales;Inside
 Outside,Tread."If she makes a mistake 
 her turn is over.                     
{KERBIE}-A ball and 2 people are needed
 They stand on opposite sides of the   
 road.The 1st person throws the ball at
 the opposite kerb.If the ball hits the
 kerb &amp; bounces back,it's one point.If 
 they miss,the 2nd person has a turn.  
 The first to reach 10 points,wins.    </content>
