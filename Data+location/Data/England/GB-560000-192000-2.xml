		<content>  The area is a series of erosion      
 surfaces, capped with river gravels   
 and glacial clays and sands, cut into 
 older clays and sands. Small streams  
 issuing from the sands have eroded    
 gemtle valleys. However, the main     
 features of our landscape are         
 influenced by man.                    
  The farmland varies from open        
 "prarie" (638922) with straight       
 drainage ditches to small fields with 
 hedgerows (626942). Large residual    
 patches of woodland (603921) have     
 amenity value, whilst other open space
 is for recreation. The remaining 40%  
 of the area is built-up, but          
 interspearsed with many mature trees. 
 The suburban commuters' houses are    
 arranged in estates. The most         
 remarkable feature of the landscape is
 the abrupt urban-rural transition     
 along the "Green-Belt" policy.        </content>
