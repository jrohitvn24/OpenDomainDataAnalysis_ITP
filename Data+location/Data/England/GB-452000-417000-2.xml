		<title>02QUARRY NEAR WOMERSLEY.</title>
		<content> The quarry has been open since the    
 early 1970's. There are many types of 
 stone been quarried, the main two     
 being Permian Limestone and Yorkshire 
 Stone.The stone is excavated out of   
 the ground as explosives are too      
 dangerous to use.The types of         
 machinery used for taking stone out of
 the ground are bulldozers, face       
 shovels, and drills.                  
 From Sep-84 to Sep-85 approximately   
 150,000 tonnes of stone were          
 excavated. The present rate of        
 excavating has increased to 800 tonnes
 per day ( 280,000 per year), giving   
 the quarry a total life span of about 
 another 3 years. The stone is cut and 
 sold to building contractors all over 
 yorkshire.                            
 The quarry employs 20 men, 18 of them 
 live in Doncaster and 2 in            
 Knaresborough.                        </content>
