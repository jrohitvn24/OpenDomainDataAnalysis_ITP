		<title>03OLD PEOPLE'S MEMORIES.</title>
		<content> Two of us were trying to find out how 
 far people could remember about their 
 life.We are interviewing mostly old   
 people with an exception of some      
 younger adults as well. In our{D-block
 which is Easthorpe and a small part of
 Messing,there are not many old people 
 but some people are very co-operative 
 and we got quite a lot of information.
    Apparently Easthorpe hasn't changed
 much over the years,but a new estate  
 has been built and more people have   
 moved in.The traffic is gradually     
 growing buisier because of this.      
 The fields have got much bigger in    
 size because the farmers have pulled  
 down the hedges to get more produce in
 the way of crops.The food has changed 
 somewhat because they didn't have     
 things like sugarbeet and rape as we  
 have nowadays.                        
                                       </content>
