{"POUNDISFORD PARK},near Taunton, now  
 owned by Mr.and Mrs Ralph Vivian-Neal,
 is a charming example of Tudor country
 architecture started in 1546 and      
 perfectly preserved with little later 
 alteration.It is set in the former    
{deer park}of Taunton Castle.Several   
 fine plaster ceilings of the period   
 are complemented by furniture,        
 portraits and interesting small       
 collections of porcelain and of       
 costumes.It has always been very much 
 a family home,but among the many      
 visitors who stayed over the years was
 Queen Anne,wife of James 1. The simple
 garden is typical of the Tudor style  
 and has views over the towards the    
 Quantock and Blackdown Hills."
