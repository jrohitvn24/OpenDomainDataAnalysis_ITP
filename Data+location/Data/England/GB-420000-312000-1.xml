  Our project block is a rectangle 4   
kms by 3kms. Of this total area less   
than 1sq km is covered by the village  
of Edingale which is the only          
residential area in the block. The rest
of the area is undulating, fertile     
farmland. The fields vary in size      
between about 90 acres to small        
paddocks. They are usually bounded by  
hedges and there are several small     
copses of deciduous trees. A few of the
fields provide grazing for sheep and   
cattle but the vast majority are under 
arable crops such as cereals, oil-seed 
rape and beans.                        
    There are a few small fields to the
east of the village of Edingale which  
house shire horses. The shire horses of
Edingale are well-known but recently   
Mr. Holland, who bred them, has retired
and sold most of his stock.            </content>
