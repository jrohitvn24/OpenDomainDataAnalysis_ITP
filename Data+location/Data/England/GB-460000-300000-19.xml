		<content> A new road is to be built linking up  
 the motorways with the A47 in the     
 north east. It is to go over the      
 existing Ring Road. Residents do not  
 like the idea of a road carrying      
 traffic passing through a residential 
 area of the city.                     
 A new shopping complex has been built 
 near the 'Woolco'. It is a 'Kwiksave' 
 precinct. It is bound to provide      
 competition for the present 'Woolco'. 
 'Woolco' have had difficulties        
 recently with rain leaking through    
 the ceiling, now stained with brown   
 patches. The building was designed    
 with car-parking facilities on its    
 roof.                                 
 Complaints continue about the speed of
 traffic down the London Road. It is   
 not wide enough for two lanes  but    
 motorists form them by overtaking and 
 often breaking the 30mph limit.       </content>
