		<content> We interviewed 60 people, 49 were born
 somewhere other than Malvern, and 11  
 were  natives. Most lived in detatched
 or sem-detatched houses which they    
 owned themselves. Twelve lived in     
 bungalows eight in flats and two in   
 terraced houses. Most people chose gas
 for heating and cooking. The average  
 house had five or six rooms, but one  
 house had fourteen rooms and another  
 had only two. Almost everyone had a   
 television and telephone. 15% had home
 computers and 25% had video recorders.
 The average family had three or fewer 
 children and had dogs as pets. Almost 
 half the people belonged to clubs or  
 societies, but only seven belonged to 
 charity organisations, and most       
 visited pubs sometimes.
