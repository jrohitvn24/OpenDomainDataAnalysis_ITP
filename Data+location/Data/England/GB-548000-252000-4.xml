		<content>   COPLEY HILL FARM - 390 acres.       
 Privately owned. There are 6 houses on
 the farm, owned by the farmer and     
 rented mainly to his workers. There   
 are 10 adults and 5 children in       
 residence. 23 acres are taken up by   
 deciduous woodland, mainly ash,       
 sycamore and beech, although many     
 beech trees died of fungal disease in 
 recent years.                         
   In 1920 the area was used mainly for
 sheep farming, with poor soil, which  
 was infested with rabbits. The soil   
 improved with the help of modern      
 fertilisers, to become used more for  
 arable crops.{                        
 LOCAL HISTORY  A Tumulus (Roman Burial
 Mound) is Copley Hill. A Roman Road   
 runs on the northern boundary of the  
 farm. Remains of a Roman Villa are    
 present, but only become apparent when
 seen from the air.                    </content>
