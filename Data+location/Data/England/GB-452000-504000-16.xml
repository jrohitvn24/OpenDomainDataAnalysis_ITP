  Block 1.2.3. is a game that you play 
 with about 5 people.One counts to 100 
 and  the others hide.The person       
 counting has a blocking place which   
 the others have to get to while the   
 counter is somewhere else.If they do  
 they get freedom and are not on.The   
 counter catches you by getting to the 
 post before you and saying "Block     
 1.2.3".The first to be caught is on.  
 This is the most popular game.
