 In Markyate we have two{Brownie}packs.
 This is because there are so many     
 people who want to be members.They    
 meet on Mondays but there are two     
 sessions.The first session is from    
 4.30 to 6.00 and the second session   
 is from 6.00 to 7.30. They meet at the
 Youth and Community Centre.           
 Subsriptions are 25p per week. Each   
 pack is divided into groups of 6 known
 as "sixes" with names such as Gnomes, 
 Pixes, Elves, Leprechauns, Sprites,   
 Goblins, Imps and Kelpies. Each  group
 is led by a different leader called a 
 "Brown Owl". Each week they play games
 such as "Yes and No", "Cat and Mouse",
 "Sausages" and "Noughts and Crosses". 
 On fine days they go to the fields    
 and play.
