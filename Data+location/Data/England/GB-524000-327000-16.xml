		<title>16The Leaning Spire.</title>
		<content>{     }How many tipplers, emerging from
 the "Crown" and gazing heavenwards    
 upon the spire, have turned to stagger
 back for "just one more"?  The church 
 tower, whose spire leans seven feet   
 out of vertical, seems to hover in a  
 frozen "fall" across the road.        
{ }    No traveller, passing through   
 the village, could overlook the       
 rakish lean of St.Laurence's spire.   
 The visitor is told how, centuries    
 ago, the stones began to lean even as 
 the ancient workers set them up.      
 Undeterred, they carried on and       
 Surfleet has a spire to rival         
 Chesterfield.  Indeed, we have a      
 fenland Pisa tower defying gravity    
 centuries before Newton.              
       The capital has Big Ben,        
 Edinburgh the Rock, but our symbol is 
 St.Laurence spire, nonchalent yet     
 strong as time.                       </content>
