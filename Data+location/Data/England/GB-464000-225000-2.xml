		<title>02Ecology in the Twyford Area</title>
		<content> In our rural block it is a familiar   
 sight to see{small mammals}such as    
 rabbits,foxes and hedgehogs.There are 
 various small ponds,ditches and a     
 river which supports a variety of     
 fish,water birds and amphibians.There 
 is a scattering of trees along hedges 
 and in fields.In the last few years   
 Dutch Elm Disease has wiped our elm   
 trees.Public footpaths or bridleways  
 link Twyford to Godington,Twyford to  
 Three Bridge Mill,Twyford to Cowley   
 Farm.There are many other short       
 footpaths.The climate averages 25     
 inches of rain a year,summers can be  
 wet or dry,summer temperatures of     
 22,23 degrees C are good.Short cold   
 spells of -10,-12 overnight occur in  
 winter.A small amount of air pollution
 is received from the local brickworks 
 and the straw burning at harvest time.
