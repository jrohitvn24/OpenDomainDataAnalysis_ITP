		<title>18WEST MONKTON PRIMARY SCHOOL.</title>
		<content>  The children and teachers have just  
 moved to new buildings,some 50 metres 
 along School Road.The old building(in 
 use for 139 years)proved to be out of 
 date.                                 
  The children treated the move as a   
 big adventure.They like the new clean 
 toilets and big playing fields.The    
 headmaster said he prefered the new   
 building because of the facilities,but
 he missed the old for its character.  
 The new school has a main building and
 one mobile classroom.                 
  There are 4 classes of about 26 kids.
 The head teaches one of these.He does 
 the administration on Wednesday and   
 Thursday mornings;a part time teacher 
 takes his class.                      
  40-50 children have school meals.The 
 children love sport.The school netball
 and football kits are purple,the same 
 colour as the school uniform.         </content>
