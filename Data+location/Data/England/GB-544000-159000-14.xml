		<title>14 CUDHAM - CHURCH BELLS</title>
		<content> Cudham church tower,the oldest part of
the church, houses ten bells, they are 
hung in two layers because the belfry  
space is limited.                      
 Reputed to be the 3rd lightest set of 
ten bells in the country, the smallest 
(treble) is only 2.5 cwt and the       
largest (tenor) is 9.5 cwt in weight.  
  The oldest bell was cast in 1490 but 
others have been added since, the last 
4 in 1930. The bells are housed in the 
steeple with the ringing room directly 
below and reached by a steep, wooden   
staircase.                             
  Each bell plays a different note     
(A,B,C#,D,E,F#,G#,A,B,C#). There is a  
"sally" of wool on each rope so that   
the ringer's hands are protected from  
rope burns.  The tenor bell chimes     
each hour, and all the bells are used  
for services.  Bell ringing practice   
is on Monday nights.                   </content>
