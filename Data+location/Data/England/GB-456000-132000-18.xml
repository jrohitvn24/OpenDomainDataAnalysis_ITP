		<title>18ALRESFORD MARKET</title>
		<content>    In the 14th. Century Alresford was 
 an important wool centre and market.  
 These eventually became the market in 
 Broad St. where there were open stalls
 for meat, fish and farm produce.      
    Every Thursday the market scene    
 returns and the town is even more busy
 and alive. Today the stalls are very  
 similar to those of 200 years ago the 
 people still bustle about examining   
 the goods for sale.The live stock is  
 missing but there is still the        
 atmosphere of the rural market town.  
 Farm produce is fresh and plants for  
 sale are strong and cared for.A clay  
 pottery stall caters for the County   
 Set while a clothes seller provides a 
 service to all those seeking a        
 bargain. Crockery and Books are       
 eagerly sifted and purchases made. The
 market gives soul to the life of the  
 town.                                 </content>
