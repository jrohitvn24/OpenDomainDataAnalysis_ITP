		<content> Most of the houses in Peak Forest     
 are built of{limestone.}The older     
 houses used to have grey slate        
 (gritstone) roofs and gritstone was   
 often used for window surrounds and   
 quoins.                               
  Traditional barns were built in the  
 same way but are nowadays usually     
 built with a concrete framework,      
 concrete lower walls and corrugated   
 sheeting for the upper walls and roof.
  Most new houses are made to look     
{traditional}using modern materials    
 where appropriate.{Planning controls  
 often require small windows, hardrow  
 tiles to look like grey slates and    
 limestone is often used with an inner 
 skin of concrete blocks or bricks.    
  There is{friction}at times with the  
 Peak Park Planning Board over planning
 controls .
