		<title>04Housing in Bristol</title>
		<content> In Bristol there are some new town    
 houses, which are near to the {Docks} 
 and if you looked out of the windows  
 of them, you would probably have a    
 very nice view. So, of course, they   
 are very expensive.  They are built of
 red brick and have central heating.   
 The room are very small.  Gardens are 
 what everybody looks for, so they have
 gardens as well as garages.  No       
 pollution with these houses - they    
 have not got any chimneys.            
                                       
 There are also a lot of flats in      
 Bristol. Some of them have balconies. 
 In the flats they have 2 or 3         
 bedrooms, a kitchen, a bathroom with a
 bath and toilet in it and a living    
 room.  If you are on the top floor you
 sometimes have an attic.              
                                       
                                       </content>
