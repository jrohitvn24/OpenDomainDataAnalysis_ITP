		<title>14TOURISM IN STRETTON</title>
		<content>   The shops in Stretton depend quite  
 a lot on business brought by tourists.
 Without tourists many shopping        
 businesses would not thrive as they   
 do.                                   
   The market comes on Thursday and    
 tourists are likely to come. It       
 attracts people constantly because of 
 the natural market atmostphere and the
 cheap fruit and vegetables.           
   The park attracts people. Generally 
 people with children but some without 
 come for the pleasure of it.          
   The Rectory Wood, owned by the      
 Shropshire County Council is a good   
 tourist attraction, along with Ragleth
 Wood.                                 
   Tourists can stay in either{The Long
{Mynd Hotel, The Sandford Hotel, The   
{Denehurst Hotel}or if they prefer,    
 there are small guest houses and bed  
 and breakfast places.                 </content>
