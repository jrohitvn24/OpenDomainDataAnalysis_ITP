		<title>13Highland Farm</title>
		<content>{Highland Farm} is owned and managed by
my Dad, Mr D. Greasby. He has worked on
his farm for ten years and has two farm
workers beside himself. He gets up at  
6.55am every morning.                  
On the farm he grows barley,wheat,     
oilseed rape, potatoes, and grass. 1985
been an average year for crops. The    
farm has 230 acres of land. As well as 
crops he has got 1000 pigs and 70 beef 
cattle.                                
To help with the work on the farm he   
has some machinary including a Molty   
handler, a combine harvester, a        
seedrill, mill and mix feeder, disc    
harrow, potato harvester, bailor,      
sprayer, pneumatic spreader, 4 tractors
4 trailors, 2 ploughs, and 2           
cultivators. Last year crops were more 
successful than cattle. He enjoys      
working on the farm but at times it    
can be very hard work. (Kate Greasby)  </content>
