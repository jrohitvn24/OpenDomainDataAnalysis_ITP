		<title>13OUR SCHOOL DAY  (cont)</title>
		<content> When it is 10.30a.m. we go out to     
 play.  At the end of playtime a       
 whistle is blown and we all gather    
 around the teacher and then go into   
 our class again.  On the toilet block 
 wall outside there are pictures of a  
 jungle and a space scene painted by   
 some parents.  At twelve o'clock we   
 eat our sandwiches as there is no     
 kitchen which can give us a hot       
 meal.In the afternoon we might go to  
 our field, carrying our footballs,    
 rounders' bats and posts.  We sing in 
 our classroom to a tape and play      
 various instruments.  We even paint in
 our room and wash up the brushes and  
 palettes in the cloakroom amongst our 
 coats.  When we all go into the       
 cloakroom to collect our coats and    
 bags there's a dreadful squash.
