		<title>15PLAYGROUND GAMES OF THE 80's</title>
		<content>   One of the favourite{playground     
{games}at school is{KINGY.}It's a good 
 game because lots and lots of people  
 can play. You stand in a circle with  
 your legs open, someone drops a tennis
 ball in the centre of the circle and  
 whose ever legs the ball goes through 
 is on. They immediately pick up the   
 ball and try and hit the rest. The    
 game continues until everyone has been
 hit.                                  
  {CANNON}is another popular game for  
 the playground but for this you need  
 equal sides. You set up four pegs     
 against a wall, in the same formation 
 as a set of wickets and then you throw
 a ball at them.Whatever pegs have been
 knocked down must be built up again   
 whilst the other team try and hit     
 people with the ball. When hit that   
 team member is out and remains out    
 until 3 cannons have been built.      </content>
