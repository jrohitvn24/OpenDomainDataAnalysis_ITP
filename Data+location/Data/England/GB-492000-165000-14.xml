		<title>14ASCOT DAY CENTRE</title>
		<content> Ascot day centre is a place where old 
 people can come and spend their day.It
 opens at 10a.m. and closes at 4.30p.m.
 In the morning the old people have    
 coffee and bicuits followed by a      
 cooked lunch at lunchtime and tea and 
 cakes in the afternoon.Haircuts are   
 cheaply obtained at the centre.Special
 occasions are celebrated with the help
 of the brownies who come into help.At 
 the moment the centre comprises 2 terr
 -apins joined together but a new cetre
 built of brick is just starting to be 
 built.The old centre held 80 people   
 but the new one will hold 100 people. 
 There is a nice garden attached to the
 centre which will be kept and the open
 space to the rear of the centre will  
 continue to be used as allotments.
