  In our block one of the main kinds of
 transport is buses.An adult took us to
 Weston's bus station.One of the       
 drivers took us to the manager so we  
 could ask  some questions.Ernie Wise  
 came to Weston to exchange the green  
 buses for 45 mini buses.These are     
 called the Badger Line Buses or mini  
 _link.The buses are brightly coloured.
 Inside the buses they are much more   
 comfortable .They are much quicker    
 because they are smaller.Our area also
 has Coastriders which are open-air    
 buses.We asked the manager what do you
 do when it starts to rain. The manager
 said:"If it is just spitting we leave 
 it out there but if it tips down we   
 replace it with a bus with a roof".   
 They also have Swift-Link and Double  
 Deckers.Buses run every five to ten   
 minutes around Weston and Worle.      </content>
