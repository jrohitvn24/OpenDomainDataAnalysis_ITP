		<title>06Farming(1) in Leverton</title>
		<content> Much of the land in our village is    
 used for farming,particularly arable  
 farming.The soil is very rich silt and
 can usually produce two crops per year
 especially of "greens",cabbage(spring 
 and hard white) and cauliflowers.The  
 other main crops grown are potatoes,  
 sprouts,sugar beet,peas and beans and 
 cereals especially wheat and barley.  
 Soft fruit is no longer commercially  
 grown but many people grow a small    
 amount for their own use.Grass land   
 for grazing is now very scarce being  
 restricted to about 50 or so acres.   
 In the past many of the village people
 were employed working on the land     
 but modern implements and greater     
 mechanization means fewer people are  
 now employed to produce far more food.
 Greater mechanization also means      
 larger fields and fewer hedges and    
 trees for the wildlife.               </content>
