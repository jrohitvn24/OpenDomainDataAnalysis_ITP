		<title>19Coalville - the future !</title>
		<content>   The North-West Leicestershire       
 Coalfield is nearing the end of its   
{economic viability.}It is likely that 
 coal will cease to be mined in this   
 area some time during the next decade.
 The mining industry has been the main 
 employer in this area since the early 
 part of the nineteenth century.       
 Population movement away from the     
 Coalville area seems likely as mines  
 are developed in other regions. If the
 area is to develop in the future it   
 will need to change.                  
   The youth of Coalville do not seem  
 to be optimistic about the future as  
 problems of{unemployment}dominate     
 nationally.                           
   It remains to be seen how the area  
 can regenerate itself and in what ways
 the Dictrict Council can seek to      
 attract both industry and inhabitants.
