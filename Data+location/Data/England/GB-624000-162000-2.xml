		<content> The{River Stour}follows a natural     
 course winding across its floodplain  
 through the Stourmouth area. Its most 
 important use to the community is as a
 drain, as most of the area is prone to
 flooding in the winter. Secondly for  
{irrigation;}water is taken off through
 a complex system of dykes to render   
 the marshes fertile in even the dryest
 summer.The{Little Stour}(part of the  
 course of which is man made) performs 
 a similar function, draining another  
 valley. Both rivers were used for     
 communication until this century.Today
 the secondary use of the waterways is 
 for{recreation.}Anglers prize the     
 Stour for its specimen Bream and      
 Roach.Clubs come from all over the    
 country to fish these waters.         
 Boatowners have moorings at Plucks    
 Gutter.Hikers and naturalist walk the 
 banks.                                </content>
