		<title>02SHOPPING SURVEY</title>
		<content>  The children of Hinstock School made 
 a study of 46 houses that stretched   
 diagonally across the area. We found  
 that 60% of the households did their  
 main shopping at Market Drayton and   
 all but one of the rest shopped at    
 Newport. Both townships are about 5   
 miles away from the centre of the     
 area. One household (a one parent     
 family) shopped solely at the small   
 village shop at Hinstock.             
  It was found that most households    
 did their main shop once a week       
 supplimenting this with visits to the 
 local shop.                           
  80% of the households used their     
 own transport to shop, the rest used  
 public transport.
