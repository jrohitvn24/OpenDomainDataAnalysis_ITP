		<title>06A DAY IN MY LIFE IN BUNNY</title>
		<content> My name is{Samantha Jane Cooke.}I am  
 eleven years old and I live in Bunny. 
 I wake up at seven o'clock in the     
 morning. I go to the bathroom for a   
 wash, clean my teeth and get dressed. 
 Then I brush my hair and go downstairs
 and have my breakfast which is a piece
 of toast and I listen to the radio.   
 After breakfast I take my two dogs for
 a little walk and feed my guinea pig. 
 Then I call for my friend Louise and  
 all my other friends meet me there. At
 eight thirty we walk to{Bunny School. 
 We talk in the playground. The bell   
 goes at nine o'clock and we start     
 work. I stay at school for my dinner. 
 After school I go home and get changed
 for gymnastics. Then I go to meet my  
 friend and her mum takes us to the    
 gymnasium. We leave at nine o'clock.  
 I have a glass of milk and watch TV.  
 before I go to bed at ten o'clock.    </content>
