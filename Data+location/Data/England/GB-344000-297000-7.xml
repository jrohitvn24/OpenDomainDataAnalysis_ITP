		<content>  This is a picturesque hamlet with    
 several fine old houses and a 13th    
 Century church.One of the oldest      
 buildings is a black &amp; white cruck    
 house dating from circa 1450.There are
 a few modern houses on the fringe of  
 the hamlet.                           
  The residents of the village are     
 mostly connected with farming but     
 there are a few families of newcomers 
 who work elsewhere.One attractive farm
 house manages to combine a thriving   
 Bed &amp; Breakfast business with a       
 working farm.The Village Hall was     
 built in 1860 and had fallen into dis-
 use by the end of World War II. Owner-
 ship by the Bishop of Hereford has now
 been established and consideration is 
 being given to its possible future use
  The residents of Woolstaston have a  
 strong sense of identity and a close  
 community spirit.                     </content>
