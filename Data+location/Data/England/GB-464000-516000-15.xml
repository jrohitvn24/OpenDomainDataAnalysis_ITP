		<title>15LOCAL HISTORY-Skelton Castle</title>
		<content>      Robert De Brus(second) built a   
 castle at Skelton about 1140. It was  
 made of stone and had 2 look-out      
 towers, dungeons, and a moat with a   
 drawbridge and portcullis.            
      Over the years the castle became 
 neglected. It started to crumble and  
 rats and frogs lived in the dungeons  
 and cellars. People called it "Crazy  
 Castle".                              
      John Hall Stevenson inherited    
 this in 1786. His great grandmother   
 was very rich. Before she married, her
 name was Wharton, and she said she    
 would give him all of her money if he 
 changed his name to Wharton, so he    
 did. He built a new castle in 1788    
 with front-extensions in 1810. Mrs.   
 Margaret Winsome Ringrose Wharton owns
 the castle now but her relative, Major
 Wharton, runs the estates as she is   
 too old to do it herself.             </content>
