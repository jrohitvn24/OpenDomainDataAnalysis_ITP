		<content>   The{Royal Hotel}was built in the    
 year 1845.It was opened by Queen Anne 
 later that year.The Hotel is owned by 
 Crest Hotels and it stands on Bath    
 Street.The Royal Hotel was built to   
 house visitors to the Bath Grounds.   
   Here there were large pools for     
 bathing.As there was no springs at    
 Ashby,the water was transported from  
 a natural spring at nearby Moira.     
   The Hotel is unique because all the 
 rooms are different shaped.There are  
 40 members of staff working there.    
   During the Easter Bank Holiday the  
 Hotel provides accomadation for the   
 carnival guest of honour .The carnival
 takes place on the Bath Grounds,but   
 first there is a prosession along     
 some of Ashby's streets.Some of the   
 famous people who have attended the   
 carnival are Simon Groome ,Rod Hull   
 and Emu and John Pertwee.             </content>
