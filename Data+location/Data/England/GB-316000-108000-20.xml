		<title>20SMEATHARPE - THE RUSTIC LIFE</title>
		<content> It is a cultural shock for the town   
 person who comes to live in the       
 country.  No - there really is no bus,
 no pub, and no fish and chip shop!    
 However, soon other facets of country 
 life begin to shine.                  
 At first many things seem rather      
 quaint - the Village Fete or Harvest  
 Home.  When they are able to be in-   
 volved and feel part of (rather than  
 bemused by) country life, they are no 
 longer newcomers.                     
 Many townpeople may feel more worldly-
 wise than their rustic neighbours.    
 Perhaps they are, but they may learn  
 to respect the knowledge of the count-
 ryside and the neighbourliness which  
 people born in the country often have.
 Rural life - one man's meat but       
 another man's poison!
