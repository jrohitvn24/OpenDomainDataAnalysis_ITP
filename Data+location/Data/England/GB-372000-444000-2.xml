		<content>The general impression is of stone     
constructions,and roughcast rendering  
of whole walls or panels.The farm      
buildings and field walls are sand-    
stone,with limestone towards Ch'burn.  
Original roofs are of stone and slate; 
renovation often of grey slate.Early   
cottages are of stone or roughcast     
rendered.Terraced rows are of stone;   
later of brick and rendered above.Pre- 
war detached/semi-detached houses and  
bungalows are brick or stone rendered  
above.Post-war rows and estates use    
various coloured bricks for blending   
into the landscape.Later buildings are 
often faced with re-constituted or re- 
used stone.Roof tiles are often factory
made.Chimneys are on most roofs.Cotton 
mills,churches and schools are standing
in each village.There are about20      
listed buildings of special            
architectural or historic interest.    </content>
