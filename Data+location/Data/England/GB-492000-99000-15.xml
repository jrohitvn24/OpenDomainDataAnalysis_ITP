 club known as the Rocks with about    
 4000 supporters.                      
  The town is provided with facilities 
 for most sports.                      
  {Hotham Park}offers tennis courts,a  
 small zoo,peaceful walks among rare   
 trees, a children's railway,crazy     
 golf, putting and a boating lake.     
  To the East in Felpham there is the {
{Arun Leisure Centre}.                 
  There is no swimming pool in Bognor(a
 new pool for the Arun District being  
 sited at Littlehampton much to the    
 annoyance of the population of        
 Bognor). Bognor Regis Comprehensive   
 School has its own indoor pool which  
 is heavily used and swimming clubs    
 have {limited }use of the swimming    
 facilities at Butlins.                
  The beach allows such sports as
