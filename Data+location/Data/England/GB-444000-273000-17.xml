		<content>  An indoor game which I enjoy is      
 called 'Subbuteo' which is table      
 soccer. To play this game there are 22
 small figures which represent two     
 soccer teams,each of the figures has a
 small weight at the bottom to keep it 
 upright.The players are flicked so    
 that the ball can be put into the net 
 to score a goal.Each team has three   
 tries to hit the ball by flicking it, 
 if they fail then the ball goes to the
 opposition for their turn.The other   
 rules are the same as for real soccer 
 even down to the awarding of          
 'Penalties' for a 'Foul' near the goal
 mouth.                                
  Each team is made of plastic and     
 represents one of the 92 Football     
 League clubs,each team can be bought  
 separately for about Â£1.99.The game is
 played on a board which is about 130cm
 long and lasts as long as necessary.  </content>
