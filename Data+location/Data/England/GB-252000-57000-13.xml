		<content>   In our area there are many species  
 of mammals to look out for.Most of    
 them live in the fields and woods.    
   In Cann woods there are roe and     
 fallow deer.Badgers live in the woods,
 but are usually seen on the side of   
 the road as traffic casualties.Foxes  
 are also mainly seen in Cann Woods.   
   There are hedgehogs and squirrels in
 our area.They are fairly common and   
 you can find them in gardens and in   
 the woods.Stoats and weasels are      
 present but aren't all that common    
 because they are frightened of people.
 Rabbits are common on pasture land.   
   Most of the common British rodents  
 can be found in the area,water voles  
 on the river,wood mice in the woods,  
 house mice around buildings and field 
 and bank voles in the hedges.
