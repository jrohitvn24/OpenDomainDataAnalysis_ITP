		<title>13GAMES PLAYED IN LOSSIEMOUTH.</title>
		<content> We play many different games at school
 and at home.Here are some of the most 
 popular."HIDE AND SEEK",in which there
 are several "Hiders" and one          
 "Seeker",who will close his eyes and  
 count to 100 or 200.While he is       
 counting,the "Hiders"run and hide in  
 various ingenious places.When the     
 "Seeker"has finished counting,he      
 goesin search of the"Hiders".The      
 "Hider" tries to reach the "DEN"before
 the "Seeker" can catch him.The person 
 who is caught first is the next       
 "Seeker".{"CATCH AND HELP"}is another 
 popular game.One person is "IT"and he 
 tries to catch the other players.When 
 a player is caught he then has to help
 to catch other players.The game ends  
 when everyone os caught.
