		<content> Countesthorpe is notorious for        
 its 'different' type of schools.      
 Countesthorpe nursery school is for   
 the three to five year olds. It isn't 
 compulsory to go there and many       
 parents send their children to play - 
 school instead which is not run by the
 Education Authority.                  
 The infant and junior schools  cater  
 for the five to eleven year olds.     
 Leysland High School (11-14) and      
 Countesthorpe College (14-16/18) run  
 slightly differently to most schools, 
 children don't wear a uniform and they
 call their teachers by their christian
 names. This is to form closer         
 relationships between teachers and    
 pupils.                               
 All pupils have dance,drama and music 
 lessons and take part in all aspects  
 of design.
