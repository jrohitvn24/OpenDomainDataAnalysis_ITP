		<content>   {Adbolton Hall}is now a private     
 nursing home for elderly people. It   
 stands in five acres of grounds just  
 off the lane which leads to the Holme 
 Pierrepont Watersports Centre.        
 Originally it was a private house     
 owned latterly by the{Turney}family   
 who owned a leather works in          
 Nottingham. The trees in the grounds  
 are very beautiful.                   
    The Hall has been used as a nursing
 home for some years now and in July   
 1984 a new extension was added to give
 them more accommodation.              
    The house still has its original   
 wooden doors and a lovely wooden      
 staircase with big newel posts. The   
 day room was originally the dining    
 room and at the end of the room there 
 is a beautiful big hand-carved        
 fireplace.
