		<title>13Living in a Hotel</title>
		<content>  Living in a hotel is o.k. sometimes  
 but sometimes it's awful.             
  The times that it is awful is when   
 the telephone is always ringing with  
 people who want rooms.The reception   
 bell is always going so people are    
 always rushing up and down stairs.Your
 mum is never around when you want     
 her.You can never get into the kitchen
 because someone is cooking breakfast  
 or dinner.If there aren't enough rooms
 for the staff downstairs,you have to  
 have your bedrooms at the top of the  
 hotel.                                
  One of the good things about living  
 in a hotel is that you get the meals  
 that the guests have,because the chef 
 cooks extra food.Another good thing   
 is that sometimes your mum wants you  
 to go away because you keep annoying  
 her,so you can go to the pier with    
 your friends.   Kathryn Thompson      </content>
