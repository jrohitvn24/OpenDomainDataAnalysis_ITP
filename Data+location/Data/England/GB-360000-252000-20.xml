		<content> Drained by River Lodon,Hackley Brook. 
 Three natural springs,one in village; 
 still providing fresh water and water-
 cress for villagers.                  
   North West of Hawkhurst,on the River
 Lodon,is a natural ford,a weir is down
 river above Hyde Bridge.              
   Nature of ground is mainly pasture; 
 although wheat,barley and rape seed   
 are grown throughout area.Common      
 Market subsidies have recently        
 encouraged the spread of the rape seed
 crop.                                 
   Some evidence of medieval strip     
 farming_mixed fields,scattered        
 ownership of fields.Animals;pigs,dairy
 cattle and sheep,are commonly farmed. 
 Trees are scattered and mainly        
 deciduous.                            
   Due to location,Pencombe Village    
 remains isolated during heavy snow.   
 Flooding blocks main access roads.    </content>
