		<content> The entrance porch and font of St     
 Nicholas's Church are of Norman date  
 and could well have been here at the  
 original Domesday survey.In the 19th  
 century the church was known as St    
 Peter's but documents giving the      
 original dedication have been found.  
     There is a regular attendance at  
 all services which are supported by a 
 large choir.                          
     In the graveyard there is an      
 Imperial War Graves Commission        
 graveyard for the New Zealand and     
 Canadian soldiers who died in         
 Brockenhurst hotels during the first  
 World War when they were used as      
 hospitals.  Each year on Anzac Day    
 there is a service attended by New    
 Zealand High Commission               
 representatives, the local British    
 Legion and villagers.
