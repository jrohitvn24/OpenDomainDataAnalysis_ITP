		<title>01THE HORNCASTLE AREA</title>
		<content>    The area contains all but a small  
 part of Horncastle, an historic town  
 which lies at the foot of the scenic  
 Lincolnshire Wolds.   The remainder of
 the Survey Block is composed of       
 undulating land curving down to the   
 open valley of the River Bain and its 
 small tributary, the Waring.          
                                       
    Horncastle dates back at least to  
 Roman times, when a wall enlosed some 
 7 acres.   Right from those times it  
 has acted as a local centre for the   
 surrounding farmlands, which are of   
 uniformly high quality.               
                                       
    It reached its greatest population 
 in 1851, when over 5000 people made a 
 living from trade and small           
 industries.   Today, there are 4200   
 inhabitants, many of whom now travel  
 outside the town to work.             </content>
