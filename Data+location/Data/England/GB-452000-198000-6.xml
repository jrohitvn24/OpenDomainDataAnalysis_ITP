		<content>In Nuneham Courtenay there are very few
Amenities: the Thread-Needle is an     
embroidery shop which sells all        
needlecraft supplies. It has been open 
since 1983. The Post office sells      
general groceries, fresh fruit and     
vegetables, soft drinks and spirits,   
newspapers and confectionery, as well  
as dairy products and bread etc.       
Further down the road is a metalworks  
and forge for all iron and steel work. 
The Nurseries, (open 9 years), used to 
be the kitchen gardens  of Nuneham     
house; in the grounds there is a big   
Â£Victorian Tea Room.' At the top of the
hill is a petrol filling station which 
sells all motoring requisites and      
refreshments. They also sell and hire  
out cars. The  Cobblers mend and sell  
shoes. There is a small playing field  
with a couple of swings for children,  
and an Inn, The Harcourt Arms.         </content>
