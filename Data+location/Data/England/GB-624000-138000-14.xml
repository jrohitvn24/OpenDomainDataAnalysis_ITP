		<title>14HOCKLEY SOLE</title>
		<content>   Hockley Sole is a mile westwards of 
 St. Mary's Church.It is a large Tudor 
 manor house set in beautiful grounds  
 with many fine specimen trees such as 
 enormous copper beeches,pines, oaks   
 and redwoods.These were planted in the
 1920's by the Raphael_Tucks of        
 postcards and greetings cards fame.   
 Until they bought Hockley Sole in 1914
 it had been used mostly as a farm.They
 improved tremendously both the house  
 and the grounds. The next owners added
 a large swimming pool.When we visited 
 the house we saw the beautiful library
 with two windows five metres tall and 
 the spiral staircase which leads to   
 the master bedroom.Everywhere there is
 oak panelling and we counted 37       
 chimneys!                             
    This area was once known as Hockley
 Hole and was supposed to have been    
 used by smugglers.                    </content>
