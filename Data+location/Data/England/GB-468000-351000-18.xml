		<content>{ Halloughton}is an old village.There  
 has been a settlement there since     
{Saxon times.}Also since Saxon times   
 the village has been{associated       
 with{Southwell Minster.}The church    
 at{Halloughton}was not built in Saxon 
 times. It was rebuilt in 1879 by Ewan 
 Christian.                            
   When the village had first been     
 found there were only{six}to{twelve   
{houses}and not many people lived      
 there.                                
  It is still a very small village.    
 There are{three farms}in{Halloughton  
 and{twenty-five houses.}The largest   
 farm is called Manor Farm. There are  
 no shops or pubs in{Halloughton}so it 
 is a very quiet place to live.
