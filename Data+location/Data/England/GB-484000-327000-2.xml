		<title>02FARMING in King Lud's area.</title>
		<content> The limestone bedrock occurs at a     
 shallow depth below the surface       
 resulting in a light stony soil over  
 much of the area.This has resulted in 
 the area being used for dairy as well 
 as arable farming.The greater part of 
 the farmland is however arable.       
 Although the modern trend to remove   
 hedges between fields in order to make
 much larger ones is very noticeable,  
 the relatively high and exposed nature
 of the terrain has resulted in        
 barriers of trees being left and the  
 hedges which remain being well cared  
 for.                                  
 Most of the area is divided between   
 two large estates, Belvoir Estate in  
 the north and Buckminster Trust Estate
 in the south. The result is an area of
 modern farming methods and efficiency.
