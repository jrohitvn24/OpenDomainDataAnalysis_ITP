 The Old Hall is a 15th century manor  
 house.It was built in the first half  
 of the 15th century by Sir Thomas     
 Burgh . In 1470 the house was partly  
 destroyed by the Lancastrians during  
 the wars of the Roses.Sir William     
 added the East wing between 1597 and  
 1600. The last of Hickmans was Dame   
 Frances Hickman who died unmarried in 
 1826 .The manor was bequeathed to a   
 nephew Henry Bacon who became Henry   
 Hickman Bacon Esq.The last lord of    
 the manor to die in Gainsborough was  
 Sir Hickman Beckett Bacon,premier
