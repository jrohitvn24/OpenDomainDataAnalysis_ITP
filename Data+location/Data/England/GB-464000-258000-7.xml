		<content>The Heyford village newspaper is called
The Prattler. It is printed monthly.   
The price of The Prattler is 8 pence;  
it was 6 pence when it started in 1977.
On the first page of the June 1985     
issue is an article called {The Old Sun
shines in Nether Heyford}. This pub has
had alterations done to it and they    
were officially opened on 22nd April   
1985 (see page 14). There is also an   
article on the {Heyford Hornets} (see  
page 10). The Prattler has 8 pages with
about two items on each page.          
Each month, as well as special items,  
there there are reports from the       
village clubs, the church, the         
chapel, the monthly Parish Council     
Meeting and a diary of forthcoming     
events. There is also, normally, a     
recipe from a village resident -       
June's recipe is for Caramel Nut Cake.
