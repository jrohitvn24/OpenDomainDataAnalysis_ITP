		<content> The most commonly used material is    
 natural stone which comes from a      
 Quarry near by at Much Wenlock{.There 
{are a lot of old timber framed houses.
 Some houses are built with red bricks 
 and mortar. Most of the roofs are     
 covered in clay tiles . Old windows   
 are often leaded light windows .      
 Guttering is mostly metal. Quite a few
 houses are rendered.{Modern buildings 
 have plastic guttering, and concrete  
 or clay tiles. They are very often    
 rendered bricks. Less wood is used in 
 their construction and more concrete. 
 Sometimes extensions or whole{new     
{buildings}are built with stone in the 
 traditional way . Farm buildings, out 
 houses and village halls are built    
 with cheaper materials like corrugated
 steel or asbestos, timber, roofing    
 felt and breeze blocks.
