		<content> The area is policed by two counties   
 and two divisions, 'K' division       
 (Sandwell) and 'J' division (Dudley). 
 Old Hill (Sandwell) is the only police
 station in the block, and it also     
 houses the only law court.  Forty to  
 fifty officers work from this station 
 of which ten are on duty at any one   
 time.  'J' division works from the    
 Dudley headquarters in the town       
 centre at any one time there are      
 usually four police officers on the   
 beat, two panda cars, two quick       
 response cars (zulu), and two dog     
 handlers covering the area and beyond.
 This is a busy area to police and     
 there are many small towns with busy  
 main roads. The most common crime is  
 theft followed by criminal damage.    
 there are several court sittings each 
 week, including domestic, magistrates 
 and juvenile courts.                  </content>
