		<title>14GENERAL LANDSCAPE,TREVERVA</title>
		<content> The general landscape is made up of   
 hills,narrow bendy roads and several  
 quarries,also there are 4 farms       
 spaced out unevenly.The farmland is   
 mainly rough grazing land.From one of 
 the highest points we could see       
 several miles around us including the 
 radar dishes at Goonhilly Downs.      
   All of the quarries we saw are      
 derelict.In our grid squares there is 
 a certain amount of woodland          
 consisting mainly of dense fir        
 trees.Wasteland and derelict land is  
 made up of disused quarries and       
 different types of ferns and bracken. 
 Nearly all of the land consists of    
 fields and the roads are narrow and   
 winding.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
