		<title>14LIFE-SAVING DEMONSTRATION</title>
		<content> AFTER THE SCHOOL SWIMMING GALA THE    
 LIFE-SAVERS TOOK PART IN A            
 DEMONSTRATION.IWAS ONE OF THEM.       
 WE HAD TO DEMONSTRATE SEVERAL WAYS OF 
 RESCUING SOMEONE.                     
 THE SCENE WAS SET AT THE EDGE OF A    
 RIVER WHERE FOUR CHILDREN WERE PLAYING
 ON A LI-LO IN THE MIDDLE OF A RIVER.  
 SOMEONE ACCIDENTLY LET IT DOWN.WHEN   
 THEY REALISED THIS THEY BEGAN TO      
 STRUGGLE.                             
 I SWAM OUT WITH A BALL THAT I WAS     
 PLAYING WITH,THREW IT TO ONE OF THE   
 CHILDREN AND TOLD THEM TO KICK THEIR  
 LEGS WHILE HOLDING ONTO THE BALL.AT   
 THE SAME TIME SOMEONE ELSE THREW A    
 ROPE AND HAULED IN ANOTHER CHILD WHILE
 TWO OTHERS WERE TOWED IN BY OTHER     
 RESCUERS.WE THEN HAD TO DEMONSTRATE   
 RESCUSITATION METHODS ON ONE OF THE   
 RESCUED CHILDREN.                     
                                       </content>
