		<title>16COUNTY TOWN</title>
		<content> As the county town of{HERTFORDSHIRE,  
 Hertford contains County Hall which is
 an imposing building to the south of  
 the town centre.This is the centre of 
 administration and employs a large    
 proportion of local people.The County 
 Council recently became "hung" as the 
 conservatives lost their overall      
 control owing to the Alliance Parties 
 winning many seats.The town also      
 contains the County Library which is  
 near to County Hall.However,because   
 the town is not by any means the      
 largest in the County there are not   
 many other important buildings in the 
 centre.Only the{CASTLE HALL}offers    
 regular entertainment-plays,films and 
 exbititions feature there.
