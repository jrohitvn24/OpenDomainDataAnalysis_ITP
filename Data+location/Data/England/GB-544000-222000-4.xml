 The old mound lies to the north of the
 School and was the site of an ancient 
 settlement. There is a wide variety of
 wild plants due to the lack of        
 disturbance by agriculture. These     
 include flowers such as Tormentil,    
 Tufted Vetch, Cowslips, Bluebells,    
 Daffodils and Germander Speedwell.    
 Other ground flora include Meadow,    
 Timothy, Cocksfoot, Couch, and Rye    
 Grass as well as Meadow Foxtail and   
 Spring Sedge.                         
 There are also a number of different  
 trees including two Silver Birch, a   
 very young Oak and a mature Plane.    
 There are a number of fallen  and cut 
 logs which provide a suitable habitat 
 for toadstools such as Psalliota      
 Semota. These have grown to 5-10      
 cms.This survey was carried out by    
 Justin Whitthread in form 1H.         </content>
