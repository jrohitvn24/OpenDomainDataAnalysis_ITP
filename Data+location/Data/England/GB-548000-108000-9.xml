		<content>      The area has two Church of       
 England churches and one Rector who   
 has a large parish with one other     
 church in nearby Laughton to care for.
      At one time each little village  
 had its own resident vicar but all    
 that has changed in the last fifty    
 years. In 1938 the parishes of        
 Chalvington and Ripe were joined. Then
 as recently as 1978 the village of    
 Laughton was added and our present    
 Rector has a widespread parish        
 including services held in the three  
 villages and Deanland Wood Caravan    
 Park. Services are held at 8.0am Holy 
 Communion, 11 am Matins and Holy      
 Communion and 6.30pm Evensong. Sunday 
 School is held on alternate Sundays   
 for the little children.              
      Bible reading fellowship is held 
 in the home of a church member. The   
 other sects go to Eastbourne.         </content>
