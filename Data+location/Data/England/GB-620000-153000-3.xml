		<title>03Adisham Farming, types</title>
		<content>  The farming pattern at Adisham has   
scarcely changed since the monks of    
Christ Church Canterbury grew corn     
and ran sheep over the Downs.          
There are now four farms in the area,  
two corn growing of six to seven       
hundred acres and two dairy farms,     
one of l30 acres with 100 cows and     
the other 240 acres with 80 milking    
cows, 65 followers and 40 sheep. Both  
of these use mechanical milking and    
the milk is collected by the Milk      
Marketing Board for distribution.      
The chief land-owners are the Church   
Commissioners and a Lord resident in   
an adjacent village, who has increased 
his estate by absorbing smaller farms. 
The corn lands were formerly fenced    
but now remain open fields of 50 to    
100 acres for easy working by tractor  
and combine harvester. Some other      
mixed farms penetrate the perimeter.   </content>
