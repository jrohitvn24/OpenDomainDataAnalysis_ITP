		<content> A Parents' Association had been under 
 discussion for some years.  In view of
 educational cut backs it was thought  
 that such an association might give   
 support and raise funds for extra     
 facilities.  The Headteacher and staff
 were in agreement.  A committee was   
 formed.  The first project            
 commissioned was an adventure         
 playground.  The first money making   
 venture was a Sports Barbeque         
 evening-a financial and a social      
 success.  A large donation from the   
 local Vintage Car Rally, Bingo &amp; Disco
 evenings produced more revenue.  More 
 than Â£6OO was raised.  By July 1985   
 the first part of the adventure       
 playground was finished and being     
 enjoyed by the children.  We have     
 subsidised school milk and run a      
 cycling proficiency course.
