		<title>15The Scout Barbeque</title>
		<content>                                       
In our village, Grimsargh, we have a   
lot of annual events such as HalloweÂ£en
parties,big bonfires,a school garden   
party and lots more.But this year the  
cubs and scouts had a barbeque.It was  
held at the beginning of June.There    
were posters up in the Post Office and 
garage.                                
It started at 8.00p.m. and finished at 
1.00a.m.There was a bar just for       
adults,and there was a sweet and drinks
stall.There was a game for             
children,where you had to hook a skewer
out of a bottle and then you won a     
lolly.For adults to eat there was      
chicken,a jacket potato and salad,and  
for children there was a beef burger,a 
sausage and salad.But best of all there
was"Black Knights Disco"with lots of   
records and flashing lights.Everyone   
came and it was a great success.       </content>
