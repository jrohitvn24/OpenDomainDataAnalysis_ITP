		<title>17LITTLE CANFIELD, THE CHURCH</title>
		<content> 1985 is a crisis year for this very   
 pretty but isolated little church.    
 Routine building work has revealed    
 that the church is unsafe for use.  It
 is estimated that Â£35,000 will be     
 needed to make the church safe.  At   
 present, services have to be held in  
 the village hall, the congregation has
 fallen to a handful of people.  The   
 question has been asked, should the   
 church be made redundant or do we owe 
 it to future generations to keep      
 historic buildings like this in good  
 repair.  Meetings have been held and  
 the villagers of Little Canfield have 
 decided to try to raise the money     
 needed.  They are hoping to attract   
 donations from individuals and from   
 industry and to organise a grand prize
 draw.  It would be sad if the Church  
 Of All Saints Little Canfield only    
 from one Domesday to die at the next. </content>
