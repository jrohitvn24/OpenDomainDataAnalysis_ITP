		<content> FAVERSHAM CREEK winds for 5 kms from  
the Swale to the heart of the town but 
it is no longer the main artery of     
trade.Costing the town 10,000 pounds   
p.a.it does gain from the Hatch        
charity.6,000 pounds was granted for   
dredging to improve the turning point  
below Pauls &amp; 2,500 pounds for a new   
jetty at the town green.Commercial     
shipping has declined from 40 per month
when Shellmex operated until 1970 to   
approx 1 vessel every 2 months.Silting 
is a problem.Vessel movements have to  
be on the highest spring tides but,even
then stranding occurs.Faversham's      
problem is that fewer vessels means    
more silting and more silting means    
fewer ships.Many who are closely       
 nvolved with the creek sucH as

operator and A.Reekie at iron wharf    
feel that any future will lie with     </content>
