		<title>01Mow Cop Castle</title>
		<content>  Mow Cop castle was built on a ridge  
overlooking the surrounding            
countryside.It used to have a wall, a  
roof and a floor,all that remains      
now is a ruined wall and a stone built 
tower,which has three windows.         
  The summer house was built in 1754   
by the Wilbrahams who paid the Hardings
to build it.Nobody is sure why it was  
built.Some people say it was built for 
people to enjoy,others say it is a     
folly.In 1850 there was a court case   
about the Wilbrahams and the Sneyds,   
about who owned. It was built on the   
border of Cheshire and Staffordshire.  
It was eventually decided that the     
Wilbrahams owned it. The summer house  
was given to the National Trust in     
1937.
