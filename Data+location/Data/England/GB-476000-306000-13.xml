{   ___________________________        
    Owston is a conservation village   
 and there is no permission for any new
 houses. Existing buildings are subject
 to planning restrictions from the     
 local authority for any extensions.   
 The Priory, adjacent to the church, is
 on Norman foundations and might have  
 been the monastery hospital. It has a 
 sundial dated{1319}and two fifteenth  
 century doorways, but was mainly      
 rebuilt in the seventeenth century.   
 Stone from the abbey is evident in the
 village and there are several listed  
 buildings including one Georgain house
 and one house has its windows blocked 
 as a result of window tax. There are  
 only three post-war houses, two of    
 which are council owned, Otherwise    
 everyone owns their own home. All old 
 cottages are now modernised.          </content>
