		<content>      My Home.                         
  I live in a modern house made of     
 brick and tile.  I have got a         
 television and  a radio which work by 
 electricity. We have a freezer which  
 keeps food frozen, and a refrigerator 
 which keeps food cool. We have got a  
 piano and a computer. We have a       
 modern bathroom with a bath, a        
 handbasin and a toilet.               
   We have a dining room, a breakfast  
 room and four bedrooms.  One of the   
 bedrooms is my own.                   
   We have a lounge where we can sit in
 front of a fireplace in which we can  
 burn wood and coal.                   
   We have a big garden and a pet dog. 
   I have one brother. Dad and Mum each
 have a car to go to work and the      
 shops.      ROBERT WILLIAMS AGE 9.
