		<content> The most prominent feature of this    
 D-block is the township of Tadcaster, 
 standing abreast the lower reaches of 
 the River Wharfe at the point at which
 the old Roman road from Pontefract to 
 York crosses it.                      
 It has a{population}of approximately  
 10 000 people who mainly find{        
{employment}in the{brewing}industry.   
 The remainder of the block is         
 predominently arable{farm}land with   
 the exception of two areas occupied   
 by the village of Stutton and by      
 Tadcaster Grammar School.             
 Crossing the block from West to East  
 is the dual carriageway of the by-pass
 carrying the A64 from Leeds to York   
 and on to Scarborough.
