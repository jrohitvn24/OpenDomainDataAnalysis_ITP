		<title>09COATES: A FENLAND VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Coates is a village of some 800       
 inhabitants situated 12 miles from the
 City of Peterborough. It is entirely  
 surrounded by a flat sea of arable    
 farm land.                            
    The village is built around a      
 village green which has been cut in   
 half by the A605 road. Some of the    
 older houses are thatched, and all are
 built of local brick.                 
    The village has 2 pubs, a village  
 shop, a post office, a garage, a      
 used car showroom, a pet shop and an  
 agricultural engineers.               
    10 years ago 100 new houses were   
 built in a small estate. These have   
 been brought by newcomers to the area.
    A Parish church, a Methodist       
 Chapel, and a village hall complete   
 the amenities. The Primary school     
 caters for children from 4 to 11      
 years, of which there are about 140.  </content>
