		<title>15CHRISTCHURCH SURVEY</title>
		<content> A few days ago we went into           
 Christchurch and interviewed some     
 people this is what we found out.     
 Most people of all ages liked         
 Christchurch.They liked it because it 
 was small and easy to get around.     
 Everyone liked the new improvements   
 and found them a great help to        
 shopping. Some people ,especially the 
 people who were over 60,thought that  
 the younger generation were more      
 violent than their generation because 
 there is less order in homes.The price
 of food has gone up a lot in the last 
 10/15 years and there is a lot more   
 tinned food. Transport has changed    
 quite a bit and there is now a lot    
 more private transport than 10 years  
 ago.Most older people's favourite     
 pastime is reading and the middle aged
 people liked sport.People under 20    
 liked to do more adventurous things.  </content>
