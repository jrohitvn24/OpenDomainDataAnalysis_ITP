		<title>02BOURNE END COMMUNITY CENTRE</title>
		<content> A group of Bourne End citizens thought
that a community the size of ours      
should have a community centre.It took 
4 years to raise the money for the     
centre.In 1967 it was officially opened
by Lord Lieutenant,County of Buckingham
.It was built to provide a place to    
bring people together,also to discuss  
the community's welfare.The centre is  
used for 81 different activities,      
including amateur dramatics and        
horticulture.The Bar area is used for  
any committee meetings.A Creche,also   
held in the bar,needs better facilities
.The centre is troubled by vandals to  
a certain extent,but not seriously.    
The Community Centre warden organizes  
an annual carnival week of multi-activ 
ities with a procession,sideshows and  
fete.
