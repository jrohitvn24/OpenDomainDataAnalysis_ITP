		<title>09THE NEW HOSPITAL COMPLEX</title>
		<content> I live in the Monks Road area and my  
 back garden overlooks the new County  
 Hospital complex.  The original site  
 of the hospital, built in 1769, was on
 Waterside South, moving to the present
 site on Sewell Road in 1876.  The     
 development of Phase I (east of the   
 present hospital) commenced in 1981 at
 a cost of Â£16.7 million. It was opened
 on the 23rd July 1985 by the Princess 
 of Wales.  There are two blocks, two  
 stories high consisting of four wards,
 four operating theatres and various   
 departments in one block, and the out-
 patients department in the other.     
 There are 625 rooms, 30 miles of pipe 
 work, 2000 miles of electric cable in 
 this wing.                            
 In all, 3 phases are planned, with    
 completion due in the 1990's.
