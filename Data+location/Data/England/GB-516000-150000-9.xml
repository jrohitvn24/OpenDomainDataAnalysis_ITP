		<content>   There is an area on the top of      
 Box Hill where there are{six permanent
{caravan sites}.One of them has 106    
 caravans(or mobile homes or units) all
 of which are connected to{main        
{drainage and electricity}.They are    
 centrally heated.                     
   The units are like flat bungalows   
 with{small gardens}which were mostly  
 very well looked after.There was 20   
 foot between each caravan for         
 safety.Car parking spaces are also    
 provided.{Retired people,families and 
{young people}live on the site.        
   Cats,mice and parrots are allowed   
 but no dogs.                          
   We met the{manager}in the office,   
 which was not very organised.He       
 was a cheerful,unshaven,humorous      
 man,dressed in a T_shirt and flared   
 trousers. His wife wore carpet        
 slippers.                             </content>
