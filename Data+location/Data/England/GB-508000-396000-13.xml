		<content>         Holton Hall                   
 Holton Hallhas belonged to the Dixons 
 and their family since 1741.Then the  
 total of 700 acres was bought for     
 Â£680.Additional land was purchased    
 through the years and at one time     
 amounted to 2800 acres,some of which  
 was let.Today they farm 1400 acreswith
 a mixture of cereal,araable and       
 parkland and they employ 9 men.There  
 are 4 tenanted farms.In 1970 the whole
 village was owned by the family.We    
 have sold 4 houses and we have sold 10
 building plots to increase the size of
 the village.They still have about 55  
 houses to look after.It is interesting
 to note that in the early 1800's the  
 estate was all farmed by the family,by
 1900 it was all let to tenants and now
 more is being farmed by the           
 family.This is a reflection of social 
 and economic changes.                 </content>
