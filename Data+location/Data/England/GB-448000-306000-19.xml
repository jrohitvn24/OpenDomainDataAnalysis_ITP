		<content>                                       
    An interview with Mr.Brooks,who    
 farms at Old Hayes Farm,near Ratby.   
{How much land do you farm?            
 On this farm I've got about 150 acres.
{How many animals have you got?        
 110 Beef Cattle,1 Bull,21 Cows,500    
 sheep and lots of chickens.Some of the
 cattle are sent abroad to places like 
 Iraq,India and Holland.               
{What are some of the problems of      
{keeping sheep?                        
 At lambing time some of the ewes die  
 and others can't give enough milk.    
 Wherever possible we try to get       
 another ewe to take them on or they   
 have to be fed from a bucket with     
 teats.                                
{Do you grow any crops?}               
 I grow barley for animal feed and     
 wheat which will be sent to the mill  
 to be made into flour for bread.      </content>
