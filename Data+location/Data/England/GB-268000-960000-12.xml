		<title>12DRYING PEATS</title>
		<content> Sometimes the thrower can't put all   
 the peats on the spread and then he   
 has to build a wall with the blocks.  
 This wall is called "the bar" and     
 there have to be large air holes in it
 so that the peats can dry.            
{STORROWING PEATS:} Three weeks after  
 cutting the peats are ready to be     
 storrowed - that is placed on end in  
 little wigwam like piles so that the  
 air can circulate freely round them.  
 In a wet year those piles sometimes   
 have to be taken down and built up    
 again, outside in.  This is known as  
 "astorrowing" and no one does it if   
 they can help it.  After another three
 weeks the peats should be ready to    
 come home.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
