		<content> A small and wooded knoll rises up out 
 of the small village of Compton       
 Dundon. At the top of a narrow        
 untrodden path, is a large clearing   
 with many paths leading into it. Many 
 centuries ago this clearing was full  
 of life. An enormous Iron_Age fort    
 stood there about 800 years ago.      
 Surrounding the large plateau which   
 lies some 250 feet above the          
 countryside is a seven foot ditch. At 
 the other end of the knoll lies a 12  
 foot high 'beacon' from which most of 
 the surrounding countryside can be    
 seen. Unfortunately most of the       
 archaeological remains of this fort   
 are enveloped in undergrowth. Another 
 defence of this fort was that it had a
 stone wall some 7 feet high, that     
 encompassed the whole of the top of   
 the hill. As most other forts in this 
 area,Dundon has gone to wrack and ruin</content>
