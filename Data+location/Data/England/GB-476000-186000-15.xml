		<title>15Reactions to Filming.</title>
		<content>Hambleden village has been used        
frequently for filming.When we went to 
the village,we asked people's opinions 
of the filming.Most people said that   
they did not mind the film crews coming
so long as they tidied up afterwards   
and did not take over the village.     
  The shopkeeper said that it brought  
new faces to the village. One person   
said that it stopped the traffic too   
much and her husband could not get to  
work on time. The policeman said that  
he liked it and it had to be done.     
  The school children enjoyed it very  
much and hoped it did not stop people  
doing what they wanted.                
  A lot of people enjoyed watching the 
actors and camera men and looked       
forward to watching the serial on the  
television.
