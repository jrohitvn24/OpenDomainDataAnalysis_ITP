		<content>On the 14th June 1985 the orchestra and
choir of our school went to the Church 
of the Holy Sepulchre to perform in    
front of the Earl and Countess         
Spencer.When we entered we saw a       
beautiful display of flowers and life  
size models of soldiers.We saw stained 
glass windows showing a battle.In the  
windows were wreaths for the Royal     
Marines,Royal Navy,Royal Army,and Royal
Air Force.We saw a propeller from one  
of the war planes.We saw guests        
arriving and microphones for BBC Radio 
Northampton being put up.Our picture   
was taken for the Chronicle &amp; Echo     
local newspaper.We sang and the        
orchestra played and afterwards Earl   
Spencer thanked us.We arrived back at  
school at 12.45pm.-This Round church is
a reproduction of the original Church  
in Jerusalem and the largest of only   
four in England,founded in 1100 AD.    </content>
