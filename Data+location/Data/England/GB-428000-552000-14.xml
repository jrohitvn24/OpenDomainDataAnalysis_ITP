  Last{Saturday}when I woke up I got   
 ready and went to the bathroom to get 
 washed and clean my teeth.I woke my   
 brother,went downstairs,got my break- 
 fast and switched on the TV.At 9.00   
 a.m.I got my coat and my dancing case 
 and went down the church bank and     
 through the tunnel.Past Fatfield      
 School I crossed the road to the      
{Welfare Hall}and went inside.Pat,my   
 dancing teacher,told me to do my Cha  
 Cha Cha to the Ghost Buster's tune.I  
 had to dance it through twice and then
 do my Samba twice.Then the older group
 did their Samba twice and we did my   
 teacher's Samba.I went home at half   
 past eleven, got my dinner and went   
 out to play. After what seemed like   
 only 5 minutes I had to go for tea.At 
 the end of the day I had a bath,got my
 supper and went to bed.               </content>
