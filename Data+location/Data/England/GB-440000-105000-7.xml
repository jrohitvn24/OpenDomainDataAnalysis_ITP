		<content> FOOTBALL ON THE MUD was first played  
 between Marchwood Flounders and Hythe 
 Eels in 1905 on the mudfflats to the  
 north od Hythe Pier, where competitors
 endured 15 minutes each way of        
 wallowing up to waist deep in the mud.
 By selling programmes at 1d. each they
 raised much needed funds for Hythe    
 Hospital.  In 1983 the Hythe &amp;        
 District Rotaract Club were made      
 custodians of the Mudlarks Challenge  
 Cup. Up until the early 1970's the    
 match was contested by teams from the 
 local Fire Services at its present    
 site behind the Post Office, and after
 a few years of inactivity, the custom 
 was resurrected in 1978 by the        
 Rotaract Club. HYTHE PRIMARY SCHOOL   
 CENTENARY - everybody had to dress up 
 in old-fashioned clothes. Dress ranged
 through Victorian, Charleston, punk   
 to modern dress. This was in 1983.    </content>
