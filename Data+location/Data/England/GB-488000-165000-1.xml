		<content>   The area in{Berkshire}allotted to   
 our group is mainly mixed forest land 
 crossed by two main roads, Swinley    
 Road (A332) Ascot to Bagshot and the  
 Bagshot Road (322) Bracknell to       
 Bagshot.                              
                                       
   Much of the{forest land}belongs to  
 the{Crown Estates}and has two main    
 uses:{forestry}and{recreation.} The   
 former is carried out at the Swinley  
 Sawmill (A332) and the latter at the  
 Swinley Forest Golf Course.           
                                       
   The North-West of our region        
 includes some of the newer parts of   
{Bracknell New Town,}the{neighbourhoods
 of{Harmans Water}and{Crown Wood.} In  
 the North-East of it there is a small 
 part of{South Ascot;}a{housing estate}
 built in the 1950's and some private  
 housing  which has been added since.  </content>
