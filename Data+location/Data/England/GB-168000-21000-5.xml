 In our D.Block there are lots of      
 disused quarries but today there is   
 only one working and that is          
{Trevassack quarry.}                   
 The stone which was quarryied in the  
 disued quarries was used for making   
 hedges ,farm buildings,and for        
 building stone houses.                
 The quarry is about one hundred years 
 old and produces{serpentine}and blue }
 elvan.Today's products are used mainly
 for{road building}but some stone is   
 used for{sculpturing .}               
 The process is to drill  deep         
 holes into the stone and using        
 dynamite, blast large quantities of   
 stone ready for crushing to the right 
 size and selling to local companies.  
 Quarring is eating into the           
 surrounding{heathland}and destroying  
{rare plants}and{flowers.}             </content>
