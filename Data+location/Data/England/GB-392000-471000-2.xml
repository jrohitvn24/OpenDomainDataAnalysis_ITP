		<content>   Arncliffe lies in the valley bottom 
 where Cowside Beck joins the River    
 Skirfare.  All the buildings are of   
 local stone, and blend naturally with 
 the surrounding scenery.              
   Twenty-seven of the houses are      
 permanently occupied, eight are       
 unoccupied for long periods, and one  
 is derelict.                          
   The village has its own church,     
 school and village hall, and these    
 serve the rest of the dale as well.   
   In the centre of the large village  
 green is an old water pump which,     
 seventy years ago, supplied the       
 cottages in the village, now the      
 village supply comes from the nearby  
 hill.                                 
   There is an inn, a hotel, a post    
 office and a grocery shop, and three  
 travelling shops come to the village, 
 a green grocer, a grocer, and butcher.</content>
