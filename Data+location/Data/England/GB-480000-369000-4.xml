		<title>04High Marnham Power Station</title>
		<content> High Marnham Power Station was the    
 first one to built in this country    
 with an output of 1000 MWs which was  
 enough electricity to meet the needs  
 of 1,000,000 people.Work began on     
 building in November 1955 and the     
 first electricity was produced in     
 1959.The station was completed in 1962
 at a cost of Â£50million.It is sited in
 the ideal spot to use coal from the   
 East Midlands Coalfield and on the    
 bank of the Trent which provides water
 for the cooling system.Although some  
 agricultural land was lost in the     
 building of the station,a much larger 
 area has been returned to agriculture 
 by filling in derelict gravel pitswith
 waste ash which is piped 5 miles      
 across the Trent.A suspension foot    
 bridge has been built to enable       
 workers to gain easy access to the    
 Station from the east of the Trent.   </content>
