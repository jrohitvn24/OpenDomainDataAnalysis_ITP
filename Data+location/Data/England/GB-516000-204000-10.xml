		<title>10The Herts Advertiser</title>
		<content>{The Herts Advertiser}is a local paper.
 The premises are just down the road in
 our project area so it is quite       
 important.                            
 The newspaper was started by{Alderman 
{Richard Gibbs}after stamp tax was     
 abolished in{1885.}It is a weekly     
 paper published on{Fridays}and costs  
{14p.}Nowadays it sells{21,000 copies  
 on average a week. There are{24 full  
{time journalists and 2 part time.     
 There are{30 people in St. Albans     
 involved in{printing}and{15 in Luton. 
 It only takes one hour to print all   
 the copies, with modern printing      
 technology. I interviewed{Mr.         
{Richardson, the Editor;}he thinks it  
 is a very good paper. The paper has to
 be good to compete with several free  
 newspapers distributed in the St.     
 Albans area.
