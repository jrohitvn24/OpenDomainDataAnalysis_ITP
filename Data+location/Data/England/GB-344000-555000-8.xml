		<content> Our survey showed that most adults in 
 this area work in Carlisle.The majoity
 of women work at home ,as housewifes  
 but quite  a lot have partime         
 jobs.Many younger adults are          
 unemployed or are on a Youth          
 Employment Schemes.Although there is a
 shortage of jobs,there does not seem  
 to be the enormously high unemployment
 here as we understand there is in many
 cities.As well as working in offices, 
 factories,shops,Civic Centre,etc.there
 are people who run small businesses   
 such as garages,shops,lorry           
 drivers,old folks homes,farms,etc.    
   There is not much primary industry  
 here. The area serves as a dormitory  
 for Carlisle.
