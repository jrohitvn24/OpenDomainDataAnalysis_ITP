		<title>14HOUSING IN TILSTON</title>
		<content> Most of the housing in our area are   
 found in the village of Tilston or    
 around Carden Green. There are three  
 small estates; Inveresk Road, Rookery 
 Road and Grafton Park. Rookery Road is
 council property but the majority of  
 housing in our area is privately      
 owned. The size of property ranges    
 from small cottages to large mansions.
 The larger property is the older      
 property and some date back to        
 Elizabethan times. There are many     
 large farm houses in our area and they
 mostly date back to the 19th century. 
 Many of the older people live in      
 bungalows. Most people look after     
 their houses and we have no neglected 
 property in our area. This is an area 
 where people desire to live. The      
 terrace houses are pre-war. Many of   
 the large houses are set in beautiful 
 gardens.                              </content>
