		<content>  The area is sparsely populated       
 overall.The main A10 Trunk Road (     
 formerly Ermine St. - an old Roman    
 Road ),connecting London and          
 Cambridge,runs through the western    
 edge of the block.The River Rib       
 meanders its way towards the Lea      
 Valley through the eastern part of the
 block.Most of the land is farmed -    
 arable crops mainly.An independant    
 school - St. Edmund's College - is in 
 the NW corner of the block.The main   
 settlement is Colliers End , a linear 
 development on the A10.There are two  
 small villages - Barwick and Latchford
 - connected to the A10 by a minor     
 road,whose inhabitants are either     
 involved in farming or local industry.
 These villages provide some of the    
 essential services for the community  
 like the church,butcher,pub and       
 garage.                               </content>
