		<content> At Dean Point, to the north of        
 Coverack, is the Dean Quarry. The     
 quarry provides various grades of     
 roadstone. It is the largest employer 
 in an area where unemployment is high.
 The stone is carried away by road and 
 also by ship. The small bulk-carrying 
 ship can often be seen tied up to a   
 small jetty near to the quarry, and it
 i loaded by conveyer belt, which      
 carries the stone out over the beach. 
 Recently application has been made to 
 extend the quarry, which has caused   
 some social concern in the            
 neighbouring area of the quarry. Local
 residents fear damage to their homes  
 from blasting. Public meeting have    
 been called to allow the people of the
 village of St. Keverne to voice their 
 opinion on the subject; and opinions  
 are varied according to interests:    
 whether resident or quarry employee.  </content>
