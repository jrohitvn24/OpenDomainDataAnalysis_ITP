		<title>17RURAL MEDICINE, ST.ALLEN.</title>
		<content> People in the area can register with  
 any of 4 medical practices,2 of which 
 are based in Truro &amp; 1 in each of the 
 villages of Chacewater &amp; Probus.There 
 are no branch surgeries in this area, 
 &amp; very little public transport,so     
 patients need their own transport to  
 attend a doctor's surgery.Emergencies 
 are dealt with by the doctor or       
 ambulance attending the patient.The   
 winding lanes make journeys relatively
 slow,&amp; this situation is much worse   
 when tourists are travelling the      
 single-track lanes in summer.Farm     
 machines at silage,hay,&amp; harvest times
 are another hazard which may seriously
 delay emergency vehicles.    Cornish  
 farming people are very stoical,&amp; do  
 not seek medical help usually until   
 they are unable to work.They tend to  
 be self-sufficient &amp; healthy people.
