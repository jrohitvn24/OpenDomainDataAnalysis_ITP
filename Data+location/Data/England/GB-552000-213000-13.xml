		<content> To save time and money, when they are 
 spraying the crops, they have a small 
 tank which they fill with chemicals   
 and its taken down to the fields and  
 pumped straight into the crop sprayer.
 Their crop spraying tractor was       
 covered in little things that looked  
 like sesame seeds - these were in fact
 corn petals.  The only disaster they  
 could recall was when they filled the 
 an old stable too high with grain and 
 the weight of it  pushed the stone    
 walls out.  They are on mains water   
 but during heavy demand they use water
 from a well.  The Forest Way goes     
 across their land.  There are various 
 deciduous trees such as oak, maple and
 chestnut and the hedges are mainly    
 hawthorn and small ash.  Wildlife on  
 the farm include foxes, hares,        
 rabbits, owls, pheasants, patridges   
 and wild ducks.                       </content>
