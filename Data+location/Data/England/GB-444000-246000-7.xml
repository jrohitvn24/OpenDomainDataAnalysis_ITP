		<title>07The Church</title>
		<content> The church is called St Mary the      
Virgin and in the north aisle in the   
second window there is a fragment of   
old glass which is the head of the     
Blessed Virgin Mary. The piece of glass
was found in the churchyard.There are  
also the remains of wall paintings,one 
is called the Doom painting ,it is     
thought that it was hidden during      
Puritan times.About the same time,on   
the eve of the Battle of Cropredy      
Bridge  the lectern was hidden in the  
River Cherwell.The beak of the eagle   
is open and may have been used to      
collect "Peter's Pence",a tax then     
paid to Rome.The coins were removed    
from a slot in the tail.Above the organ
there is a little window through which 
the priest could look into the church. 
 The church was built at different     
times,some of it dates from 1050.There 
ae 6 bells in the tower,and 2 fonts.   </content>
