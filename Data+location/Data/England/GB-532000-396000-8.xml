		<content>      THE EGG FARM                     
 There are about 333000 chickens on the
 egg farm.A very good layer will lay   
 about 520 eggs per year, but a normal 
 layer will lay round about 400 eggs   
 per year.A good layer should lay 10   
 eggs a week.There are about 14 sheds  
 altogether at the egg farm owned by   
 Keith &amp; Kath Coulling.If the owner is 
 away William Winship is in_charge of  
 the entire egg farm.When there is a   
 power cut, or something breaks down,  
 such as an incubator and the people   
 can't fix it quickly 100's of chickens
 die.But only if its off for a long    
 time. A few years ago there was a     
 disease called FOWL PEST which killed 
 hundreds of tiny chickens. Recently   
 two new hen houses have been built    
 on the farm which was first used      
 almost one hundred years ago.
