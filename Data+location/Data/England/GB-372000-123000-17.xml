		<title>17CHURCHES AND CHURCHYARDS</title>
		<content>  North Cheriton church was built in   
 1783.You can notice this by the       
 battlements on it's tower.            
  The church has very beautiful        
 stained glass windows which I thought 
 were gorgeous.                        
                                       
                                       
  The graves looked old and as if      
 nobody came to visit them.As you come 
 into the graveyard you had daffodils  
 going up one side of you.             
  On the opposite side of the road from
 the church stands a monument for the  
 men that died in world war one and    
 two.                                  
  I saw a large hole like a grave      
 covered with polythene.This was an old
 caved in tomb.                        
  Most of the gravestones were eroded  
 which was a pity as I was unable to   
 find any dates.                       </content>
