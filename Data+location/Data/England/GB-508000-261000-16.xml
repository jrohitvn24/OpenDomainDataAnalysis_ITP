		<title>16TRANSPORT IN L.STAUGHTON</title>
		<content> Most families in the village find they
 have to own at least one car to enable
 them to travel to work,make major     
 shopping purchases, or visit          
 professional entertainments.The rural 
{bus}service is very poor with only    
 five buses each weekday and none on   
 Sunday.These buses travel between     
 St.Neots and Bedford.The journey by   
 bus is much slower than by car and    
 takes approximately half an hour to   
 travel ten miles.For elderly people   
 and others without their own transport
 the{Womens Royal Voluntary Service    
 provides a car for essential journeys 
 to the doctor in Kimbolton.           
 The nearest{Railway Stations}are some 
 7-ll miles away at St. Neots,         
 Huntingdon and Bedford. Although the  
 nearest{airport}is at Luton, people   
 often fly fron the London airports at 
 Gatwick and Heathrow.                 </content>
