		<content> The  people of Colerne Village lead   
 busy and active lives. Some of them   
 work in the village but a considerable
 number work outside. In the increasing
 amount of leisure time we have today  
 there is a wide range of activities   
 for both young and old in the village.
 Here are some of the clubs for adults:
 Womens Institute, Skittles, Four      
 Football teams,One Rugby team,Tennis  
 courts,Two clubs, Singers, Luncheon   
 Club, Bell Ringing,Hand Bells and     
 Darts.                                
 There are also many clubs for         
 children, they include Cubs, Brownies,
 Guides, Scouts, Youth Club, Mustard   
 Seed and Pilots (two clubs organised  
 by the church), Swimming Club and     
 Gymnastics. Although people have to go
 into the nearby towns for some things,
 there are many amenities in the       
 village.                              </content>
