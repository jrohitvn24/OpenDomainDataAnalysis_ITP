		<content> There are more old houses in this     
 rural area than new ones, there are no
 post war houses in Alderley, Lower    
 Kilcott or Wortley, although many have
 been rennovated. In the area as a     
 whole 46% were built before 1800,     
 another 24% are pre 1900 and 24% are  
 post second world war. Most of the    
 older houses are detatched, as are    
 some newer properties. 54% of the     
 houses are detatched, 20% are semi-   
 detatched, 14% terraced and there are 
 a few odd bungalows and cottages. The 
 newer houses have mostly been built of
 stone to blend into their rural       
 setting. 66% of the houses are built  
 of stone, 16% are brick, 12% are both 
 brick and stone, whilst 6% are        
 concrete block, rendered. Most roofs  
 are tiled others are stone or slate.  
 Most houses are heated by coal and    
 wood, many use electricity and oil.   </content>
