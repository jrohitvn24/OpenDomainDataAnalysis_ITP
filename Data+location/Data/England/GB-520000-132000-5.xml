		<content> rutting season. Herds are culled to   
 maintain a healthy population.        
 Foxes,badgers, squirrel and rabbits   
 about along with mice, voles, shrews  
 etc plus occasional unwelcome mink.   
 Bats and adders have been seen too.   
 Butterfly population about usual for  
 aera of mixed woodlalnd.              
 Most of the surrounding farmland is   
 under grass with sheep and cattle     
 grazing and a few horses. Once the    
 ponds and streams supplied the local  
 people wit an important source of food
 fish and bird life were plentiful.    
 Pollution has reduced the fish        
 population. Some ponds dry out        
 in summer, and in others the aquatic  
 life is less than healthy. Good news  
 is that anglers have done a lot of    
 good work in tending the ponds, which 
 in turn improve plant, animal and fish
 life and birds too.                   </content>
