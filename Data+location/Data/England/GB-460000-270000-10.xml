		<title>10Vicar of Parish Church</title>

The life of the vicar is very varied.  
His work is split into two parts, to   
conduct worship and to care for the    
people of the parish. There is at the  
moment a shortage of vicars so Canon   
Staples is responsible for more than   
one parish. His day off is Monday and  
his busiest day of the week is         
Wednesday. He gets three weeks off     
every year and two or three days after 
Christmas and Easter. He has to prepare
services.                              
              The Church               
The church is cleaned by voluntary     
helpers. There are about a dozen bell  
ringers. A lot of tourists go to the   
church to see the old Norman font.
