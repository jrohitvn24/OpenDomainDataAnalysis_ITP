All Saints Church is built of stone    
and you can still see some sea shells  
in the stonework.                      
                                       
It was built about 1220 AD. The Mears  
Ashby Cross probably dates from        
somewhere near the year 1000 AD.       
                                       
The Tower dates around 1220, and hidden
behind the south clock face is a very  
simple Early English Lancet window.    
                                       
Last year expert restorers spent a long
time removing plaster from an ancient  
wall painting in the Church. This      
painting depicts HEAVEN and HELL and is
called a DOOM PAINTING.
