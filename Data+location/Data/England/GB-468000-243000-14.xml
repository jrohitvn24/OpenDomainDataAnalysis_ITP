		<title>14A Car Survey in Pury End</title>
		<content>                                       
There are about ninety houses in Pury  
End and when we did our survey we      
spoke to people in thirty-two of them. 
                                       
The most common car was the Ford       
Fiesta (cost around four thousand      
pounds) and the car which people would 
have if money was no object would be a 
Porshe (cost between fifteen thousand  
and seventy-four thousand pounds).     
There were three people who had        
four-wheel-drive vehicles. Twenty-nine 
had radios and twenty-one had cassette 
players in their cars. Most people     
seem to get a new car every five years 
or so and the average annual mileage   
of the participants in the survey was  
about twelve thousand.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
