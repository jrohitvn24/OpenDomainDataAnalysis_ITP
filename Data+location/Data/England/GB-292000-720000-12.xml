		<content> In this country area we have lots of  
 country sports such as, shooting      
 pheasants,partridges,hare,rabbits and 
 pigeons. There is clay-pigeon shooting
 as well. Some people go fishing or    
 riding. Also some farmers go curling. 
 One or two people canoe on the Pow    
 Water. A few people are keen on bird  
 watching. We know of one rally-driver.
 In winter some people go ski-ing in   
 the hills. Indoors they do some of    
 these things:_watch TV,listen to the  
 radio,knitting,sewing,reading,stamp_  
 collecting, carving on wood or horn.  
 In summer we do different things like 
 swimming,gardening,golfing,cycling,   
 jogging and going for walks and       
 picnics. Barbecues in the garden on   
 warm evenings are popular. So is      
 sunbathing,if the weather is good.
