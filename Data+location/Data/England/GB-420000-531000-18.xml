		<content> "We grow wheat &amp; barley, also potatoes
 &amp; turnips. Recently, oil seed rape. My
 wife helps with the lambs", said David
 Coote, a labourer on Whins Farm, thus 
 emphasizing the largely unchanged face
 of local farms, limited by the nature 
 of the soil. Here small fields abound;
 the many hedgerows of hawthorn &amp; dog- 
 rose, which together with the several 
 areas of woodland provide a much need-
 ed habitat for native flora &amp; fauna.  
 The mines have gone, &amp;their ugly slag-
 heaps, improving considerably the land
 scape since Mitton. The air is purer &amp;
 the vegetation taking on a more luxur-
 ious aspect. The rivers too, notwith- 
 standing the industry at Newfield, are
 less polluted. The Wear, restocked, is
 now fished by local angling clubs.    
 The villages, never pretty, are now   
 cleaner; more colourful (see slide 3).
 Man &amp; nature is benefiting from this. </content>
