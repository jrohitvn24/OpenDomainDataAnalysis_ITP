		<title>09A DAY IN THE LIFE OF MY MUM</title>
		<content>                                       
  My Mums day begins at some unearthly 
 time like 6:30am when she comes       
 downstairs and makes our breakfast.For
 me and my sister,she just puts out    
 cereal but for my dad she makes an    
 egg,toast and a pot of tea.Then at    
 8:15, she goes into Pannal where she  
 is a lollipop lady outside Pannal     
 school.She crosses the children whilst
 her stick tells the traffic to        
 wait.She gets home about 9:15.She then
 washes up,hoovers or dusts the house  
 and if she has time she might watch a 
 video or something.Then she will have 
 a snack lunch then begin to get tea   
 ready.We usually have mince,shepherds 
 pie or pizza.When I come in,after     
 walking home,my tea is nearly ready,  
 I sit in front of the T.V.and eat my  
 tea.My mum also watches T.V.,she likes
 soap operas and mysteries best.       </content>
