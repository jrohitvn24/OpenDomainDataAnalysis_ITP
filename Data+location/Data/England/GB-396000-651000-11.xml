		<content> Until recently,there were many more   
 rented Council houses than privately  
 owned properties.More people are now  
 wishing to purchase their own home.   
 Along the banks of the Tweed 20 years 
 ago about 25% was built-up area. The  
 figure now is about 42%.The farming   
 land has not changed much except where
 it has been taken for building sites. 
 The styles of private and Council     
 housing are broadly similar.Most are  
 semi-detached with a kitchen, bathroom
 with toilet, three bedrooms and either
 separate sitting and dining rooms or, 
 more recently, a combined sitting and 
 dining area.The gardens are generally 
 small.Over half of the houses have a  
 garage.Many of the recently-built     
 Council houses have adjacent garage   
 space.The estates are served by       
 regular bus routes;the railway station
 is often beyond walking distance.     </content>
