		<content>     The Isle of Thanet derives it's   
name from having been divided from the 
mainland of Kent by the Wansum - or    
Wantsum - Channel in times past. The   
Romans and Vikings both used it as a   
means of access during their respective
invasions.                             
     The Channel silted up and is no   
longer used as a navigational passage, 
indeed its Northern entry is closed by 
the sea wall and is marked by a        
brackish lagoon known as Coldharbour.
