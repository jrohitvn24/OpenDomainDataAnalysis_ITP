		<content>{Trade in Wetton}                      
     Trade in Wetton is not all that   
bad.  Wetton pub does well especially  
in the summer and Bank Holidays,       
     The bed and breakfast places do a 
lot of trade on Bank Holidays, any     
other holidays and weekends - they are 
always full.                           
     A butcher comes around in a van   
from Butterton.  He delivers           
everywhere in Wetton.
