   There are six farms in this area,   
 one of which has a riding school. The 
 farms vary from 350 to 500 acres each.
 Part of one farmhouse dates from the  
 16th century and part of another from 
 the 18th century.                     
                                       
   A car is an essential means of      
 transport as the farms are situated   
 away from the nearest bus routes. Some
 farms have milk and newspapers        
 delivered daily, others do not. All   
 receive one postal delivery a day and 
 the postman will collect mail too.
