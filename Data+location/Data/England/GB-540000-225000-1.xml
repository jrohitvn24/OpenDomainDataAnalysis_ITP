		<title>01REMOTE FARMLAND</title>
		<content>                                       
  The main area is remote farmland with
 little variety of farming crops to    
 record.                               
 The countryside is gently undulating  
 with many wooded areas and narrow     
 winding lanes.                        
  Contrary to what you would expect it 
 is largely a commuter area and at     
 least half the children in school are 
 newcomers.                            
  The village where the school is      
 situated is right on the corner edge  
 of our Domesday block and 3/4 of the  
 children live outside this area. The  
 children have become very frustrated  
 by this artificial limitation         
 placed on their investigations.       
  The weather and other commitments    
 such as Sports Day and our concert    
 have made it difficult to get out and 
 about.                                </content>
