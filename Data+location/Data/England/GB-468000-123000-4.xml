		<title>04FARMING AT FROXFIELD GREEN-1</title>
		<content> We interviewed the manager of Venthams
 Estate, Froxfield Green about the     
 agriculture of the area. Venthams     
 Estate is 710 acres of which 510 are  
 cultivated, 17 acres of grassland the 
 rest is woodland. Another 190 acres of
 arable land is also farmed which is   
 rented. The estate is the main arable 
 farm of the area , with only two      
 employees, with some extra help at    
 harvest. This shows how mechanised the
 farm is, with relatively new          
 machinery, keeping costs of breakdowns
 and replacement low. The woodland is  
 used for pheasant shooting, and there 
 is a gamekeeper employed. About 1000  
 pheasants are reared a year. This is  
 not done to make a profit, but is     
 just a hobby of the owner. The other  
 field sport which takes place is      
 fox-hunting.                          
                                       </content>
