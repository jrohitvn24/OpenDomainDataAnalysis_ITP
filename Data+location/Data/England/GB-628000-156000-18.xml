		<title>18 DO WE NEED A BY-PASS?</title>
		<content>  I think we do need a by-pass in Ash  
because of all the lorries knocking    
down the reflector posts and going on  
the pavements.Last week a lorry drove  
on the pavement and broke a man-hole   
cover.In 1972,13 years,ago the gate    
pillars by the church were knocked     
down by a lorry.A few weeks ago,a      
lorry and a bus got jammed in the road 
and there was a huge traffic jam,and   
it took about 40 minutes to clear.     
 In the street there are many houses up
for sale because of all the exhaust    
fumes and noise from the lorries. Many 
of the lorries that go through Ash are 
coal lorries carrying shale,some carry 
fruit and vegetables,some are very long
car-transporters going to and from the 
car depot at Sandwich.                 
 The Street is very narrow and has many
old houses.It would be a very pleasant 
place to live &amp; shop if we had a bypass</content>
