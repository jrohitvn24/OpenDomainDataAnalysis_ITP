		<title>08THE PLOUGH INN</title>
		<content> The Plough at Pyecombe, which is over 
 3OO years old, is situated on the busy
 A23. Because of its situation it      
 relies heavily on passing trade, about
 7O% of the custom coming from these   
 people. The villagers do use the pub  
 but mainly between 7.3O pm and 9.OO   
 pm. Approximately 334 gallons of beer 
 are sold a week. The landlord, who    
 took over in February 1985, lives in  
 the pub and is a Sussex man. He       
 employs 4 people, one of whom is      
 responsible for the food he sells at  
 lunchtimes. The Plough has no         
 facilities for children. The Plough   
 was once a coaching inn. The front    
 wall is made of dressed flints. Inside
 it is divided into 2 bars with a back 
 room for darts and eating. It has low 
 wooden ceiling beams. The busiest     
 times are between 9 and 11.3O pm.
