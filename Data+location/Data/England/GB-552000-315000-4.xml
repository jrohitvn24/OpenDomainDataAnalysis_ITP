		<content> Of the people who live in Walpole many
 in some way or other are involved in  
 FARMING(see page 5).Other main places 
 of work are METAL BOX,FRANK IDEANS,   
 ANGLIA COMPONENTS,SMEDLEYS,BARON      
 MEATS and BALDING and MANSELLS all of 
 WISBECH.In the villages there are two 
 garages employing a few mechanics,    
 Kitchen specialists called HELENA     
 KITCHENS,and NENE FRUIT AND           
 VEGETABLES FACTORY who employ a       
 number of people mainly women.A number
 of people living in the village are   
 employed in service idustries both in 
 and outside the village e.g.Shop      
 Keeping,Banking,Teaching,Local        
 government and Lorry driving.With un  
 employment nationally at over 12% it  
 is not surprising to find a similar   
 percentage out of work in Walpole.
