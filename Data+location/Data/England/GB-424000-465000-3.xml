		<title>03LOCAL HISTORY SAWLEY HALL</title>
		<content> Sawley Hall was built in 1770,one of  
 only two Georgian houses built on  a  
 hill because there was a supply of    
 water.It was first built as a Dower   
 house for Lord Grantley's wife.Four   
 families have owned it-the Nortons,the
 Wormaulds,the Barrans,and since 1962, 
 the Fattorinis. In 1935 there were    
 1800 acres,in 1985 there are 80.There 
 are beautifully and exquisitely laid- 
 out gardens.In 1935 there             
 were 21 servants,now there are none,  
 just a housekeeper and a gardener.    
 There is a fire pond.There is a cock- 
 pit,hidden deep in a wood and sur-    
 rounded by two walls.There is a unique
 water pump driven by six horses.It    
 also served to grind corn and to saw  
 wood.They still have their own water  
 supply pumped by electricity.Sawley   
 Hall is not open to the public.
