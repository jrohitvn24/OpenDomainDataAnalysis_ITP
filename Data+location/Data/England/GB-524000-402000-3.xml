		<title>03The Waltham Village Tannery.</title>
		<content>   There has been a Tannery in Waltham 
 on the same site for three to four    
 hundred years in Skinners Lane. The   
 present building is one hundred years 
 old. At the bottom of the Lane were   
 some old lime pits which at some time 
 provided lime for use in the tanning  
 process.                              
   The Tannery employs twelve people.It
 produces leather suitable for         
 industrial clothing mainly for the    
  heavy engineering and mining         
 industries in this country.It also    
 exports leather to Scandinavian       
 countries,Canada and Mauritius.       
   It buys hide in the "wet blue"      
 stage and reprocesses it at the       
 tannery to produce leather.The hide   
 bought is a by product from the shoe  
 and upholstery industries.            
   The Waltham Tannery is one of two   
 tanneries in this country.            </content>
