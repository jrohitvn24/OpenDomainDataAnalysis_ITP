		<title>05CHANGES IN CHERRY WILLINGHAM</title>
		<content>   Cherry Willingham and Reepham have  
 seen several changes over the past few
 years (since the map was last revised 
 in 1976). The most important change   
 has occured outside our block but is  
 worth mentioning because it has been  
 the subject of much discussion. This  
 is the discovery of a large reserve of
 oil. Called the 'Welton Field' it     
 covers the area North and East of our 
 block with a railway sidings and      
 storage area just outside Reepham.    
  There has not been much building in  
 the area in the way of housing- about 
 80 houses in all-. An estate of about 
 300 houses is proposed in the centre  
 of the village but so far only one    
 house has been built for one of the   
 local personalities.                  
   Cherry Willingham has a new pub     
 which is in the Parade and after only 
 two years it is being extended.       </content>
