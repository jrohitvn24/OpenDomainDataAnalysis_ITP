		<title>06Borrowdale Peregrine Watch</title>
		<content> The peregrine falcon is a large rare  
 falcon.It catches anything up to the  
 size of a goose.It's call is a loud   
 shrill kek kek kek and a long         
 scream.Sometimes it will kill a rabbit
 or a vole.We watch the nest because   
 egg collectors and falconers steal the
 eggs or young.The watch is carried out
 from when the eggs are laid until the 
 young birds fly.One person would watch
 for three hours until the next person 
 came,unless you arrived at            
 9.30p.m.when you watched for nine     
 hours.The watchers are all volunteers 
 from the Keswick area.The eggs take   
 approximately thirty days to incubate.
 When the eggs have hatched it takes a 
 further seven weeks to fly.There are  
 usually four eggs in a clutch.If      
 someone tried to steal eggs the person
 on watch would go to the nearest      
 phone.                                </content>
