		<content> Gardening as a hobby is flourishing,  
 particularly the cultivation of lawns 
 and flower borders as an open-air     
 extension to the home.                
                                       
 Because the time most couples can     
 spend on gardening is restricted, they
 aim for an easy-care garden.  To meet 
 this need, lawns are mown by          
 mechanical mowers and borders have    
 largely ground cover plants which     
 smother weeds, and bulbs which, once  
 planted, bloom annually.              
                                       
 There are two nurseries: one producing
 heathers, for ground cover; the other 
 nerines, an autumn flowering bulb.    
                                       
 Close by there is another business    
 making and selling timber garden      
 furniture such as summer houses,      
 tables and chairs.                    </content>
