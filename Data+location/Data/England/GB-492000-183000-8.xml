		<title>08MARKET IN THE BEECHES</title>
		<content>The Burnham Beeches market has taken   
the place of the old fair that used to 
be there.This market was moved in 1984,
from Colnbrook,Bucks;to the Beeches.It 
is on Saturdays and begins early,      
lasting all day.There is a regular free
Bus service every half hour from Slough
Bus station.The market takes place on a
large flat gravel area with adequate   
parking on one side.The market is set  
up like a maze so you have to weave in 
and out the stalls.Most stalls are     
covered.The market is especially good  
for computer games,watch's,electronics 
and for clothes.There is a "toddlers   
fair"which has a roundabout,dodgems    
and double swings.The market is        
projected to stay in the Beeches until 
1986.It is situated next to the old    
swimming pool which was burnt down by  
vandals in 1983.
