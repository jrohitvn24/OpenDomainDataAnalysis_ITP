		<content>  The block is predominantly open      
 rolling hills covered in heather:     
 moorland, and quite high compared to  
 the surrounding countryside.   The    
 Eller                                 
 Back Valley in the N W is farmed and  
 has a few small woods interspersed    
 with grass fields and arable crops.   
 The N Yorkshire Moors Railway runs    
 along this valley.   The main A169    
 also passes through the block.   Many 
 peopel stop to enjoy the scenery and  
 to look at the  dales early warning   
 station dominating the southern       
 skyline.   Walking is also popular on 
 the moors and also around the         
 Goathland area.   The moors are used  
 for sheep grazing andf perhaps        
 bee-keeping &amp; grouse shooting.   The  
 only residents are the few farmers    
 living near to Gothland.
