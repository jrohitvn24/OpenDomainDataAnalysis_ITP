		<title>18A RIPPINGALE VIEW OF LIFE</title>
		<content> In Britain today,there is much comfort
 and contentment but also much squalor 
 and dissatisfaction.{Unemployment is  
{very high}with much of the working    
 population on a low rate of pay.Rented
 or council accomodation is in         
 inadequate supply and often of low    
 standard in spite of the efforts of   
 Government and local authorities,     
 welfare services and voluntary bodies.
 Other factors detrimental to the      
 quality of life are{vandalism}and a   
 lack of respect for other people's    
 property,lack of discipline and too   
 much expectation of the Welfare State.
{Conservation}of our countryside and   
 urban areas is now of great concern   
 and much is being done to enhance our 
 environment and conserve our heritage.
 New technology gives more leisure,a   
 fact not welcomed by all but          
 appreciated and utilised by many.     </content>
