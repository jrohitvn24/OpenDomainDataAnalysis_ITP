		<content> HOUSING.  Housing in village is mixed.
 There are cottages and houses of the  
 late Victorian era as well as more    
 modern houses. Six almshouses were    
 built in Station Road and are occupied
 at the present time. Most of the      
 housing is privately owned, only about
 20% being council owned.   There does 
 not appear to be any proposals to     
 expand the village geographically but 
 infill building may take  place where 
 space permits.   This can be seen in  
 the current development of housing for
 the elderly on the site of the old    
 Aspley Heath School which closed in   
 l981.                                 
 POPULATION. The Census Returns for    
 l98l show the population to be 2173 of
 which l646 were over the age of 16.At 
 the time 967 were working and 42 were 
 seeking work.(Figures from Census l981
 Small Area Statistics)                </content>
