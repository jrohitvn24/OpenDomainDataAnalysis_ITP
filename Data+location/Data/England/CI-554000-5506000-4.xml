		<title>04The Alderney Court</title>
		<content> In the Court there are seven          
 jurats(the equivalent of English      
 Magistrates )- five men and two women 
 who are appointed by the Crown.       
  If someone is caught drinking too    
 much it is called a criminal offence  
 and the maximum fine is 25 pence.(an  
 old Norman Law that has not been      
 repealed).A civil case is when the    
 Court deals with debts owing or people
 arguing.When there is a case in Court 
 three jurats have to be present.There 
 is a meeting in the Court every       
 Thursday afternoon and every month one
 afternoon is put aside for criminal   
 cases.Larceny,rape,murder,causing     
 bodily harm and anything serious have 
 to be tried in Guernsey.Guernsey is   
 also the first Court of Appeal.The    
 system of law is a mixture of English 
 and Norman.                           
                                       </content>
