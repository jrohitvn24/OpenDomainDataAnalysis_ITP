		<content>At the south end of Felixstowe over    
looking the harbour is the largest port
for containers in the UK. On a narrow  
peninsula of shingle protecting the    
harbour entrance there is a 16th C.fort
Landguard Fort is worth a visit. It was
built in 1534 and rebuilt in the 18th C
The land round the fort gives a good   
view of the sea. This is a listed      
monument under the protection of the D.
of the Environment.Across the Orwell   
estuary is Harwich. The original Domes 
day survey called this peninsula Long- 
stone and in 1534 it was Langerston.   
Today we call it Landguard Point.The   
fort houses a museum, opened in 1985,  
in the Ravelin Block, built in 1878.   
It is opened on Sunday afternoons by   
Felixstowe History &amp; Museum Society.   
There are 4 rooms about the floods of  
1953, soldiers since 1534, relics of   
the World War and general local history</content>
