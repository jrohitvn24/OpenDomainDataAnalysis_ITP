		<content> At 7.00 Dad gets up and washes and    
 dresses and gets the breakfast. At    
 7.45 he leaves the house for work.    
 Mummy gets our breakfast and we have  
 cornflakes or sugar puffs. 8.30 Mummy 
 washes and changes baby and at 9.00   
 she feeds baby. My brothers and I     
 watch T.V. after we have got dressed. 
 At 10.30 Auntie Mary comes and picks  
 us up and we go to Granpy's till Daddy
 comes home from work. At 13.00 we have
 our dinner and afterwards go to Nanny 
 Jackson where we often play in the    
 garden. At 16.30 we go home, have some
 tea, usually sandwiches and biscuits  
 and watch the television. At 18.00 we 
 have a bath and put on our pyjamas.   
 Mummy and Daddy and the children watch
 television together and then we go to 
 bed. Mummy and Daddy stay down and    
 watch T.V. until 22.00 and the baby is
 fed and put to bed about 21.00.       </content>
