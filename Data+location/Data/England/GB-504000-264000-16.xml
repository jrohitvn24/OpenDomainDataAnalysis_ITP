		<title>16Leisure in Swineshead</title>
		<content> Most leisure pursuits have to be done 
 outside the village as the village is 
 too small to maintain many clubs.     
 Within the village, a table tennis    
 club is run at the village hall during
 the winter. In the nearby village of  
 Pertenhall every month the Women's    
 Institute meet and ladies from the    
 surrounding villages are invited to go
 along. Each month a speaker is invited
 to come along and give a talk on any  
 subject from cake decoration to a     
 recent visit to Holland.              
 Towards the end of 1983 the Stodden   
 Churches Mother's Unionwas formed.    
 This is in addition to the existing   
 Swineshead and Pertenhall Mother's    
 Union. The aim was to start a group   
 with fairly young young people being  
 involved. They meet once a month and  
 discuss various topics relating to    
 moral and christian thoughts.         </content>
