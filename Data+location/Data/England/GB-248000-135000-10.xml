		<content> People in Braunton when asked don't   
 talk about ghosts and mysterious      
 happenings.There are however, some    
 stories.A young man called Ernest was 
 living at{Hartnoll farm}until 1951,   
 when he moved into a cottage in       
 Townend which backs onto the farm.    
 While he was a young man,he said was  
 convinced that the old house was      
 haunted.He recounted to his mother    
 how he had heard footsteps on the     
 stairs at night,on more than one      
 occasion. In{St.Michael's Chapel}a    
 ghostly figure in clerical garb is    
 supposed to have be seen moving       
 amongst it's ruins.At{Buckland House  
 a figure in white,is supposed to have 
 been a former inhabitant of the house.
 He frightens passers-by in Buckland   
 Wood by riding on horse back when     
 there is a full moon.Are these stories
 true? Decide for yourself!            </content>
