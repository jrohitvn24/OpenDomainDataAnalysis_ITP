		<title>05Village life-Baston.</title>
		<content> The village of Baston used to have 5  
{public houses}but now has only 2.     
 There is a rhyme incorporating the    
 names of the five:                    
 'The Black Horse kicked the White     
                                Horse  
  And made the Red Lion roar.          
  The Millstone threshed the Wheat     
                                Sheaf  
  And ground it on the floor.'         
 Many of the old village trades have   
 gone - wheelwrights,carpenters etc.   
 but there are still one or two new    
 houses being built bringing craftsmen 
 into the village for this work.       
 The larger public house has grown     
 larger and caters for people from much
 farther afield. Many of the villagers 
 now{commute}to the larger towns to    
 work instead of being mainly          
 orientated towards{agriculture}       
 although this influence still exists. </content>
