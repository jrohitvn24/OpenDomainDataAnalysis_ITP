		<content>  Mr Eales is a past chairman  of the  
 Parish Council.He helped to build the 
 Village Hall and has built 14 to 16   
 houses in the village. He has been a  
 parish councillor for 17 years. When  
 we asked him what he thought of the   
 village he said he would like to      
 go back 25 years and build the village
 again because houses were built on the
 skyline and it makes the village look 
 unattractive.                         
  The parish council for this area,    
 called Kerswells Parish Council       
 covered both Kingskerswell and        
 Abbotskerswell.In Spring 1984 the two 
 parish councils came into being, one  
 for each village.                     
  Looking to the future Mr.Eales said  
 that there were many faciities he     
 would like in the village. These      
 included a bowling green and some     
 tennis courts.                        </content>
