   The Church in Melling has similar   
problems,with only seven men and about 
twenty women regularly attending on    
Sundays. Financial responsibility      
rests with a few,as does maintenamce   
of the church and churchyard. Contact  
and co- operation on a village level   
between various denominations is       
better than appears nationally.        
Twenty years have seen a great         
increase in awareness of our heritage, 
and concern for buildings, old and     
new, and for the surrounding           
countryside. While the social life of  
the village is under threat there are  
signs that the  fabric may be          
preserved in spite of great pressures.
