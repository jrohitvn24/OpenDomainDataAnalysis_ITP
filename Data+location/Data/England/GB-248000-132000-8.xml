		<content> We interveiwed Mrs Dryden about were  
 and when she used to live.She told us 
 that she used to live in Slough just  
 out side London.She said that you     
 were more likely to get a job there   
 than you would here.We interveiwed Mr 
 Anderson who used to live in          
 Dunfermline in Scotland               
 he said that he used to work in the   
 mine, but now he is an ambulance      
 man.The reason why he moved down here 
 was because his wife got very         
 homesick.We interviewed Mrs Monson,she
 used to live in Kent.The reason why   
 they moved down here was because her  
 husband was a milkman he was transferd
 down here anyway they were glad about 
 that because most of there relations  
 were down here.
