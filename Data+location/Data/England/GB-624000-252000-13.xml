		<content>     Few people who live in the area   
also work here. The Forge employs      
twelve full time and three part time   
workers. The farms can be run with very
few men, and the shops, pub, garage and
school employ fewer than fifteen       
people full time although they provide 
part time work for many more than that.
Some women do part time domestic work  
in private houses. It is the part      
time workers usually who live locally. 
     Most people work outside the area,
the largest number are employed by the 
British Telecom Research Station at    
Martlesham. Felixstowe port also       
employs several and the rest commute   
to Melton, Woodbridge, Otley and       
Ipswich.
