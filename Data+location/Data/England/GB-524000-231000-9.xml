		<content>    The historic town centre of        
 Baldock, suffers severely from traffic
 problems. Although a bypass A1(M) has 
 now been provided for the Great North 
 Road, traffic leaving the A1(M) and   
 traffic on the A505, travelling to    
 East Anglia, passes through the town. 
 A bypass to provide relief has been   
 proposed since the early 1970's, but  
 economic problems and disagreement    
 over the route, have resulted in no   
 action to date, although there is now 
 a firm proposal for a route to bypass 
 the town to the north. Two public     
 consultation exercises have been held.
    The wide High Street is used as an 
 overnight stopping point for          
 commercial vehicles, and as a rest    
 point for long distance coaches.      
 Residents complain of the noise and   
 disturbance caused by these vehicles.
