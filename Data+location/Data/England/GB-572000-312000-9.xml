		<title>09HOUSING   Pentney &amp; Narboro'</title>
		<content> Much new building has taken place in  
{Narborough.}Old cottages have been    
 replaced on a different site by the   
 council and include old peoples homes.
 There have been three housing estates 
 built for private occupation and a    
 quantity of individual homes, and also
 two farmhouses and a new vicarage.    
 Nearly all new homes are bungalows.   
 Among the older buildings remaining   
 are the Hall and Mill, both listed    
 buildings. The Maltings closed but now
 house several new enterprises.        
                                       
 New building in{Pentney}is virtually  
 unknown as it is not regarded as a    
 growth area by the planners. Existing 
 building is a mixture of all eras and 
 is of ribbon type development rather  
 than in estate form.
