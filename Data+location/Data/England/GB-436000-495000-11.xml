		<title>11LANDSCAPE OF BROMPTON</title>
		<content> Brompton is located at the eastern    
 edge of the Vale of York.The village  
 is surrounded by open countryside     
 therefore giving the landscape a rural
 character.It is found in the valley of
 Brompton beck which flows from the    
 north east and joins the River Wiske  
 to the south west of the village.The  
 land to the west is generally         
 undulating,varying in height between  
 40 and 60 metres.To the south east it 
 rises sharply from 40 to 100 metres   
 above sea level.When the area is      
 viewed from this point the most       
 prominant features on the skyline are 
 the church tower,the chimney from the 
 old linen factory,the many red tiled  
 and the slate roofs of the houses,the 
 patchwork pattern of fields around the
 village and the individual farm houses
 that intersperse them.
