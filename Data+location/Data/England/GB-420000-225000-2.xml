 about 1870. The ground, now leased to 
 the club, stands in the grounds of    
 Lord Leigh's estate. The present      
 pavilion was built in 1964 and has    
 recently been extended. Many of the   
 matches are against local clubs but   
 also include touring teams from this  
 country and abroad. It is one of the  
 few cricket clubs to have a oak tree  
 growing on the field.

 purchased its present 12.5 acre site  
 in 1970. This land provides space for 
 two playing pitches and a club house  
 which gives excellent facilities for  
 playing and social activities. Three  
 teams play regularly, and sometimes a 
 fourth, involving more than 70 players
 drawn from a wide rural area.
