		<content>   We thought that a typical life in   
 the lives of two people in the area   
 may provide interesring reading and   
 therefore we introduce a well-known   
 farmer and a school boy.              
{A Day in the Life of a Farmer,June '85
   I rise at 7.00a.m. and at 7.30 meet 
 the men and allocate jobs then I check
 the crops and the stock.  Between 9.00
 and 10.00 I have breakfast and work in
 my office.  Around 11.00a.m I visit   
 the fields.  I lunch at 1.00p.m. and  
 read the daily papers. By 2.00 I am   
 back in the office.  Between 3.00 and 
 6.00 I work outside on the farm or    
 visit the workers.  At 6.00 I return  
 to the office and work.  Then I read  
 farming magazines and watch T.V.      
 until 9.00.  I have dinner at 9.00 and
 retire to bed at about 10.30p.m..
