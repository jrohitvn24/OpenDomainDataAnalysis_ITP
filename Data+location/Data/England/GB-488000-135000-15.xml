		<title>15SOCIAL CONCERNS - HOUSING</title>
		<content>  SOME OF THE RESIDENTS WERE WORRIED BY
 THE HARM TO THE CHARM OF THE AREA BY  
 THE POLICY OF INFILLING WHICH IS      
 BECOMING INCREASINGLY PREVALENT, AND  
 WHICH IS A VERY REAL SOCIAL CONCERN.  
 MANY OF THE LARGE HOUSES IN OUR AREA  
 HAVE VERY LARGE GARDENS AND WITH THE  
 INCREASING DEMAND FOR BUILDING LAND   
 THEIR OWNERS ARE BEING TEMPTED TO     
 APPLY FOR PLANNING PERMISSION AND TO  
 SELL OFF CHUNKS OF THEIR GARDENS FOR  
 DEVELOPMENT.THIS IS RESULTING IN A    
 MUCH HIGHER DENSITY OF POPULATION IN  
 THE AREA.THE LOCAL RESIDENTS          
 ASSOCIATION IS CURRENTLY VERY ACTIVE  
 IN OPPOSING SUCH DEVELOPMENT OF THE   
 AREA.
