		<title>15SHELFORD-LOCAL HISTORY</title>
		<content>  Shelford is a small village,         
 population 220 people situated on the 
 banks of the River Trent.There is     
 evidence of a settlement here from    
 earliest times;the name Shelford is   
 taken from the Anglo Saxon name which 
 means shallow ford.The river was      
 constantly deepened during the 18th   
 &amp;19th Centuries to carry heavier loads
 so the ford no longer exists.         
  The main industry is farming,with 9  
 farms in this small area.All of the   
 land is owned by the Crown and the    
 farmers pay rent on an annual basis.  
  The residents of Shelford fall into 3
 main categories;the farmers and those 
 associated with the farms;those who   
 have lived in Shelford all their lives
 and either work on the land or in     
 Nottingham;the people who are new to  
 Shelford who commute to Nottingham,   
 Newark or Leicester.                  </content>
