             ----------                
  The vet in Grindleford is owned by Mr
 and Mrs McDonald and helped  by Miss  
 James. They also have veterinary      
 surgery in Sheffield . They have a    
 surgery in Grindleford because it is  
 easier for the people that live in    
 Grindleford so they don't have to go  
 to Sheffield. The common problems     
 are stomach upsets and skin           
 conditions. Not many pets get runover 
 but in big towns and cities they do.  
 The most dangerous animals are wild   
 birds and snakes.                     
  The  animals  vets treat  are dogs,  
 cats, budgies, snakes and wild birds. 
 The most unusual animals that vets    
 treat are snakes and tarantulas. The  
 vets are very friendly and patient.   
 Today their instruments are very      
 modern and most pets recover rapidly. </content>
