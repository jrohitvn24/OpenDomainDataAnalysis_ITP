		<content> "The area I have to work as a         
 community Police Officer is about 2.25
 miles long and 1.5 miles wide,covering
 both rural and urban areas.My area is 
 covered on foot,I live in the area I  
 work and start and finish at home.My  
 working day starts with a light meal. 
 I have a 45 minutes meal break which I
 take at my discretion.A normal working
 day is taken up by visiting local     
 schools,calling at Community Centres  
 to deal with Police problems,covering 
 school crossings,general patrolling of
 the area to prevent crime occuring,   
 investigating crime which has         
 occured and making enquiries to trace 
 the people responsible.I then arrest  
 or summons then to attend court at a  
 later date,to answer the charge.Most  
 of my work is taken up with minor     
 crime.e.g.theft of pedal cycles,motor 
 vehicles,broken windows,washing lines.</content>
