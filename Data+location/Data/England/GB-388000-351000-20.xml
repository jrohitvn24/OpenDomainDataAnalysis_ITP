		<title>20Norton farming</title>
		<content> At first sight much of the land in the
Norton area has not changed in use or  
appearance.But with the slow encroach- 
ing influence of the nearby city of    
Stoke-on-Trent alterations have and    
still are taking place.                
 Although not on the massive scale of  
earlier this century, land is still    
being taken for residential use.Farmers
find it harder to make a living on the 
reduced acreages,especially on the cold
clay soil.Few crops are grown,even on  
land that once grew wheat,most farmers 
concentrate on cattle for meat or dairy
use. Some farms cease to live up to    
that name,the owners of the land either
renting it out for city dwellers'      
horses or allowing grass to grow then  
cutting it and selling the hay whilst  
they carry on a separate business.     
Other farms remain emtpy and vandalised
since their previous owner has died.   </content>
