		<content> With the increased mechanisation of   
 farming,less and less people are      
 employed by local farmers.The largest 
 farmer in the area,Mr.J.Nott,employs  
 only 5 men compared with over 20 men  
 thirty years ago.                     
 The local workforce has been less     
 affected by unemployment than have    
 workers in other parts of the         
 country,although some men employed in 
 light industry in local towns have    
 been made redundant.                  
 Villagers employed in offices,shops   
 and light industry travel to local    
 towns for their work.A small number   
 commute to London.                    
 The area has become more middle-class 
 and less working-class with a more    
 affluent workforce being able to      
 afford to travel further afield to    
 reach their place of work.
