		<title>12        FARMING</title>
		<content>   In seven out of our twelve squares  
 of the national grid, we discovered   
 that arable farming predominated.     
 Crops were in abundance, main crops   
 being wheat, barley, potatoes and     
 cabbage.                              
   Much of the land is grassland both  
 gazed and ungrazed land and some of   
 the grassland is cut for hay ready for
 winter feeding for the animals.  With 
 regards to animal farming we found    
 that sheep and cows were of the       
 greatest importance with most farms   
 having chickens for eggs and for meat.
   The main breeds of cattle are       
 Fresians at Merrishaw farm and Upper  
 Springs , for example and Charolais at
 Broomcroft.                           
   On the whole the farms had large    
 flocks of sheep and these were grazed 
 on three squares of our grid at       
 Kenley, Stone House and Harley.       </content>
