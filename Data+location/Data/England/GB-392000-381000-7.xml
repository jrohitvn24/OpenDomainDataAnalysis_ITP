 In the area we surveyed,all the roads 
 were category B or C.The road which   
 passed the Boars Head was the busiest 
 in fifteen minutes 8 cars 2 vans 2    
 bicycles and 2 pedestrians passed by. 
 This shows it was fairly busy.The     
 roads generally were in a bad         
 condition with potholes and weeds     
 growing.There were no verges or       
 footpaths alongside and the roads were
 narrow.There were 2 carparks near the 
 open country so people could enjoy the
 views and the wildlife.Across one of  
 the roads was an aquaduct carrying the
 macclesfiled canal.The tunnel was 3.2m
 high and 31m long.There were many     
 footpaths leading to the countryside, 
 crossing through farmland and parkland
 most paths were marked.Some following 
 private roads to farms and Lyme Park. </content>
