		<title>02BISHOPS LYDEARD SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The school was opened on April 1st(a  
 significant date?) in the year 1872.It
 was an "all-age" school until 1953    
 since then most of the children over  
 11 years have gone to Kingsmeade      
 School in Wivelescombe.At present     
 there are 262 children on roll in 8   
 classes.In 1978 the first stages of   
 modernising the original  building was
 begun,but this is still not finnished 
 with 4 classes and staffrooms etc. in 
 temporary accomadation.Of especial    
 interest is a weather vane on the roof
 of the school hall,this depicts a     
 crossing patrol lady showing children 
 across the road,coverage on television
 and the national press suggests that  
 this is the only one of its kind.The  
 main aim of the school is summed up in
 part of the school prayer which asks  
 children"to make our school a happy   
 place for all".                       </content>
