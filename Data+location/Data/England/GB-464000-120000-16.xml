		<title>16THEN AND NOW</title>
		<content> Over my 90 years in the village I've  
 seen many changes.Fire and floods have
 destroyed many buildings,new estates  
 have taken their place.Life in the    
 village is quite different now.Cars   
 have taken the place of the horse     
 needing speed signs at every street.We
 do have electric lighting,piped water 
 and main sewerage; a great change for 
 the better,but my thoughts go back to 
 the days when sheep bells tinkled on  
 the Downs,carter boys sang to their   
 horses as they plodded to and fro in  
 the fields.We have lost a few         
 shops,builders and blacksmiths but it 
 is still a beautiful place to live in.
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
