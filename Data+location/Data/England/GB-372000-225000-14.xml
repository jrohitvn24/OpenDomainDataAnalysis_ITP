		<title>14Horticulture near Newent</title>
		<content>  The land to the north of Newent is   
 light and sandy and very suitable for 
 the growing of a large range of       
 horticultural crops both in the open  
 and in artificial environments in     
 either glass houses or in polythene   
 tunnels. Crops grown include lettuce, 
 celery tomatoes and other popular     
 salad crops. Recently other more      
 exotic crops have been grown such as  
 peppers, aubergines and courgettes,   
 reflecting a more continental eating  
 trend. The industry is highly         
 competitive and the main concern is   
 the high cost of heating during the   
 winter. There was once a cooperative  
 marketing system the LSA in this area 
 known as The Scarr. This has been     
 replaced by a new group GMS and by    
 free marketing. There is stiff        
 competition from local farms who offer
 'pick your own'strawberries and fruit.</content>
