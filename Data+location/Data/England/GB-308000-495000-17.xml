		<title>17TOURISM IN RAVENGLASS</title>
		<content> Many residents of Ravenglass rely on  
 the tourist trade for their living    
 either through bed and breakfast or   
 because they own shops in the village.
 Recent adverse publicity about BNFL,  
 who have a large site at Sellafield,  
 10 miles to the north has led to a    
 drop in the number of tourists        
 visiting and staying in the area.This 
 has affected the livelihood of many   
 people living in Ravenglass.          
 BNFL is the largest employer in West  
 Cumbria.They monitor the beaches and  
 estuary very thoroughly but despite   
 these precautions sale of locally     
 caught fish has fallen greatly.At     
 present there is controversy over the 
 reason for the decline in the numbers 
 of breeding sea-birds.                
 Untreated sewage is also pumped out to
 sea but,despite this,Ravenglass has a 
 large percentage of elderly residents.</content>
