		<content>   We in the 3rd year of{HEATHCOAT     
{MIDDLE SCHOOL}have found out          
 information about the Halberton area. 
 first of all we started to do an      
{Amenities Survey.}We did it by going  
 around our area and listing all the   
 amenities we saw                      
   We found that the area was very low 
 in its amenities and there were very  
 few shops.There are 2 filling stations
 and they get their fuel from the      
 nearby {Esso Bulk Plant.}Both of the  
 filling stations have general stores  
 and also there is a repair garage.    
   There are 6 shops comprising a{Hair 
{Stylist , 4 General Stores , Fish and 
{Chip shop and 2 Pubs in the area. }   
  There is a small {First School}in    
 Halberton which was built in 1849 ,and
 has only 25 children and 2 teachers . 
 Near the school there is{ST. ANDREWS  
{CHURCH}.                              </content>
