		<content>  In 1696{a farmer}was on his way to{  
{Macclesfield}to sell a{white horse.}On
 his way an old man stopped him and    
 asked to buy it.The farmer refused,   
 then the old man said he would not    
 sell it at{the market}.It was true.On 
 his way back from the market the old  
 man stopped him again and took him to 
 an old{rock face}.He tapped it with a 
 staff and it opened.There lying on the
 cave floor was gold stacked in piles. 
 The old man instructed the farmer to  
 take what he wanted in return for his 
 horse. Before he went, the farmer had 
 a chance to see{King Arthur and his   
{knights}asleep.The old man has not    
 been seen since.                      
  The Edge is also famous for its      
{witches}who are supposed to hold      
{covens,}especially on{Halloween night.
 After midnight people come from all   
 around the district to see the sight. </content>
