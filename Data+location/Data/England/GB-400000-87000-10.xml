		<content> Brownsea Island is part of the parish 
 of St. Peter's Parkstone. St. Peter's 
 clergy administers this island church 
 and also supply the choir and         
 organist. The vicar is Reverend       
 P.R.Huxham, and there is also a church
 warden who lives on the island.       
 Services are held every Sunday        
 afternoon at three o'clock from Easter
 until September and the church is open
 daily during this time. The church is 
 used for christenings and weddings for
 the island residents. The most recent 
 wedding was the warden's daughter. It 
 took an ecumenical form.              
 The oldest grave to be found in the   
 churchyard was laid in 1869 and the   
 most recent in 1984. The crypt has    
 recently been discovered, containing  
 one coffin.The church supports various
 charities,e.g."Save The Children"and  
 has raised Â£1500 for Ethiopia.        </content>
