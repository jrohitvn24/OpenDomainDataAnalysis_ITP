		<content> This are covers a largely{residential 
{and industrial}part of the town of    
 Workington. The industry is           
 concentrated in a strip along the     
 coast with the residentail area to the
 east on slightly higher ground.The    
 area had an{important industrial past 
 but that has changed dramatically over
 the last 10 years.{High rates of      
{unemployment}exist in the area and    
 great efforts are being made to       
 encourage new industries to develop   
 here,hence the regions status as an   
{Enterprise Zone.}The steel industry is
 still the most important industry in  
 this area,but this is a shadow of it's
 former self.The area inclides those   
 parts of Workington called            
{Harrington,Mossbay,Salterbeck,        
{Westfield and part of Moorclose.}These
 last three areas make up a large      
 council housing estate.               </content>
