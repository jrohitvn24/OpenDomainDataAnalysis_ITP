		<content> MY LEISURE TIME by Ian Holmes         
 Since I moved to Claybrooke I enjoy a 
 more social life.On Wednesday I go to 
 Scouts for two hours. On Thursday I go
 to my Judo class in Lutterworth for   
 an hour. On Saturday I will be in a   
 Judo competition. I enjoy football    
 most of all so on Friday I go to      
 Lutterwoth Under 11's Football Club   
 for training. On 17th May I was       
 awarded the Under 11's Most Improved  
 Player of 1984-5.                     
 MY LEISURE TIME by Trudy Goodband     
 On Thursday when I got home from      
 school I made a felt picture of summer
 before I got ready for my Trampoling  
 class in Lutterworth. It lasts from   
 5.30 to 6.30pm. On arriving home I    
 had my tea and then went to Guides    
 in Ullesthorpe from 7.30 to 9.00pm.
