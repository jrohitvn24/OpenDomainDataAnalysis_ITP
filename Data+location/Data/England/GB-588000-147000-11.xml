		<content>   Farming in this area has now become 
 highly mechanised, with a small       
 skilled workforce.  Farms have become 
 larger units specialising in the pro_ 
 duction of cereals, soft and hard     
 fruit, sheep, pigs and dairy cattle.  
 Fields are larger to accommodate the  
 machines used. Apples and pears are   
 grown on smaller trees and when picked
 cold stored until graded, packed and  
 sent to market.  Blackcurrants are    
 machine picked and contracted to juice
 producers. Grass has become a managed 
 crop for both silage and hay. Sheep   
 graze the rough grassland. Dairy herds
 are kept inside for much of the year  
 in deep strawyards and houses, with   
 summer grazing only.  Pigs are kept in
 intensive rearing units.  Farms are   
 still family concerns but run on very 
 efficient business lines with attent_ 
 ion paid to the profit margins.       </content>
