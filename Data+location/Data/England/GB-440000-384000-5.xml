		<content>   The station in Woodhouse was built  
 in the 1880's.  It has two            
 platforms for trains which go to      
 Sheffield, Retford, Lincoln and       
 Cleethorpes.  It is used by one       
 hundred people each day and trains    
 pass through it every forty minutes.  
 The station has two bridges made of   
 concrete which go over the tracks.    
 There are four railway tracks in use  
 and one that is rusted over.  The     
 railway tracks are made of metal with 
 wooden and concrete sleepers. The     
 first track was called the Old Road   
 and it was the main line from Hull to 
 Liverpool.  Most of the trains that   
 pass through Woodhouse Station are    
 passenger trains, mail trains or      
 freight trains.
