		<title>03The Writing on the Wall</title>
		<content>   By our house there is a maisonette  
 with graffiti all over the front door 
 and under the window. It has "Munich  
 '58" and "The Strand Rule O.K."       
 written on it, and there are lots of  
 people's names on it as well. They    
 have sprayed paint all over the front 
 door and they have smashed a bedroom  
 window. Everyone says that drug       
 addicts are moving into it. An old    
 lady used to live there but she moved 
 out because the boys used to torment  
 her. Once they smashed her window and 
 she telephoned the police. They came  
 and caught two of them and took them  
 to the old lady. She recognised them  
 and they were taken to the police     
 station.                              
    Three days later they went to court
 and their parents were made to pay for
 all the damage.
