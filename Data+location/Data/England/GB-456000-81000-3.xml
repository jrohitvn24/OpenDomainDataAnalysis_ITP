		<title>03CLIFF LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content> Sandown and Shanklin cliffs are made  
 of lower greensand which is a type of 
 sandstone.There are birds which nest  
 in holes in the cliff.They use the wet
 sand to build their nests.These do not
 spoil the overall appearance of the   
 cliff,because they build their nests  
 on the ledges.Before 1971,when the sea
 defence wall was built,the cliff was  
 being eroded quite rapidly .The sea   
 wall forms a link between Hope Beach  
 and Yaverland,along which authorised  
 vehicles can travel.It also can be a  
 pleasant walk.At{Sandown the beach was
{popular enough to be considered a     
{Euro-beach in 1973/4}and was free     
 enough from pollution to pass.However,
 there are some sewage outlets coming  
 from the sea defence wall.
