		<content>   The North Yorkshire County Primary  
 School at Felliscliffe serves most of 
 our block.  Children in Menwith go to 
 Darley School and in High Birstwith to
 Birstwith School. It has 28 pupils,   
 two full-time teachers and one        
 part-time teacher, and is housed in   
 the old Victorian Board School, which 
 now also incorporates the former      
 schoolhouse, thus giving very spacious
 accomodation.                         
   Most pupils come from the           
 surrounding area, though the local    
 private sector attracts growing       
 numbers.                              
   There is enthusiastic parental sup- 
 port helping towards the aquisition   
 of new equipment, e.g.,  computer and 
 video.                                
   North Yorkshire has a strong policy 
 of supporting small rural schools.
