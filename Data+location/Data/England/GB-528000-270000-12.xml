		<title>12Oliver Cromwell, St Ives</title>
		<content> Oliver Cromwell is perhaps the most   
 famous person to have lived locally.  
 He was born in Huntingdon in 1599,    
 married in 1620 and died in 1658 at   
 the age of 59.                        
                                       
 A bronze statue of him stands         
 prominently on Market Hill in St Ives.
 This statue is at present being       
 refurbished at a cost of Â£800.        
                                       
 Cromwell's life and that of his family
 is very well documented. Papers, books
 and documents can be seen at the      
 Norris Museum in St Ives. Further     
 study can be undertaken at the        
 Cromwell Museum in Huntingdon, where a
 death mask can be seen. This museum is
 housed in the building where the young
 Oliver went to school.
