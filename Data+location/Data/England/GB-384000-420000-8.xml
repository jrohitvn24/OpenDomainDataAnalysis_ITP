		<content> Our D-Block is served by Rossendale   
                                       
 Borough Council buses mostly. There is
 a good, regular service which runs    
 from Rawtenstall to Bacup, passing    
 through Stacksteads. If you want to go
 out of the valley there are buses from
 Bacup to Burnley and to Rochdale. If  
 you go to Rawtenstall you can catch   
 buses to Bury, Bolton and Manchester. 
 There used to be a railway between    
 Rawtenstall and Bacup and there was a 
 station at Stacksteads. It was used   
 mostly by people going to work or     
 children going to school, but it      
 closed about 20 years ago. You can    
 still see where the tracks were and   
 there are still bridges. If you go    
 through the glen you can see the old  
 tunnels which are now used by the     
 Council to store salt and grit for the
 roads in winter.                      </content>
