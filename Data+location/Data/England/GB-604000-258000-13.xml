		<title>13Stowmarket : other churches.</title>
		<content>There are many different churches. The 
parish church, Methodists, United      
Reformed Church,Roman Catholic Church  
and Salvation Army all join together   
occasionally for united services.      
     Some of the members of these      
churches joined together as part of the
Mission England Choir in 1984; they    
have kept together and are now an      
Evangelistic Choir. The churches of the
area are also joining together for a   
"Mission to Stowmarket" in 1986.       
   The Baptist Church, which has about 
100 members takes no part in these     
activities.                            
       Other churches are the Elim     
Church, the Gospel Hall, the Exclusive 
Brethren and Jehovah's Witnesses.
