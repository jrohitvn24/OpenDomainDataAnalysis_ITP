		<title>11INDUSTRY IN THE TADLEY AREA</title>
		<content> Industry in Tadley has grown since the
 days when it was famous for its besom 
 makers. The much deplored scrap yards 
 are relics of the days when it was a  
 gypsy community. The small industrial 
 estates at Paices Hill and Stacey's   
 Yard include the ubiquitous computer  
 systems manufacturers; makers of      
 portable buildings, laboratory        
 equipment, windows and double glazing 
 units, cement and aluminium, as well  
 as plant and car hire firms; boiler   
 maintenance and refrigeration         
 engineers; printers; car repair firms;
 welders; and coal, bottled gas and    
 timber merchants. There are carpet    
 cleaners, caterers and commercial     
 photographers. The Calleva Industrial 
 Park is not yet fully operational but 
 like the estates many of the units    
 will be storage depots rather than    
 actual manufacturing units.           </content>
