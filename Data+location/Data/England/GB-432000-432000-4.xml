		<content>    The estate owns two 18 hole golf   
 courses, football and cricket pitches 
 and a sports arena which is used by   
 many schools in the area.  For younger
 children there is an adventure        
 playground.                           
    A very important part of the estate
 is the Home Farm which has over 300   
 animals.   There are horses, cows,    
 sheep,goats, ducks, geese, turkeys and
 hens.   Many of the animals are rare  
 breeds which we can learn about during
 school visits to the farm.            
    The oldest building on the farm is 
 the Great Barn, which was built in    
 1694, you will have to climb the      
 stairs to look at the great beam to   
 see that,take no notice of the datee  
 on the brickwork outside!   When the  
 barn was restored some of the timber  
 came from Kirkstall Abbey. In the barn
 are stables for the working horses.   </content>
