 Everyone has a family{doctor.}All     
 people who work,pay{National Insurance
 so everyone can have free treatment.  
 Adults pay for medicine but children  
 and O.A.P's do not.People go to the   
{Opticians}for{glasses}.There are free 
 glasses but most people have fashion- 
 able frames and they pay for these    
{(average cost Â£50)}I go to the school 
{dentist}at{Redruth.}Treatment for     
 children is free.If you have an       
 accident you would be taken to the    
{City Hospital}in{Truro.Tehidy hospital
 has no accident department but can    
 hold up to{80 patients}at the same    
 time.They do not operate on patients  
 any longer.There is at 60 least staff 
 working at the{hospital.}People come  
 to{Tehidy}to get better from          
 operations.
