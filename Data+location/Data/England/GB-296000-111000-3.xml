		<title>03COWLEYMOOR HOUSING ESTATE</title>
		<content>   Cowleymoor is situated on the       
 northern outskirts of{Tiverton.}The   
 area is a typical{housing estate}with 
 about{400 houses}and{2 schools.}Most  
 of the houses are made of             
 pre-fabricated{concrete.}Some houses  
 are{36 years old.}Most of these houses
 are council property and are a bit    
 crumbly and old.                      
   The rest of the buildings are       
 privately owned houses. They were     
 built in{1935}and are{50 years old.   
 The  private houses and               
 council houses are mixed. One         
 hundred  years ago there were fields  
 and moorlands,hence the name          
{Cowleymoor.}The rest of the area is   
{farmed grassland}owned by{Knightshayes
{Estate.}                              
   We think in the future the estate   
 will be replaced with new houses.
