		<title>03ASHILL VILLAGERS EMPLOYMENT</title>
		<content> Most of the employed people work      
 outside the village.{Watton, Swaffham,
{Thetford, E. Dereham &amp; Norwich}being  
 the usual places of employment.       
 Inside the village the 3 larger farms 
 employ a few men each. The engineering
 shop has 5 employees and the plant    
 hire company employs about 15. Several
 people work within the building trade,
 quite often self employed. The men    
 employed on the farms enjoy a friendly
 relationship with their employers and 
 disputes are generally unheard of.    
 Further afield factories at{Thetford  
 are a large source of employment,     
 several area reps of large companies  
 live in the village and the local     
 military establishments (mainly       
 airfields) mean there are several     
 servicemen. A new prison at{Griston   
 has just caused an influx of "warders"
 etc.                                  </content>
