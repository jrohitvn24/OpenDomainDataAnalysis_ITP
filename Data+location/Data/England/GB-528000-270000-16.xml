		<content> Six hundred thousand people, of all   
 ages, use the St Ivo Recreation Centre
 in a year. It costs a quarter of a    
 million pounds to run. It provides a  
 centre for all kinds of sport and     
 entertainment for people from a wide  
 area. Although it makes a loss, one of
 the public, a pensioner, thinks it is 
 money well spent. He sets aside an    
 hour every day for weight training and
 swimming to help him keep fit and     
 enjoy his retirement. Whole families  
 use the centre and the five children  
 who researched this report use it for 
 Judo, racket ball, swimming, tennis,  
 athletics and roller skating. Swimming
 is the most popular sport. Many people
 enjoy music, discos, dances, drama,   
 and exhibitions in the large          
 entertainment hall. We are lucky to   
 have this centre in our area.
