		<content>   The self-sufficient communities that
 grew in this part of the{ancient      
{wealden forest,}gradually changed with
 improved road transport and the       
 introduction of the railway.{Farming} 
 remains the dominant industry while   
 many local trades and crafts have     
 disappeared.{Cinderhill} is a reminder
 of the great{iron}industry that once  
 flourished.                           
   The area is well-served by trains to
{London}and easy access to{motorways.  
 With few exceptions the population    
 enjoys a pleasant life style living in
 modernised properties and converted   
{barns}and{oasts.}Old cottage{crafts } 
 are being revived as hobbies,while the
{church,clubs}and{associations}further 
 enrich local life. A choice of good   
{school}and adequate{medical care,     
 particularly for the young and old,   
 make it a pleasant place to live.     </content>
