		<title>13BIRDS AROUND WADEBRIDGE</title>
		<content> Wadebridge has a wide variety of      
 habitat including{woodland}in{        
{Coronation Park, tidal estuary of the 
{River Camel}and{open grassland}.Birds 
 observed this year include :buzzard,  
 blackcap, barn owl, cormorant, coot,  
 coal tit, firecrest, garden warbler,  
 sedge warbler, heron, kingfisher,     
 moorhen, sand martin, spotted and pied
 flycatchers, spotted and green        
 woodpeckers, tawney owl, white fronted
 geese, peregrine falcon, water rail,  
 mute swan, swift, and marsh tit.      
 Most of these birds breed in the area 
 but there are many migrant birds that 
 visit in winter.                      
 On the islands in the river by the    
 bridge the cubs and scouts have built 
 sites to encourage the mute swans to  
 nest so that people may see them. This
 year the second clutch of eggs hatched
 but the cygnets did not survive.      </content>
