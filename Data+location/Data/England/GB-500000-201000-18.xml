		<title>18HURDY GURDY AND BAGPIPES</title>
		<content>      The hurdy gurdy is a rather      
 strange instrument.You have to wind a 
 handle and play keys which changes the
 sound of which the handle makes.The   
 hurdy gurdy has a drone sound like the
 bag pipes except you don't have to    
 blow.                                 
                                       
 Scotland and Greece had bagpipes and  
 all the countries between them had    
 them too. England have only got one   
 kind of bagpipes and they are called  
 the Northumbrian pipes. The loudest   
 bagpipes come from Scotland. The Greek
 bagpipes were made from the skin of a 
 goat.
