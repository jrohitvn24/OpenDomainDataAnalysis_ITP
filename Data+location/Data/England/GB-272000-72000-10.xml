		<title>10FARMING  DARTMOOR</title>
		<content>      Most farmers rear sheep and beef 
 cattle.They grow kale and some turnips
 to feed their stock in the long, cold 
 winter.Sheep graze on kale during the 
 day and are put into pasture fields at
 night.Most enclosed land is pasture . 
      Beef provides the main profit in 
 some cases.Calves are kept for two    
 years and then sent to market and the 
 money is used to restock.Sheep are    
 mainly White-faced Dartmoors,Welsh    
 Blacks or Pedigree Lleyns.They are    
 sheared in June-July.The fleeces are  
 sold at Buckfastleigh for Â£3-Â£4       
 each.The farmers remember the bad     
 winter of 1962-3.It lashed with rain  
 all Christmas Day and it started      
 snowing in the evening.The snow       
 reached the hedge-tops and lasted     
 until March.This year,April snow      
 covered the  sheep and lambs' grazing 
 ground and hay was in short supply.   </content>
