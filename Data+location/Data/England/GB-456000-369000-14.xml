		<title>14Life in Cuckney pre 1914.</title>
		<content> Mr.Dearnley of Cuckney remembers that 
 once toll charges had to be paid      
 before anyone entered the village.    
  The house on the corner of the       
 crossroads used to be an infant school
 with the present school being a senior
 school.In Cuckney the community was   
 served by a Co-op shop,a baker,a      
 butcher,a general store,and a doctor. 
 He had a surgery opposite the         
 "Greendale Oak" and when a person was 
 ill, straw and bracken was laid in    
 front of houses to stop any noise     
 which might disturb the patient.      
  A bequest to the poor of Cuckney     
 provided a pension of 10 shillings per
 week,a free joint of beef,and a free  
 loaf of bread.If people wanted to go  
 to Mansfield or Nottingham by train   
 the nearest station was a 3 mile walk.
  Most people travelled by horse and   
 cart or walked to their destination.  </content>
