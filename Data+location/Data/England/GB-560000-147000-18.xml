 Nursery.They grow apples,tomatoes and 
 cucumbers.They also grow flowers      
 especially roses which they sell on   
 the site.There are very large glass   
 houses where they grow the flowers.   
  At the back of the nursery are some  
 stables where they keep a few horses.

 in stock every year.They import 50% of
