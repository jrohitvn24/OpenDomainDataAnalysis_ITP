 Industry in Farington revolves round a
 mixture of old and new buildings. Mill
street linked the main Preston Leyland 
R to the mill and many of the workers  
lived in the street of terraced        
housing. The original mill was built in
l830s is now nearly demolished and on  
the site are a number of small single  
storey industrial units.  Most of these
are supplying the adjacents larger     
industrial units. The modern 1970s     
build of British Leyland offices stands
trast to the rather dirtied units of   
the rubber and paint works.            
During recent years British Leyland    
have virtually redeveloped their       
buildings, extending some and          
demolishing others. A fine example of a
odern factory is the Spurrier works    
just by the Farington By Pass and      
adjacent to rail links.                </content>
