		<content> Attitudes to life in Birtley vary     
 depending on whether you have a job or
 not and since the Caterpillar Tractor 
 Company closed many are unemployed.   
 Many people, particularly young       
 unemployed, get drunk, vandalize      
 Birtley and just hang around the      
 streets looking for trouble.          
    Some pupils have the wrong attitude
 and hate school there is a lot of     
 truancy but most people get caught.   
 Fifth year pupils may get a job or    
 Youth Training Scheme. The YTS pay is 
 only '25 a week many think it is slave
 labour and a waste of time. Most      
 people in Birtley are sick of the     
 present government but know that the  
 next lot will not be much better. The 
 attitude of most people is "life is   
 hard but make the best of it."
