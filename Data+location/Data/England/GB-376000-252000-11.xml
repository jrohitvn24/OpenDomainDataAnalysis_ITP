      Leisure pursuits are many and    
 varied.  There is horse riding within 
 the area and at Bensfield the Ever-   
 green Club has Bingo sessions.  Other 
 activities take place at the local    
 Memorial Hall, in nearby villages, in 
 Malvern and Worcester. For young      
 people there are Brownies, Guides,    
 Cubs, Youth Club and Swimming Club.   
 Adults are offered clubs for garden-  
 ing, cycling, clay pigeon and rifle   
 shooting and squash, as well as a Wine
 Circle and Women's Institute.  A      
 Sports Centre is easily accessible in 
 St. John's, on the outskirts of       
 Worcester.  There is an annual village
 show and occasional dances at the     
 Memorial Hall.  Fishing and gardening 
 are favourite pursuits, as well as    
 television and, increasingly, home    
 computers.                            </content>
