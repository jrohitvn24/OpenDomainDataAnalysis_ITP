		<title>11NORWOOD PARK - THE FARM</title>
		<content>    Norwood Park is a dairy farm of 250
 acres with about 260 cows. They use a 
 system of strip grazing where the herd
 is confined to a small area of grass, 
 surrounded by electric fencing. The   
 following day they are given a new    
 area to graze. The fields are cut for 
 silage and the cut grass is stored    
 under black plastic until it is needed
 to feed the cows in the winter. The   
 cows are milked at 5am and 3pm each   
 day. The modern milking parlour milks 
 10 cows at a time. The cow's identity 
 number is typed into a computerised   
 system which feeds each cow the       
 correct amount of high protein cake   
 and records the amount of milk given. 
 The milk is chilled ready to be taken 
 away. As well as meadow land the farm 
 has a small 14 acre apple orchard. The
 apples are sold for commercial cider  
 making.                               </content>
