		<content>{Farming:}In{Scaynes Hill}there is a   
 market garden owned by Mr.Cox.He owns 
 70 acres and grows:-                  
 blackberries,blackcurrants,redcurrants
 raspberries,gooseberries,greengages,  
 rhubarb,apples,pears and plums.He     
 also produces a few cherries,apricots 
 and peaches.He only has 1 greenhouse  
 for personal use and is thinking      
 of getting more.He uses fishbone blood
 fertiliser and spends Â£50/year on it, 
 and also buys Â£400 worth of weed      
 killer/year.Mr &amp; Mrs Cox employ no    
 one.As they only have 1 month in a    
 season when the fruit is ripe,they let
 people pick their own and send some to
 shops.They have large orders from the 
{Glyndebourne}music festival every     
 year.For the rest of the year they    
 prune,weed and fertilize their        
 land.The Cox's do not make a profit as
 fruit is cheap.                       </content>
