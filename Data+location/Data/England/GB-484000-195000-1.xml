		<content>    This area of natural beauty in the 
Chilterns is on the hills to the north 
of the 700 years old town of High      
Wycombe.Before the late 1950s the      
villages of Naphill,Downley and Cryer's
Hill were small hilltop communities    
with another residential area in       
Hughenden Valley.Housing estates,built 
from the 1960s onwards,have greatly    
increased the size of these villages,  
roads have been improved and schools   
built.                                 
    A large proportion of the land is  
agricultural with about a fifth of the 
total area covered by woodland,largely 
beech with some mixed deciduous and    
coniferous areas.There are some small  
industrial areas,one furniture factory,
the headquarters of TRADA and a        
conference centre.                     
    Hughenden Manor,a National Trust   
property,is a tourist attraction.      </content>
