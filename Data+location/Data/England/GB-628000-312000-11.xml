    {____________________              
 On Friday 5th July we interviewed Pam 
 Tooke at her{Post Office}which is 300 
 yrs old. It was once a{gig shed}for   
 storing carriages and was also used   
 for{stabling.}A new shop was built    
 onto the original building in 1984.   
 Unlike many of the older buildings in 
 the village, the roof is tiled and has
 never been thatched.The Post Office is
 a very friendly place and the         
 villagers always stop to chat to      
 Pam.During holiday periods lots of    
 holidaymakers use the shop. Pam's     
 husband has lived in Salhouse all his 
 life.Pam used to work for a large     
 insurance company in{Norwich}but      
 prefers to work in her Post Office.She
 likes talking to all her customers but
 not when they argue with her.
