		<content> Chertsey has many open areas used for 
 sporting activities. Chertsey Meads is
 used for British Motor Cross (BMX)    
 trials. The Abbey Fields are used by  
 the local boys' football team, Abbey  
 Rangers, on Sunday mornings.          
 Victory Park, Addlestone has tennis   
 courts, bowling green and areas for   
 football and cricket.                 
 Abbey Barn is owned and used by the   
 Acorn Theatre Group who rehearse      
 regularly on Saturday afternoons.     
 The Weybridge Rowing Club is based at 
 the confluence of the rivers Wey and  
 Thames. It has equipment for rowing   
 and sculling.                         
 There are no swimming pools or cinemas
 in the area. The nearest place with   
 these facilities is Staines, which is 
 about five miles from Chertsey.
