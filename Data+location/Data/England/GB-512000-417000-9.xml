		<content> There is a story that, in the cellar  
 of a house in Townside, is a cauldron 
 in which lives a wicked elf.          
    Acccording to the story one man who
 touched the cauldron some thirty years
 ago was,shortly afterwards, killed    
 by a horse drawn rake.                
   When the house was modernised a few 
 years ago a sevice of exorcism was    
 performed and the cauldron bricked up.
 The builder who did the work fell from
 a ladder shortly afterwards and broke 
 his leg.
