		<content> Pangbourne is an attractive           
 Thames-side village.                  
{Library:}                             
         The library was built in 1974 
 on a spot where once stood a          
 fire-station (the new fire-station is 
 in Horseshoe Road); it replaced a     
 small room in the old Town Hall.  The 
 Library has 10 000 books and 3 300    
 members; Saturday mornings are most   
 busy.  A record of missing books is   
 kept.  Exhibitions are held regularly.
{Combined Infant and Junior School:}   
         There are 160 junior and      
 primary pupils and 90 infants.  The   
 teachers number 12.  The school       
 dinners cost 65p for a set menu for   
 all children.  Educational trips are a
 part of the curriculum; a BBC computer
 is used by the Junior pupils.
