		<title>10Tandridge Village</title>
		<content>    The village of{Tandridge}is roughly
{4  miles }from {Oxted} ( which  can be
 approached by the{A25}).  There  is  a
 small Primary School for children aged
{4-8 years,}with about 65 pupils.  This
 is  partly  run  by{ St.Peter's Church
 which is on top of Tandridge Hill.    
  About half way down is a{Blacksmith's
 run  by  Mr.R.C.Larkin, &amp; further down
 is {The 'Barley Mow',}a  fairly  large
 Public House  &amp;  Restaurant with a big
 car  park  outside.  The  building  is
 completely white.  Next to it is where
 Sir John and Lady Burnett live.  Their
 house has a long drive with a lodge at
 the beginning.                        
  Opposite is the{Village Hall}which is
 next to the School.   This is used for
 weddings, discos and other events. All
 around  Tandridge  are fields used for
 grazing and growing crops.
