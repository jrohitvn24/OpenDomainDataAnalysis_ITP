		<content> The Nottinghamshire Miners            
 convalescent Home was opened in       
 1969.Its 30 metres from the beach.It  
 is not a holiday home.Its a           
 convalescent home for injured and     
 retired miners.It takes 800 patients a
 season and it has 15 staff.The        
 property is valued at over one million
 pounds.There are 35 bedrooms and 18   
 bathrooms.There is a TV room,a sun    
 lounge,and beautiful gardens.Mr and   
 Mrs Gills run it and came from the    
 city of Nottingham.The miners come in 
 coaches and cars.When the Home closes 
 in the winter a Safety School giving  
 lectures for miners takes place.The   
 1984/5 strike did not affect the      
 numbers of people coming.In winter the
 Home with its big kitchen sometimes   
 make mince pies for the school Xmas   
 functions.
