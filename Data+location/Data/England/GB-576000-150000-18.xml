		<title>18TWO LOCAL ARTISTS</title>
		<content> Graham Clarke and Brian Higbee are two
 well-known artists living in Boughton 
 Monchelsea. Many of the paintings they
 sell are etchings. Graham Clarke's are
 usually arch-topped, humorous         
 countryside scenes, and he and his    
 friends often appear in them, as do   
 sheep. He thinks that living in the   
 country helps him to paint. His little
 weatherboarded cottage studio that    
 stands behind his old hall-house has  
 been extended to allow for his        
 interest in printing and silly musical
 instruments; he has the world's only  
 Gastaphone, made from a guitar, an    
 abacus, and a keyboard.               
 Brian Higbee's pictures tend to be    
 small with intricate detail and       
 depicting flowers, animals and country
 buildings. One of his chief pastimes  
 is folk-singing, much of which he does
 for charity.                          </content>
