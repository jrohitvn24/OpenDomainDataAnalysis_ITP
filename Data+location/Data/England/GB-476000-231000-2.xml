  Living in a small village has its    
rewards but also its difficulties.     
Great Horwood has two small shops, one 
which also acts as a Post Office, two  
Public houses and a garage, formerly   
the blacksmiths', which no longer sells
petrol.For most things, weekly         
shopping, doctors, dentists and        
secondary schools a journey away from  
the village is needed. Although        
secondary pupils are bussed to school, 
there are few public transport         
facilities. Private cars are essential,
although some people cycle or walk to  
the nearest town,Winslow, some two     
miles distant.                         
  Mobile services provide library      
facilities and there is even a mobile  
gymnasium for the keep-fit enthusiasts.
