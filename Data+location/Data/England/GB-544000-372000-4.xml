		<title>04Beef Farming - Farlesthorpe</title>
		<content> The farmer owns Ivy House Farm in     
 Farlesthorpe. His grandfather bought  
 the farm in 1932 when it covered 35-40
 acres. It has since been handed down  
 through the generations and now it    
 covers 83 acres.                      
 He is a mixed farmer but predominant  
 in beef farming. He keeps pigs, bull  
 beef and heifers. The bull beef are   
 kept for 13-14 months and then sold.  
 He also grows crops; peas (12 acres), 
 cereals (33 acres), barley (15 acres).
 Most of the barley is used on the farm
 for feeding the intensive bull beef.  
 The wheat is sent away for milling and
 eventual human consumption.           
 The land is fertile but still needs   
 improvement by fertilisers. He owns   
 all his machinery and only needs to   
 hire a combine harvester. Due to the  
 intense mechanisation he does not     
 employ anyone.                        </content>
