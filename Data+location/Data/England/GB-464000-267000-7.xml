		<title>07FARMING IN EAST HADDON</title>
		<content>East Haddon has a number of small      
farms.These are all very different in  
nature. Most keep cattle and sheep the 
former being divided between dairy and 
beef. There is therefore a             
considerable amount of land given to   
permanent or semi permanent grassland. 
Arable land is used either for winter  
grain production or root crops such as 
potatoes.                              
The chicken farm on Ravensthorpe Rd is 
engaged inthe rearing of imported day  
old chicks. Birds are then taken away  
by lorry.                              
Several of the farms have a small hobby
collection of animals. This is due to  
the influence of the rare breeds       
collection at nearby Holdenby House.   
It is therefore common to see Jacob's  
sheep in fields together with donkeys.
