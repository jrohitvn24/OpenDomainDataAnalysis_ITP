 There are few white collar workers in 
 the area.                             
 The majority of men who are in work   
 are involved in manual or semi-skilled
 jobs.                                 
 Many married women are forced to work 
 either to supplement their husband's  
 wage or because their husbands are    
 unemployed.                           
 Many young people are out of work and 
 for those leaving school the prospects
 of employment are not promising.      
                                       
 "The unemployment situation is a      
 dreadful state of affairs. 11 years   
 ago in this area there were very many 
 people going to work. Now you only see
 a few people in the mornings. At one  
 time young people felt sure about     
 getting a job. It's not so easy in    
 1985. " (Local Parish Priest)...../   </content>
