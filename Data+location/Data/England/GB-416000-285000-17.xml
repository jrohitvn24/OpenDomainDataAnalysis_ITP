		<title>17Attitudes</title>
		<content> People answered a questionnaire about 
 their attitudes to seven issues and   
 the results are summarised below;     
   93% thought that the shopping       
 facilities in the area are good.      
   There were three issues with 75%    
 agreement, religion was unimprotant in
 their lives, the bus service in the   
 area is good and parents should       
 support teachers and schools in the   
 education of children.                
   Half of the people thought that the 
 area was unattractive, that the area  
 did not have a good community spirit  
 and that the police do a good job.    
 With these last three issues about a  
 third of the people could not make up 
 their minds so the number who         
 disagreed with these attitudes is     
 small.                                
                                       
                                       </content>
