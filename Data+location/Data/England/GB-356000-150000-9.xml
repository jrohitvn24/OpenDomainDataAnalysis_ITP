		<title>09BUILDING MATERIALS</title>
		<content>    In this area the building materials
 used are often quite different from   
 those employed in nearby Bristol or   
 Bath.                                 
    Local stone has long been quarried 
 and used to build Mendip cottages and 
 houses. Where builders employed lime  
 mortar and lime washes,stone surrounds
 were often used to frame windows.     
 Stone mullion windows are a common    
 feature, with lead used to seal the   
 glass to the stone.                   
    A lot of the roofs in this area are
 covered by clay tiles. The school at  
 the centre of Chewton Mendip is a good
 example (597,531). Some of the best   
 examples of slate roofs on traditional
 cottages are along the Folly          
 (596,527). Slate, for many years has  
 been quarried in South Wales and      
 bought back by boat or road to        
 England.                              </content>
