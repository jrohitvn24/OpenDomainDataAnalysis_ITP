		<content>   Guthlac was born in the year 673    
 A.D. He was a son of a noble family   
 related to the royal house of Mercia. 
 He grew up to be a wild young man,    
 leading a band of his friends in a    
 life of fighting.When he was 24 he    
 suddenly repented of his life and     
 vowed that he would become God's      
 servant.He became a monk.He entered   
 the double monastary-nunnery in       
 Derbyshire at Repton,under Abess      
 Aelfthrytha and he studied for two    
 years.He longed for solitude and a    
 more austere life.So in 699 he asked  
 permission to leave with two          
 followers.He came to a large area of  
 fens that at that time separated      
 Mercia from East Anglia.              
   Guthlac lived like a hermit there   
 until he died at 41 years of age,in   
 714.
