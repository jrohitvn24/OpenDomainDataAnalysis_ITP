		<content> The present church, which is the third
 church on the same site, was built in 
 1886 so it will be a hundred years old
 next year.The tower was built in the  
 twelve hundreds.The bells were put in 
 the tower in 1840.The bells in the    
 tower are made of cast steel.We think 
 that a London Foundry made them and   
 put them there.The oldest stained     
 glass window is in the west end of the
 tower, the next oldest after that     
 dates from 1879.The font is Norman it 
 is about 900 hundred years old.The    
 first organ was installed in 1935 and 
 another one, after that, which is     
 electric was installed in 1978.The    
 pulpit was built with the present     
 church in 1888.The furniture with the 
 carved mice has been there since      
 the first World War.The flags have    
 been there since just after the First 
 World War.                            </content>
