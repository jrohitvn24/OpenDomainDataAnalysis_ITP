Most of the people living in the       
village of Great Doddington don't go to
church. There is a Church of England   
building and a United Reformed Chapel. 
There is a resident vicar but the      
clergy serving the chapel are shared   
with Wellingborough. There is a Sunday 
School connected with the church which 
meets in the Village Hall and one that 
meets in a side room of the chapel. The
church has its own choir and is served 
by a council of local people. Each year
both institutions hold fund-raising    
activities to raise money for the      
upkeep of their premises. A Harvest    
Festval is held by each in the         
beginning of October of each year.     
Funeral services are held at both      
buildings and some people are still    
interred in the village cemetery.
