		<title>19Transport in St.Helens</title>
		<content> The main form of transport in         
 St.Helens is the bus.In 1985 a new bus
 station has opened.Most of the buses  
 are single-decker ones,the driver     
 collects the fares as you get on.They 
 travel to all parts of the town at    
 least twice an hour.We can visit      
 others towns by bus.At least once an  
 hour to Liverpool,Manchester,Wigan and
 Warrington.                           
   Another way of going to these places
 is by train,although to travel further
 afield we have to change trains at the
 main line stations.                   
   The town is surrounded by motorways.
 It takes half an hour to enter the    
 motorway system and so most of        
 industry use lorries to transport     
 their goods.
