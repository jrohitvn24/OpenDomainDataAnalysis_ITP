 existed in Witley since the seventh   
 century. The oldest part of the church
 is the{Nave.}In the stone walls are   
 two original Saxon windows.Over the   
 centuries,other parts have been added.
   When you walk into the church,you   
 suddenly feel cold because of the     
 stone.There is a lovely polished      
 smell.You can see the{font.}This is   
 an octagonal shape and dates from the 
 thirteenth century.There are wonderful
 stained glass windows.On the walls are
 twelfth century{wall paintings }which 
 were uncovered in 1889.The paintings  
 were put on to wet plaster.In         
 1917,conservation work caused the     
 paintings to darken and blister.The   
 paintings show episodes from the life 
 of Jesus.Inside the church,there are  
 three graves dating from about 1200.
