		<content> DURING 1985 A NEW GRANITE ALTAR       
 WAS INSTALLED IN THE CHURCH.THE TOP   
 WEIGHS 1200lbs AND EACH LEG WEIGHS    
 ABOUT 200lbs. THE OLD ALTAR WAS MADE  
 OF WOOD NOT GRANITE.                  
 THE ALTAR WAS MADE BY TWO LOCAL       
 QUARRIES, HANTERGANTICK AND DELANK.   
 HANTERGANTICK MADE THE LEGS AND       
 DELANK MADE THE TOP.ON EACH CORNER OF 
 THE ALTAR AND IN THE MIDDLE THERE IS A
 CROSS.TO GET THE ALTAR INSIDE THEY HAD
 TO TAKE THE DOOR OF THE CHURCH OFF    
 IT'S HINGES. THE DOORS ARE  VERY THICK
 AND WEIGH QUITE A BIT.                
 THE NEW ALTAR WAS CONSECRATED ON 9TH  
 SEPTEMBER BY THE RT.REV. PETER        
 MUMFORD, BISHOP OF TRURO AT A SPECIAL 
 SERVICE AT WHICH A LARGE PROPORTION OF
 THE VILLAGE COMMUNITY, INCLUDING THE  
 MEN WHO HAD WORKED ON THE ALTAR, WERE 
 PRESENT.                              
                                       </content>
