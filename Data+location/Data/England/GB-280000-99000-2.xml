   Crediton is a town of approximately 
 6,000 people. It is situated between  
 two hills on the main route from      
 Exeter to Barnstaple. In the summer   
 Crediton benefits and suffers from the
 flow of{holiday-makers}through its    
 high street.                          
   There are two County Primary, one   
 private (preparatory) and one         
 Comprehensive{school}for the 11-19    
 range.                                
   Crediton's{shops}cater for most of  
 the needs of its inhabitants and those
 who live in the surrounding           
 countryside.                          
   A good deal of{employment}is        
 available in local industries, but    
 many people work in Exeter.           
   There was a{settlement}at Crediton  
 in{Saxon}times. It is thought to have 
 been the birth-place of St. Boniface.}</content>
