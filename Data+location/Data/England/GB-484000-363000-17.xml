		<content> The roads within the area are         
 administered by Lincolnshire County   
 Council to the east and               
 Nottinghamshire Couty Council to the  
 west.The county boundary runs almost  
 half way through the area from north  
 to south.All roads are Class B minor  
 routes.They are covered with a top    
 surface of crushed gravel.Notts. roads
 have centre white line markings,while 
 Lincs roads only have markings at     
 junctions etc.Although the road       
 surface in Lincs remains quite good   
 verge grass cutting and snow clearance
 in winter has suffered over the past  
 few years through cuts in capital     
 expenditure.Nottinghamshire with less 
 cuts have come off better and their   
 routes tend to be in a better state of
 repair.
