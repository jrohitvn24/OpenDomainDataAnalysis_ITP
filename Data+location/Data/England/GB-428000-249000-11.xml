		<content>{Mrs. J. Wheildon of Mill Cottage      
 Butlers Marston has written of these  
 recollections:                        
 "I came to the district as a land girl
 in 1941.I lodged at Little Kineton and
 travelled every day on my bicycle to  
 Morelands farm in the parish of       
 Butlers Marston.There I learnt to milk
 by hand,look after suckled calves,feed
 pigs and help with hay-making and     
 harvest.Hay-making meant taking hay to
 ricks,and harvesting was "stooking"   
 the corn,carrying again to a rick and 
 helping to build it,a craftsman's job,
 and hard work in the heat of          
 summer.The farm workers were craftsmen
 each with his own speciality -        
 -horseman,hedge-cutter,cowman,        
 shepherd,but all helped at harvest    
 time.The workers came to work on      
 bikes,or walked each day across       
 fields."                              </content>
