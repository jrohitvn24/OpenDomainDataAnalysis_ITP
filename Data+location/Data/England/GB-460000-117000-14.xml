		<title>14Farming Droxford,Footpaths</title>
		<content> My Dad is a farmer.Our farm is called 
 Bushy Down Farm.It covers 706 acres,  
 655 acres are arable.The crops are    
 wheat,barley and oil seed rape.Peas   
 and tick beans are break crops to give
 the ground a rest.We keep about 70    
 beef cattle and 100 fat lambs are kept
 from Oct till Feb.This year we have   
 built a new shed and bought a sprayer.
 I have a new sister,all the other     
 babies born this year in Droxford have
 been boys.Late July lots of rain but  
 our crops are not to spoilt.{Class 3} 
 surveyed the 4 south squares of grid. 
 Most footpaths were clear with stiles 
 or kissing gates.The best path wasn't 
 clear it went across a field or ripe  
 barley,we followed a tractor wheel    
 trail.The village people like the     
 downs,river and Beech walk;new trees  
 have been planted.The{Wayfarers' walk}
 crosses Droxford.                     </content>
