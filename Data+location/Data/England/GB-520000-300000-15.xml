		<content> The{New Ark Play Association}has been 
 going for 12 years but it has moved   
 three times.Where it is now it has    
 been there for 5 years. It has an     
 adventure playground which children   
 from 5_16 years old can use.It is     
 mostly made from wood and tyres. It   
 has a swing and lots of climbing      
 frames. They also have lots of pieces 
 of wood so you can build yourself a   
 den. They also have chickens and ducks
 so the children can feed them and look
 after them. You can do art and craft  
 too, like making masks and pots. Lots 
 of people like to do some printing    
 too. There is also a kitchen so you   
 can do some cooking and make cakes.   
 The play group is owned by the New Ark
 Play Association. They have an Urban  
 Aid grant to help pay for things that 
 they need.
