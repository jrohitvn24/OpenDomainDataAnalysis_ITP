		<title>09THE COMMUNITY OF CALF HEATH</title>
		<content>The newer inhabitants of the modernised
homes invariably travel many miles to  
work and with the children travelling  
to school by coach the village is      
deserted during the day.The sad result 
of this seems to be a definite lack of 
community spirit and friendship usually
found in a village of this size.The    
limited bus service to the local town  
of Cannock is now very poorly used and 
in danger of being axed completely.This
of course would mean considerable hard-
ship to the older people who rely on   
this service to reach the shops and    
doctor etc.Similarly the combined post 
office and general store is also very  
little used and cannot be a viable     
proposition for much longer.The fine   
village hall is used mainly for private
functions such as wedding receptions   
and buffet dances.
