		<content> Until 1962 the woods were privately   
 owned, but the land has now been div_ 
 ided into several holdings which are  
 managed by Economic Forestry, in re_  
 turn for which the owner receives Gov_
 ernment Grant Aid.  Most of the area  
 is now stocked woodland, 66% broad-   
 leaved &amp; mixed, &amp; 34% conifer forest. 
 The plantings of the early 1960s have 
 now reached the thinning stage &amp; are  
 ready for harvesting.  Many varieties 
 of trees were sown but the most succ_ 
 essful have been Corsican pines, Jap_ 
 anese &amp; European larch, Western red   
 cedar, Sitka spruce, Douglas fir &amp;    
 beech.  The natural trees are beech,  
 ash, birch, some oak, cherry,sycamore,
 yew and holly.  The most serious      
 threat to all these trees is damage   
 from deer, grey squirrels &amp; voles,    
 necessitating in particular, intensive
 squirrel control.                     </content>
