		<title>10RESIDENT OF COFFINSWELL.</title>
		<content> The name Coffinswell has come from a  
 man called Caffrins who owned many    
 willas(villas).Caffrins-willa became  
 Coffinswell.The cottages in the       
 village are all approximately 400     
 years old though the oldest is 600    
 years old.There are approximately 30  
 children in the village,the number has
 decreased throughout the years.The    
 villagers main shops are in           
 Newton-Abbot and Torquay,although in  
 earlier years there would have been   
 shops in the village.When the         
 villagers run out of important foods  
 there is a man who delivers it to the 
 villagers.There is a tree surgeon in  
 the village,but the proper doctor is  
 in Kingskerswell.The main leisure     
 activity is looking at the wonderful  
 views,although there is a Craft Club  
 and a small church in the village
