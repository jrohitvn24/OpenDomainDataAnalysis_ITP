		<title>10DANGER FROM LIMESTONE</title>
		<content>  In our area there are many limestone 
 shafts which are very dangerous. The  
 limestone has been quarried for       
 hundreds of years for use in the metal
 industry. Some of the roads on top of 
 the shafts have collapsed. Recently in
 Hill Road near the Foundry, there were
 some men who were drilling down to    
 check the limestone. Sometimes the    
 shafts are filled with waste materials
 and then have a cap put across the top
 of them. There are so many shafts in  
 our area that have not been mapped    
 properly that there is always a danger
 of further collapse taking place.
