		<title>06THE MINERS STRIKE 1984</title>
		<content> Every Saturday morning my dad and I   
 got up at 7 o'clock and caught the 2  
 minutes past 8 bus. We had to wait for
 about an hour. The people who gave out
 the food parcels also ran soup        
 kitchens with the help of some others.
 The soup kitchens were only for the   
 miners. There were a lot of people    
 pleased to help the miners. At        
 Christmas the people gave presents to 
 the children. The miners children had 
 parties at Moorends. We had a         
 Christmas party and got 3 presents    
 each. The 15-17 year olds got Â£5 each.
 We also had a trip to Scarborough in  
 June. There were 12 buses and we got  
 sweets,crisps and Â£5 each. We set off 
 at 8a.m. and came back at 8.30p.m.. We
 are glad that the strike is over now. 
   When the miners strike began we did 
 not really suffer. We were getting a  
 lot more than some people.            </content>
