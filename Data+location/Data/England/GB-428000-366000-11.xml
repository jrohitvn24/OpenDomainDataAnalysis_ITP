		<content> Within the farming families, the wives
 take an active part in the running of 
 the farm in addition to caring for the
 home and the family needs. During     
 harvest time and lambing all the      
 family help with the work encouraging 
 a close knit family unit. All have 6  
 miles to travel to comprehensive      
 shpping centres and the children are  
 taken to school by special buses.     
 In the winter it is necessary to stock
 up with supplies and food for both the
 family and livestock. Well stocked    
 kitchen gardens provide vegetables    
 and soft fruit, the surplus being     
 preserved by bottling or freezing.    
{AMMENITIES:-}all have the telephone.  
 All have electricity, but one. This   
 uses bottled gas for cooking and      
 parafin for light. Spring water is    
 piped and sanitation depends on       
 cesspits or septic tanks.             </content>
