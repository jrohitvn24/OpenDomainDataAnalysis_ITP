		<title>01Introduction to Aston</title>
		<content>  The present Aston has developed      
 around 4 old villages.Originally it   
 was a{rural community}centred around  
 the{HALL and CHURCH,but MINING in the 
{area}led to changes in the community. 
   After the{M1}was built,25 years     
 ago,a great deal of new housing and   
 businesses have sprung up.The new     
 families have placed a strain on the  
 limited{SHOPPING,WELFARE and LEISURE  
{facilities.                           
   The{M1}led to a tremendous increase 
 in traffic through Aston to Sheffield.
 This has decreased since the{BY-PASS  
 was completed in 1985.                
  {Today,Aston is a suburb of Sheffield
{and Rotherham}with a population of    
 over 15,000.New housing is still being
 built but little in the way of        
 facilities is being provided apart    
 from a recent new Primary School      
 bringing the total to 8 schools.      </content>
