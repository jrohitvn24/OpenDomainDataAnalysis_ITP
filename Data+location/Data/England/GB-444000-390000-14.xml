		<content> Wickersley road is one of the oldest  
 roads in Rotherham,but one year all   
 the trees caught Dutch Elm disease,and
 all the trees had to be cut           
 down.wickersley road starts at the    
 Brecks and carrys on down till it     
 changes to Wellgate,and carrys on     
 through town.                         
 East Bawtry road starts right out at  
 Maltby and goes right down past       
 Whiston traffic lights and carrys on  
 to M.F.I,Furnishing World and         
 Wickes.Bawtry road is partly a dual   
 carriage way.If you go further up the 
 road there is a secondary school.There
 is a foot bridge for the children to  
 cross the road but not many of them   
 use it because it is not very good    
 because it takes to long to climb     
 up the steps and down again.
