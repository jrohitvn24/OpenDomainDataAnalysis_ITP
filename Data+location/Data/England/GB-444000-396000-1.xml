		<content>   We are lucky to live in our habitat.
 The scenery is varied.  The centre of 
{Rawmarsh}is residential and it gets   
 less residential as it stretches out  
 to the boundaries of our area.  It is 
 mostly countryside near the boundaries
 but some of the land near our         
 boundaries is residential.  The       
 unemployment is great.  Many people   
 have no jobs but could do well in the 
 works we used to have, like coal      
 mining and steel industries.  Many    
 coal mines have run out of coal, and  
 steel is being imported from foreign  
 countries because it is much cheaper  
 to make there.  There are some        
 factories moving to our area, which   
 are new, modern ones. {The British    
{Waterways Board}has restored          
 the{South Yorkshire Navigation}that   
 runs through{Swinton and Rotherham}and
 we hope it will help new industries.  </content>
