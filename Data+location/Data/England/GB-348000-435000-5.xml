		<title>05Station Lane, Barton</title>
		<content>Station Lane has been known at various 
times as Carter's Lane, School Lane,   
Cobbett's Lane and Boggart House Lane. 
                                       
John Carter was priest at the Catholic 
chapel of St Lawrence at Newhouse from 
1745-89. St Mary's chapel was built in 
1806 and the present church was built  
in 1906 at the expense of William Smith
of Newsham House.                      
                                       
The name Cobbett dates from the visit  
of the Radical candidate in the        
Preston election of 1826 to Barton and 
his discussions with the parish priest.
                                       
A carving of a boggart or sprite can be
seen over the door of Boggart's Farm   
opposite the school.                   
                                       
Station lane crosses the railway by the
old station, now used as a house.      </content>
