		<title>01Description of our area</title>
		<content>     We are a four by three kilometre  
 patch.There is one primary school in  
 our area, with four houses            
 nearby.There is one                   
 garage serving our area and there are 
 no shops except for a mini-market     
 at the filling station in             
 Trevennen.There are some mobile       
 deliveries which travel round the     
 district.There are two council estates
 one at Gweek and one at Trewennack.   
     Most of our area is farmland.It is
 a mixture of permanent pasture and    
 arable land.Most of the farms are     
 dairy farms.The surrounding           
 countryside has a few scattered       
 houses.There are several steep hills  
 leading away from Boskenwyn           
 Downs.There are tree lined lanes and  
 several wooded sections.
