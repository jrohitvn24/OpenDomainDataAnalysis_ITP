To the east of our area is a place     
called Crown Point. Here people take   
walks and admire the view across the   
whole of Burnley and beyond, as it is  
quite a high hill (about 340m above sea
level). They often drive up here on a  
Sunday afternoon and park their car    
before going for a stroll.             
                                       
Just to the north of Crown Point is a  
Golf Course, occupying about 2/3 km^2. 
                                       
On the A56 there are two public houses 
to which people drive from quite a     
distance at the weekend, or in the     
evening.                               
                                       
There are also several pubs in the     
built-up area, but these tend to be    
used much more by "locals".
