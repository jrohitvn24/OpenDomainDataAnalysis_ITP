		<content> Knivetonwood Farm is a typical local  
 farm.It covers about one hundred acres
 of land.There are 35 fields.          
 The farm is really a dairy farm       
 although recently the farmer has      
 started to keep more sheep and        
 lambs.He has had to sell some cows to 
 cut down on milk production. The cows 
 produce about 7000 litres of milk per 
 week which is collected by bulk       
 tanker.                               
 There are over 200 animals on the farm
 of which 40 are sheep and 60 are      
 lambs. The cows are Friesians and     
 Herefords and there are six Limousin  
 bulls.
