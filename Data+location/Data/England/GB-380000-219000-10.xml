		<title>10Night Nursing-Gloucester</title>
		<content>      I work at night on the{post-natal
 wards at the Gloucester Royal         
 Hospital.When I get to the ward at    
 8.20pm I receive a report on each     
 patient who is in my care.After we do 
 a general ward round and get the Mums 
 comfortable for the night with        
 supplies of nappies ,bottles of milk  
 or water.                             
     We then pay attention to the Mums 
 who are having trouble with their     
 babies eg.poor feeders,underweight    
 babies and Mums who have had          
 operations.Also during the night other
 Mums are admitted and babies born.    
     At 6.00am all are woken and made  
 ready for the day.Sometimes during the
 night we  get an hour break,sometimes 
 as last night we had 23 Mums and 24   
 babies.There was just time for a quick
 snack.I left work at 7.45am.
