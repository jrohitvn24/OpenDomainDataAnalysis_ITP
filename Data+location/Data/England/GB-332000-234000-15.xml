		<title>15LAW AND ORDER</title>
		<content>   The law and order in our village    
 consists of a small police station    
 which is part of the West Mercia      
 Constabulary. This station covers a   
 number of villages and each policeman 
 visits our station although it is not 
 manned 24 hours a day. At the station 
 there are cells to hold any prisoners.
   The Magistrates Court is over the   
 road from the Police Station. The     
 Court meets every other Monday,       
 sometimes it sits at night for serious
 cases such as drugs. Instead of a jury
 there are three Justices of the Peace.
