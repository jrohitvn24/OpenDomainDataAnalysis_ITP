 advertisements. These include car

 contains approximately two pages on   
 property sales. You can also sell your
 own possessions and send greetings and
 messages. The paper contains things   
 such as local news sports and         
 weddings. Puzzles and games and t.v.

 there is a page for collectable       
 antiques.
