		<title>09The Town Clerk of Brackley</title>
		<content>   We interviewed Mr. Wheatcroft who is
Brackley's Town Clerk. A Town Clerk has
to run the administration of the town. 
Mr. Wheatcroft is responsible for the  
Town Hall, open spaces and greens, the 
lake, cemetaries, the Park, fairs and  
the Market Place. He is also concerned 
about keeping Brackley clean. He said  
that he felt a sense of achievement as 
it had finally been decided that       
Brackley should have a bypass; he has  
wanted this to happen for a long time. 
   His official robes are a horse hair 
wig, doctor's "tabs", a black robe and 
white gloves. His wig has to be sent   
away sometimes to be cleaned. This     
costs between ten and fifteen pounds.  
   Although he did not grow up in      
Brackley, Mr. Wheatcroft likes the town
very much. He wanted to be Town Clerk  
because he could change things and have
responsibility.                        </content>
