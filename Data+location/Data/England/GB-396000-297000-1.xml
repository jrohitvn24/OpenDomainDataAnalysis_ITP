		<content> Our square covers part of the         
 following districts.                  
 Willenhall,Bentley,Darlaston, all in  
 the borough of Walsall. The area has  
 many industrial outlets, many still   
 associated with metal industries.     
  Features of the local landscape would
 include large new housing estatea,    
 areas of Victorian housing.Sites of   
 industrial dereliction,some of which  
 are now being landscaped by the local 
 council. The M6 motorway runs through 
 the square, this is always a source of
 traffic congestion,noise, and         
 pollution.                            
  Schools contributing to the          
 information on this square are Alum   
 well, Pinfold Street,Noose Lane,King  
 Charles,Rough Hay,St. Giles.These are 
 all Junior Schools. Jane Lane Special 
 School also helped with the project.
