		<title>09THE FERRY AT HAMPTON LOADE 2</title>
		<content> There is a main wire going from one   
 side of the river to the other.Another
 wire goes from this via the pulley to 
 the boat.A third wire goes from this  
 wire to the front of the boat.There is
 a rudder that they steer the boat with
 by hand.It is the force of the river  
 current against this rudder which     
 enables the boat to float across.     
     As you go across the river you can
 sometimes see lots of wildlife such as
 otters,kingfishers and ducks.Sometimes
 you can see the occasional mink.In the
 Summer time there are lots of weeds   
 which slow the river down and the     
 ferry sometimes gets stuck.Someone has
 to wade in and cut the weeds          
 down.There are also different species 
 of fish including                     
 barbel,trout,perch,carp,minnow and    
 eel.
