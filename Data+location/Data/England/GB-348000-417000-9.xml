		<content> The rivers flowing through the area   
 are the{Lostock, Yarrow and Sydbrook. 
 The most{badly polluted}is the        
{Sydbrook.}The river Yarrow becomes    
 more polluted as it flows through     
 Croston. Near to the{sewage works     
 traces of salt and oil were found in  
 the water with some solid material.   
 The river Lostock had a{clear bright  
 appearance. In the river no trace of  
 solid material was found.             
 The{noise pollution}level in the      
 centre of Croston is high. Many large 
 commercial vehicles use the A581 as a 
{route between Liverpool and the M6    
{motorway.
