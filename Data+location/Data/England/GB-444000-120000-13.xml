		<title>13TYPICAL DAY OF A 15 YR.OLD</title>
		<content> I usually get up at 7a.m..I wash and  
 put on my uniform and go downstairs.  
 While eating my cornflakes, I watch   
 'T.V.A.M.'on television. Having       
 cleaned my teeth and sorted my school 
 books out, I get my bike out and cycle
 to school, which starts at 8.55.      
 During the day, I will go to my locker
 several times to change my books and  
 equipment. At 11.55, we have lunch-   
 break. I usually eat sandwiches, a    
 pork pie, crisps, and a chocolate bar.
 I usually have a drink at morning and 
 afternoon break. At 3.35 school ends  
 and if I do not have an afternoon club
 I go home. I watch Television for a   
 while, then do my homework for a      
 couple of hours. I have my dinner and 
 watch television again. Finally I go  
 for a run, have a shower and go to bed
 at about 9.30p.m.                     
                                       </content>
