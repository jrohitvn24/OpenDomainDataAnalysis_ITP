		<title>12A Girl's School Outing Part2</title>
		<content> We ran to Sarah Mobsby's house Miss   
 Long phoned from there we got a lift  
 from Mrs Manville,she took us back and
 then we went home.When I got home I   
 got dressed into my playing clothes   
 and went to call for Tina but she was 
 not in.

 My mum looked out of the window when  
 she heard voices.She almost fell over 
 in surprise when she saw us come in at
 the gate.Mum opened the door and we   
 all came pouring in,"how many of you  
 are there," she said,me in the middle 
 of it all said,"the whole class." Mum 
 gave out towels .Me the lucky one     
 could change. After about ten  minutes
 they all got back to school apart from
 me because I did not go back to       
 school.That was our outing in the     
 rain.
