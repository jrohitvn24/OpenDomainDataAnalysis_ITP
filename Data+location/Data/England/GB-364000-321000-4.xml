		<title>04SHOPPING</title>
		<content> On the 4th July 1985 we went to Bolas 
 and did a survey on shopping.We had   
 quite a selection of answers,the      
 answers varied from different towns   
 and counties.Most people go to        
 Wolverhampton to do there shopping.   
 Wolverhampton is 40km south_east of   
 Bolas,there nearest shop is in        
 Waters_upton which is 2km south_west  
 of Bolas.We asked them if they would  
 like a shop nearer to them they said  
 yes it would be more convenient some  
 said no because there would be to much
 trouble if there was a shop any nearer
 to them.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
