		<title>05THORNDON COUNTRY PARK 2</title>
		<content>   The park is divided into two areas, 
 the larger Forest area to the NW and  
 the smaller open area around Octagonal
 Plantation in the SE.The two areas are
 connected by a footpath running       
 alongside the Thorndon Hall           
 Golf Course providing views of Hatch  
 Farm and across the Thames Estuary    
 Plain. Access to the park is either   
 through the gates at Lion Lodge, off  
 The Avenue, or from the slip road off 
 Ingrave Road north of the Halfway     
 House junction to the Arterial Road.  
 There are many woodland walks, through
 mature deciduous and pine forest.     
 Fishing is available in the Old Hall  
 Pond and there are a number of picnic 
 areas, especially in the southern part
 of the park where fresh water is      
 available from free-standing taps,    
 and barbecues can be set up too.
