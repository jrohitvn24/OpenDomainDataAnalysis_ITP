		<content> Sandal Church is dedicated to         
{St.Helen.}The first patron of the     
 church was Edward the Confessor. In   
 the first{Domesday Book}there were two
 churches in Wakefield of which Sandal 
 was one. In the year 1150 a new church
 was built in the shap of a cross. In  
 the year of the{Black Death 1349}the  
 church was rebuilt.The next thing to  
 be added was a Chantry Chapel. In 1872
 the church was lengthened by two bays 
 to the west, the south porch was taken
 down and the north door was replaced  
 by a  three light window.In 1895 a    
 small chapel was built and consecrated
 by{William Walsham Howe,}the first    
 Bishop of Wakefield.On the reredos is 
 carved the Last Supper.The credence   
 table is made of olive wood from the  
 Mount of Olives.The present day vicar 
 is Mr.Strapps.
