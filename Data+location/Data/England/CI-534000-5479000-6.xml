 and the shop is in Church Road ,St    
 Sampson's.The business involves       
 making bed bases and mattresses,and is
 owned by English men living on the    
 island.They employ fifteen people     
 and produce 15 to 20 beds a day.At    
 present they import all their         
 materials, and export 75% of their    
 output.They make 13 different         
 qualities of mattresses. In the       
 standard range the quilted are cheaper
 than the tufted mattresses. There are 
 two different materials used to cover 
 a mattress and 15 different patterns  
 of material.The company have produced 
 such good results that they are about 
 to expand and have built another      
 warehouse behind the shop where they  
 are to make their own headboards and  
 springs.
