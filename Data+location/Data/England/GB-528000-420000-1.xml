		<title>01PARTINGTON</title>
		<content> Patrington is situated 4 miles W. of  
 the North Sea coast and 17 miles E. of
 Hull.It was mentioned in the Domesday 
 book as{PATRICTONE}and from Saxon     
 times to the Reformation belonged to  
 the Archbishops of York.Today the     
 village is slowly expanding as new    
 housing is replacing some of the      
 derelict parts.For example the site of
 the old workhouse is being developed  
 as a private residential area.About 2 
 miles S. of the village lies the      
 hamlet of Patrington Haven which as   
 its name suggests aws once joined to  
 the Humber.Here a Leisure Park has    
 been opened to attract holidaymakers  
 to the area.The village church of St. 
 Patrick's,known locally as the Queen  
 of Holderness dominates the area.
