		<content> Tedburn St. Mary lies in beautiful    
 countryside which is mainly given over
 to pasture land; the contours of the  
 undulating landscape, on average,     
 range between 100m and 200m.          
                                       
 The largest stand of trees is Oldridge
 wood. Several other plantations and   
 copses exist especially along the     
 courses of the river Ted and          
 Lillybrook.                           
                                       
 Several present day farms were        
 Domesday Manors. Examples are Great   
 Hackworthy and Uppacott. Some field   
 patterns which suggest the            
 characteristic open medieval field    
 patterns which were laid out in       
 strips, are evident in the vicinity of
 Uppacott.
