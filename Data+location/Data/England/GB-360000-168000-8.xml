		<title>08Recreation in Knowle</title>
		<content> The{Knowle area of Bristol}provides a 
 number of facilites for recreation,   
 some private clubs and others public. 
 The largest is the{Imperial Sports }  
{Ground}founded in 1904 by the famous  
 tobacco manufacturing family of{Wills 
 for the use of their employees. It has
 been so successful that larger        
 pavilions are now being built. There  
 are football and rugby pitches, indoor
 squash courts and, most widely known, 
 a cricket club. The high standard of  
 facilities allows County teams to play
 here and great consternation was      
 caused when it seemed that new ring   
 road plans might affect the grounds.  
{Knowle cricket and tennis clubs}form  
 another important private area for the
 sports people of Knowle.{Redcatch Park
 however, has swings and slides for    
 local youngsters, bowling greens for  
 adults and relaxation for all.        </content>
