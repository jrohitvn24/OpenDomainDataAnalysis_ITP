 Account by MATTHEW ROSE  age 10       
  My father's name is Brendon Rose. He 
 does not work in the village so he has
 to drive to Andover.            The   
 firm he works for is Martin Thomas. It
 sells aluminium scaffolding. He has to
 go to sort out problems for other     
 depots in Bristol and Sheffield..     
  He sometimes has to show people      
 around  and he also has to go to      
 exhibitions.  He writes leaflets about
 the scaffolding that he sells.        
   For his leisure he goes sailing. We 
 go to Southampton because we keep our 
 boat there.We have got an outboard    
 motor for our dinghy. We usually go to
 the Isle of Wight for a weekend.
