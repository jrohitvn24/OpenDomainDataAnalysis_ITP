		<title>14The Scores</title>
		<content>Until the 18th. century extensive      
denes, on which sheep grazed, divided  
Corton cliffs from the sea. These denes
were reached by scores, paths cut      
through the cliffs, of which two,      
Baker's and Tibbenham's, remain.       
 Tibbenham's Score takes its name from 
John Tibbenham who owned some nearby   
land in about 1800, and Baker's Score, 
formerly Corton Score, was called after
 a 19th. century blacksmith who made it
navigable for carts to bring shingle   
from the beach. A much older score on  
th site, named Jesuim or Holywater, may
have marked the site of a mediaeval    
holy well.
