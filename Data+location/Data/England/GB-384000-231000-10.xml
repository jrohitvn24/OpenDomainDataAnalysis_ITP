		<title>10LEISURE IN FORTHAMPTON</title>
		<content> Leisure is not a major aspect of the  
 conversation of the people in the     
 Forthampton area. This could reflect  
 the age structure of the population   
 with an emphasis towards older people.
 Facilties are very limited locally    
 although there is a small caravan site
 at Lower Lode, the old fording point  
 of the River Severn. There is also a  
 public house and a cafe here as well  
 as mooring for a few motor boats. It  
 is a popular spot for people from     
 Tewkesbury to walk to but has a       
 general air of decay about it.        
 There is a working men's club and a   
 youth club in Forthampton plus a      
 thriving Women's Institute. Each year 
 the youth club holds The Forthampton  
 Fun Run during October attracting some
 150 runners for the 5 mile event, and 
 the Court holds an annual fete during 
 August.                               </content>
