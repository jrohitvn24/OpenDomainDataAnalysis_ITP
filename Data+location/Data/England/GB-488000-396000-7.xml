		<content> (1) Farms and Farm Workers            
 The two villages are very similar in  
 area (approx 2300 acres); 2/3rds of   
 Scotton is farmland and there are 7   
 working farms in the village; in      
 Northorpe an even higher proportion of
 the land is farmed by 6 farmers.      
 Changes in farming practice, higher   
 labour costs and larger machinery mean
 that relatively few people now work on
 the land (probably less than 20       
 Scotton men are now employed full time
 in farming or in work associated with 
 agriculture; one of the largest farms 
 used to employ 21 people).  Farming   
 remains an integral part of the vill- 
 age scene, with tractors, trailers and
 combine harvesters familiar sights on 
 the roads and in the fields: this does
 not prevent the occasional complaint  
 about the noise of corn dryers, mud on
 the road or smoke from straw burning! </content>
