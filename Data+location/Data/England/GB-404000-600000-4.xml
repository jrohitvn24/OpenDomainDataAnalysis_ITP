		<content> A lady who lives by the river owns a  
 piece of land which she is trying to  
 turn into a small nature reserve. It  
 is already full of weeds nettles and  
 ferns but she clears spaces and       
 introduces wild flowers. There are    
 other local people who are interested 
 and they have been cleaning up litter 
 and spreading wild flowers seeds for  
 the future. Along the old railway line
 there are lots of wild flowers,       
 especially at the beginning of the    
 summer.                               
 In the woods near Cragside there are  
 roe and fallow deer which can often be
 seen crossing the road but they are   
 not tame. In the woods there are red  
 squirrels but on the moorland you need
 to be careful because there are       
 adders.                               
                                       
                                       </content>
