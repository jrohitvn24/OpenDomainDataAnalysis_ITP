		<title>15COMMUTING TO WORK</title>
		<content> There  is very little work in the area
 so most people must work elsewhere.   
 Pickford Builders are the only        
 builders in the area.They have a yard 
 in Great Easton.We made a count of all
 the parents who work in and out of the
 area.

 We went around our school and asked   
 the children what their dads do at    
 work.One of them works for the Queen. 
 He is a special detective.One of them 
 is an Anglian waterman.Most of the    
 people who commute to work,work in    
 either London, Bishop's Stortford or  
 Dunmow.                               </content>
