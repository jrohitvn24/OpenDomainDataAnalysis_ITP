		<title>07BESSES O' TH' BARN.</title>
		<content> This area of Whitefield was once a    
 village of the same name. Various     
 legends exist of how the name came    
 about, including one involving Dick   
 Turpin and his horse "Black Bess".    
                                       
 The most reasonable sounding tale is  
 of a local pub which looked like a    
 barn and was run by a lady called     
 Bess. The local invitation to a drink 
 would be, "let's go see Bessie at th' 
 barn. Later, as houses were built     
 around, the name came to mean the     
 whole village, not just the pub.      
                                       
 The spelling of the name has changed  
 slightly. It was once spelt "Bess o'  
 th' Barn". In 1824 both spellings were
 in use: "Bess" in Baines map of       
 Lancashire, and "Besses", as we use it
 today, in Baines Directory.
