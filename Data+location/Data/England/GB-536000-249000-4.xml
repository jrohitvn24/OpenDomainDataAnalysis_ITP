		<title>04Barrington village school</title>
		<content> The village school was first opened in
 1838. Built near the church on part of
 the Glebe land of the vicarage. The   
 school house was thatched . In 1859   
 the building was extended and what is 
 now the school hall was built and     
 roofed with slates. The belfry was    
 also built then and the school bell   
 hung. The school was known as the     
 Barrington National School. In 1902   
 with the passing of the 1902          
 Education Act the school became an    
 elementary school. In 1956 the school 
 was reorganised into infants and      
 juniors and in 1960 an additional     
 classroom was built. In 1969 another  
 two new classrooms were added and this
 is how it stands today. In 1984 the   
 schoolhouse was rethatched with       
 Norfolk reed and in 1985 the hall was 
 retiled with Welsh slates, the belfry 
 repaired &amp; the bell re-instated.      </content>
