		<content> The Cock Inn used to have a Ghost.    
 It used to walk up and down the stairs
 along the corridor above the Pub.     
 Some years ago they got an exorist to 
 get rid of the Ghost but it didn't go 
 very far it went over to the Antique  
 shop!Now it resides in the Antique    
 shop,so the pub got rid of it.It      
 wasn't really a frightening Ghost,it  
 just used to walk around the pub and  
 look after it because it was 517 years
 old. They still get things falling off
 the shelves and doors opening but he's
 gone.
