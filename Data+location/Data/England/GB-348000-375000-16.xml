		<content> 2. HOW MANY VEHICLES STILL TRAVELLED  
 THROUGH HELSBY.                       
 3.CONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE    
 TOTAL VOLUME OF TRAFFIC ON A56 PASSING
 THROUGH HELSBY IF THE M56 HAD NOT BEEN
 BUILT.                                
 THE TRAFFIC SURVEY OF THE MOTORWAY    
 TOOK PLACE ON MONDAY 8TH JULY BETWEEN 
 11.2O AND 11.3O A.M. DURING THAT TIME 
 593 VEHICLES INCLUDING MANY ENORMOUS  
 LORRIES PASSED EAST AND WEST. ON      
 THURSDAY 11TH JULY AT THE SAME TIME A 
 SIMILAR SURVEY WAS DONE FOR TRAFFIC   
 TRAVELLING ALONG THE A56 DURING THIS  
 PERIOD 96 VEHICLES PASSED BY. IT WAS  
 QUITE CLEAR FROM THIS SURVEY THAT THE 
 VAST MAJORITY OF TRAFFIC HAS NOW BEEN 
 TAKEN OFF THE A56 BUT THAT THERE IS   
 STILL QUITE A LOT OF LOCAL TRAFFIC.   
 THE THOUGHT OF ALL THIS TRAFFIC       
 PASSING THROUGH HELSBY IS FRIGHTENING
