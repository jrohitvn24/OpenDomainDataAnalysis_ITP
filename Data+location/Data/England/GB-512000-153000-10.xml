		<title>10The Library in Bookham</title>
		<content> Bookham has the smallest public       
 library in Surrey (679 sq.ft.)but the 
 highest readership in the county, with
 140,268 issues per yr:11.46 borrowings
 for each copy in stock. Most popular  
 choices are travel &amp; biography.       
                                       
 The library, at the corner of Dorking 
 Road and Lower Shott, serves a total  
 population of about 20,000 in Bookham,
 Fetcham and Effingham.                
                                       
 Since the library is now too small a  
 public campaign was mounted to        
 persuade Surrey County Council to move
 it to the redundant school in the     
 centre of Bookham.The school was built
 in the 1860's by the Dawnay family and
 given to the village in care of the   
 Parish Church. The Council has agreed 
 to a change of use but no date has yet
 been agreed for the move.             </content>
