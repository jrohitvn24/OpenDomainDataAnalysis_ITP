		<title>07LIFESTYLE-TINTINHULL</title>
		<content>  Since 1904 Tintinhull has greatly    
 changed.It is now 4 times larger and  
 not so pretty.It used to have many    
 apple orchards from which cider was   
 made.                                 
 The men worked on the farms and the   
 glove factories and home machines     
 catered for the women.                
 As transport was difficult and there  
 were not many sources of news,people  
 were apt to pry.                      
 Mrs Noon remembers the first car she  
 saw.It was a Ford and the driver gave 
 her a lift.By 1926 there were 3 cars  
 in Tintinhull.                        
 The great day of the year was         
 Tintinhull Club Day,when the villagers
 visited the farms,had a meal in the   
 Parish Hall and then a dance was held.
 It was organised by the Blue Marine   
 Club.Mrs Noon's father was secretary.
