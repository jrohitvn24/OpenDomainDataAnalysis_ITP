 The 120 acre estate, mostly under     
 farming, was purchased for around     
 Â£17,000 in 1946 by the Diocese, to    
 become the College of St. Hugh - a    
 junior seminary, preparing boys and   
 young men for the Roman Catholic      
 priesthood. The staff included        
 priests, devoted Franciscan sisters   
 and lately, sisters from the Holy     
 Family of Nazareth Order, backed by   
 lay staff. By the late 1960's the     
 number of church students declined.   
 Admitting Catholic lay boys with no   
 particular vocation in mind, the      
 college became a private school       
 supplying one quarter of the diocesan 
 priests. The number of pupils dropped 
 to under 90, and in July 1985, it was 
 decided to close the school after one 
 more academic year.
