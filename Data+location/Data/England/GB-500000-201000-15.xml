		<title>15MICHAEL AND DOREEN MUSKETT</title>
		<content>      Michael and Doreen Muskett are a 
 husband-and-wife team who have built  
 up a large collection of historical   
 musical instruments. They have nearly 
 300 instruments, some of which are    
 originals and some of which are       
 careful reproductions.                
      They live in Bovingdon,but travel
 around the country giving concerts.   
 These concerts are either based on one
 particular historical period or to    
 show the development of particular    
 instruments. They came to our school  
 and gave us a concert called 'Flutes, 
 Reeds and Whistles'.                  
      They travel around in a special  
 motor-caravan which has been specially
 modified to store all their valuable  
 instruments.
