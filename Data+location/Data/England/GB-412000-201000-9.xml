		<title>09LOCAL TRANSPORT FACILITIES</title>
		<content>   On account of its rural nature, the 
 area is not particularly well served  
 by{public transport}and a car is      
 almost a necessity.  There is a       
 limited daily bus service from        
 Cirencester to Swindon, which passes  
 through Fairford, run by Stroud Valley
 Coach Co. but National Coaches        
 travelling to London can only be      
 picked up at these places.  A local   
 coach firm provides a service for     
 shoppers from the surrounding villages
 and there is a community minibus that 
 can be hired, but its future is in    
 doubt. Mopeds are very popular with   
 young people of l6 and over to allow  
 them to get around more easily.       
 Today there is no railway but Fairford
 was once linked by rail to Oxford.    
 The line opened in l873, closed on    
 June l8th l962 despite local          
 opposition.                           </content>
