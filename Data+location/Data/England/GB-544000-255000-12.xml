		<title>12Bottle Bank at Newnham Rd</title>
		<content>   The bottle bank is a dome shaped    
 container about 2 metres high where   
 people can put their empty glass      
 bottles when they have finished using 
 them. The glass is collected regularly
 and recycled to make more bottles and 
 jars. 50% of local councils have a    
 bottle bank scheme and the first one  
 was started in August 1977. Nearly    
 3,000,000 bottles are saved at bottle 
 banks every week-Prince Charles was so
 keen on the idea that he arranged for 
 one to be sited at Buckingham Palace! 
   It takes approximately 3,500 bottles
 to make 1 tonne of glass and every    
 tonne of glass saves the energy       
 equivalent of 30 gallons of oil. Since
 1977 the equivalent of 10 million     
 gallons of oil has been saved. The    
 bank at Newnham is sited well away    
 from any houses as the the smashing of
 bottles makes a lot of noise.         </content>
