		<title>02St. MARY'S CHURCH</title>
		<content>{  St. Mary's Church}is in the diocese 
 of Ripon. A church has existed in     
 Swillington since before the time of  
 the{Domesday Survey of 1086.}The main 
 body of the present building dates    
 back to the latter part of the 14th   
 Century. The{tower,}originally built  
 in the middle of the 15th Century, was
 re-built and re-faced in 1884 in      
 ashlar stone which has attracted dirt 
 from the local industry  over the last
 100 years, making the tower a         
 distinctive black colour. The tower   
 contains a peal of eight{bells}which  
 were transferred from St.Matthew's,   
 Holbeck in 1979. The three original   
 bells,two of which date back to 1656, 
 have been retained in the tower. On   
 the south side of the nave are a group
 of pews known as the{Lowther pews. }
