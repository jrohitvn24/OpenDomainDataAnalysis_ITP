		<title>08Customs: Mayday</title>
		<content> Our Mayday was very  special this year
 because it was the  eightieth  time it
 had  been  held. Many past  May_queens
 tried to come to this  Mayday. The    
 festivities  started  with a  parade  
 round the village green. The queen and
 her  attendants  were on the  may_cart
 and the local band were leading. There
 were many  stalls and some  amusements
 for children. The village children en-
 joyed dancing  round the  maypole and 
 there  was a very  good  fancy-dress  
 competition. A display of dancing  was
 given  by  majorettes. A delicious tea
 was provided and  afterwards the foot-
 ball and  netball teams  played  their
 matches.  The  winning  teams recieved
 trophies for their  work. A dance was 
 held in  the village  hall and every- 
 one enjoyed it.A  special  effort had 
 been made to  ensure that gardens and 
 village greens were tidy..            </content>
