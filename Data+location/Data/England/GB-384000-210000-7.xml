		<content> the barley goes for malting, to make  
 beer;the corn goes for testing. The   
 poorer quality is used to make        
 cattlecake.                           
   A typical day for the farmer begins 
 by feeding the animals, and making    
 sure they have enough water. The      
 routine also depends on the weather.  
 In Winter the animals are in sheds,   
 and if the water is frozen it has to  
 be carted to them.In Spring there is  
 ploughing to be done during the day,  
 but Summer and Autumn are usually     
 the busiest time of the year with     
 silage and hay making and harvesting. 
   Traditionally this farm had always  
 kept sheep and corn so the change to  
 beef cattle has been quite            
 significant.
