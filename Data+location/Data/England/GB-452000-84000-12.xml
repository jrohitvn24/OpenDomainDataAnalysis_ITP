		<title>12EGGS IN THE ARRETON VALLEY</title>
		<content>     R.E. and J.E. Richards own a 31   
 and a half acre farm at Winford Cross.
  Much of the land is used for cereal  
 crops but egg production is their main
 income.                               
     Beginning in 1966 with less than  
 500 hens the farm has been developed  
 to house 15,750.  They are bought into
 the farm as sixteen to eighteen week  
 old pullets and are kept for one year.
  All the hens are Ross Brown Hybrids  
 and are kept in cages of 3 to a cage  
 in the battery system.                
     At one year old the hens are      
 considered to be past their most      
 efficient laying period.  They are    
 sold to mainland companies which      
 process the meat into pastes,         
 sausages, chicken roll etc.  The bones
 are used for fertiliser and the       
 feathers for the stuffing in pillows _
 nothing is wasted.                    </content>
