		<title>02My Home and Where I live</title>
		<content> I live around here. It is my favourite
 place because it is where I belong.   
{The place where I live}is Chadwell    
 Heath. I like Chadwell Heath Park     
 because you can play football, running
 and lots of other games. I like school
 because you do work. I like the shops 
 because you can buy sweets and ice    
 lollies. I like the church. You can   
 sing there. I like my house in        
 Chadwell Heath.

{My bedroom}has got two beds for me and
 my sister. She is very fussy so that's
 why it is always tidy. My sister has a
 homework table near the chimney and we
 have a make-up table in the corner and
 a typewriter near the wardrobe. We    
 often read and we take turns having   
 the television.
