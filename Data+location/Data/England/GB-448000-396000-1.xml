		<content> Conisbrough is an ancient village     
 remaining small until the sinking     
 of Cadeby Main colliery around        
 1890.Since then it has gradually      
 expanded to its present{population    
 of twenty thousand,largely            
 dependent on{coal}.For a number of    
 years coal production at the colliery 
 has been declining and is expected to 
 cease in the near future.There is     
 little local alternative{employment,  
 in spite of government schemes in     
 nearby Denaby Main, another mining    
 village where the colliery has closed.
 One sixth of the survey area is       
 covered by Conisbrough and Conanby    
 villages which join into one unit.The 
 rest of the area is open countryside, 
 used for arable{farming}with a small  
 amount of rough grasing.Unemployment  
 is about fifteen percent with little  
 prospect of improvement immediately.  </content>
