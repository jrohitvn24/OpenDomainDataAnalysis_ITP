 Miss E.Conacher aged 84 is one of the 
 oldest residents in Colton.Her grand  
 _father was a farmer in the village.  
 This lady and her brothers grew up    
 here, where she has lived most of her 
 life.Now she is the only member of the
 family in the village, although a     
 nephew farms in the neighbourhood.    
 Miss Conacher has family connections  
 with Bilbrough, where her nieces and  
 nephew were educated.One of them has  
 emigrated to Canada.She remembers the 
 milk being brought to Colton from     
 Bilbrough.In 1985 Colton supplies     
 Bilbrough.When she was younger, she   
 taught in the Sunday School.          
 Miss Conacher lives in a pleasant     
 modern bungalow, which she designed   
 herself.She still drives a car, as    
 there is no public transport.         </content>
