 HEALTH CARE                           
 There are no medical facilities       
 available in the immediate vicinity   
 and visits to doctors,  dentists  and 
 chiropodists have to be made by bus or
 private transport.  There is a        
 visiting District Nurse for housebound
 people and also a Meals on Wheels     
 service for those who are eligible and
 wish to make use of it.  The General  
 Hospital serving the area is about    
 twelve miles away and this includes a 
 Consultant Maternity Unit.  Home      
 confinements are not catered for but  
 there is a community midwifery service
 to monitor ante natal and post natal  
 care.  The Ambulance Service is       
 available for hospital appointments   
 where necessary and also for          
 admissions.
