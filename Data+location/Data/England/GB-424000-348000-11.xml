		<title>11   CLUBS AND SOCIETIES</title>
		<content>  We have a{Youth Club}for boys and    
 girls between 11 and 18. Sometimes    
 there is a disco with loud music.     
 When there isn't a disco there is     
 pool, darts and games. It is quite a  
 lot of fun. There are outings to      
 Rollerworld in Derby and other places.
 When I'm 11 I will be going to Youth  
 Club.                                 
  You can start{Cubs}when you are      
 eight. We leave when we are eleven.The
 cubs play rounders and football. In   
 the winter we go sledging. We work for
 badges. There are 18 cubs in 3        
 sixes. We meet on Thursdays in the    
 village hall.

 Party. Mr. Addison plays his guitar.
