   The Ann St. Brewery was founded in

 Jersey's own brewery.  Its best known 
 beer is called{Mary Ann}after the     
 brewess who developed the special     
 recipe which is used.                 
   It brews four types of lager        
 including the famous Mary Ann Pils.   
 5,400 bottles of beer and 2,600       
 bottles of lager are produced every   
 day, both in cans and bottles.        
   The brewery is a large building with
 a tall chimney dominating that part   
 of the St. Helier skyline.            
   The company owns many of the pubs in
 Jersey and their drinks are the most  
 popular. Its beer and lager have won  
 many international prizes and is very 
 highly acclaimed.
