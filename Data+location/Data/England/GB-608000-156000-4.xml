		<content>Most people worked outside the village 
in Canterbury, Faversham, Ashford and  
surrounding towns.Only 10 of the 300   
families were farmworkers' families.   
The village school has been closed     
since 1960 and converted into a village
hall. The two ladies previously        
mentioned were on the village hall     
committee. The ladies went apple       
picking in the summer along with many  
of the other village wives.            
The Canterbury City Council was        
allowing rural industries to develop   
but were carefully controlling this    
development.The Manpower Services      
Commission had carried out recent      
improvements to the village hall.The   
two ladies considered that there was a 
strong sense of community in the       
village with everyone helping everyone 
else.
