		<title>18SHREWLEY AREA'S CONCERNS</title>
		<content>                                       
The majority of people in the Shrewley 
area were very concerned about two     
major issues:                          
  (1) the new motorway the M40 which   
  will run through the Rowington       
  farmland area; and                   
  (2) the eight new industrial units   
  which are going to be built at the   
  south end of Little Shrewley.        
The motorway will spoil the country-   
side and divert several roads. There-  
fore a decision was made, a protest    
group rose and action was taken.       
The industrial units would also spoil  
the landscape and the peacefulness of  
the country which was the very reason  
why most people lived there.           
People didn't mind the lack of amen-   
ities available in the area. The maj-  
ority went shopping either in Warwick  
or Leamington Spa about once a week.   </content>
