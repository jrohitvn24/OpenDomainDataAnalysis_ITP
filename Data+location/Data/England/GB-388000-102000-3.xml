		<title>03CHARLTON MARSHALL - (1)</title>
		<content> The village of Charlton Marshall has  
 changed considerably over the last    
 twenty-five years. Instead of mainly  
 rural countryside on the southern     
 side of the A35O, it has become a     
 built up area between the main road   
 and the railway line (now disused).   
 The housing estates built in the last 
 twenty-five years are Meadow          
 Road/Maygrove; Greenfield Road;       
 Charlton Mead; Charlton Manor;        
 Cerelton Park and Charlton Beeches.   
 Charlton Manor estate was built on    
 the site of the old manor house which 
 belonged to the Castleman-Smith       
 family,and Cerelton Park was built in 
 the grounds of a private school -     
 Clayesmore. The original school was to
 be left standing but unfortunately    
 burnt down before conversion took     
 place..
