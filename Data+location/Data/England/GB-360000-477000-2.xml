		<title>02FARMING IN KIRKBY LONSDALE</title>
		<content> In the predominantly rural setting    
 of Kirkby Lonsdale,agriculture plays  
 an important part.In the Lune Valley  
 there are some farms which have{dairy 
{cattle}but on the higher, rough       
 grazing land{sheep}form the major     
 activity.Unlike some areas,field      
 boundaries have not been destroyed to 
 make larger,more economical fields.   
 This is because there is{little arable
{farming}and also because the field    
 boundaries are old{dry stone walls    
 which are hard to remove.However some 
 walls are holed to allow freer access 
 of animals,and some are crumbling     
 through age.It is encouraging to see  
 that the{old skills}of dry stone      
 walling are still practiced.There has 
 been,as a result of farming in this   
 area,no serious threat to conservation
 or wildlife.                          
                                       </content>
