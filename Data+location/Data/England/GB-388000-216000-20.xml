   Hugo Lasne held "Brockowardinge in  
 Dudeston Hundred of the King".There   
 were 5 hides (acreage of arable land).
 The Demense or personal estate of the 
 Lord of Brockworth had two plough     
 teams, and the rest of the inhabitants
 between them had 15. Eight villeins &amp; 
 6 bordars each had different degrees  
 of servitude to the lord, the serfs   
 being little more than slaves. There  
 was a priest,hence there must have    
 been a church, but that is not        
 recorded.There were also 2 freemen and
 a bailiff.                            
   The Commissioners recorded the      
 woodland groves and copses as a       
 triangle roughly one league in length 
 and half a league in breadth.         
   A mill was mentioned, marked now as 
 Mill Farm and was worth 2 shillings a 
 year.Total value of Parish was Â£5.    </content>
