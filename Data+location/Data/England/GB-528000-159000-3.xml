		<content>   Miss Routledge came to Purley in    
 1932 and started her school.There were
  very few houses in Old Lodge Lane,   
 just two farms and a large stone house
 in Haydn Avenue beloging to the local 
 landowner, Mr Betts, an eccentric kind
 man.                                  
   The Downs were covered with wild    
 flowers, particularly orchids,        
 bluebells and lots of wild            
 strawberries.                         
   Soon after she came a local bus     
 service started up the lane, called   
 the Flying Flea. There were no bus    
 stops and the driver put people down  
 outside their own front door.         
 Purley had lots of small grocery      
 shops. It was where the trams turned  
 round.                                
   The children from Reedham Orphanage 
 used to watch the Queen's train going 
 to the Derby at Epsom.                </content>
