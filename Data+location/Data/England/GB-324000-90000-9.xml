		<content>   {Bindon Manor}dates back to the 12th
 C. Near the Manor, Roman coins have   
 been found. The Manor once belonged to
 a Saxon King. Bindon changed hands    
 many times before the reign of Henry  
 1st.                                  
    The Manor is made of grey stone and
 the central part of the Manor has     
 three storeys but it is fairly low.   
 Bits have been added to the house,    
 like a library and children had a     
 whole wing built for them. Although   
 modern they have been built to match  
 the rest of the house. There are many 
 old beams and flagstones on the floor.
 There are tapestries on some of the   
 walls and all the rooms have large    
 fire places.The house even has its own
 Chapel where the children are         
 confirmed and baptised. Bindon Estate 
 owns many farms and houses and has    
 1,691 acres of land.                  </content>
