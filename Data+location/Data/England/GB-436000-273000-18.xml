		<title>18TOLL BAR END</title>
		<content>  Toll Bar End is a former hamlet that 
 grew up around a{Toll Gate}on the     
 London road. In recent years it has   
 been absorbed by Coventry. A number of
 cottages and a school still survive   
 among the modern housing estates.     
  Today Toll Bar End's claim to fame is
 also linked to roads. For here the    
{A45(T) "Coventry Bypass"}and the      
{London rd.}from the city centre meet. 
 A road also provides a link to the    
 Siskin Drive Industrial Estate and    
 Coventry Airport at Baginton.         
  There are{plans}to build a road from 
 this junction around the eastern edge 
 of Coventry to link up with the M6/M69
 Junction. The planned{"Eastern Bypass"
 has faced severe{local opposition     
 because of fears of increased         
 pollution and the knocking down of    
 houses in the area. Despite the       
 opposition building is to start soon. </content>
