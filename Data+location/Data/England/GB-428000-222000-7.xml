		<content>  St. James's Church, Sarsden was built
 in 1760.   It stands alongside Sarsden
 House in beautiful grounds.   The     
 interior is plain, the most           
 distinguished feature being the fine  
 organ.   A lean-to extension, possibly
 of Tudor origin , is at the SW end.   
 This has a castellated parapet and    
 pointed arches. Holy Communion is     
 celebrated twice monthly.             
  Churchill Methodist Chapel was built 
 in 1927, at a cost of Â£l,400, on land 
 given by a local farmer.   Stone was  
 quarried at Chadlington, the wooden   
 chairs made from local elm, and the   
 gates made by the local blacksmith.   
 Services are held on alternate        
 Sundays, conducted by visiting        
 preachers.   A United Service,        
 Anglicans and Methodists, is held on  
 Good Friday.   The Women's World Day  
 of Prayer takes place alternate years.</content>
