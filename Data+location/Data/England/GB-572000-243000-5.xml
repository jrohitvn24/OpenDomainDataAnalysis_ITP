		<title>05The Church,Stoke-by-Clare :1</title>
		<content>  The Church dates back to the 16th    
century but it incorporates parts of an
earlier church.Looking west from the   
chancel step part of the arch of an    
earlier nave can be seen on the tower  
wall.This earlier church probably      
consisted of only a nave,chancel and   
the existing tower.The south wall of   
the nave became the south wall of a new
south aisle when the church was rebuilt
in its present form.                   
  The tower has a battlemented parapet 
and a belfry with six bells dated 1786.
There is a clock with an hour hand only
which tradition says was made by the   
village blacksmith in 1490 but is      
probably about 1670.A smaller bell on  
top of the tower strikes the hours and 
is said to have been the chapel bell of
Stoke Priory.
