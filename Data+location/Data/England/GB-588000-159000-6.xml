		<title>06RELIGION BREDGAR CHURCH</title>
		<content>St. John the Baptist Church in Bredgar 
belongs to the church of England.The   
church has close links with Bredgar    
primary school which is also governed  
by the church.During the summer        
months the children attend a short     
service on Wednesday morning.The church
dates back to medieval times,but the   
hard wooden pews are victorian. Despite
having five parishes to cover the vicar
still manages at least two services a  
week.The average congregation is about 
twenty nine.There are no bell ringers, 
this being done by electricity. There  
is a Sunday School and a small Bible   
class.The church magazine comes out ten
times a year.The vicar visits sick     
people and newcomers to the village.On 
average the church is used for weddings
about four times a year.
