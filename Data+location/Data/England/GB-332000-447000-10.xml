		<title>10FLEETWOOD PARK</title>
		<content>   There are two gardens in the park.  
 The flower garden has displays of     
 ornamental kale and variegated        
 honeysuckle,- purple and lavender,    
 yellow and biscuit, pink and cream and
 white and ivory. I enjoy reading when 
 sitting in the rose garden where each 
 bed has a single colour of rose,- one 
 bed has all blue roses. They stretch  
 out in a circular terrace from the    
 monument like one enormous bouquet.   
   The ornamental duck pond is fed by a
 little stream and protected by a      
 wooden fence and bushes. Above the    
 level of the pond is a small wood with
 picnic tables so that people can watch
 the 15 varieties of fowl, from marbled
 teal to mandarin ducks. There used to 
 be fish but not now; some people find 
 it amusing to destroy or vandalize the
 park. Many people find happiness in   
 the park; we must keep caring for it. </content>
