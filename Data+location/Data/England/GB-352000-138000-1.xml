		<content>    Our area is situated to the east of
 Glastonbury at the foot of the famous 
 Tor. In the south west corner of our  
 area the land rises to 50m and in the 
 south east corner is Pennard Hill,    
 which rises to about 110m. For the    
 most part the land is little above sea
 level and the northern section is     
 typical Somerset moor. This land would
 originally have been drowned but is   
 now drained (and has been since 13th  
 century) and meadowed for dairy farms.
    The village of West Pennard lies   
 at the foot of Pennard Hill. The main 
 Glastonbury to Shepton Mallet road    
 runs through the village and forms the
 southern boundary of our area.The road
 passes over the ancient Ponter's Ball.
 This is a ridge,it's exact purpose and
 date of contsruction are unclear but  
 it was probably a fortification and a 
 boundary line between villages.       </content>
