		<title>06THE RIVER WELLAND</title>
		<content>    Situated at the end of the         
{Coronation Channel}and the{River      
{Welland}are sluise gates. They form   
 part of the drainage system around    
 Spalding so that the low land will not
 flood. The{River Welland}is tidal and 
 it is necerary to keep the river level
 at a manageable level so that the town
 and surrounding area does not flood.  
   {Spalding}town was flooded          
 completely in 1947. In 1953 the {     
{Coronation Channel}was built which is 
 used as a by-pass for the river water 
 around the and a means of containing  
 high levels of water in{River}caused  
 through a conbination of high rainfall
 and high tides. Since 1947 only one   
 part of the{River}has flooded and this
 happened near the sluice gates in 1958
 and 1978. Since 1978 major            
 improvements have been made in this   
 area to control the level of the water</content>
