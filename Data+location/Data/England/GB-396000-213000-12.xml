 like stamps and pensions. We asked him
 if he would like to sell anything else
 but he said there was no demand as    
 most people had cars and could easily 
 get to town. He does not want to make 
 any changes.                          
      By contrast the post office at   
 Colesbourne is a mini supermarket as  
 well as post office. Almost anything  
 can be bought for everyday needs. It  
 is quite different from Coberley post 
 office being modern and equipped with 
 facilities like a deep freeze.        
 Colesbourne post office is by a main  
 road and a popular inn. It is also 8  
 miles from the nearest shops whereas  
 Coberley is just under 4 miles from   
 shops and tucked away in the little   
 hamlet of Coberley. Perhaps these     
 reasons are why the two rural post    
 offices have developed differently.   </content>
