 The housing in this area is nothing   
 special.  I don't live in a terraced  
 house, at least that's what people    
 call the houses that are squashed up  
 and packed like sardines.Walking down 
 the street you could well be sick on  
 the combinations of colours of some of
 the houses. For instance you may see a
 green one next to a bright pink one.  
 The gardens of some houses look like  
 the Amazon Jungle while others look   
 like the front of Buckingham Palace.  
 This is basically because some people 
 don't bother to cut the grass while   
 others want to give a good impression 
 to outsiders.                         
 Our front garden can be classed as    
 respectable which is not surprising   
 because I always end up doing the     
 gardening.
