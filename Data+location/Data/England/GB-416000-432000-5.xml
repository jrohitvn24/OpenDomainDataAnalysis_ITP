		<title>05ST GEORGE'S HALL BRADFORD</title>
		<content>   Designed by  Lockwood &amp; Mawson, this
 large {concert hall}was built in 1853.
 The  style  is  classic  revival  with
 Corinthian  pilasters and round headed
 windows.                              
   Full  refurbishing  of  the building
 took   place   recently   and  it  now
 operates   a   computerised    booking
 system.                               
                                       
   Subscription   concerts   by     the
{Manchester Halle Orchestra}take  place
 annually.                             
   Various jazz and  pop  concerts take
 place during the  year,  as  well   as
 visits from foreign  entertainers  and
 shows  featuring  current   well-known
 variety artistes.                     
                                       
   The Hall is also used for occasional
 trade exhibitions and also wrestling  
 contests.                             </content>
