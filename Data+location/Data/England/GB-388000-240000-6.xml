		<title>06MODERN FARMING, STRENSHAM.</title>
		<content> The landowners, mostly insurance      
 companies or pension funds, are more  
 interested in the land than the       
 buildings some of which, including    
 barns, fall into a bad state of       
 repair. The widespread use of         
 machinery on farms now means that     
 fewer people are needed to work on the
 land. A 500 acre farm can now be      
 managed by the owner, plus two        
 workmen. The farms no longer need so  
 many{'tied' cottages}and these are    
 readily bought by city workers thus   
 pushing up prices. The proximity of   
 the{M5}has brought to this rural area 
 commuters who work in the surrounding 
 large towns. The farms in this area   
 are either arable, dairy or a combi-  
 nation of both. Main crops are{wheat,}
{barley}or{food for livestock.}Some    
 farms retain their orchards of apple, 
 pear or plum but woodland is sparse.  </content>
