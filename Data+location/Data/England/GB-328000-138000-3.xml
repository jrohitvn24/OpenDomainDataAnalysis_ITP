		<content> Life is fairly busy with a coalyard   
 and plastics works on one side of the 
 village. There are 4 farms and many   
 fields. An electrician, builder,      
 decorator, and an ice_cream man live  
 in the village and do occasional jobs 
 for the villagers as well as working  
 away. Every day there is a batch of   
 coal lorries and tractors coming      
 around the local lanes. Also a school 
 bus for Wembdon School stops here.    
 There is plenty of social life        
 connected with the village hall.There 
 are karate lessons, table_tennis clubs
 with a team playing in the Bridgwater 
 league, a keep_fit class, discos,     
 chesse and wine parties and skittles  
 nights, along with the occasional     
 whist drive. There are childrens      
 parties at Christmas and a meal at    
 harvest time. Church services are held
 on Sunday mornings.                   </content>
