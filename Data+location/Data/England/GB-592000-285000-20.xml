		<title>20Battle Area, Bridgham</title>
		<content> Part of Bridgham heath, together with 
 a large area of heathland to the      
 north-west of our block, forms what is
 known as the Battle Area.   This was  
 taken over by the Army in 1940 for    
 training purposes.  The inhabitants of
 5 villages within the Battle Area had 
 to leave their homes; several families
 settled in Bridgham.   After the war, 
 the area was retained for military    
 training and is a completely closed   
 zone.  The Battle Area is a rather    
 mysterious zone, often echoing with   
 explosions and bursts of gunfire.     
                                       
 On the positive side, the Breckland   
 landscape is maintained here and the  
 zone is reported to be an ideal nature
 reserve, creatures apparently having  
 adapted to intermittent warfare above 
 their heads.                          
                                       </content>
