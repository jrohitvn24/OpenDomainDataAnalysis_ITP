		<title>09Haddenham Wychert</title>
		<content> Haddenham is famous for its{wychert   
{walls and houses.}Wychert means{White 
{Earth (clay).}In the old days         
 Haddenham builders always used wychert
 because it was{cheap and strong.      
 Wychert is made by{mixing cut straw   
{with local soil and small stones.}Old 
 builders used to say that "A wall     
 needs a good hat and a strong pair of 
 boots". The walls are built in layers 
 of 60cm, called{'Berries',}and        
{thatched at the top}(the hat). They   
 were tall to stop animals from eating 
 the thatch!                           
 Mr Nelms was one of the last people to
 build in wychert in Haddenham. The    
 houses in Scotsgrove were the most    
 recent ones built in this way.
