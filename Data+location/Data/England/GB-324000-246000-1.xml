		<title>01WYE VALLEY FROM THE BORDER</title>
		<content> This area is divided by the A438 and  
 river. It has navigational rights and 
 is used for canoeing and the annual   
 Raft Race. There is salmon, trout and 
 coarse fishing. The Toll Bridge for   
 light motor vehicles costs 20p return.
 Agriculturally consisting of three    
 main farms: Brilley Court, Millhalf   
 and Sheepcote (accommodating Golden   
 Valley Hunt foxhounds). The two inns, 
 'Rhydspence' an old drover's inn and  
 'The Boat' beside the river, offer    
 good food. Places of worship are St.  
 Peter and St. Paul's Church with a    
 weekly service, and Methodist Chapel  
 at Brilley has an occasional service. 
 Children travel to schools outside the
 area. A workshop makes gates and      
 building needs. A small precision     
 grinding factory employs local people.
 Most residents are retired. Those     
 working travel daily to towns.        </content>
