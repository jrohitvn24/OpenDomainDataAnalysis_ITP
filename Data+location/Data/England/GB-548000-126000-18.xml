		<title>18HIGH HURSTWOOD SOCIAL LIFE 2</title>
		<content> Annual events in the village include  
 the Summer Fete which is always held  
 in June with its side shows, stalls   
 and dog show. The High Hurstwood Horse
 Show attracts riders from miles       
 around. A Bonfire Night Party takes   
 place at the beginning of November    
 with a torchlight procession, fancy   
 dress competition for the children and
 firework display, followed by hot dogs
 and other refreshments served in the  
 Village Hall. But the finest pursuit  
 in which every member of the community
 can take part is within the country-  
 side itself. It is a particularly     
 beautiful part of East Sussex and High
 Hurstwood can produce some of the     
 loveliest walks and breathtaking views
 for miles around. Man-made pleasures  
 might not abound but natural pleasures
 are here for all to enjoy.
