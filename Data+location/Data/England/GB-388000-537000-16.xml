		<title>16PLAY AREA FOR WESTGATE</title>
		<content>  The County Council were planning to  
 make the old railway station at       
 Westgate into a picnic site but       
 the villagers wanted somewhere for    
 children to play instead.             
    They set up PAWS (Play Area for    
 Westgate Scheme) and raised money by  
 having jumble sales, discos, an       
 assault course, a Christmas Pantomime 
 and chopping logs to sell. Grants were
 given by the Sports Council and County
 Council.                              
    First the site had to be levelled .
 Then a space bigger than a tennis     
 court was tarmacked and fenced.The    
 station offices have been turned into 
 a club house and the surrounding land 
 has been planted with grass seed and  
 young trees.                          
    Children can play football, tennis,
 basketball, netball and other games on
 the area. It opens in September 1985. </content>
