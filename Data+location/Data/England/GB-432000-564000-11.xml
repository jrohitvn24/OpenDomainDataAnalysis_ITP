		<title>11THE TYNESIDE METRO</title>
		<content> The Tyne and Wear Metro System was    
 officially opened by Her Majesty      
 Queen Elizabeth II on 6th Nov.1981.It 
 is a system of transport that is      
 unique in Britain. Metro trains run at
 intervals of 5 or 10 minutes along    
 both banks of the River Tyne serving  
 the towns situated there.In Central   
 Newcastle and Gateshead there is a 3  
 minute frequency of service. Each     
 twin-car unit is capable of carrying  
 84 passengers seated and 188 standing.
 They are powered by electricity from  
 overhead lines at 1500 volts  and have
 a maximum speed of                    
 80k.p.h.(50m.p.h.).At the same time as
 the Metro was opened,most of the bus  
 routes in Tyne and Wear were altered  
 so that the buses now 'feed' the Metro
 stations and it is hoped that         
 passengers will use the Metro for the 
 main part of their journey.           </content>
