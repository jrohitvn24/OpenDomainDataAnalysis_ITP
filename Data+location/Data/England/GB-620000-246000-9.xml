		<content> A doctor holds a surgery in the parish
 hall at Bealings.  With no dispensing 
 pharmacy  villagers have either to be 
 given medicine by the doctor or take  
 their prescriptions to nearby towns - 
 major hardship for the elderly and    
 chronic sick.  Villagers are served by
 community midwives, nurses and health 
 visitors who are attached to the      
 doctors surgeries with which the      
 person is registered.  meals-on-wheels
 (cooked at Melton) are provided by    
 W.R.V.S. and home helps by Social     
 Serices at Woodbridge.  There are two 
 residential homes for the elderly     
 established in large houses in        
 Bealings.  The nearest acute hospital 
 is in Ipswich, only 2-3 miles away.   
 The poor bus services cause dificulty 
 in visiting doctors and hospital.     
 This although a legitimate social     
 concern affect only a minority.       </content>
