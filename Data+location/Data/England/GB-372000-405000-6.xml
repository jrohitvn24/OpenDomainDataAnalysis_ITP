		<title>06HOME LIFE SURVEY</title>
		<content> We used a questionaire on "home life" 
 in every class in St John's school. We
 then took the results from the three  
 top junior classes and the top infant 
 class, this gave us 100 children. From
 this we produced the following piece  
 on home life.                         
 We found that most children slept in a
 bed only a few had a bunk bed.        
 Nightware was fairly evenly divided,  
 pyjamas for boys and nightdresses for 
 girls.50% of the children had their   
 own room and used a shower. Nearly    
 every child had an uncooked breakfast 
 of toast and conrnflakes. 47% However 
 had a hot evening meal cooked on a gas
 stove. Many homes had a deep freeze.  
 Houses are mostly heated by central   
 heating supplemented by gas fires, 24%
 had fire guards.50% of the children   
 have a video or computer.75% of the   
 children have pets.47% holiday abroad.</content>
