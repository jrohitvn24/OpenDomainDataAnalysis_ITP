		<title>20Men on the Farm in Langford</title>
		<content>  A man working on a farm in the area, 
with some experience, could expect to  
earn about 100 pounds a week basic, not
including overtime. This would be for a
forty hour week. In the summer his     
hours would be nearer 60 per week. On  
the farms in this area he could expect 
to be offered a house with no rent or  
rates to pay.                          
  The jobs on the farms are numerous.  
Here are some that you would find in   
this area: tractor driving, ploughing, 
combining, cowman, cutting grasss,     
cleaning out, moving bales, cutting    
hedges, feeding, and so on.            
  Safety on the farm is important for  
all the workers.Over the last ten years
 one farm in the area one man was hurt 
when a tractor turned over, another was
nearly suffocated when some bales fell 
on him and another hurt his hand when a
cow knocked him against a rail.        </content>
