		<title>08A Head Gamekeeper</title>
		<content> The Head Gamekeeper on the Normanby   
 Park Estate is responsible for the    
 gamebirds,such as partridges and      
 pheasants,on the Estate's 6000 acres. 
 The present keeper has been doing this
 job for 27 years.When he first started
 there were three other keepers where  
 as now there is one but motor vehicles
 are now used instead of the foot      
 patrols of 30 years ago.To ensure an  
 adequate number of birds eggs are     
 hatched in incubators and the chicks  
 reared in pens until they are old     
 enough to be released into the        
 wild.Thereafter the keepers protect   
 them as well as possible from vermin  
 and predators such as stoats,weasels, 
 ferrets,foxes and poachers.Poachers   
 are a nuisance and the keeper has to  
 be on the alert.He has a close working
 relationship with the police and can  
 contact them by radio telephone.      </content>
