		<title>06LITTLE LONDON IN ROCHDALE</title>
		<content>                                       
      {'Little London'}is part of the  
 area of Balderstone. It includes 22   
 cottages on Oldham Road, Holly Street,
 Craiglands and Culvert Street.        
      It was built in 1863 by Joshua   
 Radcliffe for people who used to work 
 in his {Balderstone Mill}spinning     
 cotton. Many of these people came from
 London and so the area became known as
 'Little London'.                      
      The cottages were due for        
 demolition ten years ago, but were    
 saved by changes in council policy and
 made to look like new in 1982.        
      Councillor Derek Walker and Mr.  
 Geoff Sanderson re-opened them on {   
{April 20th.,}1982.
