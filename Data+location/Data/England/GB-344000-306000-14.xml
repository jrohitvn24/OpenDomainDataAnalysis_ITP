		<title>14HOUSING IN BAYSTON HILL</title>
		<content>    Most of the houses in Bayston Hill 
 are semi-detached.There are           
 semi-detached council houses, many of 
 which have been purchased by the      
 tenants, all round the junior school  
 campus.Elsewhere there are private    
 semi-detached houses,                 
 bungalows,domerbungalows.Amongst these
 are some detached houses.The more     
 recently built tend to be open plan   
 while the rest have enclosed gardens. 
 There are some old peoples bungalows  
 next to the school.Several cottages   
 built in the late 1800s still         
 remain.Above the shops there are      
 flats.Lythwood Hall has been divided  
 up into separate units.One of its two 
 gate houses remains as Lythwood       
 Lodge.The further up Lyth  Hill Road  
 you go the houses become grander.The  
 very rich people live on the top of   
 Lyth Hill.                            </content>
