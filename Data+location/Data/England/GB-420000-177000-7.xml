		<content> The majority of{sheep}grazed in this  
 area are Mule/Suffolk cross, bred to  
 produce good mothers,  highly         
 prolific breeders, and a reasonable   
 carcass when the lambs are killed for 
 meat for human consumption.  A flock  
 of pure bred Dorset Down is also      
 kept in this area.                    
 The{beef cattle}are mainly animals    
 that have come out of the dairy herd  
 when no replacements are needed (both 
 male and female). The majority are    
 cross breeds, bred from Hereford,     
 Charolais, and other bulls to produce 
 a good carcass and to suit the        
 required feeding system.              
 There is an intensive system{pig}unit 
 on the high ground.  The pigs are     
 housed for their entire life in       
 covered and semi-covered buildings;   
 fattened and sold for meat for human  
 consumption.                          </content>
