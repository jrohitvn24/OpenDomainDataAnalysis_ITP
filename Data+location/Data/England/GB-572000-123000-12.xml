		<title>12Society of Brothers</title>
		<content>  Darvell Hall is the British home of  
 the Hutterian Society of              
 Brothers.Their religion is Christian  
 and their life-style is communal.The  
 population is roughly 200,of whom 91  
 are of school age or below.The        
 philosophy of the Society is based on 
 the family,but with a strong emphasis 
 on communal living.Education,up to the
 age of 13,takes place within the      
 Society;after which age the children  
 attend the local secondary            
 school.Funds are raised chiefly       
 through the manufacture of wooden toys
 made from imported maple wood.They    
 also make equipment for the           
 handicapped.This is the only section  
 of the Brotherhood in Great           
 Britain,although they have other      
 communities,particularly in the U.S.A.
 and Canada,including a farm of 80,000 
 acres.                                </content>
