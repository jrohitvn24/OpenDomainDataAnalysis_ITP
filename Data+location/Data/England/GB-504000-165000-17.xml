		<title>17A Day at school</title>
		<content> My name is Nicola Cumberbeach and I   
 attend Salesian School, Chertsey.I am 
 13 years old and am in the 2nd year. I
 travel to school by train.            
 Today is Tuesday so we have assembly, 
 and I have Drama. Following this is   
 Geography, then Art, with break in    
 between. Then it is lunchtime for one 
 hour. After this is French then       
 English, which I enjoy. I think I     
 would like to be a journalist when I  
 leave school. After break is science  
 then Religion.                        
 As I have to travel home by train I do
 not arrive until 5.00 pm.             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
