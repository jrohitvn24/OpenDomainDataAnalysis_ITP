		<content> This is an arable farming area of     
 South Lincolnshire with less than 100 
 people living in it.The largest       
 settlement is in a small hamlet called
 Aisby which is in the north of the    
 block.There are no amenities and no   
 industry and only 1 main road,the A52,
 crosses the block.                    
 The limestone landscape shows features
 of former glaciation during the last  
 Ice Age.                              
 There is evidence of former Romano-   
 British occupation.                   
 The land to the south of the A52 is   
 mainly owned by 1 large estate and is 
 farmed by the estate-financed company 
 and feq of the local inhabitants have 
 jobs on the land.
