		<content> A survey of people in the area        
 revealed various causes for concern   
 and areas of change in the village.   
 Two scrap yards at Turner's Green and 
 not infrequent heavy lorries are      
 casting a blight on the inherent      
 beauty of the countryside.Insecticides
 have reduced the number of poppies in 
 the cornfields and certain insects    
 such as glow worms. Many farms and    
 related houses have been split and    
 sold to "suburban strangers" and are  
 rarely bases for agriculture. One     
 comment was that farming was often a  
 "leisure" activity in this area rather
 than a chief means of livelihood.     
 Although local dialect and accent are 
 fading there are one or two local     
 expressions still in common usage eg. 
 if there are clouds in the west it is 
 said to be "raining over Will's       
 mothers."                             </content>
