 counting the traffic in both          
 directions.The A390 road is very busy 
 and noisy.There are double white lines
 outside the school.There have been 6  
 accidents in the last 2 years near the
 school.                               
 The infant class was once a Toll House

 the noise of the traffic in the       
 classroom.They have asked for double  
 glazing.

 make their way further west.
