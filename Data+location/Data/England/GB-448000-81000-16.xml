		<title>16ECOLOGY: BLEAK DOWN TIP</title>
		<content>     The tip is owned by Vectis Stone  
 Ltd. and has been managed by its      
 subsidiary Co., Cheek Plant and       
 Transport Ltd., since 1972.           
    The extent of the dump is 66 acres.
 The owners had to put in a new road to
 the tip , build a hut for the tip     
 operator and put in a wheel wash for  
 the lorry.                            
     This private tip is open all day: 
 Monday-Friday 0730-1730 and Saturday  
 0800-1200. It is funny that the       
 manager's name is  Mr. Scattergood!   
     You are not allowed to dump       
 poisonous substances or drugs because 
 of dangers to the rivers. Rubbish is  
 buried immediately.                   
     The only pests are snakes, as rats
 are kept away by wild cats.           
     The tip will last for 15 years.
