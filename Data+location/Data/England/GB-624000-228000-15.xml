		<title>15Dovercourt-Lighthouse Appeal</title>
		<content> Despite their movable nature, the     
 Dovercourt lighthouses were never     
 moved, even though the channel        
 continued to shift. The Dovercourt    
 Lights were finally extinguished in   
 1917,because the channel had been     
 marked with lighted buoys.There were  
 many lighthouses of this type around  
 the coast of Britain but they have    
 nearly all disappeared. The           
 Dovercourt two - one on land, the     
 other at sea at high tide _ are the   
 only pair to survive. They are a good 
 example of their type and every effort
 is being made to preserve and restore 
 them.In recent years the High Stewards
 Lighthouse Appeal has been launched   
 and funds are now enough to restore   
 the one on the shore,as a historic    
 landmark. Restoration of the other    
 lighthouse will hopefully come later.
