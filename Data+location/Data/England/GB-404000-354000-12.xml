     The fishing season lasts from     
April until  October.  In Onecote,     
Rainbow Trout and Brown Trout can be   
caught in the River Hamps.  Fly        
fishing is the main and best method    
for catching trout but younger         
fishermen would rather use maggots.    
The fishing places in Onecote are      
mainly private and can only be used    
with the farmer's permission.          
                                       
     The children in Onecote often get 
together to enjoy themselves.          
                                       
     Badminton is one game that the    
children of Onecote play on a fine     
day. Each person takes a racket and a  
shuttle cock along to the old school   
playground.  A net is provided.
