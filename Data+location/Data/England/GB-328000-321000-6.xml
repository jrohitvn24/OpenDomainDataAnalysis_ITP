		<content> Mr. Kynastons machinery is quite up to
 date. He tries to keep it as modern as
 he can so that he can collect and     
 store his cattle more efficient. He   
 keeps five tractors,four Massey       
 Fergusons and one David Brown. He has 
 one Massey Ferguson combine harvester.
 A small engined tractor, costs around 
 Â£10,000. But a tractor with a big     
 engine and four wheel drive costs     
 Â£18,000 or even more.                 
   The milking parlour is also modern  
 and efficient. They have a special    
 feeding system to give the cows       
 exactly the right amount of food. If  
 they are lactating they get more food 
 so they will produce more milk.
