		<title>02BADDESLEY CLINTON MANOR -1-</title>
		<content> The history of the manor begins long  
 before the thirteenth century,when the
{Clinton}family settled there. In      
 1438,it was sold to John Brome,whose  
 grand-daughter married Sir Edward     
{Ferrers.}Their descendants held       
 Baddesley until{1970.}They were a     
{Roman Catholic}family,and in the      
 sixteenth century when religion was   
 very turbulent,the manor house was    
 used as a{hiding-place}for Jesuit     
 priests who were being persecuted.    
                                       
{The house}is enclosed by trees        
 and lies in a hollow of the park,and  
 therefore cannot be seen from the     
 road. It is not a large manor,but very
 picturesque with grey stone walls,tile
 roofs and tall red chimneys. It is    
 suurrounded by a moat.
