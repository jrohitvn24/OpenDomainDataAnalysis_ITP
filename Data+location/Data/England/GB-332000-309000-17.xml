		<title>17Hargreaves wood.(May 1985)</title>
		<content> A couple of days ago we went to       
 Hargreaves wood. Hargreaves wood is a 
 wood on top of a hill which is a      
 beautiful and interesting place. It   
 has got a lot of wildlife and         
 beautiful flowers. The map reference  
 _ is 098106. On the way there we had  
 a look at the fields around. Most of  
 them were arable, but some were       
 grass.We saw quite a lot of animals:  
 crows, mice, ladybirds and spiders. We
 also saw rabbit and badger tracks. We 
 found what could have been badger     
 setts or fox earths.{Flowers}: We saw 
 plenty of bluebells as it is the right
 time of year(May). Lords and Ladies   
 were flourishing, and we saw docks.   
 (Docks are a kind of remedy for nettle
 stings). There were many nettles      
 including the yellow kind. Also seen: 
 ground ivy,stitchwort,campions.This   
 wood has been reduced by local farmers</content>
