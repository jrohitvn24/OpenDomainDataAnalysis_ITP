		<title>01Cannock Chase.</title>
		<content>    Our block is divided into two      
distinct areas by the north to south   
line of the A34 trunk road. To the west
of this road is a narrow strip of      
mainly agricultural land, while to the 
east, and covering about seven eigths  
of the block,lies Cannock Chase.       
    Cannock Chase, known locally (and  
throughout this section of the survey) 
as "the Chase", is designated as an    
an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. 
    In our section of the Chase, there 
are two main land areas. These are     
{Cannock Forest} owned by the Forestry 
Commission,and {Cannock Chase Country  
Park} owned by Staffordshire County    
Council. There is also a small area of 
grassland.                             
    The forest is mainly coniferous,   
and the Country Park is open heathland 
with a little deciduous woodland.
