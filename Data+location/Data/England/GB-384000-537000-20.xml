		<content> There is a strong sense of community  
 and a caring for others. The Wear     
 Valley Council has an excellent 'Good 
 Neighbour' scheme whereby someone is  
 paid to visit pensioners on a regular 
 basis, but actual neighbours are help-
 ful, especially in times of trouble. A
 luncheon club for pensioners in       
 Ireshopeburn is run by volunteers,    
 meals coming from the School Kitchen  
 at Stanhope. Many organisations are   
 capably run by local people. The      
 creation of the Museum is an excellent
 illustration of local talents and     
 cooperative effort. Congregations at  
 the three churches are small but      
 faithful.Anglicans and Methodists hold
 united services and support each      
 other's fund raising efforts. There is
 an independence of spirit which has   
 led many unemployed to set up their   
 own businesses or work away from home.</content>
