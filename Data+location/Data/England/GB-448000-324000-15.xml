		<title>15FARMING SUTTON BONINGTON</title>
		<content>{Tom Shepherd}the{farmer}moved his{farm
 from Park Lane to Hungary Lane. He    
 decided to do this because being based
 in the village caused many            
 difficulties. Some  of his land had   
 been sold off to builders and the     
 school which meant there were        {
 complaints about smell and noise. He  
 had  poor access to the{fields}and it 
 was impossible to leave the yard from 
 08.30_09.15. Moving to another site   
 had several advantages. He was able to
 expand and had more room for turning  
{tractors.}The site was much bigger so 
 it could be used for mechanical       
{farming}and he only had to employ 3   
 men instead of 9.{Mr Shepherd}is      
 mainly an arable{farmer}and owns all  
 the equipment needed. His 400 acre    
{farm}is of average size.Today an acre 
 costs Â£2000 and{Mr Shepherd's farm    
 belonging to{Miss Paget}is worth Â£1m. </content>
