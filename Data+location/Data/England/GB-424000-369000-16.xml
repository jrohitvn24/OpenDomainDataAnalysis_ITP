		<content>    Living in the village of Edensor   
 means that we are always on show to   
 the public. Our gardens are much      
 admired and all the houses are "listed
 buildings" of individual design.      
                                       
    Almost all the residents are       
 employees or past employees of the    
 Chatsworth Estate and share the same  
 loyalties and interests.              
                                       
    The junior children go to school at
 Pilsley, 1.5 miles away, and the older
 pupils go by bus to the secondary     
 school in Bakewell.                   
                                       
    St.Peter's Church dominates the    
 village green and is large enough for 
 more people than usually attend. Most 
 of the parishioners support the church
 at functions such as Edensor Village  
 Day and the annual Sheep Service.     </content>
