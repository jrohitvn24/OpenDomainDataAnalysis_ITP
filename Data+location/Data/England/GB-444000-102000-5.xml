		<title>05Community  Association</title>
		<content>    In 1955 the Fawley and District    
 Community Association was formed. This
 was to help improve life in the       
 area,and so that people could have    
 things to do during the day. When the 
 association got the backing it needed 
 they started to raise the money .It   
 took 6_7 years to do this and in 1962 
 Fawley parish Council built a hall for
 them to use.                          
   Mrs M.Cock the warden helps to      
 arrange a lot of the activities they  
 do. The association is a registered   
 charity,so that means it can't give   
 money to other charities but it can   
 rent out halls cheaply ,so they can   
 raise more money for them selves. The 
 Community also runs a play scheme for 
 children in the summer. They also have
 a lot of other activities like Stamp  
 Club and Tufty Club. A lot of the     
 people are voluntary workers.         </content>
