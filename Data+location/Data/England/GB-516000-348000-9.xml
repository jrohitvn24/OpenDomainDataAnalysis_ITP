		<content>  Land is ploughed or cultivated       
 straight after harvest, then oil seed 
 rape is drilled, potatoes lifted,     
 fields worked and winter wheat and    
 barley drilled. Pellets are spread    
 to kill slugs, weeds are killed with  
 sprays and crops are fed with         
 fertilizer. Most farmers are unhappy  
 with the Common Market. They think it 
 encourages produce mountains &amp; they   
 fear we're going to have hard years,  
 with prices low but costs high. They  
 wish excess produce could go to famine
 areas. A few cattle are fattened, and 
 some small farmers do contract work. {
{CHANGES IN 25 YRS.                    
 Fields have increased from 18 to 50   
 acres. On 900 acre farms, tractors    
 have increased from 4 in number to 12,
 but the workforce has fallen from 13  
 to 5. Average craftsmans' weekly wage 
 is Â£120.                              </content>
