		<content>{DRAMATIC SOCIETY }This society has    
 been going since 1880. There are plays
 at Easter and a pantomime at          
 Christmas.All ages go although the    
 younger ones usually join in the      
 pantomime at Christmas. People join   
 the society but do catering instead of
 performing on stage.                  
{BRITISH LEGION}Members are servicemen,
 ex_members of the forces. They play   
 darts, skittles, snooker, billiards   
 and bingo. They open 7 nights a week. 
 The British Legion are also the       
 founders of the poppy appeal. To be a 
 member you would pay Â£3.50 a year.    
{ARTS APPRECIATION SOCIETY }This       
 society basically appreciates all     
 kinds of arts such as interests in    
 buildings and paintings. There are    
 trips organised for days out to plays,
 ballets, concerts, or to the theatre  
 at Southampton, Poole, Salisbury,     </content>
