		<title>11Life in Aston Village</title>
		<content>   Its peaceful in Aston, trees heavy  
 with foliage overhange the roads and  
 pathways. Through the branches of the 
 willow, a duck is busily cleaning     
 herself. Some blossom hasdrifted to   
 the ground, leaving a hint of white   
 here and there. In the distance I can 
 hear the chug-chug of a tractor and   
 the voices of the schoolchildren      
 nearby. The pond ripples in the gentle
 breeze, flies hover round above. On   
 the hill a cluster of poppies shimmer 
 in the sunlight, and beyond, fields of
 brilliant yellow dip and rise. Back in
 the village one or two people saunter 
 to the general stores, where a        
 wholemeal loaf would cost about 25p.  
 Nearby at The Rose and Crown, a couple
 sit outside having a drink, where a   
 pint of beer would cost around 95p. As
 we leave aston, the smell of freshly  
 cut grass lingers in the afternoor air</content>
