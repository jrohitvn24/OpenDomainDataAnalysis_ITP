		<content>    Construction started in 1952 and   
 was completed in 1956.This reservoir  
 supplies the{water needs}for Daventry,
 Northampton and Weedon.It has an area 
 of 3 square kilometres and holds about
 18 million square metres of water.    
 Chlorine is introduced into the water 
 as a disenfectant.                    
    The Anglian Water Authority aims to
 develop the area's potential as a     
 recreation centre during future years,
 despite some{local protests.}It is    
 believed that this will be a facility 
 in increasing demand as the people of 
 the 1980's find themselves enjoying an
 increase in leisure}time.             
    Pitsford Water is already a{popular
{centre}for trout fishing and a sailing
 club makes regular use of the         
 reservoir. Picnic sites and car-parks 
 have been established near Pitsford   
 and Holcot villages.                  </content>
