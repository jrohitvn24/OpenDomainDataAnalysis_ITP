		<content> Langham Leisure,a non-profit making   
 organisation was set up to create     
 interest in the village and to show   
 how many arts and crafts were         
 represented amongst the villagers.    
 Later LACE-Langham Arts and Crafts    
 Enterprise-began which brings together
 craftsmen from the area with a wide   
 variety of skills.An annual exhibition
 and sale is held in Langham School on 
 the Mayday Bank Holiday.This year     
 thirty-two villagers entered work     
 including needlework,crotchet,knitting
 soft and wooden toys,furniture,photo- 
 graphy and jewelry.Over eight-hundred 
 members of the public visited the     
 event which included an exhibition of 
 local children's art which reflected  
 Langham's "Tidy Village" Campaign.
