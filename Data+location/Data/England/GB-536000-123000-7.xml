		<content> The main road through our block is the
 A272 (which runs through square 3623) 
 and it runs through Scaynes Hill.     
 The other well-used road is Church    
 Road,which goes under the Bluebell    
 Railway.The A272 comes from Haywards  
 Heath and goes on to Lewes.Traffic is 
 heavy on this road while leaving our  
 block.Church Road branches off the    
 A272 in Scaynes Hill.It passes the    
 Sewage Works and Nash Farm.The only   
 station in our block is owned by the  
 Bluebell Railway,and the stop is at   
 Freshfield Halt.The trains carry      
 roughly 250000 to 300000 passengers   
 through our block,per year.There are  
 12 steam engines in working           
 order.County buses pass through our   
 block,but not very often.This is      
 because there is only 1 village of any
 size;Scaynes Hill.
