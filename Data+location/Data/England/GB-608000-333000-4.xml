		<title>04EDGEFIELD CHURCH IN 1985</title>
		<content> Last year the Church celebrated the   
 centenary of being rebuilt on its     
 present site by installing on the     
 south side a new stained glass window 
 designed by John Hayward.It depicts   
 St Peter and St Paul, the old tower   
 and the present church, a typical     
 scene of ploughing and seagulls, and a
 charming roundel showing Canon Marcon 
 on his bicycle. More examples of      
 modern stained glass are in the porch 
 -four delightful small windows dated  
 1981.                                 
 There is no longer a Rector: the      
 Rectory has been sold  &amp; the Rector of
 Holt is now also Rector of Edgefield. 
 On alternate Sundays there is Holy    
 Communion in the morning or Evensong  
 in the afternoon, and there is a      
 regular weekday Communion service.An  
 unusual feature is the Sunday School, 
 because it takes place on Tuesdays.   </content>
