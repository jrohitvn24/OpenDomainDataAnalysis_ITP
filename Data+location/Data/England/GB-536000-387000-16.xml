  The bus service into Louth is a      
 commuter based service. Many people   
 use their own cars. Farm animals and  
 produce are carried by large lorries  
 which are too big for the narrow lanes
 The nearest railway station is at     
 Market Rasen, 20miles to the East,    
 over the Wolds, which in winter can be
 hazardous. The railway line from      
 Grimsby to Kings Cross in London often
 entails a change at Newark, Notts.    
 The nearest passenger port is Hull    
 where a ferry goes to Rotterdam in    
 Holland.                              
 There is a small airport at Kirmington
 which is mainly used by commercial    
 concerns. It is cheaper for villagers 
 to take a taxi from the village to    
 London Airport than for them to motor 
 down and park a car for a fortnight.  </content>
