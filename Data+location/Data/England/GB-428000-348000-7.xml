		<content> A SURVEY OF WHERE THE RELATIVES OF    
 THE CHILDREN LIVE.                    
 Most of the children's relations dont 
 live locally whereas years ago when   
 transport was not so easy people's    
 relations would live locally.         
 Only four people had relations who    
 lived locally.  Ten people had        
 relations, some of whom were          
 distant, but are all in the U.K. Two  
 people had relations who are all      
 distant but still in the U.K. Seven   
 people had relations who lived        
 abroad.                               
 When we made this survey we thought   
 that most people's relations would    
 live locally but we were wrong.  The  
 relations who live furthest from us   
 live about 12,000 miles away in New   
 Zealand.   The closest relations live 
 in the same village as us.
