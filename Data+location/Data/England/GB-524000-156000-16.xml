		<title>16What I did last Weekend</title>
		<content>  I spent last weekend with horses. On 
 Saturday, I went riding on my friend's
 pony. We came from her house in       
 Waterhouse lane up to Perrotts farm,  
 where we did some jumping in the      
 jumping alley. This is a cleared patch
 of woodland where people can make up  
 their own jumps from dead trees and   
 old branches. When we arrived back at 
 my friend's house we went for a swim  
 in the swimming pool because it was   
 such a hot day. We make assault       
 courses up for each other or have     
 diving competitions. Later on that    
 afternoon we bathed a pony that was   
 going to a show the next day. Also in 
 preparation for the show we spent the 
 rest of the day cleaning her tack,    
 4 Bridles, 3 Saddles and 2 head       
 collars. On Sunday I rose early to go 
 to Chipstead show with my friend,     
 where she was very successful.        </content>
