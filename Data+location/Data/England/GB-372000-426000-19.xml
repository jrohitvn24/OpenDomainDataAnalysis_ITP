		<content> Oswaldtwistle is named after a king.  
 The King was called Oswald and he was 
 born in 605 and defeated a Welsh King 
 Cadwallae in 633 to become King of    
 Northumbria.  England was divided into
 counties.  King Oswald was King of    
 Northumbria and he thought            
 Oswaldtwistle was his so he called it 
 Oswald_twistle.  Twistle is an old    
 name for a border, so the name means  
 King Oswald's border.
