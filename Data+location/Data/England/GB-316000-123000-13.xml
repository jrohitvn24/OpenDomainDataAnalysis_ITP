		<title>13Mr.Whittle's Farm</title>
		<content>   Mr. Whittle farms 230 acres.  Most  
 of this is for corn production, the   
 remainder being used for grazing his  
 pedigree shorthorn cattle.  This herd 
 was set up by his father in 1920, but 
 Mr. Whittle stopped milking 5 years   
 ago because of E.E.C. subsidies. His  
 calves now suckle and are sold at     
 Taunton Market.  He now uses          
 artificial insemination for breeding. 
   Due to increased labour costs he has
 also switched from the production of  
 rootcrops to wheat as this is much    
 easier to harvest.  He is still       
 short-handed though.                  
   Some winter grazing is let to sheep 
 when the cattle are taken in.  Winter 
 feed has also become much more        
 expensive and he has changed from hay 
 to sugar beet tops.
