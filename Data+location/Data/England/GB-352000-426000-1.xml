		<content>   This block is suitably,if unevenly, 
 divided into{three}parts:by the River 
 Ribble looping E to W,and containing  
 the town-centre areas of{Frenchwood   
 (and its School),Avenham and Broad-   
 gate,at the upper part of the block;  
 then,by the London-to- Glasgow main   
 railway line, which splits the block  
 into SW'ly and SE'ly suburban areas.  
  To the SW lies{Penwortham,}with King-
 sfold School. Here, housing has been  
 added to by the Central Lancs.Devel't 
 Corporation.A newly completed Western 
 Primary road services the recent urban
 growth to the S and W of Preston.     
   To the SE lies{Walton-le-Dale}(with 
 St.Leonard's School) and Bamber Bridge
 with Lostock Hall along our S'ly line 
 These areas also have had C.L.D.C.dev_
 elopments, mainly in housing and road-
 building,altering their earlier almost
 semi-rural and independent character. </content>
