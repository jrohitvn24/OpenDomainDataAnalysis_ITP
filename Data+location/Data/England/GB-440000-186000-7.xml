 On our walk from Charlton we were     
surprised to see so many houses for old
people.                                
1.St.Katharine's House is privately    
run by St. Mary's Convent(Anglican)    
There is provision for 60 ladies over  
the age of 70 and for 10 elderly nuns. 
2. In 1830 in his will Thomas Fewson   
Eagles left 1 acre of land to be used  
for building almshouses.In 1860 ten    
were erected.According to the will the 
occupants should be single,not under   
50, residents of Wantage,and not rich. 
They are administered by the Governors 
of the Town Lands.People pay rent now. 
We took harvest gifts to them last     
 year.                                 
3.Stirlings Home is run by Oxfordshire 
County Council for 30 old people who   
can wash and dress themselves but are  
not able to cook.                      </content>
