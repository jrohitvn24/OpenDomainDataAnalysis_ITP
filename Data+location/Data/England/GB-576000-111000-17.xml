		<content> The eastern part of our area is a busy
 one, with quite a lot of{through      
{traffic.}In 1985 nearly every family  
 owns one car, many have two. The main 
 London road,{A21,}passesthrough at    
 Hollington and is especially busy at  
 summer weekends. There are plans to   
 improve this road in the next few     
 years. The A2100 Ridge road forms an  
 E-W link from the eastern part of     
 Hastings. The B2159 road to Battle    
 joins this. One morning we counted 74 
 cars in 10 minutes going in one       
 direction along here.                 
 About 5 years ago{Queensway}was built,
 coming from the A21. It has made      
 travelling easier to Tesco's and the  
 Castleham Industrial Site. Soon it is 
 planned to continue Queensway to form 
 a new by-pass road to Bexhill.This new
 housing in the area means even more   
 local traffic..                       </content>
