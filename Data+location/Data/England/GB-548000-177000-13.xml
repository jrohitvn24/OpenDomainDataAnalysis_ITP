		<title>13LESNES WOODS</title>
		<content> Lesnes Woods used to be used for a    
 timber ground where they cut the trees
 down then let them grow again. Lesnes 
 is used  as a leisure place now where 
 people go to take their dogs for a    
 walk or they go for a jog. In the     
 winter it is a good place for sledging
 down the big slopes. Lesnes is a big  
 woods and it has lots of hills and    
 slopes. On a clear day you can see    
 right across to Thamesmead and a      
 little further. Attatched to Lesnes   
 Woods is Lesnes Abbey now in ruins. In
 the wood itself there are a lot of    
 wild flowers like bluebells, daffodils
 and anemones.  There are wild animals 
 too and one of the most common is the 
 grey squirrel. It can be a nuisance to
 trees by pulling the bark off. I go   
 there quite a lot to take the dog for 
 a walk . It is my favourite wood.
