  We moved here from south Bristol     
 because we like the area the people   
 are intereresting and the downs are   
 close. Our customers our very musical.
 housewives, students, young people on 
 the dole but mainly professional      
 people we also have a large passing   
 trade  attached to  the newspaper shop
 next door. There has not been much    
 change, a new cinema and "Waitrose", a
 swell housing development to replace  
 prefabs built upon bomb damage. I'm in
 the shop with my husband and my son   
 does the heavy work along with helping
 to serve. We buy vegetables from the  
 market. We have to get there at 5:45  
 a.m. to get a good place. Supplies    
 come from the U.S.A., Chile, Kenya,   
 Israel, and other countries.          
 Chrysanthamums and seasonal flowers   
 are the mainstay of our flower trade. </content>
