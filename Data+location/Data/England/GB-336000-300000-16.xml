		<content> People used to rely a lot on clouds,  
 wind and other elements for the       
 weather. News didn't travel very fast 
 because there was no T.V. or radio.If 
 smoke went up from the chimneys it was
 a sign of good weather but if it was  
 blowing about or going down chimneys  
 it was a sign of bad weather. They    
 relied a lot on animals too. If the   
 cat sat with its back to the fire, it 
 was a sign of cold weather.On the 29th
 of May children used to look for new  
 oak balls to put in their buttonholes.
 If  they didn't the others got nettles
 and went round thrashing their legs.  
 They used to play many games like     
 'Sheep, Sheep, Come Home', Hopscotch, 
 and quite a few singing games such as 
 'Oranges and Lemons' and 'Poor Jane   
 Sat a Weeping' and many others.
