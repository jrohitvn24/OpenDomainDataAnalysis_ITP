		<title>01The Ladock Valley.</title>
		<content> The Ladock Valley lies in the centre  
 of Cornwall. The{Tresilian River}runs 
 through the area and has caused the   
 'V' shaped valley to be formed. The   
 sides of the valley are largely{wooded
 whilst the land at the tops of the    
 valley sides is largely given over to 
{farming.}The area is characterised by 
 rolling countryside bordered by the   
{clay works}in the East and{Ladock     
{Woods}in the West. Much of the land is
 owned by the{Duchy of Cornwall}and is 
 leased to tenant farmers.             
 The population is scattered amongst   
 the farms; there being only one small 
 hamlet called{New Mills.}The children 
 attend schools at either{Ladock}or    
{Grampound Road.}Local shopping        
 facilities are found in these villages
 whilst{Truro}is considered the centre 
 for markets and trade. Secondary      
 children attend school at{Tregony.    </content>
