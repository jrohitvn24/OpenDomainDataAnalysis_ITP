		<title>07Red Deer of Exmoor</title>
		<content> Apart from the amazing scenery, one of
 Exmoor's greatest qualities is its    
 wildlife. The Red Deer for which      
 Exmoor is famous is Britain's largest 
 wild animal. They spend much of the   
 daytime in their woodland haunts,     
 coming out in the early morning and   
 late evening to feed in the open.     
     In early summer they usually graze
 on the open moorland. Later on in the 
 year they are more likely to be found 
 on farmland on the moorland fringes.  
     Although the Deer can be found    
 almost everywhere on Exmoor, there are
 probably more on the Somerset side of 
 the county boundary.                  
     The chance of a close-up view of  
 these Red Deer is very slight, because
 they have excellent eyesight and      
 hearing, and a highly developed sense 
 of smell.                             
                                       </content>
