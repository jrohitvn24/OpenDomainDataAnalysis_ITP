		<title>04Sandringham Church</title>
		<content> The church of St. Mary Magdalene was  
 first built in the 14th. century,     
 rebuilt in the 16th. century and      
 extensively restored in the latter    
 part of the 19th. century. It stands  
 hidden in the woodland to the West of 
 Sandringham House.                    
                                       
 Visitors are immediately aware that   
 this is a Royal Church. They are      
 amazed by the silver altar-piece and  
 pulpit, appreciative of the beautiful 
 silver processional cross, and charmed
 by the delightful statue of St. George
 slaying the Dragon which stands guard 
 over the Royal Pew.                   
                                       
 Despite its appeal to the tourist, it 
 remains the spiritual centre of the   
 Sandringham Group of Parishes, and it 
 maintains a pleasingly large Sunday   
 congregation.                         </content>
