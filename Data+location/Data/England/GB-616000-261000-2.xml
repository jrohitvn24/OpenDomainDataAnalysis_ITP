		<title>02Debenham-Farms @ Drainage.</title>
		<content>  The use of larger farm machinery has 
led to the creation of larger fields,to
make the work more convenient and      
economic.This has resulted in the      
removal of trees and hedges,to the     
detriment of wildlife.The consequent   
filling-in of ditches and pools has    
necessitated massive expenditure on    
land drains.                           
  Debenham,where four tributary streams
feed the river Deben,has always been   
subject to flooding.The loss of ditches
has resulted in more problems after    
heavy rainfall.These have been         
alleviated by digging a new,straight   
channel for the river under Thorpe Lane
which enables the water to run away    
more quickly.In 1983,a water pumping   
station was built just north of the    
village.This has helped to maintain a  
constant flow,to the benefit of aquatic
life.                                  </content>
