		<content> "The river up to the Furnace Bridge is
 tidal, which means that you have sea  
 water life up to the bridge.  The     
 river is often coloured due to        
 industrial pollution". Smaller        
 (plants) under the trees and in the   
 open spaces included: daffodils,      
 hundreds of daisies, lots of          
 buttercups, small clumps of bluebells 
 dotted on the river banks, ferns, wild
 garlic with small white flowers       
 growing on them, lots of purpley blue 
 foxgloves. In Spring time there are   
 lots of celandines.  There are clover,
 dog roses, red-campion and a few march
 marigolds.  There are patches of      
 gorse, bracken, thistle, nettles,     
 dock, butter - bur, primrose and      
 blackberry.  A lot of animals live by 
 the riverside: fox, weasles, water    
 voles, mice rabbits, moles, hedgehogs,
 red squirrels, and badgers.           </content>
