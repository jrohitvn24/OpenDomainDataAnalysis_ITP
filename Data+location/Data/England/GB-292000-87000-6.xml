		<title>06Exminster Village</title>
		<content> Exminster is a village situated five  
 miles south-east of Exeter. The       
 electoral roll for the village has    
 1,750 names. The total population is  
 probably 2,200. It has a long history 
 which goes back to Saxon times when   
 there was an Abbey on the site of the 
 present church. It is said that       
 St. Boniface went to school in this   
 Abbey before going to Germany in the  
 9th Century.                          
                                       
 In 1984 Exminster was bypassed by a   
 new road called Sannerville Road.     
 Exminster is twinned with Sannerille  
 in France. This road was built with   
 money that was given by the European  
 Economic Community. The village is now
 much quieter because there is less    
 through traffic, but the shops might  
 close because of loss of trade.
