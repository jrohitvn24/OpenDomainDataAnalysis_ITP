		<title>15SHOPPING AND FOOD SUPPLIES</title>
		<content> In this area, there are only two small
 shops selling essential groceries and 
 household items. The milk roundsman   
 will also supply dairy products, eggs,
 fruit juices, bread and potatoes,     
 which is very useful for those who are
 housebound or isolated. Other mobile  
 services include a Greengrocer, Fish- 
 monger (both weekly) and a monthly    
 Frozen Food Delivery Service. However,
 the majority of shopping is done in   
 Canterbury or nearby towns. Groceries 
 are usually bought at the large Super-
 markets which carry a wide range of   
 goods and offer parking facilities.   
 Today's trend seems to be towards bulk
 shopping once a month. The possession 
 of fridges and freezers, and the fact 
 that many workers are now salaried,   
 helps to make this possible. Meat is  
 purchased from Bridge, Barham or town,
 and some will buy in bulk for freezing</content>
