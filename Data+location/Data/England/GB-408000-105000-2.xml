		<title>02Verwood Under Development.</title>
		<content>    Verwood was identified in the 1977 
 County Structure Plan as an area      
 suitable for substantial residential  
 development.Since the mid 1970's the  
 population of the village has grown   
 from about 3000 to an estimated 7000  
 today.It is expected that it will     
 reach 12000 within ten years.         
    There is a schedule of planned     
 development,parcels of land being     
 released for building at set intervals
 of time.                              
    The dwellings vary from 8 to 12 per
 acre.Most are brick-built.The bricks  
 range from beige or cream,through     
 yellow, orange and red shades to brown
 or purplish hues.Some bungalows  and  
 houses are cement-rendered and painted
 in pastel colours.                    
    Already,the land from Eblake to    
 Pottern Farm and S.W.to Three Legged  
 Cross is built over with new housing. </content>
