		<content>{Dorothy }came to the village in 1935. 
 She lived at School House which had no
 main drainage or electricity; water   
 came from a pump.During the war women 
 were left to run most of the essential
 services.  "I was in the Fire Service"
{Sally }is Dorothy's daughter.Her first
 memories are of the 1952 Coronation   
 Day party in the Parish Room (Village 
 Hall) where every child received a    
 Coronation mug and a huge tea. "We had
 an open house and friends called to   
 see the events on our new television" 
 Now in 1985 {Madeleine, }Dorothy's    
 grand-daughter, takes computers, video
 recorders and air travel for granted. 
 She loves to play tennis at the club  
 in the village; she is a keen Brownie 
 and a member of the church choir.     
                                       
 "Fifty years have passed but has the  
 quality of life improved?"            </content>
