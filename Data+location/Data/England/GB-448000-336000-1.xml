		<content>   Our block lies on the western       
 boundary of the City of Nottingham.It 
 has been developed from the original  
 farming communities of Bramcote,      
 Stapleford, and Chilwell.             
   In the north_east sector there is   
 extensive private housing, and        
 recreational development, favoured by 
 professional people.                  
   Chilwell and Stapleford have a      
 mixture of private and public housing,
 serving a range of light and heavy    
 industries.                           
   Arable farming is disappearing under
 the continuing pressure for further   
 housing development.                  
   The Erewash valley on the west of   
 the block is a north/south routeway   
 for the M1 motorway, the London       
 Sheffield railway, and the Erewash    
 canal. The A52 provides the main      
 east/west road link through the area. </content>
