		<title>14  THE CHURCH FLAGONS</title>
		<content>     There has lately been a dispute   
between the town council and the parish
council over the ownership of 4 silver 
flagons which were bought in 1643 with 
120 pounds left by Stephen Hayward,a   
Gentleman of Faversham,in his will.    
     The Church wishes to sell the     
flagons and use the money to restore   
the church buildings.The town council  
says that the flagons do not belong to 
the Church.An entry in the Town Council
Minute Book of October 23rd 1643       
reads that the flagons should be       
for "ye use of the towne at the        
communion table" .The matter was       
taken to a rare ecclesiastical court   
where Judge John Newey Q.C., presiding,
decided that the flagons do belong to  
the Parish Church but they cannot sell 
them  for at least a year when they    
must prove that the money cannot be    
raised in any other way.               </content>
