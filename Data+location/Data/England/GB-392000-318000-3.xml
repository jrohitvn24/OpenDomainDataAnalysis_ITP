		<content>  The Wildwood Community Centre opened 
in September 1982, taking nine months  
to build.  The previous centre was old 
and falling apart.  It cost 17000      
pounds to rebuild (originally being    
offices). There are two rooms in the   
centre, the smaller costing 4 pounds   
per hour to hire and the larger 5      
pounds.                                
  About 120 people a day use the       
centre, the most popular club being    
playschool. The new community centre   
is used for all sorts of things        
besides playschool e.g. discos,        
parties, bingo, aerobics, keepfit,     
ballroom, tap and ballet dancing,      
W.I., church meetings, elections and   
wedding receptions.  The committee had 
a series of fund-raising events e.g.   
jumble sales etc. to help build the    
centre and it is mainly used by locals.
