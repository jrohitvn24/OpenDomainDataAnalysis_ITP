		<title>14Children's Recreation N/Ham</title>
		<content>Most of the children amuse themselves  
by playing imaginary games in the      
street, or at the local park,or on     
Wormwood Scrubs.There is an adventure  
playground on the Scrubs, made mainly  
from wood. The games are very similar  
all over the country. Some children    
play with bouncing balls, or           
footballs,pretending to be their       
favourite footballer.Others play with  
skipping ropes or hoops.               
In most areas clubs are set up for     
children to go to on certain evenings. 
These clubs usually provide table      
tennis,pool,snooker,rounders,cricket,  
football,board games and art and craft 
activities.Sometimes the children are  
taken to the cinema in Acton to see    
films. Children amuse themselves for   
most of the time by watching television
or video films.Many spend up to five   
hours a day watching television.       </content>
