		<title>19COLTON, STAFFORDSHIRE</title>
		<content> Colton is a small village on the north
 side of the Trent Valley in rural     
 Staffordshire. About 500 people live  
 in Colton. The village is built along 
 three main streets, two going up the  
 sides of the valley and the third     
 going towards Rugeley across the      
 Trent. There are no housing estates in
 Colton but the newer houses are built 
 in groups along four new streets. At  
 the centre of Colton where the main   
 streets meet is the village shop. This
 is a general store with a sub-post    
 office and sells all the essentials.  
 There are two public houses in Colton,
 the Dun Cow at the top of the village 
 and the Greyhound at the bottom. The  
 Greyhound was closed in 1985 for      
 extensive repairs and refitting. The  
 village hall is used for all village  
 events and is used as a youth club on 
 Tuesday evenings.                     </content>
