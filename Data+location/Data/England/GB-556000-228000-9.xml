		<content> Buses are the only means of public    
 transport since the rural branch line 
 of the railway is no longer in use.   
 The nearest tailway station to        
 Chickney is Elsenham, about 5 miles   
 away, on the main London to Cambridge 
 line. A bus runs 6 times a day between
 Cutlers Green, Saffron Walden and     
 Chelmsford. Another one runs every    
 weekday morning to London, via the    
 Thaxted/Broxted road, and returns each
 evening. Cars are relied upon for all 
 other journeys. Services from the     
 local council include the emptying of 
 dustbins and sceptic tanks. A baker   
 delivers bread to local houses 3 times
 a week. Milk is delivered every other 
 day from Staines Farm. The milk is    
 supplied by Unigate Dairies. Stansted 
 Airport, 8 miles away is due to be    
 expanded and more fully developed. At 
 present the area is very peaceful.    </content>
