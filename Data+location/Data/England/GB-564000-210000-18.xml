		<content>                                       
   The site of Great Newarks was       
mentioned in the Doomsday Book. It     
 was built in The 16th Century and is  
 a listed building.                    
   It is a large house, having two     
storeys and an attic. It is plastered  
and painted a peach colour, with a red 
tiled roof. It has two chimnmeys.      
   A moat used to run all the way      
around the house, but now only three-  
quarters of the way with a bridge over.
   There is a porch gate to the garden 
before entering the farmhouse.
