		<title>12RIDING STABLES</title>
		<content> The lady who runs the riding stables  
 is called Mrs Lee.We went and         
 interviewed her. We asked her some    
 questions about the riding stables and
 the horses and ponies they have there.
 The riding stables are called the West
 Dorset Equestrian Centre. They have 18
 horses and ponies, 8 stables and they 
 have about 10 mares and the rest are  
 geldings.They have to clean the tack  
 every time used.They have 2 rallies, 1
 for novices and 1 for seniors. They   
 make their own hay and straw. They go 
 to about 10 shows or more. To keep    
 healthy they worm the horses and      
 ponies every 6 weeks. In the winter   
 the ponies are kept out and are ridden
 every weekend for about an hour and a 
 half. The hunters are kept inside  and
 are ridden every day for  hour &amp; half.
 The blacksmith is P&amp;W. They charge    
 Â£5.00 a lesson &amp; Â£4.00 a ride.        </content>
