		<title>12MAY DAY</title>
		<content> At the school we always celebrate the 
 1st. of May.  We elect a May Queen and
 King and at 6 o'clock on a suitable   
 evening they process through the      
 village in a goat-cart, followed by   
 all the school-children.   When they  
 reach the village green the King and  
 Queen are crowned and then the        
 children dance around the Maypole.    
 Usually Kirtlington Morris Men join us
 and do some demonstration dances.     
 This is a custom which has been       
 observed for many years.              
 The Maypole dances done are:          
        Spider's Web                   
        Gipsy's Tent                   
        Barber's Pole                  
        Single Plait                   
        Double Plait                   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
