		<title>14HOW YALDING GETS THE NEWS</title>
		<content>                                       
 There is hardly a house which does not
 receive radio and television trans-   
 missions, both local and national.    
 Local radio, Radio Kent, is widely    
 used. Most houses buy a national daily
 newspaper. Local weekly papers are    
 "The Kent &amp; Sussex Courier" and the   
 "Kent Messenger", which has a local   
 news reporter in Yalding. Free weekly 
 newspapers are "Maidstone Borough     
 News" and "Adscene". Yalding has an   
 excellent parish magazine which,      
 sponsored by the Church, prints news  
 reports from all village organisa-    
 tions. Each month 800 copies are      
 printed and are distributed to every  
 house in Yalding and nearby Ladding-  
 ford. Entertainment includes          
 occasional evening discos at Yalding  
 School. Visiting hop-pickers live in  
 small hoppers' huts.                  </content>
