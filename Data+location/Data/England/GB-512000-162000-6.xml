		<title>06FRIDAYS - BY A GIRL AGED 10</title>
		<content> I wake up usually at about 06:30 but  
 don't get out of bed normally until   
 07:30.I then go downstairs for a      
 breakfast of toast and marmite,coffee 
 and sometimes cereal.After I have     
 washed,I fetch my coat and go to      
 school.                               
  Our first subject on a Friday is     
 choir which I enjoy because I love    
 singing.We then have history which is 
 followed by playtime.                 
  After playtime,we have another one of
 my favourite lessons-maths.           
  It is then lunch-time.I have school  
 dinners and so am sent into he        
 hall.When I have finished,I go out to 
 play while the people who have packed 
 lunch have theirs.The afternoon       
 lessons are P.E.,playtime,and         
 art.After these lessons,we get our    
 homework together,say goodbye to our  
 teacher and go home for the weekend.  </content>
