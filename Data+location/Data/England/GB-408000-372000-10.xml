		<title>10KING STERNDALE VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The village has hardly changed since  
 it was first established in the{13th  
{century.}Kingsterndale was once part  
 of{the Royal Forest of the Peak}and   
 its original name was Stony Dale.     
    In the centre of the village is an 
 old{Butter Cross.}It is called this   
 because people came from all around to
 sell their produce and slaves. It was 
 built for the coronation of Queen     
 Elizebeth the first.                  
    There is a small church in         
 Kingsterndale which was built in 1847.
{About 12 people use the church each   
{Sunday.                               
     Kingsterndale is usually affected 
 by the snow in winter. It has been    
 known that in 1862 the village was cut
 off for 8 weeks. Most years it is only
 cut off for a couple  of days.        
    Kingsterndale is a beautiful       
 village.                              </content>
