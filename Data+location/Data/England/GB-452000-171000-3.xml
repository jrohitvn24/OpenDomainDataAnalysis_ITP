		<content>  The area is unspoiled by{development}
 in part because of its distance from a
 large town and from industry. It is   
 largely as it was a hundred years ago.
 Minor roads are narrow and winding    
 with steep banks either side. There   
 are many{wild flowers}and an abundance
 of{animal life}here. The{climate}is   
 equable. The low farms are sheltered  
 by the hills and wooded areas. The { }
 soil is mainly gravel and chalk with {
 some peat in the woods and on the     
 Common. There is a{lime quarry}in the 
 south from which agricultural lime is 
 extracted. In the north east there is{
 clay once used for brick and tile     
 making. The{River Pang}rises in the   
 clay layers north of Frilsham and     
 flows tranquilly south the east at    
 Bucklebury Ford to join the Thames at 
 Pangbourne. The ford is very popular  
 with playing children and horseriders.</content>
