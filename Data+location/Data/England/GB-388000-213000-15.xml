		<title>15FAMILY LIFE IN BROCKWORTH</title>
		<content>Local supermarket owners and residents 
were interviewed to discover {shopping 
habits}.Potatoes and bread were the    
commodities sold most each week;tinned 
veg.,pickles and spices the least;     
chicken and braising steak were the    
most popular meats,whilst the weekend  
was the busiest time.                  
2 {average families} reported that "We 
spend 50.00 weekly for food for 4"and  
"My household spends 45.00 weekly to   
feed 4.The main things bought are bread
and potatoes".                         
As regards {housework} it was done     
mostly by women-"I asked a few         
housewives about housework.They        
said"Its horrid"". A survey found that 
the most hated tasks were              
polishing,ironing and cooking.Perhaps  
{pet ownership} caused all this        
work-about 80% of 1 typical class had  
pets.                                  </content>
