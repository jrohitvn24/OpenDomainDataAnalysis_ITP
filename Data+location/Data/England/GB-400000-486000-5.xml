		<title>05CHANGES IN VILLAGES</title>
		<content> People we interviewed were concerned  
 about some changes in village life.   
 Lack of public transport is a concern 
 to some, especially to the elderly who
 cannot drive.  They feel dependent on 
 friends and relatives. Another cause  
 for concern is the increase in the    
 number of holiday cottages and the    
 shortage of houses for young, local   
 people who cannot afford to buy       
 property which is much sought after in
 this area. There are also many people 
 retiring to live in this area and the 
 population of the villages is changing
 with fewer young families than in     
 previous generations. Many village    
 schools have closed since the 1950's. 
 4 schools used to serve this area;    
 there is now only one. There is a fear
 that in the next few years the Post   
 Offices and the remaining school may  
 close.                                </content>
