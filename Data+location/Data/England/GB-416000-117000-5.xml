		<title>05HALE VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content>  THE VILLAGE HALL WAS BUILT IN 1931 TO
 PROVIDE SOCIAL, EDUCATIONAL AND REC-  
 REATIONAL FACILITIES FOR THE PEOPLE   
 OF HALE AND DISTRICT.  IT IS REGISTER-
 ED AS A CHARITY.                      
  HALE PLAYGROUP, WHICH CATERS FOR     
 CHILDREN UNDER FIVE, USES THE HALL ON 
 MOST MORNINGS OF THE WEEK AND THE     
 PRIMARY SCHOOL USES IT FOR PHYSICAL   
 EDUCATION.                            
  ALSO USING THE HALL ON A REGULAR     
 BASIS ARE THE KEEP_FIT CLUB, THE      
 CRICKET CLUB, THE WOMAN'S INSTITUTE,  
 THE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY,  THE KUNG- 
 FU CLUB AND THE WINE CIRCLE.          
  THE TOTAL INCOME FOR 1984 WAS APPROX-
 IMATELY Â£3000, BUT THIS WILL BE LOWER 
 IN 1985. DISCOS, WHICH IN 1982        
 BROUGHT IN ABOUT Â£1500, ARE NO LONGER 
 POPULAR, AND SUPPORT FOR WHIST DRIVES 
 IS ALSO DECLINING.
