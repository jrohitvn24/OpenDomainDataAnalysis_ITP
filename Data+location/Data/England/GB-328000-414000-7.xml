		<title>07RESIDENT'S VIEW S'PORT 1985</title>
		<content> Southport now is a dormitory town and 
 most people commute to larger towns   
 such as Liverpool and Manchester.     
 Although it is a seaside resort it has
 not yet decided which tourist market  
 to settle with.The new rides at the   
 fairground attract the younger tourist
 but the resident felt that more       
 amenities were needed for the young   
 people who live in Southport.Since    
 Southport is so flat,it has always    
 been popular as a resort for the      
 elderly and many make it their home.  
 More and more of the large Victorian  
 houses are being converted to homes   
 for the elderly,and retirement flats  
 are being built all over the town.On  
 reflection the resident felt that as  
 public transport is excellent,all the 
 shops are centrally situated and      
 public services are good,Southport is 
 an ideal residential area.            </content>
