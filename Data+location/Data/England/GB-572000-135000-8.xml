		<title>08Trade opinions,By-pass idea.</title>
		<content>We surveyed most of the shops in the   
village to find their opinions on the  
traffic problems. The majority were not
in favour of any changes as they       
thought the narrow road, parked cars   
and awkward corners caused traffic to  
go slowly and carefully. When a nearly 
motorway is completed it is expected   
that less heavy container lorries will 
need to come through Goudhurst. It was 
considered by many shopkeepers that the
proposed by-pass would take trade away 
from the villge. Tourists would still  
be attracted to the area for its       
architecture and history, also by the  
tea rooms and inns. Goudhurst is noted 
for its good food, and is the nearest  
village of any size to many popular    
places such as Bedgebury Pinetum,      
Finchcocks museum of musical           
instruments, Bewl Vallley Water and    
Goudhursts historic church.            </content>
