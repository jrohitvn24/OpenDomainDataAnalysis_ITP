		<title>17HOUSING.</title>
		<content>   Most of the housing in the area is  
 large, detached. It is built of       
 sandstone, the local building         
 material, with rendering, stone flags,
 slates or tiles for roofing. The land 
 itself belongs to the local farmers,  
 landowners and householders.          
   Most houses seemed to have quite a  
 large area of land; used either as    
 private gardens or market gardens.    
   Many of the older properties have   
 been beautifully renovated in an      
 appropriate way. Throughout the area  
 studied we found several hamlets, but 
 no villages or towns.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
