 3 Inland water.                       
{RIVERS.} There is one small river, the
 Roding, a tributary of the Thames. It 
 supports much wild life - heron,      
 kingfisher, mussels and fish.         
{PONDS.}There are several ponds, mostly
 in association with farms. One pond   
 near Fitzjohns, is the home of a pair 
 of mute swans. {                      
{RESERVOIR. }A private reservoir of    
 just over 3 acres was constructed on  
 New Hall Farm in 1984. Water is pumped
 into it during the winter from a      
 tributary of the river Roding. The    
 water is used in summer for irrigation
 of crops particularly potatoes and    
 rape.
