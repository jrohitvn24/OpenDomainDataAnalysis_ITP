		<title>10NEW INN,5 LANES END,NEEDWOOD</title>
		<content> This inn, originally known as the     
 Mosley Arms Inn, was built for the use
 of farm workers from the large estates
 in the area.  It is now owned by Bass 
 Brewery.                              
                                       
 As well as the usual{bar}and{lounge,  
 there is a{wine bar}and a{restaurant. 
 Since the inn is distant from the     
 local villages, there is not a lot of 
 local trade.                          
                                       
 However people from Burton upon Trent 
 and other local villages come out for 
 a meal, especially at weekends, and   
 there is a{large car park}to cater for
 this trade.                           
                                       
 The inn provides part time{employment 
 for a small number of people from the 
 area.                                 
                                       </content>
