		<content> There are two garages in Clive, one   
 is situated opposite the Village shop 
 in the main street.This garage sells  
 drinks and car oils and acessories.   
 The other one is situated near the    
 doctor's surgery and is rented from   
 its present owner, Mr Mottershead,    
 who is also the owner of a garage in  
 Wem.                                  
 The garage does not now sell petrol   
 and just does servicing and repairs of
 vehicles. The premises are also used  
 to sell frozen foods such as pies and 
 vegetables, chips, ice-cream and also 
 some household goods.
