		<content> There is no doctor ,nurse ,dentist or 
 hospital in Bassenthwaite. The nearest
 are about 7 miles away.               
 Bassenthwaite gets its water from     
 Hausegill. The water from Hausebeck   
 runs down onto the filter beds. The   
 filters are controlled by ball cocks. 
 There are gabions there to block the  
 water from coming into the filter beds
 when there is a storm. In the filter  
 beds are layers of sand, gravel and   
 stone. The sand is washed once in a   
 fortnight. They add chlorine to the   
 water to keep out the germs. Pumps are
 not needed because it goes down hill  
 all the way. At Hausegill there is an 
 alarm which rings when anything goes  
 wrong. Hausebeck runs into Dashbeck   
 which runs through Bassenthwaite      
 Village as Halls Beck.
