		<title>12King's Farm, Wendover</title>
		<content> The actual farm has existed in Nash   
Lee Road for 70 years and the present  
owners have worked it for 32 years     
during which time it has been          
modernised.   The family run a farm    
shop selling meat, eggs, poultry and   
home produced food. About 200 people   
use the shop, which is open five days  
a week. There are 5000 hens housed and 
five rearing sheds and eggs are        
 ollected and graded by machine. The   
 ings keep 30 breeding cows each of    
which produce 2 litters of about one   
dozen piglets a year. All are bred for 
pork and pork-based meat.              
About 28 cattle are kept and all the   
beasts on the site are slaughtered     
elsewhere before being returned for    
butchery.                              
 This thriving business may lose trade 
if the proposed bypass cuts off        
through-traffic.                       </content>
