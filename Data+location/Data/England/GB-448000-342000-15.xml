		<title>15  The Nuthall Hog Fayre</title>
		<content>   The Hog Fayre is held in a field off
 back lane, every year. A pig is       
 roasted on a spit and slices of meat  
 are sold. There are stalls and raffles
 and games like skittles. There's a    
 game where you try to get a hoop over 
 a bottle which has money inside. If   
 you win then you get the money.       
   There's a snack bar which is pulled 
 along by a horse. The snack bar sells 
 biscuits, buns, cold drinks and lots  
 of other things.                      
   There are also Morris dancers at the
 Fayre. The ladies dance on wooden     
 boards while a man plays an accordian.
 The dancers have bells on their ankles
 and flowers round their hats. They    
 carry Sticks which have ribbons on.   
   An aeroplane flies over the Fayre,  
 and if you guess its height then you  
 win a ride in it.
