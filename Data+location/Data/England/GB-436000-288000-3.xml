		<title>03EMPLOYMENT IN THE AREA.</title>
		<content> Although there is high unemployment in
 the area(see below) there is usually  
 one member of a family lucky enough to
 have a job.                           
  Families without a job will still    
 have some money (e.g. Social Security 
 money) for essential provisions. Most 
 men who are in employment work in     
 factories.Many men travel to Coventry 
 (8 miles away) to work.The largest    
 employer in our area is Serling       
 Metals Factory(1400 workers). Lorry   
 driving is the next popular job. The  
 majority of women in the area are     
 housewives, although most who are in  
 employment, work in clothing          
 factories. 15.3% of the work force in 
 Nuneaton are unemployed. There are    
 3893 men unemployed(17.2%) and 2077   
 women without a job(12.4%). These     
 figures are above the national        
 unemployment figures.(July 1985)      </content>
