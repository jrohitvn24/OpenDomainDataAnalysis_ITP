		<content> A survey was taken involving 50 people
 about their pastimes.  Some people    
 were found to take part in active     
 pastimes but others simply did things 
 to fill their time.                   
 The survey consisted of questions     
 asking what was their favourite       
 pastime, where they did it and how    
 often they did it.                    
 For example only one person did       
 ballet, two did dancing, and one did  
 singing.                              
 Fishing was four peoples pastime and  
 tennis and squash had five and three  
 people respectively.                  
 The less popular pastimes turned out  
 to be knitting,karate,watching videos,
 Bingo, keep fit, Joggng, wine making, 
 Theatre_going, concert_going,         
 motor_maintainence, computer studies  
 and socialising which all had only    
 one participant.                      </content>
