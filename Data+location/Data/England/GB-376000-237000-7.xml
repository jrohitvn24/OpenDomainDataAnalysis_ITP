		<content>     The village of{Welland}is situated
 on the crossroads of the A41O4 and the
 B42O8.  The Pheasant Inn is marked on 
 old maps of the area; the church of   
 St James was consecrated in 1876 (the 
 original church was a mile to the     
 East) and the growth of the village   
 dates from this time.  The primary    
 school opened in the same year and in 
 September 1985 had 99 pupils (expected
 to rise to 12O by July 1986).         
     The original buildings were mainly
 farms and agricultural cottages but   
 these have been joined by more modern 
 houses. {The population of the village
{has doubled since 198O}with the       
 construcion of 3 new housing estates. 
 There is a large village hall with a  
 recreation ground behind, a thriving  
 village shop and a couple of garages. 
 There is no street lighting or gas    
 supply.                               </content>
