		<title>12ATTITUDES IN PARR.</title>
		<content>      We  went  around  the area to ask
 people what  their  attitudes  were on
 different  topics.  We  asked  them :-
  1."What do  you  think of  the recent
 miners strike?". Out  of 26  people  9
 said it was a waste of  time,  nothing
 was gained, 5 agreed with it, the rest
 were undecided.                       
  2."What  do  you   think  of  housing
 provision  in  this  area?". Out of 24
 interviewed 12  said  terrible, 7 said
 they weren't  too bad, 5  people  said
 they particularly  disliked  the three
 storey town houses.                   
  3."What  do  you  think  of the local
 council?".   19    people    expressed
 discontent   while  others  said   the
 council weren't bothered.             
  4."If you had  the  choice, would you
 move  to  another  area?". 12 said yes
 they would, the rest said no.
