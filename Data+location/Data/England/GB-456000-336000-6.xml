		<content>    {West Bridgford}is an area where   
 there are a lot of houses. A hundred  
 years ago, there was just a little    
 village around St. Giles' Church. Then
 land was sold for building houses and 
 long, straight, tree-lined roads were 
 made with houses on each side.        
 Gradually, more and more land on the  
 edges of the village was built on.    
    Near our school is one of the later
 estates called{Abbey Park.}All the    
 roads are named after abbeys. Most of 
 the houses are detached and they are  
 on short curved roads.                
    There is still new building being  
 done on one side of West Bridgford    
 where large detached houses are being 
 built. This area is called Tordean    
 Park after two Nottingham people who  
 won the World Ice Dancing gold medals 
 in 1984.
