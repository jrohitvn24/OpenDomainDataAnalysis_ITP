		<title>02BOXWORTH - HOUSING</title>
		<content> Houses in Boxworth come in four       
 categories; Council rented, private   
 rented, owner occupied and tied. Of   
 the 65 houses, one third are owner    
 occupied, one third tied, 15% Council 
 and the remainder private rented.     
 House building in the past thirty     
 years has been confined to "infill",  
 owner occupied housing. Council       
 housing tends to be terraced. Owner   
 occupied houses built in recent years 
 tend to be large compared to other    
 village houses but most conform to the
 overall style of houses in Boxworth.  
 No major house building projects have 
 been contemplated,Boxworth has not    
 rated a mention in the County         
 Structure Plan of the 1980's.
