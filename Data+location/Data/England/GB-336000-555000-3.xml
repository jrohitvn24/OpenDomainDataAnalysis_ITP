		<title>03TRANSPORT AND CARLISLE</title>
		<content>  Transport is important to Carlisle.  
 Until the mid 18th century the city   
 was cut off;to the North was an enemy 
 border,to the West the sea and to the 
 East and South mountains.Carlisle was 
 usually reached by sea,from Liverpool.
 In 1763 improved roads allowed the    
 first stagecoach to cross the mount-  
 ains.In 1823 a canal from the coast to
 the city was opened&lt;p.4>so that the   
 sea-route remained the quickest.It was
 intended to extend the canal to       
 Newcastle but the newly developing    
 railways replaced other forms of      
 transport by mid 19th century&lt;p.5>.   
  The link with the rest of England is 
 still very important.Carlisle has a   
 small airport,recently reopened,but   
 since 1970 it has been the M6 motorway
 which has brought business and tourism
 into the region.
