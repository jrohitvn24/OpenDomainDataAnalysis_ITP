 Farming is the biggest employer in    
 our area. Farms produce enough milk to
 supply the people in our area and     
 enough to send away. The main crop is 
 grass which is used for silage and the
 farms are mostly mixed.There is quite 
 a lot of meat produced from the       
 farms.Most of the farmhouses in the   
 area are quite old but they are       
 gradually being replaced by more      
 modern buildings. Equipment is also   
 being modernised for example herring  
 bone milking parlours are now very    
 popular.Hurdon Farm is quite a large  
 farm near Launceston. It has a large  
 amount of livestock including cows,   
 sheep,and pigs.There are 5 farm       
 labourers as well as the farmer and   
 his family.They have 10 tractors ,3   
 silage harversters and a combine.     </content>
