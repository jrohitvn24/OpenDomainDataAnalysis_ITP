		<content>      There are two residential        
 policemen who cover l6 hours a day.   
 They patrol on foot or pedal cycle.   
 There is overall cover from           
 Pocklington.  Superimposed on that is 
 traffic cover.  Support is given from 
 sub-divisional H.Q. in Goole.  The    
 base for the dog and horse section is 
 l0 miles away at Walkington.          
      Not a lot of serious crime as a  
 fairly good standard of living in the 
 area.  Mainly burglaries and assaults.
  Assaults are usually by young folk in
 l7-25 age range when drunk or are of a
 domestic nature.  Glue sniffing seems 
 to have died out and drug taking is   
 not a big problem.                    
      Market Weighton Police Station is
 now used solely as a Magistrates Court
 which meets once a fortnight.  More   
 serious crimes are dealt with at      
 Beverley, York and Leeds.             </content>
