		<title>01Upper Strensham District</title>
		<content>   Upper Strensham, Worcestershire is a
 small village lying between the River 
 Avon and the River Severn. The        
 Gloucestershire border marks the      
 southern boundary. The land           
 surrounding the village is used mainly
 for mixed farming with arable crops   
 predominating. There is also a        
 considerable amount of common land.   
   The village is bypassed by the M5   
 and Strensham service area is         
 immediately north of the village and  
 the M50-M5 junction is just south of  
 it. The A38 runs through the south    
 west section of the district. Severn  
 Trent have a plant and filter beds    
 near the Avon, and a pipeline carries 
 water over it to Bredon Hill.         
   Our block includes small sections of
 Ripple, Bredon. The part of Twyning   
 covered by it has the only dense      
 housing in the area.                  </content>
