		<title>08LEVINGTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content>   The old church and the  Ship Inn    
are next to each other and nearer the  
creek than the rest of the village.    
Levington  Creek was once used for     
smuggling and by barges. Thames        
Sailing Barges used to bring stone and 
gravel to the wharf at the head of the 
creek. The stone and gravel were used  
to repair the roads. Today the creek is
silted up. The village green is the    
smallest registered in  England. Most  
of the houses in Levington are spread  
along the main road because the        
survivors of the Black Death moved     
away from  the infected area by the    
church. When Fisons built their        
laboratories at Levington they also    
built an estate of houses for their    
workers. When Norsk Hydro bought the   
premises, they sold the houses. There  
are no shops in the village, and the   
nearest Primary School is at Nacton.   </content>
