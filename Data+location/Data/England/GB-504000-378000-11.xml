		<title>11ON SHORE OIL IN LINCOLNSHIRE</title>
		<content> In the summer of 1985 the landscape of
 the area near Reasby was transformed  
 by the erection of an oil drilling    
 rig. Oil workers, more used to working
 in the North Sea or the Gulf, found   
 themselves temporarily in the         
 Lincolnshire countryside.             
                                       
 Directional drilling was employed and 
 three holes were drilled to a depth of
 1700m. and a distance of 500m. from   
 the wellhead. After removal of the    
 rig, a nodding donkey and storage     
 tanks were installed. The extraction  
 process will be fully automatic.      
 It is hoped that 700 barrels of oil a 
 day will be produced for the next     
 twenty years. The oil will be removed 
 by tanker to a nearby storage depot   
 from where it will go by train to     
 South Wales for processing.
