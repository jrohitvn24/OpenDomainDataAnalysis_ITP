		<content> Hetton Swimming baths were erected in 
 1970 and are situated in the town     
 centre. It comprises a{25 metre pool, 
{teaching pool}and cafeteria. A modern 
 sauna suite was built as an annex to  
 the baths in 1974. Presently, 17 staff
 are employed in the whole complex. The
 pools are used by all age groups and  
 are extremely popular especially in   
 the school holidays. People travel    
 from the neighbouring area to the     
 facilities. To keep the children      
 entertained there are giant           
 inflatables.{Swimming Clubs}exist for 
{chidren, adults}and{old age           
{pensioners.}One memorable occasion was
 when the "Swim along with Wilkie"     
 event took place. Changes hoped for in
 the future include the provision of a 
 keep fit room and a sports hall.
