		<title>05Fryerning - a personal view</title>
		<content> Fryerning is very quiet, with hardly  
 any traffic passing through. Instead  
 vehicles travel on the A12 by-pass    
 running parallel to Mill Green Road   
 which cuts through Fryerning.         
 Social life is poor for the younger   
 generation. There are the pubs but no 
 discos, parties or youth clubs. For   
 community activities like sport and   
 social functions one has to travel to 
 Ingatestone or Brentwood (about six   
 miles away). There is nothing to do in
 Fryerning except to walk about in the 
 countryside, tend horses, ramble or go
 to tea with a next-door neighbour.    
 Traffic can often be heard from the   
 dual carriageway along with the noise 
 of aeroplanes from above.             
 There are no public buildings in the  
 area though there is a water tower, a 
 windmill and a few riding             
 establishments.                       </content>
