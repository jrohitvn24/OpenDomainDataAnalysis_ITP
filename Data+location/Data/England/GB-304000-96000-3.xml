 The first reference to schooling in   
 Whimple apppears in 1798 when there   
 were appparently 3 or 4 Dame schools. 
 In 1818 there was a school of 48      
 children.The present day school       
 started life in 1848 under the name of
 "Whimple National School" and was     
 built at the cost of Â£475.            
 It comprised of a teacher's house and 
 a single schoolroom.                  
 In 1870 the schoolroom was enlarged   
 and an infant classroom added. By 1910
 the school had been enlarged again    
 with a further room being added. It   
 had by now achieved its resent two    
 modern mobile classrooms which are    
 quite separate from the main school   
 buildings.
