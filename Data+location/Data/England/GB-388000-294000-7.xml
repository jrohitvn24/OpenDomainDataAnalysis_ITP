		<title>07Recreation on Penn Common</title>
		<content>Penn Common is a very large area,      
mostly used as a golf course. Also,    
there are many public footpaths, some  
which lead round the course. The       
remainder which isnt used as a golf    
course is used as grazing land for     
cattle. Recently, an incident occured  
 here golfers were using cattle of a   
 localfarmer for target practice.      
 He has complained to the golf club    
to leave him enough land for grazing   
while the golf club are trying to stop 
him from grazing his cattle on the     
fairways. Along the paths we went on   
there was one inn,"The Barley Mow". I  
like Penn Common and think we are lucky
to have a large area of common land    
near a town. The golf course takes up  
52 of the 132 acres, there are mixed   
opinions in my class whether the golf  
course should be reduced in size in    
years to come.                         </content>
