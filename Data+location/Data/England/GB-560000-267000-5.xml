		<title>05The Scrap Yard, Snailwell</title>
		<content>   {Mayer Newman}buy, process and sell 
 different grades of scrap metal to    
 steelmakers in Britain and abroad.They
 have 3 main ways of producing the     
 scrap. Light iron from cookers,       
 bicycles and cars is shredded into    
 pieces.Heavy steel from farm machinery
 and construction girders are cut into 
 smaller pieces by huge hydraulic      
 shears. They have a special machine   
 called a{Burning Tunnel}which is for  
 railway carriages which contain       
 poisonous blue asbestos linings. All  
 the smoke, fumes and debris are       
 trapped in the machine, then sealed   
 and disposed of at a special tip. All 
 the scrap is then weighed and sold. It
 is despatched by lorry. If it is being
 sent to Europe and Scandinavia, it is 
 transported by boat from Norwich      
 through the local port of Great       
 Yarmouth.                             </content>
