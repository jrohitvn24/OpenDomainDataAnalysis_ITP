		<content> On Tuesday 16th July 1985 St. Mary's  
 held their Sports Day on Eccles'      
 Recreation Ground. The first event was
 the 50m. This was followed by the 80m 
 and the 100m. All these races were run
 on the straight.                      
 By this time Sherwin Team was in first
 place with 45 pts. The next event was 
 the 200m which was one lap around the 
 track. Then it was time for the boys' 
 800m followed by the girls' 800m.     
 Sherwin won both races.               
 Then it was time for the three-legged 
 race, followed by the sack race and   
 the obstacle race. This was the most  
 amusing race of all. The final race   
 (which could have altered the points a
 lot) was the relay race.              
                                       
 The final places were: Sherwin 1st,   
 Barlow 2nd, Arrowsmith 3rd and        
 Southworth 4th.                       </content>
