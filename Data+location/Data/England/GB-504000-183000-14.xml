		<title>14Law and Order in Uxbridge</title>
		<content> The crime rate in Uxbridge is going   
 down.A recent article in the Gazette  
 said that the crime rate had improved 
 by 23%.The Police have encouraged     
 people to look after their property   
 better by securing their homes more   
 carefully.The Neighbourhood Watch     
 Scheme has encouraged a community     
 spirit to fight crime.The Substance   
 Abuse Unit has been set up to help    
 people suffering from drug and        
 substance addiction,which can lead to 
 crime.The nearest police station is   
 in Windsor Street.There is a County   
 Court and a Magistrates court in our  
 area.On the RAF camp the Ministry of  
 Defence police keep order.Security is 
 very strict on the camp and all       
 visitors in cars must report to the   
 main gate on arrival.
