		<title>04A LUSTON FARMER'S DAY</title>
		<content> I get up out of bed at 6 o'clock and  
 have a cup of coffee and go and get   
 the cows into the{milking}parlour by  
 6.30a.m.By then Dennis, who is my     
{dairyman,}comes and takes care of the 
 milking.Everything in the{dairy}must  
 be spotlessly clean.Then I do the     
 mucking out,feed the calves and the   
 cows after they have been milked.At   
 about 8.00a.m.I have my breakfast. I  
 also do my business calls on the      
 telephone at this time.On Mondays I   
 take the barren cows to{Ludlow market.
 After I've finished I come and have my
 dinner.At this time of year, being    
 July,I am busy{harvesting}the hay.By  
 4.00p.m.the cows have been collected  
 and are ready for milking.My tea is   
 normally ready by about 6.00p.m.If the
 weather has been fine during the day, 
 the hay harvesting continues in the   
 evening.                              </content>
