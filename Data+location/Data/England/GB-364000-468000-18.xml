		<content> There are three schools in the        
 district. There is a Primary School in
 both High and Low Bentham and an      
 independent Secondary School with a   
 Prep Dept called Bentham Grammar      
 School. The latter is located in Low  
 Bentham. The Headmaster is R.S.       
 Repper. He has a staff of 32 and 300  
 pupils. Of these about 50% are        
 boarders. The school, founded in 1715,
 occupies the site of a former Rectory 
 close by Low Bentham Church. Low
