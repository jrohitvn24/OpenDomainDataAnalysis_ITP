		<title>04TRANSPORT AND TRAFFIC</title>
		<content> In the area we had to investigate     
 for the project that we were doing.   
 We carried out two traffic counts     
 in Sproatley and Bilton,each for 1 hr.
 For our investigation we had to       
 count cars going several directions.  
 The traffic in Bilton was quite busy  
 but the traffic in Sproatley wasn't   
 quite as busy as the traffic in       
 Bilton.It was mostly cars and vans    
 with a few vehicles such as motorbikes
 and tractors.Altogether we counted    
 nearly two hundred cars, nine or ten  
 buses and forty trucks.There was not  
 a lot of other vehicles compared to   
 the number of vehicles that travel in 
 a City. The traffic in Bilton was     
 quite busy because it is the main road
 between Hull and Withernsea.          
 In Sproatley the traffic was very     
 quiet and there were some minutes in  
 our count when no vehicles went past. </content>
