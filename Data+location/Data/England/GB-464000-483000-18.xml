		<content> The Domesday Project.                 
       The information used in this    
 survey was collected by pupils at     
 Ryedale Comprehensive School. Pupils  
 who live within the D block were      
 invited to take part in the project   
 and undertook the land cover and      
 amenity surveys and conducted many    
 interviews. As far as possible,  a    
 good representative sample of local   
 people were interviewed. Over one     
 hundred interviews were conducted.
