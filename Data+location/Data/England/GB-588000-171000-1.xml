		<title>01QUEENBOROUGH - a summary</title>
		<content>    The river and tidal mud flats in   
 our area are under the jurisdiction of
 Medway Ports Authority. The rural     
 marshes of Chetney and Sheppey are    
 used mainly for animal grazing.       
   {Queenborough,}with a population of 
 6000, is a large industrial village.  
 There are some small new developments 
 but much of its terraced housing is   
 pre-1914. Some of the houses are much 
 older and steeped in naval history.   
 The church dates from the 14thC.      
    The large, mainly council, estate  
 of{Rushenden}has its own parade of    
 shops and community centre.           
    The old village of{Westminster}has 
 been demolished and is now a lorry    
 park and imported car holding yard.
