		<content>The Parish church of St.Peter and      
St.Paul stands by the junction of      
Church Hill and Church Street.         
Christianity was brought to these parts
by St.Aidan from the North. Historians 
differ in their opinions of when the   
first church was built.Some say the    
seventh century some the ninth. This   
first building was burnt down by the   
Danes in the tenth century.The engraved
shaft of a Saxon stone cross dated     
850BC which was found under the chancel
when the church was restoredin 1884 and
 now on display inside the church,is   
probably a relic from the first church.
Another church was built in the        
eleventh century but this was also     
burnt down by the Danes. The third     
church was built in early Norman times 
and he present one dates from the early
fourteenth century.The upper part of   
the tower contains the bell chamber    </content>
