 ONLY 2.5 MILES FROM THE WINFRITH      
 ATOMIC ENERGY RESEARCH ESTABLISHMENT  
 MEANS THAT INHABITANTS MAKE EVERY     
 EFFORT TO OPPOSE ANY FUTURE           
 DEVELOPMENT OF THIS SITE. THE{HEAVY}  
 TRAFFIC ON THE{A352}CAUSES MUCH       
 CONCERN,AND THE OLDER SCHOOL          
 CHILDREN MUST FOR SAFETY,BE PICKED UP 
 ON THE NEAR SIDE OF THE ROAD. AN ARMY 
 VEHICLE RECENTLY DEMOLISHED OUR BUS   
 SHELTER ON THIS ROAD. A SPEED         
 LIMIT,BOTH THERE AND IN THE VILLAGE IS
 DESIRABLE,AS ARE STREET LIGHTS AND    
 FURTHER PAVEMENTS.GAS IS NOW BEING    
 INSTALLED IN OWERMOIGNE.              
     TENSION BETWEEN THE YOUTH AND THE 
 ELDERLY INHABITANTS HAS LED TO THE    
 FORMATION OF{TWO}TEENAGE YOUTH GROUPS 
 THIS YEAR.THERE IS A STRONG FEELING   
 FOR THE{PRESERVATION}OF TREES AND     
 WILDLIFE OF THE VILLAGE.              </content>
