		<title>15Starting my day at School.</title>
		<content>  I arrived at 8.45am. and went into my
classroom to hang up my coat.I am a boy
and I am ten years old.My teacher was  
in the classroom getting some books    
out. I said "Good morning", and went   
out into the playground.I met some     
friends and we carried on our game of  
marbles from yesterday. Last week I won
34 marbles including 4 King Dobs.After 
that I had just enough time for one go 
at British Bulldog before the bell     
rang. Time to go in.                   
  I walked into the classroom and sat  
down at my table. I was about to start 
some writing that I had not finished   
yesterday when my friend reminded me   
that this morning it was "Radio        
Assembly" time to go into the hall. We 
were going to sing some hymns, listen  
to a story and say a prayer. My day was
about to start.                        
                                       </content>
