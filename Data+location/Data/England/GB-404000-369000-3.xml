 The two remaining quarries are owned  
 by{Tarmac Roadstone. Hillhead quarry  
 is used as a transport storage depot  
 and workshop. In June this year there 
 was an exhibition of quarrying        
 equipment which attracted people from 
 as far away as Australia and          
 Singapore. It was the largest quarry  
 plant show in the world.              
 The exhibition was organised by the   
{Institute of Quarrying}and will be    
 staged at Hillhead every two years    
 as Tarmac have been so helpful and    
 have turned part of their quarry into 
 a permanent site for the exhibition.  
 It was a trade show but many Buxton   
 people attended as so many are        
 employed in the industry.             
 Part of the quarry is used to make    
 concrete blocks &amp; tile by{Forticrete.
