		<title>12GODSHILL SHOW</title>
		<content> Godshill and District Horticultural   
 Society holds its 72nd Summer Show of 
 Fruit, Flowers and Vegetables this    
 year. By kind permission of local     
 farmers it has been held in various   
 fields around the village where the   
 new Telephone Exchange and various    
 housing estates now stand. In 1952 the
 Society acquired its own field in the 
 centre of the village. Entries        
 increased over the years to a peak in 
 the 1950's of nearly a thousand, but  
 have since declined to the present    
 level of between 400 and 500 in 158   
 classes. Support iin the early years  
 came mainly from neighbouring         
 villagers who came in the evening     
 after work and joined in the evening  
 sports. Now support is mainly from    
 holiday visitors during the afternoon,
 who besides the Show, enjoy the       
 Children's Fancy Dress and Sports.    </content>
