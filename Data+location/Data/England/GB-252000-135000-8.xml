		<title>08MARWOOD S. GARDEN CENTRE</title>
		<content>    Ashford Garden Center is situated  
 just off the main road between        
 Barnstaple and Braunton .It has been  
 there 17 years and covers 2 acres of  
 ground .It sells mainly plants but    
 also green houses, out door wendy     
 houses,garden sheds,fencing,tools and 
 wheelbarrows. Garden furniture,       
 compost, peat,fertilizers and         
 pesticides are also sold.             
    The most unusual indoor plant we   
 saw to buy was the Venus Flytrap,that 
 closes up when touched.               
    Sunday is the busiest day and      
 people tend to treat garden centre    
 shopping as something different from  
 weekly shopping.Roughly 30,000 people 
 visit the centre each year and it is  
 one of the only places in the block   
 which employs more than a couple of   
 people.                               
                                       </content>
