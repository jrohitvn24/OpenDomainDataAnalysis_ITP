		<content>         {ST.ANDREW'S CHURCH}          
         {++++++++++++++++++           
  There has been a church on this site 
 in North Kilworth since before 1200.  
  The present church stands as it was  
 after an extensive restoration and    
 extension in the 1870s.At that time   
 the East aisle was added.The arches on
 the West side of the nave are much    
 older,possibly C13th.                 
  The pulpit,of painted oak(red and    
 blue),is called "The Armada Pulpit",  
 tradition has it that it came from a  
 Spanish galleon,or that is was built  
 from a galleon's timbers.             
  The tower has six bells,and the best 
 stained glass in the church.Â£20,000   
 was raised by 1983 to repair the spire
  The organ was renovated in 1984.     
  The Rector is the Rev.d S.W.Doggett  
 M.B.E.,T.D.,M.A.,at present Rural Dean
 of the Guthlaxton II Deanery.         </content>
