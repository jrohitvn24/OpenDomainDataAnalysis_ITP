		<title>16TALES OF OLD ASHBY CONTD.</title>
		<content>  In 1827 the Market Cross in Market   
 Street was pulled down.It is believed 
 that two residents Mr Woolet and John 
 Eames arrived at the dead of night    
 after the nightwatchman had passed and
 fastened chains round the pillers of  
 the Cross,fixing them to their horses.
 With much encouragement the Cross came
 down.The noise awakened most people   
 except a Mr Proudman_he was wakened by
 a neighbour throwing stones at his    
 bedroom window.The call went out "Get 
 up,get up they have taken down the    
 Market Cross".                        
  Mr Proudman got up very quickly, in  
 fact too quickly, for in his great    
 hurry to get up he fell downstairs and
 broke his neck.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
