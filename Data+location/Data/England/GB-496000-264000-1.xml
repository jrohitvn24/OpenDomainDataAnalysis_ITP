		<title>01 Our `D' Block</title>
		<content>  This Â£D' block is situated in east   
Northants, with the Bedfordshire       
boundary crossing the S.E.square. The  
county towns of Northampton and Bedford
provide major centres (15-20miles away)
although Wellingborough and Kettering  
are also important.                    
  The region falls mostly in Rushden's 
parish, containing many aspects which  
were studied i.e. industry, schools,   
housing and some services (these were  
to the east of the town.)              
  The N.W. Km square contains Rushden's
suburbs, the remaining area being      
mostly farmland.                       
  Housing is dispersed except for      
development along important roads, and 
the isolated village of Newton         
Bromswold, making transport a vital    
commodity.
