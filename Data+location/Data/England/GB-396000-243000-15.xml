 have speakers on a number of topics.  
 Extra courses are available in Arts   
 and Crafts. This branch has a choir.  
{An Adult Village Choir}practises      
 weekly and sings in the church on     
 occasions. Their social group arranges
 outings to concerts and the theatre.  
{Members of the Flower Guild}decorate  
 the Church on a weekly rota, but all

 the Annual Walkabout, as do the

 painting, paper sculpture,            
 calligraphy, glass engraving, and     
 woodcarving. Some of these craftsmen  
 hold classas independently in the     
 area.
