		<title>13WOODLAND IN OUR DISTRICT</title>
		<content> The first{wood}we went to was a       
 private wood on Green Lane North. The 
 area of the wood was 5670 metres      
 square. We measured and estimated the 
 size, most of the trees were          
{deciduous}but a few were coniferous.  
 There were silver birch, oak, field   
 maple, holly, white poplar, hazel,    
 elderberry and ash. We then went to   
 another wood that was situated in Gt. 
 Plumstead, that wood was private as   
 well. There was a medieval hedgerow   
 running through the wood; the wood    
 covered about three acres. The trees  
 were mainly deciduous. About 50 trees 
 were cut down a year. The{disease}that
 they had had most was Dutch Elm       
 Disease. The{animals}that lived there 
 mainly were foxes, squirrels, birds,  
 rabbits and pheasants. The woods also 
 contained Beech and Sycamore trees as 
 well as holly and oak.                </content>
