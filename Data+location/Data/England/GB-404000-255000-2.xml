original Domesday Book.The present     
church,built in 1857-1858 is made of   
grey Lias limestone in 13th Century    
style.It also has a timbered porch and 
vestry.The church has three stained    
glass windows:

Very Reverend Allan Shaw takes the     
services every Sunday afternoon with an
average congregation of 15.The two     
church-wardens are Mr.Savage and
