		<title>02LOCAL HISTORY (SINCE 1840)</title>
		<content>{Chelford}is a village which has       
 moved. Up to the 1840's it was at the 
 junction A535/537.Early in the 1840's 
 a railway was planned passing to the  
 East of the village. Mr Dixon -a local
 landowner-opposed this and the railway
 took its present line with a station  
 as close as possible to the village.  
 The station area was given an inn -   
 Dixon Arms with coaches to Knutsford  
 and Macclesfield-and some cottages.   
 Since then,the village has moved its  
 centre westward with the station area 
 acquiring a cattle market,shops,bank, 
 further housing (private and council),
 government cold store(food), health   
 centre and a garage.This new area is  
 now considered to be Chelford,rather  
 than the original site which is the   
 home of only the Church,Post Office   
 and School.A new school is planned for
 this 'new'area in the 1990's.         </content>
