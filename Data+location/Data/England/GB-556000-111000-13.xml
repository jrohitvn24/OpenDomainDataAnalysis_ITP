		<content> The Neilson Nurseries at Hellingly    
 have been in existence for 51 years.  
 The 4.5 acres of greenhouses used to  
 produce tomatoes, but changed in l978 
 to potplants and now produce{1.5      
{million} each year. The Nursery       
 specialises in a limited variety of   
 beautiful plants, amongst which are { 
{POINSETTIAS}for Christmas time;       
{PRIMULA ACAULIS and MINIATURE ROSES}in
 the early spring;{IMPATIENS, HIBISCAS 
{and APHELANDERA}throughout the summer 
{.BEGONIAS and CHRYSANTHEMUMS}are grown
 all year round.                       
 Forty staff are employed to tend the  
 greenhouses, which are heated by a    
 coal burner which has recently been   
 installed. The plants are sold to     
{COVENT GARDEN MARKET }and Wholesalers 
 throughout Britain. They are delivered
 in temperature controlled lorries.
