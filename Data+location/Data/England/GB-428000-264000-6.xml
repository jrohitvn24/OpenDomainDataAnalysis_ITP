		<content> The Warwick area contains 5 first     
 schools for children of 5-8 years old.
 Westgate First School averages 160    
 children from a mixed background. A   
 survey was taken in a class of 35     
 children to establish a typical life  
 style. The children were in the 7-8   
 age group. we discovered that in this 
 class 25 of the children walked to    
 school, 9 came by car and 1 travelled 
 by public transport. 20 children lived
 in semi-detached houses, 7 in         
 terraced houses, 3 in maison-ettes, 3 
 in detached houses and 2 in flats. We 
 found that 16 children had            
 grand-parents living in Warwick, and  
 18 had grandparents living within 5   
 miles children owned many pets. 55%   
 of children had a cat, 50% fish, 48% a
 dog, 20% rabbit, 14% birds and        
 hamsters, 11% a guinea pig.
