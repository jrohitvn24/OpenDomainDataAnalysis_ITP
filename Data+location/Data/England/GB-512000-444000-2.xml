		<content>      Most people in{Sigglesthorne     
 work in jobs which are connected with 
{farming.}Some people travel from the  
 area to Hull, to Hornsea and to       
 Beverley to work.                     
      All the local jobs are on local  
 farms or at the gravel pits. A typical
 farm will employ one more man all the 
 year round and take on extra labour   
 or contractors at busy times. Twenty  
 drivers work from the gravel pits.    
      For all other forms of{employment
 people have to travel out of the      
 village. These jobs include a M.P.,   
 builders, joiners, shopkeepers,       
 doctor, garage mechanics, policemen,  
 hairdressers, optician.

 and two part time teachers. Five other
 part time jobs are provided by the    
 school.Some women have part time jobs 
 such as cleaning or shopwork.         </content>
