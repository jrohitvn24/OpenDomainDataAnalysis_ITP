		<title>08THE LOBSTER SMACK INN</title>
		<content>{                                      
  The oldest pub on Canvey is called   
 the Lobster Smack, and it's at the end
 of Haven Road, just by the sea wall.  
 There is a car park outside and there 
 are also tables and chairs where      
 people may sit. The roof is covered by
 tiles, and is a different shape to    
 normal pubs. The roof looks old,      
 because it isn't exactly symmetrical, 
 as modern roofs are. The walls on the 
 outside are covered by wooden         
 cladding, which makes the pub look    
 old. The ceilings are old, and you can
 see the beams made of wood. It's also 
 dark. The pub is there because it's   
 just near Hole Haven, which has very  
 deep water for big ships, so the      
 sailors would use the inn for enjoying
 themselves. There was also some       
 smuggling in this area.
