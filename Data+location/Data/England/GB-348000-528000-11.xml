		<title>11A day in the life of Ian</title>
		<content> In the morning at eight o'clock my    
 alrm goes off on my clock radio.  I   
 get dressed and go down stairs, I get 
 the milk off the doorstep and put it  
 in the fridge while I have my         
 breakfast of cofee and toast, I watch 
 BBC Breakfast television.  While I am 
 washing and cleaning my shoes, my mam 
 makes my sandwichs for my school      
 dinner.  Before I leave the house at  
 8.40 I check that I have my football, 
 library book and trainers in my bag.  
 On my way to school I call for my     
 friend Ian Wallace.  Once in school I 
 work until 10.15am at which time the  
 whole school goes into the hall for   
 assembly.  After assembly I have a    
 playtime, when I play football, tigy  
 or hounds and hares. At 10.45 I am    
 back in school and work until 12. when
 it is lunch time.  After lunch I go   
 out to play with my friends.          </content>
