 It goes from Wye to Ashford.In the    
 river stour there is pike and         
 trout.There is two fields both sides  
 of it.They are rough grazing and a    
 wheat field.There is some lilypads and
 weed in it.The weed looks like grass. 
 The creatures are cadis fly larvaes   
 and its eggs.There are leeches in the 
 weed.On one side of the river it goes 
 fast on the other it is slow.         
 At the sides there are some Alder     
 trees. Near Wye there are some sewage 
 works on the river stour. The river   
 Stour has many small streams running  
 into it.  The brook from our village  
 of Brook runs into it.
