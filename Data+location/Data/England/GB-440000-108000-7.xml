		<content>            Our area is south of the   
 docks on the other side of the River  
 Test.It is all{Reclaimed Land }       
 which has been made by pumping mud    
 dredged up from the bottom of         
 Southampton Water. We saw a well that 
 drained the water from the{waste land.
  There was an orange flag, warning    
 people not to trespass on this land.  
 There was a pipe that pumped the mud  
 on to the land but it was no longer   
 used. Across the river there were     
 boats docking in{Southampton Docks.   
   There was a ditch that had just been
 cleaned out but people were throwing  
 stones into it.                       
   From our survey area we could see a 
 building site where men were building 
 modern houses on a new estate.
