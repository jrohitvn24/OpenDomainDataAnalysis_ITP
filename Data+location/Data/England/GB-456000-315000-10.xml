		<title>10MEADOW FARM</title>
		<content> Mrs. Atkins has farmed Meadow Farm in 
 the Soar Valley for the last 9 years. 
 She has 36 acres of grassland which   
 floods sometimes. She keeps 13        
 Fresian/Hereford bullocks and 1       
 Charolet raised for beef at 2 years   
 old. She uses Leicester and Melton    
 Markets. She has 8 horses and one is  
 awaiting a foal. The farmhouse is 40  
 years old. Quorn By-Pass is scheduled 
 to cut through her land. She is       
 objecting to the plan. She will be    
 finished if that happens. She has 9   
 machines - tractors, a bailer, a mower
 and muck-spreader. She uses 1000 bales
 of hay each year to feed the animals.
