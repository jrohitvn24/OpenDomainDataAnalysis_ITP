		<title>11CYRIL J. DEAL OF KELVEDON</title>
		<content> Deal's garage opened in 1919 in those 
 days they only sold motorbikes.       
 Nowadays they only sell cars.Deal's   
 garage was built next to the station  
 so that the people going to London by 
 train could leave their cars to be    
 serviced and they can collect them    
 when they get back.Deal's garage has  
 a little camera outside which they use
 at night to keep guard on the cars.   
 Cars that are left outside have a     
 special wax put on them so the cars   
 don't go rusty.Before you take your   
 car on the road you must have a tax   
 disc. Deal's garage sells diesel and  
 petrol. Round the back of the garage  
 they have a machine so that when you  
 start your engine it will tell what is
 wrong with your car.
