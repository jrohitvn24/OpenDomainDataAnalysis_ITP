		<title>11WILDLIFE IN OUR AREA</title>
		<content>         Most of area is famland, it is
used for growing crops but you can     
still find areas with wildlife.        
         One of the areas is Wickham   
Skeith Grimmer, this is a large pond   
on the village green.                  
         At the Grimmer there are      
frogs,they mate there. There are toads,
they  also mate.Ducks breed in the     
reeds too. You can sometimes see the   
babies on the lilies running around.   
         There are some streams        
running through our area.Some of the   
children go dipping in them and we     
find some  tiny fish, water beetles,   
freshwater shrimps, water boatmen and  
many kinds of larvae.This shows that   
the water is clean.                    
         At Stoke Ash School we made   
bird boxes. There are some nesting in  
them at the moment.We also have an     
invertebrate area there.               </content>
