		<title>09Vandalism</title>
		<content> We have had a lot of vandalism in our 
 school.For instance our classroom has 
 been vandalised.The intruders got in  
 through the storeroom and threw paint 
 all over the place.They went up the   
 corridor as well and pulled all the   
 paintings down that class 1 had       
 done.They also emptied all class 3    
 children's books.Quite recently they  
 got in the staffroom and took all the 
 books out of the glass cabinet and    
 threw those around and left the taps  
 on which soaked the dressing-up       
 clothes.They also cut the telephone   
 cable.                                
   I think the people that do it must  
 be mad.They should clean up the mess  
 that they've made,if they are ever    
 caught.
