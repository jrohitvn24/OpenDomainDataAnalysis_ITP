		<title>04HOTHAM AND CAVE CONFLICT</title>
		<content>    During the Civil War between Oliver
 Cromwell and King James 1, there was  
 considerable disagreement between     
 villagers in North Cave and Hotham.   
 The people in Hotham supported        
 Cromwell whereas North Cave residents 
 favoured James l.   At this time      
 Cromwell's men visited North Cave     
 Church vandalising two alabaster      
 memorials by chopping off their hands 
 and feet and damaging their faces.    
 They remain near the altar steps.     
    Cromwell's men were coming so the  
 church silver was given to the        
 shepherd at Manor Farm for safety.  It
 is suspected to be hidden in a tunnel 
 connecting the church to the vicarage 
 but has never been found.  There is   
 evidence of a tunnel which runs deep  
 under Church Street.  What secret does
 it hold?                              
                                       </content>
