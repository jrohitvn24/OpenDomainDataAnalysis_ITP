		<content> The{trade}of salmon fishing is carried
 on here between the months of March   
 and August. Along the river there are 
 licensed, defined{fishing}areas which 
 are overseen by a Water Bailiff       
 (though it is understood that a       
 certain amount of poaching takes      
 place). Authorised{boats}work from    
 Halton Quay, and Hole's Hole, and near
 Hewton there are salmon gardens where 
 3ft wide channels are cut to enable   
 fishermen to work at high water.      
 Elsewhere, designated salmon pools are
 situated where mooring is not allowed 
 but nets may be set. In common with   
 most rivers, fishing as a{leisure}    
 occupation is popular, also the       
 catching of eels is a recent          
 development along this stretch of the 
 river.
