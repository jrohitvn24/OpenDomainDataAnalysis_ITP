		<title>14A Typical Family Day</title>
		<content> On a Thursday, on an ordinary working 
 day, each member of the Thomas family 
 does a different thing.  At about 7   
 a.m. we start getting up.  Then we    
 take it in turns to use the bathroom  
 and get dressed.  At about 7.30 a.m., 
 we all go downstairs to have          
 breakfast.  Mum prepares the breakfast
 for us.  Dad is usually the first to  
 finish and at 7.45 a.m. he goes to    
 work for British Telecom in           
 Wolverhampton.  Then at  8.15 a.m.,   
 Mum, Neil and I walk down to school.  
 Mum goes on to work at the Post       
 Office.  At 4 p.m., Neil and I reach  
 the Post Office, after leaving school 
 and at 4.30 p.m. we go shopping.  Dad 
 picks the family up at 5 p.m. and we  
 all have tea together as soon as we   
 get home.  At 5.45 p.m., we visit Nan 
 and stay for about an hour then I go  
 to Guides.  At 9 p.m. I return home.  </content>
