		<content>       Looking  from  the  A390 towards
 Plymouth, fields  are  laid  out  in a
 patchwork of  colours, browns, yellows
 and   predominant  greens, where sheep
 and cattle graze.  On a clear day  the
 bridges, linking  Devon  and Cornwall,
 carrying  cars  and  trains,  can   be
 clearly  seen.  Behind the bridges the
 huge  cranes   of   Plymouth  Dockyard
 tower  over the river. Beyond that, is
 Plymouth City with its blocks of flats
 spread out in front of Plymouth Sound.
 Away to   the  East,  Dartmoor  can be
 seen  with  its dark shadow spread out
 along the horizon. Small woods shelter
 scattered  villages and farms.  Wooded
 hedges snake over the hills.          
       By  night  the  twinkling lights
 of Plymouth are reflected in the river
 as  the  Eddystone  Light  flashes its
 warning  and  Dartmoor disappears into
 the shadows.                          </content>
