		<title>09REDBOURN HIGH STREET CONT</title>
		<content>  {Redbourn High Street}is constantly  
 changing.At present there are four    
 empty shops,all of which closed down  
 this year.One was a video hire shop,  
 another was a betting shop and a third
 was an antique shop.There are also    
 some areas of derelict land fronting  
 the High Street.                      
   Since the{By_pass}has been opened in
 November 1984,the{High Street}is not  
 so crowded and an effort has been made
 to bring back some of the old{        
{character}of the village by putting   
 old fashioned lamps in the street.
