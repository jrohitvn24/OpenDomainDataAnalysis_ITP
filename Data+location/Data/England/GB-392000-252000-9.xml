		<content> Churchill Mill has two mill races     
 below the building and two mill       
 wheels,one under and one over shot.   
 It dates back to the original Domesday
 book and the present building is 17th 
 century. The mill has not been used   
 regularly for grinding since 1920.    
 There is a weir above the mill.       
 Naunton Court was built in the        
 time of Queen Elizabeth 1st. with     
 black and white timbering on stone    
 foundations. In an upstairs hall the  
 court leet was held. There is a moated
 farm at Whiteladies Aston and there   
 are several other moats in the area.
