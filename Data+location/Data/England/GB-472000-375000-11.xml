		<title>11RELIGION IN HEADON</title>
		<content>  The Church in Headon was built in    
 1250. it is biult of some sort of     
 limestone which was probably quarried 
 in Lincolnshire. It has 1 bell (it    
 used to have 2, but one cracked). The 
 bell still works and it was cast in   
 Loughborough. The church does not have
 a choir and the vicar is also vicar of
 5 other churches. At an average       
 service there are 5 people who attend.
 There is one service a week. The usual
 collection goes to the church but at  
 Harvest Festivals it goes to the      
 Cheshire Home in East Retford. The    
 church itself has a crack in its tower
 and they need money which they find is
 hard to get. Headon gets a grant from 
 the Government but they find that this
 is not enough to mend the church. Some
 money has been raised from the well   
 dressing in the past 5 years. The     
 church has its own church hall.       </content>
