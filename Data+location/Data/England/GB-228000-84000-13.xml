		<title>13Thoughts About My Home</title>
		<content> My name is Bonny Shanks.I live at     
 Little Athill.I think I am very lucky 
 to live in this part of Launceston.It 
 has a very nice view and I get to see 
 lot of farm animals and how they get  
 fed.Also I get to see a lot of crops. 
 From the front of my house you can see
 lots of fields and woodland and from  
 the back of my house you can see      
 Mr.Lancaster's bungalow and           
 fields.Most of the time I leave the   
 rectangle for entertainment with my   
 friends etc.At home I play with my    
 brother and his friends and if it is  
 sunny we play cricket,football and    
 catch and if its raining we play The A
 Team,pillow fights or drawing.Although
 I like living where I do,it would be  
 nice to have some friends within      
 walking distance.
