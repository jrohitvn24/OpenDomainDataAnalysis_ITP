		<title>18The Workhouse At Ore</title>
		<content>         A workhouse was built in 1836 
 at Ore.This meant that the unsightly  
 and distressing poor houses could     
 disappear from Hastings and           
 St.Leonards which were fashionable    
 places in those days.The workhouse was
 built in what was then Cackle Sreet   
 and what is now Frederick  Road.Much  
 later an extension was built          
 on the other side of the road and     
 these eventually became part of       
 St.Helens Hospital.(This is a hospital
 without a casualty unit,dealing mainly
 with women and children's surgical    
 cases and geriatric care.)            
           In 1873 a report said that  
 the dining room in the workhouse was  
 very low and could be offensive.An    
 open sewer ran along the bottom of the
 workhouse garden and was a danger to  
 the inhabitants and to the residents  
 in the neighbourhood.                 </content>
