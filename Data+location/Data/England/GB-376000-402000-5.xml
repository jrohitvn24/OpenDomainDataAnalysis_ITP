		<title>05Home life in Pendlebury</title>
		<content>     Our house is on{Bolton Road}which 
 is the main road through{Pendlebury.  
 My mum and dad are buying the house   
 but my dad says it will take twenty   
 years to pay for it. It cost Â£17250   
 when we bought it three years ago. It 
 has three bedrooms. Mine is painted   
{red and white}because I support       
{Manchester United}football team and   
 those are their colours. We have a big
 garden where my brother and I have to 
 play because we are not allowed to    
 play out on Bolton Road when there are
 hundreds of{cars and lorries}going by.
 If I go to the grocers shop on the    
 other side of the road I have to walk 
 along and use the Pelican crossing.   
 Sometimes I go and play with my friend
 who lives near{Agecroft Colliery.}He  
 lives in a colliery house and his dad 
 is a{miner.}
