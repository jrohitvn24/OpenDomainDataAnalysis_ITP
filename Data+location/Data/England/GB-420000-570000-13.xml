 chose{BRUNSWICK VILLAGE}and its       
 surrounding area.Brunswick Village is 
 situated about six miles north of     
{Newcastle city centre.}the area our   
 group covered was about eight square  
 miles.The subject allocated was       
 Industry and Commerce.For our study we
 looked at Brunswick Industrial        
 estate,Brunswick village,Wideopen and 
 other surrounding industries and      
 shops.                                
       Our group from{Blakelaw School  
 sixth form looked at the various      
 aspects of{Industry and Commerce}     
 around the area.                      
       We collected our information on 
 survey sheets designed on the computer
 and by asking the public in the area  
 about Industry and Commerce.          
 Observation also played an important  
 part of the survey.                   </content>
