		<title>19A Life in Peterborough</title>
		<content>  Infancy in Peterborough in 1940 meant
 responses to blackouts, sirens and    
 rationing but little else. The war    
 by-passed it. Childhood saw gradual   
 change and a sense of normality and   
 hope. Estates were built, the town    
 thrived. Weekly visits to the bustling
 market with a cathedral backcloth were
 exciting and satisfying. Departmental 
 stores with whizzing tubes; haber-    
 dashers, ironmongers (words almost    
 forgotten) or the village store with  
 its smells of coffee, cheese and      
 soap meant goods were plentiful again.
 Young adulthood saw a bright future,  
 with new opportunities. Then the      
 concept of the new town was born ...  
 but the old town seemed to die. The   
 Development Corporation took over and 
 the city lost its heart as landmarks  
 were demolished, But, rising like a   
 phoenix has emerged a proud new city. </content>
