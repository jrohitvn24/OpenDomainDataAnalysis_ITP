		<title>09WILDLIFE AT ABBERTON</title>
		<content> Abberton is the major reservoir in    
 Britain for resting and overwintering 
 wildfowl on their migrations to and   
 from breeding grounds in N.W.Europe   
 and in Asia.To protect the unique bird
 population the area has been          
 designated a Wetland of International 
 Importance under the terms of the     
 Ramsar Convention. The Essex Water    
 Company has hosted a wildfowl ringing 
 station since 1949. Many rings        
 returned from abroad. Some are        
 outstanding, such as a tufted duck on 
 the N.W.frontier of India or a pintail
 in Senegal, W.Africa.                 
{FISHING}                              
 Although bank fishing space is limited
 due to the steep slopes of the        
 reservoir, Abberton is a noted coarse 
 fishery, famous for its large pike,   
 bream and eels. Day tickets are       
 available.                            </content>
