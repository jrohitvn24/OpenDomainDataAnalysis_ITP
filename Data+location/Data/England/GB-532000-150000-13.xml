		<title>13Recreation in Blechingley.</title>
		<content> B.A.D.S. stands for Blechingley       
 Amateur Dramatic Society. They are a  
 group of people from the Tandridge and
 Redhill areas who produce a pantomime 
 annually and sometimes a small play   
 during the year.One such play         
 was,"Blythe Spirit," by Noel Coward.  
 It was about a man haunted by the     
 ghost of his first wife ending with   
 the death of his second wife and his  
 subsequent haunting by both wives. The
 scenery and effects were brilliant.   
    In 1984, August brought a disaster 
 when their rehearsal hut was gutted.  
 Building new scenery and rehearsing in
 the remainder hut, they somehow       
 produced a pantomime that Christmas.
