     St. Luke's Church was built in the
18th century.  It is made of limestone 
and has got stained glass windows      
throughout.  The church is surrounded  
almost completely by the grave yard    
which contains 172 graves, 142 of which
have headstones, some dating back to   
the 18th century.                      
     The services at the church are    
held every Sunday at 10 o'clock and the
church bell rings before the service.  
The church will seat about 204 people  
but only 22 members regularly attend.  
The congregation is made up mostly     
of local people.  St. Luke's does not  
have a choir.   There are two church   
wardens who help the vicar.  A parish  
magasine comes out every month.        
    In 1984 there was one marriage,    
three baptisms and one funeral.
