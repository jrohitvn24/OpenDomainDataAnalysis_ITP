		<content>{ Pets are animals that we enjoy       
{keeping.} There are many reasons why  
 we keep pets.  Pets like cats and dogs
 can keep us company.  Some people say 
 that it is good for us to keep pets   
 because stroking them can keep us     
 calm.  Although keeping pets can mean 
 a lot of work for us, we enjoy looking
 after them.  We keep some colourful or
 unusual pets, such as fish, just to   
 look at.{
