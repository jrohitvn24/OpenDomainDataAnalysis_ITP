		<content> Originally there were 3 schools in    
Burscough which had pupils from infants
to senior.They were all built in       
approx. 1850.                          
 In 1958 Priory High Secondary School  
was built to take  the senior pupils,  
from eleven years old, from all        
the primary schools in Burscough and   
the surrounding areas (approx. 15      
schools).  The children passing their  
eleven-plus scholarship went to        
Grammar School usually in Ormskirk.    
 In 1978 Priory High became a          
Comprehensive School taking pupils of  
all abilities.                         
 There is a need for Nursery Education 
provision in the area. A committee has 
been formed to promote the scheme.     
 Lordsgate Township Primary School was 
rebuilt at the end of the 2nd.World War
to replace the original building demol-
ished to provide an air-field.         </content>
