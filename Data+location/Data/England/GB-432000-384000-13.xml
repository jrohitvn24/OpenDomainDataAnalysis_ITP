		<content> In our area there are two hospitals,  
 Nether Edge and The Royal Hallamshire.
 Nether Edge was once a workhouse. It  
 has four specialities: a Maternity    
 unit, an Antenatal clinic, a Stroke   
 unit and a Rheumatism clinic. There   
 are two wards for the younger         
 disabled. The average age is below 60.
  The Royal Hallamshire, planned in    
 1940, was opened in 1978. Since then, 
 0.25 million people have been treated.
 There are 728 beds with 87 spare for  
 emergencies.                          
  In the operating theatre the surgeons
 have spent 0.25 million pounds on     
 instruments. They have to wash hands  
 for 10 minutes before operations.
