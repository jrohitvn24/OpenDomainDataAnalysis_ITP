		<title>12EMMA'S DAY IN HAXEY</title>
		<content> my foot angrily and squashed an       
 ant."Breakfast time!"yelled Bruce.I   
 tried to jump the heather,missed and  
 fell in the garden."I'm               
 telling!"crowed Bruce."Tell-tale      
 tit!"I began."That's enough Emma!"mum 
 growled.                              
    For breakfast,I had a glass of Um  
 Bongo juice,chocolate flavoured       
 porridge,(loads of syrup on too!)a    
 cracker with chocolate spread on      
 it,and a cup of tea."I don't want your
 Freedom!"the radio blared."Wham!Ace!"I
 cried.I danced around the kitchen in  
 time to the music and fell over Bruce 
 who was sunbathing on the floor,well  
 it looked like that anyway.           
     Later on,I decided to write to    
 Victoria my friend."What's the        
 date,mum?"I asked."The eleventh",she  
 replied."Thanks".(I can never be      
 bothered to look at the calendar.)    </content>
