		<title>17A DAY IN THE LIFE OF NICOLA</title>
		<content> It's 06.45 when I get up. I don't get 
 up by myself, my brother always pulls 
 my hair. My mum gets my porridge      
 ready. Then I watch Popeye on T.V. At 
 07.30 I get dressed, get my things    
 ready for school, then read a book    
 until 08.20. By this time my mum has  
 gone to work.I set off for school and 
 I meet Lucy. When we are in the       
 classroom we read and our class       
 teacher Mr. Margretts calls the       
 register. We then go into assembly.   
 Mr. Bullock our headmaster reads a    
 story then we sing a hymn and say a   
 prayer. When we get back into our     
 classrooms we have English. At 10.35  
 we have break. After break we have    
 maths. At 12.00 we have lunch break.  
 We have our lunch at 12.20. When I    
 have finished my lunch I go back out  
 to play with Lucy and we play on the  
 field.At 13.00 we have to go inside.  </content>
