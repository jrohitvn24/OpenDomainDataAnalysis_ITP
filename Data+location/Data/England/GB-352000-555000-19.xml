		<content>     The lack of public transport      
 affects CASTLE CARROCK as it does     
 other rural areas, and especially as  
 many of the inhabitants are elderly.  
 This means they are less capable of   
 using their own transport and have a  
 greater need for services which are   
 not found within the village.         
     There are only 5 buses a day to   
 Carlisle on weekdays (the last one    
 from Carlisle is 17.45, limiting      
 evening entertainment), 2 on Saturdays
 and one on Sundays.   Only 2 buses a  
 day link the nearest town of Brampton,
 with none at weekends.                
      The original nearest railway     
 station closed many years ago leaving 
 Brampton Junction (4 miles, no bus) as
 the nearest one.   There are 9 trains 
 a weekday between Carlisle and        
 Newcastle, most of which stop at      
 Brampton Junction.                    </content>
