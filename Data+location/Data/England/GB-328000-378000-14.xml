		<title>14HOUSE TYPES IN NESTON AREA</title>
		<content>    In{Parkgate}we have private        
 detached and semi-detached houses and 
 bungalows. Many roads are tree-lined. 
    In{Neston}there are some more      
 private houses of this type and some  
 older terraced housing, some of it in 
 the local sandstone. There are also   
 very many council houses, in terraces 
 or semi-detached. Gardens are smaller 
 and there are less trees.             
    In{Thornton Hough}there are two    
 areas. The main village was planned as
 a unit by the first{Lord Leverhulme}  
 and is a pleasant combination of      
 styles and materials, using           
 traditional Cheshire black &amp; white    
 designs as a start, and having a Dutch
 influence. There is also a modern     
 private housing development.          
    In{Gayton}the housing is all       
 private, much of it being detached.
