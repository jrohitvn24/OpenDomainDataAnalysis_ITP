		<title>13BEAUMONT SHOPPING COMPLEX</title>
		<content> The rapidly expanding population      
 (estimated to be 29,000 by 1993) made 
 the provision of a large shopping     
 centre imperative. 250,000 sq ft of   
 development has been built up as a    
 self contained village consisting     
 of : 41 shops, 7 lock-up shops, 19    
 flats, a covered market, a superstore 
 and free car-parking for 1260 cars.   
 The centre has been designed to blend 
 in with the landscape giving the feel 
 of streets rather than a formal       
 precinct. Completed in May 1984, it is
 situated 3 miles to the NW of the city
 centre with links to the A6, A50, M1  
 and M69. It is a pedestrianised       
 precinct, the focal point of which is 
 a covered market. The main superstore,
 Tesco, has 44 checkouts, covers 58,000
 sq ft and is used by 38,000 people a  
 week. It is the biggest Tesco in the  
 country and even provides free buses. </content>
