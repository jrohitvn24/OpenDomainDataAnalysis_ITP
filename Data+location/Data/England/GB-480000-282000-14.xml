 The fruits are strawberries,rasberry, 
 blackcurrents,gooseberries and        
 blackberries.                         
 When the farm first opened there were 
 only 12-14 cows which was enough to   
 keep the family going with food.      
{Desborough Motors}started in          
 1936.Since then the A6 has turned     
 into a major road and buiness has     
 become better.However this has created
 more pollution because of the         
 increased volume of cars on the A6.   
 These give off petrol fames,          
 containing lead and perhaps fruit     
 growers will suffer from this.Most of 
 the public now own cars and use the   
 garage.                               
 The garage is not popular with        
 all people as it sometimes gives out  
 petrol fumes.
