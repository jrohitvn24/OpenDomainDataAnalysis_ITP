		<content> Walberswick a unique village on the   
 Suffolk coast, bounded on its northern
 side with heathland, grazing marshes  
 and the harbour of the 'Blyte', with  
 its Longmore fishing boats and        
 pleasure craft.  To the south of the  
 village a great many acres of saltings
 growing reeds for thatching, and      
 supporting many rare species of birds,
 to east is the north sea encroaching  
 on the saltings at every scouring tide
 which pushes the sand and shingle bank
 slowly inland.  The area abounds with 
 footpaths to delight the walker, with 
 fine views of heath, marsh and sea.   
 Many houses have been brought to the  
 village from elsewhere and rebuilt,   
 also conversions from coach houses and
 garages along with standard houses    
 giving a variety of architecture. Half
 the 250 houses in the village are used
 as holiday homes.                     </content>
