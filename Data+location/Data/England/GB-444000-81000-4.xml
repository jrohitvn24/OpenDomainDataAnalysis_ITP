		<content> There are 4 manor houses around the   
 village of Shorwell. The oldest,      
 Kingston Manor, is an original 13th   
 century stone building, remodelled in 
 the 17th century. The present family, 
 the Mews, have lived in the house for 
 the last 350 years. 2 of the other    
 manor houses, West Court and          
 Wolverton, were built of local stone  
 in the 16th century. The remaining    
 manor house, by far the largest, North
 Court, was built in the early 17th    
 century.                              
 The only 2 other substantial buildings
 are Limerstone farmhouse and Yafford  
 Mill.
