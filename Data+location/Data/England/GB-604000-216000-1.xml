 The area covers the estuary of        
 the River Colne,and the neighbouring  
 countryside.                          
 The estuary is used by yachtsmen and  
 trading vessels on their way to the   
 Hythe at Colchester.It also includes  
 the Pyefleet Channel,famous for its   
 oyster beds since Roman times.        
 The west bank comprises the Langenhoe 
 marshes and the Geedon marshes at     
 Fingringhoe.Partly M.O.D.land,these   
 marshes are important nature reserves.
 The east bank at Brightlingsea is     
 formed from marsh-land and high areas 
 of glacial gravels.Gravel extraction  
 and farming are the main occupations  
 though other points of interest are   
 the fine church and a toy factory.    
 Brightlingsea attracts tourists.
