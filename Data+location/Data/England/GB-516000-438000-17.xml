   There has been a parish church in   
 Withernwick since at least the        
 beginning of the 12th century. In 1855
 the rebuilding of the church was      
 completed at a cost of Â£1,305.        
   The Methodist(Wesleyan)Chapel was   
 built in 1810 and the present building
 is the one that was rebuilt in 1914.  
 The Methodist Sunday School was built 
 in 1845 and is still in use.          
   The school in Withernwick is another
 old building part of which was        
 built  in 1846, but even before that  
 date it is known that a Free School   
 existed for 17 poor children. This    
 school was supported by the Lord of   
 the Manor,R.Bethell Esq.
