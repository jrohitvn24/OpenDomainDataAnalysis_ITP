		<title>02KINGSCLERE'S CHURCHES</title>
		<content>  In Kingsclere there are three        
 churches.{St. Mary's (C. of E.)}dates 
 from Norman times.It is built of flint
 and stone,and has a square tower with 
 a peal of eight bells which are rung  
 before services. There is a choir, and
 a Sunday-school meets during the      
 morning service. Kneelers were made by
 local people, and show the badges of  
 many local clubs. A stained-glass     
 window in memory of the trainer,      
 William Hastings-Bass, shows          
 racehorses on the downs, and another  
 window associated with a previous     
 trainer, John Porter, also has a      
 picture of a horse.                   
  The tower has a weather-vane which   
 represents a bed-bug. King John is    
 said to have stayed in the village inn
 and been bitten by bed-bugs -         
 according to legend.
