		<title>09E GRINSTEAD LOCAL CONCERNS</title>
		<content> There is some frustration over the    
 rail service to London and lack of    
 connections to the coast and the      
 Gatwick area by train. While people   
 wish to have access they want to      
 retain the market town atmosphere and 
 not to fuse into Crawley or become    
 linked to a suburban sprawl. Parking  
 space in the town is generally        
 insuffucient and expensive and too    
 little provision is made for office   
 workers to park all day. Some concern 
 is voiced over the spread of Gatwick  
 airport, aircraft noise following any 
 expansion and the lack of a bypass.   
 Preservation of the towns character   
 and old buildings is regarded as      
 paramount, hence the watchdog east    
 Grinstead Society. It is feared that  
 the traffic explosion, both aerial &amp;  
 motor will destroy the qualities the  
 area now represents.                  </content>
