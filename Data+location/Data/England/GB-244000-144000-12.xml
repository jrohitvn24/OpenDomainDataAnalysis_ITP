		<content>     The church of St Sabinus, as might
 be expected in a village of modern    
 origin, was built in the early part of
 this century.  The land was donated by
 Miss Chichester, who suggested the    
 name St Sabinus, an Italian Bishop    
 reputed to have sailed here from      
 Ireland to convert the heathens.  In  
 fact the church was not completed     
 until the 1960s.  It is a large church
 for the size of the village, but in   
 the summer the congregation is swelled
 with holidaymakers.                   
     The church became part of the     
 Ilfracombe Team Ministry in 1977.  The
 Electoral Roll is 65 and average      
 attendance is 60.  Sunday services are
 8am Holy Communion and 10am Sung      
 Eucharist.
