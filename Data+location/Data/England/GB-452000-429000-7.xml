 make the diversion because they were  
 afraid that there would be a          
 subsidence on the old railway because 
 of the Selby coalfield.The length of  
 it is 14 miles(23.5 km).It is used for
 coal trains and inter city 125's that 
 travel from London to Aberdeen.The    
 line was started on the 29th July     
 1980.It was built by A.Monks &amp; Co     
 Ltd.It was opened on the 3rd October  
 1983.The people who were there were   
 the chairman of B.R,the chairman of   
 the N.C.B,the chairman of the C.E.G.B 
 and the Boss of Monks.Under the       
 railway is 40 million tons of coal    
 which cannot be mined.The railway cost
