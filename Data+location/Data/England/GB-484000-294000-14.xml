		<content> The Eyebrook reservoir is an          
 attractive habitat for a wide variety 
 of bird life. Although small in       
 comparison with Rutland Water, much of
 it is relatively undisturbed,save by  
 fishermen,particularly at the northern
 end where the largest flocks of       
 wildfowl usually congregate.Resident  
 species include{moorhen,coot,tufted   
{duck,great crested grebe,mallard,teal,
{and canada geese}The surrounding      
 fields. hedges and woods are home for 
 many{finches,buntings,sparrows,larks, 
{pigeon thrushes,titmice,wrens and     
{dunnocks.}Gulls are always present on 
 the water, often in very large flocks.
 Black{headed gulls and lesser black   
{backs}are the most common feeding on  
 the nearby fields by day.{Waders      
{include  redshank}and{snipe;lapwings  
 are always abundant.
