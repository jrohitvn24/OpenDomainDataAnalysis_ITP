{ market.}The stallholders sell all    
 sorts of things and they are much     
 cheaper than the shops.{Market days}  
 are{Friday and Saturday.}             
  Near the market is the{town centre-} 
 the{shopping precinct.}Here there are 
 lots of{shops}and all the{big stores.}
 It is very{busy at weekends}but you   
 can buy almost anything. Soon it will 
 be even bigger and better because a   
 Sainsbury's and an Asda are being     
 built.                                
  People from all over the area come to
 shop in{Stockport}because{the shops   
{ are so good.}It has plenty of car    
 parks and if you have not got a car   
 the bus and railway stations are only 
 two minutes walk away.
