		<content> The ecology of the village is dictated
 largely by the farming community, the 
 soil being a medium loam it is heavily
 cultivated. Hedges have vanished at an
 alarming rate and large fields are    
 commonplace. Large flocks of Peewits  
 and Golden Plover search the open     
 fields and there is a large Rookery in
 the grounds of the "Old Hall". Pigeons
 Pheasants and French Partridges abound
 and provide good shooting "sport".    
 Skylarks are common, several pairs of 
 Kestrel inhabit the area and Little,  
 Tawny and Barn Owls are often spotted.
 Common in gardens are house sparrows, 
 Starlings,Dunnocks,Robins,and Chaf,   
 Bull,Green and Gold finches, Blue and 
 Great Tits, Wrens, Blackbirds and     
 Thrushes. In winter large flocks of   
 Duck and Gulls arrive, Fieldfares and 
 Redwings migrate in. In summer Martins
 Swallows and Swifts live in the area. </content>
