 called{Cerizay}in{1985}.This was

 Committee.                            
  Cerizay was chosen because the       
 Councils liked each other and the     
 towns were of similar size.           
  It was decided to hold the first     
 twinning ceremony in the context of

 Cerizay came to Ongar in May,1985.
