		<content>      The raw wool is cleaned and spun 
 before it is made into cloth.It is    
 sent to{Sowerby Bridge}to be dyed     
 and is returned the same day to be    
 finished.The cloth is of a high       
 quality because the water used to wash
 it comes from Black Brook and is very 
 soft.                                 
      Nearly all college and university
 scarves are made from the material    
 made at Bury Mill.                    
{Norcliffes Mill}                      
      Norcliffes Mill is in the  same  
 valley as Bury Mill and uses the same 
 water supply.They make material for   
 car seats and caravan seats.          
       They use an assortment of       
 yarns.Some comes from Italy but the   
 rest is local yarn.The wool is cleaned
 and dyed before it is spun.It is then 
 woven with the imported yarns into a  
 stripey upholstery fabric.            </content>
