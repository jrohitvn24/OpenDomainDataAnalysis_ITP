		<title>09GARDEN CENTRES IN THE AREA.</title>
		<content> There are two garden centres in the   
 area. One in Temple Normanton owned Mr
 Handbury is really a nursery. It deals
 mainly with the 'trade' supplying     
 garden centres, shops and the local   
 councils with plants.                 
                                       
 The other, in Winsick, is owned by the
 Van Gemeren brothers and has been open
 to the public since 1952. It covers   
 an area of ten acres and includes     
 shops, greenhouses and an outdoor area
 where sectional buildings are on      
 display.                              
                                       
 In addition to the two brothers who   
 still work as gardeners, two full time
 and four part time workers are        
 employed. Roses and bulbs are a       
 speciality of the centre but a variety
 of other plants are available.
