		<title>13Palmeira Avenue</title>
		<content> The Avenue is very long and made up of
 two separate sections. On the lower   
 section there are mainly very large   
 houses which are divided into flats   
 and bedsitters. There is also an hotel
 and solicitors' and accountants'      
 offices. There are small gardens and  
 some garages.                         
 The upper half of the avenue contains 
 two purpose built blocks of flats and 
 again many large houses which have not
 been converted. One large house is a  
 special school for the handicapped.   
 Most people are professionals, that is
 doctors, solicitors, nurses and       
 teachers. There are a large number of 
 retired people.                       
 On Sundays the Avenue is very quiet.  
 Almost all the people I spoke to      
 except the retired, sleep late on     
 Sunday morning.
