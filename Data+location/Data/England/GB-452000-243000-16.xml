		<title>16Family eating habits</title>
		<content>Most people we spoke to began their day
with breakfast at about 8.00am.It      
consisted of cereal,with milk and      
sugar,a slice of bread or toast with   
butter and jam or marmalade.They drank 
tea,coffee,milk or fruit juice.There   
were just a few who had a cooked meal  
of bacon and eggs.                     
At lunch time it has become normal for 
people to eat a snack lunch of soup,   
sandwiches,crisps,fruit and perhaps a  
cake or biscuit.                       
The main meal of the day is a cooked   
supper when all the family have        
returned home from work.Meat or fish is
eaten with vegetables and potatoes     
followed by a sweet course.If the      
father worked from home (farmer) then  
these two meals were sometimes         
reversed.On  Sundays however most      
families gathered together for a cooked
meal at lunch-time.                    </content>
