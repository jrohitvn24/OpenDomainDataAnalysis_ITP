		<title>12SIMISTER QUAIL FARM.</title>
		<content>  The block is unusual in that it      
 contains one of the few Quail farms in
 the country on the outskirts of       
 Simister village in the east of the   
 block.                                
 The farm was set up due to village    
 opposition to the building of a       
 housing estate on land. The land was  
 sold in 1981 to Mr and Mrs Husain on  
 the condition that the land was       
 farmed. They have now established a   
 Quail farm and maintain some 30,000   
 birds, supplying restaurants all over 
 the country with fresh and frozen     
 Quail.
