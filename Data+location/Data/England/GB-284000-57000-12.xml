		<title>12INTERVIEW MRS.CAME</title>
		<content> Rachel and Emma interviewed Mrs.Came  
 who has lived in the area for many    
 years.About 70 years ago she said that
 roads were much narrower and had no   
 pavements.There were fewer houses,most
 of them being small cottages.Most of  
 the work on the farm,where she        
 lives,was done by machine.There were  
 fewer shops and the local post office 
 only sold sweets,now it sells         
 groceries and plants.The shops were   
 not of self service type and there    
 were no supermarkets.                 
 The ladies wore long straight dresses,
 hats,gloves and silk stockings.       
 The local school had only one room and
 there were not so many children.      
 Not so many buses were running and so 
 you either walked or travelled by     
 horse and trap.                       
       By Rachel and Emma.
