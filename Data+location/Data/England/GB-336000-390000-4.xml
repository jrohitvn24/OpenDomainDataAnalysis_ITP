		<content>  All schools in this area repoted an  
 increase in employment amongst parents
 and older brothers and sisters. Old   
 Swan Job Centre gave the following    
 figures to the children of Broadgreen 
 Jnrs:                                 
  23% of the work force are unemployed.
  62% of school leavers go into paid   
 work,much of this is in YTS. They also
 said that despite the Wavertree       
 Science Park future prospects are not 
 good.                                 
  St. Sebastians School found that 29% 
 of their fathers were unemployed and  
 53% of mothers work full or part time.
 This was perhaps due to male          
 employment and low wage levels.       
  Birchfield School found that 34% of  
 fathers are unemployed. Of those      
 employed lorry drivers and building   
 trade workers were most numerous.
