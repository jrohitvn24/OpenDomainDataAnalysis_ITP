		<title>11The Blacksmith of Laxton</title>
		<content>                                       
 The blacksmith in Laxton is called    
 Herbert Martin.The shop he works in is
 over one hundred years old and the    
 blacksmith has worked in the shop for 
 forty one years now.He said that he   
 works all hours when needed.When we   
 went to see the blacksmith he was     
 making some gates for a man who is a  
 policeman.At the blacksmiths there was
 an anvil and we saw him heating some  
 metal then bending it on the anvil.He 
  used this metal for the gates he was 
 making.The policeman who he was making
 the gates for,lives across the road   
 from school.In the blacksmiths we also
 saw a power hammer which was just like
 a big hammer.We also saw a vice which 
 is to hold things still while the     
 blacksmith works on them.The inside of
 the shop was like a junk shop but the 
 blacksmith knew where things were.    </content>
