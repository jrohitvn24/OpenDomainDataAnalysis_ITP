		<content>  About five sixths of this part of    
 Morecambe Bay is covered by sea at    
 some time of the year.About half is   
 covered by neap tides, the rest by    
 spring tides.This latter is covered   
 with good quality turf which is cut   
 and sold to gardeners. Sheep graze at 
 low tides keeping the grass short.    
  The marshlands continually change.   
 Each high tide, especially when backed
 with a strong wind, causes more grass 
 to be lost. The drainage channel from 
 Leighton Moss has been improved       
 recently to help lessen the effect of 
 the erosion, but unfortunately the    
 grassland is disappearing very        
 rapidly.                              
  Although many areas of quicksand are 
 to be found, the Cross Bay Walk       
 sometimes passes through the area as  
 did the old Morecambe - Grange route.
