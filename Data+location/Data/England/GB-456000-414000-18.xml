 gentleman in his 70's. He has lived   
 there all his life. He worked on his  
 father's farm when he was young. He   
 remembers working with{traction       
{engines}and has always had a love for 
 them. He now finds old engines and    
{rebuilds}them, making the parts       
 himself. He has one traction engine   
 that he takes to shows all over the   
 country. He can travel at 4 m.p.h. The
 traction engine has a{tender}to carry 
 the coal and water. He is rebulding   
 an engine at the moment that was built
 in 1889. He found it in a dyke on the 
 farm his father used to work. He      
 remembers working with this machine   
 when he was a small boy.
