		<title>09LINHOPE VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Linhope is located in a deep valley on
 the Linhope burn. It can only be      
 reached by using the private road from
 Hartside.This hamlet is dominated by a
 large country-house.Until recently the
 house was owned by a single family but
 now, after the death of the owner the 
 house is now run as an old-folks      
 home. The other houses in the hamlet  
 are inhabited by either workers of the
 home or by the farm-workers.The hamlet
 is surrounded by trees (mostly        
 conifers), and is a popular place for 
 trippers to the area to walk to (cars 
 are left at Hartside). In winter the  
 place can be almost cut-off by snow   
 for days on end and the steepness of  
 the surrounding hills limits the      
 amount of sun. In summer the hamlet   
 can be a sun-trap and very much hotter
 than surrounding areas.
