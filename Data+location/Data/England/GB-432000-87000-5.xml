{ A day in my life by Louise age 7     
 I get up and put on a flowery  skirt, 
 a checked blouse and jumper  and my   
 shoes then I have my breakfast. I     
 get ready to catch the bus.I pick     
 up my satchel and coat. Then Dad takes
 us to the bus. When we get to school  
 we have a play then I go inside. Mrs  
 Sharp does the register _ 17 people   
 are here today. We do our maths then  
 we have prayers. In prayers we had a  
 story and a song and said a prayer. We
 go out to play then we do some        
 copy_writing. We sing with Mrs Clark. 
 After we had finished we went to      
 lunch.After lunch we went to play.    
 When we came in we played rounders.   
 After rounders we went out to play    
 then we had a story and we went home.
