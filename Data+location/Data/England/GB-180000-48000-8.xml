		<title>08MODERN DAIRYFARMING,ST.ALLEN</title>
		<content> Boswellick is a 180acre dairy &amp; arable
 farm owned &amp; occupied by Mr.&amp; Mrs.    
 Carveth with 3 daughters;with 2 full- 
 time workers from Truro &amp; Allet.Dairy-
 farming was encouraged in 1978,&amp;modern
 cattle accommodation was built.Milk   
 quotas have now forced a cut-back in  
 herd size.60 Friesian cows are milked 
 in a herringbone parlour,with 5 being 
 milked &amp; 5 washed down at a time.From 
 October or November,depending on      
 weather,to April when grass is growing
 cattle are in a cubicle-house with    
 computerised feeding;each cow wears an
 electronic collar device &amp; receives a 
 controlled quota daily,divided into   
 hourly amounts,with correct nutrients 
 for each cow's requirements based on  
 lactation stage.Calves are similarly  
 fed from a milk machine.Cows also have
 access to self-feed silage. Heifer    
 calves are kept as dairy-followers.   </content>
