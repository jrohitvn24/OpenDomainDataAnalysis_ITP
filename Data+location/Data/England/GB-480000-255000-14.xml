		<title>14 LACE-MAKING IN DENTON</title>
		<content>Lace-making was once a widespread      
cottage industry &amp; at one time men made
lace because they could earn more      
than they could working in the fields. 
Lace schools were set up in many       
villages and about a century ago a     
lace school was held in a cottage in   
Bedford Road Denton where children of 6
&amp; 7 were taught Bedfordshire-Maltese   
lace.                                  
It is not now possible to earn a living
from lace-making but it is gaining     
popularity as a hobby. Three ladies    
from the village travel weekly to      
classes in Northampton.                
In July 1985 a lace-maker from Strixton
came to speak to the children at Denton
School. They  were fascinated by it and
enjoyed learning Whole Stitch on a     
demonstation pillow.                   
Perhaps some will be inspired to join  
the many present day lacemakers.       </content>
