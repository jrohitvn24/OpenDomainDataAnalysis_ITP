		<title>03THE VICAR OF ST. MARK'S.</title>
		<content>{ The Reverend Trevor Park B.A., S.Th. 
 is the present vicar of this parish.  
 He came on the 26th October 1984. He  
 was invited by the patron of Kendal to
 be the vicar here. His first reaction 
 was one of feeling very welcome. In   
 January of this year Mr. Park began a 
{Young Christians group}by sending     
 letters to young people who had       
 recently been confirmed, inviting them
 to{the Vicarage}to meet as a group.   
 Reverend Park joins in with their     
 activities.                           
  In addition to learning more about   
 God, the{Young Christians}enjoy       
 playing outdoor sports and going on   
 trips. Mr. Park thinks it is important
 for young Christians to meet together 
 for a variety of activities.
