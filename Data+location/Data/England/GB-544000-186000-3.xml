		<content> The High Road, which bisects the area,
 closely follows the route of the old  
{Roman road}which linked London to     
 Colchester. During the 18th and early 
 19th century, it became an important  
 mail and stage coach route.           
 In 1839, the{Eastern Counties Railway 
 extended their line from London       
 through the area. In 1862, this became
 part of the{Great Eastern Railway}and 
 at the end of the last century,       
 stations were built to serve the new  
 housing estates at Seven Kings,       
 Goodmayes and Chadwell Heath.         
 The Central Line of the London        
{Underground system}reaches Newbury    
 Park and the area is well served by   
 a dense network of London Transport   
{bus}services. Despite all this, car   
 usage is increasing rapidly and       
 traffic congestion is a major problem 
 in the area.      MAYFIELD HIGH SCHOOL</content>
