		<content>{Charities. }The Caring and Sharing    
 shop supports 25 different charities. 
 Approximately 20 people work there.   
 They get writing paper,books and lots 
 of other gifts sent in to sell for    
 charities like Lifeboat and Save the  
 Children Fund.                        
{Volunteers.}The workers do not get    
 paid but work in their free time. Most
 are retired people who enjoy helping. 
 There are 2 men and the rest are      
 women.Some of the  staff have been    
 working there at least 3 years.Some of
 the workers go in for 1 or 2 hours a  
 week.Mr.Lubbock,the owner,had asked   
 them if they would work in the shop   
 unpaid                                
{Customers.}In the summer there is more
 business than winter.They don't get   
 many customers but they get a lot of  
 things sent.
