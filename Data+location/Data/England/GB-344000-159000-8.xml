		<content>{Children at School play games at      
 playtime :Danish Rounders,English     
 Rounders,Softball Cricket,Catch,Tennis
 Football,Netball,Handstands. Some     
 chant Riddles or Rhymes like          
 this: "Crocodile,Crocodile, May we    
 cross the water, To see your lovely   
 daughter, Dressed in blue?" The person
 who is'it'has to call colours.        
 Children wearing it get across.If     
 they aren't they get chased and are   
 'it'.We conducted a survey to see     
 which was the most popular game and   
 this was Softball Cricket. Then we    
 asked the seventh girl and boy on the 
 register in each class at the Primary 
 Schools questions about sports. The   
 most popular sport was running. This  
 was because those questioned are fast 
 or they enjoyed it. Skittles is a     
 popular game for adults .
