		<title>01Assington, Hagmore Green</title>
		<content> Assington's population is 382 (1981   
 Census), spread over 145 houses and   
 bungalows, including Grade 1 and 11   
 listed buildings which were part of   
 Gurdon Estate, sold in 1938.          
 Assington Hall, formerly seat of the  
 historic Gurdon family (once visited  
 by Oliver Cromwell) was burnt down in 
 1957; only the ruins remain.  Apart   
 from Assington Thicks (127 acres) and 
 other smaller areas of woodland, the  
 surrounding fields of both Assington  
 and Hagmore Green are mainly given    
 over to agriculture.  The residential 
 part of the village consists of the   
 street, Barracks road, Dyers Lane and 
 Further Street (along the A134).      
 Working Farms include Park Farm, East 
 Farm, Hill Farm, Mill Farm, Hicks     
 Farm, Assington House, Severals Farm, 
 Home Farm, and Willow Tree Farm (now  
 an orchard).                          </content>
