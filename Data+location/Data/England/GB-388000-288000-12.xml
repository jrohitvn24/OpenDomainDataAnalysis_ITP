		<title>12ST MARY'S CHURCH (C.E.)</title>
		<content>{St. Mary's Church}was mentioned in the
 original{Domesday Book}of 1086; the   
 base of its square tower is still the 
 original{Norman}stonework. The church 
 and its precincts abound in history.  
 For example, in the grounds near to   
 the Lych Gate, is a Saxon Preaching   
 Cross which is thought to have once   
 stood at "The Cross", Kingswinford,   
 in the present settlement.            
 Several of the old gravestones are    
 thought to have been used by Oliver   
 Cromwell's men in the{seventeenth     
{century}to sharpen their swords and   
 pikes. (Deep grooves are on them).    
 At one time St. Mary's Church was in  
 the centre of the village but nowadays
 it lies very much on its outskirts.   
 Nevertheless it has an active         
 congregation and very regular worship 
 with a vicar and a curate to serve the
 parish's pastoral needs.              </content>
