		<title>14       SPORTS GROUNDS</title>
		<content>  Most of south Chiswick is covered by 
 sports grounds leased from the        
 Council. We visited the Civil Service 
 ground which has 10% of local people  
 as members. They usually come by car  
 or public transport, but on special   
 occasions by coach from all over      
 Britain.                              
                                       
  The Civil Service Sports Ground is 35
 acres, including tennis courts,       
 bowling green, rugby, football and    
 hockey pitches. The ground is open    
 every weekend and most Wednesdays. The
 busiest time is from early June till  
 mid-July. If they are in a team,      
 employees get half a day off to play, 
 and more if it is a national team.    
                                       
  This year they have had problems with
 vandals slitting the inflated cover of
 the tennis courts.                    </content>
