{few people keep them for the table.   
 Some{children have}their own{hamsters.
 Others keep{fish}in tanks.There are   
{many horses}around.They are kept in   
 fields and stables by families who    
 like riding.{The nearest vet's surgery
 is in{West Ilsley}about{five miles

 who have no{transport.Occasionally    
{people tire of their young pets and   
{dump them outside the village.They die
{unless some-one finds them in time.
