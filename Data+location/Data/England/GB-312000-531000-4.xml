		<content> There are three types of houses on the
 estate, detatched, semi-detached and  
 bungalows. Most of the houses are     
 semi-detached, a small percentage are 
 detached and bungalows.               
   The estate was built in the late    
 1950's and is bordered on one side by 
 the Castlegate site of Cockermouth    
 school and on the other by the cottage
 hospital.                             
   In the centre of the estate there is
 a large green area for recreation and 
 there is also a small park on the     
 north edge of the estate.             
   There are no shops on the estate,   
 but there several post boxes.
