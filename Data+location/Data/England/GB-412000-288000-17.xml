		<content>The major part of the block is covered 
by non-industrial land and premises.   
However, the section immediately north 
of the M6 Motorway is quite densely    
industrialised. The largest single area
is occupied by Fort Dunlop and its     
associated premises, devoted to the    
production of rubber-based goods.In    
particular tyres for motor vehicles are
made here.                             
          Other premises are mainly    
occupied by companies contributing     
metal parts to the motor trade. Small, 
independent metal manufacturers occupy 
units in a group of manufacturing      
premises.                              
         There is also evidence of     
industrial capacity which is surplus to
current needs with a number of vacant  
medium-sized units. Some of these are  
now being used as warehouses for Boots 
the Chemist.                           </content>
