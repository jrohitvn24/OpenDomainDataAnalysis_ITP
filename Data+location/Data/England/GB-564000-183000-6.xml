 When he first begain in business he   
 shoed horses mainly, especially during
 the war when all metal was used in war
 projects.  As farmers could afford    
 tractors there was less work for him  
 and his job in the lat 1950's was to  
 repair the broken farm gear.  When we 
 joined the Common Market funds were   
 available to replace the old machinery
 with more modern equipment.  At this  
 time he had to find other ways he     
 could make use of his skill again.    
 Nowadays he welds, makes wrought iron 
 gates and fireplaces.  He sometimes   
 makes parts for things that are no    
 longer available.  He works behind the
 Co-op Shop.  The Shop and his space is
 wanted for redevelopment.  Many       
 villagers signed a decision has been  
 deferred for a time.
