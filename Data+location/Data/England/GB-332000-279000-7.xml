		<content> COAL.  Many people still use open coal
 fires for warmth.                     
 GAS. There is no mains gas available  
 but Calor Gas in sealed containers for
 cooking is delivered from agencies in 
 Craven Arms or collected from a depot 
 in the old railway station yard at    
 Broome.                               
 ELECTRICITY. The area is connected to 
 the national grid.                    
 OIL. Most systems of central heating  
 are oil based.                        
 WOOD.  A great deal of wood is burned 
 on open fires and in wood burning     
 stoves. Some is gleaned from dead     
 trees and prunings and some offcuts   
 from the Forestry Commission or wood  
 from local merchants.                 
 WATER. Clunton is now connected to    
 the mains system but there is a tap   
 outside the old schoolroom which is   
 spring water.                         </content>
