		<title>17A TYPICAL SUNDAY MORNING</title>
		<content> My{Sunday}morning{lifestyle}is like   
 this. I get up at 9 o'clock. The      
 rest of my{family}are usually still   
 asleep. I try to make as much noise as
 I can, like pulling the chain on the  
 toilet and running the tap. I do this 
 to wake my brother up who would stay  
 in bed all day if he could. I go      
 downstairs into the kitchen and get   
 myself some orange juice as I can't   
 stand tea or coffee. If I have woken  
 my brother he emerges from his bedroom
 and clumps downstairs. I take my Mum  
 and Dad some tea that is if I don't   
 trip over the dog on the stairs. I    
 then get into my jeans and go round to
 my friend Lizzy's house. She's usually
 asleep or in her nightdress. If by    
 some miracle she's ready we go round  
 to Susie's house and{play}'Nine Nine' 
 or 'Leap Frog' or take the dog for a  
 walk. I go home for lunch at 1.00pm.  </content>
