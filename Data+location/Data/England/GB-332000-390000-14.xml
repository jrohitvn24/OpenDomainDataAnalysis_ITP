		<content>   The  architect  won an award for his
 design of St Anthony's,RC, Scotland Rd
 a tall building  with panoramic views.
{  Features include a library, an audio
{-visual room and large resource areas.
{Outside  are  large  playing  fields, 
{yards and garden plots for the pupils.
{ }When  it  was  suggested  that, with
 secondary  reorganisation, the  school
 could  absorb  first  year  seniors, a
 large  classroom  was converted into a
 science unit,with laboratory equipment
 at  one  end  and   domestic  science 
 equipment at the other.               
  {The plan was not pursued  &amp; the unit
{has  given  the junior school a boost.
  This summer will see important change
 on the site. Alterations &amp; extra rooms
 will make provision for infant pupils,
 in spite of the fact that the school's
 future  is  uncertain  until  primary 
 reorganisation  in  two  years  time. </content>
