		<title>16The Plume School</title>
		<content> The Plume-an amalgamation of Maldon   
 Grammar and Secondary schools-        
 originated as Maldon Grammar School in
 1407 on the site where the library is 
 today. It moved to its present site in
 Fambridge Road in 1907.In 1971 it     
 became comprehensive and was renamed  
 The Plume School after the late Dr.   
 Thomas Plume.                         
   Today the Plume is located in two   
 separate buildings-the Lower School   
 and the Upper School. The Lower       
 School,which used to be the Secondary 
 Modern in Wantz Road,houses all First 
 and Second Year pupils.The Upper in   
 Fambridge Road, houses years Three to 
 Six. The school has about 2100 pupils 
 making it one of the largest in       
 England.The school takes its badge    
 from the Maldon Town badge which shows
 3 lions rampant and a ship.
