		<title>05         Roads.</title>
		<content>   As our area is very rural and       
 contains many villages most of the    
 roads are narrow country lanes linking
 the small farming communities together
 like an intricate pattern. There are  
 still many tracks and rights-of-ways  
 clearly marked although the farmers   
 have ploughed up some or marked others
 with their own signs to keep visitors 
 from damaging crops or letting cattle 
 out by not shutting gates.            
   The two main roads in our area are  
 the A35 which runs from Bridport to   
 Dorchester and then on to Poole. The  
 other main road is the A37 which runs 
 from Yeovil to Dorchester. Recently   
 this road has been improved at        
 Charminster and lower Wrackleford.    
 They both become choked with holiday  
 traffic in the summer.
