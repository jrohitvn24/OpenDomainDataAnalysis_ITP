		<title>10A Special Day At Our School.</title>
		<content>   On the 20th June 1985 Durrington    
 Junior School turned the clock back to
 the Victorian Days.Everybody had to   
 dress up in Victorian Clothes.When we 
 got to school we had to line up in    
 alphabetical order according to our   
 surnames.                             
   In our first{Victorian Lesson}Miss  
 Payne came in and showed us how to    
 make a paper serviette.Victorian      
 children used to do this very well but
 we made a mess of it.Then Mr Bavin    
 (our Headmaster) came in and we had to
 recite a poem.Later we went outside to
 Toe The Line,a form of Victorian      
 Punishment.No one dared to step over  
 the line.The penalty was to recite a  
 nursery rhyme.                        
   In the afternoon we played Victorian
 Games and a photographer took pictures
 of us.We also made and ate some       
 gruel,it was awful.                   </content>
