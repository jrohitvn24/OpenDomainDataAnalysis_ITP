		<content> There are two playgroups in Abbots    
 Bromley. This morning we went to the  
 St. Nicholas playgroup and they are   
 there from nine to twelve and at break
 they have milk orange and a biscuit.  
 On sunny days they go for a walk in   
 the church yard. There are twenty     
 three children altogether but only    
 fifteen are allowed to go at one time.
 In the winter they have hot chocolate 
 and toast. The names are Natalie,     
 Rebecca, Edward, Gary, Oliver, Lydia, 
 Naomi, Charles, Catherine, Esther,    
 Emily and the teachers are Gill and   
 Debbie. For Christmas they have toast 
 and hot chocolate.
