		<title>18Meadowland birds in Fulford</title>
		<content> The pheasant is common in Fulford.They
 are bred by farmers as game birds but 
 have established themselves in the    
 wild.They feed on corn,turnips, worms,
 acorns, insects and beetles. Nests are
 found on the ground, in hedge bottoms 
 and undergrowth. The wood pigeon is   
 regarded as a pest by local farmers as
 large flocks eat the corn.It nests in 
 high trees where it cannot be attacked
 by predators.The magpie,an attractive 
 bird, steals eggs and fledglings from 
 small birds. Its nest is domed and is 
 usually found in small trees. Although
 seen in gardens it is more frequently 
 seen on farmland in the area. The     
 kestrel is a commom bird of prey which
 likes to hunt near the A64 and A19    
 where small rodents are aroused.      
 Occasionally it takes worms, small    
 birds and young rabbits.
