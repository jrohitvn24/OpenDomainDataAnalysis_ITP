		<title>01THE DESIGNATED AREA.</title>
		<content> The block studied covers a portion of 
{rural SW.Cheshire.The area is sparsely
{populated with two small villages and 
{four hamlets.}Wrenbury is more densely
 populated than Marbury.The volume of  
 traffic is greater and it benefits    
 from more ameneties.Both have Anglican
 churches and primary schools.There are
{no classified roads.}A railway crosses
 the area but the local station is     
 outside the study area.The land is    
 intersected by the{Shropshire Union   
{Canal}and though popular for holidays 
 is no longer used for freight.{Tourism
 centres on canal users and those      
 arriving by car.Most of the land is   
 gently undulating, used as pasture by 
 the many{dairy farms}which are famous 
 in this area.No other industry exists,
 but limited part time work,mainly for 
 women is available as domestic help,in
 the shops, public house and schools.  </content>
