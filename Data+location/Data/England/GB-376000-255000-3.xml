 transferred to him through a personal 
 radio which he carries around with him
 ,and when he is in his car he gets    
 them through a VHF radio.             
    To be a good Village Policeman he  
 believes that the qualities a man     
 needs is patience, tolerance,         
 understanding and the ability to      
 listen patiently to the many problems 
 that people bring to him. Above all a 
 sense of humour is required.          
    He gets one week-end off each month
 and he likes to spend his time in the 
 garden, watching television and       
 reading. As often as possible he likes
 to get away from the village and take 
 his family with him to visit relatives
 and friends. This gives him a break   
 which is so important.
