 their playing field, called The       
 Triangle. The School also has a Chess 
 team, which plays in the local Primary
 Schools Chess League.

 Otterton, called the Jubillee Playing 
 Field. It has a collection of wooden  
 items of equipment like slides,frames 
 and see-saws. Lord Clinton opened it.
