		<title>12Westonzoyland Airfield</title>
		<content> The airfield to the north of the      
 village was originally established    
 just after the First World War when it
 was used for training purposes by the 
 R.F.C.  At that time it consisted of  
 grass strips and tented accomodation. 
 At the outbreak of the Second World   
 War large areas of land were          
 compulsory purchased by the War       
 Ministry, and a much larger airfield  
 with concrete runways and permanent   
 buildings was constructed. During the 
 war the R.A.F. and U.S.A.F. used the  
 airfield mainly for bomber squadrons, 
 although towards the end it was used  
 for training glider pilots for the    
 Arnhiem Raid.  The airfield was closed
 in 1954. Much of the land was         
 reclaimed for agriculture but there   
 are still large areas of runway left  
 which are used for private aircraft   
 and even for flying model aircraft.   </content>
