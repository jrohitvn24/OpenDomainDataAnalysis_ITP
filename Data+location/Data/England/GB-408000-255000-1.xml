		<content>       Our D.Block is mainly{farming   
 land but it includes the main part of 
 Alcester and also Oversley Wood.      
 Alcester is built on the site of a    
 Roman Town.Many Roman remains have    
 been found.                           
       Alcester is still a market      
 town,but it is growing bigger.Ragley  
 Hall is near Alcester where hunts go  
 on,it is also open to the             
 public.Opposite Ragley Hall is Arrow  
 Mill,now a restaurant and bar.        
       The centre of everything is the 
 High Street with St Nicholas' churchat
 the end.Shops line the street.There is
 a grammer school and two comprehensive
 schools.Also there are two junior and 
 infant schools,and playgroups.Alcester
 is twinned with the French town of    
 Vallet.Altogether Alcester is a       
 friendly little town.
