		<title>11Willoughby Station</title>
		<content>  The line of the Great Northern       
 Railway runs almost N/S through the D 
 block. Opened on 1/3/1848 it closed on
 5/10/1970.During its life it fulfilled
 three functions; local mixed traffic, 
 main link from Grimsby to London      
 for the fish trade and connection     
 between N.Midlands and S.Yorks        
 conurbations and East Coast resorts of
 Mablethorpe and Skegness.             
  Access to Mablethorpe was via the    
 single track line that left Willoughby
 junction (its now a nature reserve    
 owned by Lincs and S.Humberside Trust)
 and looped through Sutton on Sea to   
 Mablethorpe, rejoining at Louth.      
 During its heyday traffic was heavy in
 the summer with excursions from       
 Nottingham, Derby and Sheffield       
 running from early morning until      
 midnight. Being a junction Willoughby 
 was more important than Alford.       </content>
