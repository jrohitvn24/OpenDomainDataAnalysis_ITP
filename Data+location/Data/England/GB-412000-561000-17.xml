		<title>17LOCAL HISTORY - GREENSIDE.</title>
		<content>  The Lead Road runs through our       
 village. This road ran from Tyneside  
 to Weardale where the lead miners used
 to be. The miners carried the lead ore
 on pack horses and carts along the    
 road. The pack horses stopped at a    
 public house called "The Bird". This  
 is now Mr Robinson's farm in the      
 middle of the village.                
  Greenside was a coal mining village, 
 but it is no longer because the mine  
 was closed down. On the Temperence    
 Green was a pond which was the pit    
 pond. Behind Burnhills Gardens was a  
 "dilly" line. This was a railway line 
 with small trucks on and the miners   
 put coal in the trucks to send down   
 the railway line to the next stop. The
 miners used to send coal to Stargate  
 on this line. It is now a line which  
 is overgrown with bushes, grass and   
 flowers.                              </content>
