		<title>03Flora off the A52</title>
		<content>    Although the{A52}is such a busy    
 road, we noticed a surprising thing   
 about it. It has quite wide verges and
 a wide central reservation and along  
 these grow a great variety of wild    
 flowers and grasses.                  
    Screening the fields from the road 
 are{hawthorn}hedges which are a       
 picture in Spring when they are       
 covered in white blossom and in Autumn
 when they have red berries. Growing   
 beneath the hedge, the{willow herb}is 
 just coming out. Bright red{poppies   
 dance among clouds of white{cow       
{parsley,}called kek by country people.
 There are patches of blue{meadow      
{cranesbill}and white{campion.}Spiky   
{thistles}with lovely purple flowers   
 stand out above the smaller flowers of
 yellow{hedge mustard}and white        
{mayweed,}while stinging{nettles}deter 
 people from spoiling the beauty.      </content>
