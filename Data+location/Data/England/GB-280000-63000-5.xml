		<content> We went to Torbay Hunter and Pony     
 Feeds.  They have 73 acres of land of 
 which 12 are rented to them.  They    
 have eight horses on livery and two of
 their own.  They also have a few      
 sheep, a heifer cow in calf and a pig.
 Their shop used to be a farrowing     
 shed.  For agricultural equipment they
 have two tractors, a combine, a       
 fertiliser spreader, a baler, a front 
 loader and an elevator.  They deliver 
 to the door.  Nearly all of their     
 trade is local.  They make an adequate
 living and enjoy running the business.
 They sell their produce in the shop   
 and the sheep in Newton Abbot market. 
 They store their supplies in a shed   
 and the shop.  This business started  
 as a farm and they sold feed to their 
 friends and gradually the food became 
 more important than the farm.
