		<content> Lancaster University is the largest   
 employer in the area. It has brought  
 much employment and trade.There are   
 650 academic staff who teach both     
 undergraduates and post graduates. 250
 men and women are employed in the     
 university as engineers, secretaries  
 and technicians in the administration 
 and teaching departments. Besides     
 these there are 500 ancillary workers;
 kitchen staff, porters, groundsmen    
 etc. Thus around 1400 people have job 
 directly because of the university.   
 Outside the university the only other 
 jobs are to be found on farms and most
 farms seem to be run by the family who
 owns them. The University also gives  
 rise to jobs outside our area in      
 neighbouring towns and villages. The  
 students and staff bring trade to     
 shops, catering establishments, pubs  
 etc.They increase use of transport too</content>
