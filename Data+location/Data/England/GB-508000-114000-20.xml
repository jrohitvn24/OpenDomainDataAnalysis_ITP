 figure outside was presented to Vera  
 as a symbol of the open door which was
 part of her faith. With the coming of 
 modern amenities most settlers asked  
 for legal rights to their land and    
 were inclined to sell their now       
 "desirable property" and drift back to
 the world they once deserted. Vera    
 married, giving the remaining land to 
 her artist husband and the name of his
 estate became known as "Sleepy        
 Hollow". He built the shelter to give 
 tired pedestrians a chance to rest    
 while enshrining the Sanctuary where a
 very simple Christian gesture caused  
 such interest.
