		<title>17 THE BAILEY AT CASTLE CARY</title>
		<content> The Bailey is off Higher Woodcock     
Street.This round house (bailey) was   
one of only four in the country and was
built in 1779.It was made and bought   
for 22 pounds by Mr.W.M Clark.The keys 
are kept at Spearmans,the toy shop in  
the High street.The round house        
(bailey)was one of the smallest prisons
in the country.There are two doors and 
two keys,the first is the thickest door
with the biggest key,then after that   
there is a smaller key for a thinner   
door.The inside is very dull and musty 
with a stone seat with a hole in the   
middle,to serve as a toilet.The Bailey 
is situated off Higher Woodcock Street.
It was used for keeping drunks in over 
night.If you would like more           
information on the Bailey,there is a   
library just down the road.
