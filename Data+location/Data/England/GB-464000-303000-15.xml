		<content> Near our school is the Polytechnic.   
 Some of the students are training to  
 be teachers,and they come to our      
 school to do school practice.Some     
 times they watch our teacher,some     
 times they take a group,or they take  
 the whole class.When we go on a trip  
 the students come with us.This year we
 have visited several farms and        
 explored the area for our Domesday    
 project.The college grounds are quite 
 interesting,especially the pond  which
 has lots of wild life including       
 mallard ducks.The college is quite    
 modern, but the offices are in the old
 manor house.The house was built in the
 reign of Queen Anne.The front gates   
 are made of wrought iron,and are very 
 beautiful.Sometimes we go to the      
 college to do PE or a play.The        
 students do plays for us at school.
