   The area is a quiet peaceful place  
 without much traffic at all only      
 the odd car or tractor.The land is    
 used for farming and cattle grazing or
 just left fallow to regenerate.There  
 are a few farms and one is called     
 Ferris Court Farm where we went to    
 interview the farmer.He has beef and  
 dairy cattle. The dairy cattle        
 produce on average {1,659 }litres of  
 milk a day which goes to Stroud       
 Creamery.He owns over 300 acres of    
 land on which the dairy and beef      
 cattle graze.He has 60 beef and 110   
 dairy cattle.                         
    An interesting feature about this  
 farm is the fact that he is breeding  
 Fresian Bulls for beef up to 11 months
 old which is comparitively new and    
 unusual.                              </content>
