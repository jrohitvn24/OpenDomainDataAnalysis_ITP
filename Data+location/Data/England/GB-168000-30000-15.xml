		<content>      Our block has one main road      
 running through it, the A394 which    
 links the towns of Falmouth and       
 Helston.  This runs diagonally across 
 our block from NE to SW.  It has one  
 local bus service which uses it, plus 
 an express coach service to Exeter and
 beyond each day.  Recently there have 
 been a lot of road improvements       
 carried out on this road.             
      The B3297 Helston to Redruth road
 just enters our block in the extreme  
 west.  It is still very narrow and    
 full of bends.  There is a bus service
 on this road, but there are not many  
 buses!                                
      Most people in our area live off 
 the main roads and are quite isolated,
 so most have their own car, although a
 lot of elderly people have to rely on 
 buses and this can be very difficult  
 for them.                             </content>
