		<title>11THE BLACKSMITH, BIRCHWOOD</title>
		<content>{                                      
                                       
      Originally the forge at Birchwood
 was run by a family consisting of     
 father, two brothers and a cousin, but
 is now in the hands of one of the     
 brothers.  The pattern of smithing has
 changed so that today the smith       
 travels to many areas and derives much
 of his income from shoeing race       
 horses.  This smith, in fact, shoed   
 the Grand National winner of 1976.    
                                       
      A set of shoes lasts for about   
 six weeks and costs approximately Â£18.
 The forge is fired with small coke and
 the bellows are electrically operated.
 In addition to shoeing the smith makes
 wrought iron work.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
