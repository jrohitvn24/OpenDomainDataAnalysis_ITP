		<content>  The second largest part of           
 Westinghouse is the part that makes   
{Brakes.}These are fitted to all sorts 
 of trains, mainly abroad, and the     
 company works as a subcontractor to   
 other manufacturers.                  
  Another part makes{Semi-Conductors,  
 which are silicon chips used for power
 control, mainly in electric trains.   
 They are manufactured in a place      
 called a "clean room" where the       
 atmosphere has to be kept very pure as
 the silicon chips are cut up.         
  The smallest division of Westinghouse
 makes{Rectifiers.}Here they make      
 static power supply equipment for     
 Alternating Current and Direct        
 Current. Originally this was just for 
 railways but now they are used        
 elsewhere too.
