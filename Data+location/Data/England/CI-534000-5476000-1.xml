		<title>01The Harbour Area, Guernsey</title>
		<content>    Although mostly sea this block does
 have in it a narrow East coast strip  
 of the island of Guernsey that        
 includes the harbour of St.Peter Port.
 As well as serving the basic needs of 
 trade and tourist transport the       
 harbour boasts two yacht marinas, with
 a third under construction.           
    Guarding the entrance to the port  
 is the eight hundred year old Castle  
 Cornet, whilst the Roman wreck        
 recently rescued from the harbour     
 mouth, is also of considerable        
 historical importance.                
    The main source of employment in   
 the area is for harbour staff, dockers
 and fishermen. The Guernsey Yacht Club
 provides recreational facilities and  
 the nearby Aquarium is a place of     
 interest that attracts many visitors  
 during wet weather.
