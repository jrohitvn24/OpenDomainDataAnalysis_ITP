		<title>03Petworth Park</title>
		<content> Petworth Park is in the north-westerly
 part of Petworth. The park covers     
 2,000 acres of land,800 owned by the  
 Natural Trust 1,200 owned privately by
 Lord Egremont. The problems of        
 Petworth Park are the deer eating the 
 young trees,moles digging hills and   
 there are over 1000 trees to be felled
 because they are rotting with old age.
 There is a ditch called 'The Ha Ha'   
 separating the park from the House and
 the Gardens, which prevents the deer  
 damaging the plants and getting killed
 on the road. The park was designed by 
 Capability Brown in 1750. Mr.Webb (the
 education officer) took us round.
