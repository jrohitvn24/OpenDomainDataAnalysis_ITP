		<title>05DUFTON CHURCH</title>
		<content> The sandstone church of St.Cuthbert is
 situated just off a narrow winding    
 road mid-way between the villages of  
 Dufton and Knock.It has a rural       
 setting near the banks of the Swindale
 Beck with views to the nearby fells.  
 The surrounding churchyard is bounded 
 by farmland and is approached by a    
 rough track across pastureland.       
 Dufton's annual agricultural show is  
 held here.                            
 The site is ancient,but the present   
 building is dated 1780.The registers  
 go back to the 16th century and there 
 is a possible Saxon figure on a wall  
 panel in the Chancery.                
 Dufton shares a vicar with the        
 neighbouring 2 parishes,but there is  
 an active congregation and a weekly   
 service.All 3 parishes are joining    
 together at present to produce a revue
 in the church in November.            </content>
