		<content>  Families are mainly composed of a    
 married couple and two or three       
 children. In large farmhouses, often  
 three generations live together. Many 
 teenagers, having their own radios,   
 televisions and computers, spend a lot
 of home time in their bedrooms.       
 Sometimes he only communal time for   
 the family is the evening meal.       
  Both men and women go out to work.   
  Women do most of the housework, with 
 the help of many appliances. Gas,     
 electric, coal or gas cylinders are   
 used for cooking and heating. Homemade
 food is preferred to convience meals. 
 Local dishes like roast beef and      
 Yorkshire pudding are favourite, but  
 vegetarianism is becoming popular.    
  Dogs, annual licence 37 pence, are   
 pets, guard dogs or sheep dogs.
