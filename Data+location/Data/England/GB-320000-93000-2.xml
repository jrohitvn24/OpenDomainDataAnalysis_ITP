    The block of land under survey is  
 dominated by small dairy farms. They  
 occupy from 50 to 100 acres in size   
 and tend to be family farms.          
    The valley floors are improved     
 pasture which is cut in the summer for
 silage,while the meadows are used for 
 grazing.                              
    Other crops grown are maize and    
 wheat for fodder.These are often grown
 in rotation on the ley grass. The hill
 slopes and especially the encarpments 
 support sheep grazing. Apart from this
 some small holders keep pigs and most 
 farms have their own orchards.        
    An important occupation in parts of
 the upper valley are stables. Horses  
 and donkeys are kept for riding.
