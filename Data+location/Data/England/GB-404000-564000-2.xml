		<content> THE LANDSCAPE OF THIS AREA VARIES WITH
 THE SEASONS.IN THE SPRING IT IS       
 DOMINATED BY THE BRILLIANT YELLOW OF  
 OIL SEED RAPE.THERE HAVE BEEN         
 COMPLAINTS THAT TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS MAY 
 HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY DRIVERS BEING     
 DAZZLED BY THE YELLOW GLARE BUT IT HAS
 NOT BEEN PROVED.AS THIS FADES THE     
 COLOUR TURNS TO SHADES OF GREEN AND   
 BROWN AS TREES BURST INTO LEAF AND    
 CEREAL CROPS GROW AND RIPEN.THERE ARE 
 THREE SMALL WOODS,TWO ARE             
 PREDOMINATELY DECIDUOUS AND ONE       
 CONIFEROUS.THEY BREAK UP THE LANDSCAPE
 AND PROVIDE FOOD AND SHELTER FOR SMALL
 BIRDS AND ANIMALS.TWO BURNS,A LOCAL   
 WORD FOR STREAM,RUN THROUGH THE SQUARE
 ONE, WHITTLE BURN,HAS A BRIDLE PATH   
 RUNNING ALONGSIDE IT CALLED WHITTLE   
 DENE.A MAJOR TRUNK ROAD,THE A695      
 RUNNING FROM NEWCASTLE TO CARLISLE VIA
 HEXHAM TRANSECTS THE AREA.            </content>
