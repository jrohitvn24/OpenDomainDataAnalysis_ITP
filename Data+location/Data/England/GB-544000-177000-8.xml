		<title>08CHILD'S OPINION OF PLUMSTEAD</title>
		<content>When I was 8yrs of age I used to live  
in Crystal Palace. It is a very clean  
place to live in,your neighbours are   
very good to you and they help out if  
you're in any trouble. My old door     
number was 70 and my door was red with 
black spirals. After that we moved to  
Elmley St., that block has smashed     
glass and graffiti all over the walls  
and still the caretaker doesn't do any 
thing about it.It's horrible,they      
should do something about it.Every day 
I go down the shgops and sign posts are
dented and smashed, windows are        
shattered, car tyres are let down.     
Shops have fences over their windows.  
I don't do nothing like that in my     
block. My door colour is blue and my   
door number is one nine three. My      
favorite colour is brown and my bedroom
is all brown.
