 The area provides a variety of        
 interesting habitats,natural and man  
 made.The River Rother floods regularly
 providing feeding grounds for birds   
 although the river itself is heavily  
 polluted.There are many ancient       
 hedgerows which provide a rich habitat
 and food supply for many small animals
 and birds.The areas of rough grazing  
 provide a more environment for        
 birds,such as skylarks and lapwings   
 and small mammals,such as rabbits and 
 foxes and shrews.Foxstone             
 wood,Whinnybank wood and the man made 
 lake,which was originally constructed 
 to provide water for coal washing at  
 Renishaw pit,provide an attractive    
 home for woodland species as it is an 
 area of mixed planting.               </content>
