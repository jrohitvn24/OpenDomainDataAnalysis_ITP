 I reach home at 6-15p.m.,have my tea  
 and watch the news and tennis (from   
 Wimbledon) on television until 7-30   
 p.m.Tonight is quiz night at Leeholme 
 Working Men's Club.I go there with    
 three of my friends,one of whom takes 
 his car.There are 10 teams in the     
 competition,and 4 people in each team.
 The entry fee is 25 pence per person. 
 The questions vary enormously,and the 
 quiz lasts roughly 2 hours.Tonight,our
 team wins by 3 points,the first prize 
 being Â£8. We leave the Club at about  
 10-30p.m.,and I arrive home at 11-00  
 p.m. to watch 'Newsnight'_a news and  
 current affairs television programme _
 before I retire to bed.
