		<title>14Totternhoe Community Police</title>
		<content> The village community police man is   
 P.C. Slade-Pedrick.  He lives in      
 Totternhoe and his children have been 
 to the school.  He is community       
 policeman for this village and several
 other neighbouring ones.  He comes    
 regularly to school and talks to the  
 children about the work of a          
 policeman, local dangers, road        
 safety and shows films such as "Dont  
 Go With Strangers".  He undertakes    
 similar work with other groups in his 
 catchment area.  There is an annual   
 programme of visits to this school but
 it was all thrown into confusion by   
 his being called to police duty in the
 North during the Miner's Strike.      
 Our local police stations are in      
 Dunstable and Leighton Buzzard.  The  
 school has recently entered a painting
 competition organised by the local    
 police.  We won two prizes.           </content>
