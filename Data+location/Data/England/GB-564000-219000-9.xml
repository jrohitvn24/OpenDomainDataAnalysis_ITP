		<title>09Changing Industry in Felsted</title>
		<content>   The British Sugar Corporation       
 factory in Felsted opened in 1926 as a
 processing unit employing 290 people. 
 In February 1981 the processing unit  
 was closed for economic reasons - the 
 factory being old needed an enormous  
 amount of money spent on it to        
 modernise it and to make it much more 
 efficient and this was not considered 
 practical.                            
   Since 1981 the factory has been used
 purely as a warehouse and distribution
 centre employing 26 people mainly from
 the Felsted area.  Closing the        
 processing unit did not affect the    
 local farmers too much as their main  
 crops are wheat, barley and oilseed   
 rape, but of course it did have an    
 effect on employment locally.  The    
 British Sugar Corporation have no     
 plans, for the immediate future, which
 concern the factory in Felsted.       </content>
