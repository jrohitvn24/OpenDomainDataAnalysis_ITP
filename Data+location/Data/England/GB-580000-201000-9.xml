		<title>09Old houses</title>
		<content>    In Purleigh is a 16th Century      
 thatched cottage called 'Peppers'. Its
 name is derived from an old lady who  
 lived there. Everybody in the village 
 called her Granny Pepper,so,when she  
 died,the daughter of next door's owner
 bought the house and named it Peppers.
    Peppers has just become a listed   
 building which means it is one of the 
 oldest buildings in Britain.          
    The front door belonged to a       
 church in South Woodham Ferrers and at
 one time the house was taken to       
 bits.The wooden beams were numbered,  
 and you can still see some of the     
 numbers scratched on.
