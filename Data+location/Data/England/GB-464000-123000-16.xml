		<title>16A TYPICAL DAY AT SCHOOL</title>
		<content> When I got to school I hung up my coat
 and talked in the playground until we 
 went in at 9.00. Miss Selby came in   
 and asked us about the news and we    
 talked about the recent earthquake in 
 Mexico. Then we watched Music Time    
 and went out to play. I played Stuck  
 in the Mud and It. When we came in I  
 did maths till 11.50 when we packed up
 so that the tables could be laid for  
 dinner. We played before lunch then   
 said a prayer. We had chips, carrots, 
 peas and beefburger,and Swiss Roll. We
 went out to play but at 12.30 6 of us 
 girls got our recorders and practised 
 until Mrs.Hunt came and then she      
 helped us. At 1.00 we got on with our 
 English work until 2.15. After 15     
 mins. play we had to write a script   
 for a play which I did with 6 friends.
 At 3.30 we said a prayer and went     
 home.                 KATHRYN ABRAHAM </content>
