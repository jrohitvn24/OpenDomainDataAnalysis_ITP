		<content> The square involved includes no       
 villages,Melton Ross village lies to  
 the South East and Elsham village to  
 the West. Inhabited buildings are     
 found in only 4 of the 12 grid        
 squares,generally in small clusters.  
 All inhabited houses and warehouse    
 premises have an electricity supply   
 from the Y.E.B.Most houses are on     
 mains water but not mains sewerage.   
 In the north of our area, adjacent    
 to Race lane, high on the Wolds, there
 is a small Gas Installation,commission
 -ed in 1964.This equipment takes a    
 supply of North Sea Natural Gas at    
 high pressure from an underground pipe
 -line, and reduces it's pressure for  
 distribution to parts of South Humber 
 -side.Singleton Birch quarry Kilns are
 a nearby major user of North Sea Gas.
