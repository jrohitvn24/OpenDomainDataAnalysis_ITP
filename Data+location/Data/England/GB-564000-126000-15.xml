		<title>15Hop Farming in Stonegate</title>
		<content> The hop plant is planted under a frame
 work of timber and wire 16feet high.In
 the spring the hop starts to grow from
 the root stock which is left in the   
 ground year after year.Each hop plant 
 is called a hop hill.During April the 
 hops are strung using a very long     
 pole.Each hop hill has a screw peg to 
 which the string is hooked,and special
 hooks at the top of the wire.Each hop 
 hill has 4 strings.There are 1000     
 plants to 1 acre.When the hops are    
 long enough they have to be trained to
 grow up the strings.This is done by   
 winding two bines clockwise up a      
 string.They will not grow any other   
 way - it is an endless task that has  
 to be done 3 or 4 times,until the     
 bines reach the top of the wire.By    
 this time the hops are starting to    
 flower or form.
