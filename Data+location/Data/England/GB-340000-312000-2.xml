		<title>02POPULATION OF FORD</title>
		<content>    The population of {FORD } is about 
 400-500.There is a majority of        
 middle-aged and older people.Quite a  
 few of these people have been resident
 for all of their lives.Most of the    
 younger people have moved to          
{ SHREWSBURY },while the older people  
 have stayed there.The main feeling is 
 that more young people should be      
 encouraged to move to the area.       
    The reason for them leaving is that
 there are no permanent facilities e.g.
 cinemas,discos and night-clubs.Also   
 there is not much oppurtunity to  get 
 a job in{FORD. SHREWSBURY}is situated 
 seven miles away so transport is      
 needed to get there.Since most young  
 people do not have their own transport
 they go to live in{SHREWSBURY.}So,from
 this evidence,we see that{FORD}is a   
 village in decline at the moment.
