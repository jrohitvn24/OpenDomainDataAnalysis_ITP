		<title>18FARMING IN CHITTERNE</title>
		<content> There are four farm businesses within 
 the area, the largest controlling     
 1,117 acres, the smallest 1O5 acres.  
 They provide very little employment.  
 6O% of the land is taken up for       
 cereals, 3O% for fatstock, 5% dairy   
 cattle and 5% woodland.               
 Sheep are kept for their meat.        
 Fleeces, which provide very little    
 profit, are of secondary concern.     
 Lambs are bought by abbatoirs as far  
 away as Tiverton in Devon. Ewes for   
 breeding are bought from the north of 
 England, and sheep are brought to this
 area from the north and Wales to      
 overwinter.                           
 Animals are taken to market in        
 Salisbury, Frome and Chippenham.
