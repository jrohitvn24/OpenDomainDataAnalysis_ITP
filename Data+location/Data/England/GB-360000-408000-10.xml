		<title>10THE LOCO WORKS AND RED MOSS</title>
		<content>   On the extreme north-east of the    
 area, is the{British Rail Engineering 
{and Locomotive Works(Horwich          
{Division),}but this has declined      
 extensively in recent years, from     
 nearly 2000 employees in the 1950's to
 only about 150, who are still employed
 in the foundry. The block to the north
 will cover this in more detail.       
   In the northern part, is a large    
 peat moss called{Red Moss}which has   
 been steadily worked over the past    
 thirty years. One edge of this has    
 been used recently by Greater         
 Manchester Council and other local    
 authorities as a{tip.                 
   In the extreme south-east is{       
{Fourgates Engineering}making sun-beds 
 and plastic sheeting. They employ     
 about twelve people. The building used
 to be the{school}before new premises  
 were built across the road.           </content>
