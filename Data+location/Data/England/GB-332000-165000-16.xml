		<title>16A VIEW FROM A CLASSROOM</title>
		<content>                                       
 We have a fantastic view from our     
 classroom.   We can see all of        
 Kewstoke, Sand Bay and Sand Point.    
 We can also see part of the Bristol   
 Channel, which is a sort of greeny    
 brown colour.  Behind Sand Point we   
 can see Wales.  I can see factory     
 chimneys.                             
 We can also see many fields out of the
 classroom window.  There are about 100
 of them and they are all different    
 colours, with hedges which separate   
 them.                                 
 We can see Woodspring Priory in the   
 distance and it does not look very    
 big.  There is a lot of cattle in the 
 fields. The cows are Fresians.  We can
 see Elmsley Nursery, a white house,   
 where eggs and milk can be bought.
