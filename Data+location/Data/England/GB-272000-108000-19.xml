 In Lapford these are two popular{ghost
{stories.}One is about the Grange.It   
 goes that once a mad rector lived     
 there,he one day pushed a maid in the 
 pond and she drowned,but where her    
 hand scrapped the bank,grass is said  
 never to have grown again.Also there  
 is this one it is connected with the  
 church.Our church is one built by {   
{Hugh de Tracy}who was one of the      
 soldiers to kill {Thomas Becket.}The  
 stories vary but this is the one that 
 most people know.On the 27th of       
 December in the evening his ghost     
 rides by on a horse.He goes past the  
 church and then on up the village.
