		<content> A locally well known beauty spot,the  
 farm has been made into a caravan site
 which is open from mid March to mid   
 November.  Two families of two sisters
 with their husbands and four children 
 have been operating the caravan site  
 since November 1984 having moved to   
 the property from Manchester and      
 Preston.  They enjoyed their first    
 winter there and found a strong       
 contrast in their life style after    
 having been owners of a large public  
 house.  The children especially like  
 to travel to school some three miles  
 daily to Moretonhampstead by school   
 bus or the family Land Rover when     
 there is snow and the bus is unable to
 negotiate the steep and narrow lanes.
