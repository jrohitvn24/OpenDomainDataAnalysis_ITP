		<title>19Leaden Roding Police 2</title>
		<content> The local Policeman works an 8 hour   
 day for 7 days then he has 2 or 3 days
 off. He does have to carry his        
 identification around with him at all 
 times. He has been trained in First   
 Aid and Riot Control and he has to go 
 on courses every 2 to 3 years. Three  
 Policemen are on duty at any one time 
 in the area, plus the Traffic         
 Department. There is no cell in Leaden
 Roding for prisoners, they now have to
 be sent to Harlow or Saffron Walden.  
 If help is needed then a call is sent 
 to Dunmow. In an emergency the nearest
 cars would assist. As well as his     
 normal duties ,the local Policeman    
 spends time in school, teaching the   
 "Green Cross Code", telling the       
 children something of the History of  
 the Police, telling the children not  
 to go with strangers and taking the   
 children for Cycling Proficiency.     </content>
