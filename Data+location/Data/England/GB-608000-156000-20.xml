		<title>20 The Beauty of Old England</title>
		<content>Flora and fauna abound in this heavily 
wooded and rural area.Violets,wood     
anemones,bluebells,campions and        
countless other varieties of           
flowers.Dozens of woodland paths wander
through areas of woodland and          
coppicing.Sweet chestnut and silver    
birch are common and oak,ash,beech and 
alder as well as patches of conifer.Red
wood ants build their nests in many of 
the woods.Insect life is everywhere and
field and woodland birds abound.We     
heard a nightingale sing.We saw a fox  
and suspected badgers in the woods.With
the ancient Pilgrims Way and many      
bridleways the tired town or city      
dweller can walk or ride through some  
of the most attractive countryside in  
England.It is soft,matured,gentle      
countryside now,after centuries of toil
from man,but satisfying and very safe.
