		<title>18My Den</title>
		<content> Behind my house on Little Meadow is a 
 large area of waste ground-well it's  
 not really waste as it is owned by    
{Knappe Cross House}which is an old    
 house used as a pub and restaurant. On
 Saturdays and in the holidays I call  
 for my friends Georgina and Matthew   
 and we push through the hole we have  
 made in the hedge. We always put some 
 flowers on the grave of a blackbird   
 which died in front of our very eyes. 
 The den we are making is built of old 
 sheets of tin and scrap wood. I don't 
 know where it comes from as nobody is 
 supposed to dump rubbish there. We    
 have invented lots of secret whistles 
 and calls so we know who is coming and
 we have a trip-wire which fires a     
 wooden spear if it is one of our      
 enemies! Other people go to our den   
 and I suppose we will get there one   
 day and find it wrecked.              </content>
