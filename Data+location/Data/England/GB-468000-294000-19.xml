		<content>{TUR LANGTON CHURCH _ ST. ANDREWS      
                                       
    The church was built on a field in 
 the centre of the village and replaced
 an earlier church which was too far   
 away and too small for most of the    
 villagers. It is said to be one of the
 most important  Victorian churches in 
 Leicestershire.                       
    Red brick was used in its          
 construction and the glass in the     
 windows is tinted yellow. It has not  
 been altered since it was built in    
 1866, and it is still in use today    
 although the congregation is small.
