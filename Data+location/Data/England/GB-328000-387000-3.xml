		<title>03Children's Outdoor Games</title>
		<content>       The games played by children are
 very  varied  mixing  the  traditional
 with  the  modern. Chasing  games  are
 very  popular  and  come  under  many 
 different  titles:  Cops-and-Robbers, 
 Donkey Tick  and Witches Pot. They all
 have one child trying to capture other
 children and placing them in some sort
 of den,  circles  drawn  on the ground
 for  example.                         
     Ball  games  are  also  popular.  
 Football and cricket are easily played
 on  any  open  ground. Ball tick games
 are  many  and  varied.               
   There  are some pavement games still
 being  played.  Hop-scotch  and  mine 
 fields  are  examples,  where  paving 
 stones are used  as  stepping  stones.
 Stepping  on  the wrong pavement means
 losing  the  game. 25% of the children
 surveyed played outdoor games often.
