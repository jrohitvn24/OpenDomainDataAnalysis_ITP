		<content> The church was last restored in       
 1886.We found the graveyard a most    
 interesting place.There were well     
 over 200 graves.It was difficult to   
 count them because some didn't have   
 headstones and some plots held more   
 than one body.The oldest headstone we 
 found was in the porch and about a    
 John Barne of Bodharlocke who died in 
 1624.It was in old fashioned writing  
 and spelling.The newest grave was of  
 the local vicar,the Rev.Patrick       
 Howlett who died in August 1985.We    
 found these names on headstones,whose 
 families are still in the area today:-
{FRANCIS, BURDEN,COLVILLE,FRAYN,SMART  
 and{CORY.                             
 The names on these headstones are of  
 families who are no longer in the     
 district today:-{GEAKE,COUCH,JENKINS, 
{FACY,BLYTHE,SLEEMAN,KITTOW}and{HOLMAN.
