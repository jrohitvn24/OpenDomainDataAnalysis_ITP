		<title>19BRANDON LANE GOLF COURSE</title>
		<content> The course belongs to{Coventry Council
{Leisure Services Dept.}and is situated
 along the west bank of the river{Avon 
 about 10Kms from the city centre.     
  The course covers{213 acres,}but only
{135 acres}are played on:The remainder 
 is scrub and wetland at present.      
  There are{18 holes, Par 72.}About    
{42000 rounds}are played a year. There 
 is also a Driving Range, a Putting    
 Green and a Clubhouse.                
  The major problem is the frequency of
{flooding}which puts many holes out of 
 use. There are several reserve holes  
 for just such a situation but more are
 needed. Hence there are{plans}to turn 
 the wetlands into standby holes. This 
 is, however, being strongly fought by 
 local{conservationists.}The Groundsman
{Mr.T. Curtis}feels that the course    
 does{help wildlife}already and it also
{helps people}to relax.                </content>
