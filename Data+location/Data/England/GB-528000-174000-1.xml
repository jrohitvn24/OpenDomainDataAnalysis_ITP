		<title>01A Muslim living in Stockwell</title>
		<content>   My name is Fatima and my mum and dad
originally came  from South Africa.  I 
am a Muslim living in Stockwell.  My   
family is big and I have 1 brother     
who goes to secondary school and 3     
smallI sisters.  My grandmother is in  
Clapham in London.  But my grandnanny  
Is still living in South Africa. It    
is hard for us to go down to the       
Mosque. The nearest Mosque is in       
Brixton, but my dad goes to Balham     
Mosque.  My dad goes on Friday and on  
Eid or when its someones wedding or    
when someone dies. We all read the     
Koran.  We Muslins do not eat with     
knives and forks. When we buy our meat,
we go somewhere special.  We buy our   
meat at Halal butchers.  I like living 
in England because we get a good       
education and good hospitals.  But I   
would like to go to S.Africa one day.
