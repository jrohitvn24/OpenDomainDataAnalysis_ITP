		<content> Around where I live, you get a lot of 
 wildlife. There are a lot of{swallows,
{martins}and{swifts.}At the moment     
 there is a{kestrel}around, I have seen
 it 3 times. In the fields behind my   
 friend's house we spotted a{water     
{vole.}On the pond where I saw the vole
 there are also{mallards,pochards}and {
{canada geese.}When my friend and I    
 went to the ponds again we found a    
 young{rabbit.}We thought it would run 
 away but it didn't, so we picked it up
 and stroked it.After a bit it jumped  
 out of my arms and ran off. At Cadeby,
 when I went fishing I saw this swallow
 diving on the water catching flies.   
 When I was down the strawberry fields 
 I spotted a pair of{yellow wagtails. }
 I have seen quite a lot of rare birds 
 where I live and my favourite is the  
 kestrel.
