   Today a friend and I went to        
 interview Mr Thomas, the history      
 teacher at the college. There are     
 about 700 pupils at the college and 60
 teachers. The college opened in 1977. 
 The staff don't use corporal          
 punishment. They punish pupils by     
 suspending them. At the college the   
 pupils have a choice of 32 subjects   
 for advanced level and 33 subjects for
 ordinary level G.C.E.                 
{Kingfield First and Middle School}    
   Mrs Flood, the headmistress, has    
 worked in the school for four years.  
 Mrs Flood particularly likes our      
 school because she finds the children 
 lively and full of ideas. As head     
 teacher Mrs Flood teaches, writes     
 reports, organises meetings and       
 timetables.
