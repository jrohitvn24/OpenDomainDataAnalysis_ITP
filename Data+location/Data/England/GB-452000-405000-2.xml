 family housing built in the 1930's but
 there are also some elderly citizen's 
 bungalows and flats, and several      
 general shops.The area is situated in 
 the V formed by the junction of two   
 major roads and has good public       
 transport.There are three schools,for 
 children from 5-8, 8-12 and 12-16.

 community is part of the{Roman Ridge. 
 This is used as a general pathway by  
 the residents but is the original line
 of the Doncaster to Castleford Roman  
 road.

 roofs and the area is known as "the   
 flat tops".                           </content>
