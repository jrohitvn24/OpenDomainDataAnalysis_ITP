		<title>20INTERVIEW WITH HEADTEACHER</title>
		<content> Mrs Baber likes  being with children  
 and people of all ages.She was a scale
 2 teacher, spending some of her time  
 acting as Deputy Head. Enjoying this, 
 she applied to Dunton Bassett School, 
 as she liked both the School and      
 village. Currently, Mrs Baber is      
 Acting Head Teacher. She likes village
 schools as she knows all the families 
 very well. The School was built in    
 1849 and extended in 1873 and 1909.   
 The Quiet Area was built in 1983 and  
 the school garden in 1984. The infants
 won Â£20 in a competition, entering a  
 picture of the village; they used the 
 money to build a pond. The School is  
 currently run by the Head, Deputy, 2  
 staff, 4 dinner ladies, p/t ancillary 
 and secretary, County Hall and        
 Governors. The School will not change,
 but teaching methods may in the future
