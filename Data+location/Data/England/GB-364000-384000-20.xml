		<title>20MY PONY</title>
		<content> My pony's name is Flash, and he is    
 nine years old.  He lives in a field  
 near the motorway.  There is a large  
 shed in the field for him to shelter  
 in.  There are two other ponies in the
 field as well.  We pay the farmer for 
 using his field.  Each day after      
 school I go to see Flash.  I have to  
 wear my gear, and my mum usually      
 drives me to the field and helps me   
 put the saddle and bridle on Flash.  I
 usually ride him in the field.  There 
 are some small fences set up and we   
 jump them.  I have to make sure Flash 
 is well looked after.  After each ride
 I give him a good brushing.  I make   
 sure he has oats and horse pellets to 
 eat and as a special treat I give him 
 an apple.  I take turns with the other
 girls in making sure the shed is      
 cleared out and there is plently of   
 clean straw for bedding.              </content>
