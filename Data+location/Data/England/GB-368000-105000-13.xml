		<title>13Buckland Newton in 1925</title>
		<content> Villagers went to Dorchester once a   
 week and had to cycle.Farmers walked  
 cows to market ,calves went by horses 
 and carts.The first car was a Lagonda 
 owned by Mr.Mitchell.The first steam  
 wagon came to Buckland Newton with    
 bricks to build Dr.Kelly's house which
 is The Rectory.The doctor lived in    
 Cerne Abbas and came in by pony or    
 foot.There were two pubs in the       
 village; "The Royal Oak" and "The New 
 Inn". Entertainment was local dances  
 and the Buckland Newton Band.Most     
 people made up their own              
 entertainment.There was a nurse and a 
 policeman in the village.Most houses  
 relied on stand pumps instead of      
 running water.Toilets weren't the     
 flush type.Tubs were used instead of a
 bathroom.Food  was cooked over a fire.
 Candles and oil lamps for light.
