		<title>10CHARLTON VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content>    The village hall was officially    
 opened in July 1981 by Earl of Suffolk
 and Berkshire, who became life        
 President of the Hall. Residents of   
 Charlton raised Â£27,000 in four years 
 to build the hall. Small proportion of
 money came in form of grants from     
 Councils and Sainsbury Trust, but     
 residents worked hard arranging fund  
 raising events such as dances, fetes  
 etc-you name it, they did it.         
    The modern building stands in 7    
 acres of Recreation Field leased from 
 Lord Suffolk a Â£1 rental per year.    
 Rents paid by organisations and hirers
 cover running costs and wages for     
 cleaner and caretaker. About four     
 annual fund raising events help pro-  
 vide extra items. Once a month "Friday
 People" get together for non- profit  
 making social event. Management con-  
 sists reps of organisations + 3 elect.</content>
