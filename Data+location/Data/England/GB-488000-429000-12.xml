     People come from all over the     
 world and stay at the castle.         
     For entertainment Mr. Frehling can
 seat 150 in the ballroom and in his   
 restaurant he can seat 85.  The Kings 
 Room will take 30.                    
     On a busy Saturday the hotel will 
 cook up to 300 meals. Mr Frehling     
 works a 12 to 18 hour day, he has a   
 night porter to help.  The Castle and 
 grounds cover 15 acres, the main uses 
 are for wedding reception and the     
 hotel.  Guests can fish in the lake   
 and ride the horses.                  
     During the second world war the   
 hotel was used as an officers' mess.  
 In 1970 it was changed into an hotel.
