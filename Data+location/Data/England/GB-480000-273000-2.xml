TO THE HIGH STREET AND INTERVIEWED     
PASSERS-BY WHO LIVE IN BROUGHTON.WE MET
FOUR DIFFERENT PEOPLE.THEY HAD LIVED

YEARS.MOST PEOPLE WERE BORN HERE AND   
ONE PERSON MOVED HERE FOR A CHANGE.THEY
SAID THEY LIKED BROUGHTON BECAUSE IT IS
COMPACT,FRIENDLY,QUIET AND HAS         
LOVELY COUNTRY-SIDE AROUND IT. ONE
