		<content>  We sent out 80 questionnaires to     
 local                                 
 households. We had 42 replies; 21 from
 owner occupiers, 20 from tennants in  
 private rented accommodation, and 1   
 from a council tennant. We found that 
 the oldest property was built in the  
 11th century. The latest was built in 
 1984. Almost all the privately rented 
 houses (14) were built before 1900.   
 Half (10) of the privately owned      
 houses had been built since 1950.     
 There were no new houses built in the 
 village between 1910 and 1950. In our 
 survey, 31 houses were detached and 10
 semi-detached. All houses have        
 electricity and inside toilets, 5 have
 bottled gas and 37 have telephones. 36
 are 2 storied, 18 have 3 bedrooms and 
 12 have 4. Many of the privately      
 rented houses are owned by the Ragley 
 Estate.                               </content>
