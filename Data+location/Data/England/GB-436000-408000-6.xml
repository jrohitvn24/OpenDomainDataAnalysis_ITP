		<content> About 25 years ago a young girl called
{Dorothy Hyman}became famous as one of 
 the fastest women sprinters in the    
 world. As she had had to train in the 
 local park, local people raised money 
 to build a{stadium}for all sports; it 
 was opened on 28 April 1973 by        
{Michael Parkinson}the TV personality  
 who also came from{Cudworth.          
                                       
 Now the stadium is run by Barnsley    
 Council and there has been added a    
 all-weather running track, squash     
 courts and social club. Outdoor sports
 played there are athletics, soccer,   
 cricket, bowls, tennis and archery;   
 indoors people can take part in weight
 training, badminton, squash, 5-a-side 
 soccer, bowls, snooker, pool and      
 darts, all of which are taken to      
 competition level.
