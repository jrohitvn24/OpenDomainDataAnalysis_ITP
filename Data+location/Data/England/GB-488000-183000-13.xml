		<content>   Typically a child might wake at     
 around seven o'clock,dress and have   
 breakfast and get ready to go to      
 school which normally begins at 0900  
 The day at school would begin with the
 register being called and then an     
 assembly in the hall taken by a       
 teacher or sometimes the children     
 themselves.The morning might be spent 
 doing some maths and english work and 
 there would be a break of fifteen     
 minutes for play.Lunch would be taken 
 between 1200 and 1315 some children   
 eating a school lunch cooked in the   
 kitchen whilst others might choose to 
 bring a packed lunch from home.The    
 afternoon session would again begin   
 with a register after which topic work
 or art and craft work would be done.at
 some point in the week the class would
 have games and also some time in the  
 hall for P.E. or drama or dance.      </content>
