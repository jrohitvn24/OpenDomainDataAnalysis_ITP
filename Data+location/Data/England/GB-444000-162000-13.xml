		<title>13Law And Order In Wash Common</title>
		<content> Our local policeman said that         
 vandalism and burglary were the crimes
 that had increased most in the last   
 ten years.In the past 20 years fraud  
 and computer crimes have developed as 
 new crimes.He said that crimes        
 involving violence worry him most.    
 He also said that very few serious    
 juvenile crimes are committed but when
 they are they are exaggerated by the  
 media and people get a wrong          
 impression.Coming to our school is one
 of his jobs and he thinks warning     
 children is a good idea.Since this was
 started childrens' crimes have gone   
 down 30%.The policeman said that      
 punishment was not a police job but up
 to the magistrate in the crown court. 
 The first police dogs used in Newbury 
 were borrowed from kennels at Wash    
 Water in our area.
