   I study birds as a hobby and these  
 are the results of a survey I did in  
 the local area. I discovered 16       
 species in the southern part of the   
 village. Sparrows, mainly house       
 sparrows, were observed in the        
 greatest numbers and like the         
 frequently seen swifts, swallows and  
 house martins,they were on and above  
 both old and new housing areas.       
 Blackbirds, song thrushes, starlings, 
 doves and pigeons were also seen      
 frequently.The gardens and hedges     
 seem to attract blue tits, great tits 
 finches,sparrows and robins. Carrion  
 crows were seen feeding near the A.1. 
 which skirts the area, whilst a       
 kestrel hovered above.                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
