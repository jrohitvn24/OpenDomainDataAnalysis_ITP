		<content>  "I have to get up at about 8:30.     
 Breakfast is toast &amp; marmite. I walk  
 about 150 m.to the Jnr. School, by    
 8:50. We play in the yard till 9:00.  
  "The first thing we do is to have an 
 assembly. We sing a hymn and hear a   
 story. In maths we work from a book,  
 Fletcher Bk.6, in my case, or Geometry
 Two. Today we have drawn circles and  
 ellipses using drawing pins and loops 
 of thread.                            
  "We have 15 min. play at 10:45. On   
 Wednesdays, a radio lesson,"Singing   
 Together" lasts 20 min. Then we may do
 Checkpoint Geography or T.V. History. 
  "I serve school dinners. Today we had
 ravioli, chips, peas &amp; carrots. Cost  
 45 pence. After lunch we read or write
 stories in "Our Books", till 2:00 when
 the bus takes us to Dronfield Sports  
 Centre for swimming. Return 3:30, home
 at 3:45."                             </content>
