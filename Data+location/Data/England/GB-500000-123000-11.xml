		<title>11LIFE STYLES - PETWORTH RURAL</title>
		<content> Most houses have at least one         
 telephone. There is a public call box 
 at Strood Green. Cordless 'phones are 
 used in some of the bigger houses -   
 these having a range of 300 yards and 
 homing in to a control box in the     
 house to give wider coverage. One     
 house with three telephones had one in
 the Jaguar car, one in the            
 home-office. Family pets are mostly   
 cats and dogs, though one had a donkey
 called Orinoco, doing nothing useful, 
 but greatly loved. The dogs are meant 
 for security, but are so glad to see  
 visitors that they are very welcoming 
 - not really doing their duty! In     
 dress everybody is casual, and all    
 classes of society wear the same. For 
 a summer day, ladies have sleeveless  
 cotton dresses, bare legs and sandals;
 men wear long trousers and shirts.
