		<title>06The Theatre: Pateley</title>
		<content>  In Pateley Bridge, there is a small  
 theatre called the Playhouse. The     
 building was originally used as a     
 chapel.The theatre is run by the local
 Dramatic Society which has one hundred
 and eighty members. Inside is a small 
 foyer where you can buy tickets. These
 cost Â£1.35p each. Beyond the foyer is 
 a room where coffee is served. Behind 
 this can be found the kitchen and     
 dressing rooms. From here, the actors 
 can reach the stage by some stairs.   
 All of the actors are amateurs. The   
 theatre has an apron stage, which     
 measures 24 feet by 18 feet. There are
 seventy three seats for the audience. 
 One person is in charge of making the 
 costumes, but most of the members help
 in some way. The sets for the plays   
 are produced by the members them-     
 selves. They try to perform at least  
 three plays each year.                </content>
