		<title>09HOUSING IN LAYER BRETON</title>
		<content> There are approximately 106 houses in 
 the area, the majority being privately
 owned, with only a small percentage of
 council owned property which is rented
 to the tenants.                       
 The houses vary considerably in size  
 and style, ranging from very small old
 cottages, some of which are situated  
 in secluded positions, to the larger  
 Georgian style houses.                
 In recent years the village has been  
 extended with the building of modern  
 properties, but further development is
 expected to be restricted.A lot of the
 older houses have been renovated but  
 retain much of their original form.   
 The general appearance of the village 
 is very pleasant, due in part to the  
 well kept gardens many of which are of
 the older 'cottage style'. The main   
 source of energy supplied to the      
 properties is electricity.            </content>
