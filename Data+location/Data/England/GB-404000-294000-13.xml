		<title>13   PIGEON-RACING</title>
		<content> My dad's hobby is pigeon-racing. He is
 in the Pheasey Club and at the end of 
 the season, if your pigeons have won  
 the most races you get a big cup. My  
 dad has fifty-five pigeons. They race 
 from Weymouth, Bath and many other    
 places. You have special clocks to    
 time the birds. When the first pigeon 
 comes back you "clock it in" and enter
 the time on a racing sheet. You have  
 to wait and see who has won because   
 there are a lot of people racing      
 pigeons. The birds have solid rings on
 their legs which tell you what year   
 they were born and which club they    
 belong to. They also have rubber rings
 which tell you where they have flown  
 from. My dad sends six birds at time  
 out racing. He sends the young ones   
 out to gain experience while resting  
 the older birds.
