		<title>11THE HINDU TEMPLE, PRESTON</title>
		<content>   Every Saturday I go to the{Gujarati 
 school in the{Temple.}When I arrive I 
 take off my shoes and go into the     
 Temple and pray to God.Then I go to a 
 table which has'prashad'on. Prashad is
 God's food.When I have eaten some of  
 it I go out of the Temple,put on my   
 shoes and line up in the hall ready   
 to say a prayer before classes begin. 
   We go to the Temple on special occa_
 sions,such as'Divali',the{Festival}Of 
 Lights.On Divali Eve we light a candle
 to burn all night in each room. Next  
 morning,we dress in our best clothes  
 and go to the Temple.We bow to the    
 statues of our Gods,leaving gifts of  
 money.We pray to be good and happy in 
 our new year.We also visit friends.   
   The rooms around the Temple are used
 as a{Community Centre}where engagement
 and wedding ceremonies are held, and  
 also for use as a Youth Club.         </content>
