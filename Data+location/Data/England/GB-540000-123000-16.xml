		<title>16SHOPPING PATTERNS</title>
		<content> Fletching High Street once boasted 12 
 shops - 2 remain. The coming of the   
 motor car, fridge and freezer means   
 that many famiilies now drive to      
 supermarkets in Uckfield,Haywards     
 Heath or Lewes, stock up fridge and   
 freezer for the week. Small country   
 food shops struggle to compete with   
 the supermarkets low prices and quick 
 turnover. Those without cars can go by
 bus either to Uckfield or Haywards    
 Heath. The bus service has been cut   
 back savagely but there is still one  
 bus in the morning to Haywards Heath  
 and one to Uckfield both doing return 
 trips in the evening. The vicar runs a
 minibus once a mouth to take          
 pensioners shopping in Eastbourne.    
 The two shops remaining are a post    
 office/general store and a butcher.
