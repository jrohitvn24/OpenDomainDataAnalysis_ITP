		<content>   Ash has four well-established Play  
 Groups for children in the 3-5 year   
 age range. They provide young children
 with opportunities to meet other boys 
 and girls and to develop their        
 manipulative skills by using building 
 bricks, Lego, jig-saw puzzles, paint  
 and plasticine. Wendy houses,         
 dressing-up clothes, sand, water and  
 dolls give material to develop through
 imaginative play.                     
   In addition to the play groups there
 are approximately 20 registered Child 
 Minders who care for children under   
 school age and also older children    
 during the school holidays.
