		<content>{Warrington-Runcorn New Town           
     Warrington New Town has been      
 developed over the past decade to     
 create a big new industrial centre,   
 which is linked to other places by the
 M6 and M62. Warrington-Runcorn has    
 proved to be successful in providing  
 housing and employment for the people 
 in the North-West.                    
    In early 1985 unemployment was     
 reduced as new businesses brought 620 
 jobs to the New Town. Achievements by 
 the New Town developers so far include
 the creation of over 23,000 jobs by   
 405 new companies.                    
    The New Town Development           
 Corporation estimate that a science   
 park now under construction will      
 create up to 3,000 jobs. It is        
 predicted that Warrington-Runcorn will
 become Britain's leader in the high   
 technology industry.                  </content>
