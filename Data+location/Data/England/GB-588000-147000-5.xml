		<title>05The Post Office</title>
		<content>   Our village shop also runs a Post   
 Office and this side of the business  
 is most important.  Pensions, Allow_  
 ances and Unemployment Benefit can all
 be collected; parcels and letters     
 posted; and Savings Bank facilities   
 used.  One of the most important      
 changes in recent years is the appear_
 ance of the Giro Bank which provides  
 people with an easy, efficient banking
 service free of charge.               
   I believe the Village Shop and Post 
 Office is more than a place of        
 commerce.  I like to think of it      
 additionally as a meeting place for a 
 friendly chat either with the staff or
 other customers.  Here is an          
 opportunity to compare notes about    
 their children, their crops, their    
 gardens or even about their husbands  
 bad habits!
