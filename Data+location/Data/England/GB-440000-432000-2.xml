		<title>02GARFORTH POLICE STATION</title>
		<content> Garforth has one{police station.}     
 There are two{cells,}one for men and  
 one for women. Each cell contains a   
 toilet, wash basin, wooden bench to   
 sleep on and a few blankets. In the   
 door is a food hatch. Before the      
{prisoners}go in, items of clothing    
 such as belts, shoes, watches and     
 chains are removed so the window can  
 not be smashed. The prisoners are only
 kept there temporarily. After that    
 they go to a proper prison. For the   
 police there is a relaxing room with a
 television and a kitchen. There is a  
 special yard where all the Police     
{transport}is kept. Approximately 6O   
 officers work at Garforth Police      
 Station. The {shifts}are 8 hours long.
 They get 35-4O calls a day. The main  
 cause of the calls is trouble with    
 neighbours and accidents. The beats   
 are balanced between cars and  foot.  </content>
