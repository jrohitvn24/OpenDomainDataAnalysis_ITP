 variety of recreational activities for
 adults.Local football team has a club 
 room in the Memorial Hall but practise
 a mile away on Reed's, the local paper
 firm's playing field.The club has     
 plans to develop an old quarry into a 
 sports ground.At the Memorial Hall    
 badminton,keepfit,discos and ballroom 
 dancing take place.The river and many 
 local ponds account for the popularity
 of fishing.The children are provided  
 with few recreational facilities.The  
 recreational ground is rarely used in 
 its present state.The Lydbrook Silver 
 Band has recently built a new club    
 house,is well supported and successful
 in competitions.Children must go to   
 the local towns or other villages to  
 find a sports centre and organisations
 such as Brownies or Cubs.Worral Hill
