		<title>05Crab fishing</title>
		<content> Six of us went to Kingswear to visit a
 fisherman and his crabbing boat.First 
 he showed us some big crabs which were
 hanging over the side in pots.He told 
 us that crabs live on the rocky bottom
 of the sea,up to 6 metres deep.Then he
 showed us his boat.We saw where they  
 cook and the bunks for sleeping.We saw
 the compass and the radar screen which
 shows the bottom of the sea.There are 
 2 radios to call for help.When the    
 boat is at sea,the crabs are left in  
 pots underwater.Then they are moved to
 large containers of sea-water,covered 
 with a metal grid,this keeps the crabs
 fresh.The fisherman sells his crabs in
 France and Spain.He took us on a trip 
 to Dartmouth Castle in the boat which 
 is 50ft long and comes from Jersey.He 
 only likes to go out in good weather. 
 He gave us two crabs to take back to  
 school which we boiled and ate.       </content>
