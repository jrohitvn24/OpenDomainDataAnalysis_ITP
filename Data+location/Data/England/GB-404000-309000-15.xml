		<title>15THE NELSON INN.1.</title>
		<content>                       Karen Worrallo. 
The landlord of the Nelson Inn is Mr.  
Rawson.The public house is in the area 
of Creswell green.The building dates   
back to the 17th century.Down the road 
from the Nelson Inn there is a cottage 
called Trafalgar Cottage.When the      
public house was first opened they     
thougt Trafalgar Inn would be a good   
name but then decided that as Lord     
Nelson had won the Battle of Trafalgar 
they would call it the Nelson Inn after
him.                                   
  The Inn is mostly built of           
brick,slates and wood.The original     
building has been extended to make it  
much larger than it was.               
  There are three areas which surround 
the public house  with a car park and a
beer garden occupying some of the land.
