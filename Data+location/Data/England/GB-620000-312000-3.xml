		<content>  The shortage of building materials   
after World War 2 lasted until the 50's
.Only the priority buildings (eg.      
police houses,essential public         
buildings) were built. The exception   
was Hawthorn Ave. where prefabricated  
homes were put up. The population of   
Hellesdon reached 6,359 in 1951 and    
E.Bush was employed in building many   
of the new houses and shops needed.    
The first post-war church in Norfolk,  
St.Pauls was built (1950) closely      
followed by the Catholic church of St. 
Boniface in that year. The new Junior  
school (now Kinsale Middle) was built  
in '51 as Heather Ave (since it opened 
in 1930) had grown to over 400 pupils. 
The 60's brought an increase in motor  
traffic, main drainage was extended to 
all of the parish and roads were made  
up.The last building surge was between 
1966 and 1977.                         </content>
