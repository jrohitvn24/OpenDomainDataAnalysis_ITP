AT HANSLOPE SCHOOL, SWEET CHESTNUT     
CLASS HAVE DONE A BUTTERFLY COUNT. WE  
LOOKED FOR BUTTERFLIES IN GARDENS,     
ALLOTENTS AND FIELDS. OUR FIRST        
BUTTERFLY COUNT WAS ON FIFTH JUNE AND  
THE WEATHER WAS CLOUDY AND DAMP.OUR    
SECOND COUNT WAS NINETEENTH JUNE AND   
IT WAS SUNNY AND WARM.THE THIRD COUNT  
WAS THE TENTH JULY AND IT WAS HOT AND  
SUNNY. THE BUTTERFLIES WE SAW MOST OF  
WERE SMALL AND LARGE WHITES SIXTY TWO  
ALLTOGETHER MOSTLY ON ALLOTMENTS       
BECAUSE THEY LIKE TO EAT THE CABBAGES  
AND VEGATABLES.WE SAW TWEWNTY SEVEN    
WALL BROWNS, NINE MEADOW BROWNS, TWO   
PEACOCKS AND ONE RED ADMIRAL. WE SAW   
MOST BUTTERFLIES ON TENTH JULY BECAUSE 
IT WAS HOTTER THAN THE OTHER DAYS AND  
MORE FLOWERS HAD GROWN SINCE THE FIRST 
COUNT.                                 
                                       </content>
