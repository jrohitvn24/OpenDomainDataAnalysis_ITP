		<title>01MOLE VALLEY BELOW REIGATE</title>
		<content> Area is based around a stretch of the 
 River Mole, flat open farming land    
 borders the river to allow for        
 flooding which can be frequent. A main
 road runs through the centre of the   
 block from north to south. There are  
 small scattered houses over most of   
 the area. The edge of a small built up
 area around another main road is      
 included in the east. The south east  
 corner inludes a new estate of houses 
 with a school. The majority of land is
 used for farming - mostly sown and    
 fertilized grassland for pasture with 
 many dairy farms in the area.
