		<title>11REDWAYS IN MILTON KEYNES</title>
		<content> Redways are paths that are made of red
 tarmac. They run round Milton Keynes  
 joining estates together. Redways are 
 mainly made for cyclists,but          
 pedestrians use them as well. I use   
 redways alot, they are very handy to  
 get to other places by bike or on     
 foot.Redways go all round Milton      
 Keynes- they take you to the          
 countryside as well as the city       
 centre. They are shown on the maps as 
 red lines. Redways play a part in     
 safety as well because they are away  
 from the busy traffic and they are    
 safe to use especially with small     
 children. Milton Keynes is famous for 
 its redways and parks; a lot of       
 redways run through the parks. Redways
 are an asset to Milton Keynes and     
 blend in well with the surroundings.
