		<title>12LIVING IN PLUMSTEAD</title>
		<content>I love living in Plumstead. It's a     
place where all the facilities you     
could ever dream of are just a bus ride
away. I like going out on my bike,     
bombing down Griffin Rd or shooting    
across the common as fast as I can. I  
haven't much of a walk to school but I 
will when I go to secondary school. All
my relatives live in this area so we   
keep in touch.                         
***************************************
Living in Plumstead it's about the same
every day. In the morning I get up at  
half past seven, get washed, get       
dressed. I start off to school at 5 to 
8. I go to school 5 days a week. When I
come home I turn the T.V. right on. I  
sit and look at the T.V. all night and 
I look at it when I'm eating my dinner.
When I tell my dad the T.V.'s on the   
blink he says it's because I always    
have it on.                            </content>
