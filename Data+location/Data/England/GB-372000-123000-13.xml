 The railway line which goes through   
 this area is the WATERLOO to          
 EXETER line. The nearest station is   
 Templecombe. The line was reopened on 
 3/10/83 after it had been closed for  
 16 years as uneconomic. The line was  
 originaly opened in 1860. The older   
 line to serve this area was the       
 Bournemouth to Bath line but in 1966  
 this line was closed down. The track  
 has been removed and the land returned
 to agriculture. The obselete track    
 travelling from East to West through  
 the Southern part of the area is that 
 of the old S &amp; D. Named for Somerset  
 and Dorset it became affectionately   
 known as the SLOW and DIRTY.
