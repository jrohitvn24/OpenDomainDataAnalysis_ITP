		<title>07The Lifestyle of the  People</title>
		<content>The people of Butley are appreciative  
of good fortune in living in peaceful  
surroundings and generally very happy  
with their lot. There are clubs and    
activities in the village for those who
want to join them, and Woodbridge      
beckons invitingly those whose sights  
are set further afield. The majority of
families have private transport of some
kind which is just as well. The post   
office stores, chapel and village      
school are now houses and it is        
proposed that the Middle School,       
equipped for over three hundred        
children will also close. The village  
people's main complaint is that there  
are too many holiday homes leading to  
a reduction of facilities for the      
local populace.
