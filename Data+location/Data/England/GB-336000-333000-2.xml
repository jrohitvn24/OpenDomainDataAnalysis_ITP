		<title>02The Canal Basin.ELLESMERE</title>
		<content> The Ellesmere canal is an interesting 
 place.There's an old warehouse which  
 is used for storing things.When it was
 first built there were arches in the  
 wall leading out to the canal,but     
 these arches are bricked up.There are 
 two doors half way up the building    
 which were used to load goods onto the
 canal boats.There is also a winch     
 above the top door.The windows are    
 louvred to stop the sun and the dirt  
 getting in.                           
 Behind the warehouse is a derelict    
 cottage and stable.The stables were   
 used to house the horses which pulled 
 the boats.The hay rack and water      
 trough still remain there.It was also 
 used by a blacksmith.                 
 An old crane still stands by the canal
 basin as a monuement to how the canal 
 was many years ago.Two years ago the  
 canal basin was tidied up.            </content>
