		<title>15Shopping Habits</title>
		<content> Recently the shopping habits of       
 Wakefield citizens have undergone     
 change due to the growth of           
 supermarkets and a hypermarket. Corner
 shops were once the focal point of    
 local communities. A survey was       
 conducted to show the effect of       
 supermarkets on local shops. Of six   
 local shope surveyed it became clear  
 that they were now used as a stop gap 
 measure. The supermarket had taken    
 over as the supplier of the weekly    
 groceries. Reasons for visiting the   
 supermarket were generally cheaper    
 prices and a variety of choice. Of 25 
 people questioned outside local shops,
 they gave reasons for using them as   
 convenient, necessity and friendly    
 service.{The days of the local shop   
{are numbered. }
