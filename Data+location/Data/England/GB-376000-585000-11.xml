		<title>11The Post Office</title>
		<content> The shop closed early this year and   
 now only a limited post office service
 remains for postage, family allowance,
 TV licenses, National Insurance       
 stamps, telephone accounts, and Nat'l 
 Savings Certificates.  The post office
 is open from 9.30-12.00 &amp; 1.30-4.00   
 daily and there is a postal collection
 every day.  The postmaster does not   
 handle as many cash transactions or do
 as much business as he did and he     
 expressed concern about attacks by    
 thieves on sub-post offices.  He has  
 to give 3 months notice of proposed   
 closure of the Post Office.  He still 
 sells long-life milk, eggs and        
 cigarettes, and he and his wife run a 
 bed and breakfast business in the     
 premises at Drove House on the Old    
 Drove Road.
