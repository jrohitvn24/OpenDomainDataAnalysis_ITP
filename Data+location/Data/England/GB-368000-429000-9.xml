		<title>09VIDEO DISCS 2 - BLACKBURN</title>
		<content>When the master has been produced it   
can be used in the next stage of disc  
making. A nickle Stamper is made from  
the Master and if the Stamper is found 
to be perfect then the Stamper will be 
used to make thousands of discs in the 
Replicating process. The final disc is 
made from plastic granules which are   
melted at a temperature of 175C and    
then injected into a disc shape. The   
Stamper is then pressed into the       
plastic at a force of 200 tons. The    
discs are made in two halves and a     
silver solution is sprayed on to each  
half before they are stuck together.   
The disc is then cut to the correct    
size to ensure that it fits neatly     
into the disc player. All the discs are
tested to a high standard. Finally the 
discs are labelled and packed before   
being dispatched to the customer.
