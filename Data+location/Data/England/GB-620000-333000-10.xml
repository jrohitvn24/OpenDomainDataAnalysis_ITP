		<title>10Religion In Gunton Area</title>
		<content> Although the area has three churches  
only one of these is used regularly.   
Hanworth Church has 2 services a month.
It is part of a combined parish of     
several villages. Alby Church,dedicated
to st. Ethelbert, has been disused     
since 1984. Parishioners join the      
village of Twaite for worship. Both    
these churches are of flint and tile.  
Gunton chapel was declared redundant   
in 1980 but was not deconsecrated and  
is used for special services. It was   
designed by Robert Adam in 1769, and   
appears as a classical temple. It has  
a magnificent moulded ceiling. In times
past it was attended by estate workers 
but when tied cottages became empty    
with the change in agricultural methods
the "flock"dwindled. Now that the      
cottages are owner-occupied and the    
Hall converted to many units the chapel
may be re-commissioned.                </content>
