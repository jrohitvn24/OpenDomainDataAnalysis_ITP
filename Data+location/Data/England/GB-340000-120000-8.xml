		<title>08Cider Farm.Kingsbury.</title>
		<content> The Kingsbury area is famous for its  
 fine cider apples.Today we walked up  
 to the cider farm on the southern     
 slope of Burrow Hill. First we were   
 taken around some of the eight        
 orchards.There are over thirty        
 different kinds of trees and over 4000
 trees.We saw Dabinett,Tremletts,      
 Bulmer's Norman and Foxwhelp. Pests   
 such as aphids are controlled by a    
 minimum of spraying.We saw how cider  
 apple shoots were being grafted onto  
 the boughs of Worcester stock at about
 a height of two metres.A central tall 
 shoot with foliage on had been left on
 the original tree as a perch for birds
 to try to prevent them from damaging  
 the graftings.The apples are picked up
 from under the trees from October     
 onwards.In recent years the local     
 school children have been sponsored to
 do this,for school funds.             </content>
