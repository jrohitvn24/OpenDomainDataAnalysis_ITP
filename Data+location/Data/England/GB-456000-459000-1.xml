		<content> The area lies almost 4 miles due north
 of York, between the villages of      
 Shipton and Wigginton.It is a rural   
 area. The land is mainly used for     
 farming,a mixture of arable and       
 stock.The land is low-lying,with no   
 raised ground. Several ditches cross  
 the area. Some have been dug out and  
 widened, for drainage.Most are very   
 overgrown,with shrubs and small trees 
 filling them.Much of the area was very
 wet underfoot, the result of heavy    
 rainfall during the summer.           
 Area is divided into thirds by two    
 roads running south-east to           
 north-west,the B1363 from York to     
 Helmsley, and a country road from     
 Skelton which eventually peters out   
 into an untarred road north of the    
 area, into a district koown as        
 Bohemia.Electricity pylons cross the  
 area.                                 </content>
