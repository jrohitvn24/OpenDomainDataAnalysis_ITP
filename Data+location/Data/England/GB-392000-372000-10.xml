		<title>10CANAL TRAFFIC</title>
		<content> With the completion of the Cheshire   
 Ring, traffic has increased to up to  
 100 boats weekly in Summer. Weekly    
 hire of a typical 4-berth boat is     
 upwards of Â£250 including fuel.  We   
 talked to two American families from  
 Kentucky having a new kind of holiday 
 . They were surprised at the work     
 involved, finding the holiday fun but 
 "all rain and locks! " A Warrington   
 family found a canal holiday ideal for
 children who liked to get dirty and   
 "Mess about". Shopping was generally  
 done in small towns along the canal.  
 With a fourth family, the canal was   
 their home.  They liked the freedom   
 and being able to "Move the house".   
 The Buxton Road Marina has diesel fuel
 and toilet emptying facilities. They  
 also do repair and maintenance, have  
 76 water moorings, 20 dry berths and  
 house canoes of a Scout group.        </content>
