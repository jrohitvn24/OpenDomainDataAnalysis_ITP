		<content> Over the past two decades, as the     
 population of the village has grown   
 significantly, the need for some sort 
 of community building has become      
 evident. Recently groups of interested
 villagers have got together in an     
 attempt to motivate enthusiasm and    
 investigate the possibility of getting
 a Community Hall.On Friday April 26th 
 1985{the Yealmpton Community Assoc.   
 celebrated it's inauguration with a   
 dinner at the W.I.Hall.The Association
 was formed to research, fund and      
 organise the building of a community  
 hall. This will be long project and   
 the first two major tasks are fund    
 raising and selection of a viable site
