		<content>Quite a few people go fishing in the   
River Hamps and jogging is popular as  
lanes are quiet and traffic free.      
Walking is also popular because of the 
nature of the countryside and good     
access to footpaths. In some villages  
there are football teams and like the  
pubs' darts teams, these take part in  
local leagues. Bird watching and       
nature conservation are also enjoyed   
and  Swineholes Wood is a nature       
reserve  where nesting sites and       
management schemes encourage wild      
life. Elsewhere in the area, some of   
the unimproved  rough pastures and old 
quarry spoil heaps have been designated
S.S.I.'s (Sites of Scientific Interest)
because of their isolation and freedom 
from pesticides. Special facilities for
evening classes, Bingo sessions, Youth 
Club, Swimming Club and Badminton are  
available at Waterhouses Middle School.</content>
