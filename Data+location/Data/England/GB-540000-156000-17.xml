		<content>                                       
There are over 30 clubs in Biggin Hill 
for both boys and girls. There are some
places which have activities such as   
brownies, girl guides, judo, boxing,   
scouts, disco, and many more. At most  
clubs you have to be a certain age to  
go. There are also clubs for Mums and  
Dads and some for over 60's. The school
here has many activities. It is a good 
place for children to live because it  
is a lively place. Again at the school 
there are lots of music clubs. Some    
of them are at lunchtime and some are  
during the lessons. There is also the  
Spitfire Club which offers lots of     
activities but mostly for older        
children, except for Sunday School.
