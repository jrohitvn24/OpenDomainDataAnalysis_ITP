		<title>03Research in Harpenden</title>
		<content> Rothamsted Experimental Station was   
 founded in 1843 by Sir John Bennet    
 Lawes.   It is the oldest Experimental
 Station in England.   It employs 700  
 people many of whom live in Harpenden.
                                       
 The main aim of the station is to get 
 the best yield from crops and the     
 scientists experiment with soils,     
 fertilisers, crop varieties and water.
 Insects and crop pests are examined   
 too to see if they have any good uses 
 for man.   Bees too are studied to see
 if honey yield may be increased.      
 Students from all over the world come 
 to observe and learn from the work    
 going on in Harpenden.                
                                       
 One field, Broadbalk has not been     
 touched for 100 years, it shows what  
 Harpenden must have been like before  
 it was settled.                       </content>
