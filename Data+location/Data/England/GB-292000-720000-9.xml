		<title>09TRANSPORT IN MADDERTY</title>
		<content> There is a lack of public transport in
 Madderty.  One bus makes two journeys 
 a day from Crieff to Perth via        
 Madderty, once in the morning and once
 in the evening.   Anyone travelling   
 into Perth on the morning bus has to  
 wait until tea time before they       
 can make the return journey.          
 There is a school contract bus which  
 takes pupils into the Secondary School
 in Crieff on which members of the     
 public can travel.  Again they cannot 
 return until four o'clock when the    
 pupils return.   Any pupils wishing to
 attend clubs or sports after school   
 have to be collected by their         
 parents,as there is no other service  
 bus.   A car is therefore essential   
 here.  Older people without a car have
 to rely on the goodwill of neighbours.
