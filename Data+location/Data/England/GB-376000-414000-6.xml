		<title>06EMPLOYMENT IN RAMSBOTTOM</title>
		<content> Most of the people who live in        
 Ramsbottom tend to work in Ramsbottom.
 They are mainly{skilled and           
{semi-skilled workers.}There are many  
 large factories e.g. T.N.T. an        
 international haulage company, Cormar 
 Carpets, F.D. Sims a wire works and   
 Trinity Paper Mill to mention but a   
 few.                                  
  Most{travel to work}on foot or by    
 bicycle as they live close by.        
 Ramsbottom does not experience a large
 movement of traffic in the mornings or
 evenings because of the large local   
 element of its work force.            
  Ramsbottom does not have a large     
{unemployment}problem as she has never 
 solely relied on old heavy industry,  
 as have other Northern towns which are
 now suffering due to their total      
 reliance on such. {Paper} is the main 
 single product of the town.           </content>
