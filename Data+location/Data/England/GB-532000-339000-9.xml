		<content>      The PILGRIM FATHERS MEMORIAL     
                                       
 In the eastern section of the area    
 along the bank of the River Witham    
 there is a memorial to the original   
 pilgrim fathers who vainly attempted  
 to leave Boston for religious freedom 
 in Holland.                           
   In 1607 a group of puritans from    
 the north of the county near          
 Gainsborough led by  William Brewster 
 William Bradford and John Robinson    
 walked all the  way to Boston to      
 escape religious persecution .They    
 had arranged  with the captain of a   
 ship to take them from Boston to the  
 netherlands where  they would  be free
 to worship as they wished.They had    
 arranged to board the ship south of   
 Boston so as to be safe from the      
 authorities.
