		<content> I got up at 8.30pm and got dressed    
 quickly to go to the park.I did not   
 bother having breakfast.When we got   
 there I took off my shoes,socks,tee_  
 shirt and pants.I had my shorts on    
 underneath.I got in the Big Park pond.
 There are some tadpoles,jacksharks and
 frogs in there.The water was freezing 
 cold.My dog,Snoopy and I played in the
 pond for half an hour.I dried myself  
 and we walked home.I made some banana 
 flavour milk shake and put two ice    
 cubes in it.I had bacon butties for   
 dinner.In the afternoon I went        
 collecting golf balls.I can get Â£2 for
 ten balls if I sell them at the golf  
 course or Â£1.50 if my dad sells them  
 at work for me.I found four.The most I
 ever found in one day was seven.I came
 home for tea,king ribs, and went out  
 to play football with my friends till 
 8o'clock.                             </content>
