		<content>     I am a 12 years old girl pupil at 
 St Michael's C.E. F/M School. I wear  
 a school uniform which is grey and    
 maroon.  In winter it consists of a   
 grey skirt and a white blouse with a  
 grey or maroon jumper or cardigan and 
 in summer a checked or striped dress. 
    Each day at school we have a       
 religious assembly, mathematics and   
 some form of English lesson.  Other   
 subjects studied at different times in
 the week are Art and Craft, Science,  
 French, Music, Religious Education,   
 History, Geography and Physical       
 Education.                            
    We have many special events like   
 plays, concerts, sports days and      
 discoes. Particularly interesting have
 been School Journeys to London, Whitby
 and Northumberland, areas we have been
 studying at school. Each School       
 Journey provides a term's work.       </content>
