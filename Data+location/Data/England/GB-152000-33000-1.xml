 rural landscape which is dominated by 
 dairy and arable and some sheep       
 farming. The area reaches Hayle on the
 Atlantic coast in the North East,to   
 North West lies Trencrom Hill (a      
 granite outcrop now owned by the      
 National Trust).To the South the area 
 is little populated except for a      
 number of farms.

 lying adjacent to the main A30 road   
 that runs through the county of       
 Cornwall,is St Erth station.
