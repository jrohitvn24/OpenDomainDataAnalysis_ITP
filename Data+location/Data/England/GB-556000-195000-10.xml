		<title>10PILGRIMS HATCH</title>
		<content> 82% of the population in Pilgrims     
 Hatch enjoy living there because it is
 near to the countryside and Brentwood.
 It is near the shopping centres of    
 Harlow,Basildon,Romford and Chelmsford
 which can only be reached by          
 car.Pilgrims Hatch doesn't have many  
 facilities for young people e.g.discos
 and youth clubs .There is no          
 doctor,dentist or chemist.There are   
 many complaints to the council about  
 the lack of repairs on the council    
 houses.The bus service is poor for    
 some areas and the fares are too      
 high.e.g.38p to Brentwood from the    
 centre of Pilgrims Hatch.There are too
 few evening and weekend buses.many    
 people enjoy using the local squash   
 courts and swimming pool.Old people   
 think that prices at local shops are  
 too high.
