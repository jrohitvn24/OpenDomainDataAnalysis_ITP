		<content>      Today is Sunday so I stayed in   
 bed till eleven o'clock. I then       
 discovered that we were having dinner 
 early so we could spend more time     
 walking in the afternoon and I had    
 nearly missed it!                     
 After dinner we walked down to the    
 railway station and had a look at the 
{train}comemmorating one hundred and   
 fifty years of G.W.R. (Great Western  
 Railways). Inside the{train}there was 
 an exibition of information on the    
 G.W.R.                                
 We then walked to{Newlyn}and and had a
 look at the open day at the lifeboat  
 station. At the open day they had the 
 local crime prevention car which told 
 you to get out if you sat in it.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
