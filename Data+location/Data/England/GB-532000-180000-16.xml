		<content>  Roger Edwards:- One of the most      
popular pastimes in East London is     
fishing along the canals and in the    
Limehouse Basin. There is still a      
strong interest in the traditional     
sport of Boxing, with major events at  
York Hall, Bethnal Green.              
  Quite a few people go to the Wapping 
Sports Centre, opened in 1981. Office  
workers use it in their lunch hours.   
Women in particular use the Sauna and  
Solarium.                              
  A new sports and leisure centre at   
Aldgate called the Sedgewick Centre has
just opened to the public, though its  
main use is for employees in the       
adjacent Sedgewick House.              
  There is also a new leisure centre   
being built by the London Docklands    
Development Corporation on the Isle of 
Dogs both for local residents and for  
workers in the Enterprise Zone.        </content>
