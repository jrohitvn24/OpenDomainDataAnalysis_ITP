I like to play Â£Hot Potato or          
Fireball'. You need a ball &amp; at least  
four people to play. You all stand in  
a circle facing the centre. You have   
to throw the ball to the next person   
as soon as you catch it, because it is 
supposed to be hot. You carry on       
throwing the ball round the circle     
until someone drops it. They have to   
run around the circle while the next   
person gets the ball. When that person 
has got the ball they throw it to the  
next person as fast as they can. When  
the ball gets to the person next to    
the one that dropped the ball, they    
stump the place &amp; that person has to   
sit in the middle of the circle. If    
that person is already in his place    
the game just carries on. It is best to
play this game in an open space.
