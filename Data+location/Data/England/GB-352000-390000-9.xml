		<content>     We went to one of the fifteen     
 farms in our block.  It is called     
 Northfield Farm.  The farm has 86     
 acres. The land is used partly for    
 growing hay for the horses and partly 
 for grazing.                          
     There are 45 horses on the farm.  
 The biggest horse measuring 17.2      
 hands.                                
     The farm has 12 workers on it.    
 They have the following machines on   
 the farm:- tractors, rotavators and   
 baler.                                
     They only send manure to market.  
 There is a riding school at Northfield
 Farm.                                 
     Maypole Farm is 70 acres and the  
 land is used for barley, potatoes, hay
 and oats.  They have cattle on the    
 farm.  The Corn Merchant comes to     
 collect corn and they take the cattle 
 to market.                            </content>
