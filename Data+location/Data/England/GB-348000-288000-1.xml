		<content> This block includes Ape Dale beyond   
 Eaton brook. Wenlock Edge, Hope Dale &amp;
 Little London Hill which is part of   
 View Edge. The population is widely   
 scattered. Ticklerton, Middlehope and 
 Harton are little more than two       
 neighbouring farmsteads. Eaton itself 
 now consists of a church, an ex-      
 rectory and a large farmstead. Farming
 is the major occupation, and includes 
 dairying &amp; intensive poultry down in  
 Ape Dale, sheep &amp; beef cattle in Hope 
 Dale, &amp; much more cereal &amp; fodder     
 crops growing around the View Edge.   
 The large area of woodland on the     
 steep (scarp) slope of Wenlock Edge is
 mainly deciduous but also includes    
 Christmas tree production. Lillichope 
 Estate commercial woodlands extend to 
 several hundred acres on the highest  
 land around Upper Lillichope.
