		<content> Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, 
 you are now entering Lillington - and 
 you're welcome to it! This place is   
 really boring! We used to have real   
 fun on a Saturday night, smashing up  
 the Mason Avenue bus shelter, but they
 took it away last week - in a paper   
 bag! Breaking the wings off the angels
 in the graveyard was good too, but we 
 ran out of angels and no-one buys posh
 graves any more,- I wonder why?       
 I smashed a blokes face in yesterday  
 for writing "MUFC" on the shopping    
 centre wall,-then I sprayed "COV. CITY
 RULES"over the top,well you don't want
 rubbish like that on walls, do you? We
 were going down the town tonight to   
 start a fight, but I'll have to stay  
 at home 'cos some rotten, anti-social,
 selfish hooligan's just set fire to me
 car! Somebody call a policeman-there's
 never one round when you need one!    </content>
