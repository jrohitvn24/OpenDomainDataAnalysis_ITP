		<content>   There are usually several games of  
{football}going on in the playground at
 the same time so it is very hard to   
 play your own game.You get your       
 footballs muddled so you have to make 
 up your own rules.If you are in{goal} 
 you{throw}the ball instead of{kicking 
 it out of your hand.If someone who is 
 playing another game{blocks}the ball  
 we have to decide if it is a{penalty} 
 or not.                               
{ Moving Targets}is a game for a group 
 of people.You stand next to a{wall}and
{dodge}a{ball}thrown at you.If you get 
 hit it's your turn to throw the ball. 
 You can use spongeballs,tennisballs   
 and footballs.You can play it in the  
 winter with softly packed{snowballs}. 
 You can play it inside or out. You can
 play it on a bench. You can play it   
 standing next to a piece of wood,     
 which is dangerous.                   </content>
