		<title>13REDHILL TOWN</title>
		<content> We live in an area with low           
 unemployment. {Gatwick Airport}is near
 supplying jobs for many people.  In   
 Redhill many new offices have been    
 built as well as many other buildings 
 to make the area better and more      
 enjoyable for people to live in.  A   
 new sports centre has been built      
 providing facilities for swimming,    
 squash, weight training etc.  The new{
{QUADRANT SHOPPING CENTRE}will also    
 make shopping quicker, easier and     
 safer.  However many buildings have   
 disappeared to make way for the new   
 developments, cinemas are now very    
 rare in our area.  They were very     
 popular with families but they have   
 lost out to home video.  We have many 
 schools in our area though some have  
 merged together to save money.  Many  
 young people go into the town for     
 entertainment some do breakdancing.   </content>
