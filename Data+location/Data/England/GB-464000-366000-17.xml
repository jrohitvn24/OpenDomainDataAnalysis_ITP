		<title>17St.Joseph's Convent,Boughton</title>
		<content>      Some children from Forest View   
 Junior School, Ollerton visited the   
 above convent in June, 1985.          
      They were met by Sister Mary, who
 is in charge. She said that the       
 convent was 25 years old, having      
 previously been the Manor House.Sister
 Mary enjoyed living in{Boughton,      
 mainly because of the surrounding     
 countryside and the peace and quiet.  
      Next,she took the group around   
 the convent, showing them the         
 visitors' room and dining room. In the
 latter was a huge table, from which   
 the nuns eat, and a wall tapestry     
 showing the crucifixion. The next room
 was the pantry, where two meat hooks  
 still hung from the ceiling.          
      After showing the group the      
 all-yellow prayer room it was time to 
 go.As a farewell gift Sister Mary     
 gave each child a choc-ice. By D.Toms.</content>
