		<content> In 1926 the railway line was opened,  
 originally for passenger use and the  
 odd freight came from Southampton or  
 Esso Refinery. The passenger service  
 did not last long because not many    
 people used the train. Eventually it  
 closed to passengers but the freight  
 still carries on. Trains run quite    
 frequently through picturesque scenes.
 The majority of the freight trains are
 tankers full of petrol ready to be    
 taken away. The locomotives used on   
 the line are either class 33's or     
 47's. The trains run about five times 
 a day. First they set out from Esso,  
 through a long cutting, across the    
 level crossing, through an embankment 
 and under the road bridge at Jones    
 Lane. At Hythe the railway crossing   
 man has got to open the gates when the
 trains come. He lives in the house    
 next to the railway.                  </content>
