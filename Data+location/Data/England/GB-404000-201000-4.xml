		<title>04TYPES OF HOMES IN AMPNEY</title>
		<content>  In{Ampney Crucis}most people own     
 their own houses. The{Cotswold        
{District Council}lets 45 houses. 3    
 houses are let privately to students. 
 There are 3 tied houses. 4 houses     
 continue to be let by Woodminster to  
 old retainers of the Cripps family. 65
 houses were built before 1939. 94     
 houses are post-war. There are 15     
 conversions of old buildings into     
 homes. The price of houses is high,   
 Â£65,000 being asked for               
 a semi-detached cottage. Houses sell  
 quickly. Almost all the old houses are
 built of dressed or rubble{Cotswold   
{stone, a}few have brick additions. The
 new houses are of reconstituted stone.
 The few houses around the farms are   
 used by families, tied or let to      
 students.
