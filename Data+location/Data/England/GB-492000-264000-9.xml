		<content>Rushden Hall is one of several interest
-ing buildings in the area.Nowadays it 
is used as council offices but it was  
once a home.There has possibly been a  
house on the site since before the     
Conquerer's time.Certainly in 1298 a   
house was owned there by Edmund,Duke of
Lancaster,possibly a hunting lodge.The 
Pemberton family owned the hall from   
1460 to 1639.The main part of the house
was constructed in local limestone dur-
ing the 17th century. The dining room  
is special because of its oak panelling
which has various designs of people    
eating.The drawing room has got a stain
ed glass window.From the windows at the
front you can look out over the park to
the bandstand where various bands still
play on summer Sundays.The Hall gardens
are delightful,there are many types of 
trees and flowers.The old kitchen      
garden is now a Garden Centre.         </content>
