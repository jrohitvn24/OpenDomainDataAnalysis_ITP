		<title>16Farming _ Milk production.</title>
		<content> Mr.C is the cowman and dairyman on a  
 large farm specialising in milk       
 production. He is responsible for the 
 well_being of 110 milking cows, 30    
 young heifers and 2 bulls. Apart from 
 one bull which is a Hereford pedigree 
 all the stock are Friesians. On       
 average each milking cow produces over
 24 litres of milk per day. They are   
 milked twice a day at 0630 and 1530h. 
 Each cows diet is supplemented with   
 'cake', small pieces of specially     
 compounded food stuffs. Mrs.C keeps   
 accurate records of each cows total   
 performance.                          
 Some of the cows fetch about Â£1000    
 when auctioned in the market.         
 Each animal is regularly tested to    
 ensure that it is free of tuberculosis
 and brucelosis.
