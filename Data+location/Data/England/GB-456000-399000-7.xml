		<title>07DONCASTER'S LEISURE PLANS</title>
		<content> Recreation will be something very     
 special in Doncaster in the future.   
 Despite much opposition the Council is
 going ahead with its plans for a      
 multi-million Â£ leisure complex on the
 carr land to the south of the town.   
   It will consist of: indoor and      
 outdoor heated swimming pools, sports 
 halls, restaurants,bowls hall,        
 badminton,tennis and squash courts,   
 martial arts area, ski-slopes,        
 climbing walls,go-cart track, golf    
 driving range, nature walks and 60    
 acres of artificial lake for water    
 sports. All this should be ready for  
 the 1990s.                            
   Opposition comes mainly from        
 Doncaster Airport Club who will lose  
 its runway. In its favour the centre  
 would provide much employment and give
 Doncaster a development of national   
 importance.                           </content>
