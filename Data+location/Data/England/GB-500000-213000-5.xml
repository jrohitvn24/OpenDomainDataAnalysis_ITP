 of the Chilternsthe area is clay with 
 flints on chalk. A 126 acre woodland  
 site of Special Scientific Interest   
 lies within this area of outstanding  
 natural beauty.The high environmental 
 quality of the area and easy access to
 the M1, Luton, Dunstable and the towns
 of north-west Hertfordshire attract   
 the retired and high income commuters.
 The area is mainly agricultural with  
 woods and commonland. Studham,        
 Bedfordshire's southernmost village,  
 is the largest in the block. Dunstable
 Road runs between terraced brick      
 houses, numbers 5-9 being a           
 conservation area. The two shops are  
 over 100 years old, the Post Office   
 was originally the village bakery. To 
 comply with Local Planning Authority  
 aims, new houses are screened by      
 trees.                                </content>
