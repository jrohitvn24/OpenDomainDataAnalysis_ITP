   Owston Harvest Festival is a big    
 party for the villagers who, together 
 with friends and relations from       
 outside, all sit down together for    
 Harvest Supper after the special      
 church serice. Cold meat,salad and    
 apple pie are prepared and served by  
 the ladies and, following the meal,   
 all the produce from the church is    
 auctioned for funds.                  
  On the 5th November, Owston holds a  
 Guy Fawkes party with a large  bonfire
 outside the Village Hall. Fireworks   
 are lit, refreshments contributed by  
 everyone and mulled wine handed round.
  After the carol service at Christmas 
 the congregation has a party with     
 mulled wine and mince pies.           
  Three gardens open under the National
 Gardens Scheme in summer.             </content>
