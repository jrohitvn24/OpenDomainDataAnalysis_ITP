		<title>10Newcomer to Hanley Swan</title>
		<content> Mr Norris wanted to live in the       
 country  but close to a school for his
 children, and with good communications
 for his business. He lives in a large 
 house part of which he uses for his   
 business. Today many small companies  
 are run from homes, like his computer 
 company. Visiting people can find     
 Hanley Swan easily,it's on a B road   
 and only a few turnings from the      
 motorway. A disadvantage is it has no 
 regular bus service to connect with   
 the nearest town railway. The Postal  
 service is adequate, and having a     
 village P.O.he can make use of its    
 banking facilities. Local carrier     
 firms are vital to him in transporting
 his computers. His family enjoy living
 in Hanley Swan, because they can go   
 for country walks, join in horse      
 riding and reach other activities     
 they like.                            </content>
