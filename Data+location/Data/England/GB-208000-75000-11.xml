		<content>{ST.BREWARD CHURCH}IS PROBABLY THE     
{HIGHEST CHURCH}IN CORNWALL.IT WAS     
 FOUNDED BY A PERSON CALLED ST.BRUERE  
 IN 1189,1189 WAS THE TIME THEY STARTED
 BUILDING BUT THEY DID'NT FINISH UNTIL 
 ABOUT 1205.THE NORTH AISLE WAS BUILT  
 FIRST AND THE SECOND AISLE WAS ADDED  
 IN THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY.THERE IS A  
 PEW CALLED THE HAMATETHY PEW,THE FRONT
 OF WHICH WAS MADE OF OAK AND OAK MADE 
 A GOOD MATERIAL TO SHARPEN SWORDS     
 ON.DURING THE CIVIL WAR SOME SOLDIERS 
 HELPED TO PROVE THE THEORY BY GOING   
 INTO THE CHURCH AT NIGHT AND SLASHING 
 THEIR SWORDS AT IT AND WRECKED        
 IT.SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT ST.BRUERE   
 WAS BURIED UNDER SOME STONES IN THE   
 CHURCH BUT OTHERS DO NOT REALLY       
 BELIEVE IT.
