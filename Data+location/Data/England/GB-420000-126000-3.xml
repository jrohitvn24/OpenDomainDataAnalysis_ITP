		<title>03HOUSING BUTTERFURLONG</title>
		<content>  The Hewetts and the Marshalls houses 
 are joined together all across except 
 for a square courtyard in the         
 middle,which  has a pump in.The pump  
 is the same age as the houses.A lady  
 died in the well beneath the pump in  
 the 1930s but it is not known  whether
 she fell,was pushed down  or committed
 suicide.Butterfurlong Cottages and    
 Farm are pleasantly situated near West
 Grimstead.Someway up a nearby track is
 a pig farm.It is on three sides       
 surrounded by fields and one side by  
 woods.Both cottages are  thought to be
 about 150 years old.They used to be a 
 tied cottage for Butterfurlong Farm.In
 1965 the cottages were                
 remodernized.The Marshalls and        
 the Hewetts  gardens both cover       
 approximately one fifth of an         
 acre.Both houses are made of brick and
 both roofs are clay tiles.            </content>
