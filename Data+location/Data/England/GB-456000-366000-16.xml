		<title>16Warsop Pigeon Clubs.</title>
		<content>  There are 2 Pigeon Clubs in Warsop,  
 one meeting midweek and the other on  
 Saturdays.We interviewed one member.  
 His 26 pigeons are worth about Â£20    
 each but he has heard of a pigeon     
 fetching Â£27,500!                     
  He feeds his pigeons with mixed corn,
 3 times a day.His heaviest bird weighs
 0.72 kg.                              
  When training a pigeon it is taken a 
 short distance from home and released 
 to find its way back,the distance then
 being gradually increased.            
  His pigeons have raced from a        
 distance of 481 miles,their average   
 speed being around 30 mph.They are    
 carried to the starting point by      
 transporter and then released.Their   
 homing instinct brings them back to   
 Warsop.
