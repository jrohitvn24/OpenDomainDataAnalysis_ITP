		<title>10SELSEY REST HOMES PT.1</title>
		<content>    Many of the{larger houses}in Selsey
 are being{converted}into{Rest homes   
 for the elderly.Some of our class     
 visited one which was about 400 years 
 old. They found out that it takes 11  
 residents aged between 74 and 94.Some 
 of these are locals and some are from 
 the London area.All of the residents  
 are{permanent,}they have their{own    
{bedroom}and they can bring in their   
 own furniture,television and personal 
 possessions but no pets.They are      
 mostly ladies.The owner tries to give 
 the residents as much freedom as      
 possible.They pay{Â£90}and upwards a   
 week.None of the{staff}has to have    
 qualifications.The owner is like your 
 own Mum but she has to buy more food.
