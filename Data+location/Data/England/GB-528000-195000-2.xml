		<title>02Population in West Enfield</title>
		<content>  Most of the people surveyed were born
 in the British Isles but a large      
 minority were born in Cyprus.The      
 majority of people had moved two or   
 three times before settling here and  
 some had made several moves.In many   
 cases people born in the U.K had also 
 lived in other countries.             
  The majority chose to live in this   
 area because it is pleasant,leafy     
 suburb with good schools,attractive   
 houses and large areas of open        
 space.It is  convenient to both town  
 and country with excellent bus,train  
 and underground links with London.Many
 people already had friends or family  
 in the area.                          
  The population is mobile with        
 the majority having lived here for ten
 years or less but many expect to      
 remain in the area for at least ten   
 years and some plan to retire here.   </content>
