		<content> Dairy farming is most important to the
 economy of the area and even farms    
 that do not have a dairy herd often   
 keep two or three cows that provide   
 the family with milk butter and       
 clotted cream although the regulations
 on 'untreated' milk products are being
 tightened this autumn - not a very    
 popular restriction. Apart from dairy 
 cows, rearing of store cattle, sheep, 
 pigs and poultry are all undertaken   
 and there is even a small breeding    
 herd of deer on one of the farms.     
 There is a veterinary surgeon with a  
 practice in the block who is able to  
 undertake the care of animals on the  
 surrounding farms. Animals can be     
 grazed out in the fields for most of  
 the year but cattle are often housed  
 in the winter and sheep, particularly 
 around lambing are brought indoors.   
 Animals are sold at local markets.    </content>
