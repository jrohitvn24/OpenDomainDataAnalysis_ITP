		<content> We walked from Whitcott Evan weir     
 (depth 1.3m)to Clun Bridge tallying   
 trees.                                
 Altogether we walked approx. 3km. The 
 trees we saw were: alder 1500,        
 blackthorn 20, hazel 1, hawthorn 98,  
 sycamore 3, willow 82, oak 3, ash 25. 
 We compiled a list of fauna which we  
 saw ourselves or have been told of by 
 other people, such as farmers.        
 Mammals:water vole, water rat, otter  
 and shrew.                            
 Birds: kingfisher, heron, dipper, grey
 wagtail, pied wagtail and mallard     
 duck.                                 
 In Clun, the River Clun is spanned by 
 a 14th century bridge. We carried out 
 a traffic survey to see how much this 
 bridge is used.In one hour, at mid-day
 the bridge was crossed by: 87 motor   
 cars, 21 vans, 8 lorries, 3 cyclists, 
 11 other vehicles &amp; 60 pedestrians.   </content>
