		<title>01Farming around Longdon</title>
		<content>   About half the area is used as{rough
{grazing}or{permanent pasture}for{ beef
{cattle }and {sheep.}There is one{dairy
 farm, a{pig}farm  and a{poultry} farm.
 The  farmers  make  hay  once  a year.
 On  the  remaining  land {cereal crops
 are grown and there are the occasional
 fields of{peas}and nowadays{rape-seed.
                                       
   Since{Longdon Marsh}has been drained
 the area is cropped in  summer, though
 it  always  floods in  winter when the
 Severn  is  high.  The  land usage has
 changed  over  the  last  twenty years
 from  predominantly  rough  grazing to
 more arable farming.                  
   This  has  led  to a decrease in the
{wild-life.  }The  otters  which   once
 lived  on  Longdon  Marsh   have   now
 disappeared  to  the disappointment of
 the local residents. {
