		<title>05DENTON'S TRUST HOMES</title>
		<content> Mr Denton's firm has built a large    
 part of Highburton. We looked at the  
 1967 Ordnance Survey map of Highburton
 and found that most of the village was
 fields. Denton's have been building   
 houses for the last 16 years. They    
 have built over 500 houses in the     
 village. It takes Denton's about 4    
 months to build a house, depending on 
 the weather. They build all sorts of  
 houses, bungalows, detached, semi-    
 detached and terraced. Mr Denton has  
 got no more planning permission in    
 Highburton, but he has got it for some
 houses on Penistone Road, Shelley.The 
 most expensive house he has built cost
 Â£75,000. It even had gold bath taps!  
 Mr Denton has never built anything    
 else except houses. He uses artificial
 stone to build with so that it looks  
 like the older houses in the village.
