		<title>15     CHILDREN'S HOBBIES</title>
		<content> In the year 1985 children and         
 teenagers often occupy themselves by  
 going cycling. Others go to swimming  
 lessons and girls often go to         
 synchronised swimming lessons. Lots of
 girls go to Rangers, Guides or        
 Brownies and boys go to Boys Brigade, 
 Cubs or Scouts. Children during this  
 year are interested in{sport.}Teachers
 stay behind and give those who are    
 most interested extra lessons during  
 lunch plays and certain days after    
 school. Girls can go to rounders and  
 netball and boys can go to cricket and
 football. Gymnastics, tennis, running,
 badminton, chess, music and drama are 
 all popular at our school. Another    
 popular{hobby}is dancing, many girls  
 learn classical dancing, and sometimes
 even boys will go to disco dancing.   
 Many children go horse riding.
