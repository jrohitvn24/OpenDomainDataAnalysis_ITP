		<title>17HISTORY OF ALKHAM CHURCH.</title>
		<content> During the Danish invasion a small    
 temple was constructed and following  
 the Norman Conquest a small church    
 with nave and chancel was built on the
 present site. The 13th century was a  
 period of rebuilding and improvement  
 in the Early English style, a north   
 chapel was added.During the Middle    
 Ages and following the Reformation the
 church fell into disrepair.The holding
 of several benefices by one person    
 resulted in much absenteeism and the  
 church remained locked for months at a
 time.Later the north chapel was       
 boarded up and a school established in
 the chancel.Considerable restoration  
 took place during the Victorian era,  
 the north chapel was re-roofed and the
 gables reglazed.The bell tower was    
 partly rebuilt.The church was finally 
 restored in 1959 when the north chapel
 was re-opened with a new altar.       </content>
