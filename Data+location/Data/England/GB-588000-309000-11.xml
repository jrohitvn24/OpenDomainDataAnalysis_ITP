		<content>      The area landscape is very flat  
 with large fields seperated by        
 hedges.The land is very light and     
 when it rains or when the wind blows  
 when the land is very dry part of the 
 top soil is lost.  Because of this    
 more hedges are being planted to      
 prevent the loss of the soil. .       
      The{Grange}is situated on the    
 highest point of the village and was  
 built in 1864 for Â£19.17.6.  It was a 
 Rectory until 1960 when it was        
 converted into flats, then a holiday  
 home and is now being made into an old
 peoples home.
