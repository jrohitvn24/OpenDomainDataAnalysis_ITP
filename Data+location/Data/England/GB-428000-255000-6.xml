		<content> Part of an interview with the Moreton 
 Morrell Real Tennis Club Steward.     
{  Real Tennis}- Charles Garland,the   
 owner of Moreton Hall wanted to       
 become a member of Leamington         
 Real Tennis Club but they would not   
 let him because he was American.      
 So he built his own court in Moreton  
 Morrell. He built it in 1905.         
  There are seventeen courts in the    
 U.K.. All the courts vary in size.    
  The British Championships were held  
 at Moreton Morrell in 1984.The club   
 hopes to have the World Championships 
 in 1986.                              
  You have to be thirteen years old at 
 least to be a member and play because 
 of the speed of the ball and the      
 weight of the racket.Members come from
 all over the world from such countries
 as Hong Kong,Australia and the United 
 States of America.                    </content>
