		<content> In raising again the question of the  
 tap supplying water to the Allotment  
 holders at the bottom of Ivy          
 Lane,Cllr.Scutt re-iterated that the  
 District Council did not wish to      
 re-instate the tap which was removed  
 due to the high cost of the excessive 
 water used.However,the Council were   
 given to understand that several      
 letters had already been sent to      
 various departments of Arun District  
 Council on this matter and Cllr.Scutt 
 agreed to look into the matter further
 on behalf of the Council.
