		<title>07FARMING CLAPHAM-NEWBY GEN.</title>
		<content> There are many farms in the area we   
 are studying,because there is plenty  
 of grazing land and lots of water.    
 On the tops of the hills the sheep    
 graze.The lower, richer fields are    
 where the dairy cattle live.Some      
 fields have both sheep and cattle.    
 The cattle are mostly Frisian but some
 are Charolais also.The sheep are      
 mostly Dalesbred.                     
 The sheep are dipped and clipped in   
 June and July.The fleeces are rolled  
 up and put in to bags and taken to    
 Bradford,or exported to Japan.        
 The lambing time is from February to  
 April.The higher the land the later   
 the lambing because of the coldness.  
 Most farms hay-make,or silo.Silo is   
 made earlier than hay,so you can get a
 good second crop.A common time for    
 hay-making is late June,unless the    
 weather is too bad.                   </content>
