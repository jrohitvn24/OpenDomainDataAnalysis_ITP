		<content>   The garden is part of the university
 department of botany. It is widely    
 used by those both learning and teach-
 ing botany,helping them by growing a  
 wide variety of plants both indoors   
 and outdoors. Horticultural colleges  
 also gain much interest out of the    
 garden. The present area of 40 acres  
 was founded in 1831 but an earlier    
 garden of 5 acres had been established
 in the city centre since 1762 (the    
 site is now occupied by laboratories).
 The garden was not completed till 1951
 when the late Mr Reginald Cory left a 
 large bequest for the gardens in his  
 will. There are many notable features 
 including its splendid collection of  
 trees,several different kinds of rock-
 eries including limestone and tufa,   
 chronological beds, an area left to   
 grow wild like a fen, herbaceous beds 
 and many interesting and exotic plants</content>
