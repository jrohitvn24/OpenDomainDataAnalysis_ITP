		<title>10ST. LAWRENCE CHURCH</title>
		<content>      Bovingdon Parish Church was first
 built in 1320. Then restored, probably
 because of being unsafe, in 1846. They
 kept the floor and tower. The tower   
 is about 80 feet tall. On March the   
 first next year the church will be 140
 years old.                            
      One family the Ryder family, paid
 mostly for the restoration of the     
 church. There are 6 windows and 7     
 stone tablets in memory of the Ryder  
 family.                               
      They kept 2 bells. They had the  
 first bell in 1654 and the second one 
 year later. There  were also 2 other  
 bells which were put in recently. Now 
 they are rung by electricity.
