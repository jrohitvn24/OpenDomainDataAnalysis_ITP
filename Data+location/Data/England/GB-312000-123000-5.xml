		<title>05TRANSPORT AROUND MILVERTON</title>
		<content>      FROM MILVERTON, EVERY DAY EIGHT  
 BUSES GO TO WIVELISCOMBE, LANGLEY     
 MARSH AND MAUNDOWN. EIGHT BUSES GO TO 
 HILLCOMMON, TONE VALE HOSPITAL, NORTON
 FITZWARREN, BINDON ROAD AND TAUNTON.  
 THE BUS NUMBER IS 205. NOT MANY PEOPLE
 USE THE BUS. ON MONDAY,JULY 8TH 1985, 
 THREE PEOPLE GOT ON THE TAUNTON BUS AT
 11.50, AND TWELVE PEOPLE WERE ALREADY 
 ON IT. NOBODY GOT ON THE TAUNTON BUS  
 AT 1.50, AND ONLY FIVE PEOPLE WERE    
 SITTING ON IT. A PRIVATE COMPANY RUNS 
 A SERVICE TO WIVELISCOMBE AND         
 WELLINGTON SIX TIMES A DAY.           
                                       
      NO BUSES AT ALL RUN THROUGH OAKE 
 VILLAGE. IN FACT, NO OTHER BUSES RUN  
 ANYWHERE IN OUR DOMESDAY SQUARE. THE  
 RAILWAY LINE HAS CLOSED DOWN. SO      
 PEOPLE WHO WANT TO TRAVEL WHERE THE   
 BUS DOES NOT RUN HAVE GOT TO TRAVEL BY
 CAR.                                  </content>
