 There is nothing much to do in the    
evenings particularly for young people.
In the summer they hang about the      
bridge at the end of Chapel Lane, there
is usually no trouble but people who   
live nearby complain about bad language
and the noise because some of the boys 
have motorbikes.                       
 The telephone box is vandalised by    
having its windows broken, now they are
made of plastic but this is covered in 
names scratched on. The village notice 
board is often wrecked &amp; the bus       
shelter is covered with graffiti. Not  
long ago a gang of youths came from    
Benson &amp; Wallingford, there was a big  
fight to which the police were called. 
 Even at Youth Club things get busted  
up just for "fun".  I think it's silly.
