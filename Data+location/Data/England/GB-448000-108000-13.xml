		<title>13    Strawberries cont...</title>
		<content> The railway was originally used to    
 transport the strawberries from this  
 area to the markets.Many tons past    
 through the railway each day.The      
 strawberries had to be packed by small
 ,young boys so they could fit between 
 the stacks of boxes.                  
                                       
 The punnets used to be made out of    
 wicker with wooden tomatoe boxes for  
 carrying.Now they are put in plastic  
 punnets with cardboard trays.Most     
 strawberries were taken through Botley
 as opposed to Fareham.                
 Fareham refused to handle strawberries
 because there would be so many horses 
 and carts, creating traffic jams and  
 big turds outside the station.
