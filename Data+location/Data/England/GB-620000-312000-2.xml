		<content>  The Firs Speedway Stadium used to    
stand in land between Windsor and      
Cromer Road.The area is now taken up by
residential houses and the playing     
fields of Firside School.Firside began 
its life as a secondery modern school  
but they became first a junior and     
later a middle school.                 
     The 1st World War brought the     
main Egerton Aircraft factories to the 
site on Cromer Road.                   
 Norwich Airport was originally an     
operational base for the RAF and during
the 2nd World War an American squadron 
of Flying Fortresses used the airfield.
During this time an American   plane   
crashed on Hastings Avenue. All of     
StewardsonÂ£s nurseries have gone to    
make way for new housing.Italian POW's 
were housed along  Middleton's Lane    
and were employed in the market garden 
buisness.                              </content>
