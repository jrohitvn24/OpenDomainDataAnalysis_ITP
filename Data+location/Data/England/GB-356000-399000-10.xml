		<title>10A SHOPPING PRECINCT A-IN-M</title>
		<content> In the 19th century there was a pub in
 Gerard Street called the Gerard       
 Arms.The pub was named after Lord     
 Gerard, Lord Gerard owned all of      
 Ashton, and even now his family still 
 owns a lot of land.The Gerard arms    
 closed in 1960, and in 1965 it became 
 a night club.This again closed in     
 1970.                                 
       In 1983 it was modernised and   
 opened as a shopping precinct called  
{GREENSWAY}.Greensway has various      
 shops,such as "Second to None" were   
 you can buy clothes at reasonable     
 prices.There is also a baby Boutique  
 were you can buy pretty clothes for   
 your baby.The list is almost endless, 
 from socks,  to keeping up with the   
 chart hits of today.
