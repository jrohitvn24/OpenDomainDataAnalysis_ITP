 infant teacher,a part time teacher and
 a teaching head. The most recent      
 headteacher was called{Mrs Bell}and   
 when the school closed she was        
 transfered down to{Rosebank}First     
 School in Burley. When the school     
 first opened{sixty-six children}went  
 but when{Burley Middle}school opened  
 the number went down to forty-six.    
 The children started at the school at 
 five and finished at eleven years old.
 Of the{forty six children,}only{six}  
 came from Burley Woodhead. Both games 
 lessons and playtimes were held on the
 nearby moor. Dinners were brought up  
 in heated tins by a lady called{Mrs   
{Myers}who served them and then        
 washed  up.

 used as a Countryside centre for      
 teachers and school children.         </content>
