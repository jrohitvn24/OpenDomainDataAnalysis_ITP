		<title>15BLACK BOURTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The village has an entry in the{      
{Domesday Book}under{Burton Abbots.    
{Black Friars}from{Osney Abbey}are     
 thought to have worked in the Manor   
 farm area and lodged at{Burton},giving
 the village its name. Today it is a   
 small community of about 200 people.  
 The 60 children of school age receive 
 their education from neighbouring     
 towns &amp; villages. They have a local   
 playground but no village shop. The   
 old cottages retain their character &amp; 
 some  are still bundle thatched. A    
{village association}has been set up to
 develop the community spirit of the   
 village. The church of{St.Mary The    
{Virgin}was given to Osney Abbey in    
{1180.}It contains{13th Century Murals.
 The vicar lives at Shilton and looks  
 after 5 churches altogether. The      
 graveyard was extended for Carterton  
 burials &amp; has a military section too. </content>
