There are not any wildlife parks in    
the area but at least there is some    
grass and fields.   For instance there 
is the marlhole.   There are many      
animals there but you do not see them  
often.   There are birds, mice,        
rabbits,snakes and many insects.       
There are two big ponds in the southern
part of Apedale where a few swans      
paddle.                                
Many types of birds were seen during   
our observations, the most common      
being wood pigeon, lapwing, skylark,   
swallow and magpie.   There was also   
evidence of foxes, badgers, and rabbits
in the area.   The rural part of the   
area is criss-crossed by many public   
footpaths, but many stiles must be     
negotiated.
