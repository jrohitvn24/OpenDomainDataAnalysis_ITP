		<content> The school was built in 1969 under the
 North Riding Authority. Since 1974    
 the school has been within the newer  
 'Cleveland' county. The school caters 
 for children from 7 to 11 years of    
 age.                                  
      There are now 330 children on    
 roll, after a a peak of 450 in the    
 late 70's. There are 14 members of    
 staff. The school has its own kitchen 
 providing some 240 meals daily. The   
 curriculum ranges through             
 Needlework, P.E., Computer Studies,   
 Science, Music, and basic 'three R'   
 subjects.                             
      The school organises visits to   
 Belgium and, more locally, summer     
 camping weekends.                     
      We are one of three Skelton      
 Schools. There is an Infant school,   
 and De Brus Comprehensive School named
 after the famous Robert who lived here</content>
