		<title>15Outdoor Education Centre.</title>
		<content>    In the 1960's a small piece of land
was rented at Stanley Head Farm on     
which local schools camped.They also   
sailed and canoed on nearby Stanley    
Pool.In 1967,the City of Stoke-on-Trent
purchased the farm for 25,000 pounds   
and developed it as an Outdoor         
Education Centre.It now belongs to the 
county of Staffordshire and it is used 
by over two hundred schools annually.  
The old farm buildings have been turned
into a dormitory,dining room,kitchen   
and recreational accommodation.Schools 
may attend on a daily or a weekly      
residential basis.Secondary school     
pupils do map reading,orienteering,rock
climbing,caving,sailing and canoeing.  
Younger children study animal and plant
life around the centre,go pond dipping 
and attempt some basic orienteering.   
Sometimes they leave the centre to make
a study of the surrounding villages.   </content>
