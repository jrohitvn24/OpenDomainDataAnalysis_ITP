There is a Playing  Field Association, 
they keep their tools in the big garage
over there.There are two,quite large   
allotments both on the road to Roade.  
There is one just past the church and  
another one a bit further on. It is    
quite a good little village for        
electricity.They turn the lights on    
when it starts to get dark  and turn   
them off again at 12 0 clock midnight. 
There is a District Nurse who comes    
round sometimes but you do not see her 
a lot.There are a few Meals On  Wheels 
which deliver dinners to the aged.     
Their headquarters is  at Cripps       
House. Also there is a Merry Comrades  
group.They do not meet anywhere so if  
there is a Bazaar or anything they     
either phone up or send a letter. There
is also a playschool in the village    
hall.         Craig Triggs,11 yrs.     </content>
