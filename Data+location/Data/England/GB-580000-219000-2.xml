		<content> The villlage centre,conveniently has  
 a bakers,butchers,hardware and wool   
 shop.The Co-op Supermarket,which also 
 incorporates the Post Office,sells    
 foodstuffs quite cheaply.Children shop
 at Mrs.Dunn's store,because she waits 
 patiently while they choose favourite 
 sweets.The Pioneer Stores,sells food  
 and is also a newsagents.There is a   
 hairdresser and fish and chip shop!!  
 The only omissions are a chemist and  
 bank.The shops are well patronised but
 many families journey to nearby towns 
 for large weekly or monthly purchases 
 where prices are more competitive.    
 Boars Tye and Western Garage provide  
 petrol and car repairs.The half hourly
 bus service goes to Braintree and     
 Witham.There is a surgery and baby    
 clinic and a community policeman lives
 in the village.The Hotel and The      
 Western Arms are the local pubs.      </content>
