		<title>05BICKINGTON,BARNSTAPLE.</title>
		<content> Mr Gayton is a man who has lived in   
{Bickington}all his life,45 years.We   
 asked him some questions on how       
{Bickington}has changed during that    
 time.{Bickington}is ten times bigger  
 than it was 45 years ago.Mr Gayton    
 went to{Bickington}school,which was a 
 small village school that closed in   
 the 1950's.You were not allowed to    
 speak in class. There used to be two  
 shops and a post office with a shop.  
{Bickington}was a village where there  
 was not much traffic, mostly horses   
 and carts.It was much quieter than it 
 is now.Mr Gayton thought that         
{Bickington}was better when he was a   
 youngster because it was a village and
 friendlier. When the by_pass is built 
 it might be like old{Bickington}again 
 Now you can not cross the road for    
 traffic going to Barnstaple,sometimes 
 you have to wait for half an hour.    </content>
