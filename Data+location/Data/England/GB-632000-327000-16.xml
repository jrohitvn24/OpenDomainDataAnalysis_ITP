		<title>16A HONING SCHOOL DAY</title>
		<content> In the mornings I let the kittens in  
 for their food. When dad wakes up he  
 makes pure orange drink for us from   
 three oranges and a spponful of honey.
 After a breakfast of Ricicles I drink 
 warm milk and sugar. Then I wash my   
 face,clean my teeth and comb my hair. 
 We come to school at 8.55am. in the   
 mornings we have assembly and then    
 usually read and do English language  
 and maths activities. Recently I      
 particularly enjoyed writing headlines
 for imaginary news reports. In maths I
 am learning about acute, obtuse and   
 right angles. In the afternoons we do 
 art and craft, music,science,topic    
 work,story, games and dancing,for     
 which, as there are so few of us, we  
 travel to Dilham school, as do the    
 pupils of Smallburgh school, on Friday
 afternoons. School closes at 3.30pm.
