     ON SUNDAY,JULY 14TH 1985,ON A     
DRIZZLY MORNING I CYCLED ROUND THIS    
AREA TO COLLECT EVIDENCE OF SHOPPING   
FACILITIES.                            
     THE FIRST TWO AREAS WERE BUNGALOW 
ESTATES BUILT FOR RETIRED PEOPLE AND   
EACH OFFERED SIMILAR SERVICES: POST    
OFFICE, HAIRDRESSER,FOOD,OFF-LICENCE   
AND DURABLE GOODS.                     
     IN THE OTHER TWO AREAS THE EXTRA  
SERVICES WERE MAINLY ELECTRICAL GOODS. 
THERE WAS ONLY ONE CHEMIST IN THE WHOLE
AREA SURVEYED.                         
     IN AN AGE OF SUPER-STORES AND     
PRIVATE TRANSPORT,SHOPPING SEEMS TO    
HAVE BECOME SOMETHING OF AN            
ENTERTAINMENT  AND ONE WONDERS HOW     
MUCH LONGER SMALL TRADERS CAN CONTINUE 
TO SURVIVE.THEY MUST,I SUPPOSE,TRY TO  
OFFER SPECIALIST SERVICES.
