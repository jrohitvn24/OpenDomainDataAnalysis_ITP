		<title>02Mollington Village (General)</title>
		<content> The West side contains most of the    
 older properties,being constructed    
 extensively on the local mellow yellow
 Hornton stone.This stone is much      
 favoured in all the surrounding       
 villages being used on most new       
 property to conform to the            
 "environment".                        
 The village lies on the South West    
 facing slope of the Valley with       
 splendid open views across to Edge    
 Hill which creates magnificent sunsets
 on most evenings during Summer.       
 There has been considerable building  
 in the village over the last 50       
 years,with small pockets of high      
 quality private houses,in between the 
 old original buildings.Several of the 
 original Farms land have been sold of 
 for house building leaving the large  
  Farmhouses standing amidst the new   
 properties.                           </content>
