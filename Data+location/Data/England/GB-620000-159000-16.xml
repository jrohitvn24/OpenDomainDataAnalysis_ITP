		<content>     A few years ago there were meadows
 in the{Great}and{Little Stour Valleys;
 now there are extensive lakes.        
        {*** Seaton Lakes ***}         
     The lakes at{Seaton}have been     
 formed by the extraction of gravel    
 from the marsh. Excavation started in 
 1972 and is expected to be completed  
 in about seven years time. They       
 extract about 350 tons of gravel per  
 day. The water in the lakes is about  
 three metres deep. There are three    
 excavators working on the marsh and   
 the gravel is carried by a long       
 conveyor belt (at present about 1000m 
 long and soon to be 1800m long) to the
 processing plant at{Ickham.           
       {*** Stodmarsh Lakes ***        
     These formed as a result of       
 mining subsidence. The area of water  
 increased considerably after Chislet  
 coal mine was closed in 1968/69.      </content>
