		<content> Designated a conservation area, one of
 the major concerns is the disappearing
 hedgerows which have followed the     
 introduction of highly mechanised     
 intensive farming. There is evidence  
 that farmers are now much more        
 concerned about the environment,and   
 there is hope for the future, but     
 meanwhile the damage has been done and
 the appearance of the landscape has   
 much changed. Stubble burning,        
 although on the whole well controlled 
 by local farmers, is another concern, 
 though inevitably they have a         
 different perspective from non-       
 farmers. There is still a wide variety
 of wildlife in the 3 main habitats -  
 open land, woodlands, and rivers and  
 ponds. This includes the badger, fox, 
 rabbit, stoat, weasle, mole and hare  
 as well as two kinds of deer.
