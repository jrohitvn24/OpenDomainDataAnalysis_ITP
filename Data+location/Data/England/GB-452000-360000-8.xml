		<title>08KING'S MILL</title>
		<content>{HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO}MANSFIELD WAS   
 ALL TREES AND FIELDS AS IT WAS PART OF
 SHERWOOD FOREST.GRADUALLY,BECAUSE THE 
 WATER IN THE RIVER WAS SO GOOD MILLS  
 GREW UP AROUND THE RIVER AND THERE WAS
 ONE WHERE KING'S MILL RESEVOIR NOW IS.
 IT IS CALLED KING'S MILL BECAUSE WHEN 
 IT WAS A MILL IT WAS VISITED BY THE   
 KING,WHO WAS THEN HENRY II.HE WAS OUT 
 HUNTING BUT BECAME LOST SO HE STAYED  
 WITH JOHN COCKLE THE MILLER.EVEN      
 THOUGH THE KING FOUND OUT THAT JOHN   
 COCKLE POACHED HIS DEER, HE WAS SO    
 GRATEFUL TO HIM FOR GIVING HIM SHELTER
 THAT INSTEAD OF HAVING HIM KILLED, HE 
 KNIGHTED HIM.                         
 BECAUSE OF THE WATER AND THE FINE     
 QUALITY OF THE WOOL FROM THE FOREST   
 SHEEP,THE HOSIERY TRADE GREW UP ABOUT 
 250 YEARS AGO.TODAY THE HOSIERY MILLS 
 ARE STILL AROUND AND THERE IS A PUB   
 CALLED'SIR JOHN COCKLE'ON SUTTON ROAD.</content>
