{  Condovers}farm house has been       
 restored.{The Manor House}is tumbling 
 down although some enterprising person
 may restore it someday.The farm house 
 next to it is being restored all      
 ready.                                
  {Well House}is a pleasant cottage    
 beside the rather over-grown pond, and
{The Kings Head }survives from another 
 century when coaches came down        
 Turnpike Road bringing people to drink
 the Spa waters.These have disappeared 
 nowadays.                             
   In Chadwell is{Sleepers}Farm.It is a
 white-washed cottage with a thatched  
 roof next to the crossroads.{Daniel   
{Defoe}had it built there and it is    
 where he wrote Robinson Crusoe.When he
 looked down over the deserted         
 marshes perhaps he could well         
 imagine being alone.                  </content>
