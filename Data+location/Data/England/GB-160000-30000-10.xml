 Godolphin House stands on the lower   
 slopes of Godolphin Hill and was the  
 home of the Godolphin family until the
 mid-18th century.                     
 There has been a house on the site    
 since Norman times and the present    
 building dates from 1475.  It has two 
 main courtyards with all the large    
 windows facing inwards.  Only small   
 windows looked outwards because of the
 fear of raids from the sea.           
 The Godolphins were one of            
 Cornwall's most important families,   
 making their fortune from the tin     
 discovered and mined on their land    
 from early times.  Members of the     
 family held high public office with   
 Sidney, 1st Earl of Godolphin         
 (1645-1712) serving as Lord High      
 Treasurer to Queen Anne.
