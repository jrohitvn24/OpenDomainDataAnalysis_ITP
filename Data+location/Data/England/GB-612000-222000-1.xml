		<title>01Weeley Coucil Office</title>
		<content>{ }The Council Office, east of Weeley  
 was built in 1939.                    
   The population has doubled over 50  
 years.The population of Weeley was 692
 in 1931, and 50 years later in 1981   
 was 1577.In Weeley there were 689     
 houses in 1981,and also in 1981 there 
 were 408 old age pensioners. In Weeley
 there are 16 sites for new  houses.   
 There is no Mayor in Weeley because it
 is a district,not a Borough Council.  
 If the chairman of Weeley goes to     
 Colchester Borough, he cannot wear his
 chain unless he has permission from   
 the Colchester Mayor.                 
 Tendring is a Saxon area, and during  
 the war, it had to supply 100 men for 
 the army.                             
 Cllr. A. Percy Rayner is the present  
 chairman,and also had this position in
 1978, which is very unusual.
