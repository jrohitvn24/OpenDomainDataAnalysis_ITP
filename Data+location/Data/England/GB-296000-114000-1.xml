		<title>01The Area - N.E. Tiverton</title>
		<content> The area is mainly countryside with   
 lots of fields and farms. In the      
 fields sheep and cattle graze and     
 crops grow. There are three small     
 hamlets in the area,Chettiscombe,     
 Chevithorne and Craze Lowman. There is
 a small group of houses at East Mere  
 There is no bus service to the little 
 villages and there are no shops. The  
 largest hamlet (Chevithorne) once had 
 a Post Office/shop but this is now a  
 private house. At Chevithorne is the  
 church of St.Thomas and a Methodist   
 Chapel.These have regular attendances.
 A baker,milkman and greengrocer       
 deliver in the area and a mobile      
 library visits fortnightly. Most      
 people go to Tiverton for shopping.The
 children travel to the schools in     
 Tiverton as the school in Chevithorne 
 closed in 1954. The roads are narrow  
 and twisty with high banks and hedges.</content>
