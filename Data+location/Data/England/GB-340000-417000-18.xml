		<content> Many of these take place out of the   
 village but not all. Brownies meet on 
 Thursdays in Merebrow School. There   
 are Youth Clubs at the Institute and  
 Holmes Chapel. Swimming clubs at      
 Tarleton Baths. Scouts, Guides and    
 Cubs at either Rufford or Tarleton.   
   Cubs are a group of boys between 8  
 and 11yrs. They were started by Baden 
 Powell in 1907. Rufford cubs are held 
 on Thursdays from 6.30pm-8pm. We      
 usually have a game then do badge work
 and play another game before we go    
 home. At Scouts we meet at 7.30 for   
 flag break, 7.35 canoeing on the      
 canal.8.30 badge work, 8.50 football  
 9.25 flag down, 9.30 home.            
   Guides meet on Wednesdays at 7.30pm.
 We have blue uniforms with a red      
 neckerchief. Every month we go on     
 Church Parade and camp in the Summer.
