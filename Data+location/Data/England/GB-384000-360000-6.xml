		<title>06HOUSING IN CONGLETON</title>
		<content> The variety of housing in Congleton   
 reflects the 450 years of housing     
 development.                          
 A large percentage of housing in      
 Congleton was built in the last 50    
 years,and over half was built in the  
 last 25 years,these being the private 
 and cou estates.There are a handful of
 large victorian houses which date back
 more than 150 years. There are also   
 some postwar houses which are about   
 40-50 years old,they are recognised by
 the appearance of their front doors,  
 windows and hipped roofs.             
 Residential housing estates play a big
 part in catering for the population   
 who use Congleton as a dormitory town.
 These estates are situated in the     
 suburbs of the town and have been     
 extended frequently,the main building 
 material being brick and a few in     
 stone.                                </content>
