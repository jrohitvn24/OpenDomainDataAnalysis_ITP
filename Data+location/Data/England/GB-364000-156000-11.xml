		<title>11High Littleton Association.</title>
		<content>  In March 1984 two teenagers came to  
 the{High Littleton}district councillor
 and said that they had nothing to do  
 in their spare time and were bored.   
 They asked for help.                  
  The councillor suggested that they   
 should rally support for the building 
 of a village hall.Some time later she 
 went around the village carrying a    
 sandwich board advertising a meeting  
 about a village hall.Later five or six
 people volunteered for a steering     
 committee.                            
  In November there was a survey       
 carried out.This asked for family     
 details, activities followed at the   
 moment, what activities you would like
 to follow if they were available, and 
 if you were willing to help.This is   
 how the{High Littleton and Hallatrow  
{Community Association}                
 was formed.                           </content>
