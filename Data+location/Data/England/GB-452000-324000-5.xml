		<content>  Lantern Lane school is situated off  
 the main Gotham Road next door to the 
 Harry Carlton Comprehensive School.It 
 was built to accommodate children from
 new housing when the village first    
 grew.Until 1966 it was the only       
 primary school in the village and     
 became of such a size that the        
 original village school(now part of   
 Brookside School) had to be used as an
 annexe.                               
 Now that there are two schools rolls  
 have fallen and there are now less    
 than 200 pupils on roll.              
 The classrooms are large and there is 
 ample storage space.                  
 Children enter school on the Tuesday  
 after their fifth birthday and leave  
 to commence their secondary education 
 during their eleventh year.           
 The school now has a modern nursery   
 unit.                                 </content>
