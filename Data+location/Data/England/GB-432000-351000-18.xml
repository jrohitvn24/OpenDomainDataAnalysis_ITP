		<content> The range of occupations of the       
 Fritchley population is extremely     
 varied. 5% of the total are in primary
 industry, 26% in manufacturing, and   
 51% in services. Out of 81 people who 
 responded to our survey, the largest  
 group for one job was teaching (9),   
 followed by the health service (8).   
 Management catered for 8 jobs and     
 Stevensons dyers in Bullbridge        
 employed 8 people. Jobs such as       
 weaver, confectioner, dental ceramist,
 sub postmaster, marine engineer and   
 Assistant County Sailing Master are   
 all included and this shows the       
 diversity of employment. The location 
 of people's work also varies, but     
 there are only 3 people who have to   
 travel more than 20 miles. 5 people   
 work in Fritchley and 13 work within a
 mile of Fritchley. 50% live less than 
 5 miles away.                         </content>
