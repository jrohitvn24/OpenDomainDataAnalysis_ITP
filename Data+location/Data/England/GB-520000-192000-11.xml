		<content> HOUSING SURVEY FOR THE PUPILS AT ST.  
 PAUL'S CHURCH OF ENGLAND SCHOOL.      
  In a class survey we found the       
 following.                            
  40% of the children lived in a       
 detached house,28% lived in a semi-   
 detached house and 16% lived in a     
 terraced house.                       
  It was difficult to date all the     
 homes but 4% were pre 1900,12% were   
 between 1900 and 1940 and 16% were    
 between 1920 and 1940 and 16% were    
 between 1940 and the present day.     
  Our street survey indicates that the 
 vast majority of houses were built    
 between the wars while a few are pre  
 1914.The vast majority were owner-    
 occupied.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
