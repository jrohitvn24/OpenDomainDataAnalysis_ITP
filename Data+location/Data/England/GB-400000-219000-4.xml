		<content>                                       
                                       
 The farm is situated right at the top 
 of the hill by Whittington.Compared   
 with other farms in the area,this farm
 gets dry more quickly in the summer   
 and colder in the winter because of   
 the hilly terrain.                    
    Mr.Roe works very long hours-on    
 average 8 hours a day plus a lot of   
 hard working overtime when he is      
 harvesting.                           
    Mr.Roe employs 3 full time         
 workers.They are 2 cowmen and a       
 tractor man.                          
    If you start up a fsrm it is very  
 expensive and can be a bit of a gamble
 because if you put all of your money  
 into the first year and you have bad  
 weather you could lose all the money  
 and hard work you have put into the   
 farm.                                 </content>
