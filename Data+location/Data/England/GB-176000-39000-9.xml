		<content> The total  area of farm land in Feock 
 Parish is  723.6 hectares  and in the 
 whole of  Cornwall  there are 278321.4
 hectares.   In Feock the total area of
 land rented is 315.8 hectares and  the
 land owned is 407.8 hectares.     This
 shows that the farmers who live in Fe-
 ock  are  richer  than  those in  many
 other parts of Cornwall.              
 There are 37 farms in the area,    two
 thirds of which  are only worked part-
 time,  showing that most  farmers have
 to have another job as well.  Most are
 dairy or cattle farms.                
 Most of the farms are under 2 hectares
 in area.                              
 There are hardly  any  fruit  orchards
 and the  only commercial  orchards are
 for gooseberries and blackcurrants.   
 There is only a handful of non-commer-
 ial orchards.                         
 Part of Feock Parish is in our block. </content>
