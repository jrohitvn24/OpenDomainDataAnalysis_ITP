		<content> Stamford has long been noted for its  
 wealth of churches. Today, in 1985,   
 there are six Anglican churches(see   
 p.14) as well as a Roman Catholic     
 church, Methodist church, Free church,
 United Reformed church, Baptist       
 church, Salvation Army citadel and    
 Pentecostal church. Divine healing    
 services and 'Glory' meetings take    
 place on occasions.                   
 Besides the recognised Christian      
 Churches there is a thriving Jehovahs 
 Witness group, a branch of the Mormon 
 church and the Christadelphians.      
 Through the Stamford Council of       
 Churches an ecumerical mission was    
 held in 1984 for the whole town.      
 Christian church groups regularly join
 together for united services and other
 events, including the Stamford        
 Festival in July. Christianity is very
 much a part of Stamfords rich heritage</content>
