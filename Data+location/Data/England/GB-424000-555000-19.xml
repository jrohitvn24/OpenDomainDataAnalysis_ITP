		<content> Trade in Birtley ranges from a number 
 of small businesses such as D.I.Y.    
 shops, hairdressers, take-away food   
 shops, and newsagents/confectioners to
 larger scale food stores (Supermarket)
 and Banks.                            
 Whilst larger industrial complexes    
 have suffered as a result of the      
 recession, the smaller shops appear to
 have coped fairly well, with little   
 evidence of the closure. Indeed       
 several second hand shops giving      
 D.H.S.S. estimates have sprung up in  
 the town to provide a service for the 
 people who through redundancy have    
 little money available to spend. It is
 probably because of the financial     
 limitations, that there are few       
 fashionable clothes shops, people     
 instead spend their money on          
 essentials which could explain the    
 preponderance of food shops.          </content>
