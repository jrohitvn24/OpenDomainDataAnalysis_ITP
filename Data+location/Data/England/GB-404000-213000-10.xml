		<title>10THE PARISH OF YANWORTH TODAY</title>
		<content>{    St.Michael &amp; All Angels}-electoral
 roll 17- is in the Northleach deanery.
 As elsewhere  falling  attendances has
 meant  joining  parishes  but in rural
 areas the population is  also falling.
 Although  only {one  service} is  held
 alternate Sundays,  Yanworth is one of
 a group of local parishes that realise
 the church must change with the times.
     Seeing the problem  of  housebound
 old  people the local churches started
 a{day centre}at Chedworth 3 kms. away.
 Here  opportunities for craft sessions
 and a  good  meal  are  provided  once
 a  week and  some  of Yanworth's older
 residents,  helped by  their volunteer
 drivers, enjoy this facility. Although
 the churches still give  active  help,
 the increasing  numbers  has  meant it
 having to be run independently.       
     Yanworth has a{bible  study  group
 and  joins in the  deanery activities.</content>
