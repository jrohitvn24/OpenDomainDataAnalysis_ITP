		<content>{CRIME}:-There is not much crime.      
 Chain-saws and tractor batteries are  
 sometimes stolen from farms. Security 
 on farms is poor because you cannot   
 lock up everything. Suicide is very   
 rare but it was quite common when     
 people would throw themselves down    
 wells.                                
{SCHOOLS}:-There are only two schools; 
 Cumnor House for ages 4-13 and        
 Danehill primary school for ages 5-11.
 Danehill children are in the catchment
 area of Chailey comprehensive.        
{PARISHES}:-Danehill, Fletching and    
 Nutley are the three parishes in the  
 area. Danehill occupies the major part
 of the square, Fletching and Nutley   
 occupying the bottom and top right    
 corners respectively.
