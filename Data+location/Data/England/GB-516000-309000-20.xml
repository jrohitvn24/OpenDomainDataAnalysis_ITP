		<title>20DEEPING ST.JAMES FORAGE</title>
		<content>     The forage merchant in the village
 deals mainly in straw and hay.Some of 
 which he gets from his own land but   
 most of which he buys from other farm-
 ers in the area.                      
     Two men work for the merchant.They
 have four large lorries for transport-
 ing the bales as far away as Cheshire 
 and Staffordshire.Three of the lorries
 can pull an extra trailer if the load 
 is very large.When fully laden these  
 lorries can carry about seven tonnes  
 of hay.                               
     They deliver to Army Training     
 Centres,Manchester Police Stables,    
 Riding Schools,and to farms.Some of   
 the loads go to a company where it is 
 processed into cattle pellets.A small 
 percentage is also used for thickening
 soups.Another buyer is a large paper  
 mill which makes a coarse paper out of
 the straw.                            </content>
