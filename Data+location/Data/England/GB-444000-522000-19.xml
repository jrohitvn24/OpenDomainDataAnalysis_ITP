		<title>19A Day in the life of Emma</title>
		<content> In the morning I have my breakfast of 
 cereal with milk and a cup of tea.    
 Then I get washed and dressed. Some   
 days I have to be very quiet as Dad   
 has just come off nightshift. He works
 different 8 hour shifts. I wait for   
 Lucy then we walk for five minutes to 
 reach school. I deliver the registers 
 to the classrooms. At nine o'clock the
 bell rings. We do daily 10 sums until 
 Assembly time. Later we do maths until
 break. After play we do English and at
 about 11.45 our teacher reads us a    
 story. I go for dinner at 12.00 and   
 eat my packed lunch. In the afternoon 
 we do our communications project.     
 Later we have playtime then we have a 
 free choice lesson. School finishes at
 3.30. After tea I play with Lucy.
