		<title>10The Blacksmith.</title>
		<content> The land around Great Brickhill has   
 always been popular for horses. Today 
 there are stud farms situated around  
 the village.The original Blacksmith's 
 shop was burned down so another house 
 was built. The old workshop is still  
 in use for shoeing all the horses     
 around the village. This village has  
 always been the centre of many        
 stables. Some of the original tools   
 are still used in the blacksmith's    
 shop. The original bellows are still  
 used for the fire. The Blacksmith     
 family in Great Brickhill was always  
 called 'Smith' but today the          
 Blacksmiths family are called 'Head'.
