		<title>09MODERN FACILITIES FOR HEALTH</title>
		<content> Modern health facilities and their    
 importance in a village community is  
 essential as there is no hospital in  
 the area. The nearest one is four     
 miles away in Milton Keynes. Two      
 doctors' surgeries are available to   
 inhabitants, one in Woburn Sands and  
 the other in Cranfield, likewise the  
 nearest chemist for obtaining medical 
 requirements and prescriptions. Some  
 incapacitated and elderly people are  
 visited by social workers and home    
 helps. The District Nurse for the area
 is based in Cranfield. There are a few
 people who need wheel chairs and      
 walking frames but on the whole health
 is fairly good in this district.      
 People do get colds, influenza, high  
 blood pressure and rheumatism. The    
 nearest dental surgery is in Woburn   
 Sands, so is the osteopath. Health    
 shops are in Milton Keynes &amp; Bedford. </content>
