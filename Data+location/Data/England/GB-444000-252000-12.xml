		<content> Ten acres of land was purchased two   
 years ago by a resident of Mollington.
 He now has ten poly-tunnels erected   
 and plans to build more. At present he
 draws his water from the canal feeder 
 which runs by his land. In these      
 tunnels he is growing perennials and  
 other bedding plants for the wholesale
 market. Approximately two acres are   
 used for the nursery and he hopes to  
 use the rest of the ground for        
 grazing. This is a comparatively new  
 venture and the only one in this grid.
