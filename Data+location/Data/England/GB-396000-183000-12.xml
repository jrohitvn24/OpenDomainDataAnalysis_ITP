		<title>12SERVICES, SOMERFORD AREA</title>
		<content>   Another consequence of living in an 
 isolated country district is the lack 
 of public services,such as shops and  
 libraries.There are several mobile    
 vans which visit this area to meet    
 these needs.                          
   Every Tuesday,Thursday and Saturday 
 a baker comes to our villages.He sells
 bread,cakes,biscuits,crisps and       
 sweets.                               
   A mobile van brings fruit and       
 vegetables every Wednesday and makes  
 special journeys if asked.            
   Every Thursday at 6.00pm a fish and 
 chip van stops at the crossroads in   
 Little Somerford.This is a much used  
 service.                              
   Once a fortnight,on a Monday a      
 mobile library van serves the area and
 also calls at Hill House,the old      
 peoples home.
