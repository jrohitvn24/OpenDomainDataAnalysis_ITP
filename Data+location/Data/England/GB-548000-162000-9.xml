		<title>09The Old Post Office.</title>
		<content> On Wednesday Class 2 went to visit the
Old Post Office.We first saw some deeds
and old photographs that had been given
the owner Mr.Lambert.We went upstairs  
to see the bedrooms and Mr. Lambert    
showed us a cannon ball and a sword    
that he had found.We went into another 
bedroom where Mr. Lambert showed us the
old beams and pegs that had lasted     
since the house had been first built.  
 The Post Office is over 250 years old 
and was last used in 1983. Mr Lambert  
showed the cellar under the first      
floor.After this we had a glass of     
orange juice in the back garden.In the 
garden was an old pump with a handle   
that still worked.Mr.Lambert let us all
have a go.After this we all said       
thank you to Mr.Lambert and went back  
to school.
