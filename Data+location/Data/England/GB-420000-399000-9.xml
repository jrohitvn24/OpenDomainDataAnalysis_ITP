		<content>  The majority of the roads are fairly 
 quiet C-class roads,but there are some
 A-roads,including the A616 along the  
 valley bottom.The roads mainly run    
 south to Stocksbridge and north to    
 Penistone and Barnsley.As well as cars
 and bicycles,the roads are used by    
 tractors from the local farms and     
 lorries supplying the steelworks:most 
 of the roads do not allow vehicles    
 over 3 tonnes.                        
  There are few bus routes.They run to 
 Barnsley and arrive at the stops twice
 a day.                                
  A old railway line runs through the  
 area, although there are no           
 stations.The trains ran to Sheffield  
 and Manchester.                       
  Stocksbridge Works have a private    
 railway,whose sidings lie near        
 Underbank Reservoir.
