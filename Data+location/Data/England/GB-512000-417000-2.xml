		<content> There are quite a few{bus stops}in    
 East Halton. There is a bus stop in   
 King Street at a letter box near the  
{lorry yard,}there is one outside the  
 school and one outside the Post       
 Offfice. There is a bus which takes   
 the chldren to Immingham Comprehensive
 school. It stops at Magers lorry yard 
 and outside the Post Office.          
    Not many people use buses because  
 most people have cars. People without 
 a car find it is difficult to go to   
 Grimsby or Immingham because there are
 not many buses. I think we should have
 more buses because old people can't   
 travel.                               
    The nearest{railway station}is near
{Thornton Abbey.}It is on the branch   
 line to Barton. Not many trains use   
 that line. More trains stop at        
{Habrough station}but it is further    
 away.                                 </content>
