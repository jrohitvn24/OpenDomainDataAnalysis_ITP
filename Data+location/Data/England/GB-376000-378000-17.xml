		<content>      The Margaret Barclay Residential 
 School for physically handicapped     
 children was once a private house set 
 in 14 acres of garden.  The house was 
 built in 1850 but in 1940 Sir Noton   
 Barclay became the owner.  During the 
 war, Sir Noton, who had a physically  
 handicapped daughter named Margaret,  
 offered to accommodate handicapped    
 children from Manchester.  After      
 Margaret died, Sir Noton gave the     
 house to Manchester Education         
 Committee to run as a physically      
 handicapped school.                   
      The school has accommodation for 
 48 children drawn from the North West 
 of England.  There are 48 domestic and
 professional staff under the          
 headmaster Mr. William Horsfall.The   
 children stay at school up to the age 
 of 17 or 18.  At present the school is
 under threat of closure.              </content>
