		<title>16The College Grounds.</title>
		<content>  Ampleforth College has been famous   
 for sports and has always had its     
 rugby and cricket grounds. For rugby  
 there are about 20 pitches. They are  
 in groups which are called 'Colts',   
 'Jungle', 'Ram', 'Lion wood' and      
 'Brickfields'. There are 3 cricket    
 pitches. The 2 main pitches both have 
 pavilions: in one rests a ball used   
 when England played Australia in 1932 
 which is signed by many of the        
 players.                              
  Also in the grounds are 2 cinder     
 tracks used for athletics. The 400    
 metre one is called 'Red Track' and   
 the one around the '1st XV' rugby     
 pitch is the 'Black Track'.           
  There are 21 hard tennis courts      
 which are used by the school. There   
 is also the Saint Alban's Centre which
 is used for many indoor sports.
