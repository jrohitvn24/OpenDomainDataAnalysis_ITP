		<content> Mr.Bradford lives in Godstone's Old   
 People's Homes. He used to play ball  
 games but now he is incapable of this.
 The warden looks after him and treats 
 him well. The Home has been there for 
 10 years and Mrs.Cambert,Mrs.Redford  
 and Mrs.Smith have worked there since 
 it opened. Mr.Walter Coleman,98 years 
 old,is the oldest resident.           
        In Blechingley,the hospital    
 was used for old folk but in 1985, it 
 was demolished to make room for       
 housing. The old people were moved to 
 homes near Redhill and Reigate.
