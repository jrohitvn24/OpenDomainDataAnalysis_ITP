  {1:}This SECTION of SWEET CHESTNUT   
 trunk shows the annual growth rings in
 the timber and some of the events that
 occurred during its life are          
 indicated.                            
  {2:}SWEET CHESTNUT can be seen       
 growing near the track. Regrowth from 
 this old stump has occurred since the 
 tree was felled in 1968. It has very  
 durable timber which is useful for    
 fencing                               
  {3:}The ridge crossing the path is a 
 ROMAN ROAD which connected{Durnovaria}
 (Dorchester) and{Londinium}(London)   
 via Badbury Rings and Old Sarum. It is
 said that the ghost of a Roman        
 Centurian has been seen in the wood   
 after dark!                           </content>
