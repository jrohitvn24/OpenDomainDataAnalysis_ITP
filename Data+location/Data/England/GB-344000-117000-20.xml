		<content> A few years ago a French lorry driver 
 knocked down the Pinnacle in Martock. 
 Since then it has been re-built. With 
 tongue in cheek this article appeared 
 in a local paper:-A statement by Mr   
 Tiny Spire a spokesman for the EEC,   
 shook parish councils by giving       
 details of a new metric ruling saying 
 :'No Pinnacle over the height of 18 cm
 and width of 2 m will be allowed in   
 any village in the SW of England.' One
 resident suggests that the council    
 should get some obliging lorry driver 
 to knock it down to size and then     
 distribute the rock for local people's
 rockeries. Another suggested digging  
 a hole under the Pinnacle and letting 
 it drop to 18cm, then build a subway  
 for people to see what it looks like. 
 A 2m fence with a klaxon on top should
 warn people when a French lorry driver
 comes within four metres of the fence.</content>
