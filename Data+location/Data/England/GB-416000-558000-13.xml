		<content> The area with which we were concerned 
 is in a Green Belt Area .The means    
 that any development of housing or    
 industry is closely monitored.        
 This area has no heavy industry or    
 light industrial estates.The main     
 industries are farming and            
 recreation/tourism.                   
 Local people tend to work outside the 
 area in Newcastle or in the new towns 
 such as Washington or Killingworth.   
 There are opportunities for employment
 within the area but these are somewhat
 limited being restricted to local     
 shops and service industries.         
 The farming community is also rather  
 restrictive in terms of employment and
 tend to work as family units.         
 The largest single private employer   
  is probably the Pesto supermarket.
