		<title>06TOURISM IN CASTLE STREET</title>
		<content> The old centre of Portchester is      
 Castle Street, and today it is still  
 an important place for the locals.    
 The Roman and Norman castle, a place  
 of great historical interest is       
 situated a the South Eastern end of   
 Castle Street, and attracts many      
 tourists visiting Southern England.   
 Castle Street itself is steeped in    
 history but visitors to Portchester   
 are mainly interested in the Castle   
 and do not realise how old the street 
 is.  Several of the houses have       
 preservation orders on them, the      
 oldest of which is a thatched cottage 
 dating back to the 15th century.  It  
 is impossible to disassociate Castle  
 Street from its past because its      
 buildings are a living representation 
 of the Portchester that was.
