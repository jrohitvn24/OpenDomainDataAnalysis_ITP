		<content>Hand enamelling is another form of     
decorating. When the plate has been    
fired they highlight the pattern with  
colour. It takes two years training.   
One plate costs around 15 pounds.      
There are 1700 people working at       
Barlaston, but there are 7000 people   
all over the country working for       
Wedgwoods. Wedgwood chose Barlaston    
because there was a 500 acre estate for
sale and it was near the railway and   
canal. The wage depends on what        
people do. Piece workers get about one 
third more.                            
In Wedgwoods there are about the same  
number of men as there are women. For  
people who leave school and want to    
work at Wedgwoods there is a Youth     
Training scheme for 200 people. There  
are Health and Safety teams all around 
the factory making sure it is safe and 
pleasant to work in.                   </content>
