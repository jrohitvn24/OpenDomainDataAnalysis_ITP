		<content>     Our area is on the outskirts of   
 the small town of{Marple.}Half the    
 area is rural with a great deal of    
 parkland. The other half is           
 residential containing affluent       
 bungalows and architect-designed      
 houses.                               
     It is crossed be a railway which  
 runs into Manchester,by the Peak      
 Forest Canal, and by the River Goyt.  
     There are many roads and avenues  
 as well as scenic places to walk where
 once the main land use was farming.   
     The local sanatorium is now for   
 sale as the once dirty air of         
 Manchester has been cleaned up so much
 that there are no longer the many     
 respiratory diseases it was built to  
 deal with.                            
      Many of the residents are        
 socially mobile and house prices have 
 tripled in the last ten years.        </content>
