		<title>06Tourism in Sedlescombe</title>
		<content> The village of Sedlescombe is one of  
 the most beautiful in Sussex and so   
 attracts many tourists. It has a wedge
 shaped Village Green and a picturesque
 water pump.                           
                                       
 Around the Green are several old      
 timber-framed houses and one is still 
 thatched.                             
                                       
 The village has three main            
 restaurants, a cafe, two public houses
 and three antique shops.              
                                       
 Visitors are welcome to the Pestalozzi
 village by appointment. A brochure of 
 local walks can be obtained from the  
 Post Office.
