		<title>04HALLATON TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> Most families in Hallaton have at     
 least one car: this is essential if   
 working outside the village. The      
 railway line which used to serve      
 Hallaton closed in 1961, and there are
 bus services into Market Harborough on
 only two days of the week, on Tuesdays
 (two buses) and Saturdays. There is   
 also a bus to Leicester on every      
 second Wednesday of the month, and    
 the garage runs a taxi service on     
 request.                              
 There is quite a number of elderly    
 people and farm workers in particular 
 who have no transport of their own,   
 and housewives with no car for daytime
 use. Although this causes some        
 inconvenience, it does help to make   
 Hallaton feel more like a village     
 rather than a commuter outpost of     
 Leicester.
