		<title>09Shopping in Scotter</title>
		<content> The majority of Scotter's shops are   
 concentrated around the junction of   
{High Street and the A159.}There is a  
 wide range of food shops (including a 
 bakery) and a large selection of non  
 food shops selling a wide range of    
 items.These range from pet foods to   
 welding supplies.Several of the shops 
 in the latter group have changed      
 owners and merchandise in the last few
 years.Most shops try to sell a wide   
 variety of goods eg.a newsagent which 
 also sells clothing.A survey carried  
 out by school children revealed that  
 the majority of people questioned     
 thought that Scotter was a good place 
 to shop.Everybody did some shopping in
 Scotter but also used the{superstores 
 in Scunthorpe and Gainsborough.The    
 survey also revealed that people would
 like to see a large clothing and shoe 
 shop open in Scotter.                 </content>
