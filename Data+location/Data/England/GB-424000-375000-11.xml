           ===== ====                  
   We interviewed mr Alan Jacques}the  
 secretary of the{Playing Field        
 committee. The committee started work 
 on the Bridge Field in{1977}when they 
 first bought the{Bridge Field.}Then   
 they worked on the old Playing        
 Field site which was higher up the    
 river bank.                           
   When they reformed the committee in 
 1976,the old playing fields were not  
 very suitable for developing a playing
 field for{Grindleford.}The old field  
 only had{two}acres in total area where
 as the Bridge Field is almost{nine    
 acres in total area and offers plenty 
 of facilities for cricket,football and
 other sports,and that is why they     
 decided to buy the Bridge Field.
