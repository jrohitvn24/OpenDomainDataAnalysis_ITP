		<title>17JOBS ON THE STUD FARMS</title>
		<content> We talked to Mr Cazenave who works on 
 White Lodge Stud Farm. He said he gets
 up at 7.30 and gets the mares and     
 foals out to feed them. They are fed  
 on staminoats-a mix of fish guts,     
 barley and oats. At 9am he goes for   
 breakfast and then puts hay in the    
 stables. The horses are put in        
 paddocks, and go back in the stables  
 at 5pm. He has lunch at 2pm, and      
 spends the afternoon doing odd jobs,  
 like cutting the hedges. He finishes  
 at 5pm.                               
 Mr Kinsey is the stud groom. He gets  
 up at 7.30 and goes to a stud in      
 Woodditton to see that everything is  
 all right. Then he goes back to White 
 Lodge and opens the mail. He has his  
 breakfast at 9am, and at 9.30 goes    
 round the stud to check everything is 
 all right. At 11am he has coffee and  
 after lunch he helps Mr Cazenave.     </content>
