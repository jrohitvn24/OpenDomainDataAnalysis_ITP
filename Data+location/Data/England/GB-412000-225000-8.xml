		<title>08Old Cotswold Farmhouses</title>
		<content> Kineton Hill farmhouse has dates      
 inside it from the 1600's. It is on a 
 site of ancient occupation as recently
 Roman finds have come to light,       
 including a pottery kiln. We were able
 to handle saggers from the kiln on    
 which pots had been rested during     
 firing. It appears that there was     
 Roman activity along the whole length 
 of the road past Kineton Hill.        
 Swell Hill farmhouse is also very old 
 and built on an ancient site, as it is
 the only building near Condicote Lane 
 and the old drove road.               
 Other houses in the area are of later 
 origin, as most of the land once      
 belonged to one large estate.         
 Swell Buildings farm is so named      
 because it is made out of a stone     
 barn. The original farmhouse is now a 
 hotel in Lower Swell.
