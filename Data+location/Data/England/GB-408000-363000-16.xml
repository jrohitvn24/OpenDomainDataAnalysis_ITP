		<title>16Clubs &amp; Facilities - Longnor</title>
		<content>     In Longnor there is an over 60s   
club.  They play dominoes, Bingo,      
whist, etc.  They also gossip while    
they are having a cup of tea.  This    
club is held every other Thursday.     
Trips are held for the over 60s.  This 
club has been running to 3 or 4 years. 
                                       
     The British Legion take people    
out on trips and at Christmas-time     
they give the old people 5 pounds      
each.                                  
                                       
     The old people get a free         
chiropody service every month.  A      
doctor also visits the town four times 
a week.  There is a taxi which takes   
people to hospital. It costs 10 pence  
per mile. It was funded by the E.E.C.  
                                       
     There is a mobile library van     
which comes to Longnor.                </content>
