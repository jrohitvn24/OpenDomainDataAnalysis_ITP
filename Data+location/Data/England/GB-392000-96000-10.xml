		<title>10Farming at Charborough</title>
		<content>    There are twelve farms belonging to
 Charborough Estate, which is owned by 
 the{Erle-Drax}family. These farms are 
 tenanted. There are 70 men employed   
 on the Estate itself, in farming and  
 forestry.                             
    There is a large{deerpark}where    
 fallow, roe, red and sika deer roam,  
 they are culled for a venison crop.   
 The other animals are sheep, mainly   
 grey-faced mules, and a large herd of 
 Friesian dairy cows. Arable crops are 
 also grown.                           
    The farming policy is{pro-European 
 and it is considered most profitable  
 for such a big farming enterprise to  
 stick to it's present pattern of      
 farming and utilisation of land.
