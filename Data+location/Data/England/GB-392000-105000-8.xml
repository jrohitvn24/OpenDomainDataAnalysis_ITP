		<content> IN THE CHANCEL THERE IS A NORMAN      
 ARCHWAY. WE KNOW IT IS NORMAN BECAUSE 
 IT IS ROUND AND NOT POINTED. THERE ARE
 SOME ALTAR RAILS IN THE CHANCEL WHICH 
 ARE ABOUT 400 YEARS OLD.THE STAINED   
 GLASS WINDOW IN THE CHANCEL IS A      
 PICTURE OF MARY HOLDING JESUS,THE     
 THREE WISE MEN KNEELING, OFFERING     
 GIFTS TO JESUS, AND JOSEPH STANDING   
 BESIDE MARY.THERE IS A SEAT IN THE    
 CHANCEL FOR THE SQUIRE. IN THE WALL   
 OF THE CHANCEL THERE ARE TWO          
 ACOUSTIC JARS LIKE MICROPHONES AND    
 ONLY 9 OTHER CHURCHES IN ENGLAND HAVE 
 THEM.THERE ARE NO ELECTRIC LIGHTS IN  
 THE CHANCEL BECAUSE THE SQUIRE DIDNT  
 LIKE THEM. IN THE TOWER THERE ARE     
 THREE BELLS BUT ONLY ONE IS USED.THE  
 SHOPKEEPERS WIFE,MRS. MORSE, RINGS THE
 BELL.
