		<content> In Colne Valley there is a Leisure    
 Centre.On Saturday morning there is a 
 Roller disco around the main          
 hall.it costs around 50p.You can      
 hire skates for a bit more.The        
 Swimming Pool is open most days.It is 
 a 25m pool and has a single diving    
 board.There are a few allotments near 
 us which people can hire from Kirklees
 Council.They use these allotments for 
 growing vegetables and flowers,or     
 keeping pigeons or hens.Football      
 pitches can be found in the area these
 are used by local teams. A lot of the 
 local public houses run teams in the  
 local leagues.Cricket is popular      
 summer game ,although there are not as
 many local cricket teams as football  
 teams.
