		<content> The children of Digby School play many
 games at playtime.The three favourite 
 games are "Chaintig","Tiggy on the    
 lines" and "Leapfrog".                
 "Tig" is a chasing game.The catcher is
 said to be "on" and when he touches   
 someone he "tigs" them."Tiggy on the  
 lines" is played on lines marked on   
 the playground.You must stay on the   
 lines and get to a safe place called  
 "home".                               
 "Chaintig" is a variation of "Tig". If
 you are caught, you join hands with   
 the catcher to make a chain.          
 In "Leapfrog",you have to vault over  
 your partner's back while they have   
 their hands on their knees.
