		<title>17WATER TREATMENT PLANT</title>
		<content> A new water treatment plant is being  
 built at the rear of Mossley Hollins  
 High School, Huddersfield Rd.,        
 Mossley, and will be known as the     
 Buckton Castle Water Treatment Works. 
  The new scheme will supply a         
 population of 122,000 in Delph, Diggle
 Dobcross, Uppermill and Greenfield in 
 the Oldham M.B. and Ashton, Mossley,  
 Stalybridge, Audenshaw and Droylsden  
 in Tameside. These areas are at       
 present supplied by four old plants   
 called Yeoman Hey, Greenfield, Brushes
 and Swineshaw in the Greenfield and   
 Swineshaw valleys built in the period 
 1909 -1912 with extensions in 1950.   
  Some 50 megalitres of water a day    
 will be treated to remove colour,     
 iron,aluminium and manganese. The     
 Buckton Castle plant will bring       
 considerable improvements in the water
 supply to the area.                   </content>
