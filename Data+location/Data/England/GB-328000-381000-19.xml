		<title>19HOLIDAY FROM BARNSTON</title>
		<content> On our holiday on the Kintyre         
 Peninsula, Scotland,we spent 3 days on
 Machrihanish beach sitting on the     
 rocks watching a variety of wildlife. 
 One day we bought a pair of binoculars
 instead of having to use the naked    
 eye. It was a rocky beach on the West 
 Coast. We could see part of Ireland   
 clearly.                              
       Seagulls and Kittiwakes were    
 gliding busily overhead screeching and
 diving into the ocean for food.       
 Occasionally puffins ducked underwater
 catching fish. Oystercatchers hopped  
 from rock to rock calling their mates.
 In the countryside we saw Golden      
 Eagles soaring and gliding.           
       We spent a couple of evenings   
 just sitting on the rocks watching the
 seals swimming or lazing on the rocks.
       After this holiday wild life has
 become one of my favourite hobbies.   </content>
