		<content> A LOCAL GHOST STORY TELLS OF A WHITE  
 LADY WHO WALKS BRAVENER BANK ON THE   
 OUSE IN BENINGBROUGH PARK. ONE VERSION
 IS TOLD BY BARING-GOULD IN 'YORKSHIRE 
 ODDITIES' BUT HIS DATES DO NOT        
 COINCIDE WITH THE KNOWN HISTORY. IT   
 TELLS OF A BENINGBROUGH MAID WHO WAS  
 EITHER PUSHED INTO THE RIVER OR JUMPED
 IN TO ESCAPE THE UNWELCOME ADVANCES OF
 A GAME-KEEPER. ACCOUNTS OF LEGAL      
 PROCEEDINGS CONFIRM THERE WAS SUCH A  
 MURDER TRIAL. BUT WAS THE STORY OF THE
 GHOST PERPETRATED TO WARN WOULD-BE    
 POACHERS AND TRESPASSERS OFF? ANOTHER 
 LOCAL SAYING WARNED 'BEWARE THE IRON- 
 LADY (MAN-TRAP) AND THE DOGS'.ANOTHER 
 VERSION OF THE INCIDENT IN A BOOK,    
 "BENINGBROUGH HALL" BY J.L.ARMSTRONG  
 OF WORTLEY, TELLS OF THE DASTARDLY    
 MURDER OF A VIRTUOUS HOUSE-KEEPER BY A
 WICKED STEWARD IN ABOUT 1776.
