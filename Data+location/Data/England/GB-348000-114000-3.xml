		<title>03The Gold Cross of Montacute</title>
		<content> A man who lived at Montacute had a    
 recurring dream telling him that he   
 should go to the top of St. Michael's 
 Hill above the village and dig. He    
 ignored these dreams until, one       
 morning, he woke to find severe       
 scratches on his face. After this he  
 decided to go up the hill. He took up 
 a group of villagers and began to dig.
 They found a gold (cross?) artifact   
 which was taken to Winchester         
 Cathedral. It is believed to be there 
 still.                                
 The hill, Mons Acutis, now has a tower
 on its summit, on the site of a former
 castle. It is a prominent feature of  
 the landscape from many miles away.   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
