		<content>Claughton Brickworks uses clay quarried
on the fell to the south-east and tran-
sported to the works by aerial ropeway.
The manager refused to provide inform- 
ation because he disapproved of teach- 
ers'strike action in support of higher 
wages during the period of the project.
Bargh's Claughton Warehouse opened 10  
years ago.The 50 year old firm has a   
haulage business at Caton and another  
warehouse in Lancaster.The Claughton   
depot stores and delivers fertizers to 
farmers in the Lune valley,and sugar   
and syrup for Tate and Lyle all over   
the north as well as paper products for
Bowater Scott.It employs 5 local men.  
It is situated between the brickworks  
and Claughton Institute,a small wooden 
structure with ante-rooms and a hall   
where village and sometimes private    
functions are held.
