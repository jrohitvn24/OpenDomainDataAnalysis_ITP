		<content>{ The Reorganised Church of Jesus      
{Christ of Latter Day Saints}celebrates
 its 50th anniversary in Stockingford, 
 Nuneaton in June 1985.                
  The first Sunday School met in the   
 3rd Sunday in June 1935 in the front  
 room of{John Coggan's bakery/house}in 
{Haunchwood Road.}They soon had to use 
 the garage as the congregation grew   
 and in 1940 they bought and converted 
 a woodcutter's yard in{Whittleford    
{Road}and used it as their church for  
 35 years,even when the roof was bombed
 in the war.In 1975 the church moved to
 larger premises further down the road.
  The church aims to be a service to   
 the community through weddings,       
 funerals, the blessing of children and
 midweek activities such as youth      
 groups, mother and toddler groups as  
 well as weekly church school and      
 evening worship services.             </content>
