		<content> The school is the result of           
 Doncaster'S recent reorganisation of  
 secondary education. It occupies the  
 site of the old Woodfield High School 
 at the end of Weston Rd. but new      
 modern buildings were added and opened
 in 1983 to accomodate more pupils 13  
 to 16 years old, a 6th form and a     
 youth club. There is room for about   
 1200 pupils.                          
   The school day begins at 9.15 am    
 with form or year group assemblies.   
 The morning's lessons are divided into
 4 periods of 35 mins. and a 15 min.   
 break from 10.50 to 11.05 am.         
 Afternoon school begins at 1.25 pm and
 consists of 4 periods with a break    
 from 2.40 to 2.55 pm.                 
   After day school hours the buildings
 are used by adult education groups and
 for youth clubs, discos and sporting  
 activities                            </content>
