		<title>09GAMES PLAYED IN CURY SCHOOL</title>
		<content>       The children play a variety of  
 games -far too many to describe in    
 detail. They vary from simple chase   
 games such as tag or tig to more      
 complicated games involving more      
 technique. There are skipping games   
 either singly or several skipping at a
 time to a tune or rhythm. Ball games  
 are popular with the use of tennis    
 type balls for throwing and catching  
 and larger balls for kicking or       
 passing in football practice or       
 throwing and catching as in netball   
 practice. There is the use of bats and
 balls. Some play with very small      
 glass balls called marbles. There are 
 seasonal games such as conkers where  
 the best conker(horsechestnut) is     
 'kingy'. There is 'hide &amp; seek' where 
 someone has to find the rest of the   
 children. Some act out situations like
 'cowboys &amp; indians'.                  </content>
