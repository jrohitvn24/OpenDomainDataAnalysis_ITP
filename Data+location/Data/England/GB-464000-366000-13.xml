		<title>13Ollerton Village</title>
		<content>      Ollerton Village was mentioned in
 the Domesday Book, and the nucleus of 
 the village is still centred around   
 the cobbled market square.            
      The{many old buildings}include   
 the Hop Pole Hotel, an ex-coaching    
 inn;Ollerton Hall, a Georgian         
 residence which is now in the process 
 of being converted into a private     
 nursing home;St.Giles Church, built in
 1777; and a{working water-mill}built  
 in the 18th century on the site of a  
 medieval mill. Power for this is      
 provided by the{River Maun},which     
 flows through the village.            
      The village centre is quite      
 picturesque, and this, together with  
 nearby{tourist attractions}such as the
 Major Oak,Ollerton Corner,Sherwood    
 Forest Centre and the Dukeries means  
 that Ollerton Village receives a fair 
 number of visitors,mainly in summer.  </content>
