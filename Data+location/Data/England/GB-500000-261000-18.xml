      Everything in the Fox and Hounds 
 kitchen is much larger than in the    
 usual houses.  The pots and pans are  
 massive to withstand the immense heat 
 of the cookers.  Instead of having    
 cupboards to keep the pots and pans   
 in, the kitchen has wire racks so that
 the chefs can find their equipment    
 more easily.  The cookers can get up  
 to l000deg.F.  Mr. Cheeseman uses     
 fresh food to cook with.  Soon a new  
 restaurant is going to be built and   
 more food, like Sunday lunches,will   
 be served. There is also a glass      
 washer and a dishwasher in the        
 kitchen.  The glasswasher holds 20    
 glasses at once and the dishwasher    
 holds l00 pieces of crockery at once.
