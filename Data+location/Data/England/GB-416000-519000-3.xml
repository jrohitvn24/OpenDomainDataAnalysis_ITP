		<content>    This year Mr.Heslop had 130 sheep  
 which lambed. Mr.Heslop tries to give 
 each ewe 2 lambs,so some sheep are put
 in to the lamb{adopter}until they get 
 used to  their adopted lamb.There were
 13 pet lambs fed by an{artificial     
{feeder}, together they drink about 3  
 gallons of milk a day.                
      The sheep are sheared in early   
 Summer and they are put through the   
{sheep dip}to prevent maggots spoiling 
 the fleece.Sheep with foot rot are    
 driven several times through the{foot 
{bath}containing Formlyn,they are also 
 given a 7 in 1{injection}before       
 lambing so the immunity is passed on  
 to the lambs.The lambs are{wormed}and 
 they have their tails{ringed}with an  
 elastic band so they eventually fall  
 off.
