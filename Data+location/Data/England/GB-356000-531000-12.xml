		<title>12Ecology: Mammals</title>
		<content> At Beck Mill there are many different 
 kinds of mammals;hares,roe deer,foxes,
 red squirrels and rabbits.            
 The hares can be seen in open grass-  
 land where they feed,and in long,thick
 grass and trees where they live. It is
 not unusual to see six together.      
 Rabbits  live in  similar  habitat but
 they like soft,sandy places for  their
 warrens.                              
 Roe deer like thick woodland for cover
 and privacy but more open land to feed
 on grass and leaves.                  
 The squirrels  of  this  area are red.
 They like  privacy  so  they  are  not
 often  seen.They  have a  dray made of
 sticks and twigs in a  deciduous tree.
 Foxes of this  area, although  rarely 
 seen, are  usually  red. They  appear 
 singly, living in thick  undergrowth, 
 eating rabbits.
