The summer of 1985 was an important and
historic time for the Baptist Church.  
The 14th April saw the enrolment of the
First West Haddon Company of the Boys  
Brigade. The Company was formed on 6th 
February 1985 and provided activities  
for boys aged 11 to 15.                
July also saw a new event for the      
Baptist Church. This was a week camp   
for children of the Sunday School and  
21 young people spent an enjoyable week
in a church hall at Cromer. In order to
raise funds for the camp many of the   
chidren took part in a snooker         
marathon, the children being divide    
into two teams and playing continuous  
snooker until one team reached 26      
frames. It took 23 hours.
