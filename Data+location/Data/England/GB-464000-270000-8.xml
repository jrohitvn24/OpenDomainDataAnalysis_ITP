		<content>Mr.R.D.van Millingen started Torque-   
meters Ltd in l95l.He had been testing 
engines of various kinds and felt there
was considerable need for improvement  
in this field.The firm started here as 
he was living in Ravensthorpe and      
premises were available.At that time   
optical torquemeters were used and     
although they were very accurate and   
efficient they required a number of    
skilled men to use them.Now they have  
moved on to a system that records the  
information automatically,so improving 
efficiency and reducing manpower.Firms 
are supplied world wide,each torque-   
meter is designed and custom built.l8  
people are employed including engineers
designers,turners,manufacturers,       
assembly,testing and office staff.For  
the future larger premises are the most
pressing need and even more modern     
methods of communication.              </content>
