		<content> The block is predominantly rolling    
 heather moorland but with extensive   
 conifer plantation in the west.   Keys
 Rock Road just touches the area so    
 there is vehicular access but other   
 roads are tracks used by forestry     
 workers and not open to the public.   
 There are some footpaths and the      
 remoteness of the area makes it       
 attractive to walkers, but roads are  
 bad so large numbers are visitors are 
 avoided.   The moorland has some use  
 as rough grazing for sheep and for    
 grouse shooting.   The extreme west   
 touches on the farming area of        
 Harcroft Beek Valley and is used for  
 mainly grazing.   The block is        
 uninhabited.
