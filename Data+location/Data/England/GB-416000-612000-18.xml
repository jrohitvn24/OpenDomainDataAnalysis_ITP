		<content> My dad works for a firm called        
 Sterling Winthrop.  He makes things   
 like medicines.  Sterling Winthrop is 
 near Cawledge View which is an estate 
 in Alnwick.  At dinner time he takes  
 an apple and his flask with coffee in 
 it.  Every year at Sterling Winthrop  
 there is a big party for children just
 before Christmas.  I got a racing     
 circuit, complete with two cars and   
 operated by batteres from a control   
 panel.  My brother got a radio with   
 batteries already in it.  Sterling    
 Winthrop is a drug company+ my dad    
 used to work for Boot's Drug Company  
 in Nottingham before he joined        
 Sterling Winthrop in Alnwick.         
 Sometimes he wears a white coat when  
 he is at work.  My dad goes to work on
 a bicycle, because the firm is near to
 our house or he takes a car.
