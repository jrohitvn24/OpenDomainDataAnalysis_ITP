		<title>17PORTHLEVEN COUNCIL BADGE</title>
		<content>    The Town Council badge is split    
 into quarters by an anchor. In one    
 quarter is the sun. It is on a black  
 background. A fishing boat is in the  
 next square.                          
    On the square below is St. Peter   
 standing at the edge of the sea       
 holding a fishing net with two fish   
 and one crab that have just dropped   
 out. In the fourth square is the clock
 tower with three black faces and one  
 white. This is the Bickford-Smith     
 Institute. Round the Institute is a   
 cobbled stone road. The pier is       
 pointing out towards the sea which is 
 white with black waves.               
    Round the outside of the badge is a
 rope which goes through a little round
 circle at the top of the anchor.      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
