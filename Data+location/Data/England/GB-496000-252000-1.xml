		<content> Stevington village is situated six    
 miles northwest of Bedford,the nearest
 town.It is a small village of about   
 two hundred and forty dwellings       
 some of which date back several       
 centuries.The population is just over 
 six hundred. The surrounding          
 countryside is farmed and consists    
 mainly of cornfields and grazing      
 land.The village is served by         
 a public bus service.The eighteenth   
 century windmill is a popular place   
 for sightseers.Only a few employment  
 situations exist within the           
 village,the majority of people        
 travelling further afield to work.The 
 nearest village is Bromham,two miles  
 east of Stevington.
