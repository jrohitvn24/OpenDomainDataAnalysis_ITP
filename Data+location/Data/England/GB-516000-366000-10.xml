		<title>10BUCKNALL SCHOOL - ACTIVITIES</title>
		<content> The desks are very modern being made  
 out of metal, plastic and are Formica 
 topped apart from a couple of desks   
 that are hopefully soon going to be   
 replaced.  The school goes on many    
 educational visits to Museums and the 
 like.  In the past few years we have  
 been to Hull Docks Museum, Crich      
 Tramway Museum, Kelham Island Museum  
 in Sheffield, Speedwell Cavern and    
 most recently we went to Lincoln City 
 F.C. and the Museum of Lincolnshire   
 Life although we are going to York    
 this year - to the National Railway   
 Museum and the Castle Museum.  We     
 haven't been yet.  We also have plays.
 These have included Robin Hood, Brer  
 Rabbit, a Circus, Wizards and Witches 
 and this year's - the longest we have 
 ever done - Charlie and the Chocolate 
 Factory. I have the leading role,     
 factory owner Willy Wonka.            </content>
