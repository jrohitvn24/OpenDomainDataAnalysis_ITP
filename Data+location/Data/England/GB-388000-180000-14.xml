		<content> Hullavington village is situated in a 
 rural part of Wiltshire, linked to its
 bigger towns by the A429 road.        
 Chippenham is approximately 15        
 kilometres south &amp; Malmesbury 10      
 kilometres north.The M4 Motorway runs 
 about 4 kilometres south of the       
 village &amp; is the link to London or the
 rest of the country.                  
   We were interested in the ways we   
 came to school. Of 94 children        
 questioned,15 came by car,1 by bus,13 
 on bicycles &amp; 65 children walked.The  
 family ownership of cars was high.    
 Ninety children had one family car &amp;  
 seventeen had two cars.Only four      
 families did not own a car. Three     
 children did not own a bicycle.       
   A railway line from Bristol to      
 London crosses the northern part of   
 the area, but Hullavington Station has
 been closed for many years.           </content>
