		<title>16KENWOOD HOUSE</title>
		<content> My name is Pamela O Carroll. I live   
 in Cricklewood NW9. One day my Mum and
 Dad decided to go somewhere nice,     
 because it was a beautiful day. My    
 family decided to go to{Hampstead     
{Heath.}We went by car and took a      
 picnic. It took five or ten minutes to
 get there. We got out of the car and  
 found somewhere to sit and play. We   
 decided to sit near a house called {  
{Kenwood House. }                      
  In this house there are paintings,   
 statues and other things. When we had 
 looked round we went into the cafe and
 bought a lolly. Then we went back to  
 our picnic and had someting to eat,   
 and then went home.{                  
  ({Kenwood House}was built in the 18th
 century for Lord Mansfield, in part by
{Robert Adam. }In 1928 it was given to 
 the nation by{Lord Iveagh}and is now a
 museum and art gallery. )             </content>
