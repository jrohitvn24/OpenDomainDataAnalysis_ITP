		<title>02EMPLOYMENT IN LAINDON</title>
		<content> We did a survey to find out where the 
 parents of the children in our school 
 work.Only a few actually work in      
 Laindon. Many people who live in      
 Laindon work in{London.} They{commute 
 to London everyday by train. People   
 also find work on the industrial sites
 in{Basildon.                          
 The main areas of{employment}in       
 Laindon are the shopping centre and   
 the new industrial site at            
{Southfields.}One of the new factories 
 is Gordon's Gin factory. It is one of 
 the largest bottling factories in     
 England.                              
 The advantage of the new industrial   
 site is that it will provide jobs.    
 However it is noisy and dirty and     
 there are not many jobs for young     
 people.
