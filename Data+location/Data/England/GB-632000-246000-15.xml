		<content> Most people in this area are Americans
 living at RAF Woodbridge. Unavoidably,
 their lives are insulated within thw  
 base and most people are very family  
 orientated. Even so, many like to get 
 off base to travel and sightsee. Eve- 
 nings are usually spent at home, some-
 times with friends, perhaps for a game
 of "Peaknuckle", a card game not known
 in England. At Christmas families usu-
 ally invite one of the single people  
 living on base to spend the day with  
 them. There is family support provided
 especially for young families who are 
 homesick. Most local people have rela-
 tives living nearby and visit at week-
 ends. Evenings might be spent at home,
 or perhaps at the local pub or evening
 class. This area is not particularly  
 fashion-conscious, clothes are usually
 country-casual and homes are tradi-   
 tionally furnished.                   </content>
