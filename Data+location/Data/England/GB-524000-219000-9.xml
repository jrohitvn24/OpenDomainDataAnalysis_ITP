		<title>09Age of Houses in Knebworth</title>
		<content> We surveyed the houses of the children
 of Knebworth school and received 157  
 replies. We asked the question "How   
 old is your house?" The replies were: 
    Up to one year              {1}    
    Between 1 and 10 years {    37     
    Between 10 and 50 years    {27     
    Between 50 and 100 years   {83}    
    Over 100 years          {    6}    
                               ___     
    Total                   {  154     
 We found by far that the most lived in
 houses were built between 50-100 years
 ago. However nearly as many lived in  
 houses built in the last 50 years. Few
 people live in houses built over 100  
 years ago because Knebworth has       
 rapidly developed this century. This  
 is probably because of the Railway    
 Station being built and more recently 
 because of the A1(M) motorway, both   
 giving access to London.              </content>
