		<content> This is a predominantly rural area    
 which has one large village in its{   
{North West}corner. Farmhouses and     
 cottages cluster together through the 
 area which is crossed by{narrow lanes}
 and two{major roads}running           
 North-South and East-West.The area    
 adjoins the old{Roman road}of{Stane   
{Street}but grew mainly after the      
 railway came in the 19thc. The        
 landscape gently undulates and has    
 little of the natural woodland present
 at the time of the first{Domesday}    
 survey. Buildings are a mixture of old
 (half-timbered or stone) and new      
 (brick and weatherboarding).          
                                       
 Many people commute to work to{London,
{Gatwick Airport or Horsham.}          
 Unemployment is low and the area has a
 prosperous feel.
