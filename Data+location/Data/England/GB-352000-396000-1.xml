		<content> This survey area mainly covers two    
 parts of{St Helens Metropolitan }     
{Borough;}all of Blackbrook and part of
 Haydock. Haydock was known in 1169 as 
 Hedoc and assumed its current spelling
 in 1286. The name probably originated 
 from the words Haidd (meaning barley) 
 and either Docce (plant) or Dokk      
 (hollow). Barley has been an important
 crop here for many centuries.         
 The importance of farming diminished  
 in the face of burgeoning industry,   
 having a striking effect on the       
 landscape.                            
 At one time Haydock was called        
 "Yickville" and its inhabitants were  
 "Yickers". It has also been described 
 as "part of Lancashire's unacceptable 
 backside: a nondescript left-over of  
 the Industrial Revolution",(Lancashire
 Life, April 1981).
