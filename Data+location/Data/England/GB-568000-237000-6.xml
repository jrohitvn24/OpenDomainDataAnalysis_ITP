		<title>06A FAMILY FIRM IN STAMBOURNE</title>
		<content>  The haulage company of E.A.Pyman &amp;   
 Sons was founded in 1936 by Mr.E.A.   
 Pyman. The main business in those days
 was with a cattle float carrying live-
 stock: most farms then had livestock. 
 During the war the land girls were    
 ferried about as well. Gradually, as  
 less farms had livestock and the farms
 became more arable, the emphasis in   
 haulage was towards grain. Today the  
 lorries carry bulk grain. Occasionally
 coal or animal feeds are carried.     
  The firm has 7 Volvo F7 lorries. Two 
 of these have 25 tonnes carrying      
 capacity, the others are 20 tonnes.   
 They carry the bulk grain from farm to
 either flour mills or Intervention    
 Store or to the docks.Nowadays,       
 carrying bulk grain is not seasonal.  
  They employ 7 drivers who live       
 locally. The longest serving driver   
 has worked for them for 8 years.      </content>
