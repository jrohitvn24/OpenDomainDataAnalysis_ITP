		<title>03Village of Wickhamford - one</title>
		<content>  The population of Wickhamford is 804.
 The main jobs of the villagers are    
 market gardening, farming and work in 
 local industry in Evesham.            
  The old part of the village consists 
 of a village hall, the church, the    
 manor, several thatched cottages and  
 other older houses. The new part has a
 small industrial estate and newer     
 houses. No new major developments are 
 planned. According to the village     
 plan, only infilling between existing 
 buildings will be allowed. An existing
 house is being converted into a       
 nursing home for the elderly.         
  The village hall is used for folk    
 dancing, 60+ club, gardening club,    
 discos and the playgroup meets there. 
  Children of school age attend Badsey 
 First School, then Blackminster Middle
 (about 2 miles away) and then The High
 School at Four Pools, Evesham.        </content>
