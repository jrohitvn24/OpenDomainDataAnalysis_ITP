		<content> T.S.B.is one of the main banks in     
 Gainsborough.It is situated on the    
 corner of Market Street and Heaton    
 Street.My Grandfather is called Mr    
 Walter Chadwick. He worked there as a 
 bank clerk for many years before he   
 retired in 1980. Most people have an  
 ordinary account pass book in which   
 all deposits and withdrawls are       
 recorded. Every year on November 20th 
 any interest.Which have been earned is
 added to their accounts. Some people  
 also have special deposit             
 accounts.Which pay extra interest.The 
 T.S.B.lends people money to help with 
 home improvements or car purchase.    
 Later this year the T.S.B. is due to  
 become privatised and people will be  
 able to buy shares in the bank.
