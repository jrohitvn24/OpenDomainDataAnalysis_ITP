		<title>01RANBY AND BABWORTH PARISH</title>
		<content>   The block situated between Ranby to 
 the east and Worksop to the west is   
 mainly in the Parish of Babworth.     
   Babworth is typical of the sand land
 parishes of West Nottinghamshire,     
 being large in area (6344 acres), and 
 dry. Its only natural water feature is
 the little River Ryton to the west of 
 the A1. There has been no mining or   
 industrial development and the block  
 remains almost entirely agricultural. 
   The village of Ranby is the only    
 significant settlement. Outside Ranby 
 the population tends to be grouped    
 round the farms, which often provide  
 accommodation for their workforce.    
   The farms are large, the largest    
 being 700 acres.                      
   Transport is a significant feature  
 with the A1 running parallel to the   
 old Great North Road.
