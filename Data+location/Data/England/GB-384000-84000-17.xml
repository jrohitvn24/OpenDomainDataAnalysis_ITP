		<title>17Holy Rood Church</title>
		<content> The Church is conveniently situated   
 in gently rising ground in the south  
 part of the village. (says Hutchins). 
 There is a tradition among the people 
 that some time ago it formed the      
 central point in the village.         
 New building developments have meant  
 that the church is now on the southern
 fringe of a rapidly expanding village.
 The growth of population in recent    
 years means that the 10.00 a.m. Family
 Eucharist is a lively affair, with    
 young children helping to fill the    
 church.                               
 There is a close link between the     
 Church and the Church of England Aided
 School.                               
 The majority of the School governors  
 are members of the Church.            
 The two church wardens and the Rector 
 help to maintain this close link      
 between Church and school.            </content>
