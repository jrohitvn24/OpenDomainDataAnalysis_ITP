		<title>10PAKEFIELD CARAVAN SITE</title>
		<content>Situated in grid square 53 89, this    
site is known as Pakefield Caravan Site
has been in existence for 20 years. On 
the site there are 339 {caravans} of   
which 319 are permanent and 20 are     
touring vans. At the time of the       
survey there were approximately        
600 people using the site.{Facilities} 
for the residents consist of a play    
area, swimming pool, a shop and        
organised entertainment.  There is a   
doctor, a bank, a public house, a bus  
service and shops within one mile of   
the site.  The site is situated at the 
end of Arbour Lane.  This is an        
interesting name for the road.  Some   
people say that it is evidence that,   
at one time, Pakefield had a harbour.  
Others suggest that its name should    
be, not Arbour Lane, but  Harvey Lane  
or Harvest Lane.  Arbour  Lane now     
leads only to the edge of the  cliff.  </content>
