		<content>  Councillors, Villagers and Builders  
 attended the opening of the new       
 lavatories in June.                   
  The lavatories in Broad Street Car   
 Park were built for Mid Sussex        
 District Council at a cost of Â£32,000.
 A copper map of Cuckfield commissioned
 by Cuckfield Neighbourhood Council was
 unveiled at the opening.              
  Ansty village has a new village sign.
 The original Jubilee Day sign erected 
 in 1977 went missing from the village 
 green almost a year ago. Oak posts    
 which surround the sign have been     
 replaced or repaired. Cuckfield Rural 
 Parish Council provided the funds for 
 the work.                             
  A book entitled 'Cuckfield in old    
 Picture Postcards' has just been      
 produced by Maisie Wright who lives in
 the village. The pictures used date   
 between 1882-1930. Price Â£6.95.       </content>
