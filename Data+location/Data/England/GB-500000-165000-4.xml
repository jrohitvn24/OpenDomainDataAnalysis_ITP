		<title>04ST. PETERS WITH ALL SAINTS</title>
		<content>      St. Peters Church is closely     
 linked with the Benedictine Abbey     
 founded in Chertsey in 666.  The      
 present church dates from l310        
 although only the tower and chancel   
 remain, the rest being rebuilt in     
 Gothic style in the l9th century.     
      During the l970's, the Anglicans,
 Congregationists and Methodists were  
 faced with extensive repairs so they  
 decided to share their resources.  The
 Methodist, United Reform church and   
 the Parish Hall were sold to help     
 finance work on the Parish Church     
 including an extension to serve as a  
 church hall.                          
      Although the three churches still
 hold seperate weekly services and     
 group meetings, there is shared       
 worship and joint Christian activites.
