		<title>05FAIRS AND GALAS -HORBURY</title>
		<content>  Horbury and South Ossett have been   
 swallowed up by the Wakefield         
 Metropolitan District Council and     
 Wakefield is the focal point for      
 local people's leisure and shopping   
 needs.                                
  The local area has maintained        
 traditional fairs and street          
 parades.In mid-June,1985 South Ossett 
 celebrated its 50' Children's Summer  
 Fair,whilst Horbury's Gala and Street 
 Fair was held on the same             
 day.Netherton and Middlestown also    
 hold annual gala's with stalls and    
 sideshows,competitions,marches and    
 musical entertainments.               
   Many local schools are involved or  
 hold their own galas.The money raised 
 is used to buy equipment for the      
 school.
