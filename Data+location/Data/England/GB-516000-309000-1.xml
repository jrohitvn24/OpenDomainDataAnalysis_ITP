		<title>01DEEPING ST JAMES</title>
		<content>     Deeping St. James is a very old   
 village.It is mentioned in the        
 Domesday book as Estdepinge. The river
 Welland runs though part of our block 
 separating Lincolnshire from Cambridge
 -shire.There are a lot of new housing 
 estates and a few old stone houses    
 some of which have been converted in  
 to modern homes.                      
     Our block includes only a small   
 part of the residential area of the   
 village, most of our block is farm-   
 land.Many of the people who live in   
 this village go to work in Peterboro- 
 gh which is only about 10 miles away. 
     The countryside around is very    
 flat and is mostly arable farm land.  
 There are four main farms.The oldest  
 church is the Priory church. On the   
 top of the Priory church is a cockerel
 which can be seen for miles around.
