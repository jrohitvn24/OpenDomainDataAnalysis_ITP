		<title>03LANDSCAPE, THEBERTON</title>
		<content> The landscape is flat, the fields at  
 harvest time a golden yellow are large
 though tree fringed, and it is an area
 where the sky is as dominant in the   
 landscape as the earth. There are     
 miles and miles flat as an airfield   
 and indeed it was used as such in the 
 last war. Mechanisation has enabled   
 the fields to be so large, and sadly  
 the tree lines show numbers of elms   
 reduced to their skeletons, ravaged by
 Dutch Elm disease or gaps where dead  
 elms have been removed. Although the  
 area has 25 ponds, 4 quite large, 3   
 almost mini-lakes, only a few are     
 visible from the roads. There are many
 footpaths, usually from farm to farm, 
 or farm to village, and those that do 
 not follow this pattern reach a single
 or dual track road soon to link up    
 with another footpath to a farmhouse  
 or farm.                              </content>
