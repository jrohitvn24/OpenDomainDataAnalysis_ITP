		<content>   To-day a team from our school played
a friendly football match at Little    
Harrowden Primary School.The football  
field is much smaller than ours and the
goal posts are also smaller. Tim our   
goal keeper knows the school well as   
his mum teaches there. A few times     
the ball went into the next field and  
it was full of cows. We went to get the
ball back.                             
  Oakway won the match 3 goals to two  
we enjoyed playing the game and hope   
to play a return match at Oakway.
