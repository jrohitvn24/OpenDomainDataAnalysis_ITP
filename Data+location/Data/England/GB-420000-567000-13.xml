		<content> Apart from a Jewish Reformed Synagogue
 the buildings for religious purposes  
 are linked to the{Christian faith;}two
 Catholic,two Church of England,one    
 Methodist,one United Reformed,one     
 Christian Fellowship,a gospel hall and
 a Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter
 Day Saints (Mormons).The traditional  
 churches tend to have{ageing          
{congregations}while the less formal   
 approach of the gospel hall tends     
 to be more attractive to the younger  
 people.A survey of{180 pupils}in a    
 Junior School (age 7-11) showed that  
{only 16 were regular attenders.       
  Apart from services of worship the   
 churches offer a{wide range of other  
{activities}throughout the week for    
 example Scouts,Guides and other social
 clubs. Among the Christian churches   
 there is a tendency to try to draw    
 together in{combined Christian faith. </content>
