		<title>15DESFORD BAND</title>
		<content> People like bands because they give an
 opportunity to meet different people  
 of their own age and interests.They   
 also give exciting entertainment.The  
 Desford band started at the turn of   
 the century but only changed its name 
 to the Desford Colliery Welfare Band  
 in 1956.At this time most of the      
 members were miners.                  
 The band also has tuition for younger 
 people and a junior band.That means   
 nearly 100 people are involved in     
 making music.This thriving and        
 successful band has won the Granada   
 Band competition for the past four    
 years.
