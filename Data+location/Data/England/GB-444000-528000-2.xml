		<title>02FARMING, CROPS &amp; BUILDINGS</title>
		<content> Most of our area is taken up with     
 farms - the Stotfold Farms to the west
 and the Brierton Farms to the east. In
 June, when the area was researched,   
 many of the fields contained crops -  
 for the most part barley and wheat.   
 Some fields were a colourful yellow on
 account of the popular oil seed rape. 
 Also grown are potatoes, turnips, and 
 grass for hay and silage. Much of the 
 equipment on the farms is tied to this
 kind of farming. We saw tractors,     
 combined harvesters, diggers, balers  
 and seed drills. The buildings also   
 reflected arable farming. At one farm 
 the old barns had not been big enough 
 so grain bins had been constructed.   
 Over the years the bins also proved to
 be too small and now a huge barn is   
 under construction to take 6,000 tons 
 of grain after this year's harvest.
