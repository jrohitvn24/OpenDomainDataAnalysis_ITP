		<title>15STOCKPORT: REDDISH VALE.</title>
		<content>   I like to play in{Reddish Vale.}The 
 vale is part of the{Tame Valley}and   
 has lots of grass and woods and there 
 is a river winding through.           
   The vale has rope swings and dirt   
 paths which we slide down. It is a    
 place where we can play without       
 getting into trouble.                 
   I like playing on the river swing   
 best because it is daring. Sometimes  
 people fall in and get very wet. We   
 make dens out of branches from the    
 trees and cover them with things like 
 cardboard and sheets of metal.        
   The vale also has footpath slides   
 which are steep paths covered in dust 
 - great for wearing out your trousers 
 as you slide down pretending to be    
 skiing.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
