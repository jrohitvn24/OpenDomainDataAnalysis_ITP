AKELEY &amp; LILLINGSTONE DAYRELL          
                                       
The area is peppered with farmhouses,  
some large, some small, only one is of 
1980 vintage.  Akeley has local author-
ity houses, but many of these are pri- 
vately owned.  Buckingham University   
own property for rent in L. Dayrell and
there are several bungalows and houses 
in this hamlet owned by Squire Robarts 
and his tenant farmer.  In Akeley there
is a mixed development of old cottages,
post war houses, new first time homes  
which are very small and large archi-  
tect designed dwellings built on excess
garden land sold to developers.  There 
is no gas laid to the villages; heating
is by solid fuel, electricity, oil or  
calor gas.
