		<content> The engine provides the power to turn 
 the car wheels. Most cars have their  
 engines in the front. But some cars   
 have the engine at the back. The      
 engine power comes from burning a     
 mixture of petrol and air in closed   
 spaces called cylinders. Most car     
 engines have four or six cylinders in 
 a straight line, some are in the shape
 of a V. Inside each cylinder is a     
 piston rather like an upturned barrel 
 which can move up and down.  A gas is 
 produced by the burning fuel to push  
 the piston. The pistons are connected 
 to the crank shaft and force it round.
 From the crank shaft the turning      
 motion is carried to the driving      
 wheels by the transmition system.This 
 is how an engine works.
