		<title>11Shops in Fletchertown.</title>
		<content> My Mam and Dad rent a shop from Mr    
 and Mrs Armstrong.We go to the'Cash   
 and Carry' to buy our stock on        
 Mondays and Thursdays.These are some  
 of the best sellers at our shop;frozen
 drinks,sweets,crisps,ice lollies,     
 because the children like to buy them.
 Our shop used to be a Post Office and 
 that is why it's got a wooden counter 
 right round,wooden shelves at the back
 and a window for display.There is a   
 store room at the back that leads into
 my auntie Eves shop. That used to be a
 Fish and Chip shop,but she just uses  
 it to store things in now.We also     
 sell,fruit,cakes,tins of food and many
 other things people might need.       
 There is also a Post Office in the    
 other food shop in Fletchertown.It    
 moved there in 1935.Mrs. Henderson    
 works in the Post Office and she also 
 owes the shop.                        </content>
