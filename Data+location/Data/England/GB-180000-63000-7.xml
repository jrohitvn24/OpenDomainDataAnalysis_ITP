		<title>07FISHING IN WATERGATE BAY 2</title>
		<content> When caught the fishermen put the     
 Mackerel in a bucket and wait for them
 to die. Then the heads and tails and  
 guts are cut into slices to use as    
 bait,their heads, tails and guts are  
 thrown overboard for the blood to     
 attract fish,although the seagulls get
 quite a lot The boats used sonar to   
 find the fish and when we found a     
 shoal we dropped anchor and baited our
 rods. The sonar told us the depth to  
 find the fish and we dropped our lines
 and slowly wound them in. Everyone    
 caught a fish the heaviest fish was a 
 Ray of 13lb, Pollack was most         
 frequently caught although we also    
 caught Lemon Sole, Conger Eels, Cod,  
 Munkfish and Angler fish. Steven      
 Boxell caught a rubber dingy which had
 drifted out from the beach. A Conger  
 Eel almost caught him when it pulled  
 him off the boat trying to escape.    </content>
