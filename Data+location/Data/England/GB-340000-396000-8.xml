		<title>08Semi Detached House: Kirkby</title>
		<content> My name is Jane. I live in a semi     
 detached house with 3 bedrooms. Our   
 house has 8 rooms altogether. We have 
 a single garage. Since moving here we 
 have had an extension built on to the 
 kitchen. We have a back garden and a  
 front garden.                         
 Inside the house we have a gas fire   
 and gas central heating and we have an
 electric cooker.                      
 Our house is about 22 years old.      
 Facing the house is a field and at the
 back are other semi detached houses.  
 In our street there 29 trees and 4    
 shops: a hairdresser's, a newsagent's,
 a pet shop and a motor shop. There is 
 also a telephone box which is not     
 vandalised but only works for 999     
 calls.                                
 My parents chose to move here because 
 they knew the area well and it was    
 near relatives.                       </content>
