		<content>{The Vineries}is a nursery in Lambs    
 Green.Flower and vegetable plants are 
 raised and are sold to shops in       
 Crawley and to customers who come to  
 the nursery.There are several plastic 
 greenhouses,one of which is heated,   
 and a total of 5 acres of land.The    
 owners Mr and Mrs Shaw do all the work
 themselves without any employees,     
 which involves a very early start to  
 the day in the summer when watering   
 has to be carried out.There is an 18  
 foot deep well which never dries up,  
 and this can be used for watering in  
 times of drought.Runner beans and     
 marrows are grown to maturity and the 
 produce sold through local shops.
