		<title>13A PUBLIC HOUSE IN BLACKBURN</title>
		<content>      The landlord of the Rock Inn,    
 Tockholes, Blackburn, has been living 
 in this former farmhouse for seven    
 years since moving from the           
 industrialised area of Bury.          
      The pub belongs to Thwaites      
 Brewery, meaning the landlord must buy
 all beers and spirits from them. Mixer
 drinks and cigarettes can be bought   
 elsewhere as a result of a recent EEC 
 ruling.                               
      The pub's opening times are      
 11a.m. to 3p.m. and 5.30p.m. to 11p.m.
 Meals, such as pies and chips, are    
 served every day except Monday. This  
 new idea has boosted the number of    
 people coming into the pub. Most of   
 the regulars are over 20 years of age,
 the majority travel to the pub by car 
 but others walk. Fewer customers      
 frequent the pub in winter because    
 snow blocks the approach road.        </content>
