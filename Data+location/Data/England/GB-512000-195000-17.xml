 Letchmore Heath is a small village    
 situated on the outskirts of          
 Watford. It is made up mainly of      
 expensive detatched properties and    
 cottages. These houses are basically  
 found along the two roads which make  
 up Letchmore Heath. The  tranquil and 
 beautifully kept. It has won many     
 local competitions. There is a        
 village green with a war memorial, a  
 small pond,and the village is         
 surrounded by fields. Once one leaves 
 the village the roads revert          
 to lanes. However this quiet little   
 retreat is just five minutes away from
 the M1 motorway and just seventeen    
 miles from London.Clearly then it is  
 well placed for commuters.
