		<content>    At Grizedale there is a Theatre,   
 campsite, tree nursery, museum and a  
 Forestry Commission Office.           
                                       
    {The campsite}has been open for 23 
 years, it accommodates 60 tents. Dutch
 people like camping at Grizedale      
 because it is nice and quiet. It costs
 adults Â£1.50 per night. If you want to
 see the area you can hire a bike. The 
 campsite is on the site of the old    
 Grizedale Hall which was demolished in
 1957.                                 
                                       
    {The Theatre in the Forest}dates   
 from 1969 and has plays, dancing,     
 jazz, classical and folk music, and   
 talks. The average price of tickets is
 about Â£2.00 per person. The Theatre   
 Trust has over 1000 members, and they 
 hope that their theatre will continue 
 to be used for many years.            </content>
