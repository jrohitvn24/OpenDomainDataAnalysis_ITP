		<title>14AVENUE CENTRE, HAMPTON WICK</title>
		<content> The{Avenue Centre}in Normansfield     
 Avenue, Hampton Wick, is a centre for 
 mentally handicapped people.  One     
 hundred and thirty six students go to 
 the centre from 9am to 4pm, Monday to 
 Friday.  The students are aged from   
 sixteen to sixty five years old.      
 Students are taught to do things that 
 they need to be able to do at home    
 like cooking, bathing and hair        
 washing.  The students do lots of     
 activities in workshops.  Some of the 
 activities they do are pottery,       
 rugmaking, candlemaking, carpentry,   
 metalwork and woodwork.  Once a week  
 students and counsellors meet to      
 discuss their activities and how they 
 are getting on in the centre.         
 Everybody who is there enjoys their   
 day.
