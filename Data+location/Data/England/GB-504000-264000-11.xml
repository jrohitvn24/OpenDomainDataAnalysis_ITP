		<content> Manor Farm is a red brick over timber 
 frame house dating from 1600, with    
 adjustments and additions to the      
 present day.                          
 The owners have decided to branch into
 the bed and breakfast business. 1985  
 is their 3rd year and each year their 
 success grows. There are two rooms    
 available for letting. Guests can     
 enjoy staying in the peace and quiet  
 of Swineshead knowing that they are in
 easy reach of main tourist areas.     
 The business is registered with the   
 English Tourist Board and the AA and  
 also with a new group that has been   
 formed this year called the           
 Bedfordshire Farm and Country Holiday 
 Group.                                
 Guests come from as far afield as     
 India, America and Australia and      
 getting nearer to home Keysoe.
