		<title>04LIME QUARRY</title>
		<content> The lime quarry was opened in 1830    
 when the Southampton to Andover Canal 
 was dug.  It was owned by the canal   
 company with the lime used for the    
 construction of the canal.  When the  
 Andover to Southampton railway was    
 built, much of the canal was filled   
 in and the railway laid on top.       
 The lime quarry was bought from the   
 railways when the line closed in the  
 1960s, by a private contractor.       
 At present 1000 _ 1500 tons of lime   
 is extracted each year.  Most is used 
 as a base for road_works, some for    
 agricultural use.  Some of the flints 
 in the chalk are used for wall        
 building.  The chalk used to be       
 blasted out; as this is no longer     
 allowed a 360 degrees hydraulic slew  
 machine is used which has a metre cut.
