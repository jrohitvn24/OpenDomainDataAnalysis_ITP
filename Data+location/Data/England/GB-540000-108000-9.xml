		<content>      Suddenly my sister rushed into   
 the room. The bleep alarm on my radio 
 had not gone off, it was 7.45am, I    
 would be late for school. I jumped out
 of bed,dressed in black trousers, blue
 shirt, grey sweater and stuffed a     
 striped school tie in my pocket. After
 a rushed breakfast of cereal,         
 scrambled eggs and toast, I brushed my
 teeth, shoved on my trainers, grabbed 
 my rucksack of school books, and my   
 friends and I cycled to school on our 
 BMX bikes.                            
      Lessons that day,after morning   
 assembly,were Design,PE (tennis),     
 history (the Romans), mathematics     
 (learning computer use) and French.   
 School dinner was pizza and chips,    
 with an apple.                        
      Home to homework and a walk with 
 the dog.Supper was chicken and veg.   
 Then I saw a TV show until 9.30-BED!  </content>
