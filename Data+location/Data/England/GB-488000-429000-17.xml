     Every day 803 litres of milk go to
 the dairy.  Once every 2 weeks the    
 cows have a medical check up.  Every 4
 weeks they are checked by the Milk    
 Marketing Board.  The milking parlour 
 is a 5/10 herringbone parlour.        
     On the farm between 2 to 3 litters
 of pigs are born every week.  These   
 pigs are bred for pork and bacon and  
 they are supplied to the prison       
 service.                              
     The prison service is self        
 sufficient.  Any excess is sold and   
 the income is used to buy any foods   
 the farms do not produce.
