 owned by Mr Brian Blacker(son).       
 Designed by Alfred Waterhouse,it was  
 built in 1870 in the Gothic style by  
 the Rev George Horsley-Palmer, the    
 Brother of Earl of Selborne, a nearby 
 village. The family have lived there  
 from 1940.Until the Enclosures Act  of
 1856, the farmland which now surrounds
 the house was forest and yielded only 
 clay for a local brick factory.Remains
 of this still exist.The farm covers   
 about 100 acres,50 acres grazing and  
 woodland, 50 acres crops. Coldhayes is
 open to the public, and the gardens   
 are a local tourist attraction.       </content>
