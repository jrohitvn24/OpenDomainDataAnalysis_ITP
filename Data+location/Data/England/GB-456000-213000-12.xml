		<title>12THE OTMOOR REVEIW</title>
		<content>The Otmoor Reveiw is a type of Otmoor  
Newspaper. It is produced by our       
teacher and printed with a duplicator. 
It has things to do with the village   
life and stuff to buy. People put      
advertisements in it. The first page   
usually has a picture someone from our 
school has drawn. The next page is the 
church page. It is by Mr Wainwright.It 
has dates for services. Sometimes      
there are poems and things about the   
school. There are always nature notes  
which Mr Ushaw has written. In the     
village some women have formed a       
Village Institute and their news is    
there. Sometimes there are Councillor's
notes about the local buildings in the 
village and other places around.       
Some of the children from our school   
deliver it. The Otmoor Reveiw is not a 
newspaper because it is only published 
once a month.                          </content>
