		<content> Mr and Mrs Kara run a general store in
 Station Road, Thatcham to provide a   
 service for the local people when     
 central Thatcham shops are closed.    
 The opening hours are 8_8 pm Monday to
 Saturday ,9_2 pm on Sunday. The shop  
 is busy when the Kennet pupils go to  
 school and in the afternoon when they 
 come home.                            
 Mr Kara sells stamps and has a postbox
 in the shop. Some of the customers    
 come nearly every day, as they like   
 the shop being open long hours on     
 Sundays when the bigger shops are     
 closed. People come from all around to
 go to the shop. We interviewed several
 people from Longbridge Road. One man  
 came from Andover. Mr Kara doesn't    
 think he will lose them when the new  
 shops nearby are built since, if the  
 food is always fresh he will get his  
 customers.                            </content>
