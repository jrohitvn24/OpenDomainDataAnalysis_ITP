		<content> Sunday:_                              
 We get up at 9 o'clock and get ready  
 for church, which starts at 10a.m. We 
 have a quick breakfast oftea and toast
 then we drive to church. Meanwhile Dad
 has a lie in, takes our dog for a walk
 and does any odd jobs until we get    
 back about 12.15 p.m. Mum cooks a late
 breakfast-lunch, bacon, eggs,         
 mushrooms and coffee. We play out in  
 the garden with our friends or        
 relatives, usually Nanna and Grandad. 
 When we go ther we see quite a few    
 people because my Great Grandma lives 
 with them and my Aunt and Uncle and   
 three cousins live next door. We play 
 rounders or play in our den at the    
 bottom of our garden. We have tea with
 nanna and then come home, have a      
 shower, read a book then go to bed at 
 about 9.00 p.m.                       
                                       </content>
