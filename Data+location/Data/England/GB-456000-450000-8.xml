		<content>{ Priory Street Centre}was originally a
 school,now it is a Sports Centre.It   
 was opened as a school in 1857.The    
 school remained under Methodist       
 management until it was closed in     
 1948.                                 
{ Bowls}is a game for two or more      
 players.The idea of the game is to get
 nearest to the Jack,the white         
 ball.Points are given to the team that
 has the nearest bowls to the Jack.Only
 one team can score points at a time.  
{ Dancing.}I do ballet lessons.I am in 
 grade 4 now.I do Latin American and   
 Ballroom dancing.In Latin American we 
 dance to modern records and in        
 Ballroom to old-fashioned.I do drama  
 and Jazz dance.In drama you have to   
 express feelings.Jazz dance is        
 movement to strongly rythmic music.
