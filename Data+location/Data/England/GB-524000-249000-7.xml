		<title>07THE COCKAYNE FAMILY</title>
		<content>     The emblem of the Cockayne family,
 the main landowners from Medieval     
 times onward, is the cockerel. It can 
 be seen on several of the graves      
 including the stones in front of the  
 altar, commemorating the last four    
 Cockayne's to be buried in the church.
 Because of the 1806 Restoration       
 however, there are no cockerels in any
 other part of the church. Previously  
 there must have been since, when the  
 West Window of the church was         
 restored and it was discovered money  
 could be saved by filling in a section
 hidden by the organ with old pieces of
 stained glass, one section shows      
 several red cockerels. Other sections 
 show odd pieces of arms and legs. It  
 is interesting to see.
