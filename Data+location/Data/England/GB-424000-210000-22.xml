<title>22Burford Visitor Information Centre 2011</title>
<content>

Burford's visitor Information Centre (Tourist Office) moved from Sheep Street to the bottom end of the High Street in 2011.  &lt;br />&lt;br />Here visitors from nearby and far afield are given advice on the sites and sights in and around the historic town of Burford together with recommendations for suitable accommodation, walks and activities. Details of visits to historic houses, gardens and wildlife parks in the area and  information on buses and trains are available at the office. Local accommodation bookings can be arranged and the office carries information on tourist attractions in many of the surrounding towns and villages. &lt;br />&lt;br />Burford is popular with visitors all through the year and especially during the summer months. Many people come to see the Grade I listed Church (one of the finest in the country), the Tolsey Museum, the Town's many ancient inns and its fine Cotswold buildings and rolling countryside.   &lt;br />
