		<content>    Brian Brown has been a docker for  
{12 years}now.He works 8 hours day     
 shift and 8 hours night shift but he  
 changes shifts weekly.He is part of a 
 gang of men and is employed as a      
{shipworker}along with three           
 others, four tug drivers,two crane    
 drivers,one cargo planner and a       
 superviser.A tug is a one seated lorry
 with a side engine."We have to load   
 and unload containers and machinery," 
 he said."Once we have had helicopters 
 to load which I think was our most    
 unusual object.I take off the stackers
 and help to hook the crane to the     
 containers."                          
    When asked about{expansion}to the  
 docks he said that there was an       
 argument each way."It will supply more
{jobs,}give greater security to the    
 workers and increase Felixstowe's     
 population."                          </content>
