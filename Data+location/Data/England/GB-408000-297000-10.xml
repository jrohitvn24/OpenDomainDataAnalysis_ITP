		<content> More than half our mothers work       
 outside the home,but that doesnot mean
 our fathers do more jobs to help. Some
 fathers do share the household jobs   
 but it is mostly the mothers wo do the
 washing, washing up, ironing, cooking 
 and shopping. Machines give mothers   
 time to go to work.Every family,except
 one, has a washing machine.That one   
 mother uses the launderette           
 instead.About half of our families    
 have a  dishwasher,and over a third   
 have a microwave cooker.Family        
 Holidays in this country are more     
 popular than abroad.About half our    
 families own either a caravan, a boat 
 or a holiday home.A few have villas   
 abroad. Diaries were kept over a Bank 
 Holiday weekend and a lot of families 
 went away. The others had family days 
 out. Visiting Sutton Park,picnics and 
 barbeques were expecially popular.    </content>
