		<title>11FARMING-ARMTHORPE AREA</title>
		<content>  In this area the{majority of farming 
 is done by two farmers,one a private  
 owner and the other a manager.The     
 farming is{highly mechanised}so there 
 is only a small workforce,which is    
 supplemented by casual labour when    
 required.                             
  The farms have an{average size}of 360
 acres.Approximately 400 acres have    
 been lost  to farming due to{tipping }
 of waste from the local colliery.In   
 some parts the land has dropped as    
 much as 3'due to the mining in the    
 area.                                 
  The farming is predominantly arable. 
 The{crops}are grown in a mixture of   
 sandy and loam soils and consist of   
 wheat,barley,potatoes,peas and sugar  
 beet.This type of farming has been    
 chosen purely  for economic reasons.  
  Farmers have not noticed any changes 
 in animal &amp; plant life in the area.   </content>
