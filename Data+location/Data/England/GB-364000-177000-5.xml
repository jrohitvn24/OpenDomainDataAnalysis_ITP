 live in houses but we found some lived
 in flats ,caravans,cottages, bungalows
 and farms.The majority of the homes   
 in this area were built in the 1960's,
 they are semidetached and built of    
 bricks .There seems to be a{majority  
 of{privately owned houses}but there   
 are{many council houses}which are     
 rented by families.

 things in a home are powered by       
{ELECTRICITY,}90% of the people own    
{washing machines,}38% have{computers, 
 30% own{microwave ovens.
