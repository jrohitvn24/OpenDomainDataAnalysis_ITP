		<title>01NW from Wincanton, Somerset</title>
		<content> A section of landscape which is       
 typical of SE Somerset. Rolling       
 verdant hills, a patchwork of smallish
 fields most of them outlined by       
 healthy hedgerows containing many good
 trees, is the overall impression. The 
 lanes are narrow and twisting and     
 meander across the area between high  
 hedgerows. The land, for the most     
 part, is well cultivated but there are
 a few small pockets of rough ground   
 fit only for grazing. There is some   
 woodland and, closer to the town, a   
 horticultural nursery is doing well.  
 We have a National Hunt racecourse    
 which, with its attendant good        
 facilities, serves both the local and 
 area needs. It has a Function Suite   
 and touring caravan site. It is also  
 used as the town's "open space" for   
 markets, fund-raising, walking the dog
 etc.                                  </content>
