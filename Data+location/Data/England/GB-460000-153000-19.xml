 Hall with the adjacent Village Green, 
 Working Mens Club and the recently    
 extended and refurbished Swan Inn     
 provide the main focus of community   
 and social activities.  For the       
 younger residents there is a          
 Playgroup, Brownie and Cub packs      
 and a Guide Company. The Recreation   
 Ground has tennis courts, football and
 cricket pitches and a childrens       
 playground.  There are many walks     
 through the woodlands and footpaths   
 throught the countryside.  There is a 
 nine holed golf course at Basingstoke 
 District Hospital. The Hospital has   
 social clubs and some of the          
 industries do too. The Caribbean Club 
 on the Houndsmill Estate caters for   
 the West Indian population of         
 Basingstoke. There are also social    
 clubs on the housing estates.         </content>
