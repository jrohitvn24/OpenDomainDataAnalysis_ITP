 This block is mostly rural. Its main  
 concentrations of population are in   
 the small village of Stretton Sugwas, 
 a small part of the larger village of 
 Credenhill, and part of the urban     
 development of Hereford City westwards
 along the main A438 road from Hereford
 to Brecon. Other houses are situated  
 singly, such as farmsteads, or in     
 small groups. The block is bisected   
 east/west by the A438 road and        
 includes in the SW corner a stretch of
 the River Wye, here running mainly    
 N/S. The block is largely             
 agricultural, with fertile soil formed
 from glacial deposits from the melting
 Wye glacier. Some of the land is owned
 by the Prudential Assurance Company   
 and rented to various tenants.
