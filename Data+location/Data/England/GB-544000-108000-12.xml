		<title>12A FARM-HOUSE NEAR GLYNDE</title>
		<content> Newhouse Farm is part of several other
 farms outside the area. The farmer's  
 father bought it in 1911 and he was   
 born there. The front of the house is 
 Georgian. The back is older and a     
 newer part was built onto it not long 
 ago. The 6 year old girl showed us her
 skewbald pony and 2 orphan lambs. They
 have 2 dogs and some doves. The main  
 interest of this farm is milking. We  
 were shown the milking parlour where  
 the cows are fed as they are milked.  
 We drank some cold fresh milk from a  
 large metal container. Lastly we were 
 shown the combine harvester. It looked
 bigger in a barn than it does working 
 in the fields.
