		<content> Two years ago miners at Sarlston pit  
 were working underneath the village.  
 Lots of buildings suffered from       
 subsidence. One house had to be held  
 up with a wooden frame. Our school was
 badly damaged. Walls cracked, the     
 floors in the library and staffroom   
 lifted, doors and windows would not   
 shut and the roof began to leak.      
 Workmen came in to mend the damage and
 were here for over a year. All the    
 classes kept having to move rooms     
 whilst all the plaster was replaced.  
 The infants corridor was closed off   
 and a new wall and floor was put in.  
 After the builders had finished the   
 school was repainted cream white and  
 brown. Now workmen are in again       
 putting in new pipes and radiators and
 a new boiler. Men are also working on 
 the roof.                             
                                       </content>
