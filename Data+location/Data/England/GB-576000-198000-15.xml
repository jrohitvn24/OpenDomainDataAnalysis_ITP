		<title>15Woodham Ferrers Transport</title>
		<content> The main form of transport in the     
 village is the motor car. Most        
 families have at least one &amp; many have
 2 or more. Road tax is Â£90 pa. The    
 average price of a gallon of petrol is
 Â£1.95. The building of the new        
 town of South Woodham 2\ miles to     
 the south of the old village an       
 enormous increase in the volume of    
 traffic has resulted. Many village    
 residents have complained about the   
 noise and hope a bypass may be built  
 in the future. The bus service through
 the area is infrequent and expensive  
 as it costs over two pounds to        
 Chelmsford. An electricfied rail link 
 direct to Liverpool Street is planned.
 Average price of a family car is      
 Â£5000. Motorcycles are still popular  
 with young people and training schemes
 operate. The bicycle is still a       
 favourite with young children.        </content>
