		<title>13INDUSTRY IN THE CRAY VALLEY</title>
		<content>Most {industry} within the Orpington   
area is to be found along the valley   
of the {River Cray}. Originally the    
paper industry was located here but    
today an industrial estate is found    
along the main road which runs down    
the Cray Valley. Industry today is no  
longer associated with the river. Many 
of the factories have been replaced by 
large {discount stores} attracted by   
the large local residential population 
and good communications.
