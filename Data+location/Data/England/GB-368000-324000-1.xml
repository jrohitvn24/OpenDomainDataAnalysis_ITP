		<content>  This is an area dominated by farming 
 and its related small industries.The  
 landscape is the traditional English  
 field system bordered by predominantly
 hawthorn hedges over rolling lowlands.
  The farming is mainly arable. There  
 are scattered dairy farms, battery    
 chicken and pig units.                
  The population has not greatly       
 changed in recent years.The numbers at
 Hinstock school have hovered around   
 70 since the war.Many of the          
 families have links that go back for  
 generations. Expansion of the living  
 accomodation is limited because there 
 is no mains sewerage in the area
