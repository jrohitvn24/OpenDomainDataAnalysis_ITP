		<title>14PANSHANGER GOLF CLUB</title>
		<content> I go to Panshanger golf club.I go on  
 the pitch and putt.It is a 9 hole     
 course and it doubles back at the     
 6th.There are not many bunkers but on 
 the 6th there is one that goes        
 straight across the green.I do not    
 like the 6th because it has tight     
 trees on one side.The first second and
 third are nice short holes.The longest
 hole I think is the 8th because it has
 a short dogleg.I play with my dad.It  
 takes about 20mins to go round.I play 
 with my own clubs.Sometimes the greens
 are not good because the greenkeeper  
 tries to get the greens good for the  
 summer.Sometimes there are temporary  
 greens that are no good. I can not    
 putt very well.
