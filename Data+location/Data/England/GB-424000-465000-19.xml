 It was originally a grange of         
 Fountains Abbey and was farmed by the 
 monks with one lay brother and the    
 others were workers.It is mentioned in
 the original Domesday Book.The stones 
 of Haddockstones which were laid down 
 by ancient man were moved and the site
 destroyed when a natural_gas pipeline 
 which lies under the farm in a        
 north_south route,was laid in 1967/68.
 It is now a dairy farm of 162 acres   
 with 95 cows _ 80 milkers.They grow   
 silage and hay.Feed is bought from    
 Bibby's at Sherburn-in-Elmet.The cows 
 are brought in around mid_October and 
 put out again in April.The older      
 heifers stay out until Christmas.The  
 animals are all home reared.Pannal    
 Auction Mart is to sell animals.
