		<title>03Townscape - a child's view.</title>
		<content>{Woodbridge}is a lovely place. It has a
 river which most towns don't have.    
 There are swans on the river and      
 sometimes people feed them. Across the
 river is{Sutton Hoo}where a Viking    
 ship was buried. Some people sit and  
 paint the river and the lovely view.  
 It is nice to go to the{Riverside     
{Theatre}with its new blue seats which 
 came from France and you can pop in   
 there for a coffee. It is fun at the  
{Deben Swimming Pool.}There are lovely 
 places for children to play like{Fen} 
{Meadow, Kingston Field and Elmhurst } 
{Park.}In winter we sledge down the    
 Fen. Many little grocer's shops have  
 been replaced by supermarkets. There  
 are now lots of antique shops and     
 Building Society Offices. The library 
 has a children's section and you can  
 borrow music and story tapes.
