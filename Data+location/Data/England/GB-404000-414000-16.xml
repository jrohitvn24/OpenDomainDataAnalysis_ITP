		<title>16SCAMMONDEN BRIDGE AND M62.</title>
		<content> Scammonden Bridge is the largest      
 single-span fixed-arch bridge in Great
 Britain.Built in 1971,it has a span of
 120 metres and a deck 200 metres long 
 which carries the A6025 Elland to     
 Buckstones road across the Deanhead   
 Cutting 36 metres above the M62       
 motorway.The bridge is built to       
 withstand the severest Pennine weather
 conditions where windspeeds can reach 
 100mph.It was computer designed to    
 give an economic yet graceful shape.  
     The section of the M62 motorway   
 which traverses the northern border of
 our block,was officially opened by the
 Queen in 1971.It crosses the rugged   
 mountainous Pennines through some of  
 the most impressive landscape in      
 Britain.Daunting construction problems
 and weather conditions had to be over-
 come.At peak times,the M62 carries 14-
 15000 vehicles an hour.               </content>
