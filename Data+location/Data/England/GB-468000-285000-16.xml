		<content>  On the day chosen,May 9th 1985,the   
 weather was warm and slightly windy.  
 Four accessible 'stations' were chosen
 on the north bank. At each 'station'  
 we{pond-dipped.                       
  To dip, we put the net gently into   
 the water and moved it from side to   
 side for about 1 to 2 minutes. Dips   
 were taken in open water, reeds and   
 mud. Then we took the net out and     
 emptied it inside out into a          
 water-filled bucket. To see what we   
 had, we waited 5 to 10 minutes for    
 the water to clear.{The results of the
{dip are shown on the next page.       
  While we were pond-dipping, we made  
 several bird observations and these   
 are also listed with the water        
 specimens.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
