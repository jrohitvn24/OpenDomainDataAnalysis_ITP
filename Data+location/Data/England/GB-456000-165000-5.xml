		<content>   Woolhampton school is on a hill     
 next to a church. We have four        
 classrooms, one dinner and P.E. hall, 
 one kitchen and two offices for the   
 headteacher and the secretary.        
 We  have a new library  with lots of  
 interesting books  which was opened on
 Tuesday the 18th June 1985 by a school
 governor, Miss Blythe-Currie who is   
 eighty six.                           
   Children start school at  five years
 old and leave primary school at eleven
 years old and go to secondary school. 
 most children go to Kennet School.    
 we have a needle work teacher called  
 Mrs Weight and she is very kind she   
 makes lots of toys and clothes for    
 herself.                              
   Last year a new head teacher        
 come to our school and her name is Mrs
 Brownjohn. Mrs Whitehead and Mrs Bunce
 left the school.                      </content>
