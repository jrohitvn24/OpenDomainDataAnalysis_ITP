		<title>18Nether Stowey:Leisure - 1</title>
		<content> As Nether Stowey is a rural area it is
 not surprising that many people enjoy 
 gardening as their main hobby. Walking
 is also a popular pastime in such a   
 beautiful location whilst others enjoy
 photography. Horse riding on the hills
 and along the lanes provides pleasure 
 for some and there are riding stables 
 in the village. Some locals regard fox
 and stag hunting as their recreation. 
 A lot of people enjoy reading and use 
 the village library. Home computers   
 are still a minority interest. Wine   
 making, cookery and knitting are      
 popular. A good number of families    
 enjoy music and sport, and for others 
 television is their only interest.
