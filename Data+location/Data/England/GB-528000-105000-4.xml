		<content> A common pastime during a normal      
 evening is to watch Television        
 pogrammes at home. Apart from         
 favourite regular programmes people   
 also make use of Video Cassette       
 recordings, by means of which they can
 watch a special programme _ a very    
 long film which is the story of a     
 book. People can also make a          
 recording of a programme whilst they  
 are away from the Television set _ the
 machine will switch itself on, record 
 a programme and switch itself on,     
 record a programme and switch off at  
 pre_set times. Thus, whilst you mat   
 wish to see a particular programme,   
 but also need to attend a function    
 whilst the programme is being         
 broadcast, the video will record a    
 programme so that you may view it     
 sometime later.
