		<title>19BIRDS IN KETTLEWELL</title>
		<content>   Apart from the usual common birds in
 the village, dippers, herons, and     
 occasionally kingfishers, are found   
 near the river.  Goosanders and       
 oyster-catchers breed regularly by the
 river.  Grey and yellow wagtails are  
 found, but sand martins have become   
 scarce.                               
   Whilst there are no barn owls, tawny
 owls and a few little owls are seen.  
 Short-eared owls occur on the high    
 screes.  In spring swifts and         
 swallows, curlews, lapwings,          
 nuthatches, and tree-creepers are     
 seen.  In winter field-fares gather   
 and sometimes red-wings. The          
 ring-ouzel is a summer visitor to high
 ground.  Black-headed gulls and       
 kestrels are common, and sparrow-hawks
 and rarer birds of prey can sometimes 
 be seen. Red grouse, pheasants and    
 some partridge are also found.        </content>
