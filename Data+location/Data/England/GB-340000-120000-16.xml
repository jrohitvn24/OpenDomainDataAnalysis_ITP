		<title>16Club Day,Kingsbury.</title>
		<content> There was a friendly society in       
 Kingsbury until 1910.The men paid a   
 shilling a week,the women sixpence.   
 Members could have financial help in  
 times of sickness.We talked to a lady,
 who told us how much she had looked   
 forward as a child to the Club Day.   
 First there was a church service for  
 the members.Then they went to the     
 Wyndham Arms in a procession headed by
 the band and a banner.The men's march 
 was on Tuesday,the women's on         
 Thursday.In a marquee the men had     
 roast lunch and the women had tea.    
 After lunch the men went around the   
 farms.Then they went back to the fair 
 by the Wyndham.There were swingboats, 
 coconut shies and rides for a penny.  
 Liquorice sticks,sherbert and dumps   
 (striped sweets) were a penny each.   
 There was a dance in the marquee in   
 the evening.                          </content>
