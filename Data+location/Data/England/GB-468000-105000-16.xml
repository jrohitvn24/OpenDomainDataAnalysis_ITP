		<content> YOUNG FASHION Now a days there are a  
 lot of different styles.Dressers      
 mostly shop in expensive shops for    
 casual clothes.Scooter boys ride      
 Vespas and usually go on rallys and go
 scrambling down on the tracks or      
 woods.Casuals buy comfortable but     
 inexpensive clothes.                  
 COSMETICS Punks wear outrageous       
 clothes,heavy make_up,chains,studs and
 lots of earrings.Their hair is        
 multi-coloured and spiked-up.On their 
 feet they wear heavy boots.Greasers   
 ride massive motorcycles. They wear   
 denim clothes and leather             
 jackets.Greasers hate scooter         
 boys.Hippies have long hair,flaired   
 jeans,flower-patterned clothing,beads 
 and go to Heavy Metal concerts to do  
 head-banging.Trendies are very        
 fashion-conscious and always buy the  
 recent style.                         </content>
