		<content>    We looked at the{houses}in our     
 area very closely. They are mainly    
{semi-detached,}some built recently on 
 private estates but most are{council  
{houses}dating from the 1950's. We also
 saw a lot of{terraced}houses, some    
 going back to as early as 1900.       
    We discovered that most are heated 
 by either{solid fuel}or{gas central   
{heating}but it was interesting that   
 many house-holders who use coal would 
 like to change to central heating.    
    Most people said they liked their  
 homes and their streets but they still
 thought they could be improved. Some  
 said they would like{cleaner,         
{litter-free streets}with wider roads  
 while others wanted patio doors and   
 front porches as well as more garages 
 so that cars did not have to be parked
 on pavements.
