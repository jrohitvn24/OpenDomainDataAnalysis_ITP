		<content>{Result of Survey                      
                                       
 Of 32 people questioned 28 said that  
 they used the hall.                   
                                       
 4 went there more than once a week.   
 7 went there about once a week.       
 8 went there about once a month.      
 9 people used the hall less frequently
 The four people who said they did not 
 go to the hall gave the following     
 reasons                               
 One said," I don't like it."          
 Two said," There is nothing there to  
 interest me."                         
 One person said,"I don't know."       
 From the survey we conclude that the  
 hall is used by most people in the    
 area.                                 
 The hall is also used as a doctor's   
 surgery.                              
                                       </content>
