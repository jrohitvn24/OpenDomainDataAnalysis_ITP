		<title>03INDUSTRY IRON ENGINEERING</title>
		<content> Until 1802 Shotts was  a collection   
 of spaced out farms.That year iron and
 coal were found in quantity on the    
 moors.From then on the town grew.     
{Shotts Ironworks}became famous for    
 fine iron castings and tinned hollow  
 ware.Gas lamp standards were a typical
 product.Production of iron continued  
 till about 1960,and foundry work      
 carried on for a few more years.The   
 closure of the ironworks had a bad    
 effect on employment.                 
 At about this time a factory was set  
 up by the American Cummins company for
 the manufacture of diesel engines,    
 which continues to provide employment.
   The site of the ironworks has now   
 partly  been landscaped and an era has
 gone.
