		<title>09Converted buildings,H.Lorton</title>
		<content>   There are several{converted         
{buildings}in High Lorton.The Village  
 Hall was originally a{brewery}and the 
 nearby building,now used to garage a  
 car and for storage,was the brewery   
{stable.}'Midtown' was a{farmhouse,}but
 is now a holiday-cottage for rent,and 
 its adjacent{barn}is now four holiday 
 flatlets,having also been a garage and
 repair-shop for some years in between.
 The 'White Ash Barn' was also a barn  
 before becoming a home,cafe and craft-
 shop,as was the house now simply      
 called 'The Barn'.                    
   One of the main reasons for these   
 conversions is that the area is within
 a{National Park,}so new building is   
 greatly{restricted.}The newer homes   
 are mostly bungalows built between    
 1930 and the present.Building that is 
 allowed is almost always{in-fill,}so  
 the village is{not increasing}in area.</content>
