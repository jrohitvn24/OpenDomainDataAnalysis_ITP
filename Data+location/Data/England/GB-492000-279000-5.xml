  Grafton Underwood is 4 miles east of 
Kettering. The village runs north south
and is almost half a kilometre from one
end to the other. A stream runs along  
the west side of the street and people 
have to cross the footbridges to get to
their homes.                           
  The houses are old and mainly made of
stone with a few made of brick. Most of
the roofs are made of thatch, but some 
are made of tile and slate. Most of the
houses have very pretty gardens and    
many people grow their own vegetables. 
  There is one shop in the village and 
two farms very close to the village.   
There is a small village hall built of 
wood.
