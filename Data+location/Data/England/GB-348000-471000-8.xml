		<content>    The area is designated as one of   
outstanding beauty with many upland,   
lowland and woodland walks. Besides    
fossil hunters, the crag draws those   
who enjoy a modest climb, panoramic    
views, picnics or wild fruits.         
    The church with its Washington     
links has many points of interest with 
a well-kept rectory ruin nearby.  A    
quarry car park attracts rock climbing 
schools for basic training.            
    Listed homes cover 4OO years of    
village life.  A small Interior Design 
store, until recently a Coop, draws    
from 5 counties and delivers overseas. 
Nearby Leighton Park with its Hall &amp;   
Gillow furniture, has a display of live
eagles, falcons and owls.              
    A Marina is a future possibility   
at Dock Acres gravel lake where recent 
workings revealed a Roman Dock. Stock  
Car racing is held on the shore.       </content>
