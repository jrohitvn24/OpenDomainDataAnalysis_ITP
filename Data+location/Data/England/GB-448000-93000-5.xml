		<content>   1.45 pm                             
          At 1.45 we went in for       
 afternoon school.  We had the register
 and went to our next lesson.  It was  
 games.  In games I played rounders.   
 Rounders is where you are in a team.  
 You have a bat and someone throws a   
 ball and you have to hit it.  You run 
 to a base.  There are four bases.  If 
 you think you can run around all of   
 them you do.  That is called a{       
{rounder.  }You can only get a rounder 
 if you hit the ball hard and far.  My 
 team lost.  We only got two rounders  
 and the other team got six.           
                                       
    3.10 pm                            
           After games there were{House
{Meetings. }In House Meetings we sorted
 out the teams for Sports Day.  I am in
 RED House.
