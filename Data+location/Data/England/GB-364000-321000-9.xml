		<title>09JOHN DODICOTE'S GHOST STORY</title>
		<content>  In 1952 a man called John Dodicote   
 married a woman, he was a bigamist    
 because his wife ran away and he      
 re-married.  Two years later his      
 second wife died so he planted a      
 lavender tree in the church to remind 
 him of his wife's name.  Four years   
 later he became very poor and was     
 sleeping in one of the barns of       
 Dodicote Grange.  One morning he was  
 found dead in one of the barns.  You  
 are supposed to be able to see the    
 body of John Dodicate lying in        
 the straw.
