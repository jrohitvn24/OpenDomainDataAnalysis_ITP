<title>38EDUCATION IN A RURAL AREA</title>
<content>

The village is served by a Local Authority School, Spratton Church of England Primary School and Spratton Hall, an independent (fee paying) prep school.  The village Primary school has about sixty students on roll and other local village schools educate similar numbers of students between the ages of 4 and 11. The majority of these children move on to Guilsborough Secondary School at the end of Year 6, although a few go to other local Secondary Schools such as Moulton and either Northampton School for Girls or Northampton School for Boys.  Spratton Hall School draws children from a wider area and has approximately 400 places. When the students leave at age 13 they often move on to another public (fee paying) schools within the area.   &lt;br />
