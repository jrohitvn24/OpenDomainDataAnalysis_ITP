		<title>10DOVER:FREIGHT TRAFFIC</title>
		<content>                                       
  Over nine years the growth of traffic
 has increased considerably.In 1975    
 there were two hundred and eighty     
 thousand road haulage units.Recently, 
 in 1984 the growth of cargo transport 
 has increased to seven hundred and    
 forty thousand units.This is due to   
 the fact that Dover is the centre of  
 European trade.Dover is now Britain's 
 premier port in terms of value of     
 total haulage.                        
                                       
 Over ten billion pounds worth of goods
 passes through Dover each year and    
 there are twenty five thousand ship   
 movements.The growth of traffic has   
 increased also due to the fact that   
 the English Channel is the world's    
 busiest seaway and is used by ships   
 from virtually every maritime nation.
