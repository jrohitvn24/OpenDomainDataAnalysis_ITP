		<title>07Shopping in Halewood.</title>
		<content>      There are four shopping areas in 
 Halewood. These are on Leathers Lane, 
 Wood Road, Torrington Drive, and in   
 the "village".                        
      The shopping area in the village 
 is rather scattered over three roads  
 and just supply the basic needs of the
 local residents. The shops in this    
 area are relatively old, having served
 the village area for many years.      
      The three remaining shopping     
 centres were built in the mid 1960's  
 at the same time as the overspill     
 estate. The largest by far is         
 Ravencourt on Leathers Lane.          
      Once again the shopping areas    
 mainly supply food, hardware and      
 other basic needs, although Ravencourt
 does have clothes shops and a shop    
 selling electrical goods. For larger  
 items and luxury goods the local      
 residents have to go elsewhere.       </content>
