Knuston Hall lies just off the road    
between Irchester and Rushden.Though   
Knuston was once a small village, now  
there is just the big house and its    
estate.Knuston Hall was a private house
until 1951.In that year it became a    
college and today it is a residential  
Adult Education Centre run by Northamp-
shire County Council.                  
                                       
In Irchester High Street there are     
four listed buildings which are still  
inhabited.The Listed Buildings Guide   
dates them from the 18th century but   
the people who live in them think that 
parts of the buildings may be as much  
as four hundred years old.They are     
built of stone taken from a local      
quarry which is now part of Irchester  
Country Park.The outside walls of the  
cottages are two feet thick.           </content>
