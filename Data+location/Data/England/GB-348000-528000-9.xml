		<content> Penrith has a Truck Stop which has    
 encouraged lory drivers to break their
 journey north. The town has tried to  
 provide more car parking facilities,  
 and an around the town bus service for
 a fixed fare.  All this is very good  
 if you live in the town or a lorry    
 driver, but if you live out of town   
 and do not have a car, or can not     
 drive,and live in the courntry side   
 things are difficult. the bus service 
 to the rural areas are few and far    
 between.  for some areas the school   
 bus is the only bus into town in the  
 morning, thre might be anothe during  
 the day, but to get back home at night
 the last bus leaves  town at 5.30.    
 This makes people who have no other   
 means of transport feel very          
 neglicted.
