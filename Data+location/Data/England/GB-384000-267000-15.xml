		<title>15FARMING IN WORCESTERSHIRE</title>
		<content>{Oh, the joys of farming!}The land is a
 medium heavy clay and only selected   
 areas are suitable for crops - mainly 
 cereals, barley, and wheat, with an   
 even smaller area for market          
 gardening. The predominant cover is   
 grassland, supporting cattle and      
 sheep. There is only limited dairy    
 farming. Fields are small, boundaries 
 are high and unfriendly hawthorn.     
                                       
 The farm buildings are well maintained
 - substantial but not historic in     
 themselves. One of the more           
 interesting is the one recently       
 managed 'separately' from the{old}    
{Manor House at Dovedale.}Woodland -   
 often oak and other hardwood - is not 
 extensive, and is mainly as small     
 copses or field boundaries.
