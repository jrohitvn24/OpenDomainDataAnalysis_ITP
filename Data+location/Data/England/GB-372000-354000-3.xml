		<content>{The By-Pass of Haslington.            
  A By-Pass is being constructed to    
 relieve the flow of heavy traffic     
 through the centre of the village of  
 Haslington and has invoked much       
 arguement and heated exchanges between
 local residents and planners. Three   
 routes were originally proposed and   
 the villagers asked to indicate their 
 preference. This of course varied with
 the affect the routes would have on   
 each villager personally.             
 This issue is by far the greatest of  
 the area at the time of the survey and
 frequent mentions of it can be seen in
 the area press.
