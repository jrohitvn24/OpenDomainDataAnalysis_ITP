		<content> There is one{County Primary school}in 
 the centre of the village.At the      
 present moment there are 25 pupils    
 ranging in age from 4-11 .There are 2 
 full time teachers,a part time cook,  
 caretaker and secretary.Those         
 children who live more than 2 miles   
 away, come to school by taxi.         
 The school has a small playground     
 that is transversed by a public       
 footpath.Downstairs there are the     
 cloakrooms and a classroom.Upstairs   
 is the kitchen and the Infant         
 Classroom which is also the dining    
 room and P.E.hall.                    
 At the age of 11 the children transfer
 to{Lady Lumleys (Comprehensive)}in    
 Pickering.A school coach picks them up
 as there is no public transport.      
 The school building was built in 1874 
 as a Lecture Hall and used as a school
 since 1875.                           </content>
