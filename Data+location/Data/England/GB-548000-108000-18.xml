		<title>18Tourism in Ripe</title>
		<content>      The village is suitable for      
 holidays. Firstly the events in Ripe  
 are interesting to visitors. Several  
 cottages are rented to tourists and   
 just living in peaceful surroundings  
 is a holiday for town-dwellers. The   
 shops, being in a small village, are  
 quite a change from the town          
 supermarket. Here no queuing for the  
 priviledge of paying an astronomical  
 amount of money for a car-load of     
 goods. Every customer is served with  
 patience. Opposite the shops the Lamb 
 Inn is a quiet country pub where one  
 can enjoy a pint of bitter and play   
 darts, toad-in-the-hole or numerous   
 other pub games. Home-cooked food is  
 also served. Walking and cycling are  
 also good relaxing activities and     
 coach tours come out from             
 Eastbourne.Riding and horse care are  
 catered for at Church Farm Stud.      </content>
