		<content> Dobbs Weir Lock is on the new river   
 Lea. This river runs from Luton to    
 the River Thames. The lock was built  
 in 1929. It is 45 metres long and has 
 two gates at each end. These are not  
 the original gates. The top ones got  
 changed in 1978 and the bottom ones in
 1980. Eight small boats can fit into  
 the lock. These are mostly pleasure   
 boats. The boat owners like to open   
 the gates themselves. Accidents rarely
 happen though people sometimes tie the
 rope too tightly when securing the    
 boats. The lock is mostly used in     
 summer because this is when most      
 people sail their boats. Fishermen are
 not allowed to fish within 100 metres 
 of the lock because it is dangerous.  
 The lock is looked after by a lock    
 keeper called Mr. Byatt. He lives with
 his family in a house which is by the 
 lock.                                 </content>
