		<title>02A BRIEF HISTORY-QUEEN CAMEL</title>
		<content>    Originally there were two villages 
 East and West Camel. Edward 1 gave    
 East Camel to his wife. The village   
 continued to be owned by the Queens of
 England and became known as Queen's   
 Camel. Elizabeth 1 exchanged ownership
 with the Mildmay family.              
    In 1639 a fire thought to have been
 started by aggrieved gypsies burnt    
 down 70 houses in Queen Camel. They   
 were rebuilt, using local stone from  
 Camel Hill.                           
    There were 2 mills in each village.
 The one at the East end of Queen Camel
 and the one in the area in front of   
 the church at West Camel were both    
 recorded in the Domesday book.        
    During the civil war, Cromwell's   
 troops camped on Camel Hill, coming   
 down into Queen Camel to damage the   
 church. In the last 900 years the     
 population has risen from 200 to 700. </content>
