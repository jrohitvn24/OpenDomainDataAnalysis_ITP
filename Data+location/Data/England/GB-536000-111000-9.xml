		<title>09The Old Lewes Race Course</title>
		<content>  We interviewed Mrs Ffitch-Hayes,the  
 wife of the man who owns the race     
 course buildings.She told us that when
 the race course was used for race     
 meetings it was two miles all the way 
 round but now some of the courshas    
 disappeared.The race course contains  
 two fences and three hurdles and when 
 we went to look at the two fences they
 were just over half a metre high.     
  The race course is used twice a week 
 for training the horses.They exercise 
 for one and a half hours each day.    
  There are 14 stables and some of them
 are rented out,but there is always at 
 night one horse in each box.Fast      
 Flight is the fastest horse and the   
 most recent horse is Calagat.He cost  
 Â£1500.They feed their horses on bran, 
 hay and racing cubes.They employ three
 or four grooms depending on the       
 season.                               </content>
