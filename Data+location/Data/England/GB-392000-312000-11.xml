are stalls which sell clothes, shoes,  
sports gear, toys, jewellery,          
animal foods, sweets, garden tools,    
bags, lampshades, fruit &amp; veg,         
electrical appliances, wicker ware,    
records and tapes, freezer foods,

eggs, cheese etc..                     
The Saturday market is much larger.    
On Wednesday there is also an auction  
in the covered parts. Bikes, fridges,  
washing machines &amp; cookers, furniture, 
beds and some livestock are auctioned. 
Anyone can take their second hand goods
to be sold. Lots of people come to the 
markets to take advantage of the
