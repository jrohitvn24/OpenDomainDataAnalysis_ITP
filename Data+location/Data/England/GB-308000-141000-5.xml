		<content>   The{narrow and winding A 39}brings  
 most of the holiday traffic into this 
 block. From the stretch above         
 Perry Farm there are superb views     
 both across the{Bristol Channel and   
{to North Hill}overshadowing the       
 hoiday resort of{Minehead.} Many      
 motorist stop on this section of      
 road to take{photographs.   }         
    However less than a kilometre on   
 from this point the A.39 enters a     
 notorious section known locally as    
{"The St. Audries Walls".}The road here
 makes an S bend round the side of the 
{Quantock Hills}and is very narrow but 
 the{main problem}arises out of the    
 fact that the road is bounded on both 
 sides by intimidating stone walls that
 are three metres high in places.      
    Heavy vehicles meeting here can    
 cause traffic chaos..
