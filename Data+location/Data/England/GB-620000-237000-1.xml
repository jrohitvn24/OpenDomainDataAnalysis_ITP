		<content>   The River Orwell flows through the  
middle of this area. On each side of   
the river the land is slightly hilly.  
Most of the land is farmland, with     
some woodland. On the North side there 
are the villages of Nacton and         
Levington. Pin Mill and Chelmondiston  
are on the South bank.  Pin Mill and   
Levington are closer to the river. Pin 
Mill is now a yachting centre. Many of 
the people living in this area are     
commuters. Although the area has few   
amenities, it is very beautiful and    
peaceful and not as flat as much of    
East Anglia. As an area of Outstanding 
Natural Beauty,it is rich in wild-life,
especially in winter when there are    
many migrating birds feeding on the    
river's muddy shores and marshes. There
is concern locally that the proposed   
extension to Felixstowe Docks will have
a detrimental effect on the area.      </content>
