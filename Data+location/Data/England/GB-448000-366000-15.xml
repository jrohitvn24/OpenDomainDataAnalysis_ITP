		<content>  Mrs.Z looked after the Water         
 Works,which was by the side of her    
 house.The Water Works belongs to the  
 Severn Trent Water Authority.She was  
 originally from Australia and has been
 living in Stony Houghton for thirty   
 years.She came over here because her  
 daughter and grandchildren live in    
 Stony Houghton.She owns a dog.Mrs.Z   
 showed us around the Water Works.She  
 told us that the water came from Budby
 and that no other workers had worked  
 at the Water Works for about twenty   
 years.She showed us the machines and  
 large water pipes.Then we had to go,  
 so we thanked her.She said            
 good_bye,and that she had enjoyed our 
 company.
