		<title>04Tim's working day</title>
		<content> I work a farm of 250 acres, producing 
 corn and beef. Winter barley, hay and 
 bagged silage are grown for the beef  
 cattle - spring barley, wheat and     
 winter beans for the open market. We  
 are trying out teazels, borage and    
 lupins. In 1949 the farm employed 13  
 horses and 7 men. Now there is one    
 man, Tim and 3 tractors. I get up at  
 6.45a.m. Choose 5 steers to be sold at
 Bridgwater market, feed rolled barley 
 and bed down the steers under cover.  
 Halfway through breakfast the bell    
 rings - 5 cattle have jumped the stone
 wall of their field - we move them    
 down to the moor and fresh pastures. I
 attend a planninbg meeting for next   
 year's agricultural show, then call on
 a contractor to organise round bales  
 for silage. After some welding and    
 fencing I have supper, watch the      
 'weather' and go to bed at 10.30p.m.  </content>
