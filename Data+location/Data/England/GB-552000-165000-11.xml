		<title>11TRANSPORT-EYNSFORD A225</title>
		<content>The A225 outside our school is always  
being repaired. So much heavy traffic  
uses it that the surface of the road   
needs renewing. The water and sewer    
pipes under the surface get shaken so  
badly that they fracture and have to   
be repaired. This June the road repair 
men fractured the water pipe leading   
into our school so we had to have the  
water turned off for the whole day. It 
was a nuisance especially for our      
school dinner ladies. Our vicar says   
that vibration from the lorries and    
cars is affecting the church. Lorries  
have even damaged the walls of houses  
in Eynsford. Lots of heavy goods       
vehicles come past also dumper trucks, 
oil tankers, tractors and coaches. We  
have even seen a car transporter.
