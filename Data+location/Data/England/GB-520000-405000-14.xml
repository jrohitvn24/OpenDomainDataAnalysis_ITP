		<title>14The Boy Scouts</title>
		<content> The scout group was formed by a man   
 called Baden-Powell and he is famous  
 the world over for forming the scout  
 movement.Our leader is called "Bosun" 
 and we meet on a Thursday at 7.30pm.  
 We start our evening by colllecting   
 "subs"-we pay 20p each week.Then we   
 raise the Union Jack,or flag.We go    
 into groups to work for different     
 badges.Some of these are called       
 "cyclist","first-aid" and             
 "collectors".We also learn knotting   
 and sometimes have a game.We go to a  
 camp in summer and this year we are   
 going to the Yorkshire Dales.To close 
 our meeting we lower the flag and then
 say a prayer.
