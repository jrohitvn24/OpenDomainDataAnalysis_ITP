		<title>12TRAFFIC PROBLEMS</title>
		<content>  {Raynes Park}is a built-up area with 
 a busy shopping centre. This means    
 traffic problems arise. As there is   
 only one car-park nearby, people tend 
 to park on the main road, causing     
 obstructions for passing cars and     
 pedestrians. It is made even more     
 troublesome as there is only one road 
 tunnel from one side of the railway to
 the other. Raynes Park has a busy     
 railway station through which many    
 commuters pass each day.              
   This whole situation should be      
 changed and another tunnel built. But 
 if this system were to be closed for  
 rebuilding, access to the shops,      
 station and other buildings would be  
 impossible. This area is very         
 dangerous for pedestrians to cross    
 these hazardous roads as traffic comes
 from all directions. The Authorities  
 need to pay attention to the problems.</content>
