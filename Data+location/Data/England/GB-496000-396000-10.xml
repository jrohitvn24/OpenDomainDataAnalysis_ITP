 am to get my breakfast ready.She wakes
 me up at 7:55 am.Soon it is time for  
 her to set off for work.She gets her  
 bags ready and then she sets off with 
 Mrs.Johnson in the car.The first thing
 she has to do is check all the        
 chickens have water and grain.Mum     
 works at Pyewipe poultry farm.At      
 12:00 pm she goes into the canteen to 
 have her sandwiches and have a chat   
 with her workmates.After that she     
 starts work again.She loads chickens  
 onto lorries.After a hard day's work  
 she comes home.The first thing she    
 does is make a cup of tea.Then she    
 sets off upstairs to run a bath.After 
 she has relaxed for a while she starts
 to cook Dad's and my tea.When we have 
 finished our tea Mum washes up the    
 pots.Dad helps her by drying them.Then
