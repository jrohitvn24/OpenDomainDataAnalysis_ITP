		<content>      Hartlepool has thirty licenced   
 taxis and thirty three licenced       
 private hire vehicles operating within
 the town.  A taxi licence is Â£30 per  
 year and a private hire licence is Â£30
 per year.                             
      There are eight taxi operators in
 Hartlepool, the main ones being       
 Camerons and Streamline.  Camerons    
 taxis are mainly four year old Ford   
 Cortinas which have been converted to 
 run on either Liquid Propaine Gas or  
 petrol.  Streamline taxis are new     
 Vauxhall Cavaliers with diesel        
 engines.  All taxis must display a    
 large Hartlepool licence disc on the  
 side of the vehicle.  They also       
 usually advertise their company name  
 on a light up display panel attached  
 to the roof of the vehicle.
