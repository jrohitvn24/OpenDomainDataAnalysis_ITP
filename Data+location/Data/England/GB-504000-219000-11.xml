		<content>Foxdell Junior school has an upper and 
a lower part.  They have little gardens
outside each classroom.  They have a   
little compartment for nature and other
things to do with the countryside. The 
classrooms have tables instead of      
desks. The classrooms are on two sides 
of the hall and a kitchen is on        
another. Between the classrooms are    
libraries one has a shop in it. In the 
cloakrooms there are sinks, with paints
and clay.                              
At playtime the 144 children have to go
up a slope to the playground. There are
about 20 species of tree along the side
of the field and playground. The field 
goes up to the edge of the M1 motorway,
this might be dangerous if a lorry came
off onto the children. In the staff    
room are settees they were hard. There 
was also a kiln for making the pottery 
hard, a red light shines when it is on.</content>
