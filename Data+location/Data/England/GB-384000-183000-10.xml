		<content>  The most popular drink that Mr.Bell  
 sells is Draught beer and the most    
 expensive spirit is Brandy.He also    
 sells chocolate,sweets,nuts and       
 crisps.We asked him if he ever gets   
 Drunken People in the pub,He said No, 
 he didn't encourage it but if somebody
 got silly that person would be asked  
 to leave the premises.The biggest     
 bottle he has got is one that holds   
 whisky which,when full holds 1 gallon 
 and the smallest bottle is a bottle   
 with herbs for Stomach aches.He show  
 us the Skittle Alley another bar with 
 team photos. In the cellar the beer   
 barrels are kept cold in the Summer   
 and slightly warm in the Winter.In a  
 storeroom we saw how the beer is      
 forced up to the bars by compressed   
 gas or is pumped up by hand.
