		<content> Highfield Farm is situated on the     
 main A10 road to Ely, in Littleport   
 itself. Highfield Farm is the largest 
 owned by a large local firm.          
 The farm has a dairy unit which is not
 typical of fen farms.The farm owns 127
 cows, which are milked daily, and 1   
 bull. Young calves go to another of   
 the firm's farms at{Black Horse       
{Drove,}a village 5 miles away, but the
 others will be sold to other farms.   
 Highfield Farm covers 385 acres of    
 land.The main item of machinery is the
 tractor, which is used to pull many   
 implements such as ploughs &amp; sprayers.
 In 1986 the new{bypass}will come to   
 Littleport and it will split the farm.
 There is a{weather station}on the     
 farm, which only has 21 inches of rain
 a year. The arable unit deals with    
 growing crops such as sugarbeet,      
 potatoes, cereals and carrots.        </content>
