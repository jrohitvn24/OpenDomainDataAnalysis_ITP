		<content> Chester Moor,a village of 350         
 inhabitants to the south of Chester-le
 -Street,once had two collieries but   
 the last closed in 1961.Since then    
 things have changed and now there is  
 no shop or post office.Some of the    
 miners' houses have been demolished.  
 Chester Moor has 130 employed people, 
 100 are retired and 50 are children   
 which leaves 70 unemployed.50         
 households have cars and there are 90 
 pets.Most families have telephones and
 go to Chester-le-Street market on     
 Tuesdays and Fridays. Interesting     
 opinions about the village were "full 
 of good neighbours","a happy mix of   
 country and town","there are no shops"
 and "dirty dogs foul the pavement."
