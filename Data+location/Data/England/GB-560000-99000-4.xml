		<title>04An Old Lady living in E'bne.</title>
		<content> Isobel is 79 years old and lives at   
 l5a,Bedford Grove. She has lived in   
 Eastbourne for 23 years and is a very 
 kind and helpful old lady. She goes   
 out frequently in a car or bus and    
 loves the Pier and the Bandstand. She 
 likes living in the Upperton area     
 because there are many parks close by 
 and it is easy to get into town.      
 She thinks Eastbourne is clean and    
 that the gardens are beautifully kept,
 although the pavements are very       
 unsafe. She thought it would be too   
 expensive to repair them.             
 "I use a bus every day" she said. "Bus
 fares are reasonable and the shops are
 excellent."                           
 She enjoys reading the local newspaper
 to see if she knows anybody.. {"The   
{people are the salt of the earth" }   
 said Isobel.
