		<title>03 Holywell Row</title>
		<content>  This village of less than 100 houses,
derives its name from what was the     
largest well, which was known as the   
Holy Well. We could not find out much  
about the Holy Well except that it was 
used for Christenings and was situated 
near to one of the oldest houses called
{Quaker's End},probably on the site of 
the {Methodist Chapel}. The village has
changed very little over the past 50   
years. Many of the residents are       
connected with farming and there is a  
large {chicken farm} and an {egg farm}.
The area Undertaker also lives in      
this village and it is here that there 
is a Chapel of Rest.                   
  Most of the houses lie on either side
of The Street and vary in age from over
500 years old to modern bungalows.     
{Holywell Farm} at one end of The      
Street has a Suffolk Barn dating back  
to 1776.                               </content>
