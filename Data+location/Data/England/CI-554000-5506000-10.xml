		<title>10Transport in Alderney</title>
		<content>  On the island there are many         
 different methods of transport.On land
 there are buses,taxis,bicycle hire,car
 hire,Island tours and even a train(the
 only one left in the Channel          
 Islands).This does trips from a       
 station near the harbour to a quarry  
 at the eastern end of the island.At   
 sea The Condor Hydrofoil comes in     
 three times a week from Guernsey in   
 summer.There is also a service from   
 Torbay in the summer.Smaller boats    
 also do trips round the island and to 
 France.                               
  By far the most important sea route  
 is that run to Guernsey every week.   
 Alderney Shipping brings most of      
 Alderney's vital supplies and if ever 
 a shop runs out of a product the      
 answer is always "it's on the next    
 boat"
