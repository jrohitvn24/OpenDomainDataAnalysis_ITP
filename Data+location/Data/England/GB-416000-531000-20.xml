		<title>20HUNWICK METHODIST CHURCH</title>
		<content> New Hunwick Primitive Methodist Church
 was built in 1875 &amp; was the first of 2
 Methodist churches.When built, the    
 only form heating was from a big      
 coal fireplace.Services have been     
 held weekly ever since then, and      
 Centenery Celebrations were held 10   
 years ago.A Sunday School was held    
 every week until about 3 years ago,   
 when it closed down due lack of       
 support.However after 2 years there   
 was a renewed interest, &amp; in October  
 1984 a Sunday School was re-opened &amp;  
 has been a great success ever since.  
 There are 60 pupils on the books &amp; the
 average weekly attendance is 40.Since 
 it restarted, two plays have been     
 performed, &amp; this year a Sunday School
 Anniversary - a concert of children's 
 songs &amp; recitations - is due to be    
 held.Sunday School Outingsto the      
 seaside &amp; Leisure parks are popular.  </content>
