		<title>12FOXTON AT WORK</title>
		<content> There is very little work in the      
 village itself.We have a shop run by  
 Mr.and Mrs. Thornton which supplies   
 everything from pins to pineapples.   
 We have 2 Public houses,the Black     
 Horse(Mr.and Mrs. collins),the        
 Shoulder of Mutton(Roy Plius)actually 
 in the village + the Pub/Restaurant at
 Foxton Locks.Gartree has its own      
 Officer's club The Jolly Warder.      
 By and large though most people work  
 outside the area.The following are    
 some of the jobs our parents do       
 Housewives,Cobbler,Prison             
 Officer,Auctioneer,Sculptor,Teachers, 
 Shop assistants,Tailoress,Farmers.    
 Foxton is therefore a dormitory town  
 and not an idustrial one.             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
