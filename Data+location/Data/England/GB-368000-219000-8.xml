		<content> Huntley C of E (Aided) Primary School 
 was built in 1874-5 by the Rector of  
 Huntley Rev. H.E. Miles and first     
 maintained by him. The school building
 is adjacent to the church and in 1985 
 has 85 pupils arranged in three       
 classes. The {population}of Huntley   
 grew rapidly in the early 70's and the
 school had to be enlarged. One        
 terrapin was placed at the front of   
 the school in the 70's and a 2nd. has 
 been erected since 1980 between the   
 school building and the church. At 11 
 years of age all children in Huntley  
 transfer to an 11-18 Comprehensive    
 School at{Newent}which in 1985 has    
 over 1200 pupils.
