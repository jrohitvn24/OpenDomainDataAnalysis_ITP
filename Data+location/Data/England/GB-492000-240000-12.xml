		<title>12FARMING AROUND CRANFIELD.</title>
		<content>{  Farmland }in  the  area  is  arable,
 basically  winter  wheat.  The secon- 
 dary  crop  is  winter barley. Because
 the  soil is cretaceous  clay and only
 grade 3  the  wheat  and barley go for
 animal feeds.                         
   A very small proportion of top grade
 wheat is  used for flour.  Rye is sold
 to Ovaltine to be used in drinks. Some
 beans  are used for  Frankfurter  sau-
 sages and  others are used for  pigeon
 feed. Peas are dried and used as  they
 are. The  oil-seed  rape is  sold  for
 margerine and cooking oil.            
   Farming  has  changed  in  this area
 over the last few decades  from  mixed
 farming and market gardening to arable
 farms and sheep farms.                
  The   countryside  has  altered  from
 small fields with hedge bounderies  to
 larger fields.
