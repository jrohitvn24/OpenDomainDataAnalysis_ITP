		<title>20INDUSTRIAL DEVEL. ERDINGTON</title>
		<content> In this largely residential area      
 industry is concentrated into two     
 industrial estates.                   
 1. Birch Rd East trading estate. This 
 site belonged to GKN and was purchased
 by sapcot who sold off individual     
 units which now house a diverse range 
 of industrial activities.(from making 
 bicycle wheels to printing.) In       
 addition some purpose built units have
 grown up alongside.                   
 2. Holford industrial estate. sold off
 by a large company (IMI). On the      
 cleared site high quality units are   
 being built in an attractive          
 landscaped environment alongside the  
 river Tame. Both developments have    
 resulted from the decline in capacity 
 of traditional industry which has     
 resulted in large scale unemployment. 
 A government grant is helping to      
 remedy the situation.                 </content>
