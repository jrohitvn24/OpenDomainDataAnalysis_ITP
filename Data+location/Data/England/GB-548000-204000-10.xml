		<title>10Chase Farm</title>
		<content> The owners are Mr and Mrs Wollard. The
 farm animals are all pigs and cows.   
 They have a guard dog to protect them 
 from foxes and from people stealing   
 the animals. We could not count all of
 them because some have gone to market 
 at Chelmsford. There were 18 sheds and
 their equipment wasn't very good. They
 had two tractors, a plough and a      
 dumper. There was 4 acres of land.
