The petrol filling station has a small 
shop where sweets and cigarettes are   
available. Although this is the only   
one in the area there are a few more   
shops and a Post Office in the neigh-  
bouring village of Sandon. The nearest 
Doctor's Surgery is also in Sandon.    
                                       
The County Library Mobile Unit visits  
the area fortnightly and a Mobile      
Grocer visits weekly. Although the     
groceries are expensive, it is a       
valuable service for people without    
transport. However it is uneconomic    
and likely to cease soon.              
                                       
Most locals shop in Stone, using cars  
to get there as the bus service is so  
poor. Many car owners are willing to   
give lifts to those who need them.
