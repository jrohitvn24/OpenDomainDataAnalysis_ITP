		<title>16FARMING ECONOMY, TRURO AREA.</title>
		<content> Profit margins in farming in this area
 are small. The owner-occupier, family 
 farmers make sufficient money to live 
 comfortably, not luxuriously, &amp; invest
 in their farms.  Capital is tied up in
 stock, modern machinery, &amp; buildings; 
 the expense of these is balanced by   
 increased efficiency &amp; reduction in   
 expenditure on employing workers.Costs
 have risen steadily for several years,
 while prices for beef &amp; lamb have     
 altered little:a bullock of 500/600kg.
 liveweight sells for Â£1.86/kg.; a lamb
 approx. 20kg. deadweight is Â£2.75 in  
 spring, reducing in summer/autumn.    
 A tractor which cost Â£1,000 in 1970 is
 now Â£15,000.  Tractor fuel, a major   
 running cost, is Â£500 for 500 gallons.
 This area was traditionally dairy,beef
 &amp; sheep country,but more money can now
 be made from cereals ("barley-barons")
 which require considerable investment.</content>
