		<content> Royston Drift mine is a medium sized  
 pit.                                  
 Mining is one of the largest          
 industries in the area and the mine at
 Royston has been an important part of 
 our village since it was first started
 as Monckton Main Colliery in 1875.    
   There are 500 workers at the pit.420
 people work underground and 80 people 
 work above ground. 50% of the workers 
 come from the local villages of       
 Royston and Ryhill.                   
   The pit produces half a million     
 tonnes of coal a year for the power   
 stations of Ferrybridge and           
 Eggborough.The coal is taken on trains
  There are two trains a day.Each train
 carries 1000 tonnes of coal.          
 The Drift Mine is 100m deep and it    
 goes 3 to 4km underground.Mining is   
 still a dangerous job.Colin Gwynne our
 next door neighbour is a miner.       </content>
