 kitchen garden, and the covered glass 
 area of some 9000 sq.ft. now holds a  
 wide range of pot plants, ceramics,   
 silk flowers, bulbs, garden sundries  
 and a range of conifers, heathers,    
 trees and shrubs are also raised in   
 the nurseries.

 These extensive gardens were          
 originally laid out by the fifth Lady 
 Mellicent Lilford at the begining of  
 the 20th Century.
