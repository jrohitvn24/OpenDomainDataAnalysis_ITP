		<content> Many people use Derby as a stepping   
 stone to the Peak District and some-  
 times look around Derby whilst they   
 are in the area. Derby has some fine  
 hotels such as the Friary and the     
 Pennine. There are also some statues  
 and monuments around town such as that
 of Michael Bass, a former MP. A beauty
 spot is the River Gardens near the    
 Council House. People sometimes take  
 photographs of Friargate Bridge, which
 was bought for Â£1 in 1984. Tourist    
 attractions are also the modern       
 aspects of Derby, such as the Assembly
 Rooms, which hosts films, concerts,   
 exhibitions, sporting events, etc.    
 The Market Place has exhibitions and  
 political rallies are held there too. 
 There are two museums: the Derby      
 Museum attached to the Library and the
 Industrial Museum in the Old Silk     
 Mill.                                 </content>
