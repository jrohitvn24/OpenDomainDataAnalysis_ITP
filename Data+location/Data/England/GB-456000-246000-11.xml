		<content>{THE CROWN INN AT WESTON}              
 Eariest history unknown, first public 
 record of the Inn is 1440 as part of  
 the endowment of All Souls College,Ox-
 ford by Arch. Chicele.  First ref: of 
 a private hostelrie on a small cross- 
 roads is 1593 &amp; complete records there
 after are dispayed in the Main Bar.   
 Today the Crown is more than just a   
 Pub being the focal point for Social &amp;
 Organised activities; Local Cttees.   
 such as Young Farmers &amp; Rotary, May   
 Fete &amp; Political Organisations meet   
 there; Darts &amp; Skittles Matches are   
 held &amp; Traditional &amp; Jazz Music played
 most weeks.  Morris Men dance outside 
 while inside Shove-Hapenny &amp; Dominoes 
 are to hand.  Local Beers are on tap &amp;
 Special bottled Stouts etc. with most 
 Spirits.  Also hot/cold food  served. 
 Welcome is given to children &amp; adults 
 so the Crown is more Club than Pub.   </content>
