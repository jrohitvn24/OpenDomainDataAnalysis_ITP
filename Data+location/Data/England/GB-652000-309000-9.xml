		<content> BURE PARK, GT. YARMOUTH               
   Mr.Terry Whitwell and his assistant 
 Janice, who work for Yarmouth Borough 
 Council,came to the school to tell us 
 about the Park. They told us that Bure
 Park,as it is now, is two years old,  
 and owned by the Borough Council.It   
 was opened by Gordon Chapman,the then 
 Mayor of Gt.Yarmouth.                 
   It is used mainly by local people,  
 and some holidaymakers. The open part 
 of the park can be freely used for any
 activity.                             
   Future plans include provision of a 
 permanent campsite.                   
   He told us that an unconfirmed story
 says that a circus elephant was once  
 buried there.                         
   The grounds were reclaimed from     
 allotments and a waste tip.
