		<title>05Going to the Hospital</title>
		<content>     The General Hospital is in New    
Street.   I am a diabetic.   The nurses
are very good to me.   They wear light 
blue and dark blue dresses.   The      
doctor I see is called Dr. Addy, he    
wears a long white coat.   He is       
sometimes nice but other times he is   
quite horrible and he asks lots of     
questions.   I have to have a regular  
check-up and sometimes a blood test.   
They take my blood with a needle about 
4-5 cm long and the bottles are        
different sizes.   The syringe is a 1/2
ml syringe.   Sometimes they take a    
full syringe.                          
     Other people that have to go to   
hospital are old people and people that
have broken a bone.   Sometimes if you 
have broken a bone you would have to   
stay in hospital for a very long time.
