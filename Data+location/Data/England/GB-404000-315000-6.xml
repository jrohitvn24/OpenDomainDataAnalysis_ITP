a tile and timber roof. There are two

lectern, the pews and the hymn books   
were from nearby churches which had    
closed due to a drift in population.

carved angels and flowers, the altar   
with embroidered cloths. Outside are   
gargoyles and stone crosses.Yew,lilac  
holly, wild violet,orchids and         
harebells are found in the churchyard.

families take part in the Youth club   
Mothers Union, festivals and Concerts.
