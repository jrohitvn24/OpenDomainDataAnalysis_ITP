		<title>19TRANSPORT IN WEDMORE AREA</title>
		<content>   Most people in the area travel by   
   car.                                
{Public Transport:}The only public     
   transport is a bus which goes to    
   Wells. This service is poorly used  
   and is in danger of being withdrawn.
{Community Bus:}A community bus has    
   been running for some years and     
   collects people from their homes. It
   travels to shopping centres in      
   Street, Bridgwater and              
   Weston_Super_Mare. Those using it   
   most are old age pensioners and     
   those without cars.                 
{Mobile Services:}Mobile services are  
   well used and needed in this rural  
   area, in particular a daily delivery
   of milk, the visit of the library   
   van, fresh bread deliveries and the 
   fish and chip round.                
 Many people{walk or cycle}to the shops
 and for pleasure.                     </content>
