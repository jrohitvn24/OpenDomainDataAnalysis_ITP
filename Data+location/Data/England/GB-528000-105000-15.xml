		<title>15Preston Park</title>
		<content> Preston Park, a large and pleasant    
 expanse of 67 acres, some 2 miles     
 north of Brighton, was bought by      
 Brighton Corporation in 1883 for      
 Â£50,000 from Mr and Mrs Stanford.     
 At the northern end of the park stands
 Preston Manor, a house built on the   
 site of a previous Manor. It was given
 its present Georgian form in 1738 by  
 Thomas Western, Lord of the Manor of  
 Preston.                              
 The house is open to the public and is
 well worth a visit. You will see      
 beautiful furniture and a valuable    
 collection of china dogs.             
 In the grounds of the Manor are the   
 graves of the Stanford family pets.   
 Each one has an interesting           
 inscription.
