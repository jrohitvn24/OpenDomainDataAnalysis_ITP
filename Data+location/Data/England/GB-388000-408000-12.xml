		<title>12GROUNDWORK AT THORNHAM</title>
		<content>                                       
      On the 20th. May, 1985 a group of
 pupils from Thornham St. James Primary
 School took part in a wildflower seed 
 sowing ceremony, arranged by the      
 Groundwork Trust, down Thornham Old   
 Road.                                 
      Groundwork Trust is an           
 organisation that looks after the     
 countryside. Many local people are    
 worried about the way wild flowers are
 dying out. Wild flowers need          
 protection because there are so many  
 buildings covering the land and       
 weedkillers are poisoning the plants. 
      Thornham Old Road is a cartroad  
 where there is not much traffic and   
 the wide verges are not sprayed with  
 weedkiller. It is a good place for    
 sowing wildflower seeds. The flowers  
 should grow well.
