Black Country Museum in Birmingham.In

studying the early 20th century.       
At the Museum the class visited old    
houses,pubs,shops and chapels.They saw 
how craftmen,such as chainmakers,used  
to work.   The class stayed at Everdon 
Field Centre for a week during which   
time they did local studies,for        
example of houses and an old church.   
In the summer term the class spent a
