		<content> In Cheddar there are three schools,the
{First School,}where I go was started  
 in 1845 in two little cottages in     
 North Street.In 1871 our present      
 school was built but as it got too    
 small for all the children in the     
 village other wooden classrooms have  
 been added. Children start school when
 they are four years old and go to the 
 Middle School when they are nine.There
 are 234 children in our school.       
{Fairlands{Middle School}was built in  
 1976 and children leave there when    
 they are thirteen years old and then  
 they go to{The Kings of Wessex Upper  
{School.}There are 430 children at     
 Fairlands .There are 850 children at  
 the Upper School and they leave when  
 they are sixteen or eighteen years    
 old.We like all the schools because   
 there are lots of interesting things  
 to do.                                </content>
