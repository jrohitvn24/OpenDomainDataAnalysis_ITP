		<content>{MILTON WAS A FARMING COMMUNITY AND    
 MOST OF THE FIELDS WERE SOWN WITH     
 GRASS TO FEED THE NUMEROUS COWS OWNED 
 BY EIGHT FARMERS.TODAY THERE ARE MANY 
 HOUSES,MANY LANES,AND ROADS BUT NO    
 COWS BECAUSE MOST OF THE FARMS ARE    
 USED FOR CROPS.THE RESIDENTIAL SURVEY 
 SHOWS THAT THERE ARE ONE HUNDRED &amp;    
 FIFTY THREE DETACHED HOUSES,TWO HUN-  
 DRED &amp; NINETY SIX SEMIDETACHED,       
 FOUR TERRACED HOUSES,SIXTY SIX        
 BUNGALOWS,NINTY SIX FLATS,SEVEN SHOPS,
 FOUR PUBLIC HOUSES AND FIVE CARAVANS. 
{THE GHOST OF MILTON:}PEOPLE SAY THERE 
 IS A GHOST AT MILTON HALL AND THAT IT 
 IS OF A COACH WITH HORSES PULLING     
 IT.IT DRAWS UP OUTSIDE THE HALL WHERE 
 A LADY GETS OUT AND ENTERS THE        
 HOUSE.NO ONE EVER SEES ANYTHING BUT   
 HEARS THE NOISE OF THE HORSES         
 HOOVES,THE COACH WHEELS AS THEY PULL  
 UP OUTSIDE THE HOUSE,AND THE RUSTLING </content>
