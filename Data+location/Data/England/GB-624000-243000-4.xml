		<title>04R.A.F.MARTLESHAM 1939-1963.</title>
		<content>The outbreak of hostilities during     
September,l939, brought about a change 
in Martlesham's role, as the           
experimental unit, the A.&amp; A.E.E. moved
away to Boscombe down in Hampshire,    
where it resides to this very day.     
Fighter squadrons moved onto the Heath 
and the station took active part in the
Battle of Britain and once again names 
of note served at Martlesham - Bader - 
Stamford-Tuck and Townsend to name but 
a few.                                 
During the Summer of 1943,units of the 
United States Air Force moved onto the 
airfield and their Thunderbolt and     
Mustang fighters remained there until  
the Armistice.                         
Experimental flying was conducted on a 
limited scale post-war but the station 
was gradually run down until it        
finally closed as an R.A.F .           
establishment during l963.             </content>
