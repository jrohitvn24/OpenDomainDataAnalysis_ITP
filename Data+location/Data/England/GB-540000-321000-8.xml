    Between 1170-1180 during the reign 
 of Henry II a stone church was        
 built.Today it has the oldest, the    
 tallest and most perfect timber spire 
 in the country. The nave is Norman,   
 having rounded arches and windows and 
 pillars, which are short and thick. On
 the capitals the decoration is        
 scalloped. There is also a Norman font
 at the west end of the north aisle.   
 Early in the 13th century, during King
 John's reign the tower was added. At  
 that time it was separate from the    
 church and stood on four corner piers,
 the arches being open. It is in the   
 Early English style and the remains of
 a mass-dial can be seen scratched on  
 the south-east pier. A monk's cell    
 was added at the north-east end for   
 the priest and passing pilgrims. It   
 has two storeys.                      </content>
