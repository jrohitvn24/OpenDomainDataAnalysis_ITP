		<title>05ST.ERNEY PARISH</title>
		<content>  Most of this land is farmed by       
 "owner-occupiers", although there is  
 a growing danger of smaller farms     
 being sold up and made into bigger    
 agricultural holdings. There are      
 already two cases of this in St.      
 Erney.The nearest amenities are at    
 Landrake a little more than a mile    
 away from St. Erney and so all        
 43 inhabitants have a car and a phone.
 There is no bus service. The oldest   
 house in St. Erney is Markwell.       
 A farm of particular interest is known
 as{POLDRISSIK FARM.}It covers 160     
 acres and each field is about 7 acres.
 The farmer keeps sheep and beef cattle
 which he sells as yearlings. In an    
 old barn here there is a mural        
 which is earlier than the 14th        
 century. It is thought that the       
 building was a chapel used by the     
 monks.                                </content>
