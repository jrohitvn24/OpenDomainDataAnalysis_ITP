		<content>    Clitheroe is to be found in the    
 heart of Lancashire's Ribble Valley.  
 It is an old market town which has    
 grown around the castle keep that     
 overlooks the town.                   
    There was little change until the  
 Industrial Revolution. Then the coming
 of the cotton mills caused rapid      
 growth and development of the town.   
    Today only one of the original     
 seventeen mills is still producing    
 cotton goods. The main employment is  
 now to be found in the I.C.I. and     
 Ribble Cement works.                  
    With Pendle Hill to the east, the  
 River Ribble to the west, the old     
 market town of Clitheroe is now       
 developing its historical and         
 beautiful setting to good advantage.
