		<content> This area of Kent is good farming land
 Most of the holdings are small mixed  
 farms; many have larger fields growing
 crops of Wheat,Barley,Oats and Hay; a 
 few acres of Potatoes and other root  
 crops. The corn is  Autumn sown and in
 Spring some fields are sprayed with   
 fertalisers. As the crops ripen, these
 fields contrast with pastures of grass
 land left rough for grazing animals.  
 When the hay is cut it is bound into  
 blocks or large rolls,then stacked in 
 huge barns till needed for winter feed
 Combine harvesters are very expensive,
 so many farms share machinery when the
 crops are ready for harvesting.Stubble
 is either burnt or left for sheep to  
 nibble before the fields are ploughed 
 and sown again for the following year.
