		<content>   The area around  Badger Edge is very
 difficult land to farm , being so     
 bleak and exposed, with  the result   
 that the keeping of horses, as in so  
 much of the{marginal farming land}of  
 the area, has been an increasing      
 activity in recent years.             
   The area around{High Moor}is the    
 part that is the least pleasant as far
 as appearance is concerned. The       
 scenery is scarred with a stone quarry
 and a civic amenity site (public tip).
 However these places provide some     
{local emloyment,}with up to 35 men at 
 the quarry.Other local employers      
 include the farm owned by Collings    
 Brothers who employ young people on   
 the Y.T.S. scheme and the Old Original
 pub.                                  
   Most of the remaining land is       
 divided into small fields of poor     
 quality pasture for sheep and dairy   </content>
