		<content> There is a wide variety of houses in  
 the area.Some houses are made of local
 clunch  stone.Others are brick,half_  
 timbered, wattle and daub and         
 plastered.                            
 Commercial End and the High street in 
 Swaffham Bulbeck are conservation     
 areas.The Abbey is probably the oldest
 house in Swaffham Bulbeck.It was built
 900 years ago.Burgh Hall,Mitchell     
 Hall,Malt House,Lordship Farm and the 
 Vicarage are the biggest houses in    
 Swaffham Bulbeck.                     
 Fewer houses in Swaffham Bulbeck are  
 owner occupied than is usual in the   
 area or in the country as a whole.    
 This is because of a large council    
 estate and a lot of council_owned old 
 peoples dwellings.There is a similar  
 mixture of houses in Lode and         
 Longmeadow but there are more thatched
 roofs in Lode.                        </content>
