		<content>  The people who live in this mainly   
 residential area feel that Chichester 
 is a good place to live and are happy 
 here. Many  work  within  Chichester, 
 providing the manpower for the county 
 services while large numbers  commute 
 to Portsmouth &amp; other areas. There is 
 a large retired population  who   are 
 attracted by  the  amenities  of  the 
 area. Tourists  come to see this  old 
 cathedral city and make it their base 
 for  visiting  the  area. Most people 
 like Chichester as it is,but their one
 common complaint is car parking-a real
 problem  within  the  confines  of  so
 small a city. Over all most people are
 happy  living here _ a city where past
 and present meet and merge so happily.
