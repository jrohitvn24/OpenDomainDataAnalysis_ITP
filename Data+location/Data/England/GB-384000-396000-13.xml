		<title>13Manchester's financial core</title>
		<content>  As well as being a major retail      
 centre Manchester is also an important
 financial centre. The financial       
 district is centred on the old corn   
 exchange south of the main shopping   
 areas. Here are located a large number
 of banks, building societies and      
 insurance companies. These occupy     
 mainly reconverted Victorian buildings
 although there are a few modern       
 offices such as the National          
 Westminster bank on King Street.      
 Fieldwork by students has shown that  
 these institutions tend to cluster    
 together in a relatively small area.  
  As well as the usual British Banks   
 there are a number of foreign banks   
 represented in Manchester such as the 
 Banque National de Paris and the      
 Somali Bank.
