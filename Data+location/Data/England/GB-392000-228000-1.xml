		<content>           The area surveyed by first  
 year pupils from Cleeve school (a     
 mixed comprehensive of 1350 pupils)is 
 6 kilometres to the north of          
 Cheltenham.The area has no large      
 settlement within it but does include 
 parts of the following villages:      
 Bishops Cleeve, Stoke Orchard,        
 Gotherington, and Woolstone. With the 
 exception of Woolstone, all the other 
 villages have shown a considerable    
 increase in their populations in      
 recent years.                         
           The area lies immediately to
 the west of the Cotswold Hills and    
 marks the division between the Severn 
 valley and the steep scarp slope of   
 the Cotswolds. The land lies between  
 30 and 60 metres above sea level.The  
 settlements which mark the eastern    
 part of the area are spring line      
 settlements.                          </content>
