 their gardens which makes  the village
 picturesque. Proximity  to  the Humber
 with a safe  haven  means  many people
 have  an interest in{boats.}Apart from
 pets  there are more than 12 livestock
 hobbyists,   their  interests  ranging
 from {pigs,  geese }and {ducks}to{cage
{birds, fish,  pigeons }and {bees. Dogs
 are trained  to the gun and for police
 work.{Soft fabrics}are used for making
{toys,  patchwork,  rugs,  knitwear}and
{lace.}There are  at  least  four hobby
{painters}and  an  equal  number  whose
 interest is in fine{woodwork. Shooting
 and {fishing }have a large  following,
 the latter both in  the salt  water of
 the Humber and in the artificial ponds
 that have been excavated in the centre
 of the village and on the outskirts.
