		<title>03A TYPICAL JOURNEY TO SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   I get up at 7.00am,wash,dress and   
 have my breakfast.After a short walk I
 catch the bus outside the church at   
 Clodock at 8.15pm.                    
   The bus travels through the isolated
 rural settlements of Longtown,Craswell
 and Michaelchurch,a distance of 8     
 miles across the many hills and       
 valleys of the foothills of the Black 
 Mountains.                            
   Some settlements have no official   
 name and are called by their local    
 name such as "Bob's Shop".We leave the
 foothills by travelling down a hill   
 called the'Slough' which leads us     
 through Turnastone and Vowchurch.At   
 Vowchurch we join the B4348 which     
 takes us to school.The total journey  
 is 15 miles and takes 50mins.The      
 return journey is the same and I      
 arrive home at about 4.30pm
