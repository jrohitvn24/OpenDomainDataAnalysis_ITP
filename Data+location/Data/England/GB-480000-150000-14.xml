		<content>  Leisure is an important part         
 of people's lives in Church Crookham. 
 We discovered many places where people
 spend their leisure time. They were   
 Tweseldown Race Couse,The Peter Driver
 Sports centre and Redfields Nursery. A
 survey showed people visiting         
 Tweseldown were                       
 Point to Point Racing,Three Day       
 Eventing ,Fun Runs, Pony Club         
 Meetings, Scrambling, Charity Walks,  
  Kite Flying and Dog Walking.         
  Avondale Tennis Club is in Ewshot    
 Lane and moved to its present site    
 from Avondale Road in Fleet.  It has  
 over a hundred playing members and a  
 thriving junior section with coaching 
 facilities.  There are six courts with
 weather surfaces and floodlights.     
 Members mainly come from Church       
 Crookham and Fleet.
