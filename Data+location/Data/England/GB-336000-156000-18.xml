		<content> Canada Coombe is a road in our area.  
 It has lots of trees. Up the road     
 there is a track and on the track     
 there is a barn, which contains hay.  
     In one field there is some kale,  
 and there is also a lot of rubbish.   
 We also found a lot of stinging       
 nettles which had a lot of butterflies
 on them.                              
     Near the kale was an old house    
 which had been half demolished which  
 looked dangerous.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
