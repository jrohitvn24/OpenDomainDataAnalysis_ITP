		<title>04RANSKILL WALK (A)</title>
		<content> For our walk around Ranskill,we first 
 went up Station Road to the Crossroad.
 Then we went up Blyth Road to where   
 there is a large coal stream.Bircotes 
 Pit is going to expand to a super-pit,
 running under Ranskill and other      
 villages.Then we turned right, down a 
 small road towards Serlby.We passed   
 fields of Wheat,Sugar beet,Peas and   
 Potatoes.We were walking past the golf
 course when we saw racing horses being
 trained by one of my friends' dad.On  
 the walk the boys were challenging our
 knowledge of flowers,so we astounded  
 them by naming all the flowers we saw,
 Speedwell,Forget-me-not,Nettle,Red and
 White Campian,Poppy and Cow Parsley,  
 half of which the boys had never heard
 of! We were now walking down Folly    
 Nook Lane,we turned down by the       
 railway and back to school again.UGHH!
