		<title>15A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content>  Mum woke me at 7.30am. I had         
 breakfast, when I had finished I got  
 ready for school, Dad gave me a lift  
 to school. I went into class,our first
 lesson was reading, then everyone had 
 to do a cartoon or maths.After break  
 the two top classes took assembly     
 about the school journey.             
  After lunch I went outside to play.In
 the afternoon we played rounders, did 
 school journey work,had a break and a 
 story. School finished at 4.00pm.I    
 went home and had tea.                
  After tea we went to the open evening
 at school where parents looked at our 
 work and saw slides of the school     
 journey to Derbyshire.We also enjoyed 
 a piece of home-made Bakewell tart and
 coffee.After arriving home I watched  
 T.V. and went to bed.
