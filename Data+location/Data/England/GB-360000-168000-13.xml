		<title>13A school day (2)</title>
		<content> books, read the Bible, or listen to   
 the teacher talking to us about       
 charities.                            
 We have lunch at 1200 hrs. either in  
 the school canteen or the school hall.
 I bring a packed lunch containing     
 bread rolls with a  meat filling and a
 can of Pepsi drink. After eating, we  
 sit, talk or play with our friends in 
 the playground. We can also buy Ice   
 Creams or Lollipops from the visiting 
 Ice Cream van.                        
 At 1300 hrs. the bell calls us to our 
 Form rooms again for registration.    
 This is followed by a History lesson. 
 I like History. The day ends with a   
 Cookery lesson for which we have to   
 bring ingredients and make scones,    
 flans, cakes etc. At 1530 hrs.        
 school ends and we go home to have tea
 and do our homework exercises.
