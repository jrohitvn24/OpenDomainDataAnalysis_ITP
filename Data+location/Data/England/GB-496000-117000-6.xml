 the area is Duncton Recreation Ground.
 Here stoolball, cricket and football  
 are played, and a new pavilion has    
 just been built.Badminton is played in
 Duncton Village Hall.                 
                                       
 Clay pigeon shooting is a more recent 
 innovation and pheasant shooting      
 takes place during the appropriate    
 season.                               
                                       
 There is fishing on the south bank of 
 the river Rother and also at Burton   
 pond, where pike, tench, and eels are 
 caught.                               
                                       
 There are occasional meetings at      
 Bigenor Farm near Shopham bridge where
 Motorcycle cross events take place.
