		<content>    The southern parts  of  Basingstoke
 have  seen  a  massive development  in
 housing resulting in the loss of large
 areas of countryside. However, efforts
 have been made to integrate old{hedges
 with  new housing and  many  new trees
 have been  planted. Earth  banks  have
 been used alongside the M3 motorway in
 an attempt to  remove{noise pollution.
  The M3 has acted as a natural barrier
 to  the  spread  of  housing  and  has
 helped conserve the countryside  south
 of it.Stubble burning by local farmers
 sometimes annoys the local residents. 
    With our{climate}and  exposure  to 
 winds the chalky  soil dries  out very
 quickly. Nevertheless, rape  seed  and
 wild poppies have  soon re-established
 themselves on the man-made banks.     
    Skylarks and kestrels are plentiful
 and many house-martins,swifts,swallows
 and other house-loving{birds}visit us.</content>
