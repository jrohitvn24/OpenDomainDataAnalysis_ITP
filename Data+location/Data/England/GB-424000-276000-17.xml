		<title>17WORK OF A HOUSEWIFE IN 1985</title>
		<content> My Mum spends about half the day doing
 housework while in her spare time she 
 does dressmaking and knitting. The    
 appliances that she finds most useful 
 are the automatic washing machine,    
 vacuum cleaner, food mixer, cooker,   
 iron and sewing machine. The most     
 useful of these she thinks is the     
 washing machine because she just puts 
 the clothes in, sets the programme,   
 then takes the clothes out when it has
 finished. The jobs which she does most
 are cooking, cleaning and washing up  
 but she says that all of these are    
 much easier nowadays because the new  
 appliances are quicker and easier to  
 use than the old ones used to be. I   
 usually go shopping with Mum at       
 weekends and we spend between 1 and 3 
 hours doing this. She says it is hard 
 work being a housewife because the    
 jobs never come to an end!            </content>
