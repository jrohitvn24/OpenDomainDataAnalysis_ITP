		<content> Crops include wheat, barley, oilseed  
 rape and oats plus cutting of         
 grass for sileage and hay. E.E.C quota
 Regulations greatly affect the acreage
 of crops grown each year. The fields  
 are large and economical enabling     
 large tractors and ploughing          
 attachments to be used.Sub-contractors
 are used by many farmers for          
 hedgecutting, drilling and at harvest 
 He may only employ one cowman and     
 perhaps one labourer extra to his own 
 family's labour for the routine       
 running of the farm. Modern methods   
 can mean one man being able to plough 
 or sow a field in just hours. A       
  proportion of potatoes, swedes       
 and turnips are grown - some as winter
 feed for the cattle. At Nevill Holt   
 there is a mushroom farm and nearby a 
 soft fruit farm, which is self-pick;  
 saving the farmer labour costs.       </content>
