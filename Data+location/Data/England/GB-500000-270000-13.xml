Hargrave is a village three miles east 
of Raunds. It is on the borders of     
Northamptonshire,Bedfordshire and      
Cambridgeshire.It has a population of  
approximately 250 people. Hargrave     
has two roads leading to it, the main  
A45 road and a by-road. The village is 
set in a low valley about 80 metres    
above sea level.The soil is Oxford     
Clay and is rather chalky. The water   
supply comes from Raunds and from      
Bedfordshire. Electricity first came   
to village in 1949. There are no       
schools in Hargrave so the occupants   
have to go to Dean, Kimbolton, Raunds  
or Wellingborough. There are no shops  
or recreation areas but there are a    
lot of woods and spinneys suitable for 
walking anbd exploring. The name       
Hargrave means "army camp" and it is   
believed there was a roman camp there. </content>
