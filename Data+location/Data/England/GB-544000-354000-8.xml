		<content> The school bell rings, it's 8.45. I   
 open my door to find 25 pairs of eyes 
 beaming up at me. They all file in,   
 we settle down for registration and   
 the collection of the dinner money. Â£1
 coins make it so much easier! We      
 process to he hall  for hymns, prayers
 and the day's pastoral message. Back  
 in the classroom we discuss today's   
 news, the "bull(vol)cano" in Columbia.
 Lessons follow in the 3 R's with a 15 
 min. break at 10.30 for crisps        
 biscuits etc. and a play outside. At  
 noon it's "meat and 2 veg". Today's   
 extra activity is guitar rehearsal.   
 The bell goes at 1.05 and the         
 afternoon begins with activities and a
 computer game. At 2. 30 I have the top
 class for music. School ends at 3.05  
 but it's 3.15 by the time the children
 have gone. I prepare for the next day 
 and go home-with my marking etc.!!    </content>
