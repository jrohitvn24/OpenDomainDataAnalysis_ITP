		<content> Alec Jarrett Ltd is a wholesale       
 butchers and meat packers. The        
 business is about 60 or more years    
 old. It was on a different site for   
 about 50 years or so and 10 years ago 
 the only site in the area, was        
 trasferred across to the High Street, 
 to a new location. They employ        
 approximatly 100-150 employees.       
    Everyday in the summer 100-150 cows
 are killed, but in winter 200 are     
 killed. 200 sheep are killed every    
 Thursday and 80 pigs on Mondays and   
 Thursdays.                            
    The annimals are first stunned     
 electronically, or shot with special  
 guns. Then their throats are slit. The
 animals are the frozen and packed for 
 sale.
