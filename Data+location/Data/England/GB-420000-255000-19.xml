 nearest to Shakespeare's Birthday     
 on April 23rd there is The Ceremony   
 of the Flags and The Birthday Parade. 
 Ambassadors and dignitaries from all  
 over the world come to unfurl the flag
 of their nation.They walk in stately  
 procession to The Birthplace and      
 then continue through the town to lay 
 a wreath on Shakespeare's tomb in Holy
 Trinity Church.Children from local    
 schools take part in the parade and   
 also put on a display of country      
 dancing in the Bancroft Gardens.

 Annual Stratford Festival.The first   
 event is the Grand Carnival which     
 raises money for charity.Our school
