		<title>15THE PUBLIC HOUSES</title>
		<content> In{Fenwick}there is a private house   
 that used to be the{Plough Inn.}It was
 built in 1846. At the side you can    
 still see the stables and dray room   
 where the cart and horses, that       
 fetched the beer, were kept. Nowadays 
 there is a new pub, the{Baxter Arms   
 which is a converted farm house. It is
 very popular with people from all over
 the region. The{Star Inn}in Moss has  
 been a public house for over 200      
 years. The same family have run it all
 that time. It has kept its old world  
 charm but now has an adventure        
 playground at the back for the        
 children. The local hunt meet there   
 occasionally.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
