		<title>01EPPERSTONE AN INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content>  Epperstone is a picturesque village  
 situated in a conservation area 7     
 miles north_east of Nottingham.Large  
 mature trees lining the main street,in
 the churchyard and in gardens,are a   
 striking feature of the village.      
  Property is very expensive,making it 
 difficult for young people born here  
 to remain in the village.Some large   
 houses provide service employment for 
 villagers.Much interest is taken in   
 the cultivation of gardens and all the
 available allotments are in use.The   
 wish to conserve and to resist change 
 is very strong amongst the villagers  
 as a whole.                           
  Epperstone attracts many visitors,   
 particularly to the"Cross Keys Inn",  
 and to walk the public footpaths.The  
 local residents also enjoy these      
 amenities and feel privileged to live 
 in such pleasant place.               </content>
