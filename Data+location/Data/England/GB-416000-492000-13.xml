		<title>13Hunton Village Shopkeeper</title>
		<content>   Our day starts at 5.45a.m. The first
 job is a family  one,  sorting out and
 delivering papers or magazines. We eat
 breakfast at 7a.m. A bread van arrives
 daily  before the shop opens at eight.
 The first customers appear;  men going
 to work, early women shoppers,children
 heading for school.                   
   On Tuesdays  and  Fridays I drive to
 Leyburn for confectionary,  meat, pies
 and fresh baked bread. Each day I open
 the{POST OFFICE}at 9a.m. I deal with a
 steady stream of  customers  for child
 allowances, pensions etc. Twice weekly
 I deliver provisions around  this  and
 nearby villages. Being a village store
 we stock a wide range of goods.       
   The day's Postal business  has to be
 completed by 4.45. Shoppers are served
 up to 5.30. Then the  shop  closes and
 tidying up  begins,  plus my replacing
 stock and preparing next day's orders.</content>
