 UMBERLEIGH: The shop is near the RIVER
 TAW. The owner said the most popular  
 sweets were Kit-kats and Mars bars.   
 General stock includes fruit and many 
 household items. Originally built in  
 the 17th century the building used to 
 be a church. The owner sells 75 papers
 on Sunday but not so many during the  
 week. There have been tourists in the 
 shop but not very many-about 40 per   
 week. The village shop in             
 CHITTLEHAMPTON sells many household   
 items and fresh meat which Umberleigh 
 does not. 20-25 tourists visit in a   
 normal week during the holiday season.
 There is also a lovely florist shop in
 Chittlehampton. See also GUEST HOUSE  
 and INN UMBERLEIGH.
