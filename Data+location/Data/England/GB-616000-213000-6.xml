 The{Royal Hotel}is one out of many    
 hotels in Clacton in 1985. All the    
 hotels have comfortable rooms, good   
 food and accommodation. The Royal     
 Hotel is a 3 star hotel with first    
 rate service.The breakfasts will put  
 you in a good frame of mind for a day 
 exploring of centuries of history,    
 miles of beach and a great time       
 generally. There are a variety of     
 hotels to be found along the seafront 
 Esplanade itself, as well as in the   
 various roads leading back towards the
 town.                                 
 Obviously somewhere will always have a
 vacancy, but with better Summer       
 weather there are always many visitors
 who wish to enjoy their holiday in    
 Clacton-on-Sea.
