		<title>10Bell Street-Sawbridgeworth</title>
		<content>{Bell Street}is the main shopping area 
 in Sawbridgeworth. It is a one way    
 street and where it meets London Road 
 there used to be an inn and some small
 shops. These have been knocked down   
 and new buildings put up.             
 There is a new supermarket, Budgens,  
 and an enclosed shopping arcade with  
 pleasant shops. On a rainy day you can
 shop there without getting wet.       
 At the other end of Bell Street       
 another similar complex has been      
 built. There is a lot of competition  
 between various shops. They do not    
 clash with the older type shops but   
 fit in quite pleasantly and make a    
 useful addition to the shops of       
 Sawbridgeworth.                       
 It is a pleasant place to meet people 
 and you can see groups of friends     
 quietly talking as they meet one      
 another unexpectedly.                 </content>
