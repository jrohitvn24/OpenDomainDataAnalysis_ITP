		<title>14Chinley Independent Chapel</title>
		<content> The little church in Chinley called   
 Chinley Independent Chapel is where a 
 number of people go every Sunday      
 morning to sing songs and listen to   
 different people talk about God.      
  It was built in 1711 and has been    
 restored twice. The Hymn Board is     
 surrounded with its own history.      
 No-one knows by whom or where it was  
 made. During the restoration of the   
 Chapel in 1908 it was found in the    
 foundations.                          
   The Chapel serves three hamlets,    
 Chapel Milton, New Smithy and The     
 Wash.The burial ground contains many  
 memories of the dead, including       
 nineteen ministers who have served the
 Chapel. It always has freshly picked  
 flowers in vases and when the sun     
 shines through the windows on the blue
 paint,it looks like the sky.
