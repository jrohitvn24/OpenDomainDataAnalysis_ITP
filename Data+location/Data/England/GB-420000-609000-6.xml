		<title>06SAINT MARY'S CHURCH.</title>
		<content> The oldest building in Lesbury is     
{St. Marys church.}It was built some   
 time in the twelfth century.The church
 is surrounded by graves and trees,    
 these trees are mainly sycamore, horse
 chestnut and yew trees, but there are 
 also some older ash trees. The graves 
 are{centuries old,}most of them are of
 the 18 hundreds,some were dug even    
 earlier.There were some old family    
 tombs which had been there so long    
 that they were crumbling or even      
 falling down.The writing engraved on  
 these was also worn away.There were   
 some tiny gravestones for{babies}who  
 had{died}only a few months old.There  
 is a sealed door at the side of the   
 church,known as the{Devil's Door.}It  
 is so named because in a christening  
 it was opened to let the devil out.
