		<title>09The Tractor and Bailer</title>
		<content>   The tractor is the work horse of the
 farm. It is used for pulling          
 attachments such as the plough.       
 Tractors work like cars but they have 
 far more power and can pull as much as
 a lorry and some say they can do the  
 work of four horses. Tractors vary    
 greatly in price, ranging from about  
 Â£4,000 to over Â£30,000.               
   Another important piece of machinery
 on an arable farm is the bailer. It is
 used to collect the straw and to      
 compress it into large bundles. Some  
 produce rectangular bundles and cost  
 between Â£4,000 and Â£5,000, and others 
 produce round bundles and cost between
 Â£7,000 and Â£9,000.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
