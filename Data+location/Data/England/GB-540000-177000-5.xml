		<content> As our area is largely residential it 
 is therefore covered by houses, flats,
 some tower blocks, maisonnettes and   
 bungalows. A small section is covered 
 by park land, two fairly large parks, 
 Maryon Park and Maryon Wilson Park.   
 Our school is called Woodhill, the    
 same name as the street. Years ago    
 they were both known as Wood Street.  
 In those days the area was very       
 wooded. There is still a large number 
 of trees in the Woodhill area and of  
 course both the parks contain many    
 trees and a great variety of trees    
 also. Where our school stands the area
 was thickly wooded but this was a long
 time ago as our school celebrated its 
 centenary in 1983. It is now the only 
 large building in the area, apart from
 a tall block of flats. It is also a   
 listed building under the Greenwich   
 Borough Council.                      </content>
