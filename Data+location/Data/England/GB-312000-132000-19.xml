		<title>19NATURE AROUND THE SCHOOL</title>
		<content> In 1984 a swarm of bees came over the 
 swimming pool while the Juniors were  
 swimming.A beekeeper came and took the
 bees away,but he killed the queen bee 
 by accident.We also have house-martins
 nesting under the eaves of the Junior 
 classroom.In the pond in the garden,we
 have got some young frogs.One day,in  
 1985,a young male blackbird came into 
 the Junior classroom.Mrs Bruce,Simon's
 mum,came in and took the blackbird    
 outside.We found some birds eggs in   
 one of our hedges.One day we found a  
 different bird in a house-martins nest
 in the out-side shed.In the Juniors   
 classroom there are two gold-fish.One 
 day in the Infant classroom Matthew   
 caught a butterfly and Kate put it in 
 a jar.From the Library,a man brings in
 stuffed animals and birds and puts    
 them in our classrooms for us to look 
 at.                                   </content>
