		<content>   The village population of about 1400
 people is well-served by churches. The
{Congregational Church}founded in 1906 
 is less active today, although still  
 licensed. At the{ Mission-on-the-Green
 chapel a small but enthusiastic band  
 of worshippers meet regularly. The old
{Parish Church of St.Giles }(CofE) has 
 a thriving community life.As well as a
 full range of services and devotional 
 activities there are a number of clubs
 and associated groups for its congre- 
 gation (aged 0-90+). The church dates 
 from Saxon times.{ St.Stephen's Church
 (R.C) has grown in numbers and in its 
 range of religious and social activity
 since it was founded in 1970 as an    
 offspring of St.Paul's,Haywards Heath.
 It caters for a large area (25 sq.mls)
 Half the lively membership are from   
 the village.  Strong ecumenical links 
 exist between the village churches    </content>
