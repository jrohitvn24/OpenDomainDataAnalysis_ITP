		<title>20WALKING  THE  " PENNINE WAY"</title>
		<content> In the North_Eastern section of our   
 block runs part of the "Pennine Way". 
 This was the first of the country's   
 long distance footpaths. It runs,     
 uninterupted, from the Peak District  
 of Derbyshire in the South, to the    
 Cheviots in the North.                
     In our block it peaks at Windy    
 Hill (991133), at a height of 466m.   
 The name of the hill is very apt, for 
 even on Summer's days it can be very  
 wild; and is a reminder to any one    
 that the moorlands are not to be      
 treated without respect.              
     Access to the Pennine way in our  
 block can be obtained by leaving the  
 M62 at exit 22 and travelling south on
 the A672 for approximately half a     
 mile.
