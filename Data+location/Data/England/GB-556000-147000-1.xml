		<title>01N.TONBRIDGE &amp; HILDENBOROUGH</title>
		<content>  The area lies to the north of        
 Tonbridge and comprises the northern  
 outskirts of the town,as well as the  
 neighbouring parish of Hildenborough. 
 It is heavily residential,with many   
 modern estates,private and council,   
 but with much older housing too. Shops
 are few,and there are no factories.   
 There are several schools (state      
 primary,state secondary,and private   
 preparatory and public schools.Playing
 fields in the area all belong to the  
 schools).There are also several farms,
 giving the area a rural flavour.This  
 land is mainly grassland,but there are
 many acres of crops and some uncultiv-
 ated woodland.Several public footpaths
 cross this land.Local bus services are
 good on main routes,and two local     
 railway stations(40 minutes to London)
 are within easy reach of the area.
