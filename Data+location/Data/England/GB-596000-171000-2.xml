		<title>02Eastchurch Village</title>
		<content>         The{village}of Eastchurch was 
 mentioned in the Domesday Book as     
 Eastcryne. It is a small, closely knit
 community with a relatively unchanging
{population}where families have lived  
 for many years.                       
         The church of All Saints is a 
 feature of the centre of the village  
 retaining evidence of the past.       
         During the day few people are 
 seen in the village as most travel to 
 work elsewhere.                       
         Although there is a village   
 school for younger children all those 
 over the age of nine travel by bus to 
 schools in Sheerness seven miles away.
         Basic amenities can be found  
 there as there are one or two shops,  
 public houses, a garage, a restaurant 
 and a hairdressers.                   
         The village hall is frequently
 used for{clubs}and{entertainment.     </content>
