 the Mining Industry. The festival is a
 one day event of free entertainment.  
 It has already become a focal point   
 for the community through which local

 Trevithick Society in the Camborne    
 area for local people interested in   
 Industial Archaeology.The society     
 studes old engine houses and mining   
 works.The highlight of Trevithick Day 
 is a group of dances performed by     
 local schools and people in the       
 area.The dance steps were decided by a
 competition,including the costume     
 colours of black,yellow and white.    </content>
