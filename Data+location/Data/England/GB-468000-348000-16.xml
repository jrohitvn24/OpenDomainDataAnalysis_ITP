		<content>   Whilst many regret there are not    
 more leisure facilities or            
 opportunities, what there are seems   
 commensurate with a joint population  
 of about 1100 people.                 
   In{Bleasby}there is a village hall, 
 the{Jubilee Pond}area for walking and 
 nature,and use of the playing field at
 the school.There is a Chapel and a    
 Church with Sunday Schools and Youth  
 Clubs.There is the W.I.,an artists'   
 group,Brownies and Guides,aerobics and
 judo classes and a mother and toddler 
 group.                                
   In{Thurgarton},there is the Church  
 and Chapel with a joint Sunday School 
 and a ladies' group,an excellent hall,
 the W.I.,a table tennis club and a    
 sewing class.There is a thriving{     
{cricket team}which plays in the fine  
 setting of the{Priory}grounds and is  
 conceived by all as being "their" club</content>
