   The pet show is held at the back of 
 the institute on a patch of grass.    
 There were three catagories. The first
 was for big dogs,the second for small 
 dogs and the third for any other      
 animals. First of all you had to walk 
 round in a circle,then make the dog   
 sit down. After that the judges went  
 round and asked how old the dogs were 
 and what breed they were. After about 
 five minutes they decided the winners.
 In the third catagory there were      
 budgies,rabbits,hamsters and kittens. 
   On Tuesday there was a five mile run
 starting at 3.30.Dougie aged 14 was   
 the youngest runner,and there were 6  
 Richmond harriers among the 50        
 starters. The race started at the     
 Institute,up to Forest, through       
 Bolton-on-Swale and back to Scorton.
