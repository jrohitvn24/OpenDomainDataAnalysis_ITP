		<content> There is a lot of pollution in this   
 area.                                 
 By the motorway there are a lot of    
 fumes from the cars.For example;a man 
 who lives next to the motorway has    
 seen a white substance on his apples. 
 Also there is a danger of a chemical  
 leak from the{Nuclear power station.} 
 A white foamy substance has been seen 
 in nearby streams which finally run   
 into the river Severn.This could have 
 been caused by car exhausts.          
 There is no evidence of major         
 pollution on nearby farms.But there is
 always the threat of pollution from   
{slurry pits}which can overflow into   
 streams and rivers killing the fish by
 extracting the oxygen.                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
