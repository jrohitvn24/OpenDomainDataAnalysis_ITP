		<content>  The majority of people owned their   
 own home - only 14% lived in rented or
 council accomodation.  The most       
 popular type of housing was           
 semi-detached, as this usually meant  
 that the houses had spacious gardens. 
 The number of people living in        
 detached houses and bungalows was     
 slightly less but there were even     
 fewer people living in terraced houses
 and flats as these were smaller and   
 had very little space for the room    
 required by a family.                 
{Heating:}31 of the 36 people          
 questioned had central heating in     
 their home; 68% had gas powered       
 heating whilst the other 32% powered  
 their homes using electric, oil,      
 solid-fuel or a combination of fuels.
