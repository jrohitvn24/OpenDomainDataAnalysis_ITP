		<title>20THE FUTURE- CONCLUSION</title>
		<content>                                       
The future plans for the village do not
allow for great growth. One estate of  
private houses is planned;one more     
block of Old Peoples housing is        
planned.Other development will be      
infill.Industrial development already  
under way should maintain the present  
low figure of unemployment.Development 
of social facilities is needed because 
the largest hall seats only 100 people.
  Earls Barton presents a well balanced
community of mainly owner-occupiers    
with ambition as the numbers enrolling 
at the Adult Education classes shows.  
It has a large nucleus of younger      
families with mobility.The proposed    
rail development at Wellingborough will
continue  to make this village an      
attractive place to live in.
