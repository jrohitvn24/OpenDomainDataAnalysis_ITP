		<title>12SERBIAN CHURCH,TELFORD.</title>
		<content> The Serbian community originally came 
 from Yugoslavia.They left their native
 country during World War II when Yugo-
 slavia was occupied by the Germans and
 did not return because a communist    
 dictatorship took over.The Serbians   
 needed a church and national centre of
 their own and in 1966 - 67 bought the 
 Methodist Church,Donnington.The church
 was altered inside to suit the tradit-
 ions of the orthodox faith and was    
 furnished with a new altar and holy   
 ikons.Bishop Dinisya, the head of the 
 Serbian church outside Yugoslavia,came
 from Chicago to consecrate the church 
 in 1968.According to the Orthodox     
 faith, a church must have a bell-tower
 The building of tower was financed by 
 the Serbian community and the bell    
 donated by the Church of St.Nicholas, 
 Newport.There are few full services as
 the serving priest lives in Halifax.  </content>
