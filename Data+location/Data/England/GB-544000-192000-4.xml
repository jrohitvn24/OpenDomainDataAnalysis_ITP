		<title>04MILLERS FARM</title>
		<content>   The owner of the farm is called Mr. 
 Taylor and he is a sheep farmer.  His 
 sheep are called FinnDorsets which are
 a cross between a Finnish sheep and a 
 Dorset Horn. He has 150 ewes,130 lambs
 and 6 rams.  He breeds them for meat  
 because if you sell them for wool, you
 only get Â£1_Â£2 for a fleece.          
                                       
   The sheep stay out in the fields    
 until Christmas when they come in for 
 lambing.He takes the sheep to market  
 and hopefully, they are all gone by   
 August.                               
                                       
    All his sheep are shorn in the     
 first week of July. The sheep are     
 dipped in a special water which gets  
 rid of pests. This is called{Dipping}.
                                       
   In his spare time, he rides horses  
 which he has hired.                   </content>
