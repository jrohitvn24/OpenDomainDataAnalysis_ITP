		<content> (Survey- 59% return on all possible)  
  In the last 20 years,6 new estates   
 have been added to the village.       
 Our survey shows that 36% have lived  
 here for less than 5 yrs;39% for      
 between 5 and 10yrs and 25%for more   
 than 10. Only 20 people are native    
 born                                  
  Many newcomers are retired and this  
 has unbalanced the distribution of age
 groups.14% are below 11yrs;11% are of 
 secondary or further education age;7% 
 are between18 and 30,whereas 38%are in
 the 31 to 60 group and 29% are over 60
  Nearly half of the sample were born  
 either in the S.E. of England(27%) or 
 in the Midlands (16%).                
  31% are from elsewhere in Cornwall   
 and a further 10% come from other S.W.
 counties.                             
  In a class of 29 children only 6 were
 born in Pelynt.                       </content>
