		<title>09EAST TILBURY</title>
		<content> The part of {East Tilbury}with        
 which we are concerned consists of    
 many between-the-wars bungalows near  
 the railway and a large post-war      
 housing estate mainly built by the    
{Bata shoe}factory.This firm favours a 
 paternalistic attitude towards their  
 workers and provided a large sports   
 ground,a cinema, a hotel, a junior and
 an infant school, shops and a dairy   
 farm.Unfortunately with the recession 
 the factory is no longer so           
 flourishing and the farm and hotel are
 no longer there.Nevertheless the      
 community has grown and includes a    
 number of fast food shops and a       
 four-doctor surgery.                  
    The original village of East       
 Tilbury is just down the road towards 
 the Thames with individually-styled   
 houses but sharing most of the        
 facilities.                           </content>
