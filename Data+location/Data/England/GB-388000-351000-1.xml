		<title>01Norton region</title>
		<content> The Norton region lies to the west of 
the city of Stoke-on-Trent.Whilst Stoke
is primarily an industrial area, famed 
for its pottery production, Norton and 
its surrounding villages has a more    
diverse nature.Firstly the area is made
up of a number of separate villages,   
Ball Green,Brown Edge,Baddeley Green,  
and Norton itself, being the largest   
settlements. Most of these are old     
villages whose early economy was       
based on farming.                      
 But with the rise of Stoke-on-Trent as
a large industrial centre its influence
has been felt with the growth of       
industry such as the Doulton and       
Bullers ceramic works, and the now     
shrinking coal industry; and in the    
building of large housing estates to   
cater for the Stoke overflow. However  
the region still retains much of its   
character and independence.            </content>
