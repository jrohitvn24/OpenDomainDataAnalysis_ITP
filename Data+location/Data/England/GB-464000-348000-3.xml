		<title>03THE WOMENS INSTITUTE</title>
		<content>  The W I was founded in 1920 and meets
 on the 2nd Tuesday of each month in   
 the Social Institute. The meetings    
 start with business (last months      
 minutes, letters and future events)   
 followed by a guest speaker, the      
 subjects varying from cookery, craft, 
 travel and professional work talks,   
 the evening finishes with tea or      
 coffee and a chance to chat. We are   
 also a member of the Willow Group of  
 local Institutes which gives us an    
 opportunity to meet our neighbours and
 friends from nearby villages (Lambley,
 Oxton, Woodborough, Calverton and     
 Woodthorpe). We run a monthly         
 Chiropody Clinic which is open to     
 everyone.
