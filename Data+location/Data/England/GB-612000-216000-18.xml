		<content> The survey area showed little scope   
 for recreation and leisure activities.
 The two caravan parks did however     
 offer facilities to people in the     
 holiday periods. Tourists came from   
 lots off different places as far away 
 as Wales to the Shangri-La caravan    
 park. The caravan parks offer some    
 entertainment in the summer. Other    
 features in the survey area were the  
 two pubs which cater for the locals as
 well as the holiday-makers. However   
 there is not much else in this area   
 particularly for teenagers who would  
 go to Clacton or Colchester for things
 like the cinema and disco's. This area
 realy offers a peacefull, quiet       
 location for people on holiday and has
 got nice lanes and farm tracks for    
 walking. The coast is not very far    
 away.
