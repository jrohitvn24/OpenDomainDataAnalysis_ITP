		<title>13Homelife in the Twyford Area</title>
		<content>{Homes:}Everyone enjoys a good         
 standard of living and homes are well 
 furnished and comfortable.Almost      
 all have central-heating fueled by    
 oil,electricity,bottled gas,coal      
 or,as in many rural areas,wood.There  
 is no gas in the area. Labour-        
 saving gadgets such as cleaners,      
 washing machines,food processors,     
 and mixers are used in every home.    
 Most have a freezer.                  
{Family:}Families become more and more 
 scattered as work or marriage takes   
 children away from the family home.   
 Very few marry a partner from the same
 area.Most housewives have a part-time 
 or full-time job outside the home once
 children are at school.Husbands now   
 are very much involved in the home.   
{Meals:}Families usually have breakfast
 and the evening meal together.Lunch is
 a snack.Sunday is for leisure together</content>
