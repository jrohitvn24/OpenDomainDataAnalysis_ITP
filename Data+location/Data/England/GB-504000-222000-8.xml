		<content> A modern purpose-built home for the   
{Elderly Mentally}Infirm.Most{residents
 have their own room,whilst a few share
 double rooms,where they can keep      
 personal effects.For the less mobile  
 there are ample facilities for them to
 follow more sedentary pursuits.Routine
 is very important e.g regular meal    
 times also frequent toileting is      
 necessary, as most of the people are  
 incontinent due to their mental state.
 Apart from the staff there are social 
 workers,hairdressers,therapists,e.t.c.
 We visited the home at 2.30 pm,to talk
 to the people.They were very talkative
 about things in the home,and about    
 each other.They were very aggressive  
 to each other,and one of them         
 threatened to "beat another resident  
 up", but they really did like the home
 and had lots of things to do.
