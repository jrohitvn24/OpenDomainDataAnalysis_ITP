		<title>09     Broadgate Farm</title>
		<content> We visited Broadgate Farm which has   
 been used by Hilliers Nursery for     
 growing trees and shrubs for many     
 years. This year they have sold the   
 land and it may not be farmed for many
 more years.                           
                                       
 The land manager showed us round. He  
 pointed out all the different species 
 of trees they were growing. He said   
 the land was very difficult to use    
 because it was clay in one field and  
 sand in another and some fields were  
 all mixed up.                         
                                       
 We had to be careful in one field of  
 trees because they had been sprayed   
 with a pesticide.                     
                                       
 There is still a farmhouse there but  
 it does not belong to the farmland    
 anymore.                              </content>
