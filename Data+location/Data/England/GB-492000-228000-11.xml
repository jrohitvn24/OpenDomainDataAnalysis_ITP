		<content> Following the major rail strike in    
 1955 and closure of the main line     
 sidings in 1969, the sand traffic     
 was diverted to road.                 
                                       
 In 1967 a society was formed to       
 protect the line. It now operates 3   
 steam engines and a number of diesel  
 locomotives.                          
                                       
 The oldest steam locomotive'Challoner'
 is a 1877 vertical boiler 0-4-0 built 
 to work in the North Wales slate      
 quarries. The second locomotive       
 'Rishra' is a 0-4-0 Baguley built in  
 1920 and brought back from India in   
 early 1970s. The largest is a 0-6-0   
 woodburner brought back from Africa,  
 Built in 1936 by Orenstein &amp; Koppel.
