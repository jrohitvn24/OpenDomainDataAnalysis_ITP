		<title>05The Desford Lane Peddlers</title>
		<content> In Ratby there is a club called the   
 Desford Peddlers. They collect vintage
 bikes. The most interesting bikes they
 have are the Bone-shaker, the         
 Quadrant, and the Penny-farthing. The 
 Quadrant has 3 wheels and it is very  
 easy to get onto. The Penny-farthing  
 is not so easy to get onto. It has a  
 big wheel at the front and a small    
 wheel at the back. The Bone-shaker is 
 made completely out of wood and when  
 it moves it really shakes because its 
 tyres are made out of wood as well.   
      The group also collect the old   
 lamps that used to go on the bikes.   
 These used to work by oil or candle or
 carbide. Carbide gives of a gas when  
 water is dripped onto it and then you 
 light the gas with a match. The lamps 
 have green and red glass at aech side.
      The group ride and display the   
 bikes all over the world.{Robbie      </content>
