		<title>09Finding an owl in Uyeasound.</title>
		<content> I found a dead owl in the Playpark.We 
 took it into school and tried to      
 identify it using books but we could  
 not.We took the owl to a Uyeasound man
 who is interested in and knows about  
 birds.He helped identify the owl.We   
 found out it was a short-eared owl.The
 man who identified the owl told us how
 to identify this species in flight.   
 There is a dark band across the       
 underside of the wing.The tufts of    
 feathers on the head are not really   
 the owl's ears, they are what give the
 owl its name.                         
   The owl had no food in its crop and 
 it was in very thin and in poor       
 condition.The owl had died of         
 starvation.The owl was probably blown 
 off course when flying from the South 
 to the North of Norway.
