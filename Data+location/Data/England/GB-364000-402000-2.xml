{                                      
      This started in June 1981 and    
 concluded in December 1984.  The site 
 situated at the bottom of Miller's    
 Lane covers 70 hectares and yielded   
 339 thousand tonnes of coal.          
      In the 1950's coal was mined at  
 Beefold, Crabfold and Miller's Lane   
 pits and at that time a railway line, 
 now disused crossed the area.  Coal   
 was under this line and N.C.B.        
 (National Coal Board) wanted to remove
 it.                                   
      Draglines lifted the coal which  
 was taken along the railway line over 
 Leigh Road to Wigan Road and on to    
 Bickershaw Colliery.
