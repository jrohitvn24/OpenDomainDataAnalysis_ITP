		<title>12BOY'S SCHOOL DAY</title>
		<content> I go to school at 8.45am and school   
 starts at 8.55.We have an assembly and
 prayers,we go back to the classroom   
 and we do some maths or English.They  
 help you to do sums and talk and      
 write.We have break which is when you 
 stop work and play and talk.Then back 
 to work and we would do some topic    
 work or watch the television.Then it  
 is time for lunch and playtime.       
 Afterwards we might have P.E. or      
 science or a music lesson or a talk   
 then we would have break.After that we
 might have a quiet reading or sewing  
 or library period which is when you   
 choose a book and you give it back in 
 a week.Then the bell would go and it  
 meant school is over and I would go   
 home.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
