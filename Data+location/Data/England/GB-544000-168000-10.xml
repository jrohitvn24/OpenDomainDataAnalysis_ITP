		<content>Most of the houses close to the        
Walsingham School were originally built
by the Council,but many have been      
bought by the occupiers and are now    
privately owned.These have been        
improved by changing windows and       
doors,adding garages and building      
extensions onto the original house.In  
roads like St.Pauls Wood Hill,a lot of 
money has been spent on making them    
look nice by pebble-dashing and adding 
porches.                               
There are a few detached houses and    
bungalows,many more semi-detached and  
terraced houses and flats.Nearly all   
the houses have reasonably sized       
gardens.Most houses and gardens are    
well kept,but there is the odd scruffy 
house.There are a few garages.Most     
roads are busy and have cars parked at 
the kerb,but there is plenty of green  
space around to make the area pleasant.</content>
