		<content>   Most people who were interviewed in 
{Horsley High Street}lived locally.    
 There is no big supermarket in Horsley
 so people who do not live locally     
 have no need to go into the area.For  
 main{shopping}people prefer to travel 
 to Guildford, Cobham or Leatherhead   
 for a wider selection of shops.       
   Many of the shoppers said that they 
 came to live in Horsley because it is 
 quiet,attractive and has clean air.The
{houses}therefore are expensive.An     
 example of this is a semi-detatched   
{three bedroomed house}would cost from 
{Â£70,000.}There are many{amenities}such
 as:tennis courts and a golf club plus 
 it has good medical and educational   
 facilities.
