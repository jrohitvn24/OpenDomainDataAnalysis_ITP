		<content>      Farlow Church of England         
 (Controlled) Primary School has 61    
 children in three classes taught by   
 three full time teachers including the
 Headteacher who teaches the Upper     
 Junior class. The main building, built
 in the 1850's, houses the infant class
 and the Lower Junior class. The Upper 
 Junior class is housed in a second    
 hand portable classroom, which has    
 been at Farlow for 14 years.          
      The Domesday Survey work has been
 done on our BBC computer which was    
 provided by the Parent Teacher        
 Association. We also have  "My        
 Talking Computer" and  "Big trac"     
 computer education equipment.         
      There are 16 children in the     
 lower junior class, 17 children in the
 infant class and 28 children in the   
 upper junior class.
