		<title>18  My Life in Wolverhampton</title>
		<content>In my spare time I go to my friends. We
either play cards or make camps.On Wed-
nesdays and Thursdays I go Asda to     
spend my mom and dad's or uncle's      
money.If I stop in I spend my time eat-
ing lots of beefburgers,icecream,bacon,
sausages and pizzas. If it is raining I
go out and get wet or play my records. 
If Mark comes round we get the bricks  
and make army bases. On Friday,Saturday
and Sunday I go to the club with my mom
and dad to play bingo. I don't really  
like it but it gets me out the house.  
Sometimes I sneak in a club over the   
road and get kicked out about 10.30pm. 
Some nights I go on the CB radio to    
eyeball people. The next night I go to 
where I said I would eyeball them and  
talk to them.The last eyeball I had was
to meet a boy at the Red Lion.Sometimes
I go swimming at Bushbury or Swancote  
Baths.I often stop all day at the baths</content>
