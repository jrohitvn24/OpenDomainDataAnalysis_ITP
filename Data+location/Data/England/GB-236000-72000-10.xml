{THIRTEENTH CENTURY.}ALL THE{ROOFS}ARE 
 THE{ORIGINAL FIFTEENTH CENTURY}ONES   
 EXCEPT THE CHANCEL ROOF. THE ROOF OVER
 THE ALTARS WERE PAINTED BLUE, WHEN AN 
 OFFER BY THE{DUKE OF WINDSOR,}THEN    
{PRINCE OF WALES}TO HAVE THE WORK DONE 
 WAS GRATEFULLY ACCEPTED.{THE BLUE AND

{WESTMINSTER ABBEY}FOR THE{CORONATION  
{OF QUEEN ELIZABETH II,}AND WERE GIVEN 
 TO THE CHURCH BY HER MAJESTY. THE     
 BELLS WERE CAST BY THE PENNINGTONS OF
