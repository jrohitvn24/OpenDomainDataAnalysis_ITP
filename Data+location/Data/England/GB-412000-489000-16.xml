		<title>16LIVING IN SPENNITHORNE.</title>
		<content> THE MAIN CHANGES I HAVE SEEN IN HARMBY
 AND SPENNITHORNE IN THE LAST 20       
 YEARSHAVE BEEN THE INCREASE IN        
 POPULATION AND THE DECLINE IN THE BUS 
 SERVICE.HARMBY NOW HAS TWO BUNGALOW   
 ESTATES WITH MANY PEOPLE RETIRING TO  
 THE AREA.IN SPENNITHORNE MANY         
 BUILDINGSHAVE BEEN CONVERTED TO       
 HOLIDAY ACCOMMODATION.                
  WITH SUCH AN INFREQUENT BUS SERVICE  
 MY LIFE WOULD BE VERY DIFFERENT IF I  
 WAS UNABLE TO DRIVE.I AM ABLE TO TAKE 
 MY CHILDREN TO ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE 
 VILLAGE AND GO SHOPPING ETC. WHENEVER 
 I WISH. NON-DRIVERS ARE NOT SO LUCKY. 
  LIVING HERE I HAVE THE PEACE AND     
 QUIETOF THE COUNTRYSIDE WITH PLENTY OF
 THINGS TAKING PLACE IN THE TWO        
 VILLAGES:YET WE ARE NOT TOO FAR FROM  
 SEVERAL LARGE TOWNS AND THEIR         
 FACILITIES.
