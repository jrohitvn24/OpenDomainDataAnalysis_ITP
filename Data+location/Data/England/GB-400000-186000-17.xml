		<content>    If a mother is at home with young  
 children and no transport, except when
 husband is home from work, she feels  
 very isolated particularly if         
 relations are not nearby.             
    In a remote area it is important   
 that Local Authority Services are     
 aware of such families. For instance, 
 the Health Visitor can arrange        
 transport to take toddlers to Play    
 Group in local village. Also voluntary
 helpers from the Play Group visit     
 mothers and children at home to chat  
 and get to know each other and their  
 needs.                                
    Mothers appreciate such support    
 which helps them cope with everyday   
 problems.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
