 "My name is Raymond Gates.  I moved to
 Harlow six years ago from Walthamstow.
 My aunt already lived in Harlow. My   
 dad is a lorry driver and he still

 There are four in our family. My mum, 
 dad and older sister, Tracy.  We live 
 in a three-bedroom house on an estate 
 called The Maples.  All the houses    
 there are Canadian design and a few

 are still standing.                   
 I am a 3rd year in my junior school   
 and there are 29 children in our      
 class.  My favourite subject is maths

 my own sandwiches. At dinner time I
