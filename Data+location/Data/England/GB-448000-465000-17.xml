 is quite flat in the housing area,but 
 the countryside is hilly in some parts
 and flat in others.It is a mixture of 
 sand and clay and is good farm land.  
  Most farms in the area are mixed     
 farms. They keep sheep and cows  and  
 there  is a Stud Farm for breeding    
 horses, and several pig units .       
 Farmers grow potatoes and some are    
 sent  to crisps  and frozen food      
 producers.Silage and hay are collected
 for winter feed .Sugar beet is sent to
 the sugar factory at York . Barley is 
 used for brewing  and animal feed.    
 Turnips and mangolds are used for     
 animal feed in winter.
