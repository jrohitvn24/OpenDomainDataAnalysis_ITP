 saddlers, and a{public house (1871).} 
 The{most recent business}is that of an
{estate agent}opened{1985. }           
     To-day all businesses report that 
{trade is increasing.}Approximately 50%
 of those employed live in Crowthorne, 
 the largest number being employed by a
 supermarket.{50% of the businesses use
{a computer}and{30% take young people  
{on Youth Training Schemes.}Some feel  
 there is a need for more shops and    
 car parking places.                   
     Permission has been granted for a 
 three storey block of flats, offices  
 and shops with an additional 42 car
