		<title>14The Post Office</title>
		<content> Sale General Post Office has a very   
 busy sorting office which opens from  
 5.15am until 12.57pm. Our guides      
 explained that boxes with red labels  
 are for first class letters and boxes 
 with green labels are for second class
 letters. First class are franked in a 
 machine with the time and date but    
 second class only with the date. About
 3000 letters a day pass through the   
 machine. They are sorted into "pigeon 
 holes". A postman's round is called a 
 walk and a van's route a track. There 
 are fifty eight walks in Sale. Twenty 
 six thousand houses are delivered to. 
 There are fifty eight pilar boxes.    
 About two thousand businesses receive 
 letters. One hundred and fifty pounds 
 is taken weekly from 'phone boxes and 
 the coins are counted and separated in
 a machine in the Post Office.
