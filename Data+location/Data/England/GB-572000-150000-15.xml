		<title>15Leisure in the Coxheath area</title>
		<content> Although a large "urban" area,        
 Coxheath has little to offer in the   
 way of leisure.  Two public houses in 
 the centre, "The Bell" and the "Bird  
 in Hand" provide the only facilities  
 for "going out".  Most of the other   
 forms of leisure activities take place
 in or around the Village Hall (see    
 page 9).  Brownies, Guides, Scouts and
 Cubs meet regularly in the hut in     
 Westerhill Road.                      
 For the young, there is a play area at
 the back of the Village Hall and the  
 woods nearby provide extra play space.
 Coxheath and Farleigh boys football   
 club meet regularly during the season 
 and a gym club operates at the Junior 
 School.  The local branch of the Young
 Ornithologists Club meets at Heath    
 House on Heath Road on Tuesdays.
