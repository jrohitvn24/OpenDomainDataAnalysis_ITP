		<title>07Village of Southwick</title>
		<content> Housing in Southwick has several      
 common characteristics. Most buildings
 have two storeys with large back      
 gardens, and little or no front       
 gardens. They can be divided into 3   
 categories; the very old thatched     
 cottages with large plots of land,    
 pre-2nd World War terraced houses,    
 made of flint, whose doors open right 
 onto the road, and the post war houses
 made of red brick. There is also an   
 estate of such houses on the edge of  
 Southwick.{The village has grown very 
{little because it is owned by         
{Southwick Estate.                     
 There seems to be a preference to use 
 hedgerows as barriers which are       
 abundant in wild flora. At the        
 southern end of Southwick, and{old    
{flint bridge}crosses the Wallington   
 river.
