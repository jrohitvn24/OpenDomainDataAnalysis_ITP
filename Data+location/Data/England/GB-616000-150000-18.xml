		<title>18THE CHURCHES</title>
		<content> The Anglican Churches of St. Mary's,  
 Bishopsbourne, and St. Giles, Kingston
 are both architecturally noteworthy.  
 The Rev. Richard Hooker, author of    
 "The Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity",  
 was Vicar of St.Mary's from 1595-1600.
 "Hooker's Hedge", a 15ft. yew hedge,  
 still exists today. Because of the    
 decline in church attendance and lack 
 of finance, both parishes share an in-
 cumbent with Barham. This means that  
 there is rarely more than one service 
 in each church on Sundays. There is a 
 choir at both churches and a Sunday   
 School at Kingston. The Parochial     
 Church Councils, comprising the Rector
 two Churchwardens and 10 elected lay  
 members meet four times a year to deal
 with church affairs. Members of both  
 congregations help with the cleaning  
 and upkeep, and organise fund-raising 
 events to provide extra vital income. </content>
