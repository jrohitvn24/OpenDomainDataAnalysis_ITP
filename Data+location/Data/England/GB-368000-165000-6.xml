		<title>06AVON WALKWAY WEST OF BATH</title>
		<content>{The Avon Walkway}is a rough riverside 
 path and an excellent walk for a      
 naturalist.The first part borders farm
 land but later it goes through thin   
 woodland.There are numerous insects   
 such as dragonflies and damselflies.At
 many points the banks are eroding     
 causing over-hangs.There are lots of  
 different flowers the main ones being 
 dandilions,nettles,clover,buttercups, 
 cowparsley,white dead nettles,cat mint
 ,thistles,comfrey,pink campian,forget 
 me nots,rushes and wild garlic.There  
 are lots of hazel trees but there are 
 sycamore and willow trees.Crossing the
 walkway is a railway bridge which is  
 now a cycle track.Canal barges and    
 boats use the river mostly at weekends
 .There is also private fishing.There  
 is a marina with a cafe.I would       
 recommend this to anyone who likes    
 walking.                              </content>
