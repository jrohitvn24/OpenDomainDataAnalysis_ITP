		<title>20CHEDDAR CAVES</title>
		<content> There have been{caves}in Cheddar for  
 thousands of years but not like the   
 ones the tourists visit. Originally   
 they were home for cavemen and        
 animals. People were still living in  
 them at the turn of the twentieth     
 century.{Visitors}have been coming to 
 Cheddar for decades to see the cliffs 
 and original caves. There were always 
 poor people living in them and in     
 cottages in the gorge who were only   
 too pleased to make a few pennies by  
 showing them around using candlelight 
 Then in 1837 the first of the show    
 caves was discovered by a man called  
 George Cox.}He sent a workman         
 across the hillside to fetch some     
 rocks and after a period of time his  
 workman failed to return. George found
 him in a gaping hole in the ground    
 from which led the chambers of the    
{Cox's cave system.                    </content>
