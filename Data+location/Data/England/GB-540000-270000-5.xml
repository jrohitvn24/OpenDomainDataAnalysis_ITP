{housing}in Willingham. The main High  
 Street consists of ribbon development 
 with some{19th C.}dwellings. Infilling
 is taking place on vacant plots with  
 brick-built detached houses. Most of  
 the houses in the village are         
 privately owned. There are groups of  
{council houses}in Wilford Furlong,    
 Haden Way, Fen End and Long Lane.

 but there are some town houses in Long
 Lane and terraced houses in Fen End.
