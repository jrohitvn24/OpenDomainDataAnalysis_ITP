		<title>03The Delaval Curse.</title>
		<content> The{curse}said that while the Delavals
 owned both the estates of Ford and    
 Delaval, no male Delaval would die    
 peacefully in his bed. The first to be
 affected by the curse was Francis     
 himself. In 1759 he fell down some    
 steps at Delaval Hall, and died.      
 His eldest son, Francis, died in      
 Delaval Hall after a wild bout of     
 eating and drinking.                  
 Of the later male Delavals, Thomas    
 fell from a horse, Robert and Henry   
 died in a battle overseas, George was 
 drowned at sea and Ralph was killed in
 an earthquake in Lisbon.              
 In 1814, Edward Delaval survived the  
 curse and died peacefully in his bed, 
 by which time, the estate at Ford had 
 passed from the Delaval family!       
 We found some of this information on a
 trip to Northumberland County Archive 
 (see page 4).                         </content>
