		<title>04Coleshill,rivers and ponds.</title>
		<content> Coleshill has two rivers,one which it 
 derives its name from-the Cole        
 and the river Blythe which flows to   
 the east of the town.The river Cole   
 has had its course altered and        
 straightened a lot to try to reduce   
 the flooding in Cole End.The mill,mill
 house,leet and ford have all gone.The 
 river Blythe is an unspoiled river    
 which meanders throuhg the countryside
 with many pastures arount it used for 
 for grazing of cattle.Fishing contests
 are held regularly on the Blythe and  
 swans are seen regularly.The old      
{" Stonebridge Railway}"travelled along
 the valley and crossed the Blythe     
 several times.Most of the bridges have
 been dismantled but some footpaths    
 follow the track.There are still many 
 ponds in the area,some quite big,some 
 filled in.Some dry up in summer.The   
 rivers and ponds are used for watering</content>
