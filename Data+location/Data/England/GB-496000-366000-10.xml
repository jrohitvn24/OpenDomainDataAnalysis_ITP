		<title>10ALL SAINTS CHURCH,BRANT RD.</title>
		<content> Between the years 1013-1066 Lincoln   
 was under the rule of the Danes.The   
 city had 50 years of peace and in     
 these years it was the centre of      
 international trade.It was in these   
 years that All-Saints was built.{The  
{nave}was built in this period.Its four
 corners can still be seen (3 from the 
 outside)and the blocked up north door 
 was built in this period but was reset
 stone by stone when the aisle was     
 built on.{In 1066}the tower was built 
 on to the nave in late Saxon /early   
 Norman style.The chancel arch was     
 probably built at the same time.The   
 church was enlarged in Early English  
 style in the 13th century.The south   
 aisle was built and its pillars were a
 copy from the cathedral.The Chancel   
 was lengthened and the altar could no 
 longer be seen from the nave.The 2    
 windows in the chancel made at then.  </content>
