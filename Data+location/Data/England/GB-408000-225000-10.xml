		<content> When we went up Mill Lane we found 13 
 different kinds of tree,1 conigerous  
 and 12 deciduous. We kept on walking  
 and identified 28 spring flowering    
 plants, 11 summer flowering,7 Autumn  
 flowering.                            
 There are many different plants living
 along the River Windrush which flows  
 through the block and a completely    
 different set of plants living around 
 the dry stone walls in the area.      
 Mnay wild animals also live in the    
 area including rats, fieldmice,       
 woodmice, harvestmice, rabbits,       
 hares,foxes,badgers,stoats,deer,wild  
 cats to name just a few.              
 We have very little pollution in the  
 area as we have no factories and      
 little traffic passing through.
