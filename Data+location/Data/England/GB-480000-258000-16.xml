		<content>   In the Domesday Book Brafield is    
 referred to as{BRACHEFIELD}or         
{BRAGEFELDE.                           
   Its history goes back to the days   
 when William the Conqueror gave 3     
 virgates of land (approx. 90 acres) to
 his niece{Countess Judith.            
   Subsequently, Norman Knights became 
 Lords of the Manor. In Medieval       
 times the church of St. Laurence was  
 passed to the Crown. From 1838-1894   
 the Lord of the Manor was also the    
 vicar of the Parish Church. He spent  
 freely on the church and erected the  
 village school close by.              
   Brafield was once described as the  
{roughest village}in Northamptonshire. 
 It gained this infamous reputation    
 during the "Cottage Industry" days of 
 the boot and shoe industry. Fights in 
 the local public house were regular   
 affairs on pay days.                  </content>
