 Saxon times.Where St.Andrews church   
 stands was an old wooden one built by 
 Cuthman before{1066.}The present one  
 was built by the Normans in the{12thC.
 It has beautiful arches and lovely    
 organ pipes.There are houses of all   
 times in history.A brick and timber   
 gabled prison or stone house is       
 thought to be early{14thC.}One of the 
 oldest is the Chequer Inn, believed to
 be early{15thC.}and a famous coaching 
 house. The Saxon Cottage is probably  
{16thC.}and is made completely without 
 nails,with a thickly thatched catslide
 roof almost to the ground. Brotherhood
 hall is a{15thC.}tile hung house, now 
 The Grammar School. Opposite is the   
 Norfolk Arms which in the{17thC.}was a
 private house. This house has a       
 Jacobean staircase hand carved and in 
 perfect condition.                    </content>
