 automatically by electronic machine   
 with a digital readout, which is      
 clearly displayed in the front of the 
 vehicle.  Hartlepool transport        
 authority sets the costs per mile     
 which all operators must charge.      
      Daytime fares, 6.30a.m. -        
 11.30p.m. are at present 50p for the  
 first half mile and 10p for each      
 subsequent sixth of the first mile,   
 equal to 80p for the first mile and   
 60p for each mile there after.  Night 
 time fares, 11.30p.m. - 6.30a.m. are  
 50p for the first third mile, 10p for 
 each ninth of a mile, equal to Â£1.10p 
 for the first mile and 90p for each
