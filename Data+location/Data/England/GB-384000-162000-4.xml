		<content> As in most rural districts this area  
 has a three-tier system of local      
 government ie Parish Council, District
 Council and County Council. The two   
 parishes in this area are in the West 
 Wilts. District. The Parish Councils  
 have little real power and act mainly 
 as an advisory body on local affairs  
 to District and County Councils.      
 A local rate is levied and used for   
 cemetary maintenance, street lighting 
 and miscellaneous items.              
 Broughton Gifford is different from   
 many parish councils as it is also the
 Lord of the Manor and owns the Common 
 in the north of the village. The      
 administration of the Common and the  
 adjudication of squabbles, between    
 villagers and people with common      
 rights, usually consumes much of the  
 time at Parish Council meetings.
