		<content> In the playground my favourite game is
 Tiggy Scarecrow.You play Tiggy        
 Scarecrow like this, you get your     
 friends and one has to be on.The one  
 that is on has to catch you and if she
 does you have stand like a scarecrow  
 and when one of your friends goes     
 under your legs you are free and you  
 run until you get caught again.My     
 favourite game in school is           
 Shipwreck.You play it by swimming in  
 the sea and when someone shouts       
 Shipwreck you have to jump on to a    
 mat.The last one in the sea is        
 out.Another game is kissing catch.You 
 catch girls then you kiss them.My     
 favourite game at home is football.You
 have a football and some nets and you 
 get the football in the nets by       
 kicking it.The side that scores the   
 most goals wins.
