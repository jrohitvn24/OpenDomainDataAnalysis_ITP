		<title>07ALTHAM PUMPING STATION</title>
		<content> The pumping station was opened in     
 1908. It supplies fresh water to the  
 Hyndburn and Burnley areas.  Betsy,   
 the steam engine, pumped water from 4 
 deep bore holes. The water was then   
 purified. New machinery was installed 
 in 1955 and the station was re-opened 
 in 1957. The station operates         
 throughout the year and employs 10    
 men, of whom 9 work around the        
 district.                             
 The former corn mill is now a self-   
 sufficient housing cooperative.       
 A new industrial estate has been built
 with the help of a grant from the     
 E.E.C.  Businesses include:           
  Wholesale toiletry and medicines     
  Manufacture of salt gritting machines
  Graphic arts                         
  Textile weaving                      
  Building of road tankers             
  Horse shoe nail making.              </content>
