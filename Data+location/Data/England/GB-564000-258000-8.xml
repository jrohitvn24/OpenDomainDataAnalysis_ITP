		<title>08Stetchworth Primary School</title>
		<content> Stetchworth County Primary School was 
 built by Lord Ellesmere in 1897.It is 
 a small rural school with 49          
 children,2 full time teachers, Mr     
 Tallack,the Headteacher,and Mrs       
 Nickerson and 2 part time teachers.   
 There are two classrooms and another  
 room which is used as a library and   
 dining room.There is also a kitchen   
 although meals are no longer cooked on
 the premises.We still have outside    
 toilets.Also outside is the playground
 and a grassed area with a swimming    
 pool and climbing frame.The inside of 
 the school has recently been          
 redecorated and new lighting and power
 points have been installed.           
 When children leave this school at    
 11,they normally transfer to Bottisham
 Village College.
