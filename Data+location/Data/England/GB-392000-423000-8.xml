		<title>08The Todmorden Show</title>
		<content>   Each year in Todmorden we have an   
 agricultural show in the park. People 
 come to the show from all over the    
 north of England to see well known    
 show jumpers, quaulifying for Wembley.
   This year there were dog shows,     
 sheep shearing and bull showing.The   
 big tents had goats, rabbits and hens 
 and there was a handicraft tent in    
 which people entered sewing, painting 
 and cakes for prizes.In the rabbit    
 tent, one was in a glass bowl, because
 the owner didn't want anyone to touch 
 it, as it was so white and fluffy.    
   There was also a fair, a beer tent, 
 a buffet tent and a St.John Ambulance 
 tent, along with ice cream vans, fish 
 &amp; chip vans, sweet stalls and alot of 
 noise.This year there was a fight with
 some drunken people,from out of town, 
 but the police stopped it.
