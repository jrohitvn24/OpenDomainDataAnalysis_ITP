		<title>18HOME LIFE - Saturday</title>
		<content>   Woken by the telephone at 8am l lay 
 in bed listening to  Radio One and    
 savouring the smell of Dad's favourite
 breakfast- bacon, egg, mushrooms and  
 sausage. l went downstairs to eat my  
 cornflakes + then returned to tidy my 
 room and have a bath.                 
   Mummy, Daddy and sister motored to  
 Lymington to shop. My other sister    
 practised the bassoon. At 12.30 l went
 to my weekend job at a local hotel.   
 When l returned at 6pm Mummy had      
 finished the housework and was        
 gardening while Daddy was cutting the 
 grass.                                
   Our supper was stew with dumplings  
 followed by ice-cream and hot         
 chocolate sauce. We helped to wash up 
 then watched the TV until 10pm when we
 went to bed.
