		<title>01Stonegate-A Wealden Village</title>
		<content> The small village of Stonegate is     
 situated about nine miles south-east  
 of Tunbridge Wells,occupying a ridge  
 between the valleys of the rivers     
 Rother and Lymden.                    
 The geology of the area consists of   
 clay and sandstone,with some of this  
 stone being used,in the past,for      
 building.                             
 The land is mainly used for           
 agriculture,with a mixture of         
 arable,cattle,sheep and hop farming.  
 There is no bus service to the        
 village,the nearest route being about 
 four kilometres away on the main      
 Wadhurst-Ticehurst road.              
 The railway station,about one         
 kilometre from the village,is on the  
 main line between Hastings and        
 London,but the service from Stonegate 
 is infrequent outside the "rush-hour."
