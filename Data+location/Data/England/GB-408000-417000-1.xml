		<content>  In the 12km block covered,the village
 of{Outlane}is the highest inhabited   
 settlement. It rises to a height of   
 288m at one point. The village is     
 mainly residential with a mixture of  
 old and new housing. Near the village 
 is the old settlement of Slack and the
 site of a Roman Fort. A golf course   
 covers the land immediately to the    
 south east of the M62 motorway.       
{ Holywell Green}and{Blackley}are both 
 small, quiet villages to the north of 
 Outlane.{Salendine Nook}and{Lindley } 
 are mainly residential.               
  Perhaps the most important feature of
 the whole 12km block is the{M62}      
 motorway.
