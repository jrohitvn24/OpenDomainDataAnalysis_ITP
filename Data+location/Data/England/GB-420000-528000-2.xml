    In 1968{Woodhouse Close Swimming   
{Baths}were opened.At this time there  
 was only a{swimming pool,but in recent
 years the addition of a{sauna,jaccuzi 
 and{sunbed suite}has been made. Only  
 this year another addition of{squash  
{courts}has been built. Also, a{snooker
{room, multi-purpose room, fitness room
 and a{cafe}have been built.           
    When we visited the complex we were
 shown the{new facilities}and how they 
 work by the manager Mr.Owen. The      
 jaccuzi or spa pool is used by people 
 who want to relax in the hot,bubbly   
 water,while the sauna cleanses the    
 skin at a high temperature. People    
 usually go in the spa pool after the  
 sauna so as to cool down. The new     
 facilities were to be opened the      
 following Saturday,June 29.
