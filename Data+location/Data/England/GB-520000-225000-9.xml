{HENRY TRIGG}was not a poor man and he 
 made his living as a grocer.One night 
 Henry and two freinds saw  a band of  
 body snatchers snatching a body that  
 had just been experimented on.So when 
 he died he was put on the rafters of  
 his barn so he had less chance of     
 getting his body snatched.He had      
 strange ideas and whims. The barn at  
 the back of his house is now a bank   
 called{National Westminster}.When he  
 died his will was to give his         
 relations 10 shillings each and good  
 freinds got 5 shillings.{Henry}was a  
 church warden at St {Nicholas church. 
 It is still possible to see the old   
 coffin in the rafters of a small barn 
 at rear of the Bank though the remains
 of old Henry have been removed.
