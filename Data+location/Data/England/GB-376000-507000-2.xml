		<content>{Kirkby Stephen}is quite a{long,narrow 
{town}which spread south in the late   
 C19 towards the railway station with  
{small terraces &amp; typical Victorian    
{houses}mainly built of the local      
{Brockram rock.}There are two small    
 estates of{council built houses.      
 Recently some tenants bought their    
 homes from the council.Only a{few     
{private houses}and bungalows have been
 built in{recent years}&amp; a number of   
 old farm buildings have been{converted
 into houses.The{Grammar School}(comp- 
 rehensive)opened in 1955 replacing the
 Girls' G.S. The{Primary School}built  
 in 1877 is still in use but most      
 classes are in one of the three       
 temporary buildings. Plans for a      
 replacement school have again been    
 postponed. The large &amp; fine{Parish    
{Church,}extended in Victorian times,  
 occupies the site of a Saxon church.  </content>
