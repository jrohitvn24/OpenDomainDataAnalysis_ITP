		<content> Today we visited a farm of 61 acres   
 which has a herd of 42 Friesian       
 milking cows.First of all we saw how  
 the cows were milked.We put our thumbs
 into the clusters.It felt as if you   
 had put your hand on the end of a     
 vacuum cleaner,except that it did not 
 suck as hard.Then the farmer showed us
 the pipes that carried the milk to the
 place where it is kept until the milk-
 tanker arrives.The place where it is  
 kept is a big rectangular tank.The    
 milk is chilled and then kept cool by 
 refridgeration.The tank holds 878     
 litres,and is usually about three     
 quarters full after milking.This does 
 not vary much as there is all year    
 round calving.We were there when the  
 milk tanker came.The driver used a    
 metal rod to measure the depth of     
 milk,before he piped it out into his  
 tanker.                               </content>
