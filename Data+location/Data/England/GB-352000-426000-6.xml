		<content> Every{morning}when it is school I     
 get up out of bed at 7.45a.m. I get   
 washed and dressed. When I have       
 straightened my bed I go down stairs  
 for my breakfast and I usually have   
 cornflakes.After my breakfast I get   
 ready for school and go.I walk there. 
   When I am at{school}we get ready for
 assembly and go into the hall.After   
 assembly I come back into the         
 classroom and do some work.At ten     
 o'clock we usually do some maths, and 
 at 10.30p.m. it is time to go home.   
   Every{weekend}I get up later than I 
 do in the week. I get up between      
 9.00 a.m. and 10.a.m.We go to town for
 some shopping.Sometimes I have my     
 dinner in a cafe in town. When it is a
 nice day I sunbathe or I play with my 
 sister.When it is about 5.00p.m. we go
 in for tea and after it I help to     
 clean up.I usually go to bed at 10.00.</content>
