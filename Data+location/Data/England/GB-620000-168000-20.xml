		<content>   We talked to quite a few people     
about their spare time activities.Lots 
of grown-ups said they were usually    
busy around the house, gardening and   
DIY being most popular.In the summer   
most people liked to visit the beach   
and swimming in the sea was especially 
popular with the children.Fishing is   
another popular pastime amongst young  
and old.                               
   For most leisure activities people  
 end to travel out of the area: to     
Canterbury for the swimming pool and   
into Herne Bay for sports              
activities,drama and operatic          
socities,sailing clubs,gymnastics clubs
and sports teams such as roller hockey,
hockey, netball and football.Many      
activities in our block are for older  
people such as gardening clubs and     
associations for retired people.
