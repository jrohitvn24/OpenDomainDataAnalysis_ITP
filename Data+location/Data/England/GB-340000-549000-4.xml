		<title>04BEEF CATTLE _BRISCO HALL FM.</title>
		<content> Brisco Hall Farm is a farm which rears
 cattle for beef.Most of the farms in  
 this area are dairy farms,however,and 
 much smaller.                         
 The cows which Mr.Coulthard has are   
 mainly Herefords but he has Aberdeen  
 Angus,Simmental and Charolais bulls   
 which he uses for breeding.           
   {********************************}  
 Mr.Coulthard thinks that,although many
 farmers were not very sure at first   
 about joining the E.E.C.,they would   
 have been in much trouble now if      
 Britain had voted against it.The      
 E.E.C. rules had not affected him very
 much and there were many advantages   
 such as increased trade and improved  
 co_operation.                         
 Most farmers agree that the biggest   
 changes in the industry have been;    
 greater dependence on machinery,      
 intensification and more productivity.</content>
