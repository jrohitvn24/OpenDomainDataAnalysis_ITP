		<content> Farming on the rather poor soil of    
 this area is quite varied and must    
 depend on the degree of cultivation   
 and fertilisation. Much is grassland  
 or even rough grazing given over to   
 horses. Farms or holdings are small.  
 Several herds of cattle but few       
 heifers and milking cows are noted,   
 also two flocks of sheep, one very    
 small. Near Liphook wheat and oats    
 were harvested. In one of the other   
 few arable fields, the crop was       
 potatoes. From the highest ground in  
 the NE, an apple orchard on SW slope  
 continues to prosper, 'Cox' being one 
 of the varieties grown.               
  The majority of households own a dog.
  A kennels and cattery advertises     
 boarding facilities, shampooing, etc..
  Roe deer traverse the area eating    
 choice shoots in gardens. Rabbits     
 threaten to increase.                 </content>
