		<title>10Thame Trade</title>
		<content>Thame offers a variety of trades. The  
High St. contains many shops of every  
description.One of the shops today is  
Taurus China Shop in Bullingdon House. 
The building is about 300 years old    
and was originally an old coaching inn.
The house contains cellars which were  
wine cellars, but are now used as      
storage rooms for china. Mrs Martin,   
the owner of the shop, showed us a     
large  selection of china pieces, some 
of which are made locally.             
{Possible Closure of the Cattle Market}
Thame has had a cattle market since the
13th century and this has served the   
local community. Although the Tuesday  
market will still operate, many farmers
are strongly opposed to the closure of 
the cattle market, which has been an   
integral part of the towns life for    
centuries.
