		<title>16Miners in Cliffe</title>
		<content>      There are not yet many miners    
 living in Cliffe, although the Selby  
 Coalfield is being developed. One of  
 the mine shafts is at Whitemoor in the
 north of Cliffe Parish, but outside   
 the area covered by this survey.      
      The Selby District Council has   
 a plan for some land in Cliffe to be  
 used for miner's houses if they want  
 to come. But not many do want to come 
 because the village is too quiet.     
      Some older people in the village 
 do not want miners to come, because   
 they think the place will be a lot    
 noisier, and some younger people do   
 not want to live near miners. But some
 others think it would be a good idea  
 if the village was bigger. There would
 be more shops, more entertainment, and
 better transport. Perhaps the railway 
 station would be re-opened.
