		<title>11Businesses Around Ufton.</title>
		<content>                                       
  There are three established          
businesses in the area around Ufton:   
    1. The Fox And Hen Public House    
    2. Grestones Boarding Kennels      
    3. Stoneythorpe Riding Stables     
  The Fox and Hen at Bascote Heath     
draws customers from surrounding towns.
The trade is very seasonal because of  
its isolated position.It may have to   
serve food in order to survive,        
especially in winter. Summer trade is  
good and a special feature is a fort-  
nightly jazz evening.                  
  The boarding kennels takes dogs,cats 
and rabbits. It is a recent venture for
a redundant couple from Birmingham who 
also breed dogs.                       
  The riding stables is on the A425 and
attracts customers from a wide area. It
is still a working farm.
