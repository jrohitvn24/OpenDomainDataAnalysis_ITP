		<title>19POLITICS IN PURTON STOKE</title>
		<content>  In Purton Stoke 2 Parish Councillors 
 were needed.So an election was held on
 the 4th July 1985.                    
  Richard John Scott swept to victory  
 by receiving 153 votes, but the       
 Liberal candidate Alan Ronald Timpson 
 only received 66 votes.               
  The remaining candidates consisted of
 James Sebastian Caslaw with 60 votes; 
 John Stuart Rainbow,36 votes; and     
 Terrence Robert Giles,22 votes.       
  The by_elections were called suddenly
 due to the shock death of Councillor  
 David Evans and also the resignation  
 of Councillor Dorothy Dunn .          
  The next meeting of the Parish       
 Council was August 5.                 
 A bill posted on a telegraph pole by  
 the post office and an article in the 
 Wootton Bassett Standard,Friday July  
 12,gave us this information.
