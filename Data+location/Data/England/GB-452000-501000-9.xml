		<title>09A FOREST RANGER'S DAY</title>
		<content> It is still dusk at 4am, &amp; after a cup
 of tea &amp; filling my flask with coffee,
 I collect the food that was made up   
 last night &amp; make my way to the       
 forest. Deer contol is my calling. Two
 year old roe deer bucks do the most   
 fraying on young trees. After two     
 hours &amp; having seen one buck, I go off
 to another area of forest to visit    
 grey squirrel hoppers &amp; traps. Wheat  
 treated with an anticoagulant liquid  
 is fed in these hoppers to control the
 grey squirrels, which do much damage  
 by stripping off bark. I have some    
 food at about 9.30 am and then go on  
 to further hoppers &amp; move some to     
 other sites, inspect some fences,     
 shoot 3 rabbits, &amp; get home for 2pm.I 
 eat &amp; rest, fill up the forest        
 ranger's diary &amp; feed the ferret and  
 my dog in the evening.
