		<content>{Sticky toffee}is a simple game and you
 need at least seven children to play  
 but it is better with more.           
 One or two people are the catchers and
 their job is to catch everybody.Once  
 you have been caught you must stand in
 one place with your legs wide open    
 until someone goes between your legs  
 to let you play the game again.The    
 game ends when everyone is standing   
 with their legs open.I like it because
 it is a very fast game.               
{40,40}Before you start you have to    
 decide what is going to be the        
 base.First of all decide who is going 
 to be the seeker.He counts to fourty  
 while the rest of the people hide and 
 he has to find them.Once spotted he   
 runs back to base and says 40,40 I see
 "name".If the person can out run the  
 seeker and touch the base and say     
 40,40 he is in.Great fun.             </content>
