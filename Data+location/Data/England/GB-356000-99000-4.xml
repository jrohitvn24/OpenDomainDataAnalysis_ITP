		<content> The Village Hall was built in 1926 on 
 the site of some old stables and named
 the Savile Hall in memory of Francis  
 Ewart Savile, a local landowner who   
 was killed in the 1st World War, and  
 who left a large sum of money which   
 was used to build the hall in stone.  
 The Fox and Hounds Inn is a small     
 village pub with one bar and a small  
 room with pool table and a modern     
 skittle alley.   Bar snacks are served
 and occasional bed and breakfast      
 visitors catered for.   The skittle   
 alley has two teams;  there are two   
 darts teams, one ladies and one mens. 
 There are also two cribbage teams and 
 also general knowledge teams.         
 The stables of the Cattistock Hunt are
 in the centre of the village, with the
 kennels accommodated on the hillside  
 to the east of the village.
