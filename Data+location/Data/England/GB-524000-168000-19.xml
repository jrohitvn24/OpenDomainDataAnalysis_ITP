		<title>19What life's like in Morden</title>
		<content> I really like it where I live because 
 its not too noisy and not quiet.We    
 know nearly everybody in our street   
 and we are always talking over fences 
 and gardens.                          
  Over the back of our houses people   
 are putting up new houses.This really 
 makes me mad because it used to be    
 a big field which everybody used to   
 use for playing in, giving their dogs 
 a good run in, for the Youth Club,    
 football club on Sundays and in the   
 summer blackberries and straw berries 
 grew there.Now the fields are a       
 mess.There's guttering,pipes,planks of
 wood and even machines left           
 everywhere.Last year when they had    
 just started digging up the ground a  
 mechanical digger was switched on by  
 some children, driven around and left 
 on all night.A big sort of garage has 
 now been put up {    continued        </content>
