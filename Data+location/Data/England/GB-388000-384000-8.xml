		<content> The area around Moorfield School has  
 changed greatly in the last thirty    
 years. Where there are now rows of    
 houses, there were open fields. The   
 shops were small independent stores   
 which provided a delivery service to  
 customers. The milkman travelled by   
 horse and cart.  Mirlees Blackstone   
 Engineering was the main employer in  
 the area.  One zebra crossing was     
 sufficient for pedestrians using the  
 A6. The train service into Manchester 
 had been withdrawn soon after the war.
   Other schools were Norbury C. of E. 
 and Hazel Grove Junior School. The    
 High School on Jacksons Lane was in   
 existence as a secondary school. As   
 farming land was sold, new housing    
 estates sprang up and the Junior and  
 Infant schools, and St.Peter's        
 Catholic school were built to cater   
 for the growing school population.    </content>
