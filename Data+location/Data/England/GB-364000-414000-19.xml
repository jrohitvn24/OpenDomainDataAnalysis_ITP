		<title>19FISH FARMING</title>
		<content> Behind Maria Sqare in Belmont         
 there are{ponds}where fish are        
 farmed.The owners feed the{fish       
 on natural food and B.P. trout        
 pellets.They keep golden orfe, koi    
 carp, tench and rudd.There are four   
 ponds and in one of them is the       
 largest fish of all, called the       
 ghost koi, which shivers along the    
 bottom of the pond.It weighs about    
 six pounds.                           
 The owners have about 2,000 fish but  
 hope to have 50,000 when they{breed.  
 The fish are sold from 70p to Â£40.    
{Trade}is good with at least 1,000     
 customers a year coming to buy        
 fish.This fish farm is one of four in 
 the United Kingdom that breeds        
 golden orfe.They start to sell the    
 fish in spring and finish at the      
 end of April.The fish spawn in June   
 and July.                             </content>
