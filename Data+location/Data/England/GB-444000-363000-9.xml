		<content>{ Hardwick Hall}is obviously the major 
 place of interest (see{page 6).}Also  
 within the area, at{Stainsby,}there   
 is the site of an old{moated manor.}An
 old{schoolhouse}now stands on the site
 and is now used as a short-stay       
 residence for pupils at a Bradford    
 school. There is also a non-working   
{mill}at Stainsby which is a recently  
 restored{listed building.             
  In the area close to Hardwick Hall is
 a{medieval wood,}still untouched and a
 source of great interest and          
 information for visiting students.    
  To the east of Hardwick Hall is the  
{keeper's cottage}referred to in{"Lady 
{Chatterley's Lover"}by{D.H.Lawrence.  
 Nearby Norwood Lodge,1739,is being    
 restored. Ault Hucknall church is     
 noteworthy, particularly for its      
 annual well-dressing-flower pictures.
