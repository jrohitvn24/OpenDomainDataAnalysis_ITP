		<content> First I went down to see 53.When I got
there she'd had 11 piglets.I was so ex-
cited I ran over to school &amp; told Mrs  
Pearson, my teacher.Then we had a game 
of football.We went back into class &amp;  
got our Domesday Project Map out.We    
were going to Blackthorn with MissHadd-
lesey's class in the school minibus.We 
had to mark down all the houses,garages
&amp; other things.When we got back we     
wrote up our work until 3pm.When I got 
home I said Hello to my dad(my mum goes
out to work from 10am to 5pm), then I  
went to the barn &amp; got Flash's food    
ready.I ran to the gate, opened it &amp;   
rattled the bucket.He ran to me.I said 
Hello, took him down to the yard &amp; put 
him in his pen, then I went to see 53. 
In the end she had 14 piglets.I got in 
with them &amp; counted them.There were    
only 12.I looked in the straw. Two were
born dead. (CONTINUED PAGE 17).        </content>
