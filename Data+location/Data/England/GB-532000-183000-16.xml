except this one has a space ship.      
   A main road splits the park in two. 
In one half there are football pitches 
and a cricket pitch.There is an open   
air swimming pool used in the summer   
and a running track complete with      
hurdles, plus an old adventure play-   
ground. About two monthe ago they made 
a modern adventure with a death slide  
which is a long rope from high up,and  
you slide down on a rope. In the park  
is a band stand that nobody uses and a 
bowling ground. Victoria park is really
known as Vicky park and is very well   
used by the local people especially in 
fine weather.It is really good to have 
a big area of open space in such a     
heavily built up part of London.
