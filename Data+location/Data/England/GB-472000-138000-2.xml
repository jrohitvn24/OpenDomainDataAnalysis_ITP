		<content>   {Holybourne}is a very old and       
 picturesque village that lies about   
 two miles from{Alton}in Hampshire. The
 name Holybourne is believed to derive 
 from the Celtic practice of worship,  
 and their dead being buried by the    
 side of a stream.                     
                                       
    The stream called the 'Holybourne' 
 which runs to the{River Wey,}arises as
 springs in the pond next to the       
{village church.                       
                                       
   {The Romans}rested in Holybourne    
 when they were on their way to London.
 A lot of Roman pots and coins have    
 been found in the Holybourne area, and
 on{Holybourne Down} and at{Neatham.}  
                                       
    The village developed during {The  
{Middle Ages,}and many old and         
 beaitiful buildings still stand today.</content>
