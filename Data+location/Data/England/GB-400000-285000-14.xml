		<content>  On{Harborne Rd}there is a{water tower
 and a{reservoir.}The reservoir        
 supplies{50,000 people in B'ham}with  
 drinking water. It belongs to the     
 Severn-Trent Water Authority. The     
 water tower however belongs to the    
 S.Staffordshire Water Co. It is used  
 as a backup if water in S.Staffs, or  
 in emergency B'ham,runs low.          
  The reservoir needs to hold a lot of 
 water if it is to supply 50,000 people
 with water a day,{1.25 million gallons
 in fact. This large amount of water is
 needed because{each person uses 24    
{gallons a day.}That is used mainly in 
 W.C. flushing, laundering, drinking,  
 cooking, cleaning and other domestic  
 activities.
