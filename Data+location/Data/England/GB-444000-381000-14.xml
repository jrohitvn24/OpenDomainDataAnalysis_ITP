		<title>14BROWNIES AND CUBS IN WALES</title>
		<content>{BROWNIES}- Brownies are group of girls
 who meet weekly. On the first night   
 the leader will put you in a          
 particular 'six' or group. Our six    
 names are Gnomes, Imps, Elves, Pixies,
 and Sprites. We play games and do     
 handicrafts and bookwork. The brownie 
 uniform is a brown dress and a yellow 
 tie. You can start brownies at seven  
 years of age and you leave at ten,    
 when you can join the guides if you   
 wish.                                 
{CUBS}- Cubs are a group of boys who   
 meet weekly at the scout hut.You start
 cubs at the age of eight and leave at 
 ten and a half.The cub uniform is a   
 green jumper and grey shorts with a   
 red and green neckachief.The cub      
 motto is "Be prepared". Like in the   
 Brownies, Cubs do tasks so as to      
 achieve different badges which are    
 sewn onto their uniforms.             </content>
