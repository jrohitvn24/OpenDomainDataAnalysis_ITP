      {Holy Family Primary School}is on
 a large council estate to the south of
 Rochdale centre. It has a staff of    
 five full-time and one part-time      
 teacher, with the assistance of a     
 qualified nursery nurse, to deal with 
 over 100 children between the ages of 
 four and ten.                         
                                       
      There are close links with the   
 parish church, this being a Roman     
 Catholic school, and the Parish Priest
 is a frequent visitor.                
                                       
      The school is built on the side  
 of a hill, which has certain scenic   
 advantages and other more practical   
 disadvantages: in effect it is on     
 three distinct levels which makes the 
 movement of heavy equipment rather    
 problematical.                        </content>
