		<title>16CHURCH GARDEN FETE</title>
		<content> Rector Edward  Boteler, royalist  high
 churchman,in 1650 antagonised his par-
 ishioners by altering the register en-
 tries of Quaker births and burials. So
 was born the strong 'chapel' tradition
 still with us to-day.  The magnificent
 old  church  has  few  supporters  but
 heavy  commitments. The  annual church
 garden party is the major event of the
 village.Church supporters man the att-
 ractions,all the village rallies round
 and  funds  are  raised.  Cake,  white
 elephant, tombola and plant stalls vie
 with games of skittles and clock golf,
 while a fortune teller reassures every
 one of the future. A local  band plays
 for those  who  have  spent  up  while
 waiting for  the Grand Draw to be dec-
 ided.There are compeititoins for child
 ren and general approval of the after-
 noon's success while deciding that  we
 really must do better next year.      </content>
