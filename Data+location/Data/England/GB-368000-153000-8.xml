		<content> 1985 saw the 300th anniversary of the 
 Monmouth Rebellion. Schools throughout
 the west renacted the march.          
   Some children from our school       
 marched from Norton St Philip to Frome
 dressed in period costume.            
   All the school did work on it. One  
 class made several visits to Norton St
 Philip to do work about the skirmish  
 (battle) there.                       
   Mr Bates the Headmaster told us     
 about it and showed slides to us in   
 assembly. The 1st year classes were   
 studying housing and families in      
 stuart times. Two classes were doing  
 about the march plus the transport in 
 the  period. Another class did the    
 story of the battle for the throne.   
   We enjoyed this project about       
 Monmouth because it was so local. The 
 9 mile march was brilliant (and       
 tiring!)                              </content>
