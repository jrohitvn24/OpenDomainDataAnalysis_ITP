 "We went to the Telephone Exchange. It
 is a new computerised exchange. They  
 have a new dialling tone. When        
 somebody rings up the computer looks  
 for a spare line, then it connects    
 them to the other people. The new     
 computerised exchange is a lot        
 quieter. I like the old dialling tone 
 best."                                
                                       
 "The new telephone exchange is        
 computerised and is not as noisy as   
 the old one. There is more room in the
 new one. The old one breaks down more 
 easily because the things downstairs  
 move around and things move up and    
 down. Parts that move alot break down 
 more easily." {
