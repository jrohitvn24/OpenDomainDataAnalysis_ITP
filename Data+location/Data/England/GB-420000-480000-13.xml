		<title>13A DAY IN THE LIFE OF PIPPA</title>
		<content>    I am a girl of eleven years old. I 
 live in Masham. My name is Pippa      
 Bramley. I have light brown hair. I   
 have two sisters and one brother. I   
 get up every morning at 8.00.a.m.and  
 set off for school at about 8.45.a.m. 
 The bell for us to line up in the     
 playground goes at 9.00.a.m.          
    A teacher comes to send us in. Mr. 
 Morgan calls the register to see if we
 are all here. Now we go into hymn     
 practise with Miss Hird and all have a
 good sing.                            
    After hymn practise we do our maths
 and topic work until 12.00.p.m. After 
 dinner I go into the library until    
 1.15.p.m. After afternoon register we 
 do science or language. Now we have a 
 playtime.Once play has finished we    
 listen to a story until 3.30.p.m.     
 Sometimes there is a club to go to    
 after school like Chess Club.         </content>
