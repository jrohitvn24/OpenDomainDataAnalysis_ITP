		<title>02The People of Droylsden</title>
		<content> The Droylsden people are very friendly
 and sociable. The people walk on the  
 streets without any shame. Some of the
 older people would rather live in the 
 past. Droylsden is a residential area 
 with semi-detached and terraced       
 houses. Apart from one factory and two
 schools there are open spaces with    
 fields, trees and parkland. There is  
 also a canal running all the way into 
 Manchester.All of the people are on   
 the same level and nothing in the park
 is too scruffy to play on. The people 
 in the shops are friendly and pleased 
 to serve you. There is little         
 vandalism. The people seem happy with 
 their town, they always say how nice  
 the town of Droylsden is. Old people's
 homes share a part of the area as     
 well. Youth clubs keep the youths away
 from trouble.
