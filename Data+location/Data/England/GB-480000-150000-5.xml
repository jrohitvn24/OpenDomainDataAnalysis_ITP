		<content>     We are not near the sea so our    
 temperatures can be rather extreme    
 in comparison with coastal areas.     
     We have  been keeping a record of 
 the weather in Church Crookham for the
 month of{JUNE.                        
     Our findings are:-                
 Days of rainfall more than 2mm ={11.} 
 Average Temperature ={14. 94 }        
 Prevailing wind ={s.w.                
     This was a very cold and wet      
 June, but not the very wettest.       
{   }We found out from{Mr Ulyat}of the 
 Farnborough meteorologicial Office    
 that the  lowest June temperature     
 was 6.9 C.in 1918, and the most rain  
 in one day fell in June 1971, when    
 there was 47.6mm. Usually there are   
 6.6 daily hours of sunshine, making   
 June normally the sunniest month.     
 Annual rain (average for S.E.England) 
 700 mm.                               </content>
