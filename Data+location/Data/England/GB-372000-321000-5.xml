		<content> BECAUSE THE NEEDLES OF CONIFEROUS     
 TREES DO NOT BREAK DOWN CAUSING THE   
 SOILS TO BE ACIDIC. THE ONLY PLANTS WE
 FOUND GROWING IN THESE SOILS WERE     
 FERNS AND A FEW BRAMBLES. THERE WERE  
 PINE NEEDLES AND CONES COVERING THE   
 FLOOR AND AMONG THIS LITTER WERE      
 INSECT LARVAE. WE ALSO SAW SOME GREY  
 SQUIRRELS AND RABBITS.                
   THE AIMS OF OUR HEDGEROW SURVEY WERE
 TO FIND OUT WHETHER HEDGEROWS STILL   
 EXISTEDEITHER SIDE OF THE ROADS AND TO
 SURVEY THE PLANT AND ANIMAL LIFE IN   
 SAMPLE SECTIONS OF HEDGEROW.          
   THE ONLY MAIN ROADS IN OUR AREA WERE
 THE A41(T) AND THE NEWPORT BY-PASS    
 WHICH IS NOT MARKED ON THE MAP AS IT  
 WAS COMPLETED IN OCTOBER              
 1984. HEDGEROWS ALONG THESE TWO MAJOR 
 ROADS ARE NOT COMMON. ON THE BY-PASS  
 WE SAW WIRE AND RANCH FENCING. ON THE 
 A41(T) THERE ARE MAINLY SANDSTONE     </content>
