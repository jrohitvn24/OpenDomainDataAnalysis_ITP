		<content> Chiddingly and Golden Cross are       
multi-faith areas. The people follow   
different religions but  the most      
common ones are the Church of England  
and Roman Catholic. There are also a   
few Non-conformists and Baptists.      
There is a Parish church at both Upper 
Dicker and Chiddingly which are both   
Church of England. These are the most  
local as Golden Cross does not have    
it's own church.                       
 Chiddingly church was built about 700 
years ago. It has a tower and a spire  
which was built in the 15th century.   
The spire was built from local stones. 
The church is now in the process of    
restoration.                           
 The Upper Dicker church is used       
extensively by St.Bede's School and is 
twinned with Hellingly Parish church.
