 On Wye Downs all the flowers grow     
 wild.They are mostly poppies.But when 
 the bombs fell and ruined the wheat   
 the poppies came up.So thats why we   
 buy poppies for rememberance day.The  
 orchid is purple and the roots has two
 small roots with thin and long roots  
 coming out.Daisy were scattered over  
 the Wye downs.Their petals are white  
 and small.We found some vetch we      
 thought it was Horse-shoe vetch, which
 is yellow and has separate petals. Wye
 Downs are a conservation area and     
 no one is allowed to pick flowers     
 there. the Downs are quite high and   
 you can see them from all over our    
 area.
