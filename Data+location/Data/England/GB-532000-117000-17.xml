		<title>17Inholmes Orchard, Bur. Hill</title>
		<content> This is a new estate in  North East   
 Burgess Hill. The estate used to be an
 orchard owned by Inholmes farm and is 
 still shown as such on the Ordnance   
 Survey map. The estate was started in 
 1983 and should be finished by 1986.  
 The building is progressing quickly.  
 This estate contains flats as well as 
 houses. There is no special reason for
 this except that they wanted to have  
 different people mixed together. A    
 typical flat costs Â£36,500. They all  
 have garages just at the left hand    
 side. There are two-and three-bedroom 
 flats. The author lives in a four     
 bedroom house with two toilets,       
 bathroom and shower room. It also has 
 a dining room, lounge and kitchen.    
 There is also a massive back garden   
 but a small one at the front.
