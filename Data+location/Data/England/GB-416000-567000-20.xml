		<title>20St. John's Church Fete.</title>
		<content>   The fete took place on July 13th in 
 St John's grounds and in the Church   
 Hall.                                 
  There was a variety of stalls such as
 the tombola, a wheel of fortune, and  
 one with homemade cakes and other     
 items of food. There was a white      
 elephant stall selling second-hand    
 clothes, shoes and toys.              
   A lot of items were handmade such as
 woollen dolls, jumpers, babies hats   
 and mittens. The money from all except
 one stall was to pay for central      
 heating inside of the church. The     
 stall that wasn't raising money for   
 the church was selling brass and      
 handmade wooden ornaments which Indian
 orphans had made to sell.             
   It was a busy and friendly fete.    
 Even though it was raining, a lot     
 of people came,and at the end of the  
 fete they had raised Â£300.            </content>
