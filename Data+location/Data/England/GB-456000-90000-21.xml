<title>21Havenstreet Railway - 25 years on</title>
<content>

25 years on and now in 2011 the "Havenstreet Steam Railway" has grown to become one of the Isle of Wight's most important and leading tourist attractions, with well over 100,000 people taking a ride on its steam trains every year.&lt;br />&lt;br />The railway is also registered as a "not for profit" educational charity, and is regularly visited by school parties for a "living history" experience. It has also won several major awards.&lt;br />&lt;br />In 1986 the railway was just 1.75 miles long, but in 1991 volunteers extended the track to Smallbrook Junction so now it is nearly 5 miles long. The railway now has 1,400 members, and is operated mainly by approximately 250 volunteers plus 20 paid staff. &lt;br />&lt;br />The Havenstreet Steam Railway was first established at Havenstreet in 1971, so this year (2011) is its 40th anniversary and several special events have been held to mark that achievement.&lt;br />&lt;br />The work to restore the railway's important collection of historic locomotives, carriages and wagons is a never ending task, whilst the visitors facilities such as the Refreshment Rooms, museum and shop, have all been recently refurbished and improved.   &lt;br />
