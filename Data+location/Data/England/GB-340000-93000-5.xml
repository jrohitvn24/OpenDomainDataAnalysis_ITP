 Northern side of the A.35 road.       
    The building is Victorian and      
 provides food as well as beers and    
 spirits together with Bed and         
 Breakfast facilities. There is parking
 for about a dozen cars.               
    Some 600 metres along the A.35 in  
 an Easterly direction and on the North

 Sun which was once an Inn which now   
 serves coffee, lunches and dinners.   
 There is parking for 6 or 7 cars.     
    Several of the bungalows and       
 cottages on this section of the A.35  
 offer Bed and Breakfast accomodation  
 for travellers and tourists passing   
 along the road.
