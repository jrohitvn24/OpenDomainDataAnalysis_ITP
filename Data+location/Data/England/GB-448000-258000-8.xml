		<title>08The skies above our heads(1)</title>
		<content>The skies above our block are busy with
aircraft,both night and day.Military   
air traffic is very common.It flies    
most commonly at altitudes of between  
250 and 500feet.It is using our block  
as a transit zone between the aircraft 
avoidance areas which surround London  
and Birmingham.These military planes   
have been using the ranges and bombing 
runs off S.Wales.When they pass over us
they're routing back to bases in East  
Anglia,Lincolnshire or West Germany.   
These are the most common military     
planes:Harrier and Tornado(R.A.F.)     
A 10 Tankbusters (U.S.A.F.)            
Phantoms(either),and Hercules.         
We were surpised to discover that none 
of the planes over our block was from  
the nuclear strike base at Upper       
Heyford.
