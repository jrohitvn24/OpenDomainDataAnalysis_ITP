		<title>08NEWDIGATE RIGHTS OF WAY</title>
		<content> There are approximately twelve defined
 Rights of Way in the specified grids  
 and many other footpaths.These        
 generally connect places of           
 importance,i.e.Farms,Church,School and
 Public Houses.They have all been      
 walked recently and most stiles and   
 footbridges are in good condition.    
   Nowadays footpaths are mainly walked
 for pleasure by local people and      
 rambling groups.The paths are the     
 responsibility of the local landowner 
 but help with maintenance can be      
 obtained from the local authority.All 
 paths are marked with a finger post   
 where they meet the highway and many  
 are marked with yellow waymarks for   
 footpaths or blue waymarks for        
 bridleways.Most paths have been in    
 existance for hundreds of years and   
 their route cannot be altered except  
 by an order from the local authority. </content>
