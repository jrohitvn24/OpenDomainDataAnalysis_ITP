		<content>  In the area around our school,Higher 
 Openshaw,Manchester,there are mostly  
 terraced houses and open,landscaped,  
 grass spaces.There used to be houses  
 on the spaces but they got knocked    
 down because they were not fit to live
 in.By the side of our school there is 
 an electric railway line which runs   
 from Manchester to Glossop.At the back
 of our school there is a branch of the
 Stockport and Ashton Canal which has  
 been filled in and made into a        
 footpath.There are some factories     
 around our school.One factory called  
 Laurence Scotts,which made steel,was  
 closed down and the people lost their 
 jobs.The Smithfield Market,which is a 
 large wholesale fruit and vegetable   
 market,is also at the back of our     
 school.Next door to our school is the 
 High Bank Industrial Estate which has 
 all different kinds of businesses.    </content>
