    The church of{St. Denys}in Severn  
 Stoke (C of E) was built by the Saxons
 and lies in the diocese of Kempsey.In 
 1886 the river Severn rose three feet 
 into the church making this one of    
 only two churches in the U.K. which   
 has been subject to flooding.The vicar
 of Severn Stoke lives in Kempsey and  
 is responsible for two other parishes 
 as well.The congregation numbers fifty
 to one hundred people, with services  
 held regularly on Sundays and         
 occasionally on weekdays.             
    The{Hare Krshna}movement owned the 
 Croombe Court Estate for a time and   
 worked the estate's land as a         
 co-operative farm.However, they kept  
 themselves very much to themselves and
 did not have much influence on the    
 surrounding villages.                 </content>
