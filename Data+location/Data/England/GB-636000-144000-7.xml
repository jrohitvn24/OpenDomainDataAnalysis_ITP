		<content>   Our day starts at 8.55am when the   
 whistle is blown for us to line up in 
 the playground.After registration we  
 all go into the hall for morning      
 assembly.Mornings are usually language
 work and Mathematics.Mid morning break
 is at 10.30am and lunch is at 12.00am.
                                       
   We have a very fine cook and all the
 dinners are cooked on the premises.   
 After dinner we are looked after by   
 Mrs Joyner,Mrs Wainwright and Mrs     
 Dolbear-the dinner ladies. We play out
 on the playgrounds and when its fine  
 on the playing fields which are at the
 side of the school.                   
                                       
   My overall impression of my school  
 is a good one. Here I think we are    
 happy and well taught.
