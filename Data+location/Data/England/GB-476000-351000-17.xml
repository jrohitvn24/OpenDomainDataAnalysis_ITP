		<title>17The A46 Bypass around Newark</title>
		<content> The public inquiry into the proposed  
 bypass mentions the possibility of    
 flooding in parts of Farndon and East 
 Stoke. If they go ahead they will     
 knock down 34, Castle Gate,           
 Ferryman's House, Newark cricket club 
 ground and the dairy. All these       
 properties have flooded before but now
 it will be worse and others say it    
 will be too noisy. The Dept of        
 Transport say thwy will build a flood 
 bank to protect 28 houses on Kelham   
 Road. People are divided. Some think  
 that the bypass will be a good thing  
 because there is so much traffic going
 through Newark. Others think that     
 because of the problem of increased   
 flooding, this is not the right plan.
