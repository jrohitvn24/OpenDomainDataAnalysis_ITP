		<content> The area is cut through by the        
 Wayfarers Walk much used by ramblers  
 as are many other cross country       
 footpaths.There are also many bridle  
 paths well used by individual riders  
 and riding schools.                   
 The Hambledon and Hursley Hunt meet   
 regularly in the area.                
 Pheasants are bred on several farms   
 and much shooting is done for         
 pleasure.                             
 3 or 4 holes of the Corhampton Golf   
 Course lie in the south east corner of
 the area.                             
 Racehorse gallops are ridden across   
 Stephen Castle Down.
