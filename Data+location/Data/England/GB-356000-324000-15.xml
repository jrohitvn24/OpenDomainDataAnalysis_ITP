 The literal meaning of Stanton derives
 from the latin word which means stoney
 estate.  The village is very old and  
 boasts the remains of a Roman fort,   
 although there is some disagreement as
 to where it is exactly situated.  It  
 was thought to have been used as a    
 staging post for provisioning the     
 soldiers and watering the horses of   
 the Roman Legion.  The well known     
 Shropshire authoress Mary Webb once   
 lived in the local manor house at     
 Harcourt which was then known as The  
 Woodlands.  It is thought that parts  
 of the locality were used in one of   
 her books although the setting of the 
 book is America.  There is a fairly   
 ancient building very small, which    
 used to be used as a prison.  A small 
 stone bridge across the River Roden   
 bears the date 1791.                  </content>
