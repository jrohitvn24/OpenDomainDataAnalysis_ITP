		<title>20LOCAL INDUSTRY AND CRAFTS</title>
		<content>  There   is   one   main   source   of
 employment    in    this   area  of   
 Bedfordshire and that is the Cranfield
 Institute  of  Technology.  Farming is
 also a  major  industry  but  actually
 employs far fewer people especially as
 cereal   growing   predominates.   Of 
 smaller   industries   there  is  the 
 electronics firm  Dagnall  Electronics
 which like all the local businesses is
 a "family" concern.                   
  There is  much  interest  in  country
 crafts and  perhaps the most famous is
 that  of   Cranfield  lacemaking  -  a
 thriving craft  kept  alive  by  local
 interest.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
