		<title>09VALE PARK - NEW BRIGHTON</title>
		<content> We would like to tell you about New   
 Brighton's Vale Park. Vale Park is    
 quite a big public park with swings,  
 slides, trees, rose gardens and a     
 bandstand. There are four entrances to
 Vale Park and one leads you onto the  
 promenade.                            
 The bandstand is very interesting     
 because people perform shows there.   
 One of these is called {JOYTIME},and  
 is a competition for young children.  
 The finals of this competition are    
 held at the Floral Pavilion which is a
 big theatre on New Brighton front.    
 Another event that takes place at the 
 bandstand is {FOLK IN THE PARK}where  
 folk groups come and sing on Sunday   
 afternoons. People walking around the 
 park can buy refreshments at a small  
 shop and the can sit on the hills and 
 watch the river.{
