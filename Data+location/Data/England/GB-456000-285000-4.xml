		<content>   Watching television was the         
 overwhelmingly favourite pastime of 11
 year olds,the favourite programme     
 being "The Young Ones",a rather       
 off-beat,slightly vulgar,comedy       
 show.Reading was also a popular       
 activity,fiction being preferred to   
 non-fiction,and animal stories being  
 the favourite.Several boys liked      
 playing games on their computer and   
 several girls liked listening to pop  
 records.Tennis was the most popular   
 outdoor activity and a lot liked      
 playing it,but very few said they did 
 anything else outside,despite the fact
 that there is a cricket pitch and a   
 recreation ground in 2 of the         
 villages.There was also a marked lack 
 of participation in organisations like
 brownies and cubs,even though there is
 a cub pack in Gilmorton.
