		<content> Sir John Moore Barracks is a Light    
 Division Training Depot. 234          
 sixteen-year old boys come here for   
 one year to learn to be soldiers.     
 After their training they go on to    
 join a Battalion.                     
 The boy soldiers learn how to use     
 weapons and how to read maps.They have
 P.E.,Sports and Drill. They also learn
 First Aid and signalling.             
 The eagle which now stands at the     
 entrance to Sir John Moore Barracks   
 was taken from Minden Barracks,       
 Cologne, Germany, while the King's    
 Shropshire Light Infantry were there  
 as part of the British Army of the    
 Rhine in 1925.                        
 Sir John Moore Barracks has been the  
 'home' of the Light Infantry since    
 1881. It will not be used to train boy
 soldiers after 1986.
