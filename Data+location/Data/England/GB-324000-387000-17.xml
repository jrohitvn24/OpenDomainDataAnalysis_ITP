		<content> The health care in our D block is     
 reasonable. On Greasby Rd there is a  
 health centre; inside the health      
 centre there are three doctors, two   
 men and one woman,there are two       
 waiting rooms where you wait for the  
 doctors to finish with their patients 
 that were before you,the doctors then 
 give you a prescription for you to    
 take to the chemist across the road.  
 They give you a bottle of medicine or 
 pills, cream or anything that is      
 written on the prescription.If        
 problems arise wit your teeth there   
 are two dentists over the Spar shop   
 and some dentists in the health       
 centre,the dentists can fill in your  
 teeth if you have got a hole in it and
 it is causing great pain they sit you 
 in a chair which can move up or down. 
 This gets the dentist into a better   
 position to fix your teeth.....       </content>
