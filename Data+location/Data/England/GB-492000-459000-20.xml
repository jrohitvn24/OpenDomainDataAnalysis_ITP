		<content> In Wetwang there is not very much     
 traffic but on the Main Street there  
 is quite alot.There are usually quite 
 alot of heavy lorries going through   
 Main Street during the day and there  
 are alot of cars too.                 
      We have a few fast drivers in    
 Wetwang and we have motorbikes as well
 but not many.Lots of people ride bikes
 round Wetwang and some ride them to   
 work.                                 
      We get quite alot of tractors    
 (and in harvest quite a few combines) 
 because we have alot of farms around  
 Wetwang.                              
      There is only one bus service and
 that goes to Driffield.It only goes   
 once a day and if you miss it that's  
 it.You really need a car if you live  
 here and if you haven't got one       
 you're stuck!
