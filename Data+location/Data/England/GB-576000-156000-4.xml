		<title>04MAIDSTONE PRISON</title>
		<content>Maidstone prison was built on its      
present site in 1811-18. The architect 
was Daniel Alexander. The prison is    
surrounded by a ragstone wall on three 
sides (probably from the Boughton      
Quarries) and on the fourth side by the
County Hall, which was originally built
as a Sessions house in 1828.  The      
prison was built as a County Jail and  
House of Correction, costing #22,000.  
Prisoners were transported overseas    
through tunnels via the River Medway.  
The modern prison of 13 acres is an    
adult male long-term training prison   
for category "B" prisoners. It provides
vocational training programmes (welding
bricklaying, printing, tailoring etc..)
Education is given from general        
education up to Open University level. 
Inmate links with the town include a   
Braille unit and work with older folk, 
children and Cheshire Homes.           </content>
