		<title>06FARMING IN BOURNE END</title>
		<content>There are three farms,Pigeon House Farm
(300 acres),Hollands Farm (230 acres)  
and Well End Farm (114 acres).Pigeon   
House is an arable farm,growing mainly 
corn crops,and exchanging crops with   
the local market garden.Hollands Farm  
has dairy cattle, the herd being       
changed from Guernsey to Friesian.Well 
End Farm has calves,being self-        
contained like Hollands Farm, growing  
its own grass for silage and  hay and  
turnips for the cattle. The Lunnon     
family have owned Hollands Farm for    
many generations,(a book has been      
published about them).Well End Farm is 
the older of the two smaller farms,    
being built in the sixteenth century.  
The Lunnon family have been working    
there since 1750.A yew tree            
mentioned in the original Domesday     
Book,is said to be still standing in   
the farm today.                        </content>
