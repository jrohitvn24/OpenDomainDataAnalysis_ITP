		<content> I think of Castleford as a small      
 mining town in West Yorkshire but deep
 in my heart I think of it as the      
 biggest place in the world.Castleford 
 has lots of factories.Many of them are
 very important like Mackintosh's and  
 Hickson &amp; Welsh but all these         
 factories make the atmosphere in      
 places rather polluted.In fact in some
 places you would get the idea that    
 Castleford is rather a dull place.It  
 has its own rugby team which you may  
 have heard of.It has a very high range
 of leisure for a small town with night
 clubs,video shops and a very wide     
 range of sports. Castleford is also   
 the place where the River Calder and  
 the River Aire meet.It also has a     
 little bit of history to it.It was    
 one of the main Roman strongholds.Also
 Henry Moore,a famous sculptor and     
 artist,was born and raised here.      </content>
