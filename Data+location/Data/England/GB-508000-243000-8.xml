		<content> An independent meeting was held in    
 Cotton End from the seventeenth       
 century but the first meeting house   
 was constructed on the present site in
 1777.  Todays building dates from     
 1836/7.  Cotton End has been a centre 
 of nonconformity from the seventeenth 
 century and a notable academy for the 
 training of congregational ministers  
 and missionaries was based here in the
 nineteenth century.  Services today   
 are well attended with approximately  
 35 to 40 adults and 20 children       
 congregating on a Sunday.  The two    
 Sunday services are held at 11 a.m.   
 and 6 p.m. with a Sunday School for   
 the children in the morning and a     
 Bible Study and Prayer meeting on     
 Tuesdays.
