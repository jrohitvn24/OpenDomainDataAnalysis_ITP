		<content> Most people live in semi-detached     
 houses ,but some people live in       
 detached or bungalows. The approximate
 number of windows in a semi-detached  
 is 9 to 10 and in a bungalow there are
 approxamately 12 to 14 windows. There 
 are usually 2 external doors on each  
 house the front and the back. Most    
 houses have a garage. We did a survey 
 of children that share a bedroom with 
 brothers or sisters, the results were 
 7 do share a room and 17 do not share 
 a room, so most children in 1985 are  
 lucky enough to have their own room.  
 At the moment there is a modernisation
 programme in progress on the houses.  
 Most 11 year olds go to bed at        
 approximately 9o'clock to 11o'clock.  
 In the morning most children get up   
 between 7 and 8o'clock, eat breakfast 
 which consists of cereals and toast.  
 They then walk to school.             </content>
