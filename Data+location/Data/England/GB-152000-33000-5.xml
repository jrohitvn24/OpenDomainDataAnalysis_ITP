		<title>05Farming: Trewinnard Manor</title>
		<content>      In the parish of St.Erth in      
 Western Cornwall stands a fine old    
 mansion known as Trewinnard. This name
 which is purely Celtic signifies the  
 Town or Farm of the Thrush            
 (winnard).Trewinnard is sweetly placed
 upon a wooded slope which rises up    
 from the banks of the River  Hayle.   
      Parts of the present stately     
 mansion with its fine rooms, plaster  
 ceilings and old world garden date    
 back to Elizabethan times however the 
 main part of the house is Georgian.   
     Local records show that there was 
 a de Trewinnard as far back as        
 l3O2.The last local de Trewinnard     
 Rufus was dispossessed of the house   
 and the grounds in Elizabethan times  
 when he murdered a villager and was   
 condemmed to death, a sentence        
 commuted to loss of lands etc.
