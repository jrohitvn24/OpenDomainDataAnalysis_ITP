		<content> There are several organisations to    
 cater for various interests in the    
 village. The church has its choir and 
 bell ringers. A group of ladies meets 
 each Wednesday to do tapestries for   
 kneelers in the church. Another womens
 group meets on the first Wedneday     
 each month for a varied programme of  
 activities. There is also the Elm Club
 for older members of the community.   
 The youth is catered for at the weekly
 meeting of the Youth Club in the      
 village hall, and those who enjoy     
 drama may join the Theatre Club.      
 Gardeners have the meetins of the     
 Horticultural Society to look forward 
 to and the keen footballers can become
 members of Ewelme Football Team which 
 plays in an amateur league on Sundays.
