		<title>14Some school clubs.</title>
		<content> Church Hill Junior School, Thurmaston 
 has many clubs. This is what some     
 Third year children say about them:   
                                       
   We do{gardening}on Tuesday and Thurs
 day afternoons. A mother comes in to  
 help us. She has 4 children at a time.
 We planted crocus bulbs in the        
 greenhouse; weeded our school garden; 
 planted some seeds early in the cold- 
 frame and then planted flowers and    
 vegetables in the garden. We grew     
 beans, peas, lettuce, potatoes, cress,
 onions, carrots, petunias, candytuft  
 and geraniums.                        
   On Monday and Wednesday we have a { 
{recorder}group. I have a descant and  
 treble recoder. Some others play tenor
 recorder. There are beginners, middle 
 and top groups meeting in different   
 rooms.
