		<content>  My name is Sarah Pye,I live in       
 Summercourt and go to Ladock          
 School. I live with my dad,Grandma and
 my 2 sisters.                         
  On my sister,Karen's birthday,for a  
 birthday treat we were going ice      
 skating but she didn't know. When I   
 woke up,I ran to the lounge and put   
 her present on the T.V. I went into   
 the bathroom,had a wash and put on my 
 best jeans and a blue T-shirt. At     
 breakfast, which Grandma made, Dad    
 said "Lets go out," Nicola, my other  
 sister, took her roller skates,because
 she thought we were going roller      
 skating. When we got to the ice       
 skating rink we had great fun.        
  We got home at 6.30. We ate          
 tea and Karens birthday cake. I       
 watched T.V till 10.00 then we all    
 went to bed.                          
                                       </content>
