     On the farm there is a lot of work
to be done.                            
                                       
     I get up at 6.30a.m. to do the    
milking.  We have our breakfast. After 
breakfast I set in to do some more     
hard work.  I have to scrape the sheds 
out and then spread the muck. By that  
time it is dinner time.                
                                       
     Then I do some siloing which takes
the time up to about 5 o'clock and     
then I have to do the milking and then 
I suckle the calves.                   
                                       
     By this time it is 7 o'clock and I
have my tea and watch television and   
then I think, "Thank goodness for      
that" and I go to bed.
