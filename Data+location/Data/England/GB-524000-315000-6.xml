		<title>06TRAFFIC AROUND COWBIT</title>
		<content>      The traffic in Cowbit is very    
 mild especially on a Thursday because 
 it is half day closing in Spalding. On
 the main road through Cowbit there are
 more cars than lorries but in the     
 village there are more farm vehicles. 
      The bus service through the      
 village is very poor and the last bus 
 on a Saturday night is 19.22hrs. On a 
 Thursday there are more lorries going 
 towards Spalding than Peterborough. We
 think this is because the Spalding    
 shops are stocking up.                
      Each week day at 15.30hrs the    
 cars and push bikes increase with the 
 collection of children from school at 
 the end of the day.                   
      On the main road there is a speed
 limit of 40 mph even so some motorists
 ignore this and the safety of children
 riding on bikes.
