		<title>11Guisborough shops II</title>
		<content> Free refuse disposal was wanted by    
 most shop-keepers. At present a charge
 of 35p.a bag is made.What with the    
 high rates this was felt a disgrace.  
 Better street cleaning &amp; extra police 
 on the beat were also mentioned by    
 some.Most (14) felt a proposed by-pas 
 round the town would hurt their busin-
 ess,but 3 welcomed it.Asked to comment
 on the future, most felt it bleak.    
 'Multiples are taking over; small     
 shops have no chance. In Guisborough  
 the problem comes from Hintons, Fine  
 Fare, Boyes &amp; the Co-op',said one.    
 Guisb.has some specialist shops,e.g.  
 horse riding accessories; music shop. 
 There is a fast expanding book shop, a
 curtain boutique, delicatessen, shop  
 for bridal access,a gardening &amp;       
 petfood shop, plus the usual range.   
 The catchment area for shopers is     
 wide, extending far into E.Cleveland. </content>
