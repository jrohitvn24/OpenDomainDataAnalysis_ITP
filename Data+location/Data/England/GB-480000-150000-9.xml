		<content> In the southern and eastern part of   
 the study block lies a large area of  
 lowland heath.Much of this belongs to 
 the Ministry of Defence and is used   
 for troop training but it contains one
 Site of Special Scientific Interest   
 around the area of Ceasar's           
 Camp. Although there has been quite a 
 growth of invasive vegetation,such as 
 Silver Birch and Scots Pine,there are 
 still quite sizeable areas of open    
 heathland. The three main types of    
 heather;ling,bell and cross-leaved,   
 are in abundance and gorse is a very  
 common feature.Insects commonly       
 recorded range from dragonflies and   
 wolf and crab spiders to Emperor Moths
 and Silver Studded Blue Butterflies.  
 The rarer heathland birds,such as     
 Hobby,Dartford Warbler and Nightjar,  
 all nest in the area and adders and   
 common lizards are widespead.         </content>
