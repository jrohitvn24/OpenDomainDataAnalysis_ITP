		<title>11WATERMANS ARTS CENTRE</title>
		<content> Watermans Arts Centre, opened in 1984,
 was in planning for 15 years. It took 
 about three years to build and cost   
 about Â£2m. It is open every day, from 
 10am till 11pm.  About three thousand 
 people visit it each week. It includes
 a{theatre}and a{cinema.}Two popular   
 films recently shown were: Private    
 Function, for adults, and BMX Bandits,
 for children. There are regular{art   
{exhibitions,}a recent example being   
 Soviet War Artists.                   
                                       
 Lunches, teas and suppers are served  
 in the{restaurant}and there is a{bar. 
 The Centre is in{Brentford High Street
 on the north side of the Thames, just 
 west of{Kew Bridge.}There is, however,
 no danger of flooding, either of the  
 building or of the pleasant landscaped
 garden.
