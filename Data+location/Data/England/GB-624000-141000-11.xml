		<title>11ARABLE FARMING IN ALKHAM</title>
		<content> The lie of the land is a great        
 influence on land-use, the result     
 being that almost all the farms have  
 mixed agriculture. Flatter land is    
 most suited for the operation of      
 modern farm machinery and arable      
 farming is concentrated in these      
 areas.Hedges have been grubbed out to 
 make fields larger, some reaching 70  
 acres.Crops grown include wheat,      
 barley, rape, oats and field peas.    
 Wheat harvested in July is sold to    
 millers, barley planted in winter or  
 spring is sold for malting or animal  
 feed.Rape which gives such colour to  
 the valley in May is harvested in July
 and the seed sold to vegetable oil    
 producers and cattle feed             
 manufacturers.Most oats and peas are  
 used on the farm for cattle and sheep 
 feed during the winter months.
