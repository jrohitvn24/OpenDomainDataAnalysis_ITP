		<content>  Michelle:-                           
    My friends and I spend very little 
 of our spare time at home; after      
 school we have tea, do our homework,  
 perhaps watch television for half an  
 hour and then go out.  Once or twice a
 week, whenever we can afford it we go 
 to discos in Bradford  such as Dollars
 or Blue Lace, where we listen to the  
 music, chat and drink lager.  There   
 are always more boys than girls but   
 few people get up to dance until late 
 in the evening.                       
   When we don't go to discos we walk  
 around the estate with our friends or 
 go down to the Interchange in Bradford
 and hang about in groups.  We haven't 
 any hobbies but we all have weekend   
 jobs such as stacking shelves in the  
 supermarkets or helping to shampoo at 
 the local hairdressers.  Our parents  
 expect us to provide our pocket money.</content>
