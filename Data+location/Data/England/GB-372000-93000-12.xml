		<content>    We interviewed one member from each
 of two Puddletown families.The aim was
 to find out how local families spend  
 their time in the area{.              
{   Mrs.Mitchell}is our school         
 secretary. She has a husband (now     
 retired) and three daughters who have 
 left school in recent years.Up until  
 last summer she was busy taking her   
 daughters to athletics meetings around
 the country.She and her husband spend 
 much time in their garden.she use the 
 local shops and library regularly.    
 With her daughters now away from home 
 she has plans to move to a smaller    
 home in the near future.              
    As far as changes are concerned she
 would like to see more "starter homes"
 built,as well as a by-pass and more   
 light industry. she and her family    
 love Puddletown and would not like to 
 move away.                            </content>
