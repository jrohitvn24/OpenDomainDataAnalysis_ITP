		<content>    Residents within the village are   
 members of the{"Friends Of The        
{Quantocks". }This is a group dedicated
 to preserving the beauty of the hills 
 for future generations.               
    There is a{monitoring group   }    
 observing{quarrying at Triscombe}where
 they are extracting{Hangman's Grit }  
 from the face of the hills. Its       
 purpose is to see that the extraction 
 does not exceed the tonnage granted in
 1947.                                 
    Heavy boulders are quarried for sea
 defences along our low-lying          
 coastline, and a hard wearing small   
 grit is in great demand for surfacing 
 roads. It is anticipated that if the  
{Hinkley Point 'C' Nuclear Power       
{Station}is built, Hangman's Grit will 
 be used in the foundations.
