		<title>14TUNNEL CEMENT</title>
		<content>Tunnel Cement works dominates our view 
and employs 26 people from Cheddington.
From the outside it looks small,but    
once you are on the site it looks huge.
Inside Tunnel Cement there are two     
plants a wet plant and a dry plant.Mr  
J.Dymond showed us around,when we      
visited.First we went to the dry plant.
We walked underneath kiln 5 it was 500 
celcius  inside.As we walked by we saw 
a pile of something which we thought   
was solid,we stepped in it up to our   
shins.Next we looked at the chimneys,  
Mr. Dymond said that they were allowed 
one pinch of dust per cubic metre.Then 
we went to kiln 4,we were allowed to   
go up close and then we were allowed to
look inside,but first we put on some   
smoked glasses.Tunnel Cement produces  
tonnes of cement a week.
