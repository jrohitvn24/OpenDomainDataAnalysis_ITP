		<content> Calverhall is a small village in the  
 north of Shropshire close to the      
 borders of cheshire and staffordshire.
  the area is predomintely agricultural
 with littled evidence of new building 
 developments.  The agricultural units 
 are farms of medium size and there are
 large farmhouses or halls with more   
 modern agricultural buildings         
 attached.  The farms have amalgamated 
 over the years to that there are      
 isolated farmhoses now converted to   
 domestic dwellinghouses only the land 
 having been absorbed by other farms.  
 There are two lakes attached to two   
 country houses the lakes were once    
 ornamental but are now used for       
 recreational purposes.  The population
 live in either the more isolated      
 houses mentioned above or in the      
 village itself and work either in     
 agriculture or its associated services</content>
