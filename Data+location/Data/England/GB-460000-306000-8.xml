		<title>08AMIT'S DAY</title>
		<content> I woke up at 9.00 a.m. on Sunday and  
 went downstairs.Had a good stretch to 
 get rid of all the tiredness from my  
 body.After that I brushed my teeth and
 washed my face.Then we had some       
 breakfast (an Indian dish) it was     
 delicious apart from the hot          
 pepper.After eating I went to clean my
 brother's car;that took three hours.  
 For dinner we had chapatis,curry and  
 salad;for pudding we went to McDonalds
 for a milk shake.When we came home I  
 did some homework and then saw my     
 older brother off who lives in a flat 
 in London.My cousins arrived for tea  
 and games;we played "Monopoly" and I  
 won of course! When my cousins left I 
 nagged my dad to buy me the game      
 "Scrabble" and he agreed.After reading
 in bed I went fast asleep.            
                                       
                                       </content>
