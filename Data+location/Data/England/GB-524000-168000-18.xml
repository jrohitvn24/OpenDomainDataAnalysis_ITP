		<content> Now in 1985 ,the adult fare for a bus 
 ticket is 30p. and a child ticket is  
 15p.,but after 10:00 the child has to 
 pay the full fare of 30p.I think that 
 a child should only pay 10p. and      
 adults pay 20p. for a ticket.         
  In Mitcham there is a sports centre  
 called the Cannons.It has large       
 grounds and I think that makes it so  
 popular.You can play squash, go       
 swimming and go to judo in the        
 evenings, plus many other things.     
  There are many public parks and      
 commons in Mitcham, all with good     
 grounds.                              
  I think Mitcham is a good place to   
 live in.
