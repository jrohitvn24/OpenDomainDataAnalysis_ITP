   Although Croft and Dalton have no   
 shops, a selection of mobile shops    
 visits the villages regularly. A van  
 comes each weekday morning to sell    
 bread,cakes and sweets, while the well
 stocked greengrocer's van comes on    
 Tuesday lunchtimes.                   
   Once a fortnight, on Wednesdays, the
 Mobile County Library van is in the   
 villages, bringing a large selection  
 of books, whilst the Mobile Video Van 
 comes on Monday, Wednesday and Friday 
 evenings.                             
   The Croft Spa Hotel is very old, and
 was where people stayed when they were
 taking the spa waters. Now the hotel  
 has a hair-dressing salon and a sauna 
 and keep-fit gymnasium. The tennis    
 courts will soon be ready and plans   
 are going ahead to open a swimming    
 pool there.                           </content>
