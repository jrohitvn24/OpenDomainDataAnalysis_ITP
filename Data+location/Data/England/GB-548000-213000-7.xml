		<content> There are many different churches in  
 Sawbridgeworth of which the largest is
{St.Mary' s church}which stands in a   
 central position where four pathways  
 cross. They are used by people to get 
 from their homes to the shops.  It is 
 a typical Hertfordshire church built  
 of flint with a typical Hertfordshire 
 "spike" . It has quite a thriving     
 congregation with many activities     
 going on to keep them involved.       
 On the main London Road stands the    
{Congregational church.}It is a non    
 conformist church unlike St. Mary's   
 church which is a church of England.  
 It runs many activities especially for
 children.On Station Road there stands 
{Hillside chapel,}of no particular     
 denomination where services take place
 and a school meets on Sunday.In Bell  
 Street is a small Pentecostal Church  
 having regular Sunday services.       </content>
