		<title>16THE NEW PARK IN SINFIN.</title>
		<content> In the new park the council have built
 a gymnasium. It was built about a year
 and a half ago. It has 7 changing     
 rooms, toilets and one big room where 
 they put two tabletennis tables. My   
 dad works there on his own because he 
 is a park ranger. All week children go
 there to play tabletennis and at      
 weekends football teams go there to   
 play and use the changing rooms. There
 are 9 football pitches outside on the 
 park. The manager of the team has to  
 pay for the changing rooms and the    
 pitch. My dad works there all the time
 except when he has his days off, which
 are Tuesday and Wednesday. Apart from 
 that the tabletennis room is open for 
 the rest of the week. The tabletennis 
 room is open from 9.30 to 4.30.
