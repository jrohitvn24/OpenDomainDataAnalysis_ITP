		<title>11Being a Local Builder</title>
		<content>{James Wickam writes -}My Dad is a     
 local builder. He works on new houses 
 and bungalows, modern extensions and  
 he does renovations so he has to know 
 how to use many different materials.  
 Stone from three tumbled-down cottages
 was used to rebuild at Tucker's Farm, 
 Gatcombe. He uses bricks, slates and  
 tiles, stone slabs and cement blocks  
 as well as various types of soft and  
 hard woods. The materials have to suit
 the customer's requirements as well as
 meeting the Building Regulations.     
{                                      
{His tools include:                    
 Hammers, chisels, saws, shovel, string
 lines and a square, brickhod, pointing
 trowel, ladders and trestles as well  
 as a concrete mixer.                  
 In 1964 a bag of cement cost 7/- (35p)
 In 1985 a bag of cement costs Â£3.80   
     .........a rise of 1100%          </content>
