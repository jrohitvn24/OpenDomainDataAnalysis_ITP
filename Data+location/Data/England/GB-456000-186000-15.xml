		<title>15Power: Electricity/Gas</title>
		<content>{Electricity and gas} are the commonest
forms of power in homes and industries.
Electricity is produced in {power      
stations} where water is boiled to     
produce steam which is forced through  
turbines which rotate very quickly to  
allow electricity to be generated. The 
electricity is then conducted along    
overhead cables to homes and           
industries. Most {power staions} burn  
coal to boil the water, but oil and    
nuclear power are also used. Most of   
the gas that we use is {natural gas}   
from under the north sea. This is sent 
along underground pipes to homes and   
industries where it is used as a source
of heat for various jobs. Unlike       
electricity it is possible to store gas
in gasometers until it is required.    
Both gas and electricity pass through a
metering device which records how much 
has been used.                         </content>
