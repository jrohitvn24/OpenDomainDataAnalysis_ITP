		<title>08A VISIT TO THE LIBRARY</title>
		<content> When I have finished reading my       
 library books,I go to the library to  
 exchange them for up to six books of  
 my choice.In the entrance to the      
 library I give my books to a lady who 
 runs an electronic pen over an        
 attached code at the front of the     
 book.This shows if I have returned my 
 books late,in which case I have to pay
 10p per day per book.Having chosen my 
 books the lady at the exit will run a 
 pen over the attached code which will 
 record on a computer when the book was
 borrowed.                             
 Adults in some libraries can borrow   
 framed pictures,records or            
 audio-cassettes.Membership of the     
 library is free.You may use the       
 library to read a selection of        
 newspapers,magazines or to refer to   
 books for information.
