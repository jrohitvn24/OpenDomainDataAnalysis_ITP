		<content> They use the reservoir to irrigate the
 potatoes and sugarbeet.  They have 35 
 cattle but no bullocks and they have  
 quite a few heifers.  They have some  
 Jacob sheep and 22 lambs.             
    Mr. Marris sprays the crops to kill
 the weeds and insects which keeps them
 free of disease and which does not    
 harm the plants.  The machinery       
 consists of tractors, bailers, drills,
 irrigation machinery, trailers,       
 ploughs and a sub soiler.  The average
 area harvested in one day is 20 acres 
 and 1-1\ for sugarbeet.  There are    
 three men on the farm, his son another
 man and himself. The Marris have three
 pets a white pony called Tabboo, and a
 collie dog called Bess and a cat      
 called Wally.  The cattle are fed with
 crushed barley and whole potatoes.    
 The wheat goes to be made into bread.
