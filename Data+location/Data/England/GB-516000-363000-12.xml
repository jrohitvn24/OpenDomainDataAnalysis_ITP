		<title>12FARMING AROUND WOODHALL SPA</title>
		<content> Most of the land around Woodhall Spa  
 is very flat and low lying.The land is
 some of the best in England for       
 agriculture and there are a lot of    
 farms in the area.In the past the land
 was not very well drained and it got  
 very wet in poor weather.Farmers have 
 dug drainage dykes around the fields  
 to take away all of this water.Most of
 the farms grow crops such as grain and
 potatoes.Modern machinery such as     
 tractors and combine harvesters are   
 used nowadays and the flatness of the 
 land is perfect for this type of      
 farming.Few farms in the area have    
 many animals although there are some  
 herds of cattle.
