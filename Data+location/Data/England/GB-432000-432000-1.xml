		<title>01Introduction to the Area</title>
		<content>    The Area is made up of several very
 large council estates.   Many of the  
 houses are early 20th. Century terrace
 house with small gardens, extremely   
 large pavements and narrow roads.   A 
 great many of them are in a           
 delapidated condition and the living  
 standards of the inhabitants is poor, 
 with very few facilities and fewer    
 services. Unemployment and poverty are
 everpresent reminders of the ills of  
 society along with damaged properties,
 boarded up buildings and depressed    
 people.                               
    A pleasant aspect of the area is   
 the occurence of large parks and green
 areas.   These certainly break up the 
 drabness of the landscape and allow   
 the population open spaces to walk,   
 exercise and hld their sporing events.
