		<title>09 BACKWORTH COMMUNITY ROOM.</title>
		<content>The Community Room was set up in one   
of the mobile classrooms which became  
vacant when the extensions to the      
First School were completed.           
 The room is available to any local    
group.                                 
 At present the Community Room supports
a pre-school playgroup which was set up
and is run by parents. The parents of  
the nursery children use it occasionly 
to hold fund-raising events.           
 The local Health Authority hold       
monthly meetings for district nurses   
there.A fortnightly baby clinic is also
held there.
