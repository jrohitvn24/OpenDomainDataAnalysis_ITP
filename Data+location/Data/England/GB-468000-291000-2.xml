		<content> Fifty years ago food in shops was     
 very different than it is now.There   
 was no frozen food and no foreign     
 takeaways.Many people in the country  
 grew and reared their own produce.    
 Country schools were very small.Often 
 only one room with a screen down the  
 middle.They had children from 5 to 14 
 years old.Girls wore velvet tunics and
 hats and boys wore short trousers,    
 blazers and caps.They all wore black  
 lace up boots.In homes and schools    
 they did not usually have central     
 heating.The usual form of heating was 
 an open fire or a coke stove. If you  
 wanted water you had to fetch it from 
 a pump.They used to heat water in     
 kettles. Some toilets would flush but 
 you had to do this with a bucket of   
 water.
