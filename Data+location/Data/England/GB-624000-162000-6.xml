		<content> The{Higher Ground:}A few years ago    
 the animal and bird populations of the
 higher ground were numerous and varied
 . Dramatic{changes}have been brought  
 about by three new factors in farming:
 The grubbing out of the once extensive
 orchards. Disappearence of hedgerows  
 to make ever larger fields. The cyclic
 cultivation of cereals and green      
 vegetables. These factors make for    
{open environments}visited regularly   
 by man and machines. There are few    
{'sanctuaries'}left where creatures    
 can make homes or where food producing
 'weeds' can establish themselves. A   
 few creatures such as Hares and       
 Skylarks proliferate in their new     
 surroundings. Some such as Foxes and  
 the ubiquitous Hedgehog are tolerant  
 of it. Apart from these  and flocks of
 Seagulls,Crows,Woodpigeons,and        
 Lapwings,these are{desolate}places.   </content>
