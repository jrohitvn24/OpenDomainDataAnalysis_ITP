 The rainfall on Dartmoor is always    
 constant and the moor has for         
 centuries been looked on as a source  
 of water. The Devonport Leat,         
 completed in 1793 still supplies      
 Plymouth with water via Burrator      
 Reservoir.                            
                                       
{Peat}                                 
                                       
 Peat is occasionally dug by local     
 people for their own use as a source  
 of heat for fires, but is no longer   
 dug commercially.                     
                                       
{Granite}                              
                                       
 Granite has been extracted in small   
 quantities, but the remaining quarries
 have all now ceased to operate.       </content>
