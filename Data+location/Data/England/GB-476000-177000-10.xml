		<title>10SURVEY PHOTOGRAPHER,WARGRAVE</title>
		<content> When our class first knew about the{  
{Domesday Project,}I knew straight away
 that I wanted to be the{Photographer} 
 for this project because it is my     
 hobby.                                
                                       
 One Thursday, after school, about 5 of
 us went in the minibus from{Wargrave }
 to{Shiplake}to survey the village.    
 Before we set out we were all given a 
 map and put into pairs. Each pair took
 a different route through the area.   
 While my partner counted amenities, I 
 was looking for photos to take.       
                                       
 I tried to find subjects which in a   
 hundred years time will have gone out 
 of date, so people can look back and  
 say{"Oh, look at that old fashioned   
{object."}After I photographed the fire
 engine at Wargrave Festival I was     
 invited to visit the Fire Station.    </content>
