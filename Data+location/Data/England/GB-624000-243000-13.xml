		<title>13BRIGHTWELL PARISH CHURCH.</title>
		<content>{Brightwell} has a very small          
population. There is no village centre 
and the houses are scattered and       
sparse. They are mainly farms or       
farm-workers cottages. The parish      
church is in an isolated position near 
to the former Martlesham to Felixstowe 
road. This has become more isolated    
since the opening of the eastern       
section of the Ipswich Southern        
by-pass in 1984. Near to the church at 
one time stood a large house called    
"Brightwell". The Church is over 600   
years old and it was extensively       
restored in the 19th. Century.         
Services are held each Sunday Morning  
and during the week. There are about 20
regular worshippers.
