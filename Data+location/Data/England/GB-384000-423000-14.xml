		<content> The area has numerous old farmhouses  
 of which many had, with the change in 
 farming styles, fallen into disrepair.
 When the motorway(M66) opened to      
 Rawtenstall the area became more      
 accessible to Manchester. Property was
 cheap by comparison, but needed       
 bringing up to date.                  
   There are two groups of properties  
 being renovated a) terraced houses and
 b)detached farmhouses - these are     
 being updated at great cost to provide
 large comfortable houses for business 
 and professional people. Many of the  
 old characteristics, such as timber   
 beams and stone mullion windows are   
 being retained, the latter double     
 glazed. All receive central heating   
 and modern fittings and conveniences. 
 Woodburning stoves in some take       
 advantage of large, local timber      
 supplies.                             </content>
