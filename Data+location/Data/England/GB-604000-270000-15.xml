		<content>RAILWAY   A railway line runs through  
the area but there is no station. The  
nearest stations are at Diss (7 miles) 
and Stowmarket (9 miles). Trains go to 
Norwich or London.                     
BUSES   A bus goes to Eye and Diss     
every morning except Sunday, and to    
Stowmarket on Wednesdays and Saturdays 
and on school days during term time.   
Buses also go twice a week to Bury St. 
Edmunds. These services are better     
suited to shoppers than workers.       
POST BUS  A daily Post Bus transported 
passengers to and from Diss while      
delivering mail. This service lasted 10
years, touching several villages, but  
was withdrawn in June 1985 due to lack 
of support.
