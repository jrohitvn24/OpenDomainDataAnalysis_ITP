		<title>14GARAGES IN WELLS, NORFOLK</title>
		<content>                                       
   There are six garages in Wells      
including Roses, Popes, Barkers,       
Walsinghams, Orchard Caravan and       
Coronation Garages.  Although Wells is 
a small place there are quite a lot of 
garages.                               
   My Mum and Dad own Coronation Garage
where my Dad is the Chief Mechanic and 
my Mum does the paperwork, serves      
petrol and other odd jobs like that.   
They employ two men to work for them.  
   Coronation Garage is near the edge  
of town on the main coast road so we   
are quite busy as people coming in and 
out of Wells usually come to us.
