		<content> The{Rock Lodge Vineyard}has three and 
 a half acres.When they expand it will 
 have up to 7 acres.As birds are not   
 allowed to be shot in England nets are
 put over the vines.This takes a       
 week.They use grafted vines           
 because these are protected against   
 Floxora.It takes 3 years for a        
 seedling to produce a lot of fruit.The
 vineyard have won 2 silver awards and 
 one bronze from the English wine of   
 the year competition.There are now 250
 vineyards in England.The greatest     
 danger to a harvest is rabbits and at 
 the end,a wet month.The vines are     
 planted 5ft apart.When they collect in
 the grapes they hire 12 people to     
 gather them in.After this they measure
 how many tons of grapes they have.Then
 they are crushed and left for 30      
 minutes.All the sludge is liquidised  
 and put into a small container.       </content>
