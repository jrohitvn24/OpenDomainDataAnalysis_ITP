		<title>18The Bletchley/Aylesbury Road</title>
		<content> The Grand Union canal and the main    
 Bletchley/Leighton Buzzard/Aylesbury  
 road go through the west of our area. 
 The canal used to be busy but is now  
 only used by holiday boats in the     
 summer. I did a road survey for three 
 quarters of an hour during the        
 afternoon. In 3/4 hour I saw 103      
 cars going to Leighton Buzzard and    
 131 going to Bletchley, 2 buses and 1 
 coach went to Leighton Buzzard. 1 bus 
 went to Bletchley. There were 20 vans 
 going to Leighton Buzzard and 21 going
 to Bletchley. There were 21 lorries   
 going to Bletchley and 22 to Leighton 
 Buzzard. We saw no bikes going to     
 Leighton Buzzard, but 1 going towards 
 Bletchley. Also there was 1           
 transporter and 2 tractors,1 ambulance
 and 2 land rovers. Altogether most    
 traffic went to Bletchley at this time
 of day.                               </content>
