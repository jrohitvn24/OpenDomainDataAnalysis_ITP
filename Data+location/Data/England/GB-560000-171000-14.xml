		<content> A woman who claimed that her children 
 were starving abandoned 2 puppies near
 the famous site of the Swanscombe Man,
 because she said she could not afford 
 to keep them.An eminent geologist and 
 his American colleague took charge of 
 the dogs as the distressed mother     
 hurried off without giving her name.  
 The puppies will be destroyed in 7    
 days time unless somebody claims them.
 Northfleet Carnival was held on       
 Saturday and there were many          
 attractions including bands,majorettes
 and floats from local firms and       
 organisations.A new game called       
 Kabbadi is hoped to be introduced in  
 following years.A group of 27         
 employees of a Northfleet firm leapt  
 from the sky to raise money for a     
 local charity.Only 2 of them have     
 parachuted before and 5 had never     
 flown before.                         </content>
