		<content>      Recreation for the young and old 
 is quite high on the list of local    
 priorities. For some years now land   
 has been sought to provide a{playing  
{field}so that football, tennis,       
 cricket,bowls etc. can be made        
 available. At present there is a      
 thriving football club who play on a  
 field at Buckton. Unfortunately the   
 field, owned by local farmer Mr. Tony 
 Towse, has to accommodate sheep for   
 part of the year.                     
      There are a number of other      
 clubs; for the younger element there  
 are{Beavers, Cubs, Brownies }and a {  
{Youth Club.}For older residents we    
 have a{Snooker}club, {Women's         
{Institute}, {Mother's Union}and an {  
{Over Sixties} club.
