 I went to the Crusty Loaf. We asked   
 questions to the lady and the shop is 
 22 years old. Monday is the day when  
 the most people come in. Saturday is  
 the least popular day when people come
 in. When we were there some people    
 came to get some cakes. They sell     
 health foods and fresh cream. Three   
 people work there.{Philip Hall}Aged 8

 I went to the video shop. We saw lots 
 of videos. I was with Mrs. Holland and
 we went to the Magic Box and the      
 little sweets were 10p. I said,"How   
 old is the building?"The man said "23 
 years old." At the back of the three  
 buildings there is Hotsons and Hotsons
 has 3 telephones. At the wall at the  
 side it said Hotson and Son. Another  
 shop was King and King the Estate     
 Agents.   {Simon Weaver} Aged 8 years </content>
