		<title>02MADELEY STAFFS : POPULATION</title>
		<content> The population of the area is almost  
2350 of all ages from 0-85+.While most 
are English by birth some are Welsh or 
Scots &amp; a few are immigrants.Nearly 75%
of the population live on 1 of 3 modern
estates,the rest living in older type  
housing,spread throughout the area,or  
in the 16 scattered farmsteads on the  
edge of the village.                   
 On the modern estates there is a      
frequent turnover of population some   
10% leaving &amp; moving into the area     
annually.The older houses change hands 
less frequently,however.               
 Of the 1791 people aged 16+,1077 work 
or are seeking employment.209 are      
retired.The remainder is made up of    
women at home &amp; students.When the      
College of Education shut in 1982      
nearly 1200 people left the area-a     
great loss to the communtiy.
