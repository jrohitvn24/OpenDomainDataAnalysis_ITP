		<content> There are several interesting         
 buildings in Brant Broughton:         
   The present Manor House,dated 1766  
 is thought to be part of a barn       
 belonging to the original house.The   
 picturesque almshouses,built in 1860, 
 were intended for poor widows,but this
 restriction has since been lifted.    
 There is a tradition that Joseph      
 Lister once stayed at Lister Place.The
 stone-built Priory is the oldest house
 in the village dating from 1658.      
   There are many imposing buildings   
 along High Street.Grey Garth was the  
 agent's house for the Sutton Estate.  
 Brant House is surrounded by wrought  
 iron work made at the nearby forge,   
 which still operates.The Old House was
 formerly a doctor's surgery and a     
 butcher's.The Old Hall,now a vet's was
 once occupied by the Revd.Swan who    
 added the top floor to house pupils.  </content>
