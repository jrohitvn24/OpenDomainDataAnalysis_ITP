		<title>20THE PLAYGROUP</title>
		<content> THE PLAYGROUP IN CROWLE MEETS A FEW   
 MORNINGS EACH WEEK. THE CHILDREN ARE  
 FOUR YEARS OLD AND ENJOY MANY         
 ACTIVITIES, LIKE PAINTING, BUILDING   
 BRICKS, SAND, WATER, JIGSAWS, DOLLS   
 AND A PLAY HOUSE. SOMETIMES THE       
 CHILDREN GO OUT TO THE PARK OR ON A   
 TRIP. THEY LEARN HOW TO SHARE TOYS AND
 GET ALONG TOGETHER AS PART OF THEIR   
 SOCIAL TRAINING FOR SCHOOL. SOME      
 CHILDREN DO NOT WANT TO LEAVE THEIR   
 MTHERS AND CRY FOR A LONG TIME BEFORE 
 THEY SETTLE AND FIND SOMETHING THAT   
 INTERESTS THEM. OTHERS LIKE MEETING   
 SMALL CHILDREN AND PLAYING TOGETHER.  
 THEY HAVE FUND RAISING EVENTS AND     
 COMPETITIONS TO ENABLE THE PLAYGROUP  
 TO CONTINUE.
