		<title>03Friday Bridge Population</title>
		<content> The population in Friday Bridge is    
 1131. 249 are old age pensioners and  
 222 are children of pre-school and    
 school age. The population has grown  
 greatly since the second world war    
 because of the new developments. The  
 old families are mostly named Bates   
 and Smith and Loughton. They have been
 greatly outnumbered by newcomers. Mr  
 Tom Loughton said that at one time he 
 knew all the people in the village but
 now he does not even know all the     
 people in his road.
