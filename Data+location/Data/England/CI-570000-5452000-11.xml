		<title>11ST. MARTIN'S IN 1985 (3)</title>
		<content>    St. Martin's is still a beautiful  
 parish. Some of the fine old          
 buildings, which had fallen into a    
 state of disrepair have been bought,  
 in many cases by wealthy immigrants,  
 and restored.                         
                                       
    This area, which lies between the  
 picturesque harbour of Rozel and St.  
 Catherine's breakwater, has fine      
 cliff-top walks with outastanding     
 views, looking towards France, just   
 fifteen miles away. One can only hope 
 that the parish will retain its       
 identity and natural beauty, as well  
 as coping with the ever-increasing    
 demands of the fast-approaching 21st  
 century.
