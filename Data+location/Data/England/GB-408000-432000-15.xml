		<title>15Thornton Viaduct</title>
		<content> In Thornton stands a viaduct across   
 Pinch Beck valley. It is a local      
 beauty spot. It is not used any more. 
 It is 150 feet high (50 metres) and it
 has twenty arches. It was built about 
 1870. The railway was built from      
 Halifax to Bradford and then to       
 Thornton. It was at Thornton that the 
 builders ran out of money when they   
 were going to build the line to       
 Keighley. The viaduct had been too    
 expensive to build. It was many       
 years before the line reached         
 Keighley. The railway line was closed 
 in the 1950's. It stands to show us   
 how the Victorians built things.
