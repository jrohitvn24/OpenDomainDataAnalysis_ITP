		<title>03ST.PETERS CHURCH CLATFORD</title>
		<content> The beginning of the church {ST.PETERS
{GOODWORTH CLATFORD}is obscure,but     
 records show that it probably was     
 begun by Saxons in Norman times and   
 was rebuilt roughly in the 13         
 century.The building before was most  
 probably just as small with merely a  
 nave and chancel.                     
 The bells are rung once or twice a    
 week.Round the church is a grass verge
 covered with,graves.A road called{    
{CHURCH LANE}goes down beside the {    
{CHURCH.}By the other side of the      
 church is a farm,but there are also   
 alot of houses round about the church.
 THE STAIN GLASS WINDOWS are a very    
 pretty sight when looked at.On the    
 windows there are signs of Jesus being
 crucified.An altar is a raised table  
 used in {RELIGION}.It was             
 also used originally to sacrifice     
 animals or other gifts to a God.      </content>
