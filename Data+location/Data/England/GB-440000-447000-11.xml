		<content>{ Tick ball}is a game played between   
 several people. One person has to     
 stand with the ball and the other     
 people have to run around. The person 
 with the ball throws it and tries to  
 hit someone. If you hit someone, that 
 person is{on}with you. When every     
 person has been hit with the ball,    
 the first person who was hit by the   
 ball is {on}in the next game. You play
 in this way until every single person 
 has been{on.                          
          {BLACK PUDDING}              
 First you go somewhere where there is 
 a wall or a window. Then the person   
 who is{on}faces the wall. The other   
 people try to walk up to that person. 
 But if the person turns around and    
 sees someone move he or she has to go 
 back to the beginning again. The      
 players have to{tig}the person and say
{"black pudding".                      </content>
