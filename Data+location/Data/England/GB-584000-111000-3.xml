		<title>03ORE, FAIRLIGHT, EAST SUSSEX</title>
		<content> This area includes some of the houses 
 in the part of the town of Hastings,  
 called Ore, as well as the villages of
 Fairlight, Guestling and Pett, East   
 Sussex.                               
                                       
 The housing in this part of Ore has   
 developed between the main A.259      
 coastal road for through traffic from 
 Hastings to Rye, and the minor        
 Fairlight Road from Hastings to       
 Fairlight village.   The houses are on
 the south-east facing slope, rising to
 the viewpoint of North Seat at l75m   
 above sea level.                      
                                       
 The houses are 20th century buildings 
 and are mainly owner occupied.   They 
 are mostly semi-detached family houses
 with two or three bedrooms.   Many of 
 the residents work in Hastings and a  
 few work in Rye.                      </content>
