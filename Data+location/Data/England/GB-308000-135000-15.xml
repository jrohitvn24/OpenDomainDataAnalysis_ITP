    { Halifax Building Society}have    
 recently opened and agency.           
     {Bread Van}brings bread etc from  
 Lydeard St. Lawrence to the Village

 twice weekly.                         
     {Milk }is delivered daily by the  
 paper roundsman to various houses but 
 this is very much a private

 of houses.                            
     {Fish}is sold from a touring van  
 which visits this block once a week.
