		<title>11Maiden Castle's Future</title>
		<content>   The idea of The English Heritage    
 developing Maiden Castle has brought a
 lot of opposition.                    
   Some say it would completely spoil  
 the scenery of the monument which     
 should remain as it has for hundreds  
 of years. Many of the local residents 
 have enjoyed taking their dogs for    
 walks and picnicing and deplore the   
 idea of possibly having to pay to     
 visit Maiden Castle. Others say that  
 many tourists would cause the ramparts
 to erode and roads would be congested.
   However many think that it is a     
 great plan and would bring more       
 visitors and employment to the area.  
 Also it would be good to let others   
 discover this unique hill fort and    
 learn its history. There will be more 
 debate and whatever the outcome lets  
 hope it will be the best for Maiden   
 Castle.                               </content>
