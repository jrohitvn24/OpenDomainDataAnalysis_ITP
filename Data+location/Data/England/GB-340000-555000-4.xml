		<title>04The Lanes Carlisle  (i)</title>
		<content> The Lanes Redevelopment was opened in 
 November 1984 by the Duke of          
 Gloucester when he and a St.Aidan's   
 pupil buried a "time capsule" in the  
 central concourse.{Grapes, Globe,}and 
{New}Lanes provide sheltered thorough- 
 fares for pedestrian shoppers, who    
 have a choice of five major stores    
 (Fine Fare, C &amp; A, County Store,      
 B.H.S. and Mothercare ) and about 40  
 other shops.                          
 The original "Lanes" were mediaeval   
 alleys between Lowther and Scotch     
 Streets, named after inns.Much of the 
 property decayed to the point where   
 whole shops were in danger of         
 collapse. The scheme finally adopted  
 preserved the 18th and 19th century   
 shop fronts of Scotch Street as       
 replicas, and the names of two of the 
 Lanes, if not their original lines.
