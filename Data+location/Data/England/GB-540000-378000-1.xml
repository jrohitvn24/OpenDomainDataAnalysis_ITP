		<content> The area is comprised of scattered    
 farms &amp; small villages, nestling at   
 the foot of the chalk wolds. It is    
 sparsely populated but rich in flora &amp;
 fauna.{Spring waters}feed a           
 fast-flowing well stocked trout river.
 Woodlands consist of coniferous &amp;     
 deciduous trees, with many newly      
 planted along the winding country     
 lanes. A dis-used railway line is rich
 in re-established wild life. The land 
 is well drained, ditches contain some 
 wild flowers. At{Belleau}an ancient   
{dovecot}is sited below a 13th Century 
 church. The population is friendly,   
 self-reliant, hardworking &amp; caring.   
{Claythorpe water mill}is now used as a
 restaurant &amp; private house. An        
 attached smokery is supplied by the   
 local trout farm.
