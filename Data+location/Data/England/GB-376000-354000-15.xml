		<title>15A Day in Nicholas's Life</title>
		<content> On Sunday morning my dad woke my      
 brother Adam early because they were  
 going fishing. Mum got up next and    
 made breakfast for the rest of the    
 family. She called us to get washed   
 and dressed. My eldest brother rushed 
 his breakfast as he was going to work 
 but my big sister stayed in bed beause
 she is lazy. After our meal we went   
 out to play. My twin sister went for a
 bicycle ride and mum prepared lunch.  
 Dad came home at lunch-time,he and    
 Adam had caught seventeen fish. Later 
 we had to put our shoes and coats on  
 and travel by car to Warrington. My   
 brother Jason Had phoned to say his   
 motor-bike had broken down and we went
 to bring him home. It was tea-time    
 when we returned. After tea we watched
 television for a while. At 8:30pm I   
 went to bed.                          
                                       </content>
