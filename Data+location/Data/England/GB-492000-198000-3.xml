		<content> One Day in France I saw some people{  
{Break Dancing}on the pavement and so  
 I decided to learn. The only problem  
 was that no-one could teach me. So I  
 just watched and copied what I saw.   
 It took me about a year to get good   
 enough to entertain over 200 people at
 a dicso. New moves are being made up  
 all the time. For{Break Dancing}the   
 clothes are very important, and so I  
 became interested in what I wear. Now 
 my friends describe me, in a joking   
 way, as a 'poser'.{Break Dancing}also 
 got me interested in music, and now I 
 buy quite a lot of records and tapes. 
{Skateboarding}is still a cheap and    
 enjoyable hobby which has been        
 overtaken by{BMX-ing. BMX-ing}is based
 on entertaining crowds by performing  
 tricks on special light and strong    
 bicycles. You need a lot of expensive 
 equipment and the right clothes.      </content>
