The farmhouse at White Cross is typical
of the area. It is built from red brick
and has ten rooms. Outside there are 29
outhouses   and  barns.  The  farm   is
divided  into  fifteen  fields.   Crops
grown include grass, wheat and barley. 
The  farm used to concentrate on  dairy
cattle  but  the  dairy  apparatus  has
recently  been dismantled.  Cattle  are
now reared for beef. The main breeds on
the farm are Limousin, Charolais and  a
cross  between Hereford  and  Friesian.
There are also eighty-five Suffolk ewes
and two sheepdogs.
