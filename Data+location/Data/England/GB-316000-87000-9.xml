		<title>09BRANSCOMBE PRIMARY SCHOOL.</title>
		<content> The school is one hundred and seven   
 years old.When the school was opened  
 53 children came and in that year it  
 rose to nearly a hundred .Mr Tomkins  
 the vicar of Branscombe gave a site   
 and raised some money through         
 collections and grants to build the   
 school. There is a school house next  
 door but it is no longer used.Most of 
 the children walked to school,many    
 walking 2 miles or more.In the war    
 times children were evacuacted from   
 the big cities.One teacher came to    
 Branscombe with her class of 25       
 children.They had their lessons in the
 dining room.At the moment there are 31
 children in our school. We have two   
 classes.The P.T.A.have helped the     
 school for many years organising May  
 Day celebrations, pancake races,      
 bonfire parties and other fund raising
 functions.                            </content>
