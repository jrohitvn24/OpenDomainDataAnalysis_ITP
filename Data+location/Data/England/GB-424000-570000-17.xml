		<content> Mrs. Bennett is a councillor for      
our area and also a governor of our    
school, Delaval Primary.               
 She was born at West Moor and lives   
nearby. She says she enjoyed school,   
especially running. She has lived in   
Forest Hall for over 40 years and has  
seen lots of changes  take place,      
particularly the increase in population
and the growth of Killingworth.        
 As a councillor Mrs. Bennett enjoys   
working for the local community. Two   
years ago she was lady mayoress of     
North Tyneside.                        
 Mrs. Bennett has been a governor of   
our school for a number of years, and  
follows in the footsteps of her mother 
who was also a governor here.          
 Like all good "Geordies", Mrs Bennett 
supports Newcastle United Football     
Club.
