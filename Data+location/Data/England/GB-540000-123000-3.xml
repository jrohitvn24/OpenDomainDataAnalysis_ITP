 Fletching's chief claim to fame is    
 that on the eve of the Battle of Lewes
 1264 Simon de Montfort came with his  
 barons to pray and receive the Holy   
 Sacrament at Fletching Church.        
 Their victory at Lewes led to the     
 calling of a Parliament in which the  
 germ of the House of Commons may be   
 seen. A legend tells how a number of  
 de Montfort's Knights, slain at the   
 battle, were buried in full armour    
 beneath the nave. Part of this floor  
 is due to be lifted and replaced next 
 year so further investigations may be 
 carried out. A glance at the visitors'
 book in the church shows that this    
 historic event attracts a steady      
 stream of tourists from The UK, Europe
 , USA.     {D Skan}                   </content>
