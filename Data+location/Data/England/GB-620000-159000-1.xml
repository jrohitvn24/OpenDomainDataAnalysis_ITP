		<content>     This area is very agricultural, a 
 rural district; there is a variety of 
 crops including apples, pears, grass  
 and a lot of corn. Altogether there   
 are ten farms most of which grow      
 arable crops or fruit; in the{        
{Stodmarsh village }area and on{Seaton 
{Marsh}cattle and sheep are reared.    
     The{nature reserve}south-east of  
 Hersden was once covered by sea,      
 separating the Isle of Thanet from the
 mainland; it is now lakes and reeds.  
     This is a quiet area with only    
 small communities such as{Stodmarsh   
 and some of{Wickhambreaux Village.    
     There are three valleys in this   
 district; the{Little Stour Valley,}the
{Great Stour Valley}and the{Lampen }   
{Stream Valley.}The Great Stour flows  
 north-east to{Grove Ferry,}as does the
 Little Stour and they meet at{Plucks  
{Gutter.                               </content>
