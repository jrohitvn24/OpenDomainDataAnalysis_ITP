		<title>16BESIDE THE DEBEN AT SUTTON</title>
		<content>   The distinction between bridlepaths 
   and footpaths is important to the   
   cyclist but a sandy farm track gives
   no indication of what it is.        
{On Sunday, the 2nd June 1985, our     
{ignorance was soon to be put right by 
{Sir Anthony Quilter's head gamekeeper.
{But he soon became most helpful when  
{he learned that we were on the        
{Domesday Survey and that we were from 
{Woodbridge School. His son had recent-
{ly left our school, to go to an       
{agricultural college.                 
   We cycled on in brilliant hot       
   sunshine down a track towards the   
   River Deben. It was low tide, but   
   the edge of the estuary was still   
   very marshy as the promised         
   riverside track disappeared into the
   undergrowth. Our progress slowed as 
   we carried our bicycles             
   along the marshy river margin.      </content>
