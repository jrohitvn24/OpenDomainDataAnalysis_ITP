       Our school was opened in 1914   
and originally it was two separate     
schools from 1914-1937. The schools    
joined together in 1937.After the      
Second World War it became Whitley Bay 
Grammar School. Since 1973 it has been 
known as Marden Bridge Middle School.  
                                       
  The age of the children at this      
schoolo  is 9-13 years .The children   
that come to this school will          
have been to a first school from 5-9   
years of age.After a child has been to 
first and middle school he has to go   
to a high school from   13-16 or 18 if 
he stays on to get his "A" levels.     
  Our school is a     comprehensive    
school and this means a school for all 
abilities,but in 1945 you had to pass  
an exam to get into this school.       
   I think our school is   fairly good </content>
