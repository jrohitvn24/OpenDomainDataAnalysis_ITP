		<content>   One recent study was on the subject 
 of government and the children began  
 the work with a visit to the Town     
 Council. Then they visited the        
 District Council. They were allowed to
 hold a mock council meeting in the    
 Council Chamber at the County         
 Buildings. They followed this with a  
 visit to Parliament, and invited their
 local member of Parliament into the   
 school for 'Question Time'.           
    Another study was concerned with   
 the police force and a police woman   
 spent a term  working with the        
 children.She organised visits to the  
 local police station,to police        
 training centres,and to the Thames    
 River police.The children visited the 
 Law Courts and enacted a mock trial   
 with themselves taking the place of   
 the various people in the court room.
