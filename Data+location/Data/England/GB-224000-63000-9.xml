		<content> Liskeard's main sporting facilities   
 are provided at the town's Sports     
 Centre.A swimming pool,squash and     
 tennis courts are complemented by     
 three major games fields.These are,   
 however,restricted to club use.The    
 junior school survey found that by    
 far the most popular pastime is       
 swimming, followed by a variety of    
 other watersports. Liskeard,just 9    
 miles away from the coast and with    
 nearby reservoirs and rivers,has ample
 opportunities for watersports.        
 All facilities are organized and      
 run by adults.Surprisingly there is a 
 noticeable interest in boxing.Away    
 from opportunities for sports there   
 are a variety of clubs and societies  
 organized for the young that include, 
 for example,Brownies,Boys'Brigade,Tap 
 and Ballet dancing,Fencing and Judo.
