		<title>12ELASTIC SKIPPING</title>
		<content> A GAME TO PLAY AT SCHOOL OR HOME.     
 You need a long piece of elastic with 
 the ends tied together and at least 3 
 people.Two people stand with the      
 elastic stretched as far as possible, 
 round their ankles.The 3rd person puts
 one leg in the middle and the other on
 the outside of the elastic.They jump  
 to the other side into the same       
 position.They repeat this 4 times. Now
 they jump with both legs into the     
 middle,then both legs outside the     
 elastic. Jump again to stand with one 
 foot on each piece of elastic,then    
 both feet off.Repeat these and other  
 variations with the elastic round the 
 shins, knees and thighs,as wide as you
 can and with just 1 foot in the       
 elastic.                              
 If you are alone tie the elastic round
 a chair, post, tree,dustbin or        
 anything that is handy.               </content>
