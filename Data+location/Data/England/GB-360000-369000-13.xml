		<title>13VALE ROYAL ABBEY, WHITEGATE</title>
		<content> The 708-year old abbey was originally 
 a Cistercian monastery until it was   
 bought by Edward 1.  There are over   
 100 rooms and one of the main rooms is
 the Great Hall.  The ceiling is       
 covered with the coats of arms of the 
 Cholmondeleys and the families they   
 married into.  Pulleys raise and lower
 the candelabra from the ceiling.      
 Another important room is the Dining  
 Hall which has an Italian door.       
 Now the private owner intends to      
 convert the Abbey into approximately  
 16 luxury flats to finance the        
 renovation.  This will take 2 years or
 more.                                 
 The Great Hall is used mainly for     
 functions such as banquets and        
 weddings.  Even when part of the Abbey
 is rented the Great Hall will always  
 be available to be seen by            
 appointment.                          </content>
