		<title>14LOCAL CUSTOMS OF BARSBY</title>
		<content>  Many English villages are steeped in 
 loacal history and customs. Barsby is 
 no exception and after interviewing   
 Mrs Yates and Mr Warringtom we were   
 given an insight into the wealth and  
 variety of village customs.           
  A traditional celebration held in the
 village was the Barsby Feast. It was  
 held on August Bank holiday Monday in 
 Burgins field, burgins was one of the 
 local farmers. All the villagers would
 share the preperation of the food.    
  On Mayday schoolchildren formed a    
 procession which was led by the may   
 queen. They pareded around the village
 singing and dancing. As a reward for  
 their songs  the villagers gave them  
 money.                                
   On Guy Fawkes night school boys     
 travelled around the village with     
 hollowed out turnips with candles in  
 them.                                 </content>
