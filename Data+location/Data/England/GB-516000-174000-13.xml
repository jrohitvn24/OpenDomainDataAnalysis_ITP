		<title>13A TYPICAL DAY FOR MELANIE</title>
		<content> It's 7 am and time to get up.I go to  
 the wardrobe and put my school clothes
 on and rush downstairs to have        
 breakfast: bacon, sausage, egg and a  
 nice refreshing cup of tea.I then go  
 to the kitchen and get my sandwiches, 
 crisps,chocolate and a drink. Then    
 I get my homework and I do it for ten 
 minutes .I say goodbye and set off for
 school.I travel by bus; it costs 15   
 pence. I arrive at St Elizabeths at 9 
 am and play for 10 minutes until the  
 bell goes - it hurts my ears - and    
 then we go to our class. We have      
 Religion; after that we have 45       
 minutes of Maths. Playtime follows    
 shortly and after we have English     
 (that's my favourite). At lunch time  
 we eat for half-an-hour and then we go
 out to play. The bell rings at 1:15   
 and we go in; we have Science, Art,   
 Geography or History.                 </content>
