		<title>06FLEETWOOD MOUNT: PART TWO.</title>
		<content>           by Vikki Taylor             
    My mother told me that at the back 
 of the Mount years ago there was a    
 playground with swings and slides. At 
 Easter, on Easter Sunday, all the     
 children used to paint hard-boiled    
 eggs and roll them down in front of   
 the Mount. The grass was covered with 
 daisies in the summer and she used to 
 make daisy chains. You could still    
 walk round the inside of the pavilion 
 and the old, outside swimming pool was
 still there.                          
    At Easter I still roll eggs from   
 the top to the bottom of the Mount.   
 The playground, dismantled when I was 
 7 because it had been vandalized, has 
 been rebuilt and directly opposite the
 Mount there is now a Leisure Centre,  
 an amusement arcade called Corrigans  
 and a new Surf Divers' Club. The Mount
 still means fun for children in 1985. </content>
