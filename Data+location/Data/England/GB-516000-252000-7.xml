		<content> The village hall is the main centre of
 village organised activities.The      
 retired population play bowls on the  
 two recently restored greens.The      
 Woman's Institute after a  lapse of   
 12years have started to meet again.The
 youngsters of the village can go to   
 the hall to play badmington and       
 snooker.                              
 When we interviewed teenagers of the  
 village they all agreed that they     
 liked Temspford as a place but there  
 was very little to do for their age   
 range and the main problem for being  
 able to get out and about was the lack
 of public transport.The village has a 
 bus service to Bedford every two hours
 during the day but no late evening    
 services.On local market days a       
 service bus stops near Tempsford to go
 to Sandy and St.Neots.
