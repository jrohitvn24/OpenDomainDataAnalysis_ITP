		<content> Faulkland Green is the only unenclosed
 open space in the parish, though there
 was another unenclosed are on         
 Faulkland Knoll until the early 19th  
 century when it was divided into      
 allotments.  The stocks on the Green  
 are almost certainly a 19th century   
 copy of earlier ones. the only public 
 or community buildings in the village 
 are the Methodist chapel and the      
 village hall, which was once the      
 school.  There are very few even      
 pre-19th century buildings in the     
 village, and these are on or close to 
 the Green.  Of the 99 houses in       
 Faulkland, the tenure is:
