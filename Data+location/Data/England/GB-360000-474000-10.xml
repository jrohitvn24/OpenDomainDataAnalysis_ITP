		<content> Even as little as fifty years ago     
 people lived where they worked because
 of transport difficulties.Lots more   
 people worked on the land. Often girls
 worked in in the farm house,vicarage  
 or large country house.As well as     
 working on the farms there was        
 employment at the village cobblers,   
 black smith and two village           
 shops.People now live here but work in
 towns like Lancaster and Kendal.They  
 work a lot further away now because   
 transport is a lot better.A lot more  
 people in this area are professional  
 people now. They can afford to live in
 the country and drive to work in the  
 towns. The few people who still work  
 locally often find it hard to afford  
 houses here when they get married.They
 work in farming, haulage, warehousing,
 building, and joinery trades.
