		<title>09Sandford House - Today</title>
		<content> Today Sandford House and the outside  
 buildings have been turned into{twenty
{flats.}The family who owned the house 
 have moved away, and all the flats    
 are sold.                             
                                       
 The house still looks the same as it  
 did when it was a family home and the 
 flats have not spoiled the house.     
                                       
 A gardener comes once a month to tend 
 the garden. A{wellingtonia tree}is now
 taller than the house. Wild rabbits   
 still live in the garden. Garages have
 been  built  for the owners of the    
 flats, and the stables have been      
 changed into a flat.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
