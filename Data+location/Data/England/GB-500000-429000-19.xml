		<title>19WILLERBY CENTRE SURVEY</title>
		<content> Survey conducted in Willerby's main   
 shopping area in July by two pupils,  
 Tracey Taylor and Annabel Gould.      
    Shopping.                          
  We interviewed twenty-seven people.  
 Nearly every person we talked to said 
 that the shops needed improving.Most  
 shops were too small, the choice of   
 goods sometimes limited and most      
 things were more expensive than in the
 large supermarkets.Nearly everyone    
 thought the shopkeepers were friendly 
 and helpful though and the shops were 
 handy for fresh foods and the odd     
 items you forgot.There was even a     
 large, council carpark next to the    
 shops that added to the convenience.  
   Most people went to Hessle (where a 
 new Sainsbury's hypermarket had       
 recently opened,Beverley or Hull to do
 their main shopping.
