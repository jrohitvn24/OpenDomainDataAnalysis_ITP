		<title>10EMPLOYMENT IN THE AREA.</title>
		<content>  In 1981 the population of the parish 
 of Nonington was 646.Our survey showed
 that most of the Nonongton            
 schoolchildren's mums and dads work   
 locally.                              
  We found that most of the mums go out
 to work either full or part time, and 
 they are employed in Nonington,       
 Canterbury, Deal and Ash.             
  There is a lot of farmland in the    
 area and approximately 10% of the dads
 work on the land. About the same      
 number work at either one of the      
 collieries of Tilmanstone or Snowdown.
  A few dads are self employed and most
 of the others have jobs based in      
 either Canterbury or Dover, and these 
 involve travelling to other parts of  
 the south east.
