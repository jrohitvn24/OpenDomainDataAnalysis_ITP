		<content> I get up at 7:00am with Dad shouting  
 from the bathroom. I have breakfast,  
 cereal and toast, and go to school. I 
 get to school at about 9:OO and play  
 and chat in the playground. School    
 starts at 9:30. We have register while
 we read for twenty minutes. Then we   
 start work. We have play at 10.45 for 
 fifteen minutes. Then we work until   
 half past 12, which is dinner time.   
 Some of us have sandwiches, some      
 cooked dinner and some go home. Then  
 we play on the playground or field    
 until 1.30. Sometimes we have         
 assembly, which lasts about 20 minutes
 and finishes at 3.30. After school    
 I go home and play. I have my tea,    
 which is usually a cooked meal at     
 6:00. Then I play till 7:00. I usually
 watch T.V. and go to bed at 8:00 ready
 for school in the morning.
