		<title>16Beating The Bounds</title>
		<content> During Rogation-tide the parish       
 clergyman used to walk round the      
 parish boundaries with his church     
 officials and other parishioners and  
 followed by the boys of the parish    
 school.The boys carried willow canes  
 and at various points struck the      
 boundary with them.Because it was such
 a bad experience,being bumped on      
 stones,dragged through hedges and     
 ditches,and thrown into streams and   
 ponds,it was thought that the boys    
 would never forget their parish       
 boundary.                             
    Our school took part in a local    
 Beating the Bounds walk.It was held on
 the 11th of May 1985 and it was 10\   
 miles.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
