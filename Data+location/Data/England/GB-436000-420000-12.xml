		<title>12        HOBBIES</title>
		<content> My hobby is swimming.I go to the baths
 a lot.I can do the breast stroke and  
 the back stroke but I'm no good at the
 crawl.I have passed my elementary test
 and my proficiency test.For my        
 elementary I had to do a length any   
 stroke.For my proficiency I had to do 
 a neat dive from the side of the pool 
 and four lengths of any stroke.I used 
 to go to the baths every Sunday       
 morning with my dad but now I don't   
 because it doesn't open any more on a 
 Sunday.For swimming you take your     
 clothes off and put on a fancy costume
 which is a specially for swimming.    
 Swimming is a way of transporting your
 self through water.You swim for       
 leisure and it's fun.
