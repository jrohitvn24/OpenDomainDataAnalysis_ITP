		<content>   Alvis is a big farmer. He owns all  
 the land around us. He keeps pigs,    
 cows, sheep and poultry. He has 32    
 farms, 200 tractors and employs 300   
 workers.                              
   By the side of the A38 he owns a big
 farm shop. This is situated about one 
 mile from Bristol Airport. He sells   
 dairy produce and meat. The Womens    
 Institute supplies him with honey,    
 jam, bread and fruit.                 
   When I went to his slaughter house I
 saw the method used to "process" the  
 cows: Workers put an electric shock   
 through it to kill it and then put it 
 in boiling water to get rid of the    
 hairs. To get the blood out they slit 
 its neck. Finally they remove the     
 leather and put it on a trailer to    
 make slippers with wool inside, or    
 aprons to sell and use at the farms.
