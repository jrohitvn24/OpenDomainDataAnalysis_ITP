		<content> The only area with any degree         
 of modern housing was in Purleigh     
 village. Elsewhere the housing ranged 
 from very old, vast buildings many of 
 which had been restored to tiny       
 cottages, many of them farmers tied   
 cottages, which had few basic         
 amenities. We found several houses    
 with not only no main drainage but in 
 some cases no electricity either. Some
 were built directly on the bare ground
 with no foundations.                  
   The local planning department at    
 Maldon informs us that there are no   
 plans for further housing development 
 in the area in the near future.
