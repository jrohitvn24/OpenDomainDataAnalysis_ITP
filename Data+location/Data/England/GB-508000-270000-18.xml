		<content>   The main organisation in Stow Longa 
 is the small but active Women's       
 Institute, which meets each month at  
 the home of one of the members.   It  
 offers a varied programme of talks and
 demonstrations, as well as the        
 opportunity for members to participate
 in competitions and classes at county 
 level.                                
   A small youth club, which meets in  
 the changing room at Catworth playing 
 field, is well supported by children  
 from the village.   Many also attend  
 Brownie, Cub, Guide and Scout meetings
 at Brington or Kimbolton.             
   A number of adults belong to clubs  
 outside the area: Catworth Women's    
 Institute offers a similar programme  
 to the one at Stow Longa, while the   
 Floral, Local History and Music       
 Societies at Kimbolton are also       
 popular.                              </content>
