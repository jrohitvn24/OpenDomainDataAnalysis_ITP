  To the north and west of Horninglow  
Rd.,is an area of housing built in the 
1960's.Until that time this was land   
used for agriculture.The houses are    
mostly semi-detached,although there are
some four-blocks and some detached.They
are small houses and were intended for 
first time buyers.The building of this 
estate greatly increased the number of 
children on roll at William Hutson and 
other schools.The fourth area is west  
of Calais Rd.This is mainly Edwardian  
terraced housing with small front and  
rear gardens.Some have been demolished 
to make way for three small blocks of  
flats.In this area there is also a     
post-office and a public house.
