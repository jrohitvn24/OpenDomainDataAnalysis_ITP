		<title>11lst IMPRESSIONS OF GRIMSARGH</title>
		<content>                                       
I have recently moved to Grimsargh from
a village near Hull.  Mt first         
impression was it was a minute village 
with nothing going on.  But I was      
wrong.There was a garden party almost  
as soon as I arrived and a Field Day   
sometime later and people have told me 
that there are quite a few other       
village events.  I'm surprised some    
people have any spare time.  I think it
has more vandalism than where I used to
live.  There was  hardly any vandalism 
at all.  The rec. is larger and the    
village hall is bigger as well.  But   
although it is smaller, Grimsargh is   
just as good as where I used to live.  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
