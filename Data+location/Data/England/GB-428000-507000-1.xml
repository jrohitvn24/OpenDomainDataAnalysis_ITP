  This is a rural block with its three 
 main residential areas sited in North 
 Yorkshire and Durham County. The      
 border of the counties is the River   
 Tees which separates the villages of  
 Croft on Tees and Hurworth Place. The 
 third village of Dalton on Tees, which
 is in North Yorkshire, is the only one
 which is growing in size.             
  Much of the land is used for         
 agricultural purposes in forestry,    
 grain,rape,dairy farming,roots,pigs,  
 beef and sheep, with facilities for   
 fishing and shooting.                 
  A number of residents retired here   
 but there is  a cross-section of all  
 ages in the area. Although there are  
 not a lot of recreational facilities  
 in the area, Brownies and Guides meet 
 weekly in Croft, and the W.I. meets   
 monthly at Dalton.                    </content>
