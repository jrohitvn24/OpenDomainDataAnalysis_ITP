		<title>12AN INDUSTRIAL ESTATE</title>
		<content>   There are several small industrial  
 estates on the outskirts of Cranleigh,
 two of them in disused Brickworks, but
 we went to visit the oldest one called
 Little Mead Estate.                   
   There are many different types of   
 firm in different types of building in
 a quiet cul de sac. The Home Counties 
 Dairy have a big depot and the new    
 Ambulance Station is there.           
   Another firm are importers of       
 Italian Motorcycles. A company who    
 make Electronic Flow Meters said they 
 came to Cranleigh because they needed 
 more space and they had no trouble    
 finding employees, they did find the  
 distance from London was a problem.   
   Another wholesale book company said 
 it did not matters where they were    
 because they did business by mail     
 order and they found the premises and 
 facilities ideal.                     </content>
