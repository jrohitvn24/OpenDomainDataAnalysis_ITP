		<content> Families generally are small and life 
 centres around the home and community.
 Transport is difficult and many       
 families run two cars.  As the        
 children grow up, many mothers return 
 to work at least part-time.  Children 
 tend to leave home by the age of l8   
 often to further education.           
 Although the ability to cook well is  
 considered important, because of the  
 time factor, many rely on pre-packed  
 convenience foods.  Emphasis is put on
 healthy eating and many families have 
 freezers for their own and bought     
 produce. Shopping is done either      
 weekly or monthly in supermarkets.    
 Microwave ovens and automatic washing 
 machines and other labour saving      
 gadgets are in common use. For busy   
 families the emphasis today is on     
 saving  time.
