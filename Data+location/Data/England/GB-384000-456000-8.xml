		<title>08A Hellifield Farm</title>
		<content>    Tenley Farm, lies near to the A65  
 Keighley to Kendal trunk road about a 
 mile from the village of Hellifield.  
 It once formed part of the Tenley     
 Estate which covered many acres of    
 land around Peel Castle at Hellifield,
 and lies adjacent to Peel Wood.       
    The farm is situated in the Craven 
 District which is a grassland area    
 where livestock is kept for dairy,    
 beef and lamb production. Tenley Farm 
 now covers 94 acres together with 170 
 acres of offlying land which carries  
 320 lambing sheep, producing 600 lambs
 and 140 beef cattle which are reared  
 from calves.The fat lambs and cattle  
 are sold at Hellifield Auction Mart.  
    Silage is made in June, and then a 
 second crop is obtained in August for 
 feeding to the cattle kept inside in  
 winter. Hay , harvested in July, is   
 used for winter feed for the sheep.   </content>
