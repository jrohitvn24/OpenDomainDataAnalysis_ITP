  Until recently this small hamlet was 
 on the old A.38.The new road has      
 relieved traffic going through the    
 village.                              
  The main road is made up of{terraced 
{houses and semi-detached cottages     
 which were built at the turn of the   
 century.It has two{pubs,}one{General  
{store}and{Post-Office.}The dominating 
 aspect is the{Horticultural Machinery 
 manufacturers HARRIS of DEVON. A      
 recently built small development of   
{bungalows}has been added to the       
 existing{council houses.              
  At the west end of the hamlet is a   
 sales office and workshop for a       
{refrigeration and air-conditioning
