      The actual farm is a{livestock   
 farm ,there are about 50 cows ,300    
 sheep ,450 lambs and 1 bull.The cows  
 are mainly Fresians but there are some
 other breeds.The calves are sold to   
 other farms to be stored.The sheep and
 lambs are also sold but another income
 is their wool which is sold to a      
{Dartington factory}.The farm has      
 grazing rights on{dartmoor}from about 
 July-September.This can cause problems
 as disease can spread very easily.
