		<content>  The picturesque village of Gimingham 
 lies in a valley on the banks of the  
 Mun, a rivulet which empties into the 
 sea at Mundesley a mile away.         
  The church is set in an attractive   
 group of trees quite near the large   
 village pond. The pond is really the  
 dam to supply power for the former    
 water-mill which burnt down in 1979.  
  The mill site and nearby barns have  
 now been renovated and turned into    
 domestic properties and the are other 
 small estates in the village.         
  "Gallows Hill" and the Pound for     
 stray animals remind us of the village
 past.There is a mystry about the      
 place. somewhere in the parish is a   
 palace belonging to John of Gaunt,    
 father of Henry 1V.                   
  The surrounding area is rolling farm-
 land, with three farms and two riding 
 schools in the area.                  </content>
