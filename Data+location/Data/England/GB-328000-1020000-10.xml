		<title>10DOUNBY LEGEND: "QUEER"</title>
		<content> There are two{legends}about "Queer".  
 "Queer" is an old house belonging to  
 the Church of Scotland built on the   
 side of{Greeny Hill}and looking down  
 on the{Loch of Sabiston.}Nowadays it  
 is deserted but long ago two old      
 ladies lived there and it was         
 surrounded by a forest.               
 In one legend they burnt down the     
 forest because some wild animal which 
 lived in the forest had killed one of 
 the ladies' cows.                     
 In the second, robbers and thieves are
 supposed to have hidden in the forest.
 They tormented the ladies until they  
 burnt down the forest to get rid of   
 them.                                 
 Afterwards, realising what they had   
 done they moved out. One lady went to 
 live in the Evie Manse while the other
 moved to the Birsay Manse.
