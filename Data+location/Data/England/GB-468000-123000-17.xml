		<content> Parkwood Arts Light Industry is run as
 a joint business. It was started 22   
 years ago in Sussex and has been based
 outside Langrish for the past seven   
  years where the rates are cheaper    
 and there are larger premises. Some 20
 people are employed at the factory    
 built in a disused farm. They come to 
 work from as far as Havant, Midhurst  
 and Sutton Scotney. The company makes 
 wooden boxes which are fitted with    
 wooden slot racks for holding highly  
 accurate metal gauge blocks.The raw   
 materials are wood imported from      
 Brazil, Rumania, Africa and the Far   
 East. Beech plywood is also used. The 
 finished boxes are sold in the        
 United Kingdom and overseas, for an   
 average price of Â£25. The company is  
 growing steadily and produces 4000    
 boxes a month.
