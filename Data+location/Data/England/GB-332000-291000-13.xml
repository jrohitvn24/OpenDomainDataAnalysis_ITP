		<title>13LANDSCAPE - Lydham/More</title>
		<content> Our rural{landscape}is level pasture  
 and arable encircled by hills, highest
 is 1400 feet; some with mixed wood or 
 grazing. Rocky slopes contain old     
 quarries and mine workings. West Onny 
 river runs south by Linley and More.  
 Notable{buildings}include the parish  
 churches Lydham and More, Linley Hall 
 (Palladian mid C18th house) and       
 Roveries built 1810. Farmhouses       
 (altered inside over the years to     
 provide comfort) are examples of      
 vernacular building. More Farm,Church 
 Farm,Partridge,Upper Bent, and Newton 
 Farms have timber-framing. Cottages   
 are built where needed for workers;the
 oldest in limestone rubble stonework, 
 as Bromleysmill,Lydham Mill, Avenue &amp; 
 Linley Lodges, &amp; Old Smithy. Newer are
 brick-built, but all are set in       
 well-tended gardens and many house    
 those who work in the area.           </content>
