		<title>14Brocklesby Station</title>
		<content> Brocklesby station as a station is    
 almost derelict now.It is owned by    
 British Rail &amp; is a listed building.  
 The Prince Regent in the 1860's       
 alighted here on his way to visit     
 the Yarboroughs at Brocklesby Park.   
 This, and also the Earl of Yarborough 
 owning much stock in the Railway      
 Companies led to elaborate station    
 buildings and first class waiting     
 room.These are now for sale.          
 The houses attached to the station    
 were formerly occupied by railway     
 employees. The houses were sold in    
 the 1962 Beeching cuts,one of them to 
 a railway employee.                   
 About 8 passenger trains stop here    
 everyday.Few people get on or off.    
 Many freight trains use this line.    
 Iron ore from Immingham is taken to   
 B.S.C. at Scunthorpe.Oil and Coal     
 pass here on their journey inland.    </content>
