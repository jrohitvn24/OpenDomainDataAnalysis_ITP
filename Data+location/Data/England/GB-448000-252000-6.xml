		<title>06BYFIELD FESTIVALS(SEPT-DEC)</title>
		<content>IN OCTOBER THERE IS ANOTHER FESTIVAL.IT
IS CALLED THE OLD TIME MUSIC HALL.THIS 
IS MORE OF AN ADULT SHOW AS YOUNG      
CHILDREN WOULD FIND IT BORING.         
NEVERTHELESS  SOME OLDER CHILREN DO GO 
TO IT.IT COSTS BETWEEN 2 AND 3 POUNDS  
TO GET IN BUT FOR THIS YOU GET A FISH  
AND CHIP DINNER AT THE INTERVAL AND A  
DRINK AS WELL.ALTOGETHER IT IS A VERY  
PLEASANT NIGHT OUT AND IT IS A LOT     
CHEAPER THAN THE THEATRE.IN DECEMBER,  
THE SCHOOL PERFORMS ITS PLAYS.THE MAIN 
PLAY IS PERFORMED BY THE TOP 2 CLASSES 
BUT THE INFANTS AND LOWER JUNIORS PUT  
ONE ON AS WELL.IT COSTS 50P.TO GET IN  
TO SEE ALL OF THEM BUT THE TOP 2       
CLASSES DO A SEPARATE PERFORMANCE FOR  
THE OVER-SIXTIES.LAST YEAR WE ACTED OUT
PINNOCHIO,BASED ON THE FAMOUS BOOK.    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
