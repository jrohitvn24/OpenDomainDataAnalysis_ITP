		<title>08LIVING IN THE COUNTRYSIDE</title>
		<content> The country is a nice place to live   
 because you can see different kinds of
 animals and different wild flowers.In 
 the country you can make dens and you 
 can see the combines combining the    
 fields or ploughing.The country is    
 nice because you have nice smells and 
 its not so noisy as a town.Most people
 like it in the country because they   
 can go for walks up the footpaths. You
 can walk up the hill and find a good  
 place to picnic.You could get a beaut-
 iful view and take some photographs.  
 The country has fewer shops than town.
 Most people would prefer to live in   
 the country because it's quieter.There
 is a lot of nature about.There are not
 any cinemas in the country.I like to  
 live in the country because there is  
 more space to play.In a town it is all
 built-up but in the country there are 
 woods to explore where we make dens.  </content>
