		<title>04BATH RUGBY FOOTBALL CLUB</title>
		<content> Bath R.F.C. was founded in 1865. The  
 present team is probably the best     
 ever.They have won the John Player    
 Cup for the past two years.The first  
 time, they beat Bristol 10-9,the      
 second time they beat London Welsh    
 24-15.Bath has ten current England    
 internationals.They have a large      
 following of people from Bath and the 
 West Country.Their average home gate  
 is 4-5,000. 20,000 people are said to 
 have supported them in the John Player
 Cup Final at Twickenham.The current   
 good team has changed the image of    
 Bath from being a tourist centre with 
 a rugby team,into one of the rugby    
 strongholds of Britain.The city is    
 now known as a rugby centre the world 
 over.
