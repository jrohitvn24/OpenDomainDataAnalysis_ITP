		<title>18 STUDS IN EXNING</title>
		<content>The studs in this area are Brickfield, 
Hamilton, Northmore, Plantation and    
Red House.The studs are either public, 
private or a combination of both. A    
public stud is one which accepts mares 
from outside owners for covering by    
their stallions. A private stud is     
one which has its own mares which go   
to other studs for covering and which  
return to the home stud to foal. Most  
foals are sold as yearlings at         
Newmarket Sales. Three of the local    
studs own one or two stallions each.   
One does not have enough land to       
accommodate a stallion. The breeding   
season is from February 15 to July 15. 
The stallions will cover about 45 mares
in a season. Foals are usually born    
between January and May. The gestation 
period for horses is about 11 months.  
In the 1985 season 47 colts and 58     
fillies were born on the five studs.   </content>
