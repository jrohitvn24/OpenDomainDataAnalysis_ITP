		<title>04New Estate in Chelmsford (1)</title>
		<content>   We have interviewed many people on  
 the{Newlands Spring estate}ranging    
 from some of the children in our      
 school to some of the elderly people  
 to find out what facilities there are 
 for them and some of the things that  
 the estate does not provide that they 
 would like to see. The{facilities}for 
 people to enjoy themselves are{limited
 although there are some things for the
 children. There are play areas but    
 many would like to see a small        
 swimming pool.{The children generally 
{like the estate}because they have many
 friends close by to play with. Most of
 the{adults would like}the estate to   
 have a proper{community centre}where  
 people could come together for social 
 occasions. We found from asking that a
 community centre would encourage the  
 elderly people to come out into the   
 community rather than staying at home.</content>
