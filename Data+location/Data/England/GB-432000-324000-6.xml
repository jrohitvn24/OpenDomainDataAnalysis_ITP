 On Saturday I was playing on a tree in
 my Grandad's garden. I was making a   
 tree house out of wood and I fell out 
 the tree and banged my arm hard on    
 the ground,  it hurt me and I cried.  
 The next day it was still hurtting so 
 my Mum took me to the hospital and I  
 had a X-Ray they found out that my arm
 was broken . Then they put my arm in  
 plaster and then I went home. After   
 three weeks I had my plaster off.

{   FARMING                            
 In 1902  the farmers grew mainly      
 wheat,barley,turnips,potatoes and     
 mangols for the cattle.The mangols    
 were pulped in a ginny ring,which was 
 driven by a horse going round in      
 circles.
