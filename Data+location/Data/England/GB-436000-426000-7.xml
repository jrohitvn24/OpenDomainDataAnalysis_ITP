 The most popular sport at the moment  
 is badminton,but it used to be        
 squash.The most popular days are      
 Monday to Friday,from about 5'o clock 
 to 9'o clock.About thirty people are  
 employed at the sports centre though  
 most of them are part time staff like 
 bar staff and cleaners.The sports     
 centre is not doing so well so the    
 sauna and the snack bar have been     
 closed down.The new manager is making 
 special offers to try to get more     
 people in.
