		<title>15HYDROLOGY STUDY BALQUHIDDER</title>
		<content>   The Institute of Hydrology is       
 involved in a programme of fieldwork  
 in the Balquhidder area to study the  
 effects of forestry on streamflow.    
   Due to the rising prices and reduced
 availability of timber for import, an 
 expansion of forestry is taking place 
 in Britain, much of it in the Scottish
 uplands. With the expansion of        
 forestry in Scotland the Institute of 
 Hydrology was asked by the Forestry   
 Commission and the Hydro Electric     
 Board to carry out a study in Kirkton 
 and Upper Monachyle Glens. The        
 Institute has for many years been     
 studying the effect of forestry on    
 streamflow in upland Wales where the  
 climatic conditions are very different
 to those of the Highlands of Scotland.
   The Balquhidder study is expected to
 take five years.
