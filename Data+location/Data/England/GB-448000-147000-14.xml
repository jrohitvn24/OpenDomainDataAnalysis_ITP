		<content> THE TELEPHONE IS USEFUL BUT SOME-TIMES
 IT IS TAKEN FOR GRANTED.  IF PEOPLE   
 NEED TO CONTACT SOMBODY WHO LIVES     
 QUITE NEAR, THEY PICK UP THE PHONE    
 INSTEAD OF WALKING TO THEIR HOUSE.    
 THE RESULT IS A HIGH TELEPHONE BILL.  
 THERE SHOULD BE MORE PUBLIC PHONE     
 BOXES FOR PEOPLE WHO DO NOT KNOW THE  
 AREA.                                 
 THE C.B. IS GOOD FOR FARMS BECAUSE IN 
 THIS AREA OF LARGE FARMS AND ESTATES  
 THE C.B. IS A IDEAL MEANS OF          
 COMMUNICATION.                        
 THE POST IS FAIRLY RELIABLE, YOU CAN  
 POST A LETTER TO ANY WHERE IN THE     
 WORLD. FIRST CLASS IS ESPECIALLY      
 GOOD BECAUSE YOUR LETTER GETS TO      
 THE RECIPIENT WITHIN 24 HOURS.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
