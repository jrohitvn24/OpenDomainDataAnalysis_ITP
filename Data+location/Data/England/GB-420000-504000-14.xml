		<title>14Gala Day</title>
		<content> On the 18th July it was{Gala Day.}It  
 was a very wet morning and everyone   
 was hoping for better weather in the  
 afternoon.                            
 At about 1.00 p.m. I ran up the hill  
 to{Village Farm}so that I could get   
 into my costume and onto the Cub's    
 float which was going in procession   
 through the village to the field where
 the Gala was being held. When we      
 arrived at{Cow Park}the floats were   
 judged. The Brownies were first, the  
 Cubs and the Village School coming    
 joint second.                         
 The{Gala Queen}was{Gillian Pearson.}  
 The{South Durham Car Club}were there  
 and you could look at the cars. The   
{Army}gave rides in their{tanks.}The   
{Silver Band}played music whilst people
 spent money at the various stalls.    
 This event is{organised annually}by   
 the{Community Association.}           </content>
