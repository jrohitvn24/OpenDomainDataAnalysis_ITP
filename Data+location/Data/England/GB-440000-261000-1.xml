		<content>  The ancient market town of Southam   
 dominates this area of arable         
 farmland. Two main routes cross in    
 Southam: the north / south from       
 Coventry to Banbury, and the east /   
 west from Daventry to Warwick. An old 
 Welsh drover's road also passes       
 through Southam. Cattle from Wales    
 were driven along this road to Market 
 in London.                            
  The River Stowe flows from east to   
 west, joining the Itchen at {Stoney   
{Thorpe Hall.}The village of{Stockton  
 lies to the north east just off the   
 road to Rugby.                        
  There is piped water,gas and         
 electricity and a sewage treatment    
 plant. The chief industries are the   
 cement works to the north and         
 agriculture.                          
  Many buildings of historic interest  
 make Southam worthy of a visit.       </content>
