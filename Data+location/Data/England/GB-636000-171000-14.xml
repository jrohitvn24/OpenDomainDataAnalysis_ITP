		<content>    Skipping games for groups of       
 children are very popular. A long rope
 is turned by children whilst others in
 groups or in turn, jump in and skip.  
 In "French Skipping" a long piece of  
 elastic is used instead of a rope. Two
 children stand opposite each other    
 with the elastic around their ankles, 
 and another jumps in and out, or in   
 and on the elastic.                   
    In both kinds of skipping, rhymes  
 like these are chanted :-"Down in the 
 valley when the goats go push! ", "I  
 like coffee, I like tea, I like ----  
 in with me. I hate coffee, I hate tea,
 I hate ---- in with me." and " I'm a  
 little bumper car, number 48. I whizz 
 round the corner and slam on the      
 brakes. How many gallons did he lose? 
 5, 10, 15, etc."
