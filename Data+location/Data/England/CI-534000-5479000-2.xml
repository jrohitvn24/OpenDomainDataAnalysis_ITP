 Mayside Reclamation collects waste    
 paper which is then sent to England to
 paper mills to be recycled. This is   
 the only firm of it's kind in the     
 Channel Islands. They employ 4        
 people,the warehouse is rented and the
 machines are 2nd hand.There are 23    
 bins around the Island.The waste paper
 is cut into small pieces,then shredded
 and put into bales of half a ton.     
 There are 5 grades of paper.The card  
 board is sorted out and baled,and the 
 newsprint is separated and baled. One 
 fiftieth of the wastepaper is dumped  
 because it is full of rubbish. The    
 firm is situated in St.Sampson's as it
 is an industrial area,and it is away  
 from houses because of the risk of    
 fire and the{health hazard}caused by  
 rats, wild cats, and paper flying     
 around.                               </content>
