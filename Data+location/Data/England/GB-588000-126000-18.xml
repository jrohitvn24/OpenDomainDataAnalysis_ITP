		<title>18The Forge</title>
		<content>  The Forge was built about 1770 and   
 the Forge House used to be the whole  
 building next door which is now 3     
 cottages.  It is owned and run by Mr. 
 Stern who works there with 4 other    
 men.                                  
  The Forge makes 8 different sizes of 
 horseshoes and Mr. Stern mends spades 
 and lots of other tools.  There are   
 2 fireplaces where the metal is       
 heated until it is soft and workable, 
 5 different sorts of hammers and 7    
 anvils, 3 of which are for the 3      
 vans. There are lots of different     
 sizes of nails as well.               
  On average they shoe 8 horses a day  
 and horses usually need to be shod    
 every 4 weeks.  The charges are Â£22   
 for a Shire to be shod, Â£18 for a     
 horse and Â£16 for a pony.  Mr.Stern   
 sometimes goes out to shoe horses but 
 this costs more.                      </content>
