		<title>10A SCHOOLGIRL'S DAY p.m.</title>
		<content>    The afternoon session begins at    
 1.10pm with registration; a legal     
 requirement for schools. The lesson   
 after registration is Rural Science   
 which is generally a practical one and
 takes place in a laboratory. Afternoon
 break lasts 10 minutes, this prepares 
 us for our final 2 lessons.At 3.40pm  
 school finishes.                      
   I'm soon on my way home after a     
 brief wait for the bus in the school  
 yard. I'm looking forward to the disco
 tonight. Firstly I must feed,         
 excercise and brush the dogs then feed
 the rabbits. Next I collect the coal, 
 wood and charcoal and take them into  
 the house. When these chores are      
 completed I go for an evening jog to  
 Caistor. When I return I have my tea  
 and get ready for the disco. I will go
 to bed at 12.00 after enjoying the    
 disco!                                </content>
