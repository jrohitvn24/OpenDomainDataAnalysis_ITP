		<title>18WELDING AT CHILTON CANTELO.</title>
		<content> The firm of Adberweld is a crane hire 
 and welding business. They  own nine  
 cranes and each can lift a certain    
 weight. The smallest crane lifts a    
 load of 6 tonnes, 4 others lift 15    
 tonnes, 3 more lift 25 tonnes and the 
 biggest is capable of lifting 30      
 tonnes. To hire the smallest crane it 
 is Â£12 an hour. The sheds of the firm 
 used to be part of a farm. The steel  
 they weld with comes from firms in    
 Bristol and South Wales. Most of the  
 other materials used come from a      
 Yeovil firm. In one year they use     
 about 1500 tonnes of steel. When they 
 paint any metals they use red oxide   
 to prevent rusting. After this process
 the object can be painted any colour. 
  Mr. and Mrs. Giles run the firm and  
 employ 20 people. About 6 of these    
 work on building sites. The workers   
 have 26 days a year holiday.          </content>
