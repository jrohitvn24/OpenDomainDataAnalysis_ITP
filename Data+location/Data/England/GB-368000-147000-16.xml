{ 1st Coleford Scout group}consists of 
 cubs,  scouts,  brownies and  guides. 
 The subs are forty pence and the money
 from it goes to the scout hall fund.  
    At camp we study wildlife for our  
 arrow sceme.For{Summer Camp,}we are   
 going to the Brecon Beacons in Wales. 
 We go in sixes, Red, Blue, Yellow, and
 Green. The scout patrols are Tigers,  
 Cougars, Pumas, Jaguars, and          
 cheetas.Tigers won a three hundred    
 pounds trophy at the{Jamboree 1985    
 camp site. Some of the cubs are doing 
 their gardeners badge. We try to store
 our plants that we have planted. I    
 have planted some radishes, potatoes, 
 sprouts, and some spinach.            
   We have been saving money to be sent
 over for cub scouts in Swaziland.  We 
 have a  wide game, and we make flour  
 bombs.                                </content>
