		<title>02THE VILLAGE OF LANDRAKE</title>
		<content> Landrake is an old village that grew  
 up around the church.Today the village
 is cut into two parts by the A38 trunk
 road.All the amenities are on the     
 southern side-the{church,chapel,}pub, 
{shops}and{school.}It used to have many
 shops but since the building of the   
 Tamar Road Bridge in 1962 and better  
 roads,most people shop in nearby      
 Saltash or Plymouth.                  
 The 1980's saw the building of the    
 Highertown housing estate in Landrake.
 This enabled new families to move into
 the village,many of whom work in      
 Plymouth.                             
 Twenty years ago,the majority of      
 working adults of Landrake were       
 employed on the farms or quarries in  
 the area,but today,Landrake is another
 dormitory village.
