		<content> Class 2MW looked at half of our       
 given area(the primary  took the other
 half)The area is classed as an        
 educational priority area with an     
 attendant number of social            
 problems.Unemployment is {very high   
 and at a glance much of the area      
 seems to be run down.Vandalism is     
 rife.                                 
 Few social amenities exist except for 
 a number of public houses and a lovely
 park.(all looked at by the primary    
 school).My children are all in        
 school uniform and are very           
 clean,even though some of their       
 parents are out of work or earn a     
 tiny wage.To an "outsider"the area    
 seems depressing,but my class have a  
 wealth of talent and a great love     
 for their area.One thing that is      
 very clear---times in Middleton are   
 hard..                                </content>
