		<title>03FARMING - DAILY ROUTINE</title>
		<content> In summer Mr Phillips gets up at      
 7 o'clock and has breakfast first. Mrs
 Phillips, Michael and Christopher have
 breakfast a little later and set off  
 for school by car at 8.45pm. Mrs      
 Phillips is a teacher and on a        
  Thursday she would normally stay to  
 help at Morley school and then have a 
 piano lesson. She has no work to do on
 the farm.                             
 Mr Phillips will begin by feeding the 
 cows and calves. In summer most of his
 work is preparation for harvest. The  
 combine must be got ready and the bins
 cleaned to store the corn. He will    
 check that the crops are healthy and  
 stop for lunch at 12 noon. After lunch
 there will be hedgetrimming and       
 general tidying up to be done. After  
 school the boys help feed the calves  
 and tea is at 5 o'clock. The evening  
 might be spent pigeon scaring.        </content>
