		<title>17Claire - Panfield Princess</title>
		<content>      On 13th July 1985 I went to the  
{Panfield Community Centre.}My sister  
 Tara and I were entering the{Panfield 
{Princess Competition,}for girls under 
 16. About ten girls took part. The    
 judges were three American ladies.    
      We took part in a parade. I wore 
 a white, lace-trimmed dress which we  
 bought in{Chelmsford.}We were each    
 asked what we like doing best. Tara   
 and Lucy, my friend, were too shy to  
 say anything.                         
      I was very excited when the      
 judges chose me! A tiara was put on my
 head and many photographs were taken. 
      On 20th July I went to a football
 rally. I gave trophies to the winners.
 Each man kissed me _ I hated it! On   
 17th August I was officially crowned  
 by our{M.P., Tony Newton.}Lastly I    
 will take part in the{Braintree       
{Carnival}in 1986.                     </content>
