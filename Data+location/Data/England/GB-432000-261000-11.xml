		<content>  Our block is situated to the south to
 the south west of the Warwickshire    
 town of Royal Leamington Spa.It is    
 bordered by the village of Harbury to 
 the East,Bishops Tachbrook to the     
 South and Radford Semele to the       
 North.It is crossed to the South by   
 the main Birmingham-London            
 (Paddington) railway line and to the  
 North by the Grand Union Canal.       
  It is largely an agricultural area   
 with two residential squares which    
 contain an expanding residential area 
 known as Whitnash which at one stage  
 was an independent village two miles  
 to the South of Leamington Spa.It now 
 contains many new starter homes       
 occupied by young couples who work in 
 Leamington or Coventry.               
  There  are several farms in the block
 many of them having natural boundaries
 in the Fosse Way.                     </content>
