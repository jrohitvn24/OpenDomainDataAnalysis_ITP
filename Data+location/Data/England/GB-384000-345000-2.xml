		<content>In the market on a hot day there are   
lots of people about. The stalls sell  
things to eat or wear and stallholders 
shout the prices of the goods they are 
selling.In the market as well as the   
sights you can smell things like the   
food and leather goods.The market is a 
very busy and noisy place and there are
lots of cars about.There is a lot of   
rubbish on the floor even though there 
are litter bins about.                 
The guildhall is in the market and     
people can see what time it is by the  
guildhall clock.People are pushing and 
shoving and they are heavily laden with
goods.There is a man selling newspapers
 and pigeons are pecking at food on the
floor.On the bottom half of the market 
there are seats and trees shading them.
