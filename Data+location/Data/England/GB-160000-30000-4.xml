 The area has two County Primary       
 Schools, one at Crowntown and another 
 at Godolphin.                         
 Sithney C.P.School at Crowntown       
 provides education for just over sixty
 children, aged between 4 and 11 years.
 The School has a Headteacher and two  
 full_time teachers employed by the    
 County Council.  The School building  
 dates from 1912 although it has       
 recently been modernised.             
 Herland Cross C.P. School at Godolphin
 also provides education for just over 
 sixty children aged between 4 and 11  
 years and has a similar number of     
 staff to Sithney.  However, the       
 building dates from 1876 although     
 modernisations have been carried out.
