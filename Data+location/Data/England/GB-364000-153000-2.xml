 We found in our interview with        
 Mr C Flower that life in Norton       
 Radstock has changed a great deal.He  
 started work in the coal mines at the 
 age of 14_he is now 73.There were many
 mines in the area and he worked in the
 Old Mills Pit.There were 300 men down 
 his pit and they used 13 horses.Each  
 man had to supply his own tools.The   
 coal was brought to the surface in the
 cage and railways carried it to other 
 parts.Today all the pits have closed  
 and the railways stopped.Life down the
 mines was dark,smokey,dirty,wet and   
 dangerous.There were many accidents   
 and it was very hard work.Miners were 
 paid 11shillings and 3 pence(55p.)per 
 week but they had free coal.He thought
 that life was easier today but he     
 enjoyed his working days as a miner.
