		<content>    Farming in Thanet is a very        
intensive industry which results in up 
to three crops being raised in a year. 
These consist of wheat, barley,        
brassicas and root crops raised in     
rotational succession to make the      
best use of the fertile soil.          
    The farmland has been created by   
the drainage of wetland and then       
protected from marine inundation which 
had occurred several times in the      
past, notably in 1953 in recent years. 
There was also some salt impregnation  
about 1979 and the land took about six 
years to recover and come into         
production again.
