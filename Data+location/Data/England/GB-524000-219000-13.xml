		<content> There are two banks in Knebworth,     
 Barclays and Lloyds. Because Knebworth
 is only a village both banks are only 
 small branches and have a larger      
 branch in Stevenage. Both banks are   
 open during normal banking hours ie   
 9.30 am to 3.30 pm but do not have    
 cash dispensers for out of business   
 hours cash.                           
 There are also two Estate Agents in   
 the village, John James and David     
 Morris. Many people from the village  
 go to one of these Estate Agents when 
 they want to buy a house in the       
 village.                              
 There are two Building Society Agents,
 one for the Abbey National Building   
 Society and the other for the Halifax 
 Building Society. There are two       
 solicitors to complete the legal      
 aspects of house buying as well as    
 other legal matters.                  </content>
