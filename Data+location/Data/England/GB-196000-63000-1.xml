		<title>01ST.WENN :  A RURAL LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content>  St.Wenn is situated in a rural       
 landscape of{fields,woods and         
{streams.                              
  The rolling landscape is punctuated  
 by well cultivated valleys that are   
 mostly grass or rotated crops. Valley 
 bottoms are frequently very damp and  
 there are many small pockets of       
 woodland.                             
  Isolated{farms}lie at the ends of    
 long twisting lanes and the small     
 fields and frequent hegderows create a
 green checker-board scene.            
  Small communities,like{Withiel}and   
{St.Wenn}are build up around the{church
 and{school.}Some homes are owned by   
 Cornish folk and others by people who 
 have moved to the area.One or two have
 been converted into{holiday homes.    
  The farms are often owned by related 
 families and have been in the same    
 family for many generations.          </content>
