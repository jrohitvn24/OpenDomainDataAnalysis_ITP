		<title>05  INGESTRE STABLES.</title>
		<content>The stables were built in 1884 at a    
cost of a quarter of a million pounds  
and covered 5-6 acres.It was built for 
the Earl of Shrewsbury but; later      
when he left the oak and iron stables  
were ripped out.                       
      The new owner Tim Downs          
refurnished the stables and bought a   
further 150 acres elsewhere and later  
took on a new partner Rob Lovatt.      
      The stables provide a valuable   
farm of recreation which includes      
Treking and Riding Lessons.            
      The stables consist of fourty    
horses which are cared for by 5 full   
time workers who have living quarters. 
They also have 6 part time employees.  
    They have video cameras to watch   
foaling mares in case of difficulties; 
the mares dislike being openly watched.
