		<title>01The Edge of Breckland</title>
		<content> The land in this block is situated on 
 the southern edge of the Breckland, is
 slightly undulating and mainly sandy  
 and light in character. It includes   
 the main parts of the 2 typical rural 
 villages of Culford and West Stow     
 which have become virtually dormitory 
 villages for Bury St Edmunds and      
 Thetford since the reduction in labour
 requiremens for farming in the area.  
 Farming is mainly arable with a       
 tendency for the fields to be rather  
 large with the removal of a lot of the
 old hedgerows. The slow running and   
 non navigable River Lark traverses one
 corner of the area on its way to join 
 the River Ouse. The area also includes
 part of the 5,500 acre Kings Forest   
 planted to commemorate the Jubilee of 
 the King George V which also provides 
 an easy accessible recreation area for
 the residents of Bury St Edmunds.     </content>
