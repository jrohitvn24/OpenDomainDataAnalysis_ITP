		<content>         ST. MARY'S CHURCH.            
 Every pew in St. Mary's church is     
 differently carved.The oak wood comes 
 from Earl Cowper's estate in          
 Panshanger.In Germany there is a place
 called Oberammagau.That is where the  
 pews were carved.The pews are         
 beautifully carved.Leaning on the pews
 are two poles for the church wardens  
 to use.If somebody did something wrong
 they could go to the sanctuary.Then   
 they would be safe,but only for a year
 and a day.The sanctuary rails are made
 of alabaster.The front is also made of
 alabaster.The oldest part of the      
 church is the chansel which is about  
 700 years old.It is true that the last
 person convicted of being a witch was 
 buried in the churchyard.Jane came    
 from Walkern in Welwyn.No one can find
 Jane Wenham because she had no head   
 stone.She wasn't given a head stone...</content>
