		<content> Since this area is predominently rural
 there is very little industry.The     
 largest employer in the area is       
 Whitbred and Company, who own Castle  
 Eden brewery.This brewery was founded 
 in 1826 by John Nimmo,the land being  
 leased from the Burdon family.Castle  
 Eden burn was said to supply          
 particulary good water! since in 1826 
 the brewery has changed hands and been
 improved several times,and at present 
 employs about 250 people.Other        
 industry in the area consists of      
 Watsons Windows in Wingate and small  
 concerns such as Castle Eden eggs with
 connections with agriculture and      
 farming.
