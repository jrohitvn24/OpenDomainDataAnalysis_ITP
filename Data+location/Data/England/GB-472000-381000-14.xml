{CHESTERFIELD CANAL.                   
{THE LOCK.                             
 The lock's proper name is{Whit Sunday 
{Pie }Lock.It was planned and surveyed 
 in 1769,it was finished in 1777.James 
 Brindley designed it, but he did not  
 live to see it finished.              
 The Chesterfield Canal is 46 miles    
 long,it has 65 locks and 2 tunnels,but
 the length of the canal in our survey 
 area is only 1800m.The tow path is    
 still used by fishermen and people on 
 nature walks.The canal is used by     
 narrow boats,some of which have been  
 restored.Some narrow boats take       
 parties for trips on the canal.
