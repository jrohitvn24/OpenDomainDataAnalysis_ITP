		<content> Various schemes were proposed for the 
 line to become a permanent freight    
 route avoiding London, although most  
 of these proposals concentrated on the
 line west of Sandy. The steam         
 locomotives were replaced by diesel   
 multiple unit trains but traffic did  
 not increase sufficiently and the     
 whole line was put down for closure   
 during the mid-1960's. After much     
 discussion, only the section from     
 Goldington Power Station east of      
 Bedford to Cambridge was closed       
 completely and this took place in     
 1967.                                 
 Although the G.N.R. and L.N.W.R.      
 stations were built alongside each    
 other, there was insufficient         
 cooperation and connections were poor.
 Thus, a chance to increase trade was  
 lost.
