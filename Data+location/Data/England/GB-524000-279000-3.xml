		<title>03Ecology of the Raveley area</title>
		<content>  The area is mainly arable farmland.  
 Moorend Wood, Great Raveley is an     
 ancient ash oak woodland with invasive
 Elm which has largely been killed by  
 Dutch Elm Disease.  It is owned and   
 managed by the Beds and Hunts Trust   
 for Wildlife, a conservation group who
 open it to the public once a year.  It
 is the only Northern Cambridgeshire   
 site of wood speedwell (Veronica      
 Montana) which is found growing along 
 the rides and the spindle tree        
 (Euonymus Europeus) is also found.  An
 old moat is inhabitied by grass snakes
 and wild fowl.  The wood was surveyed 
 by Oliver Rackham and the survey card 
 is illustrated in his book 'Ancient   
 Woodland'.                            
 Footpaths link the villages within the
 area.  There is little polution.
