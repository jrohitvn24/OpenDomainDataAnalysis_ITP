		<title>01OUR AREA</title>
		<content> Our area is in countryside which is   
 fairly typical of Lincolnshire as a   
 county. Most of the land around us is 
 flat, and is therefore ideal for      
 farming. The main type of farming     
 which occurs in our area is arable.   
 Many different crops are grown,       
 ranging from barley to sugar beet.    
 Because the land is flat the area is  
 also highly suitable for use as an air
 field. Our area contains a large part 
 of R.A.F. Cranwell, which is a Royal  
 Air Force base used to train future   
 officers and pilots.                  
 The village of Cranwell is also       
 included in our area, it is a         
 moderately sized village, with both   
 modern and older housing.
