		<title>17HOUSES AND BUILDINGS</title>
		<content> In our area there are a variety of    
 different buildings. A lot of the area
 is farmland and there are different   
 sizes of farms. In the villages of    
 Bilton, Sproatley,Thirtleby and Wyton 
 there are different sorts of houses.  
 Most of these houses are semi-detached
 bungalows.Some of them are cottages.  
 In our area there is a new village    
 hall in Bilton, and there is a village
 institute in Sproatley. The houses all
 have gardens.                         
 There are two pubs in this area.There 
 are no factories around here. There is
 a church in Sproatley and chapels in  
 Bilton and Wyton.  Also there are no  
 main offices or big stores in the area
 we had to study for the Project.
