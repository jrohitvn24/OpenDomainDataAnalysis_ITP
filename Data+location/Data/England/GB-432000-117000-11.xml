		<title>11FLOWERS:SHELLEY NURSERY</title>
		<content>  The only flowers grown in the        
 glasshouse at Shelley Nursery,Wigley  
 are chrysanthemums,which start life as
 cuttings fro the Canary Islands.Every 
 week,pots of 5 cuttings each are put  
 under polythene for 5 days to root.   
 These young plants are watered by     
 overhead spray jets.                  
  After a week the pots are put on     
 metal troughs and moved onto the      
 travelling bench system.This allows   
 the troughs to receive automatic      
 watering and to be moved along every  
 week for 10 to 12 weeks,when they are 
 ready for sale.During this time the   
 main buds and any side shoots are     
 pinched out to allow the side buds to 
 develop.Then the plants are put into  
 polythene sleeves and packed 6 in a   
 box for sale.There is thus a supply of
 plants for continuous all year sale.
