		<content> Mullion is an ideal centre for a      
 family summer holiday. There is ample 
 and varied accommodation such as large
 hotels, converted farm buildings and  
 private homes of local people. Camp   
 sites and caravan sites are also      
 available. There are sandy coves for  
 swimming, surfing and sunbathing, with
 safe areas for young children to enjoy
 themselves. The South Cornwall Coastal
 Path offers spectacular walks and     
 views for the more energetic walker.  
 Places of interest outside the area of
 this block such as Kynance Cove,      
 Lizard Point, Mullion Cove and        
 Goonhilly Earth Station (a            
 telecommunications via satellite      
 station) are additional attractions.  
 Most visitors are in family groups and
 most stay for two weeks during July   
 and August, though a large proportion 
 stay for one week.                    </content>
