		<content>{Datchworth}is a village 8 km South    
 of Stevenage &amp; 11 km North of Hertford
 It has a population of 1500.The centre
 of the village is the crossroad at the
 junction of Watton Road and Bramfield 
 Road.The village green is an important
 local landmark. The{11th Century      
{Church}is also an important feature.  
 Datchworth is surrounded by a         
 mixture of farmland and coniferous    
 woodland. The housing in the village  
 is a blend of private and local       
 authority dwellings.There is very     
 little employment locally except on   
 surrounding farms. Most people commute
 to London or nearby towns.            
{Burnham Green and Tewin Wood}are small
 hamlets which lie along the Bramfield 
 Road leading to Hertford. The area is 
 mainly coniferous woodland punctured  
 by large private dwellings.
