		<content> Pheasants are reared to be shot in    
{Craggs Wood}and sporting rights can be
 bought.                               
  There is a relatively extensive      
 pleasure garden,including a maze      
 built by the present{Lord Eliot}and   
 each year a rock festival called{The  
{Elephant Fair}is held in the grounds. 
{The Estate}is haunted by a spectral   
 monk called"{Dando}"who walks the     
 grounds with a pack of ghostly hounds 
 although several people have heard and
 seen him the present{Lord Eliot}has   
 not witnessed either.                 
{Lord Eliot}claims that{Jesus Christ}  
 slept at the Monastery that preceded  
 the house.Legend says that{Joseph}of  
 Aramehthea came to{Cornwall}in search 
 of tin.If{Joseph}did go to{Glastonbury
 he would have stopped at{St Germans}. 
 If{Jesus}was{Josephs}runaround as was 
 the custom he would have slept there. </content>
