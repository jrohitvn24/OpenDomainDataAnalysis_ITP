		<content>{Pengelly Centre}is the only cave      
 centre in Buckfastleigh.When we       
 visited it we saw{Reeds Cave.Reeds    
{Cave}is a roomy cave which has a small
 door in the roof leading to another   
 cave.Mr Joint our guide told us about 
 the invertebrates.Most of them are    
 microscopic.There are the{flatworms   
 which only live in the damp places as 
 do the small{cave spiders}who spin    
 their webs in the cave.Bats also live 
 in the caves and they are mainly      
{Greater Horseshoe Bats.}The Bats go   
 into the caves for their winter       
 hibernation from October to April.    
{The Greater Horseshoe Bat}is          
 recognised by its horseshoe shaped    
 nose.The wingspan is 30 to 35cm wide. 
 In flight the{Greater Horseshoe Bat}is
 9cm long.The bats themselves are not  
 birds as you may think but warm       
 blooded mammals that can fly.         </content>
