		<title>15WILDEN CHURCH CHOIR.</title>
		<content> Monday evening, and time once more to 
 practice for the coming wedding and   
 Garden Party. We meet at a member's   
 house rather than in church. It's more
 sociable, making it possible to down a
 sherry at the half way mark. We call  
 ourselves the 'occasional' choir,     
 singing only on special occasions eg. 
 Xmas, Easter, Harvest, weddings etc.  
 We don't boast any outstanding        
 voices, but we're enthusiastic, and   
 definitely improving. Our roars of    
 laughter-the result of our efforts-   
 are often heard echoing through the   
 village.                              
 The deep bass voice of our choirmaster
 -solicitor husband of our headmistress
 -can be heard balancing the large     
 number of soprano voices. Our ages    
 range from 10 years to over 80        
 years. How's that for bridging the    
 generation gap!                       </content>
