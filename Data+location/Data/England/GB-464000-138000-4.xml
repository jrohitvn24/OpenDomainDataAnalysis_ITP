 The Rector has been a Rector for three
 years since June 9, 1982.He likes it  
 very much.Sometimes it is easy        
 sometimes not.The Rector keeps        
 bees,sheep and he  likes making things
 out of wood for his hobby he likes    
 reading science fiction and thrillers 
 and  adventure books.The Rector was   
 curate before he was Rector. If he    
 had the chance of being any thing else
 he would still be in computers.
