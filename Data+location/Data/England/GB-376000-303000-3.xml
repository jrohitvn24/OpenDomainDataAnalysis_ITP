		<title>03COSFORD BRIDGE PUMPING WORKS</title>
		<content> This pumping station is now owned by  
 the S.T.W.A. and is situated at the   
 junction of Neachley and Albrighton   
 Brooks.It was privately built in two  
 halves to serve Wolverhampton Corpor- 
 ation.The first half was built in 1857
 and the remainder in 1889.It was steam
 driven originally but is now powered  
 by electric.                          
   The pumping station is situated     
 above a 100' thick layer of New Red   
 Sandstone which holds the water acting
 as an aquifier.It is supplied by the  
 two brooks and 45 springs.Boreholes   
 16' across and 155' deep have been    
 sunk.Some 20 million gallons of water 
 is taken every 24 hours from the river
 and boreholes and supplies nearly half
 of Wolverhamptons water requirements. 
   Originally geologists thought that  
 the water supply would never run dry  
 but this is no longer the case.       </content>
