It was very difficult trying to get    
accurate statistics from a class of    
four  to five year old boys and        
girls.We discussed the kinds of        
activities they take part in under     
these three headings:-Inside the       
home.Outside the home.In the           
playground.There are eighteen children 
involved.                              
In the playground.Running              
races,catching games,hopscotch,playing 
with toy cars or similar small         
toys.These CAR games often took the    
identity from a television             
programme,for example Knight           
Rider and Street Hawk.Mums and Dads,I  
sent a letter,the children also made up
their own games..                      
I sent a letter. Children stand in a   
circle.One child drops an object       
another child tries to catch the first.</content>
