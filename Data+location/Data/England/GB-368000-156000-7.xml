		<content> An elderly resident of Camerton       
 recalls her schooldays when the       
 village school was the only one       
 attended from 5-13. On leaving, boys  
 took up farmwork or mining, girls     
 service at Camerton Court. There were 
 three classrooms each heated with a   
 fire at one end. It was often so cold 
 that pupils warmed their hands on hot 
 baked potatoes brought for their      
 lunch. The annual treat for the       
 children was a visit to Camerton Court
 they would roll down the banks, run   
 races and eagerly consume cakes and   
 drinks, filling their aprons and      
 pockets for the rest of their         
 families.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
