		<content> The{Grand Union Canal}is now          
 filling up with rainwater since it was
 drained in the early 1960's.The canal 
 is teeming with{wildlife.             
   No fish were visible, but there were
 a lot of{insects.}These included:     
 Flies, pondskaters and diving beetles.
   By the{River Ouse,}there are water  
 level posts and also next to the river
 there are beech trees and a lot of    
 wildlife.There are bullrushes near    
 the banks of the river and lillypads  
 are floating on top.The river bed is  
 mainly sand with reeds and weeds under
 the surface of the water.
