		<content>   This year sees the centenary of St  
 Mary's Church in Ash Vale. The        
 original corrugated iron church was   
 dedicated on the Eve of the           
 Annunciation l885.                    
   The present brick building was      
 designed by A.J. Stedman and the      
 foundation stone was laid on May the  
 9th, 1906 by the Hon. H. Cubitt, the  
 Lord Lieutenant of Surrey and it was  
 dedicated by the Bishop of Winchester.
   The bricks for the new church were  
 transported by barges on the canal.   
   The new church was opened and       
 dedicated by the Bishop of Dorking on 
 the 24th of November 1906.
