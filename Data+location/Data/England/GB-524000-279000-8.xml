		<content> The area around the villages of Great 
 and Little Raveley and Wistow border  
 on the edge of the fens and the       
 English spoken has an East Anglian    
 dialect, originated from Anglo Saxon  
 with variations provided by the Danes 
 and the Flemish.  Phrases sometimes   
 heard are 'I've never been so fite in 
 all me life' and one can often be     
 referred to as 'me duck'.  The use of 
 'bootiful' instead of beautiful is    
 very common.  'Newcomers' from London 
 have introduced Cockney dialects and  
 encouraged the dropping of the 'H'.   
 There is also a high proportion of    
 middle class families and the Royal   
 Air Force resulting in the use of the 
 'Queen's English'. American Air Force 
 Personnel in the area have added their
 own flavour to the language.  The area
 has, therefore, an interesting mix of 
 the best and worst of our language.   </content>
