		<content>FEATURES OF THE RELIEF                 
 The block is dominated by the flat    
flood plain of the River Severn, here  
less than 10 metres above sea level.   
The river averages 70 metre wide here  
and flows deceptively strongly between 
tree-lined banks. On either side of the
river are level meadows often with deep
pools of water behind the raised banks.
 To the Northeast the land rises gently
up to Sandhurst Hill (GR:838247). At 86
metres it is the highest point and from
it almost all the block is visible.    
 West of the river a long ridge drops  
steeply to the flood plain. More       
wooded, this just reaches 80 metres and
offers good views of the river and the 
country to the South and East.         
 Farms and orchards dominate, the whole
area is quite sparsely populated. Even 
Sandhurst village merges into its sur- 
roundings effectively.                 </content>
