		<title>12GROBY POST OFFICE.</title>
		<content>    My mum and dad own and run Groby   
 Post Office.The people who come in    
 range from small children to old age  
 pesioners.Generally children come in  
 for stamps and the older folk come for
 their pensions,to post letters and to 
 pay bills.Money of some sort is paid  
 out every day and includes family     
 allowance,disabled pension,sick pay   
 and unemployment benefit.People can   
 pay bills like gas,electricity and    
 water rates.As well as postage stamps 
 there are others for T.V.licences,    
 telephone bills and car tax which all 
 make it easier for people to pay.The  
 Post Office also offers the Girobank  
 service.The local firms come in with  
 parcels,letters and registered post.  
 There are six postmen/women but a van 
 delivers the parcels.After the Post   
 Office closes my dad does the books   
 and my mum does the pension tickets.  </content>
