		<content>   Industry in Wilton is               
 prosperous. There are industries such 
 as the{Wilton Agricultural Centre,}the
{felt mill}and the world famous{Royal  
{Wilton Carpet Factory.                
   The carpet factory was built in the 
 year 1650 and has been in continuous  
 use ever since. Youghal company now   
 owns the factory. Two types of carpet 
 are produced;Axminster and Wilton. The
 carpets are exported to the Middle    
 East, U.S.A.,Europe and Scandinavia.  
 At this time France is the best       
 market.                               
   Some two million square metres of   
 carpet are produced in a year. Sales  
 are lower at this time and workers    
 have been made redundant. There are   
 thirty six head weavers.              
   Carpet seconds are sold in the      
 Weavers Shop and there is a museum of 
 Wilton carpet making.                 </content>
