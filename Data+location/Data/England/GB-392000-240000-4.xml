		<content> My dad told me we have approximately  
 40 acres of grass ,which makes one    
 hundred tonnes of hay, which is mainly
 sold in Wales for cattle and sheep    
 feed. Dad also grows arable crops,    
 there are 41 acres of wheat and 10    
 acres of field beans. Wheat seed is   
 planted in October at 75 kilos per    
 acre. It is harvested in late August, 
 with an average yield of 2.5 tonnes   
 per acre. If the moisture content is  
 16% or less, it may be stored until   
 the following July. Most varities of  
 wheat are sold for animal feed. Field 
 beans are planted in late October at  
 100 kilos per acre. They are harvested
 in September at an average of 1.5     
 tonnes per acre. They are sold as a   
 high protein mix for animal feeds.    
 We also work as Agricultural          
 Contractors, which consists of working
 tractors and machinery on other farms.</content>
