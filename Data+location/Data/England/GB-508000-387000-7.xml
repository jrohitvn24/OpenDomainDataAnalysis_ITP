		<content> The main schools in the town are the  
 Primary School(CE) and the De Aston   
 Comprehensive. The Primary school     
 occupies the site of the former       
 Secondary Modern school, built in 1937
 which amalgamated with the Grammar    
 School in 1974.The old Primary School 
 building was one of the oldest in use 
 in Lincs. The Primary School          
 hall was the Wesleyan Day School      
 before the newer buildings were added 
 in 1937. The number on roll at the    
 Primary School at present is 250 with 
 a staff of 9 teachers. At 11 the      
 children transfer to the comprehensive
 which has a roll of 1000 with 60+     
 staff. Each of these schools enjoy a  
 fine site with large sports areas,    
 including a small outdoor swimming    
 pool.There is also a Private School   
 which caters for children             
 3-11(Sheffield Manor).                </content>
