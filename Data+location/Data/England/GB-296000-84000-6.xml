		<content>This is a picturesque estuary village  
and old fishing port.It appeared in the
Domesday Book as Leustona and is of    
Anglo-Saxon origin.When there were two 
settlements-a fishing one and farming  
one near the church.Trade with Holland 
and wealth acquired through wool is    
shown by some imposing houses and the  
use of Dutch bricks,originally ballast.
The village is now linear in shape     
running without a break from the shore 
to the A376 for about 1km.Post war     
growth has been to the north and south 
of the village road and it is now a    
thriving settlement with an active     
community life,railway linked to Exeter
large commuter population and          
attractive selection of buildings of   
varying styles and ages.
