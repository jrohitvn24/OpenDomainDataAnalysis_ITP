		<title>01AREA OF THE SURVEY</title>
		<content> The area of the 1985 survey is on the 
 edge of Telford New Town. The villages
 of Horsehay, Doseley, and Lawley, are 
 within the boundary of Telford. So is 
 the hamlet of New Works, but not the  
 hamlets of Coalmoor and Huntington.   
 Nor, more importantly, the village of 
 Little Wenlock, which had 618         
 residents in the 1981 census.         
 Including Little Wenlock, there are   
 about 1,500 residents in the area of  
 the 4 by 3 KM grid. Horsehay, Doseley,
 and Lawley are communities which were 
 nurtured on coal and iron. They were  
 products of the industrial revolution.
 Likewise the landscape, bounded by the
 Wrekin to the north and Buildwas power
 station to the south, despite its     
 rustic charms, reveals the scars of   
 that revolution. For geologically,    
 the area was rich in coal, iron, lime-
 stone, and clays. Ripe for exploiting.</content>
