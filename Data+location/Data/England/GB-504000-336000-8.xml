		<title>08THE FUTURE OF NEWTON.</title>
		<content> 2 of Newton homes are holiday ones    
 only and residents dread the thought  
 of further homes of this category as  
 they spell death to an already small  
 community.The resident newcomers have 
 rescued the village from the apathy   
 into which its depopulation and empty 
 buildings had made it sink.The village
 sees its future as a low-density rural
 residential area with a strong policy 
 of conserving its vernacular character
 of limestone and red pantiles for its 
 buildings and for having traditional  
 fences and hedges rather than         
 open-plan frontages.There is little   
 prospect of any small scale industry  
 and the only village employers are the
 pub and a video-maker whose local     
 employees are 2.
