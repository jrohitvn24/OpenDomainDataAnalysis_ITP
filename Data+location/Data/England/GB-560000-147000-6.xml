		<title>06Converted Oast (Problems)</title>
		<content>   Our garden is big and my dad has had
 to work hard in it clearing the land  
 to plant some grass and trees.        
   My dad has lots of problems in our  
 oast house making it warm and cosy    
 because of the draught.We have twenty 
 four radiators which cost a lot of    
 money.They are run by oil so we have a
 tank in the garden.                   
                                       
   Why is there a draught?             
                                       
  An oast house has a draught because  
 in the olden days they had a fire in  
 the base of the roundel to dry the    
 hops.To keep the fire going the       
 building was designed to create a     
 draught.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
