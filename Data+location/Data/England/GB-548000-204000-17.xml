		<content> There are 3 nurseries in North Weald. 
 The Art Nursery nearly covers 2 acres.
 Only 2 people work there. They have   
 all garden sundries and lots of       
 plants. It has been there for about 12
 years. Stacey's nursery down the road 
 is not open to the public. They have  
 one and a half acres or glass. They   
 only have one crop and that is        
 tomatoes. Opposite that is another    
 nursery which is on derelict land. Its
 nearly all close down apart from one  
 greenhouse. They also have a few      
 fields, one was grass, another corn   
 and wheat.
