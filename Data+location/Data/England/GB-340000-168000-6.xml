		<title>06Farming in South Clevedon.</title>
		<content> The Baker family own the largest farm 
 in South Clevedon. It covers 2OO acres
 altogether. The farm is mainly for {  
{beef and lamb }production with {6OO   
{ewes and lambs} and {8O head of       
{cattle.}Only 1O acres is used for     
 growing corn for winter fodder. The   
 biggest major influence on farming    
 policy in recent years was the advent 
 of the {motorway.}Much of the original
 land and and the farmhouse was        
 bought by the Ministry of Transport.  
 The new farmhouse was built in 197O   
 but due to insufficient compensation  
 the farm was forced to change from    
 being 5O% dairy to 1OO% meat          
 producing. Evidence of the original   
 dairy can be seen, near our school, in
 the form of a derelict milking        
 parlour. The picture of farming in the
 area is one of{milk and meat}         
 production. Very few crops are grown. </content>
