		<content> Other than the small corner of the    
 block which is covered by part of     
 Sherborne,{agriculture}dominates the  
 area. For the most part the farming is
 a mixture of{dairy and arable.}       
 Most of the dairy herds here are      
{Friesian}although there is at least   
 one herd of{Guernsey}cattle. About a  
 quarter of the farmland here is used  
 for producing{silage}for feeding the  
 cattle when they are inside. Two and  
 sometimes three crops of silage are   
 taken a year, a smaller amount of     
{hay}is also made. When the cattle     
 are allowed out for grazing during the
 summer months, fields close to the    
 milking parlour have to be used. Milk 
 awaiting{collection}is stored in      
 refrigerated tanks at the farms. Milk 
 tankers collect from the farms daily. 
 Farms cut off in winter store milk in 
 large trailer-size plastic containers.</content>
