		<title>06WALTHAMS CROSS</title>
		<content> Walthams Cross is a very old village  
 it is about 7OO years old. On the 24th
 June we went to see Mrs.Turner who    
 told us about Walthams Cross.Her house
 is about 6OO years old and the beams  
 still show the knots in the wood.     
 There are very few new houses there by
 helping the village to retain its     
 original character. Mrs. Turner has   
 lived in the village for 35 years.When
 she first moved there, there was a    
 chapel which has since been knocked   
 down. Many of the cottages, which are 
 now only one dwelling, were once      
 divided into two or three with        
 families of ten and twelve living in  
 each of them.                         
  Mrs. Turner moved to her cottage     
 because it was available at the time. 
 She was born in Great Bardfield and   
 married a man from Finchingfield.
