		<title>01Peak Dale _ An Overview</title>
		<content>  Peak Dale is an upland village       
 dominated by the limestone on which it
 stands.                               
  The limestone is a commodity much in 
 demand from industry as a whole.      
 Limestone and limestone products are  
 used in chemical and manufacturing    
 industries as well as in road and     
 house building.Consequently,limestone 
 is quarried extensively.              
  Near the village there are three     
 quarries.The one at Tunstead is just  
 south of the Peak Dale block,but as it
 has the longest working quarry face in
 Europe,it dominates the landscape.    
 Many of the people who live in the    
 village work at the quarry and some of
 them live in houses owned by the      
 company who control the quarry.       
  Other people who live in the village 
 work in Buxton,Chapel_en_le_Frith or  
 New Mills.                            </content>
