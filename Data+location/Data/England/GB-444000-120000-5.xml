 the book is held.                     
     On 31st March 1985 there were     
 60,044 books in stock but only 27,755 
 on the shelves. There were 1,461      
 talking and music cassettes and 610   
 maps. Probably 10,000 to 15,000 people
 use the library. There is more        
 non-fiction than fiction on the       
 shelves.                              
     You can do these things at the    
 library: work quietly at a desk,      
 borrow books or cassettes, learn a new
 language by lingua-phone, look at maps
 and find information from reference   
 books, look at daily and weekly       
 newspapers and magazines, refer to    
 back numbers of these, listen to the  
 half hour storytime for under fives   
 on Monday.W.V.S. workers drop off     
 books for the elderly or housebound.  </content>
