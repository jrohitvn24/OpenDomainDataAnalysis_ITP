		<title>08SMALL SHOPS IN RAMSGATE</title>
		<content>Although there are some large shops in 
the town centre, there are many small  
ones which offer a wide range of goods 
&amp; services.People tend to stick to     
their "usual" shops for certain items. 
Several shops sell fresh foods such as 
fruit,vegetables,cakes,bread and meat. 
Clothing and shoe shops are abundant , 
especially those selling ladies clothes
These "boutiques" have a fairly short  
life due to competition &amp; constant     
fashion changes.Premises close to the  
sea-front,in Harbour Street and York   
Street are usually cafes &amp; restaurants,
catering mainly for holidaymakers.Some 
public houses are found in this area.  
Shops selling boating equipment are    
near the Harbour. Addington Street is a
separate shopping centre.It once had a 
wide variety of shops but it now has   
several antique shops, 2 pubs,cafes &amp; a
few other shops including a haberdasher</content>
