		<content> The three villages of{Frogmore,       
{Sherford and Chillington}are in the   
 heart of{South Devon}known as         
{the South Hams}which are situated     
 between the {Rivers Avon and Dart. }  
 Traditionally, it is a farming area   
 with fertile land and a mild climate. 
 Until recently the land was used      
 mainly for sheep and dairying but     
 during the past few years the emphasis
 has changed to cereals and other      
 crops. {This disc}has been contributed
 by children from two schools. Those   
 from Chillington go to the Area       
 Primary School at Stokenham and those 
 from Frogmore and Sherford to the     
 small village school at West          
 Charleton. This is a very unspoilt,   
 beautiful and peaceful place in which 
 to live - still part of "England's    
 green and pleasant land".
