 In Ashford there are different things 
 to do.You go to school Monday to      
 Friday,9.00a.m. to 3.30p.m.There's a  
 playing field with a Rounders pitch, a
 Cricket pitch, a running track, Tennis
 court and swings.The school goes      
 swimming every Friday at Ludlow       
 swimming pool. Ashford is allright but
 it has its bad points as well as its  
 good points.For instance,cars drive   
 too fast through the village,there    
 is only a path on one side of the     
 road, and eventually the road comes to
 a dead end.The good things are the    
 school which is nice and does lots of 
 interesting things,the playing field  
 which might get new playing things,and
 there are lots of nice children to    
 play with.
