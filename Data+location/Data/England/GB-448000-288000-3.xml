  Along the main street in Claybrooke  
 Magna there were two timber yards and 
 many empty, almost derelict, houses,  
 but during the past six years many    
 changes have taken place.             
  The older houses in the village have 
 been tastefully renovated and a small 
 private housing estate has been       
 developed on the site of one of the   
 old timber yards. Claybrooke Parva    
 too has had some older houses         
 renovated to provide a pleasant corner
 opposite the church. These changes    
 have made vast improvements in both   
 villages.                             
  In Claybrooke Magna there are council
 houses in Woodland Ave. and a few in  
 Bell St. All other houses in both     
 villages are privately owned.
