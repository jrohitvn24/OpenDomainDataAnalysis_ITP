		<content> We visited the post-office/shop part  
 of Werrington Park Estate the post box
 was marked GEORGE REGINA it is 50 year
 old.It was a mill 80 years ago all    
 that is left is 4 grind stones showing
 dressing marks made by the mill owner,
 Mr.Pearn, his skill was not passed on 
 after he died.There were 3 sets of    
 stones and crusher the miller made his
 own cogs. The structure still exists, 
 the water wheel once used the         
 waters of the R.ATTERY,but no longer  
 exists.About 70 people visit the shop 
 each week,it sells no fresh foods     
 except eggs,also newspapers.Outside is
 a bus stop on the only main road in   
 this block,served by 3 bus            
 companies,Jennings,Frys and L.C.H.They
 provide public and school transport.We
 went over the oldest bridge in        
 Cornwall built in 1305.Mrs.Pearce had 
  a cannon ball from the river.        </content>
