AREA OF 300 SQUARE MILES AROUND STRAT- 
FORD.FOOT PATROLLING POLICEMEN ARE ONLY
SENT OUT INTO STRATFORD TOWN CENTRE TO 
DEAL WITH SHOP LIFTING AND TO PROVIDE  
THE TOWN WITH A SENSE OF SECURITY.     
 THE MOST SERIOUS RECENT CRIMES IN THIS
AREA SEEM TO BE BREAK-IN ROBBERIES.

CRIME COMMITTED EG.THEFT ARISING FROM  
UNATTENDED CARS AND HOTEL ROOMS.       
 MOST OF THE CAR ACCIDENTS IN THIS AREA
OCCUR ON THE CONGESTED EVESHAM ROAD AND
THERE ARE TRAFFIC PROBLEMS WHENEVER    
THERE IS A RACE AT STRATFORD RACECOURSE
 POLICEMEN FROM THE STRATFORD STATION  
HAVE BEEN CALLED OUT TO TREAT SICK     
PIGEONS AND FISH AND HAVE EVEN FED     
DUCKS TO PREVENT THEIR DEATHS DURING   
THE COLD WINTERS!
