		<content> In common with the majority residents 
 of Thorncombe are concerned with      
 maintaining a standard of living in   
 their comunity and look with          
 apprehenssion at the figures of       
 unemployment in the south west. They  
 take great interest in the education  
 of their children and their future    
 prospects.  Many people have moved    
 into the area for the rural way of    
 life and while welcoming improvements 
 in the amenities, are anxious that any
 large scale changes may interfere with
 the way of life they have sought for  
 themselves and their children.        
 Education is the responsibility of the
 Dorset County Council.  A village     
 school for 5-11+ year olds was built  
 the mid 70s after fire destroyed the  
 old church school.  Children over 11+ 
 continue their education in Lyme Regis
 and then on to the county colleges.   </content>
