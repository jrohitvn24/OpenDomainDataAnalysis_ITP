		<title>03ST. CHAD'S CHURCH, LONGFORD</title>
		<content>    Longford church is very ancient. It
 is about half a mile from the village 
 itself. It is called St. Chads. Part  
 of it is Norman.                      
    The font is Norman and there are   
 Norman pillars. At the beginning of   
 the 14th century the outer walls were 
 rebuilt. This made the aisles wider   
 and the chancel longer. The walls are 
 made out of stone.                    
    Longford church was repaired       
 in 1843, the cost was Â£11,000.        
    The church has two altars because  
 there is a chapel in the church.      
    The church has six bells which were
 made between 1721 and 1786. The bells 
 are rung before and after a service.  
    There is a tall cross in the       
 graveyard. The cross was restored in  
 1897.
