		<content> The earliest record of leisure        
 activity is the{Annual Fair}which was 
 established in{l234,}during           
 Henry VIII's reign. The Fair finally  
 petered out by the middle of the      
 l8OO's and was reintroduced after     
 World War I only to fade away again.  
 The weekly market, established in l234
 also became a livestock event but     
 ceased in l792.                       
 The squires were devoted to hunting,  
 fishing and shooting. Part of the Lord
 of the Manor's estate was run almost  
 to the exclusion of anything other    
 than the furtherance and pursuit of   
 sport.{Hambledon Hunt}occasionally    
 held their annual meeting at the      
 Golden Lion.                          
 'Club Day' was probably a May Day     
 celebration, with church in the       
 morning and tea was in the Golden     
 Lion. It was a day of celebration.    </content>
