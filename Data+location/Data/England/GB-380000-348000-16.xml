In our area we have youth clubs which  
are also used for such things as       
jumble sales where people can buy old  
things where they are cheap.           
Some children go to Guides, Brownies,  
Cubs or Scouts, which are groups of    
children which do an activity each time
they meet, such as swimming or football
or cooking.   The Brownies are little  
girls and when they are ten they go up 
to Guides.   The Cubs are little boys  
who go up to Scouts.                   
There is old-time dancing in the church
hall every Saturday and learners are   
welcome.                               
There is one library at the bottom of  
Chesterton where you may borrow a book 
or two for a few weeks.
