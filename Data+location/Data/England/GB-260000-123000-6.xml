		<content> THE GABLES-Guesthouse,Cafe and Shop   
 Gables is a pretty busy house in      
 Umberleigh, they have lots of         
 visitors. The owners who run the shop 
 came to Umberleigh a year ago and have
 worked in the shop since they came.   
 The cafe was rebuilt in 1984. The cafe
 has never been robbed so far. After   
 school lots of children come to buy   
 sweets. People come to stay from all  
 over the world. The cafe is just by   
 the River Taw which is very pleasant. 
 The owners enjoy living in a cafe. The
 guest house is open all day but the   
 cafe is open from 10am-6pm. The cafe  
 used to be a post office. There are   
 approx three guest bedrooms with a    
 sink in each and one main bedroom.
