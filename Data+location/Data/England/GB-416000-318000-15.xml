		<content>A typical Monday for me is to get up at
about 8 o'clock,get dressed and go down
stairs for breakfast which is usually  
Frosties,marmalade on toast and a cup  
of tea.I then clean my teeth with my   
red toothbrush and kiss my mum and the 
cat,Nippa,goodbye.I set off for school 
on my BMX TURBO bike.At school I play  
Bulldog with my friends before to the  
classroom.At dinnertime most children  
bring sandwiches or have a school meal 
but as my family are vegetarians I     
prefer to go home. After dinner my     
year,the 4th year Juniors,are split up 
into three groups for craft lessons of 
pottery,weaving and needlework.I am    
making a felt pencil case in needlework
After school I go home for tea which is
sometimes egg and chips.I then play    
with my friends either Snooker or on   
our bikes.Before going to bed at 8 pm I
watch "The Young Ones" on Television.  </content>
