		<content>  Boroughbridge has many roads the     
 newest is the Boroughbridge By-pass   
 (The A1) built in 1962   .The first   
 mail                                  
  coach from London came through on the
 16th October 1789.The Crown Hotel only
 one of several old coaching inns had  
 stabling for over 100 horses.But the  
 opening of the railway took most of   
 the trade away.Roads in the olden days
 were made of cobbles but roads today  
 are made of tarmac and need a lot of  
 maintaining.Soon after the Crown Hotel
 had had it's customers,four coaches   
 started passing through each day.They 
 often stopped for food and over night 
 accommodation and they were very      
 satisfied with the result.We have many
 roads today,all made of tarmac,from   
 tiny country lanes to huge four lane  
 motorways.
