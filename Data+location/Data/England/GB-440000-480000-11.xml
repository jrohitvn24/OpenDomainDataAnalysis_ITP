		<title>11Thirsk Singers</title>
		<content> Thirsk Singers have been around for 8 
 years. They used to be called Thirsk  
 Madrigal Group but they now sing a    
 much wider range of songs including   
 folk songs, Beatles songs, Vivaldi's  
 Gloria (accompanied by an orchestra)  
 and also songs composed by Mr.Wilson, 
 who is a member of the choir. There   
 are 2O members - 6 sopranos, 4        
 contraltos, 5 tenors and 5 bass.The   
 ladies wear red skirts and cream      
 blouses. Men wear dark suits. The     
 oldest member is now 75 years old     
 whilst the youngest is 25. They sing  
 all over the area. They have lately   
 sung at many public houses raising    
 money for Ethiopia. Sometimes         
 they sing at churches, chapels, local 
 halls such as Sutton Hall and soon    
 they will be singing at Fountains     
 Abbey in the autumn.{Claire Chapman
