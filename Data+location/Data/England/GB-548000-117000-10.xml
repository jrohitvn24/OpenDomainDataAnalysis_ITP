		<title>10Housing in Palehouse Common</title>
		<content> This is a quiet, rural area with about
 100 inhabitants. Most of the area     
 consists of the High Cross Estate but 
 there are a few privately owned       
 houses. The land is used chiefly for  
 grazing but some smallholders         
 cultivate their own land. About 25 of 
 the properties belonged originally to 
 the estate. Each house still bears the
 family crest and the word 'persevere'.
 Some residents whose spouses worked   
 for the owner still pay one pound a   
 week rent as set down in his          
 will. These buildings are brick with  
 tiled roofs with leaded lights or     
 wooden framed windows. Extensions have
 been made to many of the homes. The   
 peace and the slow lifestyle attract  
 people to the area and properties sell
 quickly. Prices are around Â£30,000 for
 a three bedroomed cottage.
