		<content> There wasn't any water inside the     
 houses.There were several pumps in the
 village so the water had to be        
 transported.Zinc baths were placed in 
 the front room for the family bathing.
  People used earth closets which were 
 holes dug in the ground.Each member of
 the family had his own toilet complete
 with a white wooden seat which was    
 scrubbed 2 or 3 times a week.Homes    
 were lit by paraffin lamps or candles.
 Mr Dearnley was one of the first to   
 put a chemical toilet in a house.Most 
 families grew their own vegetables    
 which were sown every year on Good    
 Friday.Each family kept hens and at   
 least 2 pigs for food for the year.   
 Children helped with the gardening and
 any other household duties.They played
 with whips and tops or sticks and     
 hoops.There were occasional village   
 dances for adults.                    </content>
