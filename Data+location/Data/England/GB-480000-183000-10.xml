{HURLEY.                               
  The Freebody family trace their      
 ancestors living in Hurley back to    
 1533.They employ 21 people in all as  
 they have 2 other boat building       
 workshops.                            
   They build only wooden boats        
 importing teak from Thailand or Burma 
 and mahogany from West Africa.They    
 also use English oak and pine.They    
 probably only build completely 2 boats
 a year though 300 on average come in  
 for repair.                           
 They unusually today,build boats      
 with steam engines.Their customers    
 include Americans,Italians and Swiss. 
   Freebody's pride themselves on the  
 craftsmanship of their work.
