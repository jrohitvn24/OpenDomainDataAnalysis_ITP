		<content> ANALYSIS OF FINDINGS.                 
   Following our survey,we reached the 
 following conclusions:                
                                       
 1. There were less 21-30 year-olds    
 than 0-10,11-20 and 31-40 year-olds in
 the village because the people in this
 age-group were just starting out on   
 their careers,and neither required nor
 could afford the kind of housing which
 Haslingfield offered.                 
                                       
 2. There were more 41-50 year-olds    
 than 51-60 and 61-70 year-olds because
 this age-group is at the peak of its  
 earning power,and can afford          
 Haslingfield house prices.            
                                       
                       (Continued).    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
