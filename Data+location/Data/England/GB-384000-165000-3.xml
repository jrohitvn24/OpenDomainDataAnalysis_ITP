 A community has existed here for      
 hundreds of years,no doubt having its 
 origins in Roman times.The first      
 recorded mention is in the year 1001  
 when{ATTENWRTH_AETTA's farm gives     
 indication that the land was settled  
 and farmed.                           
  A Roman road bisects the block and   
 numerous tracks lead off this.These no
 doubt served the Roman villa at blocks
 eastern extreme.The remains of the    
 villa have been excavated but as they 
 lie approx 6 inches below soil        
 level,they have been damaged over the 
 years.                                
  It has been estimated that the villa 
 had a population of around 120.       
 Various coins have been found in the  
 vicinity.The earliest dating from the 
 4th Century.
