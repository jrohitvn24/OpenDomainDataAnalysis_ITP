		<title>18EARLS BARTON-THE LAND.</title>
		<content>The village is surrounded by           
agricultural land which varies between 
clay soil and alluvial material.Beneath
lie beds of ironstone or meltwash      
gravel.Both commodities have been      
quarried extensively.The quarrying of  
iron ore led to the quarrying of silica
but this industry is finished.Evidence 
of the workings exists but the overhead
link to the old railway has gone.The   
land is being reclaimed from the old   
quarry for housing development.The     
remains of bridges from the narrow     
guage railway are visible; the semi-   
derelict land is a haven for           
butterflies and uncommon wild flowers. 
Gravel is quarried in vast quantities  
from the river valley and the resultant
lagoons fill the valley for several    
miles.
