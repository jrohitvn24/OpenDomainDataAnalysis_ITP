 Centre which is almost unique in its  
 service to the community.Opened in    
 1972,it is run by the N.H.S.32 people 
 work there and it has 15 rooms.There  
 is support from the social services   
 and the ambulance service.The nurses  
 and doctors each travel about 15O     
 miles a week.The 6 doctors form a     
 group practice and cover 12,OOO       
 patients.They also hold weekly        
 surgeries in 4 nearby villages.There  
 are baby and other specialist clinics,
 child guidance and a treatment room   
 for minor injuries,blood tests,E.C.Gs,
 injections and dressings.The general  
 health level here is good although the
 proportion of elderly people is above 
 the national average.There are 2 good 
 hospitals within 13 miles but waiting 
 lists are long.
