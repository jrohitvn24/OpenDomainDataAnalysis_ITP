		<title>01EFFINGHAM AND HORSLEY</title>
		<content>  The Effingham and Horsley areas are  
{heavily wooded commuter villages      
 serving London, Guildford and North   
 East Surrey. Both have thriving       
 communities with a good mix of age    
 groups. However due to the high cost  
 of{housing}this is not an area where  
 young people can settle.              
  There are excellent road and{rail}   
{links}with London and the South       
 Coast.The area has recently been made 
 even more accessible with the opening 
 of the{M25.}This may well have serious
 implications , some people are already
 leaving the area because it is        
 becoming too busy.                    
  As this is a rural area there are few
 facilities. Most people travel to     
 Guildford or Leatherhead for shopping 
 entertainment and leisure facilities.{
