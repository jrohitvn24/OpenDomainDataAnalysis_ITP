 On Friday Mrs. Blatcher came to talk  
to us about the {Chelsfield Village    
Players.}They have had that name for 50
years next summer so it is nearly their
half centinary.The Chelsfield Players  
are a group of people who put on plays 
together in the Village Hall.The group 
was formed in Chelsfield but not in    
the old Chelsfield Village as they     
first started to present plays in      
Chelsfield Park Estate.People in that  
area decided to perform plays and the  
group was formed in 1936.              
 Mrs Blatcher made a model of Queen    
Victoria for one of their plays, the   
model was made from clay.Mrs. Blatcher 
chooses the cast for the plays.The     
last play Mrs. Blatcher did was called 
{Murder In Company.}
