		<title>05THE BISCUIT STORE.</title>
		<content> This is the main industry in          
 Thorpe_on_the_Hill.It has only been   
 there for three years yet it is the   
 largest business there.The store has  
 biscuits,drinks and toys delivered and
 then the store distributes the stock  
 to various shops in Lincoln and the   
 surrounding area.The store does a     
 daily delivery but this does not make 
 the traffic too heavy.                
                   The biscuits are    
 delivered to the store by Foxes,a well
 known biscuit manufacturer.The Biscuit
 Store is not involved in the          
 production of the goods,only the      
 delivering.This business provides     
 various jobs for the people in the    
 community.
