		<title>04THE CARLISLE CANAL</title>
		<content>  Before the railways were built and   
 when the roads were in a shocking     
 state,Carlisle needed ports to keep it
 supplied with goods from other parts  
 of Britain and abroad.The old ports   
 for Carlisle were at Rockcliff,Sands- 
 field and Bowness.Mostly,the cargo was
 coal from West Cumberland and wheat.  
  The business people of Carlisle de-  
 cided to build a canal.This canal     
 would bring ships right into Carlisle.
 It was opened on March 12th 1823,and  
 cost nearly Â£90,000.It stretched for  
 11 miles,from Fisher's Cross&lt;renamed  
 Port Carlisle>through Burgh to the    
 canal basin in Carlisle&lt;behind United 
 Biscuits' factory>.Coal,timber,bricks,
 cotton and paper were imported for    
 Carlisle's factories,while passengers 
 could catch a boat to Liverpool from  
 Port Carlisle.However,the canal closed
 on August 1st 1854.                   </content>
