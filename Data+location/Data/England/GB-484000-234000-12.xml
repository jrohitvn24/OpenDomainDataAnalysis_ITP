		<content>   There are many games played in our  
 school playground including football, 
 line tig and rounders.I am going to   
 describe some of the ones you might   
 not know.                             
   The game elastics is where you have 
 a piece of elastic and two people hold
 it round their legs at different      
 heights, and other people have to jump
 in and out in lots of different ways. 
   Skipping is also very popular,some  
 people do Double Dutch where you have 
 two ropes which you spin inwards one  
 by one and a person has to try to skip
 with both ropes going at once.        
  Bulldog is another popular game;one  
 person is on and has to try to catch  
 the other children as they run from   
 one side of the playground to the     
 other.When you have been caught you   
 are on as well.
