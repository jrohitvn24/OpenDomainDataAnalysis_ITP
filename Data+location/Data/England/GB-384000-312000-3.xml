		<content>In 1680 there were 100 dwellings.Of    
these the following remain,Bedford     
Cottage,School Rd,.Heath Cottage,Long  
St,.The Mill House,Mill Lane,.Trevitt  
House,Long St, and Malthouse Farm.     
   The chapel known as The Zion Chapel 
was built in 1814 and the St,Mary's    
Church of England was dedicated in     
1857.The centre of the village is built
around a traffic island which used to  
be the old square.The houses in this   
area retain the old world charm.       
   Across Long Street the new houses   
start to  intermingle with the old     
houses.East and West of Marston Rd.can 
be seen the major new developments     
which have changed the character to    
some extent.As a result of this and    
further development the number of      
residences has increased to 557 with   
a population of approx 2000.
