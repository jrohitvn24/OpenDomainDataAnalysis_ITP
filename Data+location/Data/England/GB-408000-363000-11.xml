		<content>{Lane Head}                            
     Lane Head has two sets of houses. 
One lot are bungalows which are on the 
main road and were built about 15 years
ago.  Old people live in them so they  
do not have to climb stairs, which is  
much better for them.  The second lot  
of houses are about 9 years old and are
lived in by fairly young people.  They 
are behind the old people's bungalows. 
                                       
{New Factories}                        
     In Longnor there are two new      
factories which are two years old.     
One is called Paul Edens Clocks.  He   
went bankrupt but is now back in       
Longnor, but not in business.  The     
other factory is called Micro Plants.  
They sell plants, but not to the       
public.  They are doing quite well.    
Both of the factories have the same    
accommodation.                         </content>
