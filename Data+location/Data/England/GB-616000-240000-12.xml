		<content>The new Sainsbury Hypermarket under    
construction on Warren Heath beside the
A45(T) road is just outside the        
boundary of this survey area (only by  
100 metres), but permission to build   
has had a few important repercussions  
for the survey area.                   
  Warren Heath was the breeding ground 
for several butterflies, it will be    
interesting to see if the construction 
noise and then the completed workings, 
will affect this small but important   
insect.                                
  The residents of Bucklesham Road and 
Felixstowe Road complained that the    
value of their very expensive houses   
will fall.                             
  On both these counts we wait and see!
