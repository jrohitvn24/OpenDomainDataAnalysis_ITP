		<title>17GETTING READY FOR SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   I usually wake up at about 7 a.m. I 
 wash, dress, then go downstairs and   
 have my breakfast which consists of   
 cereals and a cup of coffee. I then go
 upstairs and brush my teeth in the    
 bathroom, after which I go and wake my
 mum and dad and my brother and sister 
 in their separate rooms. I usually    
 watch television between 7:45 and 8:20
 a.m. then at 8:25 a.m. I get ready for
 school and leave home at 8:35 a.m. I  
 arrive there, after walking, at       
 roughly 8:45 a.m. after stopping at   
 the shop to buy some crisps. I        
 immediately go and find my two best   
 friends; there is sometimes a game of 
 tag going on first thing in the       
 morning and almost everyone in the    
 junior part of the school joins in.   
 The bell for the beginning of school  
 is rung at 9 a.m. by one of the oldest
 children whose turn it is to do it.   </content>
