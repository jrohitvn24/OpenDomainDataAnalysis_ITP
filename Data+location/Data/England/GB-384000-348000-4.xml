		<content>    When we were taken to Pillar       
Engineering,we were taken around and   
given lots of interesting information..
We asked a lot of questions.We were    
told that the company made 300,000     
pounds a year,the youngest worker was  
18years old,and near to the Potters    
Holiday was the busiest time of the    
year.They have engineering stores all  
over the U.K.,and they are all in      
different named areas,for instance the 
one we visited is in the Midlands area.
The head office is in Leicester.They   
sell day today engineering requirements
like tools,spades,clothes etc.You do   
not need any O Levels to work there you
just have to be careful and you must   
know what you are doing.A worker gets  
the average wage of about sixty pounds 
a week.There are 15 staff and they are 
getting a computer to help them.
