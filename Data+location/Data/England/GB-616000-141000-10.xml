		<content>    Mr. Aspin was headmaster of Elham  
 School from 1959-1980. There were     
 three classes in the old school, two  
 in the main building and the infants  
 in the Sir John Williams Hall. The    
 dinners were eaten in the classrooms, 
 having been cooked in the old Police  
 House. The food was stored in the     
 'lock-up'. During snowy weather, two  
 boys collected the dinners on a       
 sledge. The new school was opened in  
 1970, by Mr. Haynes, the County       
 Education Officer. It consisted of the
 kitchen and the junior classes. The   
 Infant department was built in 1976.  
 The new school was the result of Mr.  
 Costain, the then M.P for Folkestone  
 asking Parliament when Elham's new    
 school was going to be built.         
 Parliament didn't even know where     
 Elham was, but promised to build      
 within the year which they did.       </content>
