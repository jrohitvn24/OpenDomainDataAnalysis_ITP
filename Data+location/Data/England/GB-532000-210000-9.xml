		<title>09Mc MULLEN'S BREWERY</title>
		<content> The first Mc Mullen trade mark was    
 designed in 1830.The firm owns well   
 over a hundred pubs in the county.The 
 greatest concentration is in          
 Hertford,the seat of the business.In  
 1836 the first pub was opened in      
 Bengeo,Hertford.The rapid growth meant
 that the brewery had to be moved to   
 larger premises in Mill Bridge,which  
 in turn became unable to cope with the
 demand.Then in 1891 ,the present      
 brewery,sited over two wells which    
 provide thosands of gallons of pure   
 water, was moved to Hartham           
 Lane,Hertford.Although the water      
 supply plays an important part in the 
 quality of the beer,the firm had to   
 keep up the latest technological      
 advantages.For many years re-equipment
 and expansion of production plant has 
 gone on.Major new buildings have been 
 erected.                              </content>
