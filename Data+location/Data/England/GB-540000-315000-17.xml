		<content>    In Tydd St. Giles there is  no     
 hospital or doctor's surgery.If you   
 need a doctor you go to Wisbech, Long 
 Sutton or Sutton Bridge. Mine is at   
 Wisbech.The North Cambs Hospital in   
 Wisbech is the nearest hospital. There
 is a new hospital called the Queen    
 Elizabeth Hospital in Kings Lynn.     
    The health visitor comes to school 
 twice a year.The health visitors come 
 to different schools.The name of our  
 health visitor is Mrs.Pallant.The     
 health visitor checks your eyes and   
 ears. The school doctor and the       
 dentist come to the school once a     
 year.                                 
    We don't have any chemist shops to 
 sell medicine but we do have a post   
 office which sells some kind of       
 tablets.                              
    Sometimes when people are having a 
 baby the doctors come to them.        </content>
