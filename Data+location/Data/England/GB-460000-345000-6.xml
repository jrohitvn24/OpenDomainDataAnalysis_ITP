 cars a week.Machinery includes 3      
 forklifts,1 crane which weighs 16 tons

 but flogged it.The most common car    
 they get is ford and the average money
 you get for a car is Â£25_Â£500 for a   
 fairly special one.Recently they have 
 formed a tyre centre and now sell and 
 fit remould tyres.PODDERS had a       
 lot of trouble acquiringthe land.     </content>
