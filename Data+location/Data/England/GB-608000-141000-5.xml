		<content>   Recently a fox cub was seen trotting
 across a road with a chicken leg in   
 its mouth.The fox cub was so surprised
 to have been seen that it dropped the 
 chicken leg.                          
   The best time to go fox watching is 
 in the evening.Some people do not just
 watch foxes however,as this area is   
 visited every year by the East Kent   
 Hunt!                                 
   Badgers are also plentiful in this  
 area and are fascinating to watch in  
 the evenings.The young are very       
 playful.                              
   There are many other animals,rabbits
 being plentiful,and also hares.       
   Many wild flowers can be seen;      
  orchids,cowslips,and many others     
  which bend in with the beautiful     
 countryside.
