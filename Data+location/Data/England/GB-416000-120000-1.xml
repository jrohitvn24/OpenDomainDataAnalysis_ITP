		<content>{Downton is a small village six miles  
{south of Salisbury. It got is name    
{from the Anglo-Saxons who called it   
{Dunton, the village by the hill.      
{Excavations have revealed a Roman     
{villa near Moot Lane, which was built 
{about 300 A.D. The Saxon Moot is one  
{of the interesting parts of Downton   
{with its legends of ghosts that are   
{supposed to haunt it at night. The    
{Borough is the main street in Downton 
{and there are several attractive      
{cottages and a cross. Downton had many
{cottage industuries in the Victorian  
{period , the main ones were basket and
{lace making which Downton was famous  
{for. Nowadays there is a tannery.     
{Every May bank holiday weekend Downton
{welcomes the Cuckoo. To celebrate this
{event a Cuckoo Fair is held.
