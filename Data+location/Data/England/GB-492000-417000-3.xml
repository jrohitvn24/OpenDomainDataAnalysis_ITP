		<title>03LAW AND ORDER IN WINTERTON</title>
		<content> Law and order in Winterton is looked  
 after by 2 policemen who live in the  
 village. Sometimes men from Barton    
 come in when the Winterton men are off
 duty or if there is too much to do. An
 ordinary day's work may include things
 such as investigating a burglary,     
 stopping drunk drivers, or any jobs   
 asked for by other forces. Minor      
 arrests for offences such as non      
 payment of fines have to be made.     
 There is not much crime in Winterton. 
 Our school has been burgled though. 6 
 bikes have been stolen this year      
 though some have been returned and a  
 few burglaries have been committed.   
 There is little vandalism except for a
 few people spraying paint or writing  
 on walls. Traffic problems caused a   
 policeman to see about a speed limit  
 on a country road not far from the    
 village.                              </content>
