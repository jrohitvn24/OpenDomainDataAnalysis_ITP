		<title>17WHITEHAVEN FISH CURING CO.</title>
		<content> Fish curing is a new harbour-based    
 industry.Clive Smitham,the proprietor,
 realised there were no fish-curers in 
 the area but there was a market.He    
 learned a lot from books and visited  
 factories in the N.East.He arranged   
 finance through his bank and bought   
 the old lifeboat station.This was     
 converted into a unit containing hot  
 and cold smoking rooms,a finning      
 machine,a vacuum-packing machine and  
 lots of freezers.Most of the fish are 
 bought locally in "kits"(10 stone)but 
 some come from Scotland and Ireland.  
   The main products are yellow        
 fillets, kippers,smoked salmon and    
 trout,and smoked eels.Kippers and     
 yellow fillet are salted and dyed in a
 secret mixture before smoking, using  
 woodchips.The fish are sold to local  
 supermarkets &amp; factory canteens.This  
 small factory employs six people.     </content>
