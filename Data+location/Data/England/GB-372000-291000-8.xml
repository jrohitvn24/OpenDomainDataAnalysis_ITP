		<title>08The River Severn</title>
		<content> In our area there is a landmark called
 the High Rock.If you stand on top of  
 this landmark you can see most of the 
 town.Opposite the High Rock runs the  
 River Severn,named after the Roman    
 Godess Sabnina.The Severn is the      
 fastest flowing and the longest river 
 in England,it makes it's way south    
 from it's small beginning in Wales to 
 the Bristol Channel and the sea. On   
 it's way it passes through Bridgnorth 
 dividing the town into two halves:the 
 High Town,perched on a sandstone      
 mound, and the Low Town,originally    
 a port area down in the valley.Today  
 the riverside is made beautiful,the   
 area around Severn Park being equipped
 for various games and sports, thus    
 making it a very popular picnic area. 
 On the other side of the A.442 Telford
 road lies the old town cemetery.
