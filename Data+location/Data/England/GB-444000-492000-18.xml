		<content> The local bus service is very limited 
 running only once every week (Mondays)
 to the market in Thirsk,7 miles away. 
 It was therefore not surprising that  
 we found only one household without a 
 car (there being no shops locally).15%
 of households had 3 cars,40% 2 cars &amp; 
 the remainder one.                    
 The Al9 dual carriageway runs to the  
 west of the area 2 miles from the     
 villages of Nether &amp; Over Silton      
 providing easy access to Teesside to  
 the North &amp; York to the South.Access  
 to the A19 is occasionally thwarted in
 the winter as snow ploughing &amp;        
 gritting are being reduced owing to   
 shortage of finance.                  
 A new shared Car Hire/Taxi Service is 
 proposed to run "on demand" to Thirsk 
 on Tuesday,Thursday &amp; Friday  mornings
 operated by the North Yorkshire County
 Council.                              </content>
