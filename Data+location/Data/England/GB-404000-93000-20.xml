		<title>20TOWN AND HEATHLAND BIRDS.</title>
		<content>   Talbot Heath is a paradise for birds
 because it's quiet and undisturbed. A 
 rarely seen bird is the kingfisher,   
 which is found near rivers and        
 streams. It flies like a flash of blue
 electricity. It eats minnows and      
 sticklebacks and it swoops on aquatic 
 insects.                              
   The skylark is common, it uses the  
 grasses around it to make a nest. In  
 summer it hovers, singing             
 continuously.                         
   Bullfinches prefer the dense foliage
 of woods and hedgerows where they     
 build their nests. They are fond      
 of bathing and splashing in pools,they
 sometimes sip from the clear water of 
 the Bourne stream.                    
   Also inhabiting the heath are many  
 magpies, they eat insects and eggs but
 are invading the town as builders     
 invade their territory.               </content>
