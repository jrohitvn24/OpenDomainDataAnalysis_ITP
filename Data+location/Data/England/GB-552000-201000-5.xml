		<title>05TOURISM IN ONGAR</title>
		<content>    In{11th}century Ongar there was a  
{motte and bailey castle,}but now only 
 the mound and the moat remain.        
{  Greensted church}is a great tourist 
 attraction,as it was built in 845 AD, 
 making it the oldest wooden church in 
 the world.Around{70,000}people visit  
 the church each year.Excluding the    
 English visitors,a high percentage of 
 the remaining are American and        
 Australian.                           
   The{Tolpuddle Martyrs}were sent to  
 Australia for swearing an illegal     
 oath.After many complaints the Martyrs
 were returned and given a farm in     
 Greensted called "New House".Two of   
 the Tolpuddle Martyrs are buried in   
 the cemetery at Greensted church, and 
 this is why the Australians visit the 
 church.
