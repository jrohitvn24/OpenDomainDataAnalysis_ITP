		<title>07Ascension Day Walk</title>
		<content> Following a Crowcombe tradition, after
  our {Ascension Day Service }in       
 Church the school and parents set out 
 for the annual {Hill Walk.}A convoy of
 cars left us at {Crowcombe Park Gate. 
{Then}we started to walk and we        
 followed {The Ridgeway Track}to{Hurley
{Beacon.}  Continuing  along a narrow  
 sheep path down{Somerton Combe ,we    
{came to the shady}boggy patch where we
 crossed the stream, sometimes getting 
 our feet wet.                         
 In{Hodders Combe}Mrs Bendon was       
 waiting with our packed lunch. After  
 eating we paddled in the stream       
 and played Hunt the Beanbag and the   
 Ball. We then had a Scavenger Hunt    
 under the trees and climbed up the    
 banks beside the stream.Off to the    
{Bowling Green}at{Holford}and then the 
 return car journey to {School.}It was 
 a great day out.                      </content>
