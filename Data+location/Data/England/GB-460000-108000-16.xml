		<title>16Village of North Boarhunt</title>
		<content>{North Boarhunt}before World War I was 
 a small village consisting of         
 lO houses whose inhabitants carried on
 market gardening. Between the wars the
 village prospered and expanded to     
 4O houses, depending on market        
 gardening. Nowadays there are         
 8O houses and the same activity       
 continues.                            
 North Boarhunt is made up of two      
 roads, the A333 and a side road. The  
 main building material is brick with  
 either slate or tile for the roof. The
 building along the main road tend to  
 be older than those along the side    
 road, which are larger and have often 
 been modernised. The majority of the  
 houses along the main road were built 
 between the wars, whereas those along 
 the side road tended to be built after
 the Second World War.
