		<title>09Two traditional industries.</title>
		<content>  The traditional industries of Great  
 Brickhill are mostly{lace-making}and  
{straw-plaiting.}These jobs were       
 carried out at home and mostly by     
 married women although the tenage     
 girls were trained in the skills and  
 helped their mothers. We have gained  
 most of our information from the      
 village census of 1861.               
                                       
                                       
 A{plaiter}is an old fashioned word for
 a plate.A straw plaiter is a girl or a
 woman's job. They made straw dolls and
 place mats.The most unusual ages for  
 straw plaiters in Great Brickhill was 
 10 years old and 64 years old. If     
 there were more than 44 straw plaiters
 they must have retired before the     
 1861 census.
