		<content>    Although a number of the field     
 hedges have disappeared in recent     
 years, to create larger fields to suit
 changing farming methods, hedges still
 form an integral part of the          
{landscape.}They usually contain a wide
{variety of plants}both in the hedge   
 itself and in the verge either side.  
 They are an important{habitat}for     
 wild-life.                            
    The hedges at the roadside are     
 usually growing above a grassy bank   
 which may conceal a low stone wall. In
 the summer months these banks become  
 very{overgrown}with cow-parsley making
 the minor roads appear even narrower  
 so that a car may brush against growth
 from both sides of the road.          
 Periodically the hedges are{trimmed}by
 a machine attached to a tractor.      
 Attempts are made to preserve         
{wild-flowers}growing in the verges.   </content>
