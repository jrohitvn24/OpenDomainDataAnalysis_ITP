		<title>20Health in Plympton</title>
		<content>   Some children from{Plympton St      
{Maurice Primary School}interviewed{Dr 
{Campbell.}He said that it would be    
 nice to have a hospital in Plympton.  
 Some people would go to hospital      
 because they have nobody to look after
 them. Others would go if they had     
 broken their arm, so they could have  
 an X-Ray. He suggested that the{Health
{Authority}would not allow a hospital  
 since we are so close to Plymouth.    
   He told us that the main diseases   
 children suffered from were tonsilitis
 and bronchitis. He saw a lot of sore  
 throats, tummy upsets and athletes    
 foot. Some children suffer from bed   
 wetting problems, or do not want to go
 to school. He said that there was     
 plenty to keep the doctors busy, but  
 luckily there are{antibiotics}to help 
 the fight against bugs.
