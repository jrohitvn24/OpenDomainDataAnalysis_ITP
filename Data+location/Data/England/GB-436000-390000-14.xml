		<content>{What would you like to be if you      
{weren't a boxer?                      
 I don't really know.  Probably a      
 footballer or a rugby player, but     
 definitely not a cricketer because I  
 hate cricket.                         
{Have you any hobbies?                 
 Yes, I am a matchbox collector and I  
 also like taking photographs.         
{Do you think that people will remember
{you in 100 years time?}               
 I hope so.  Yes, for the achievements 
 I've had already it will go down in   
 history because records are kept.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
 "Bomber" Graham was talking to pupils
