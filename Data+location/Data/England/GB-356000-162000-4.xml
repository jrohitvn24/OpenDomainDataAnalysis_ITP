		<content> The huge wood and cast iron wheel goes
 around if the sluice gates of the mill
 leat are opened.Its diameter is about 
 6 metres and has some of the paddles  
 missing.The wheel,considered to be    
 Victorian, ceased productive work in  
 grinding animal feed and flour in     
 1945.Between 1945 and 1961 the        
 wheel was used to drive the hoist but 
 now all the parts are worked          
 electrically. The mill looks to be a  
 rickety old building three storeys    
 high in which there are still cogs and
 old hoists.The top room was used for  
 storing grain to feed the hopper.     
 Marks on the wall indicate that       
 some rooms were only 5-6 feet high,   
 suggesting that people didn't often go
 in there.                             
 Nowadays the wheel hardly ever works  
 and the mill is used as a warehouse by
 the West Midland Farmers.             </content>
