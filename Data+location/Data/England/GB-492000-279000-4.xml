		<title>04  Life in Slipton (Part 2)</title>
		<content>                                       
  Most of the people who live here work
in Kettering and they travel by car.   
People shop in Kettering mostly -      
usually once per week. A bus travels to
Kettering at 07.50 each weekday and    
comes back through Slipton at 16.46. On
Saturdays the bus leaves for Kettering 
at 09.06 and comes back at 13.31.      
There is also one bus into Thrapston   
and back again on Tuesday morning.     
These are single decker pay-as-you     
enter buses owned mainly by United     
Counties. The children go to Cranford  
Primary School and travel by bus. At   
the age of 11 they go to secondary     
schools in Kettering. Very few children
live in Slipton.                       
  No changes have taken place in recent
years. There is a fete each year. There
is one public telephone box and one    
post box in the village.               </content>
