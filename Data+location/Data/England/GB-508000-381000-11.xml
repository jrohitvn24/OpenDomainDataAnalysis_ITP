		<title>11HOLTON AREA FARMING</title>
		<content> The range is from small holdings      
 providing partial income through to   
 units in excess of 1000 acres having  
 several employees who may or may not  
 be resident on the farm. Field size   
 ranges from small paddocks of 2-3     
 acres to large arable fields over 100 
 acres. The land is mostly clay 15-30  
 metres above sea level.               
 Arable crops predominate on the total 
 farm area. Wheat occupies 50%, barley 
 20%, sugar beet 8%, oil seed rape 8%, 
 grass 13%. The remaining 1% comprises 
 peas, potatoes, oats, beans,turnips &amp; 
 soft fruit.                           
 The only livestock of significance in 
 the area are sheep. There are no      
 longer any commercial dairy or pig    
 herds. Chickens are not kept on a     
 large scale but some turkeys are      
 reared for the Christmas market.
