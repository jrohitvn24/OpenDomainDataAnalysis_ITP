 then into a cold frame to harden off.

 local shops. Fertilizies and sprays   
 have to be brought.Chemicals to kill  
 bugs and slugs. People are keen on    
 gardening as they leave spare time.

 An allotment is a field in plots to   
 grow vegetables. There is piped water 
 for the plant.Each person has a strip 
 of land with different rows of        
 vegetables. They were having trouble  
 with weeds and badgers using it as a  
 toilet.Wind breaks are built to       
 protect plants.Growing plants is      
 fairly cheap.There seems to be a      
 growing intrest in flowers and        
 shrubs.Flymo mowers are               
 popular.Fertilizes are cow dung and   
 potash.There are many radio and t.v   
 programmes on gardening.              </content>
