		<content> The{Methodists}and the{Church of      
{England}members (the most predominant 
 groups in the area),are served by     
 ministers living in the locality,     
 whereas the{Roman Catholics}are served
 by  priests in Tavistock. In Latchley/
 Chilsworthy,Methodists attend services
 in the chapel in Chilsworthy,while    
 C.of E. members travel to the Parish  
 Church of St. Andrew,in Calstock.     
 Catholics travel either to Gunnislake 
 or Callington.The different churches  
 hold occasional inter-denominational  
 services to foster links.They also    
 combine to raise Christian Aid for the
 third world countries.The number of   
 baptisms seems to be decreasing but   
 church weddings remain very popular.  
 Burials are in local graveyards but   
 cremations take place in Plymouth,the 
 latter seems preferable to non-locals.
