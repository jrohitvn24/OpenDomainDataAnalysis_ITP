		<title>02HOME LIFE IN BRUNNION</title>
		<content>{ Mrs Croucher}lives in a small hamlet 
 of{Brunnion}which consists of six     
 dwellings.She is happy with her life  
 mainly because of the solitude        
 provided by the area.                 
  The{power}in her house comes to the  
 property from{overhead cables}and     
 constantly breaks down in winter.She  
 is changing her heating from{oil and  
{wood}burning back to{coal}because the 
 latter is cheaper.                    
  Her house was originally owned by a  
 farmer and used for rearing young     
 calves.It was sold by the farmer and  
 another low building added to form an 
{attractive bungalow}together with     
 three acres of grass which is cut by  
 the farmer for hay.                   
{ }Mrs Croucher  has a{car}which she   
 regards as essential as there are no  
 shops or{public transport}within      
 walking distance of her home.         </content>
