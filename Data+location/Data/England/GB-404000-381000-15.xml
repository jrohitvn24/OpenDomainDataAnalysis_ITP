		<title>15Building in Chinley</title>
		<content> Chinley is (or maybe was to you, who  
 are reading this in the far future) a 
 smallish village in the North of      
 England, roughly 15 miles from        
 Manchester.                           
 I find it very pleasant to live in    
 Chinley and I will stay here as long  
 as I can find a job in this area. At  
 this time (1985) there is a by-pass   
 being built and it has partly ruined  
 the landscape. Population is          
 approximatley 2500 and growing because
 of new housing. A majority of houses  
 are made of the local stone (Millstone
 Grit), which is a yellow-brown colour 
 but after five years turns a dark     
 grey-brown. But now they build in     
 concrete blocks, which are meant to   
 look like stone, but don't. Many of   
 the older houses are protected by law.
