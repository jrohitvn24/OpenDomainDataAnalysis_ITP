 farmer, Wendy Fearn has lived there   
 for 22 years. It is a{STOCK FARM:DAIRY
{AND BEEF CATTLE.}They have casual     
 labours, but nobody permanent. They do
 any odd jobs that need doing. The farm
 covers 100 acres.                     
      The machines are three tractors,a
 muckspreader and a bailer. Pictor Hall
 used to be a small cottage, and       
 gradually the number of buildings     
 increased.Behind the farm are stables,
 formerly used for{breeding cavalry    
{horses,}but now for cows. In winter   
 more problems occur because of snow.  
 But work finishes early because of the
{dark.In summer, the working day is    
{from 6am _11pm.                       
{     The hall and farm are both listed
{buildings.}At the moment they are in  
 the middle of building a slurry       
 tank.                                 </content>
