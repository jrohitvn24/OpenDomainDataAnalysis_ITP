		<title>10STUDLAND TRAFFIC PROBLEMS</title>
		<content> Studland Beach and Sandbanks receive  
 almost{1 million visitors}per         
 year,most arriving by car.During 1984 
 cars were turned back from the area   
 when parking became saturated.Roads   
 here are generally narrow,winding and 
 have many hills.Movement is made more 
 difficult on minor roads because of   
 slow-moving tractors,quarry trucks and
 caravans.The Sandbanks/Swanage road is
 the busiest.(Our survey noted 465 cars
 passing through Studland between      
 2-4pm on Sun.June 16th 1985.) Cycling 
 is enjoying a revival and occasionally
 organised clubs may be seen on the    
 roads as well as individuals and      
 couples.
