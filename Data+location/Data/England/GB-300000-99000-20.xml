		<content> Tiff Hetherington is one of the few   
 thatchers left in Devon. He learned   
 his trade as an apprentice. To thatch 
 a house he starts at the right and    
 works across in courses. The courses  
 are vertical strips made up of        
 horizontal strips called lones.He uses
 wheat and water reeds.                
 Sculpting is a very skilled           
 trade.First you make a drawing and    
 gradually build on your idea.This     
 takes time and is the hardest part.   
 Then you make a metal skeleton of your
 figure for support. Next you pack on  
 the clay.When you have made your      
 figure you cast it by putting plaster 
 onto the figure in two halves so that 
 you can take it off easily.Then you   
 fill that with plaster and get a hard 
 figure.You can use rubber but it's    
 expensive.Bronze or resin is used for 
 the final figure by Nicholas Dimbleby.</content>
