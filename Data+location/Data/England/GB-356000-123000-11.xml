  Mr Chapman now keeps beef cattle     
 which he buys and sells mostly at     
 Yeovil market. They are a             
 Hereford-Fresian cross. Artificial    
 inemination is used to avoid keeping a
 bull on the farm. There are 4 saanen  
 goats kept for milking. The frozen    
 milk is sold in local shops, not      
 needing to be pasteurised and keeping 
 for 6 weeks. 2 large white pigs are   
 kept, feeding mainly on scraps. These 
 are killed and the meat sold, though  
 some is kept for the family. Eggs are 
 supplied by 8 Golden Comet hens.      
 Visits from the vet are rare, as Mr   
 Chapman uses homeopathic remedies.    
 Help during the year comes from 3 dogs
