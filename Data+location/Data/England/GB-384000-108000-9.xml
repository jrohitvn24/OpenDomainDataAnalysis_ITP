		<title>09The old S&amp;D Railway</title>
		<content>  S&amp;D stands for 'Somerset and Dorset.'
 Most people travelled on the trains.  
 The colour of the trains was black and
 green.                                
  If you started at Stourpaine station 
 the next along the line would be      
 Blandford or Shillingstone. Some      
 people went to work there by train.   
  If you went somewhere you could stay 
 there until the next train you wanted 
 to catch came.                        
  People went to places like Temple-   
 combe or Bournemouth, but it was      
 called 'Somerset and Dorset' because  
 it ran through them all the way from  
 Highbridge and Bath to Bournemouth.   
  The railway stopped in 1966. Since   
 then the track has been taken up and  
 people go for walks along it.         
  Many older people still remember     
 crossing the field to catch the train 
 at 'Durweston and Stourpaine Halt.'   </content>
