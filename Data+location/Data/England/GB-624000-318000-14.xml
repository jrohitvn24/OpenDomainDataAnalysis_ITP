		<title>14A DAY IN ROSIE'S LIFE</title>
		<content> At seven thirty I crawled out of bed  
 to get ready for school, then realised
 it was Saturday. So I went to watch TV
 AM. At eight my dad came downstairs to
 cook breakfast. He doesn't like the TV
 on before nine- so breakfast instead. 
 At eleven I was dragged from the      
 screen to go riding at Buxton. When we
 got there we paid the fee and sorted  
 out riding hats to fit. The horse I   
 had was 'Freckles'. Sharon led the    
 horses into the riding area where we  
 started walking the horses round and  
 round. We started to trot, then       
 trotting without stirrups. I fell into
 the mud and water below. Home after   
 the lesson meant watching Grandstand  
 on the TV. I made tea, watched some   
 more telly then at ten dragged myself 
 to bed.                               
                                       
                                       </content>
