		<content> In the area of {Sholing,Merry Oak and 
{Itchen,}there are estates of {houses} 
 built in the early part of the 20th   
 century and between the two world     
 wars.They are mainly made of brick and
 are semi-detached or terraced.Some    
 were built by the council and some    
 were privately built.They have small  
 gardens with little or no room between
 the houses so that the owners today   
 have to leave their cars in the       
 streets.This is not very good because 
 the streets in some parts are not very
 wide. Recently,houses were pulled down
 when the Bitterne bypass was built.   
 There are {open spaces}in the area    
 such as {Freemantle Common,Peartree   
{Green}and the{Veracity Ground.
