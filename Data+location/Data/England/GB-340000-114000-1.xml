		<title>01D BLOCK GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content>{Our D block includes the villages of  
{South Petherton, Lopen, Over          
{Stratton, Seavington St Michael, and  
{part of Shepton Beauchamp. The area   
{is fairly flat with more hills        
{towards the south. Most of the land   
{is used for agriculture, and the      
{soil around South Petherton is        
{supposed to be the most productive    
{in the County. Farming is mainly      
{concerned with dairy cattle, but      
{there are also many orchards in the   
{block.                                
{South Petherton is the largest of     
{the villages, and has a reasonable    
{number of shops and services which    
{are used by the surrounding           
{population.                           
{The A303 trunk road bisects the       
{block taking traffic from the east, to
{and through the West Country.
