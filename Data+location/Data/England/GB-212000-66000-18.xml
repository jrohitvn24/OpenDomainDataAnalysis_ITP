		<content> There is{a bus from Mount to Plymouth.
 It leaves Mount at about 12 o'clock on
 Saturday. There is a bus from         
 Cardinham also going to Plymouth. It  
 goes around 10:15 and returns at 6:30 
 in the evening.The colour of the bus  
 is a sort of maroon and belongs to    
 Webbers.The scool bus goes from       
 Warleggan to Mount to Cardinham and   
 then to Bodmin at 8:15 and the colour 
 is blue.I have{to walk to school.     
 There are 3 people that walk to school
 because we all live in the            
 village.Most children in our school   
 use transport because they live in    
 other villages or on farms.26 children
 come by car, 18 come by bus, and 3    
 come by taxi.{People living in the    
{country need their own transport.
