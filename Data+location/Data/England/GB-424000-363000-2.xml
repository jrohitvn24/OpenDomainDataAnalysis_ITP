		<title>02Housing in Stanton-in-Peak</title>
		<content> Stanton, mentioned in the first       
 Domesday Survey, has benefitted from  
 the patronage of the families of      
 Stanton Hall, who in the l800s built  
 the Church, school, reading room and  
 many estate workers cottages from     
 locally quarried gritstone....        
 'Our house was once the butcher's     
 shop.In my garden I have dug up lots  
 of bones and teeth of sheep and cows. 
 The big gritstone salting slab from   
 the pantry, is now our garden seat.   
 The old apple loft is a bedroom...'   
 'My house, 'Brae Cottage' (1985) is   
 the newest house in Stanton. It had to
 be built of natural gritstone, have a 
 solid wooden front door, a low level  
 roof and windows of a certain size.   
 Outwardly it blends in perfectly with 
 the old houses and is very modern     
 inside. My dad,who is an architect,   
 designed it.'                         </content>
