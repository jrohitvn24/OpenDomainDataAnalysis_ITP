		<title>11HOVE'S AGEING POPULATION.</title>
		<content> Of Hove's 84,000 population in l984   
 some 34% were of retirement age.The   
 over 75's alone represented 12.6% and 
 26% of the households were single     
 pensioners living on their own.       
  This can partly be attributed to the 
 embracing and invigorating sea air, as
 well as the fine clean reputation Hove
 has s a resort.As a result of its high
 average age of residents and the      
 necessary wealth needed to survive in 
 such an affluent resort, Hove was     
 described by the Sunday Times in      
 February 1984 as being the 'safest    
 Conservative seat in the country,     
 comprised of middle-class, elderly    
 retired population.'
