		<title>13Brattle Farm Museum.</title>
		<content>   For many years,it seems, no-one at  
 Brattle Farm threw anything away. As  
 the farm grew older,so did the accum- 
 ulating collection of old vehicles and
 implements. They now form the basis of
 the Brattle Farm Museum.              
   On display are old tractors,vintage 
 cars together with old implements,    
 tools and 19th and early 20th century 
 bygones.                              
   The farm is,however,still a working 
 farm and the museum must be looked    
 after along with the pigs and cows.   
   Sadly,the museum suffered a serious 
 fire and has had to remain closed for 
 many months. Happilly,though rebuild- 
 ing work has progressed well and it   
 will soon be open to the public again.
