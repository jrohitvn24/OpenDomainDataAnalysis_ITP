		<title>07EMILY'S DAY IN WILLOUGHBY</title>
		<content>  After school I went to Widmerpool,   
 the next village, with Sally.Some of  
 the children in our school live in    
 Widmerpool and have to be brought by  
 car every day to Willoughby School.   
 When we got to Sally's house we       
 went to play with Kirsty for about an 
 hour.Then we had tea and after tea we 
 went to play witches with Kirsty,     
 Sally and Kelly. After that, Sally's  
 mum brought me home in the car. Then I
 watched T.V. until bedtime which was  
 9.30.p.m. Then I read until 10.00.p.m.
 when I got to sleep.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
