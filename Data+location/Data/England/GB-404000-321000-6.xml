		<content> The principle attraction to this area 
 is the Blithfield Resevoir.  This     
 brings tourists to participate in     
 sailing and fishing but mainly to     
 study the very many variety of birds  
 who either ihabit the reservoir or    
 rest there during migration.  visitors
 come all the year round, some of      
 course just to amire the beautiful    
 expanse of water in an attractive     
 rural setting.  At week-ends during   
 the summer visitors roam the lanes    
 which encircle the reservoir, even    
 ice-cream vans and hot-dog stands can 
 be seen.  At one time Blithfield Hall 
 was open to the public and may be     
 again in the near future.  Over night 
 accommodation is available at some    
 farm house, the farmer's wives provide
 bed and breakfast at reasonable       
 prices.  Their guests are often       
 visitors to Alton Tower &amp; Linchfield. </content>
