 THE AREA BEING SURVEYED IS A LOWLAND  
 AREA VERY CLOSE TO SEA LEVEL AND THIS 
 IS REFLECTED IN THE NATURE OF THE     
 AGRICULTURE. DUE TO THE LOW NATURE OF 
 THE LAND IT REQUIRES DRAINING IF IT IS
 TO BE USED FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN    
 PASTURE. THE MAJORITY OF THE AREA IS  
 USED FOR PASTURE IN PARTICULAR DAIRY  
 FARMING. IN ADDITION SOME AREAS ARE   
 USED FOR ARABLE PURPOSES, GENERALLY   
 WHEAT BUT ALSO BARLEY. CLOSE TO       
 HOCKLEY ITSELF THE LAND IS MAINLY     
 PASTURE SOME OF WHICH IS USED FOR     
 RIDING STABLES. IT IS NOT INTENSIVELY 
 USED AS THERE ARE SEVERAL PLANS FOR   
 FURTHER URBAN DEVELOPMENT IN THE AREA.
