		<title>08ICE HOUSES</title>
		<content>   The ice houses which served  Forcett
 and  Stanwick Halls  still remain. The
 one at Forcett is sited under an earth
 mound  now covered by trees and shrubs
 near  the  lake.  Its entrance is  via
 a tunnel at the base of the mound. The
 one  at  Stanwick  is  constructed  of
 natural stone with a slate roof and   
 has its entrance at ground level. The 
 storage chamber is down below ground. 
 Ice taken from the lake in each of    
 these country parks in Winter was used
 to preserve the fish and game etc.    
 caught or butchered on the estates and
 stored in these ice houses. Neither is
 now used, they are simply a part of   
 the heritage of the area as are the   
 remnants of the parklands.
