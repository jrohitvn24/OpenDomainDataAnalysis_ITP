		<content>{Have you any problems with housing?   
 Not really.Generally they are well    
 built,although some people have had   
 trouble with damp and condensation.   
 When houses are vacated they are left 
 boarded up and empty for too long,    
 which spoils the look of the area.    
 Small fences are needed around the    
 front lawns,and then the gardens could
 be made tidy and colourful.It would be
 pleasant to have more trees to soften 
 the look of the estate.               
                                       
{How good are the facilities for       
{children on the estate?               
 For the older children the Leisure    
 Centre and Adventure Playground are   
 great,but a Park would be useful,with 
 good,safe swings.There are not enough 
 Nursery School places available.Too   
 many children are allowed to hang     
 around the pub of an evening.{(contd) </content>
