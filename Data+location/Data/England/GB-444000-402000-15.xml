		<content> The Goldthorpe Tartaneers are         
{majorettes}with a difference because  
 we are majorettes and cheerleaders    
 combined to make one group. Beryl     
 Sanderson started the Tartaneers in   
 Dearneside Comprehensive School in    
{1980.} Now a committee is chosed by   
 popular vote. The Tartaneers train at 
 Goldthorpe Youth Club on Mondays and  
 Wednesdays, we used to train at       
 Goldthorpe Junior School. Our ages are
 between{4 and 16 years.}At first there
 were nearly 200 in the group, now     
 there are about{28 children.}Most of  
 our uniform is red and white tartan.  
 We name the displays is order,        
 pick-up, square,  star and spirals.   
 Pom-poms, glockenspeils, drums and    
 maces are used in displays at Garden  
 Parties, Carnivals, Processions and   
 Finningly Air display in Dearne area  
 and sometimes Doncaster or Barnsley.  </content>
