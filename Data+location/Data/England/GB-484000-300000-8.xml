		<content> There are three churches in the study 
 area _ St Mary the Virgin , Ayston ,  
 St Mary and Andrew , Ridlington , and 
 St Peter St Paul , Preston .These are 
 all described in Pevsner's (1984)     
 "Leicestershire and Rutland"  volume  
 of "The Buildings of England" series. 
 Another interesting reference is a    
 Victorian Albumn of watercolours and  
 drawings which describes these churhes
 as they were in the 1830's. This is   
 published by Barrowden Books London   
 (1983) and there is a copy in the     
 Uppingham School Library.The original 
 paintings and drawings are in the     
 archives of Uppingham School.         
    A bibliography of Leicestershire   
 churches, including newspaper sources,
 has been published by the Department  
 of Adult Education, University of     
 Leicester (1978, 1980).
