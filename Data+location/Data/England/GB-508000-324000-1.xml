		<title>01Haconby, The edge of the Fen</title>
		<content> The low hills in the west flatter out 
 into the true Lincolnshire Fens - from
 100 feet eleration at Stainfield down 
 to Haconby which is about 15 feet     
 above the sea.  Further east the      
 Fenland continues to the Wash.  The   
 land is fertile and intensivly farmed.
  Little natural ground cover exists in
 the east of the block as few hedgerows
 and trees remain.  although farming is
 the major industry and the villages   
 remain essentially local communities, 
 there is a growing number of small    
 business in such fields as designn,   
 computers and plumbing, and more      
 people are travelling to work outside 
 the area.  Morton in undergoing change
 as new private housing continues to be
 built.  The west part of the block is 
 mainly woods, pasture and low hills   
 which provide a good habitat for      
 wildlife.                             </content>
