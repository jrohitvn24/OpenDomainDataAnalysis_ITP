   The International 12 Square Metre   
Sharpie came to England in 1932.       
   Designed by Kroger and Brauer in    
1931 it was the winning design in the  
 competition organised by the Deutscher
 Segler Verband, the German Sailing    
Club, to find a two man centre board   
dinghy of high performance.  The desing
has proved to be amazingly robust -    
many top class boats are over 40 years 
old and yet still able to compete on   
even terms with newer boats.           
   The class was in its heyday in 1965,
when it was the two man dinghy at the  
Melbourne Olympics.  Jaspser Blackall, 
K63 - Chuckles, won the silver medal   
for Britain.                           
   In the past 15 years interest has   
revived and there are now 50 boats     
racing in the U.K with the largest     
fleet at Wells-next-the-sea.           </content>
