		<content>{St. Nicholas, Newtown,}is  Church of  
 England, 100 years old, and run by two
 priests, being one of three parishes  
 operated by a team ministry helped by 
 laity.  The congregation is drawn from
 the whole of the Newbury area, with   
 large attendances at Easter, Christmas
 etc..  16 baptisms, 7 weddings and 5  
 funerals were conducted last year.    
{Francis de Sales R.C. Church}is 150 to
 200 years old, its congregation drawn 
 from South West Newbury.  Groups      
 flourish in all age ranges, and lay   
 people assist in all activities.  Fund
 raising takes many forms; bazaars,    
 fetes, and collections all helping.   
 All the churches expect the different 
 denominations to draw closer together 
 in the future, and probably to provide
 facilities and a local focal point for
 people of all beliefs or none.
