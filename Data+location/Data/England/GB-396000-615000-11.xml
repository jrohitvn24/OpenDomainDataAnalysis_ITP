		<content> Although the area is quite remote, a  
 large number of tourists visit the    
 area in the summer. This often leads  
 to congestion on the narrow valley    
 road especially at Hartside Farm which
 marks the end of the council road.    
 Here all visitors must leave their    
 cars (and even buses) in a tiny       
 car-park. There are four things which 
 bring tourists to the area.           
    (a)the hills ,which are used by    
 many folk for walking and even skiing.
    (b)Linhope hamlet in its beautiful 
 setting.                              
    (c)Linhope Spout-located just out  
 of the area.                          
    (d)Brough-law ,with its Ancient    
 British Campsite.                     
      No jobs have arisen out of       
 tourism in this area. There is no     
 charge for any site in this area.
