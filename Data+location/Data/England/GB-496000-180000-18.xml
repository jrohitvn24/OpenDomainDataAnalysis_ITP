		<title>18HOUSING &amp; COMMUNITIES SLOUGH</title>
		<content>      Most people do find the areas    
 they live in friendly but they also   
 have complaints about the housing and 
 facilities.  In Manor Park they       
 complained about:                     
                                       
{age &amp; poor  state of repair of council
{                               housing
{poor facilities (outside toilet       
{                 bathroom off kitchen)
{cramped conditions - gardens not big  
{     enough, no garages between houses
{lack of social facilities, especially 
{          for the young &amp; the elderly.
                                       
      Although most people like their  
 neighbours, problems  do occur.  Older
 folk find noise from young children   
 difficult.  It is not easy to get to  
 know someone from a different culture.
