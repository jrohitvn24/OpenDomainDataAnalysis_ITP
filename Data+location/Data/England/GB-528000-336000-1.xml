		<content> Kirton is a large village with a      
 population of approximately 7,000     
 people. It is situated four miles S.W 
 of Boston and is surrounded by fertile
 arable land ,which produces crops of  
 cereals, brassicas and salad crops.To 
 the East is the marsh and from there  
 you may see large ships on their way  
 to and from Boston Docks.There is a   
 wide ,open landscape in all directions
 where beautiful sunsets can be        
 enjoyed.In the centre of the village  
 stands the church ,surrounded by      
 seveal trees.There are shops of all   
 kinds where people from outlying      
 disricts can buy their food and other 
 necessary goods.The centre of the     
 village is made up of older properties
 but during the  past 25 years three   
 new housing estates have been built   
 on the perimeter of the village.
