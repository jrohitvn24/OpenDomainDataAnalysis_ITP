		<title>19Growing on the River Otter</title>
		<content>{The Salt Marsh }The salt marsh is one 
 of the most exciting parts of the     
 River Otter.The plants must be very   
 special because they can live under   
 the water,without water or with just a
 bit of water.                         
{Wild Flowers }There are many colourful
 plants and flowers on the river       
 bank.There is one called the Yellow   
 Flag.It looks like a daffodil but its 
 petals are drooped down like it is    
 dead.There are two kinds of clover.One
 is white and the other is red.The far 
 side of the river bank is covered in  
 trees and bushes.                     
{Farming  }On the Cricket Field side of
 the river there are potato fields and 
 in the next field there is rough      
 grazing with nothing in it.On all the 
 other fields are cattle.Some of the   
 fields have drainage ditches running  
 down.                                 </content>
