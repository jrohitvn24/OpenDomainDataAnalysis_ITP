ago was one of the main sources of     
employment in Burscough.               
Get up at 4a.m.Go onto canal boat.Meals
eaten on boat include breakfast and    
dinner.On short journeys you are home  
for tea.On long journeys you would     
sleep when the boat was being unloaded 
and loaded.Some journeys would take up 
to three weeks.There were many         
different jobs on the barges including 
"walking"the barge under bridges by    
lying on your back and pushing the     
bridge with your feet.Many different   
goods were carried including sugar     
from Liverpool,grain from Burscough    
mill to Liverpool,coal from Wigan to   
Liverpool  and manure from Liverpool   
for spreading on the fields by local   
farmers.
