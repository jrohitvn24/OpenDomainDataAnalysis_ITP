 VILLAGES' HALL, is situated in Broad  
 Lane and serves the communities of the
 three villages. It was built in 1971, 
 extended and refurbished in 1981.     
   The building consists of the main   
 hall with stage, committee room, full 
 kitchen, bar and toilet facilities,   
 together with storage areas. It is    
 surrounded by a car park, grass play  
 area and in 1985 a wooden adventure   
 playground was added.                 
   The hall is administered by a       
 committee consisting of six elected   
 members together with representatives 
 from each of the village groups which 
 use the facilities. These include     
 playgroup, youth club, drama group,   
 parish council, senior citizens club, 
 and political organisations. Various  
 fund raising activities are organised 
 to supplement the income from bookings</content>
