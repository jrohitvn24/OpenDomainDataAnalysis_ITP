		<title>13ROMAN VILLA AT VINYARDS FARM</title>
		<content>  Mr Norman of Vinyards farm is living 
 on the site of an old Roman villa.    
 When he was building his house he     
 found a pillar.  Roman fireplaces were
 found behind the modern house.  The   
 stones next to the fireplaces have    
 gone a pinky red colour. Wall plaster,
 still coloured and remains of a meal  
 of wild boar and food from Oxford and 
 many coins have been found. One coin  
 was very small and needed a magnifying
 glass to see it. The oldest coin was  
 about 215 AD.                         
  The villa was built on a slope and   
 had to be terraced.  It has three     
 rooms in which one had the fireplace. 
 There is a lot of pottery, eg         
 Gloucester gray and red pottery       
 coloured with clay. There were also   
 the wheels on which the pottery was   
 made. Triangular slates were used for 
 the roof.                             </content>
