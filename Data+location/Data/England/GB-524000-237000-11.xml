		<title>11LIFE IN ASHWELL</title>
		<content> Ashwell is a place of commuters and   
 farmers.Some villagers,like Howard Day
 the Baker took great pride in it: he  
 thought it was the "best place in the 
 world".The annual summer open         
 day,"Ashwell At Home",also shows      
 a lot of local pride.People like the  
 village because it is pretty,they like
 the idea of living in the country,or  
 because they've always lived there.   
 On the other hand some Ashwell        
 residents feel cut off from the       
 outside world.Some newcomers would    
 like more facilities in the           
 village.One new arrival felt seperated
 from the older villagers and the      
 newer,wealthier commuters.With        
 high house prices it is hard for young
 people to come into the village.      
 Many older villagers still think of   
 Ashwell as a small farming village but
 it is no longer just that.            </content>
