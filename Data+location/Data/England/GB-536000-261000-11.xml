		<title>11QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY</title>
		<content>    Large proportions of our sample    
 felt that Bar Hill needs more         
 shops,more sporting facilities and    
 generally more for people,especially  
 teenagers,to do.We also found that,   
 because of its design,95% of those    
 questioned consider the village to be 
 a very safe place,especially for      
 children.Some of these people are a   
 little worried though that the village
 is too safe.Children have little or no
 fear of traffic and have not had to   
 develop or learn good road sense.     
    Only 32% of our sample actually    
 work in the village and the vast      
 majority of these are working         
 mums.Those that travel out of the     
 village to work go mainly to          
 Cambridge,Huntingdon or St.Ives,      
 although there is a minority          
 travelling long distances,even as far 
 as London.                            </content>
