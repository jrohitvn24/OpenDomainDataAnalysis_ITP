		<content> Schools occupy large areas of this    
 part of Derby. Some of them were built
 for the old Borough of Derby which was
 rapidly expanding, so the only sites  
 available were on what was adjacent   
 rural land.                           
   Since the 1970's the secondary      
 schools have become{neighbourhood     
{comprehensive}schools for this part of
 Derby. Noel-Baker School is now one of
 the largest schools in the county with
 over 1750 pupils, while the nearby    
 Merrill School has recently become a  
{community school}offering courses for 
 people of all ages. Not far away St   
 Thomas Moore School, which provides a 
 Catholic education for the southern   
 half of the Derby, reflects a current 
 trend. It is soon to close as a result
 of declining numbers following a drop 
 in the{Birth Rate}in the 1970's.
