		<content> I'm sitting on a  beam in the roof of 
 Brighton Station and watching the     
 bustle of human beings trying to catch
 trains.                               
 The smell from "casey Jone's Burgers" 
 is irresistible, no wonder the humans 
 are flocking round buying chips,      
 hamburgers, milkshakes, fish and coke.
 The ground is covvered in rubbish     
 thrown down by selfish humans. The    
 chatter of annoyed passsengers pushing
 and shoving, trying to squeeze onto   
 the crowded platform. The ticket      
 collector clips the tickets as the    
 people tramp along. The flower seller 
 shouts to passer_by which adds to the 
 deafening noise. The porters dump mail
 bags on buggies which shunt along the 
 platforms. The busy, noisy, smelly,   
 station makes an exciting place for   
 any creature, man or pigeon!
