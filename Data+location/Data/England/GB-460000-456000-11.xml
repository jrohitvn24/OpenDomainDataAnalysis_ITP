 School, Haxby we had our sports day.I 
 was in the three-legged race and my   
 partner and I came first,I was in the 
 sprint as well and I came third.      
  We also had to do games skills for an
 hour while the first and second years 
 ran in their races.                   
 I was in Yellow team and I thought we 
 wouldn't win but in fact we did.Yellow
