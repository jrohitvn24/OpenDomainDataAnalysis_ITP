		<title>17Portsdown Park</title>
		<content>  Portsdown Park is a large housing    
 complex to the north of Portsmouth. It
 was built in the early 1970's to house
 people from demolished premises in the
 city.                                 
                                       
  Portsdown Park has three tower blocks
 as well as many smaller buildings and 
 in constructed from brick and         
 concrete. It was designed as the      
 result of a competition but has       
 suffered from many problems since it  
 was built, such as dampness and       
 vandalism. Many people wish it had not
 been built in the way it was.         
 Portsdown Park stands on the slopes of
 Portsdown Hill and is a notable land  
 mark, but some people think that it is
 an eye-sore.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
