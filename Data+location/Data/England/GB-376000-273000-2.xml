		<content>   Bewdley is described as a good      
 example of a{Georgian}town.One of the 
 oldest buildings in the town is the   
 Bailiff's House built in 1610.It is   
 now a restaurant,with natural coloured
 oak framework renovated in 1969.In the
 two main streets are Georgian         
 houses.One example is the Manor House 
 built in 1723.Some still have the     
 false painted windows,a reminder of   
 the{window tax.}                      
   The two main{council estates}are    
 Bark Hill and Queensway built in the  
 1930's.Later in the 1950's two private
 housing estates were built on the site
 of many cherry orchards.So some of the
 roads are named after types of        
 cherries.The latest houses in Bewdley 
 are of French design.Not many houses  
 are built nowadays because of         
 unemployment in the area.
