		<content>    Most people in Wickwar are employed
 around the counties of Avon and Glouce
 stershire because Wickwar is situated 
 on the border of Avon.                
    The main employment areas are Bris 
 tol,Avonmouth,Yate and other places.  
    The village does not provide much  
 employment Spar the main shop,a drap- 
 er's, ther newsagents, the pub "The   
 Buthay, two petrol stations and a soci
 al  club.  Below the playing field    
 there is a trading esta consisting of 
 two steel fabrication companies, a    
 truck yard.   Further down the road   
 there is a cider factory.             
                                       
                                       
     At the moment there are{3,000,000}
 unemployed in England,yet in the south
 there is not quite as much unemploymen
 t as in the north.Luckily Wickwar is  
 in the south.                         </content>
