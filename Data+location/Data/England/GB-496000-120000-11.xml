		<title>11Canadians Visit Petworth</title>
		<content> On Sunday April 28th 1985 a party of  
 250 Canadians belonging to the Toronto
 Scottish Regimental Association       
 visited the town.The Toronto Scottish 
 were a regiment of soldiers who were  
 based in Petworth Park during the     
 Second World War. When the Boy's      
 School was bombed, they were the first
 people to begin digging the bodies    
 out. They came on the fortieth        
 anniversary of VE Day to remember     
 those who were killed during the      
 Second World War and to see the 'new' 
 school (Petworth CE Primary School).
