		<title>09Cauldon Drinking Fountain</title>
		<content>The fountain was given by Charles Bill,
whose initials decorate the stonework  
with the date and "The clouds drop     
fatness". It was originally provided   
with drinking cups for travellers and  
an animal trough. There is an annual   
village custom of "well" dressing.     
Wooden boards in the shape of the well 
are soaked in a pond and are covered   
with heavily salted clay. A local      
artist designs the picture which will  
cover the clay, usually a biblical     
scene with a quotation. The picture is 
drawn on to paper which is placed on   
the clay and the design is pricked     
through with skewers. The lines are    
then marked with small pieces of coal  
and different plants, flowers and      
petals are positioned like roof tiles  
so that the rain drains off without    
damaging the foundations. The finished 
picture is fitted into the well.       </content>
