 you catch any fish you unfortunately  
 have to put them back.{The charge for 
{fishing is Â£1.50 for the day.}The     
 biggest fish in the pond is the mirror
 carp &amp; it weighs about 20 pounds.The  
 best time to fish is at night.Taylors 
 do not let people fish in their ponds,
 only friends.The biggest fish, in the 
 smallest pond, is the tench which can 
 weigh between 4-6 pounds. A great     
 number of people from all over the    
 country come to fish there as you can 
 catch some excellent fish.At all times
