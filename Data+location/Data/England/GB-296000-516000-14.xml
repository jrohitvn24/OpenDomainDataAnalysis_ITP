		<title>14WHITEHAVEN MUSEUM.</title>
		<content> The exhibits in Whitehaven Museum     
 range from stone age axes to brownie  
 regalia.Some exhibits need special    
 care like the medieval St.Bees shroud,
 which is one of the 20,000 exhibits on
 show.Mr Fancy (the curator) told us   
 that there were quite a few exhibits  
 in store which are often used  by     
 researchers.The Market Hall building  
 was built in 1885 but it has only been
 a museum since 1975.There is a tourist
 information centre which hasn't always
 been there. This attracts more        
 people.The museum is financed by the  
 local council,grants from large       
 museums and by a support group.They   
 get 60,000 visitors a year, 5% being  
 foreign tourists.Occasionally they    
 get things they can't identify.The    
 museum is a good source of            
 information, particularly on items of 
 local interest.                       </content>
