		<title>19NEW COMERS' VIEWS</title>
		<content>  Two new comers have lived in the     
 village of {ALMONDSBURY }for about    
 four weeks. They like it very much    
 particulary because it is rural.      
  They have been busy{settling}into    
 their new home so they have not had   
 the chance to get to know their       
 neighbours very well.                 
  They used to live in{GUILDFORD}but   
 decided to move after retiring and    
 since they had orginally came from    
 BRISTOL they decided to{return}here.  
  They both enjoy playing{golf}outside 
 BRISTOL, but the main leisure is at   
 Thornbury Sports Centre.              
  Locally there is one Inn, a post     
 office and a few shops. This is       
 considerably less than where they had 
 come from &amp; they{prefer it}this way.  
  They both go to the{Inn}only         
 occasionally because they find the    
 meals very expensive.                 </content>
