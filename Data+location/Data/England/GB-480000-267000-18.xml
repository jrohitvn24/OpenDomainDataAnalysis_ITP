		<content>The local pub is quite a social        
gathering place for the village. It is 
run by a husband and wife team and they
employ about six bar staff. There is a 
very pleasant garden. They sometimes   
organise their own functions such as   
fancy dress parties on New Years Eve   
and have discos on Public Holidays such
as Easter Monday, May Day etc.. In     
addition they have an outside barbecue 
which they use on occasions through the
year. There is a carvery style         
restaurant, and reasonably priced      
lunches and bar snacks are also served.
There is a billiards table- there is a 
team representing The  Horseshoe, and  
also a darts team. The Horseshoe does  
not cater for weddings.                
The other local restaurant is at the   
Motel which is A.A. and R.A.C. listed  
and in addition to the restaurant has  
49 bedrooms, bars and conference room. </content>
