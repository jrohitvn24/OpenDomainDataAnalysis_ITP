		<content>Country pursuits were paramount in the 
area with walking, surfboarding, horse 
riding, fishing and golf.  Team sports 
include spectators as well as partici- 
pants. There is now no village football
team but the recreation ground is used 
by other teams.   These are all in add-
ition to the various club activities.  
Shooting is carried on locally for par-
tridge, pheasant, rabbits and hares.   
Gardening is regarded as a necessity   
and some allotments are still used.    
   Indoor sport outside the area covers
swimming, roller skating, squash and   
snooker.    Pastimes indoors include   
reading, writing, drinking and brewing 
beer.   People go to whist drives in   
other villages; bridge, card games and 
dice are played.  Adults also attended 
recreational classes in Canterbury.    
Herne Bay Majorettes attracted the     
small girls.                           </content>
