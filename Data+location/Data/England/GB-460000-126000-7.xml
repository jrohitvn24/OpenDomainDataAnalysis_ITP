		<content> There are ten working farms in the    
 area, ranging from small farms of a   
 few acres to very large highly        
 mechanised units.  The farms mainly   
 use the small field system and ancient
 hedgerows have been preserved in most 
 cases.  Approximately 1/3 of the farms
 are arable, 1/3 are arable with       
 pasture and 1/3 have beef cattle.     
 There is also a dairy farm and a farm 
 specialising in intensive egg         
 production.  There are also small     
 holdings with free range poultry and  
 produce, 2 of which also keep a house 
 cow.  There are 4 beekeepers in the   
 area.
