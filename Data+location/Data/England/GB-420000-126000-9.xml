 We conducted a survey of              
 children's leisure time activities.   
 Fifteen children are members of       
 outside organisations. Twelve belong  
 to the youth clubs held in West       
 Grimstead and Alderbury.Four girl     
 guides are members of the Alderbury   
 girl guides and one goes to Salisbury.
 There are two scouts and two cubs, all
 members of the Lockerley pack. All    
 children spent some of their time     
 watching television. The most popular 
 programes are Dallas, Cover up, and   
 Knight Rider. Other indoor activivties
 range from reading and drawing to     
 computer and board games. The main out
 door games are football, cricket and  
 less organised ones like chase.
