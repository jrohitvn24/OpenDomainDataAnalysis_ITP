		<content>Of the world at large ,they said they  
were disappointed with present world   
leaders.They held them responsible     
for famine,war,pollution and the       
nuclear threat .In general they were   
not concerned all the time about world 
issues ,but they did talk about them   
now and then.They felt that there      
future security and happiness would be 
most affected by their chances of      
getting a  good job.They saw the       
problems of unemployment and had       
lost their youth club as a result of   
it.Some of them felt they had a better 
than average chance of getting a       
job because of the  expanding city     
near by.They saw another side of their 
happiness the result of   a warm       
family,and hoped to have succesful     
marriage.They seemed to be a           
thoughtful group of children who were  
able to be positive about their future.</content>
