		<content> A post lady delivers letters          
 and parcels by bicycle in Pebworth and
 Broad Marston Mon. to Sat. Long       
 Marston's mail is delivered by post   
 van. A van collects post from the     
 local post office twice a day and     
 takes it to Stratford sorting office. 
 Sunday collections have now ceased.   
 Each village has a red public phone   
 kiosk from which a 3 min. local call  
 costs l0p. Although most homes have a 
 phone there is still a need for this  
 public service. Both villages have a  
 sub-post office annexed to the general
 store. One can buy postage stamps,    
 T.V. and dog licences, collect weekly 
 child benefit and pensions, pay bills 
 and use National Savings and Giro Bank
 facilities. The amenities offered by  
 these sub-post offices are important, 
 especially to the elderly.
