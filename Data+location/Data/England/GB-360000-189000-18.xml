		<title>18OLDBURY, COWHILL AND KINGTON</title>
		<content>{Oldbury church}is situated on a hill  
 on the outskirts of{Oldbury village.  
 The village used to be where{Cowhill  
 is now but everyone died in the       
{plague.}A blocked up door within the  
 church faces Cowhill and was for the  
 use of those villagers. There is also 
 a tunnel linking the church to St     
{Arild's House.}This was used for      
 smuggling when the{River Severn}flowed
 much closer to the church than it does
 now. This tunnel follows a straight   
 line and does not wiggle like the     
 road. People had forgotten about its  
 existance until a tractor fell into it
 a few years ago.                      
{Kington}means "place of cows". Two    
 years ago there were lots of cows but 
 now there are very few. One KM square 
 has no people living in it at all,    
 despite being so close to towns and   
 villages. Any barns are tumbled down. </content>
