		<title>14GORING GIRL GUIDES</title>
		<content>      My name is Louise Fincham. I     
 belong to a{Guide}company in Goring   
 which meets on Monday nights from 7.30
 to 9.00 pm. The company is called 1st 
 Goring. The uniform includes a navy   
 skirt, blue shirt, pale blue tie, navy
 hat, white socks, brown or black shoes
 and a{Guide}badge.                    
                                       
      At{Guides}we are divided into    
 groups called patrols. Each patrol in 
 turn clears up, chooses a prayer etc. 
                                       
      In{Guides}there are many         
 activities such as rounders, camping  
 and outings, as well as taking badges 
 eg. first aid, hostess and country    
 dancing. Every week we play a game eg.
 traffic lights or ladders, and finish 
 the meeting with a prayer and the     
 guide song Taps.
