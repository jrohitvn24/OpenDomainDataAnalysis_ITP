		<content>   To the south of the Block lies the  
 settlements of Sidbury and Sidford.   
 Both are{Nucleated}and Sidbury has a  
 classic Anglo-Saxon "star shape" form.
 The population of the block is small  
 (probably around 100) and settlement  
 is{dispersed.}Isolated farms and      
 private houses lie about half a mile  
 apart with the exception of five large
 pre-war houses close to the main road.
   In Roncombe,{Mincombe Farm}and{Knapp
{Farm}occupy sites near the valley     
 floor. Between the 8th and 15th       
 centuries these deep wooded valleys   
 were slowly cleared of timber and the 
 higgledy-piggledy fields and narrow   
 lanes laid down. Knapp farm was first 
 mentioned in 1280 as "la Cnapp in     
 manerio de Sydebir". Mincombe Farm is 
 recorded in the Episcopal Register of 
 the Diocese of Exeter in 1313. Wolvers
 -leigh Farm has{Domesday}mention.     </content>
