		<title>15A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A CHILD</title>
		<content>{ }At{09.58}I got up and watched T.V.  
 Then I had breakfast. After I'd been  
 on my bike my mum said "Could you go  
 to Spar for me ?" so I did.           
   At{10.45}I counted my money. Then I 
 cleaned my sports gear out and got my 
 tennis bats and had a game of tennis  
 against the wall.                     
   At{12.00}I had my dinner of cheese  
 on toast and sunbathed until{13.55.   
 After that I watched Sunday           
 Grandstand, the cricket between       
 Nottingham and Sussex.  My brother    
 then told me there was a frog in our  
 pond so we had a look and there was.  
 By now it was{tea_time. }I had chicken
 and ham pie, sweetcorn and for pudding
 I had a choc ice.  Then I had my bath 
 and went to bed.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
