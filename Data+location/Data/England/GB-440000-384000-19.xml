		<title>19ECOLOGY-SHIREBROOK VALLEY</title>
		<content>{    The Shirebrook Valley has provided
 a haven for many uncommon species of  
 plants and animals but has been       
 particularly noted for its wild birds 
 for many generations. At the end of   
 the l9th century it was stated that 77
 varieties of bird had been seen in the
 area round the village of Woodhouse.  
 This old list included kingfisher,    
 heron and corncrake. Recently our     
 school counted how many different     
 varieties of bird we saw in our local 
 Shirebrook Valley. We counted 53.  We 
 are proud of the fact that our valley 
 is the breeding ground for uncommon   
 species of grasshopper, sedge and reed
 warbler and the lesser whitethroat.   
 There is a ringing station within the 
 valley showing that the valley is an  
 important thoroughfare for migrating  
 birds which take shelter in the willow
 and hawthorn bushes.                  </content>
