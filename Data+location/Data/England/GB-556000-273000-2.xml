		<content>   There are three{commons}in Soham    
 providing grazing land, and the town  
 is surrounded by open, flat farmland, 
 mostly arable. Landmarks of note      
 include two{windmills,}one of which is
 still fully operational.              
  {St.Andrew's church}has several      
 reminders of Soham's historical       
 connection with the sea - before Soham
 Mere was drained, sea-going vessels   
 were able to sail right into Soham.   
   Regular events include the{Soham    
{Pumpkin Fair,}held each September and 
 attracting interest from all over     
 England, and the{Spring Carnival,     
 which raises money for local          
 charities.                            
   Outside Soham is the hamlet of      
{Barway,}a small farming community.
