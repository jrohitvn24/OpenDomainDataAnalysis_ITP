		<title>05    THE VILLAGE STORES</title>
		<content>                                       
 One of the village shops is owned by  
 Mr and Mrs Grogan.  The building      
 housing the Village Stores is about   
 200 years old.  Next door to the      
 Village Stores there is a tea shop    
 also owned by the Grogans.  The tea   
 shop building is much newer than the  
 other building.  About 90 people a day
 use the Village Stores.  Their biggest
 sales are newspapers, with food as    
 their next biggest sale.  The tea shop
 closes down in the winter and opens up
 in the summer mostly for passing      
 trade.  About 40 people use the tea   
 shop on a fine summer's day and       
 Saturday is their busiest day.  The   
 shop sells a large variety of goods.  
 There are no permanent workers other  
 than Mr and Mrs Grogan.
