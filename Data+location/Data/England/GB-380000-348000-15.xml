Crackley is mostly residential and     
industrial land.   In Crackley there   
is one school which is a Primary       
School.   There is not entertainment   
except the Youth Club which is very    
popular.   There are no wine or snack  
bars but fish and chip shops are       
available.   Derelict land covers a    
vast area of Crackley which is good    
playing land even though it could be   
quite dangerous.   The grafitti        
spoils Crackley because there is so    
much on doors, walls, floors and       
especially bus shelters.   It's a pity 
someone can't come up with a solution  
to stop this.   If the council got     
together with local people perhaps     
the overgrown gardens and litter could 
be worked out as a community programme.
If there was a competition for the best
kept area that might help.             </content>
