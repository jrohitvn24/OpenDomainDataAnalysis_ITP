		<title>20The Pilgrim's Way at Gatton</title>
		<content>  { Walking, hiking}etc. are very      
 popular pass-times in the area and    
 there are many public footpaths and   
 bridleways. The Pilgrim's way is one. 
    Although the school grounds at     
{Gatton Park}are private, the public is
 allowed to walk through on the        
 footpath.{The North Downs Way}is the  
 same as the Pilgims Way. It is now a  
 road through the school, the course of
 it has been altered because of the    
 school buildings.                     
    The North Downs Way turns back into
 a muddy footpath after{Rocky Lane,}As 
 it goes past Whitehall Farm with its  
 strawberry fields. The footpath has   
 not been changed into roads there     
 because it goes over fields and we    
 need the fields to grow fruit and     
 vegetables - and access is not needed 
 at this point for vehicles.
