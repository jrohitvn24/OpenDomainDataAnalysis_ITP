		<content> The centre of the C.B.D. has many     
 large department stores and this makes
 Manchester a very high order shopping 
 centre. The very large stores include 
 Kendal Milne, Lewis's, and Debenhams  
 along with large branches of Boots and
 especially Marks and Spencer.         
 Fieldwork has shown that people come  
 to shop regularly in Manchester from  
 long distances e.g. from Preston,     
 Warrington and Chester as well as the 
 whole of the Greater Manchester area. 
 Travel to work also shows Manchesters'
 wide influence.                       
 One of attractions for the future is  
 the redevelopment of the old Central  
 Station as a sporting and conference  
 centre. The vast roof of the Victorian
 station has been replaced and all the 
 external brickwork has been mended and
 cleaned. The inside is now being      
 completely rebuilt.                   </content>
