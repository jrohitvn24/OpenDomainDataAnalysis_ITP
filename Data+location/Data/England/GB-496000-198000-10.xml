		<title>10 ATTITUDES.</title>
		<content> A pair of 15 year old boys gave their 
opinions of young peoples attitudes    
towards adults and people in a position
of power.                              
POLITICIANS:Most youths ignore politics
and its leaders because they are not so
directly affected by them.             
POLICE:Generally hated by the younger  
generation because they believe they   
are being picked on and restricted.    
TEACHERS:Again unliked by younger      
people but many of the younger teachers
are accepted because of their age.     
OTHER RACES:There is a very high       
tension between different races today. 
Many people donate to foreign charity  
but many people hate other races       
because they feel a sense of loyalty to
their country and a sense of invasion. 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
