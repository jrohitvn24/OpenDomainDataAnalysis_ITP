		<title>06TORR QUARRY</title>
		<content> Torr Quarry is situated on a ridge of 
 high ground south east of Woodleigh,  
 near the Kingsbridge to Totnes road.  
 An outcrop of a hard volcanic basalt, 
 called Elvan was first quarried here  
 in 1934 when Torr Quarry opened.      
 There were once 50 workmen employed at
 the quarry but gradually the quarry   
 became worked out and in August 1984  
 the last rock was extracted.          
 However the quarry has not closed,    
 rock is brought in from other quarries
 for crushing, and seven men are still 
 employed at the works.                
 In addition there is a ready mix      
 concrete works, and a depot for       
 concrete blocks.                      
 Nearby there is a South Hams District 
 Council Works Depot.                  
 Altogether it is a busy area, and     
 inspite of the end of quarrying there 
 seems to be more diversification now. </content>
