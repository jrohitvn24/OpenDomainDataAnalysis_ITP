		<title>19HOW NORTH YATE HAS CHANGED.</title>
		<content> A few years ago,the whole area        
 consisted of farms and fields,with    
 houses just along North Road,and      
 dotted here and there in the country  
 lanes.North Road itself used to be    
 referred to as"The Golden Mile"because
 of all the land that people owned.    
 Shops have come and gone.The          
 general grocery shop,Royalls,used to  
 be a Post Office.The Post Office is   
 now next door to the school.A fish and
 chip shop that was by the crossroads  
 has long since closed down.In the     
 south-eastern part of the area,the new
 housing estates are growing fast.A new
 road has been built to take traffic   
 from the centre of Yate out onto the  
 main Bristol road.People who have     
 lived here for a long time are        
 concerned that the factories,roads and
 housing will spoil the area.
