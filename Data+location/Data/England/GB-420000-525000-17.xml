		<title>17SHILDON WAGON WORKS</title>
		<content>  Shildon Wagon Works was in business  
 for over 150 years,completing 800     
 repairs each week.It had a great      
 reputation until 1983 when British    
 Rail decided to close it down. My Dad 
 was one of the 2000 workforce to be   
 made redundant.The works and track    
 were demolished and new industry was  
 attracted to the area with the aid of 
 grants,help from BR and new factory   
 units. The town still has one of the  
 highest levels of unemployment in the 
 country.Some of my father's friends   
 took the opportunity to transfer to   
 other BR workshops in other parts of  
 the country, but our family, along    
 with hundreds of others, has          
 commitments in the area and it was    
 impossible for us to uproot the whole 
 of our family and move to another part
 of the country.My father is still     
 unemployed.                           </content>
