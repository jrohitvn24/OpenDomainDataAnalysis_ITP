		<content> Today only the south face of the      
 castle remains,in the shape of a      
 massive wall with its 6 bastions      
 between 120-130ft long,with an        
 isolated pier about 20 yards to the   
 north-west.This pier is probably part 
 of the East face and the entrance     
 gateway.What looks like portcullis    
 grooves can still be seen in the      
 brickwork.The south and west walls    
 have gone altogether.The north side of
 the existing wall clearly shows the   
 probable position of the great hall   
 and various other rooms.Doorways still
 show in the flanking towers where they
 lead to upper and lower storeys.The   
 wall however is not pierced by        
 windows.Evidently the rooms were      
 lighted from the inner courtyard.     
 Traces of a deep moat around the whole
 building can still be seen,whilst a   
 four acre pasture to the North.       </content>
