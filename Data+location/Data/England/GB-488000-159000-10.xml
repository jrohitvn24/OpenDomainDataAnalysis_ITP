		<title>10A DAY IN MY LIFE(1ST SCHOOL)</title>
		<content> Wednesday:In the morning I get out of 
 bed and get washed and dressed.I go   
 down stairs to have my breakfast and  
 then I brush my teeth and do my hair. 
 Ihave it in a ponytail or a plait.One 
 week my mummy takes me to school and  
 another my nextdoor neighbour takes   
 me.At school I work very hard trying  
 to get all my work right.On Wednesday 
 we allways get roast and roast        
 potatoes and cabbage.If we hurry up   
 with lunch we can have an extra play.I
 play with Lisa and Rachel.At school we
 have an adventure playground.We also  
 have apparatus inside and out at      
 school we have singing lessons and    
 assembly and lots of hard lessons like
 maths and other things.so I have some 
 busy days and when I get home I have a
 little play before I go to bed and I  
 brush my teeth and say goodnight.Then 
 I read a book before I go to sleep.   </content>
