		<content> A significant change in the SW corner 
 during the last five years.   Orchards
 have been grubbed and the land        
 returned to a wheat, barley, oil seed 
 rape rotation.                        
 There are two Farm Shops, a Garden    
 Centre and a Pick-Your-Own enterprise 
 next to one of the Farm Shops.        
 Three Dutch growers have recently     
 developed specialist lettuce          
 enterprises.   One grows 20 hectares  
 of outdoor Iceberg lettuce, at 25,000 
 plants per acre, at least 3 crops a   
 year.   He employs up to 25 people.   
 A second grows only seedling lettuce  
 under glass and the third specialises 
 in glasshouse lettuce production      
 generally.   These Dutch growers are  
 all young migrants who have settled in
 Sussex because of land quality and    
 excellent light.   Dutch land prices  
 too high for them. They talk in acres!</content>
