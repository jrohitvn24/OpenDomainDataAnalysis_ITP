		<content>There is a hamlet known as Bishton to  
the north of the river and the canal.  
There is a garage on the main A51 with 
a post office nearby. There are three  
farms and a few houses. Some are of the
post war type and the others are       
cottages that belonged in the past to  
Bishton Hall. Since the Second World   
War Bishton Hall has been a Roman      
Catholic preparatory school known as   
St. Bede's School. It was formerly the 
home of the Sneyds and the Sparrows who
were great benefactors to this area of 
Staffordshire. This part of the county 
has remained unchanged for some thirty 
years and is a typical rural Midlands  
scene. The farmland is mostly arable   
with some acreage given over to sheep  
rearing. The London Midland railway    
crosses through this area.
