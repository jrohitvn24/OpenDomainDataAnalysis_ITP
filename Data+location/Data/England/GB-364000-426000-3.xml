		<content> The oldest part of the hall was built 
 before{1587}and{Mr.E.Pawson}has lived 
 inthe hall fifty six years.Above the  
 door there is a{datestone}with the    
 date of when that part of the house   
 was built{"1587"}and the initials of  
 both the owner and builder (it is     
 thought).The style of the house is {  
{Elizabethan.}It has quite a few       
 special features.It has{Mullioned}    
 windows &amp;{oak}beams.The front door of 
 2 inch thick oak has{metal studs}-one 
 for each day of the year.Such a door  
 would have made it difficult to break 
 down &amp; attack the Hall.The living room
 has an{Inglenook Fireplace.}Behind the
 fireplace there is a secret{Priesthole
 where the{Monks}used to hide in times 
 of danger.The Hall stands in{seventy  
{acres}of land,under which is a{tunnel}
 leading to another Hall nearby,used to
 escape from the Old Hall unobserved.  </content>
