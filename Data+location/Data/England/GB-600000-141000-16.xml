At the Stour Centre you can do

and a play centre.  The Stour Centre   
is near the railway station and the bus
station, and the town centre.  It is a 
fairly new building.  It has two       
swimming pools - a big one, and a      
little one with warm water for         
learners.  In the Stour Centre there   
is a bar where anybody can go.  You    
can sit and watch people play bowls in 
winter.    The Stour Centre is a good  
place for families to go because there 
are lots of different things to do.    
You don't need to be a member to go    
there.    Sometimes they have          
pop-concerts and exhibitions.          
   There is an Ideal Home Exhibition
