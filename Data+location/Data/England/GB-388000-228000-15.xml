		<title>15ST.JAMES THE GREAT CONTINUED</title>
		<content>  The paintings show one of the few    
 complete illustrations of the life and
 martyrdon of St. James to be found    
 anywhere in Europe.  The paintings    
 tell the story of the conversion of   
 Hermogeness the Magician and Philetus 
 his disciple, by St.James. This       
 success eventually leads to his       
 execution at the hands of             
 Herod Agrippa.  Rather like the       
 Bayeux Tapestry, the paintings have   
 the appearance of a strip cartoon.    
 the figures lack proportion but the   
 identity of the characters is made    
 easy by their elaborately patterned   
 costumes and fantastic hats.          
 Throughout the whole cycle , St. James
 wears ecclesiastical vestments and a  
 Bishop's mitre.
