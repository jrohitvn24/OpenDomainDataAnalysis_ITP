 This area is interesting historically 
 with a Royal residence used as a home 
 and of such beauty and size that it   
 attracts millions of tourists to the  
 area creating wealth and employment   
 locally.                              
 The river Thames flowing through      
 Windsor,Datchet and Old Windsor       
 increases the beauty of the area,     
 provides transport and creates local  
 employment.                           
 The Royal Farms are intensively worked
 creating jobs for locals with housing 
 included.                             
 The close proximity of London and the 
 good road and rail links ensure that  
 it will remain a popular and          
 prosperous residential area with many 
 bread-winners commuting daily to the  
 city.The Great Park provides open     
 countryside for leisure activities.   </content>
