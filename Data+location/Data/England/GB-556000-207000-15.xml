		<content> difficult to know where the social    
 centre of the village will be.   The  
 village does now have a               
 priest-in-charge (the Rev. Peter      
 Turner who is rector of four          
 parishes); the owner of the Village   
 Shop and Post Office at Fyfield, Mr.  
 Wilkinson, takes his Post Office      
 facilities to Willingale for a        
 few hours on Tuesdays (in the village 
 hall).  But there will be no          
 substitute for the school.            
 The village has been very close.   The
 Sixties Club has been entertained by  
 the school and have returned the      
 hospitality.   Events are held in the 
 village hall in addition to the       
 regular clubs such as badminton.   The
 library calls every Friday.   Shopping
 is done over a wide area - Chelmsford,
 Fyfield, Ongar, Romford, Brentwood and
 Harlow.                               </content>
