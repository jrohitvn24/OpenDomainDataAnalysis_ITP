		<title>08RIVER EXE AT BICKLEIGH</title>
		<content> The{river Exe}is probably the most    
 important feature, geographically     
 speaking, to be found in this block.  
 Of secondary importance is the{river  
{Dart.}Both flow through steepsided    
 valleys of notable{picturesque beauty.
 Virtually the only{level ground}lies  
 in the bottom of the Exe Valley.      
 Because of these topographical        
 features, both the{main road          
 and the{disused railway line}from     
 Exeter to Tiverton closely follow the 
 route taken by the river. In summer   
 the rivers are relatively small, but  
 after winter rains, when they are in  
 spate, they result in{flooding}of     
 low-lying fields and parts of the     
 nearby road. The river Exe provides   
 notable{recreation facilities. Canoe  
{races}are held several times each     
 year.{Angling}for trout and salmon    
 also takes place.                     </content>
