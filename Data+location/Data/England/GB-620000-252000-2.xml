		<content> The East Suffolk College of           
 Agriculture and Horticulture is a     
 demonstration farm situated at Otley. 
 It is made up of Charity Farm and     
 Stanaway Farm and these are for the   
 practice of improved techniques and   
 development in agriculture. Charity   
 Farm provides field training in farm  
 skills and demonstration plots, crops 
 and livestock for teaching purposes.  
 The area of land, about 330 acres, is 
 well drained chalky boulder clay. This
 supports a rotation of crops from     
 winter wheat to oil seed rape. There  
 is also a calf-rearing unit, producing
 280 12 week-old calves per year and an
 intensive beef unit which finishes    
 about 100 animals per year. The       
 Teaching Farm area of 30 acres        
 provides grazing and hay for about 100
 ewes and 50 sows.
