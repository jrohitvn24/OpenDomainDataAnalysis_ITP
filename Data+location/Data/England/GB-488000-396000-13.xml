		<title>13S/N: Media - The Parish News</title>
		<content> The "Parish News" which appears       
 monthly (except August) was first     
 issued in 1973 and is now established 
 as a very useful means of communi-    
 cation. Published and printed by      
 Scotton Parish Church the Parish News 
 is delivered free of charge to every  
 house in the parishes of Scotton and  
 Northorpe; it costs about Â£10 an issue
 to produce (partly offset by advertise
 -ments from local tradesmen). The mag-
 azine opens with a 2-3 page message   
 from the incumbent; there is often an 
 item by the local Methodist minister. 
 Christenings, confirmations, marriages
 and deaths are recorded and details   
 given of church services at Scotton   
 and Northorpe and other church activ- 
 ities: from the Bible Study Group to  
 the rota for church cleaning. It also 
 gives news of general village events  
 and club activities.                  </content>
