		<title>07DEVIL'S DITCH NEAR ANDOVER</title>
		<content>     Little can be seen today but, to  
 judge from the section exposed by the 
 railway cutting which runs across it, 
 the{Devil's Ditch}near Andover could  
 have been as much as nine feet deep.  
                                       
     Although no more than 800m long on
 the map, it is claimed to be traceable
 from{Chute Hill,}seven miles to the   
 north-west, down through nearby       
{Harewood Forest,}and even as far as   
 the{River Test}over four miles to the 
 south.                                
                                       
     The function of the ditch remains 
 a mystery, but it may well have been  
 nothing more sinister than an early   
{boundary dyke,}marking the land of a  
 local tribe !                         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
