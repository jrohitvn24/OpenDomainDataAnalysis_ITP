 REMAIN (SEE PAGE 14).MANY MINERS'     
 FAMILIES FACED HARDSHIP AND           
 TRIBULATION WHICH LED TO CLOSELY-KNIT,
 SUPPORTIVE COMMUNITIES WHICH STILL    
 EXIST DESPITE THE CESSATION OF MINING 
 AND THE REMOVAL OF MANY MINERS TO THE 
 NEW COALFIELD AT SELBY.APART FROM A   
 SMALL MINORITY WHO WORK ON THE LAND,
