		<content>    {Middle Wyke}and{Lower Wyke}are    
 typical of the many{small farms}in    
 this part of Hampshire. Both grow     
 fields of{wheat, barley}and{rape,}the 
 oil from which is used for cooking and
 making margerine. Lower Wyke Farm has 
 140 head of{Fresians}which need to be 
 milked twice a day and as the first   
 milking is at 5 a.m., it's an early   
 start for the dairy farmer !          
     Even small farms need expensive   
{machinery.}Although the{tractors}will 
 be in use throughout the year, each   
 farm's{Combine Harvester}or{seed      
{driller}may well be lying idle for all
 but a few weeks. Because the farmers  
 rely so much upon their machines and  
 because they are so expensive to buy, 
 the greatest care is taken to look    
 after them. On Middle Wyke Farm there 
 is a{1947 Fordson tractor}which has   
 been lovingly restored.               </content>
