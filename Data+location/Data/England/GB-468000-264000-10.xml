  Almost all farms are tenanted from   
the Spencer estate which has ten farms 
leased in the area.There are some small
holdings on what was Glebe land.These  
are privately owned.There is also a    
garden centre.                         
  The average size of field is between 
20 and 40 acres.Grazing land accounts  
for roughly a third of all acreage.The 
remainder being given over to wheat,   
barley and oil seed rape.No field      
within the perimeter of Harlestone is  
ploughed.                              
  Although sheep and beef cattle are   
commonplace there is only one dairy    
herd of seventy cows which produces    
5,000 litres of milk a year.           
  Most sheep are sheared by contractor 
but a villager in Harlestone shears    
small numbers.There are at least two   
sheep dips within the survey area.     </content>
