		<title>16HOMES AND HOUSES IN RUNCORN</title>
		<content>{Introduction:}There is an old and a   
 new Runcorn. In old Runcorn there are 
 many terraced houses and some newer   
 flats for old people.The first new    
 estate in Runcorn New Town was begun  
 in 1966.Since then many other         
 estates,corporation and private,have  
 been built.The houses,flats,bungalows 
 and maisonettes in the New Town have  
 green spaces,courtyards,car parks and 
 play parks around them.The Old Town   
 also has small parks so everybody can 
 enjoy them.Also it is safe for        
 pedestrians as you can walk to the    
 shops and leisure centres easily.Some 
 houses are brick,some have wood       
 facing,the flats are grey concrete    
 slabs with deck walkways.In places    
 like Halton there is even a Norman    
 castle on the hill which has looked   
 over our homes for many centuries.
