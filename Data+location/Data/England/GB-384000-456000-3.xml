		<title>03A Typical School Day</title>
		<content>    Hellifield County Primary School   
 starts at 9.15am. for the 59 pupils.  
    Most of us walk to school, but     
 children from outlying farms come in  
 cars.                                 
    Ages range from 4.5 to 10 years.   
    In our class after reading, we have
 a recorder lesson, then assembly or   
 singing in the hall.                  
    After playtime in the yard (on the 
 field in summer), we do writing and   
 art. Some work at the computer.       
    The bell goes at 12.15pm. for      
 dinner.Some of us bring packed        
 lunches,but most eat school dinners   
 cooked at Settle High School.         
    In the afternoon we do maths, topic
 work and science until 2.40pm.        
    After play we have P.E. or         
 story until home-time.                
    Gymnastics Club is after school.
