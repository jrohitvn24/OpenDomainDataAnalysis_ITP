		<content>  SHELVES CLOSE CHARITY comes under the
 control of the Charity Commissioners. 
                                       
 From donations made by various        
 benefactors, at different times,      
 SHELVES CLOSE, a field of about       
 3 1/4 acres at PRESCOTT, was          
 bought about 1794 for the sum of Â£150.
                                       
 The land was let as allotments and the
 income used to give eight old men and 
 women in the Parish a sum of money at 
 Christmas.                            
                                       
 This land is still let and the eight  
 oldest still receive their gift at    
 Christmas each year.                  
                                       
 The Charity is administered by two    
 Trustees appointed by the Parish      
 Council and three others co-opted.
