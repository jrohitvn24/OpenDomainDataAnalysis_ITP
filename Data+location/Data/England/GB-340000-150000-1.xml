		<content> The predominant feature of the area is
 pasture land some of which is low     
 lying heavy clay and the remainder    
 reasonably drained higher ground. This
 dictated the early settlement pattern,
 which in turn has been affected       
 latterly by the advent of the car, the
 M5 motorway and the Severn suspension 
 bridge. The original hamlets and      
 villages,part of the Bempstone        
 Hundred and later the open field      
 system, now have a mixture of modified
 or extended cottages and modern       
 housing. The farms, once renowned     
 for their dairy produce and cider     
 making, now by a combination of       
 goverment grants and E.E.C. milk      
 quotas produce beef cattle, sheep ,   
 Friesian dairy cows and pigs. The     
 farms vary from private ownership to  
 rented farms from Somerset C.Council.
