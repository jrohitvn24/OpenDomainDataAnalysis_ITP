		<content> People in our area no longer have     
 their own fire srevice, although there
 used to be a private one in bygone    
 days. Fire tenders have to be called  
 from the volunteer fire station in    
 Shepton Mallet in the event of an     
 emergency. Neither village has their  
 own policeman anymore and are the     
 responsability of an area policeman   
 based in a nearby village. However he 
 tries to retain a close relationship  
 with his villages, in particular by   
 visiting the schools and getting to   
 know the children. A travelling       
 library takes books deep into the     
 surrounding countryside fortnightly   
 and visiting the housebound on their  
 route. There is only one doctor who   
 has his surgery in Oakhill, patients  
 of other doctors have to travel to    
 Shepton Mallet, Chilcompton,or        
 Midsomer Norton.                      </content>
