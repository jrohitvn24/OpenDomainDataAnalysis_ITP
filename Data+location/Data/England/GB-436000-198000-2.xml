		<content>            (Afternoon)                
 After lunch of sandwiches,crisps,cake 
biscuits,fruit &amp; a drink we went pond  
dipping,our group caught many small    
creatures.We got back to school at     
3p.m.Two friends came to my house to   
make sweets (fudge, truffles,coconut   
ice &amp; marzipan)for Fathers Day.Ellen   
stayed for tea of steak &amp; kidney pie   
or stew plus vegetables,with chocolate 
pudding for sweet.After tea we cycled  
to choir where we practiced Sundays    
hymns.There was about 15 of us there.  
After choir Ellen and I parted and     
cycled home.I watched top of the pops  
and a few other programmes on          
television until I went to bed at      
10.30.
