		<title>08N. Lopham School Today</title>
		<content>      Our school is called St.         
 Andrew's.  The school has 3 teachers  
 and the age range is rising 5's to    
 11's.  There is a infant class, a     
 1st and 2nd year class and a 3rd and  
 4th year class.  There are about 70   
 pupils.   When you are a 4th year, you
 leave North Lopham school and most of 
 us go to Diss High. The school has a  
 meadow, 2 climbing frames and 2       
 playgrounds.  The work we do is       
 History, Maths, English, Science,     
 Geography, Art, Games, etc. We have 3 
 playtimes.  There is a canteen where  
 we have lunch.  We go swimming every  
 week.  The school teaches children    
 from 3 villages - North Lopham, South 
 Lopham and Blo Norton.  Our biggest   
 problem is the poor standard of       
 decoration and repair.  Staff and     
 parents have been trying to get       
 improvements for some time.           </content>
