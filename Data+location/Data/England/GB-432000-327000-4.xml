		<title>04The church at Twyford</title>
		<content> The church in Twyford is made from    
 stone,which is very old.I should say  
 the person who built the church was   
 very wise.Particularly since he built 
 it in the right place considering     
 Twyford usually gets flooded every    
 winter.The church never has been      
 flooded.The church is very old but is 
 in good condition.Like every church it
 has its own graveyard. All the grave  
 stones are facing the East since they 
 belive god appears from the East.In   
 the graveyard the grass was very      
 springy because unlike some           
 people,people cant afford grave       
 stones,so they just buired them       
 anywhere.The church is old but not as 
 old as the arch in the church.Past the
 old arch it is especially decorated   
 for marriges and other special        
 things,with a blue matching velvet    
 carpet lied out.                      </content>
