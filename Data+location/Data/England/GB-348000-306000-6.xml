		<content>   When we visited the golf course at  
 Condover,Mr.Morrison,the secretary,   
 showed us round the greens.He said    
 that there were 55 bunkers which had  
 to be raked every day.The sand is     
 delivered from Norton Quarry once a   
 year.                                 
   There are lots of grass cutters for 
 different parts of the course.The     
 rough is cut by a gang mower.The      
 approaches to the greens are cut by a 
 cushman which has spikes that aeriate 
 the grass.The greens themselves have  
 very fine grass which is watered by   
 automatic sprinklers twice each night.
   There is a professional golfer who  
 gives lessons and has a shop where you
 can buy new equipment or get old      
 equipment repaired.                   
   There is also a snooker room,two    
 bars,a dining room and changing rooms 
 with showers.                         </content>
