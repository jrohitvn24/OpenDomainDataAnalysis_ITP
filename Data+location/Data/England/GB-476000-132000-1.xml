 Our area is historically very         
 interesting.In our 3km x 4km Domesday 
 block there is the site of a Roman    
 road that runs straight through our   
 area and passes by Blackmoor House.The
 Romans built their roads straight and 
 this is a perfect example.In our area,
 two Roman coin hoards have been       
 found,and also a Bronze age hoard.The 
 Bronze age hoard was found in the     
 Hogmoor Inclosure in about 1870.We    
 have seventeen Tumuli which are       
 ancient burial mounds. In Whitehill   
 there is an old railway which was used
 in the Second World War,but is now not
 used.The Old School House was built in
 1871 and is now called Blackmoor      
 Village Hall.
