		<title>04A visit to Dunkirk,Talke</title>
		<content>We were really excited on 16th May     
1985.We were going to look around      
Dunkirk in Clough Hall's               
minibus.Parrots  Druble has been in    
the Â£Evening Sentinal'.Volinteers from 
the Staffordshire conservation trust   
have   built a bridge to study         
wildlife and marshes.                  
Dunkirk Farm,no longer in use,had a    
boxer dog and some geese.Two mums,Mrs  
Hughes and Mrs Tipper suggested we     
sketched here.As we left we came to a  
field full of rape seed grass.Mr       
Williams nearly fell into a drainage   
ditch as he tried to get a rape seed   
plant.We came across some cottages     
called Meadowside whitch were a hundred
years old.At Bignall End Farm we asked 
Mrs sellars if we could visit,but she  
just said no.A final look towards      
Wedgewoods monument and we returned to 
school.                                </content>
