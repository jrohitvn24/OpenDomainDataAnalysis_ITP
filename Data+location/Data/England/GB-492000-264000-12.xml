		<title>12FARMING:HILLY FARM, RUSHDEN</title>
		<content>Hilly Farm has about 11 acres in       
ourÂ£D' block.Mrs Willmott told us the  
land had been drained,so the soil was  
light.If it had not been,the land would
be marshes.Mr Willmott is a thatcher as
well as a farmer,so he grows his own   
straw for thatching.The wheat is a spec
-ial type called Huntsman,it has espec-
ially long stalks.Modern machinery can-
not be used to harvest the wheat be-   
cause it crushes the straw which makes 
it useless for thatching.Instead a     
machine called a binder is used.A      
threshing machine is used after the    
wheat has been in the fields for 1-2   
weeks,to remove the grains from the    
straw.Then the straw is stored in a    
Dutch barn.The straw that was too short
for thatching would be used as animal  
bedding, and some would be sold to make
corn dollies.The grains would be sold  
to millers to be ground into flour.    </content>
