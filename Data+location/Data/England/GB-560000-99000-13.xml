		<title>13Leisure Pool.</title>
		<content> Eastbourne Leisure Pool is on the     
 eastern edge of town along the        
 seafront. There are {3 pools, a main  
{pool, a diving pool and a trainer     
{pool.} The main pool is 33x15m.       
 There are toilets and showers in each 
 changing room. The pool is open every 
 day.  Refreshments are available in   
 the cafeteria and bar.                
 Now there are exciting plans for wave 
 machines, flume rides, a jacuzzi, a   
 sun terrace and more restaurants.     
 These should be ready within a year.  
 There will also be a luxury           
 residential and holiday village around
 the pool.                             
 Eastbourne Borough Council are hoping 
 that the new attractions will bring   
 families for the whole day.
