		<content> In this area there are quite  lot of  
 small farms but they do not provide a 
 lot of work for people other than the 
 farmer and his own family.Many people 
 work in shops in Truro,Redruth and    
 Camborne.There are a few small        
 factories around here such as C.A.W.  
 which makes windows and employs about 
 50 people.A lot of people are         
 unemployed,about 18%.                 
   Lots of people make some money in   
 the holiday season by taking in       
 holidaymakers in one of their spare   
 rooms.They charge about Â£6 for bed and
 breakfast for each person.            
   Wages are not very high in this     
 area,for example a man who works for  
 C.A.W.making windows might take home  
 Â£80-Â£90 which is not a lot and an     
 ancillary assistant in a school earns 
 less than Â£2 an hour.
