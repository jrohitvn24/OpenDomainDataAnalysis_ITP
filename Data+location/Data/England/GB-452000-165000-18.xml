		<title>18THATCHAM BOY'S AFTERNOON.</title>
		<content>   At school I stopped work for lunch  
 at 12.05 when I had some marmite      
 crackers and two home-made buns       
 sitting with my friends in the hall   
 cum gym cum dining hall after which I 
 went out to play.                     
   Soon I was back in the classroom    
 doing my second section of work for   
 the day (mostly finishing graphs)     
 knowing that I would be going home    
 which I soon did.                     
 I immediately got changed and went to 
 play "War" with my friends. At roughly
 seven o' clock I came in to watch     
 TV, I had a bath and went to bed.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
