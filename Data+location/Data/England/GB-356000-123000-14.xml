		<content>    There is no police station in our  
 area but the local policeman is based 
 in Marston Magna.                     
    There is very little crime but     
 there are breakins in to shops and    
 garges at fairly regular intervals.The
 police are called to road accidents   
 quite frequently but they are seldom  
 within the area,though the police cars
 travel along the A359 and A303.       
    The local policeman covers a wide  
 area and can be called to other       
 areas,miles away to help in           
 troubles.This year he went to         
 Stonehenge to help prevent an invasion
 of people there on Midsummers day     
    The policeman is called out to deal
 with drunkeness,which is not a        
 criminal offence.                     
    The policeman relies on a central  
 computer in London for information.
