		<content> The village has no Public House or    
 Cafe and so all indoor activities     
 centre around the Village Hall which  
 belongs to the F.C. The hall has a    
 separate licensed bar which is open   
 only to members; however members and  
 groups are allowed to take personal   
 friends and visiting teams for darts  
 matches etc.                          
 The other end of the hall is quite    
 large and seats over 100 people. It is
 regularly used by the W.I. and an Over
 60's Club etc. and can be hired for   
 parties and functions such as Jumble  
 Sales.                                
 The village has active football and   
 cricket teams which play on the       
 village green, but a bowls green and  
 tennis court were allowed to lapse    
 about 10yrs ago. Horse riding is      
 allowed along marked trails and small 
 boats can be used on the river.       </content>
