		<title>12A TYPICAL CHILD'S SUNDAY</title>
		<content>  On Sunday, I woke up at about 8.30 &amp; 
sit up &amp; read a book. At 9 o'clock I   
went to have a bath, get dressed &amp; have
my breakfast. I had Co-Co Pops &amp;       
toast.   After breakfast I cycled down 
to the garage (with my mum &amp; dad),     
where our car is kept, &amp; I helped to   
clean it.   For dinner we had          
chicken, boiled potatoes, peas,        
carrots then apricot tart.             
  After dinner, I went out to play with
Tracey &amp; we looked for ladybirds. At 3 
o'clock we went to St.Peter's Church   
Flower Festival.                       
  For my tea I had sandwiches, crisps, 
biscuits &amp; cakes. After tea, I played  
with my dolls &amp; my tea set &amp; then I    
had some supper. I brushed my hair &amp;   
put it up in a "pony-tail", cleaned my 
teeth &amp; went to bed.                   
                                       
                                       </content>
