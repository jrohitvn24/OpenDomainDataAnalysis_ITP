		<title>01Introduction to Stowmarket</title>
		<content>Stowmarket is a busy market town set   
in fertile, undulating countryside.    
The A45 and the railway carry people   
and goods through it on a large scale. 
Although some residents work as far    
afield as London, many are employed    
locally, either by large multi-national
companies or by small indigenous       
concerns.                              
       Stowmarket is expanding.  It    
has already linked up with the village 
of Combs and is sprawling towards      
Stowupland and Onehouse.  This has     
overloaded some roads and there are    
plans to reduce congestion in the      
town centre.                           
        This area does not display     
extremes of wealth and poverty.  There 
is a mixture of council and            
privately-owned housing.  Brick and    
tile are the dominant building         
materials. Flint is infrequently used. </content>
