		<title>14Michael's Busy Day  1</title>
		<content>  I woke up at 8.30 on Saturday morning
 and thought "Great! No school." My mum
 shouted "Get up now, I want to do the 
 beds." so very slowly I did. I heard  
 the car starting as my dad went to    
 work. I went downstairs, had my       
 breakfast, then went to see what was  
 on TV.I watched The Saturday Picture  
 Show until 10.30 then got my bike from
 the garage while mum held the dog to  
 stop him escaping. At the rec. I met  
 some friends and we did some jumps on 
 our bikes.Then we played tick on the  
 slide. I went home and after lunch dad
 said "Are you coming for a walk?" We  
 saw a nest in the reeds with six eggs.
 All of a sudden, we heard the clapping
 of wings. It was a moorhen and we saw 
 it land and go on its' nest. When we  
 got home it was 1 o'clock. I altered  
 the handlebars on my bike and then it 
 was lunchtime.                        </content>
