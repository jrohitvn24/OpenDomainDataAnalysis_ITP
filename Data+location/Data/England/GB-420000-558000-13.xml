		<content> Ravensworth Estates.                  
 Until l965 Ravensworth castle built on
 the site of a l3th century monastery, 
 was owned by the Liddell family. The  
 Liddells, as Lords of Ravensworth,    
 date from the time of Queen Elizabeth 
 I and played an important part in     
 political life as mayors of Newcastle.
  They became entrepreneurs, investing 
 in coal mining. The castle,           
 constructed of sandstone from         
 Springwell quarries, was added on to  
 the l5 century towers. During world   
 war II it was used by the army and    
 later became a girls' school. After   
 mining subsidence caused severe damage
 Lord Ravensworth decided to use the   
 castle stone for building houses      
 within the grounds leaving only the   
 towers. During the last 20 years the  
 estate, houses and land were sold to  
 meet heavy death duties.              </content>
