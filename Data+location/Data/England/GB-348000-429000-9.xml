 monopoly,cards,tennis against a wall,

 computer games.Many individual games  
 are self created although the consumer
 society shows a drift from traditional
 and self created games to commercial  
 products.                             
 "Sevensies" is a game in which a ball 
 is thrown against a wall and different
 things are done (hand clapping etc)   
 before it is caught.                  
 Group games include "Queenio-cokeyo" ,
 British Bulldogs,Ghostbusters(from a
