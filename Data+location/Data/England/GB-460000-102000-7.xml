		<title>07CHANGING FACE OF TOURISM</title>
		<content> In the early 1900's the majority of   
 "tourists" came from Portsmouth.  They
 came in groups by boat or road to     
 spend a day at the castle.            
 Portchester, at this time, was mainly 
 farmland and market gardens.  Castle  
 Street was flourishing, with six      
 Pubs to cope with the influx of       
 visitors, but only two, The Cormorant 
 and The White Hart now remain.        
 Nowadays Castle Street tolerates,     
 rather than welcomes, the tourists.   
 The majority of visitors still come   
 from the surrounding area but an      
 increasing number are foreigners. The 
 welfare of Portchester as a town has  
 never relied heavily on the tourist   
 industry, and it is only in recent    
 years that the history of Portchester 
 has attracted any great outside       
 interest.
