		<title>13The Railway Line at Bayford</title>
		<content>   This line is part of the important  
{commuter line}from N. Herts into      
 London. At peak hours trains into     
 London stop at  the station every 10  
 minutes. The Cuffley-Bayford-Hertford 
 extension was built between 1918 and  
 1920. The boring of the tunnel was    
 carried out by August 1915. The       
{Ponsbourne Tunnel}passes beneath      
 Ponsbourne Park. Ponsbourne was the   
 last tunnel along this line to be     
 built by traditional methods. It has 5
 ventilation shafts, and is 1\ miles   
 long. The tunnel is one of the very   
 few totally circular tunnels still    
 surviving.                            
  {Bayford station}itself is           
 situated \ mile north of the tunnel,  
 on the road between Bayford and       
 Brickendon.
