		<title>19TOPICAL ARGUMENTS</title>
		<content> In a rural area such as ours the main 
 topics for dicussion are to do with   
 farming.One such concern is stubble   
 burning,the danger factor of smoke on 
 the road and complaints about debris. 
 Another is mud on the road. This is   
 usually in connection with sugar beet 
 lorries as this is harvested in the   
 Autumn.Every year used to see more and
 more hegderows being pulled up and    
 ditches filled in to make larger      
 fields.Now farmers have realised the  
 harm that has been done and have      
 started tree planting and copicing    
 hedges.                               
 Another issue is aircraft noise as    
 there are 5 R.A.F. stations within a  
 20 mile radius.However the R.A.F.are  
 aware of the nuisance value and       
 usually put notices in the local paper
 to warn of low-level flying and night 
 flying.                               </content>
