		<content> Because this area has such a low      
 population and so few dwellings, the  
 residents have to go to nearby        
 villages and towns for the services   
 of doctors, dentists, opticians and   
 chiropodists.                         
 The nearby village of Chiseldon has a 
 newly built health centre, housing    
 the practice of several doctors and   
 providing pharmacy facilities.        
 There are doctors,  dentists,         
 opticians and chiropodists in several 
 of the larger villages and towns,     
 all within 10 miles of the Upper      
 Upham district, such as Wroughton,    
 Swindon and Marlborough.              
 There are several hospitals within 10 
 miles, including Princess Margarets   
 and The Victoria Hospital in Swindon, 
 Princess Alexandra RAF Hospital and   
 The Ridgeway (private) in Wroughton   
 and a cottage hospital in Marlborough.</content>
