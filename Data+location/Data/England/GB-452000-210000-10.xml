		<title>10THE VILLAGE OF NOKE</title>
		<content>  The lower part of the village of Noke
 lies just within the block to the     
 North.  It is very isolated, being    
 situated at the end of a "no through  
 road" which leads off the B42O7.  At  
 the beginning of this road,which leads
 steeply downhill, there are beautiful 
 views over the valley of Otmoor.      
  The houses in this lower part of the 
 village vary.  Some are modern        
 post-war houses, built to blend in    
 with the rest of the village.  At the 
 extreme end of the village there is   
 a beautiful old manor house.  There   
 is a bridleway from this end of the   
 village leading behind Prattle Wood   
 back to the B4O27.                    
  Unlike Woodeaton and Elsfield, Noke  
 has a public house. This is very      
 popular because as well as all kinds  
 of alcoholic drinks they serve nice   
 meals. The inn is not in the block.   </content>
