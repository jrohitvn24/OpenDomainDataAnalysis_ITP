 The first pier, built in 1860, was    
 washed away. A second pier was built  
 in 1870. The Council bought it for    
 Â£2,600 in 1880 and it is now          
 controlled by the Ventnor Local Board 
 Act 1884. A hole was made in it during
 the War and was eventually rebuilt and
 re-opened in 1955. It is 683 feet long
 and built on cast iron piles. The main
 deck is wooden and the pier-head is   
 made of concrete. Nowadays the main   
 attraction on the pier is an Amusement
 Arcade, with fruit machines, computer 
 games and Bingo. People fish from the 
 pier-head where large conger eels can 
 be caught. There are plans to rebuild 
 the pier and restore it to its        
 original form with a landing stage for
 boats, better fishing facilities and a
 tea room.
