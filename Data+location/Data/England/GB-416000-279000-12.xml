		<content>  The bulk of the school population is 
 found in the residential area to the  
 west. Within the block there are 2    
 schools serving the primary age group.
  Coppice Junior School, built in the  
 1930's and extended in the 1960's, it 
 has a school population of about 250  
 children from 7 to 11+.               
  Yew Tree Primary school was built in 
 the late 1970's. It has an infant -   
 junior department of about 180        
 children. In the case of both schools 
 the new residential area may increase 
 it's school population. Children in   
 the rural areas must travel to their  
 nearest school.                       
  A large public recreation ground     
 marked out for rugby union and soccer 
 is situated close to the residential  
 area. Three private sports grounds are
 located along Lugtrout Lane there is a
 cricket ground at Catherine de Barnes.</content>
