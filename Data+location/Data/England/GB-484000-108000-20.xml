		<title>20Lavant Scool goes Swimming</title>
		<content> Lavant Primary School swims every     
 Monday. About 70 children, that is 3  
 classes go to Chichester swimming pool
 by coach. The journey takes 10        
 minutes. There are five depths: one is
 3', the second is 4', the third is 5',
 the fourth is 6' &amp; the last is 12'6"  
 deep. The youngest group learn to swim
 in the shallow end with floats. The   
 oldest group use the deep end. We     
 learn front-crawl, breast stroke, back
 stroke and diving. We jump and dive   
 off the diving boards, go down the    
 slides and also swim underwater. We   
 are awarded Certificates and Badges   
 for swimming different lengths, e.g.  
 10 metres, 25m, 50m, 100m, 200m, 400m,
 800m. This year two boys and a girl   
 swam 1500 metres. We also train for   
 survival badges.
