		<content> Amongst the schools in the area there 
 is Gleadless Valley comprehensive.This
 school takes most of its pupils from  
 the local council house estate.In 1985
 there were 46 teachers to cater for   
 760 pupils.As we write the school life
 is being disrupted by teachers        
 withdrawing their goodwill this means 
 not doing tasks they aren't being paid
 for,e.g.running school teams and      
 clubs,and developing the school       
 curriculum in their own time.         
 Normally a pupil would find a typical 
 day as follows:registration at 9 a.m. 
 followed by lessons till noon,with a  
 short break in between.In the         
 afternoon we work from 1 p.m. until   
 3.30 p.m. During lunchtimes and after 
 school some pupils would attend a     
 disco,play football, basketball,      
 rehearse drama,stay in detention,go to
 the computer club...                  </content>
