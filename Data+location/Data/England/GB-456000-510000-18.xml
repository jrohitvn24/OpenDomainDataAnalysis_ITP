 The Library is situated in the High   
 Street.The Building used to be the    
 British School built in 1846.The      
 school sign can still be seen in the  
 Car Park at the rear of the Library.  
 Above the front door is the Yorkshire 
 Rose and the date 1969.This happens to
 be the date that the  building became 
 a Library.                            
         {The Old Pump                 
 The Old Pump on the High Green was    
 built in 1880.It was made originally  
 out of stone until it was destroyed   
 and rebuilt with wood.The Pump is     
 therefore only a replica.The trough is
 still there for people to look at.The 
 present pump was made by{J.R.BAINES.} 
 Any visitors to Great Ayton should    
 take the time to look at the village  
 pump.You never know{CAPTAIN COOK}may  
 have used it when he was a boy! {     </content>
