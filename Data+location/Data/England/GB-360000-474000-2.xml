		<title>02Farming _ Leck area</title>
		<content> In the 18th century land was enclosed 
 by walls and hedges and formed the    
 farms we now know.Because of the      
 contours of the land and the high rain
 fall farming patterns have changed    
 very little.There has always been     
 mixed farming i.e.dairy cows, beef,   
 rearing young stock and sheep.        
    Changes due to mechanisation have  
 made the most impact on farming. Once 
 upon a time work was done by horses   
 and many more men were employed on    
 farms. Now we have a lot more farm    
 implements and not as many farm       
 workers. Farms in our area are mainly 
 family farms run by fathers and sons. 
 Before, farms made mainly hay but now 
 they make more silage. Dairy cows are 
 now loose-housed but they used to be  
 tied up and they are now milked in a  
 milking parlour, not by hand.
