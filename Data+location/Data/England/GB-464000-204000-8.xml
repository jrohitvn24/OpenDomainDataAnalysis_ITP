		<content>At Shabbington we saw many Emperor     
dragonflies and at Ickford Green Lestes
and Hawkers.At Ickford it was very hard
to get to the water,and very muddy.A   
water and mud sample had in it-river   
worm,water louse,pond snails,and a     
damsel nymph.It was quiet and breezy,  
we heard ripples,rustles,shovelling and
swishing sounds.There are two hump-    
backed bridges over the river which are
narrow with spaces to stand out of the 
way of traffic.The road over these     
bridges is very busy.Once a year there 
is a tug-of-war across the bridges and 
morris dancing.Next to the bridges is a
{30ft pond which has never dried       
up},and an earthworks which is where   
Oliver Cromwell put cannon.The pond    
had duck- weed and flowering water     
lilies on the top and willows grow all 
along the riverside.On the bridge is   
carved 1685,it is a county boundary.   </content>
