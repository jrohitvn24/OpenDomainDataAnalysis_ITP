		<title>06TAKELEY, THE SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Takeley School is situated in         
 Roseacres; it was built in 1964 as a  
 temporary school but we are still     
 using it in 1985.  The building is in 
 a bad state of repair.  There are 7   
 classrooms, a visual aids room where  
 we watch television, a hall where we  
 have P.E. and outside there is a      
 swimming pool, two playgrounds and a  
 field.  There are 209 pupils in our   
 school, we have 7 teachers and our    
 headmaster is Mr Harris.  We also have
 some parents who come in to help.     
 There is 1 secretary, 4 mid day       
 assistants, 2 cooks, 2 cleaners and a 
 caretaker.  18% of the children have  
 school dinners, 77% have sandwiches   
 and 5% go home.  We have a selection  
 of school pets.  We have 2 BBC        
 computers and so we are able to take  
 part in the Domesday project.
