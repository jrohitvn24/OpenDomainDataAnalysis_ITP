		<title>14The Sports Club. N.Runcton.</title>
		<content>  There is a private sports club with  
 extensive playing fields and its own  
 clubhouse at North Runcton.{Hockey,   
{Cricket,}and{tennis}are played there. 
  The club is the leading sports club  
 in{West Norfolk}and most of its       
 members are from outside the village, 
 particularly from Kings Lynn. There   
 are about 150 hockey playing members, 
 about 150 tennis players, and about 50
 cricketers. Only about 25 members live
 in the village but any villager can   
 use the club's facilities on a        
 wednesday evening.                    
  The club employs a cleaner, a        
 groundsman, and a tea-lady, each of   
 whom live in the village.             
  The club was set up at North         
 Runcton,rather than elsewhere in West 
 Norfolk simply because there was a    
 suitable field available there.
