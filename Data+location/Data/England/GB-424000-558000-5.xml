		<title>05GATESHEAD: TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> Most of the main roads run in a       
 north/south direction. The major road 
 is the A6127, formerly the A1, Great  
 North Road. It runs from the A1(M)    
 through to Newcastle. Heavy vehicles  
 are not supposed to travel North on   
 this road. A new road intersection is 
 being built in the South-West, on     
 the Western By-pass which takes       
 traffic away from the centre of       
 Gateshead. The main bus services in   
 the area also follow a N/S direction, 
 with the E/W routes being covered     
 infrequently. Due to the type of area 
 and road network, cars are by far the 
 greatest form of transport used. There
 are six petrol filling stations along 
 the A1627 alone. The main London to   
 Newcastle railway runs along the West 
 side. Low Fell station is no longer   
 used.There are no waterways in the    
 area.                                 </content>
