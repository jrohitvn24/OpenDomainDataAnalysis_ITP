 A long time ago King Henrylll granted 
 Midsomer Norton the right to hold a 2 
 day cattle fair.The High Street was   
 lined with cattle pens and there were 
 stalls and fairground rides.All       
 children had a 2 day holiday.Through  
 the years the fair has changed.There  
 are galloping horses,helta-skelta     
 and roundabouts-much quicker and more 
 dangerous.Today the fair is held in a 
 field and not the High Street.The Fete
 andannual Flower Show was held in the 
 meadow where the Somervale            
 Comprehensive is now sited.It was     
 always on the first Saterday in       
 September.Bands would play and        
 different Societies would parade in   
 their regalia.Our main fair today is  
 our Carnival,with floats from all the 
 surrounding towns.
