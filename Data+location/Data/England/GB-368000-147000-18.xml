		<title>18Leigh on Mendip main street.</title>
		<content>   The older children of Leigh on      
 Mendip school went for a walk through 
 the village. We started from the east 
 end opposite our school. Down a road  
 to the left is the old 16th century   
 vicarage and an Elizabethan farmhouse.
 Opposite the school is a derelict     
 sawmill. It used to make handles for  
 spades and other hand tools. On the   
 north side, next to St Gile's church, 
 are some modernised cottages that used
 to be used by pilgrims to Glastonbury 
 .                                     
   Most of the houses are on the south 
 of the road and many were originally  
 two or three small cottages. At the   
 west end of the village is the post   
 office and stores. There is one other 
 grocery shop. There are four farms in 
 the village.
