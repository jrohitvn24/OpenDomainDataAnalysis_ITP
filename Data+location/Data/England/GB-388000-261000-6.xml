		<content>{Motorway Closure}_The M5 motorway     
 which runs to the East of Droitwich   
 linking our industry and commerce with
 the rest of the motorway system is to 
 be widened.Built in the early 1960s   
 with only 4 lanes it is to be         
 developed to six lanes.Firstly, it has
 to be lit to facilitate the work. Next
 the bridges and interchanges will be  
 widened or altered before the actual  
 widening process begins causing many  
 hold-ups and diversions for the next  
 3_5 years.                            
{Droitwich Festival}_ an Arts festival 
 first held in June 1985 to include    
 concerts,shows and                    
 exhibitions,pavement artists,magic and
 BMX racing.It also attracted some     
 'fringe' events and,following its     
 success,it is hoped it will become a  
 biennial event.The festival is        
 organised by Droitwich Town Council.  </content>
