		<content> On Saturday we went to the fete and me
 and Mrs Wheeler talked to a policeman 
 and I said is the Police Station still
 being used and he said yes but it is  
 only being used as an office.Outside  
 the station door it has an emergency  
 telephone that connects immediately to
 Uttoxeter Police Station. The         
 policeman in his van has to look after
 several villages.                     
 A fireman came to talk to us about his
 job. He had been a fireman 14 years.  
 At Abbots Bromley they have nine      
 retained men altogether. They have to 
 live within 1 mile of the village.    
 They have 1 fire engine. There are    
 about 5O fires during 1 year. The fire
 engine is 8 yrs. old. They clean the  
 engine as soon as they have put out a 
 fire. In an emergency ambulances come 
 from Uttoxeter. Our nearest hospital  
 is in Burton-on-Trent.                </content>
