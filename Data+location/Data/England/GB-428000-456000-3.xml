		<title>03BILTON WITH HARROGATE</title>
		<content>    On the map of 1897 Bilton and      
 Harrogate are shown as entirely       
 seperate places, with fields between  
 the two villages. Bilton itself was   
 recorded in the Domesday Book of      
 William I as{Bileton,}half of it owned
 by a Northumbrian called Gamelbar, the
 other half by another Northumbrian    
 called Archill. The River Nidd and{   
{Bilton Beck}are also mentioned.       
    In 1851 Bilton was two small       
 communities, Batchelor Gardens and    
 Bilton village. St. John's Church was 
 built in 1857 as Bilton expanded, but 
 even in 1864 the district was still   
 known as{Bilton with Harrogate.}By    
 1871 Bilton was recorded as the most  
 thinly populated part of the township 
 of Harrogate.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
