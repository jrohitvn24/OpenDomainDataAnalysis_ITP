		<title>01Upper Ebble and Beyond</title>
		<content> The Ebble flowing, basically, from    
 east to west, is bounded by chalk     
 downlands which rise in the north bank
 a hundred metres above it. There, deep
 but dry valleys incise the downs      
 roughly at right angles to the bourn. 
 In the extreme north west the high    
 ground falls away sharply.            
 To south of the Ebble,the land rises  
 less dramatically, though Windmill    
 Hill and Barrow Hill are notable      
 heights.                              
                                       
 Both Ebbesbourne Wake and Alvediston  
 were developed during and since       
 Victorian times. However, a few       
 cottages retain the charm of an       
 earlier period.                       
 Because the two villages are small and
 remote, there is a lively community   
 spirit, but the populations are       
 ageing.                               </content>
