		<title>04SCHOOLS IN LEEK</title>
		<content>Leek schools have been divided into    
three stages since 1980.The first      
schools for five-nine year olds feed   
the 2 Middle schools(9-13 years)which  
in turn feed 2 High Schools.When Leek  
changed one or two small schools were  
closed  like St James at Longsdon which
now stands empty.The Brittania street  
school in Leek is now used as a Gym    
called the Body Shop.West Street       
School is now part of the local        
College. Our school is Leek St         
Edward's C.E(A)   Middle School which  
is a part of the old   Leek High       
premises at Warrington Hall.There are  
590 pupils in our school.
