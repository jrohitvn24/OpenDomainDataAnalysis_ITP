		<title>14CUBS AND BROWNIES, THWAITES</title>
		<content> Late in 1984 both Cub Scout and       
 Brownie Guide Packs were reformed in  
 Thwaites Parish after a lapse of many 
 years. Two local ladies are Akela and 
 Chil for the Cubs, and two others are 
 Brown Owl and Snowy Owl for the       
 Brownies. The meetings are held in The
 Green Village Hall once a week. Twelve
 girls go to Brownies and fourteen boys
 to Cubs. In February 1985 the Cubs and
 Brownies held a joint coffee morning  
 in Millom, (the nearest town) to raise
 funds. Both Cubs and Brownies enjoy   
 playing games, working towards badges,
 going for walks and on expeditions.   
 They are organised in sixes for team  
 games and general organisation. The   
 Brownie sixes are Gnomes, Sprites and 
 Pixies and the Cub sixes are Blue.    
 Yellow and Green. All the children say
 they enjoy going to meetings.
