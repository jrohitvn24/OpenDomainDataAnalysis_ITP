		<title>10    An Ordinary Day</title>
		<content>    I get up at 7.30am for school which
 is at 9.00am.I have some cereal for my
 breakfast. When I arrive at school I  
 have a game of football with my       
 friends in the yard.                  
    When we come into school we go to  
 assembly followed by English or       
 Mathematics until we have break at    
 10.25am. After break we have English  
 or Mathematics again until lunch time 
 at 12.00pm. We choose what we want    
 from the canteen. The choice is       
 extensive. After our meal we play     
 outside for a forty five minute break.
    In the afternoon we have options.  
 This includes sewing,woodwork or      
 cooking until hometime.               
    When I get home I have some tea.   
 Then most evenings I play football    
 which is my favourite sport. Bedtime  
 is about 10.00pm.
