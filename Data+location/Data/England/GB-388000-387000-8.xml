		<title>08EDGELEY SHOPPING PRECINCT</title>
		<content> In{Edgeley}we have our own shopping   
 precinct. In the Precinct there are 64
 different kinds of shops selling a    
 great variety of things for us to buy.
 Most of the shopping area is          
 pedestrianised to make it safe and    
 pleasant for the people who use it.   
 During the summer the precinct blooms 
 with pretty flowers in hanging baskets
 Specially built flower beds make the  
 area a beautiful and enjoyable place  
 to shop in. Lots of people visit the  
 shopping area from miles around and it
 is especially busy on Fridays and     
 Saturdays. It half-day closing on     
 Wednesday. Because of the hooligans   
 shop-keepers put bars over the windows
 and doors at night. We are lucky in   
 Edgeley in having such a good shopping
 precinct because it means that people 
 can shop near to home and need not    
 travel to the town centre.            </content>
