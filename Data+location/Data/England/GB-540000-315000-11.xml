		<title>11SHOPPING (continued)</title>
		<content>    The Post Office sells stationery   
 items more than anything else apart   
 from stamps.About 100 people a day    
 come to the Post Office.The Fosters   
 own the shop now and they came to the 
 village from Fiji.The house behind the
 shop used to be a girls school 300    
 years ago, before we had a proper     
 school.                               
    We have a mobile fish and chip van 
 which comes once a week.You might say,
 "Fish and chips on wheels."           
   Many things which people need cannot
 be bought in our village shops, and   
 people have to go to towns like       
 Wisbech or Peterborough to buy        
 goods such as clothes,furniture and   
 electrical goods.Some people travel by
 bus,but as there are not many         
 buses,mostly people travel by car.
