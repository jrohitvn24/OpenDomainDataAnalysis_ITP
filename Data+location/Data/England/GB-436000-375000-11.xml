		<content>  Mr. William Marshall, age 52, former 
 professional football player, now pig 
 farmer.                               
  "Father-in-law bought old colliery   
 buildings in 1940, &amp; set up farm.Only 
 3 of original buildings left, coke    
 ovens, b/smith's shop &amp; engine house, 
 all now listed buildings.             
  "50-60 sows &amp; about 500 fat pigs.Till
 1984, contracted to supply Walls, at  
 Hyde, Manchester. Used to take bakery 
 waste from Gunstone's, at Dronfield.  
 Now raising different kind of smaller 
 pig. At 160 lbs. sent for butchering. 
  "Two men employed; cleaning out most 
 of mornings. New pit for slurry, which
 farmers spread on fields. Muck a      
 problem; chemical fertilizers lowered 
 demand. Some used on local allotments.
  "Pig trade not very good. Need to    
 increase breeding stock to 80 so that 
 we do not have to buy in.Future poor."</content>
