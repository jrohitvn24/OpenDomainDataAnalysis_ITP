		<content>{Reminiscences of a lady who has lived 
{all her life in a house on Ashdown    
{Forest.                               
   Chuck Hatch, a gateway to Ashdown   
 Forest, was in the early part of this 
 century a secluded little hamlet.     
 In 1985 it is very different -traffic 
 speeds through and aeroplanes roar    
 overhead. Changes noted include:-     
 1. Erection of letter box in the reign
 of Edward VII.                        
 2. Bus service started in 1929 and    
 discontinued in 1930.                 
 3. Water main laid in 1938 until then 
 water was fetched from a spring.      
 4. Electricity arrived in 1946        
 5. Chuck Hatch House, part of which   
 was a shop until 1920, was made into 3
 houses in 1963.                       
 6. Bread,milk and groceries were      
 delivered regularly but now only milk 
 is delivered every other day.         </content>
