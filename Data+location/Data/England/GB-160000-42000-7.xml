		<content> Many tourists come to this area to see
 the spactacular scenery.  It          
 encompasses some of the sheerest      
 cliffs and most rugged countryside.   
  The visitors to this area tend to    
 come from the more local holiday areas
 ie Hayle, Perranporth, St Ives.       
 Within an approximate 10 mile radius  
 of Hell's Mouth.                      
  To cater for the tourists there are  
 car-parks and a small cafe/shop.      
 There is a sign at Hell's Mouth       
 warning people of the sheer drop.     
  The majority of tourits will just    
 park and look at the view, though some
 will walk the coastal footpath.  There
 are also a few small caves which can  
 be reached, but these are hard to get 
 to.                                   
  Due to landslides, the cliff is      
 getting closer to the car-parks and   
 road all the time.                    </content>
