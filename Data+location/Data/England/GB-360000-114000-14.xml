		<title>14A FUTURE CONCERN, SHERBORNE</title>
		<content>  Farmers are facing a difficult time _
 animal fats are shunned by the diet-  
 conscious, EEC quotas are imposed to  
 limit over-production, borrowing is   
 expensive. Factory farming is more    
 efficient but is it humane?           
  About 40 million hens are kept 5 to a
 20 inch wide cage for egg production, 
 unable to spread their wings. About   
 500,000 sows stand throughout their   
 lives on cold concrete, 10,000 calves 
 are reared in narrow crates on slatted
 floors on liquid diet to keep their   
 flesh pale for the white veal trade.  
 Most male chicks are either gassed or 
 crushed when only 1 day old. The      
 scale of misery is massive.           
  Livestock are inefficient converters 
 of protein - peas and beans can prov_ 
 ide the same food value more cheaply  
 and if it can be made more appetising,
 can solve the world hunger problem.   </content>
