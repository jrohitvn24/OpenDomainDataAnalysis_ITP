		<content> Families here live much more comfort- 
 ably than they did a generation ago. A
 number of homes have central heating  
 but many retain open coal fires, some 
 still cooking on combination ranges.  
 Electricity, Calor (not North Sea) gas
 and oil are also used for cooking and 
 heating. Apart from a few outlying    
 dwellings,all houses have electric    
 light. Most have bathrooms, though    
 some still have outside  toilets.     
 Nearly all homes have television and  
 washing machines and many have        
 refrigerators and freezers. Most fam- 
 ilies still dry their clothes outside.
 Home baking is general and jam and    
 wine are also made at home. Houses are
 comfortably furnished, often with     
 fitted carpets, though prodded mats   
 and hooky rugs are still to be found. 
 Most households have a dog, a cat or  
 both.                                 </content>
