		<content>     We looked at the local papers for 
 the second half of June 1985 to see   
 what were the main local,national and 
 international concerns.               
       There was much local concern    
 about the fire at the Bradford City   
 Football Club Ground which killed so  
 many people.This has given rise to    
 national worries about other grounds  
 and stands which may be in a similar  
 condition.                            
       Hooliganism at football grounds 
 is also an area of concern at all     
 three levels.The deaths of 38 people  
 at the Heysel Stadium in Brussels has 
 given rise to much consideration of   
 what should be done.                  
       The hijacking of an aircraft at 
 Beirut airport by Muslim gunmen and   
 the explosion of the Air india        
 airliner over the Atlantic have also  
 occupied a lot of space in the press. </content>
