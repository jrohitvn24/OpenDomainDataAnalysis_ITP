		<title>08Glapthorn Church</title>
		<content>In Glapthorn Church there are five     
buttresses and there is a coffin       
carriage which they used in the olden  
days.  There are many traces of wall   
paintings in the Church and the        
clearest one is of St. Christopher. The
Church Plate consists of a chalice.    
There are 51 windows in our church.    
The church was small once because in   
the church there are curved windows and
pointed ones.  Some windows are tall in
the church and some are small.   There 
are three bells in the church.
