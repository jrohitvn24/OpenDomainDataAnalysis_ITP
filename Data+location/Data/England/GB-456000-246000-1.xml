		<content> Sometimes described as the forgotten  
 villages of Northamptonshire, this is 
 a largely unspoilt rural area.  The   
 low population numbers are likely to  
 remain with only 'in-filling' building
 allowed.  Agriculture &amp; farming       
 interests predominate{(3-7).          
 Conservation &amp; preservation of our    
 heritage are major interests{(8-10)}; 
 many houses are listed buildigs{(15)}.
 Increasingly people are choosing to   
 live in the area{(16)}.  diversifying 
 community interests.  There is a      
 decline however in many services.  No 
 shops, poor transport &amp; health care   
 are increasing problems with an ageing
 population{(18)}.  The natives are    
 friendly &amp; caring, actively           
 participating in local events{(11-14)}
 Low unemployment{(17)}, little crime &amp;
 the pleasant, peaceful surroundings   
 making it an attractive place to live.</content>
