		<content>    The next oldest house we saw was an
 early twentieth century semi_detached 
 with pebble dash on the wall, and a   
 slate roof.We also saw some           
 semi_detached council houses which    
 were built in the 1950s.They were     
 built in brick with red tiled roofs.  
   We saw some large semi_detached     
 private housing.They were built with  
 red bricks and red tiled roofs.They   
 have large bay windows and they were  
 built in the mid  twentieth century.  
 There are alot of bunglows in Rowlands
 Gill. Rowlands Gill is in the         
 South_East of our block.              
   There was alot of modern            
 semi_detached houses in Fellside Park.
 They have all been built in the past  
 five years.They are still building on 
 this estate.
