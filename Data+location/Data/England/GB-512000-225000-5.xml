		<title>05A DAY IN MY LIFE:EMMA BROWN.</title>
		<content>  6.00 a.m.!  I reach out for the cord 
 next to my bed to turn the light on.I 
 read a book till 6.30 when I get up.  
 I climb sleepily out of bed and draw  
 my curtains, get dressed in my riding 
 clothes, go downstairs and get the    
 keys out of the kitchen cupboard. Then
 I go out to the stable and get Elly's 
 headcollar and rope, go to the paddock
 and get Elly, who is my pony. I groom 
 her and tack her up and then take her 
 for a half-hour ride up one of the    
 bridle paths. When I get back I untack
 Elly and turn her out in the paddock  
 and feed her. I lock my tack in the   
 garage and run back into the pub where
 I live. I have my breakfast - normally
 fried bread and sausages - and get    
 ready for school. "HELP MUM!, have you
 seen my other plimsoll or my reading  
 record or, for that matter, my school-
 bag and coat?"                        </content>
