		<title>04A COMMUNITY PROJECT</title>
		<content> A piece of land has been given to the 
 local community in{Cotmanhay}by the   
{Erewash Borough Council.}Local people 
 are clearing the land so that they can
 build a{B.M.X.track}and{two adventure 
{playgrounds.}Later a{nature reserve}  
 will be developed around a pond.      
 Trees, bushes and shrubs will be      
 planted and the area will hopefully   
 attract a variety of wildlife. There  
 will also be a{picnic area} on the    
 site.                                 
{Local schools}are helping to plan the 
 project and later children will help  
 to build it.                          
 The total cost of the project will be 
{Â£19,000.}The money is being raised by 
 the organisers through different fund 
 raising activities.                   
 It is hoped that the first part of the
 project will be completed by the end  
 of 1985.                              </content>
