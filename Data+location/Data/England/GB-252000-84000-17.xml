		<content>   The Ten Tors walk is an annual event
 on Dartmoor. The walk starts from     
 Oakhampton Camp and will traverse ten 
 of the tors of Dartmoor.              
   The walk started in 1960. There are 
 three possible routes walked dependent
 upon the experience of the walkers.   
 These are 35, 45, or 55 miles. This   
 year 1985 there were 2500 entrants,   
 and 150 disabled entrants. The walkers
 move in teams, the size of the team   
 being usually 6 to 8.                 
   One route this year was Sowerton    
 Tor, Kitty Tor, Lynch Tor, Beardown   
 Tor, South Hessary Tor, Trowlsworthy  
 Tor, Hartor Tor. That was day one, and
 ended with an overnight camp.         
   The second day took in Combesdown   
 Tor, Sitterford Tor, and Steeperton   
 Tor.                                  
   The Ten Tors is a considerable      
 challange for young people.           </content>
