		<title>15PARACHUTING - THE OBJECTIONS</title>
		<content>   Objections from locals are based on 
 the level and type of noise produced  
 by the aircraft as parachutists are   
 ferried into the air with monotonous  
 regularity. The constant drone, at an 
 irritating pitch, takes place mostly  
 at week-ends when people wish to relax
 in their gardens.                     
   Some farmers have also been affected
 by helmets, metal objects and stray   
 parachutists dropping onto their      
 fields.  Many locals are also         
 concerned about the adverse effect    
 this may be having on the value of    
 their property.                       
   Having chosen to live in such a     
 quiet, unspoilt part of the country,  
 many consider it very unfair that     
 so many people must suffer such an    
 intrusion just for the casual pleasure
 of a handful of people, many of whom  
 do not even live in the county.       </content>
