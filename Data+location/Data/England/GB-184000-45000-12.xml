		<title>12Changes in Tresillian (2)</title>
		<content> Religion has also changed.In 1945 many
 people went to church on Sundays, but 
 nowadays there has been a slow decline
 in people going to church.            
  The change that might occur soon is  
 the council building a by-pass round  
 Tresillian to cater for the extra     
 traffic going in and out of Truro.    
  It is highly suprising to know that  
 there were no street lamps in         
 Tresillian village until 1968!        
  Most services have improved although 
 shops are very few in Tresillian and  
 this situation seems to be getting    
 worse as the post office may close    
 soon.Most villagers are not worried   
 about this because they think having  
 more shops in Tresillian would spoil  
 its unique beauty.
