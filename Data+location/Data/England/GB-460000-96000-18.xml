		<content>      In our area there are mostly     
 detached houses,although some newer   
 flats have been built in the last few 
 years.  The Children's Home has been  
 sold and a new development comprising 
 of 70 new homes will be built. The    
 wardens house(which is about 200 years
 old) is still left standing and       
 someone is going to buy it).          
      Some of the very  large houses   
 have  been turned into other          
 buildings,such as Mary Court school,a 
 hospital and a nursing home. A huge   
 house in the Crescent has been        
 converted into a hotel and apartments.
      There are several "listed houses"
 in the village area which cannot be   
 altered without the councils          
 permission.
