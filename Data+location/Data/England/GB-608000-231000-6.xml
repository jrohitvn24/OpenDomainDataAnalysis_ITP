		<title>06Community work, Manningtree</title>
		<content> During the late 1970's and 1980's     
 pupils of Manningtree School have     
 built up a programme of work with the 
 handicapped, the elderly and the very 
 young which has been recognised by    
 awards for community work by National 
 Westminster Bank and the North East   
 Thames Regional Health Authority.     
 Groups of pupils have paid weekly     
 visits to the physically handicapped  
 residents of Jacques Hall (Bradfield) 
 and the mentally handicapped of       
 Brunswick House (Mistley), organising 
 activities for these residents, taking
 them on outings paid for by fund      
 raising events in the school. They    
 have helped to break down some of the 
 myths and fears that still tend to    
 isolate the mentally handicapped,     
 particularly, in the community by     
 befriending the residents.
