		<title>09The Dairy Industry</title>
		<content> The other problem concerns dairy      
 farming.  Since Britain is now in the 
 Common Market, farmers have to obey   
 laws which are made by the European   
 Parliament.  The Parliament noted that
 too much milk was being produced, more
 milk than people were buying.  This   
 meant that many dairy farmers had to  
 cut the size of their herds.  In other
 words valuable cows had to be killed. 
 A farmer who spent years breeding a   
 fine herd of cattle would be very     
 upset if ordered to destroy some of   
 his animals.  As the West country is a
 leading milk producing region the     
 farmers around Newton-St-Loe were     
 affected by the new law in 1985.      
 Animals had to be sold or killed if   
 the herd size was above the official  
 "quota".
