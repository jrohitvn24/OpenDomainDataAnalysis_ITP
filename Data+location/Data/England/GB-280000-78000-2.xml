		<content> This area is on the fringe of Dartmoor
 National park.Shaptor rock is a       
 granite out crop and a point of       
 geographical interest.We got a good   
 view of the fields from shaptor rock. 
 You go past Hawkmoor Hospital.There is
 a twisty path going up with lots of   
 brambles along it.It is a steep rock  
 and is very high but there are other  
 rocks higher on Dartmoor. We saw some 
 deciduous tree's such as silver birch 
 and oak. Most of the fields around are
 rough grazing.Part of the woods is    
 owned by the Woodland Trust.On top of 
 Shaptor Rock there are some gorse     
 bushes. There is also some heather.   
  Here in Bovey Tracey the weather is  
 quite mild but in the winter it is    
 very cold and snowy because we are    
 near to the moor's.It often snows in  
 Hennock.
