 An overriding concern in this Area and
 indeed in other areas of Great Britain
 is{vandalism}and general delinquency. 
 The Abbey has had its stained glass   
 broken, decorative features outside   
 the Abbey have been smashed and walls 
 are daubed with graffiti in many      
 public places.  There is national     
 concern about{Drugs}and Pershore does 
 have its small problems with youths   
{sniffing glue}and taking harder drugs.
{Marital breakdown}is quite common and 
 contributes to the unhappiness and    
 disillusionment felt by many in these 
 times.  There are no problems exper-  
 ienced with regard to colour          
 prejudice.  Coloured families are     
 rare.  Pershore looks after its old   
 people particularly well - with       
 special care homes and community      
 centres and clubs.                    </content>
