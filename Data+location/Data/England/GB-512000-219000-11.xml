		<title>11Tidy Tip</title>
		<content>                                       
 The Tidy Tip was started in January   
 1979,two men are being employed and   
 work from 9.30am to 8.00pm.It cost    
 Â£84,000 to start and Â£1,000 to Â£1,500 
 to run a week.Before the tidy tip was 
 started it was waste land.No computers
 help the men with their   work but    
 sometimes they use them to count how  
 many vehicles come in and out of the  
 Tidy Tip.1,400 people use the Tidy Tip
 every day which would fill            
 approximately 13 containers.Four      
 trucks come a day so there would be   
 some containers waiting all the       
 time.Facilities haven't been updated  
 since it started apart from           
 replacement of some rubbish containers
 .In the summer the most popular       
 rubbish is garden refuse.
