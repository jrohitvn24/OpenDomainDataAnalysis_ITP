		<title>17The River Trent Collingham</title>
		<content> One of the most dangerous rivers in   
 Britain because of its treacherous    
 currents,it also contains some of the 
 best{fishing }for miles around.The    
 river was once very badly polluted,   
 but after a clean up campaign,even    
 salmon are sometimes seen.The         
 fishermen and the herons are disturbed
 only by the occasional pleasure craft,
 for the commercial traffic is no more.
 In the last century,prior to the      
 coming of the railways,heavy barges   
 were much in evidence."The Jolly      
 Bargeman",once a busy riverside pub   
 and staging point for horses is now a 
 childrens holiday home.               
{Cromwell Lock }is the tidal limit of  
 the River Trent,being manned 24 hours 
 daily.Nearby is a memorial stone to 10
 soldiers of the 131st Independent     
 Parachute Regiment who were drowned in
 September 1975 in the notorious{oven. </content>
