		<title>01Wroxall and its surroundings</title>
		<content> In the south of the Isle of Wight,    
 chalk downs 200 metres high dominate  
 the block, sloping steeply into the   
 Wroxall valley in the East and more   
 gently to the Yar valley in the West. 
 Predominantly agricultural,the varied 
 soils facilitate rough grazing for    
 sheep,dairy farming and arable crops. 
  Wroxall is the largest settlement    
 with a Post Office,2 pubs,restaurant  
 tea-shop,several shops and 2 churches.
 There is a caravan site nd the area is
 well served with footpaths.           
  Although "Warochesselle" was a Manor 
 in Domesday Book and the 17th Century 
 Appuldurcombe House stands on the     
 ruins of a 13th C. Abbey,most of the  
 village is relatively modern. Much    
 building took place after the arrival 
 of the railway in 1866 and since 1975 
 a housing estate,Community Centre and 
 a new Primary School have been built. </content>
