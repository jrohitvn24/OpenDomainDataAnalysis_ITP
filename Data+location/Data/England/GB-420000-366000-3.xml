		<title>03The Market</title>
		<content>   Bakewell Market is held every Monday
 including{Bank Holidays.  }In fact the
 market takes up more space than normal
 on Bank Holidays.                     
   Stalls sell  all  sorts  of  things,
 like vegetables, sweets,  meat,  toys,
 clothes, wool,  shoes,  carpets, pots,
 ornaments, glasses, jewellry, material
 and books. It is a noisy place. Stall-
 holders shout out  the  prices  of the
 articles they are selling.   Sometimes
 buskers  play  music and that  adds to
 the  noise.   Customers  chatter away.
 There's also the noise from the{Cattle
{Market,}where sheep,  and occasionally
 pigs  and  goats  are  sold as well as
 cattle.                               
   The  market  starts at about 9am and
 is  over  by  about  4pm.   As you can
 imagine, it's a very  messy and smelly
 place by the time it's all over.
