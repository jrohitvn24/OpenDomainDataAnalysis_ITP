 buildings on Aylestone Campus but     
 there are a number of annexes, many   
 occupying  large houses which are     
 typical of the area.                  
    There are five main departments -  
 Building, Catering, Commerce,         
 Engineering, Science and Mathematics. 
    A wide variety of courses are      
 offered, from GCE O and A levels to   
 farming. Links with the Agricultural  
 and Art Colleges ensure a very wide   
 syllabus range suiting the majority of
 students whatever their interests.    
    The Technical College also offers a
 wide range of evening classes and     
 these are attended by many local      
 people of all ages.
