		<title>07Horticulture in Rookley</title>
		<content>{Andrew Lord writes:}When my grandad   
 retired from Pidford Farm last October
 he let my Uncle Artie have the 5-acre 
 field behind our houses in Rookley for
 horticulture. The soil is medium to   
 heavy loam, 9" top soil, 6" sub-soil, 
 and then a thin layer of gravel on    
 clay. First he drained the land with  
 4"pipes to break the pan (hard layer).
 Then he ploughed the whole field. Next
 he turned it with a cultivator. Straw-
 berries (different varieties - varied 
 cropping) broad beans, and raspberries
 were planted on 1 acre. Uncle grassed 
 a small paddock for sheep grazing and 
 ponies and a car park. He gave a small
 piece to us and my Dad built a stable.
 The remainder was cultivated in spring
 after the frost and new potatoes were 
 dug in June. Passers-by can buy our   
 fruit and vegetables from a roadside  
 stall just as you drive into Rookley. </content>
