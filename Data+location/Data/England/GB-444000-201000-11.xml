		<title>11Wootton Parish Council</title>
		<content>    Wootton is a large village of about
 3000  inhabitants. The chairman of the
 Parish  Council told us that they have
 a budget of Â£10000. About half of this
 is  spent  on street lighting.  20-25%
 goes  on administration costs, and the
 rest  is  used to improve amenities in
 the village. Eleven Parish Councillors
 are  elected every four years. Usually
 the  election is not contested, it can
 be  difficult to find people to serve.
 The Council meets on the first Tuesday
 of  every  month  and the first twenty
 minutes  are  given up to listening to
 people's concerns.  The Parish Council
 has  had  complaints  about litter and
 hooliganism  and  has  been  asked  to
 provide {sleeping  policemen} in  some
 roads  to  slow down the traffic.  One
 of  the  Parish Council's main jobs is
 to present local needs to the District
 and County Councils.                  </content>
