		<title>02The Battle Of Huntingdon</title>
		<content>  The class and I visited the town     
 trail where the Battle of Huntingdon  
 took place. All the Parliamentarians  
 were waiting at the River Ouse Bridge 
 for the cavaliers to attack, but the  
 only problem was the cavaliers        
 attacked from the opposite side from  
 ST Andrews Bridge. (Near Hodsons chip 
 shop.)                                
   There might have been a soldier on  
 lookout who warned the ironsides so   
 the ironsides had to gather up their  
 weapons and march through the deserted
 High Street to St Andrews Bridge .    
   After fighting at St Andrews Bridge 
 (Near Hodsons chip shop) the  ironside
 retreated to   (ST Johns  graveyard)  
 Fierce fighting went on for about an  
 hour. After the fighting at ST Johns  
 church, ST Johns  was filled with     
 smoke, flames and bodies. (ST Johns   
 graveyard )  The Cavaliesrs won.      </content>
