 Mr Perkin. Mr Perkin lives next to the
 school. He mainly grows strawberries  
 and raspberries and radishes. Nobody  
 works for him but his wife helps him  
 pick the plants and things.He has a   
 stall on Chesterfield market where he 
 sells these and other produce during  
 the week.He does not water his plants 
 often and he gets his manure from his 
 milk man.He has got one large green   
 house and does not have a lot of      
 trouble from insects or pests.Mr      
 Perkin goes to look at his plants     
 every day depending on the weather.   
 Mr Perkin says he started market      
 gardening as his hobby when he was 9  
 or 10. He has not been on hoilday for 
 a long time but when he does go on    
 holiday his daughter looks after the  
 garden.
