  In 1984, Mr George Riley's booklet   
'Five Walks around Madeley' was publi- 
shed. It demonstrates the variety and  
interest there is in walking as a major
recreational activity. All of the walks
begin near to Madeley Church. The walks
vary in length from 4 to 7 miles with  
never more than 1.5 miles of road walk-
ing. Most of the walks are across      
fields, sometimes revealing old foot-  
paths or a wagon track from 100 years  
in the past. The walks are across some 
very attractive countryside, with some 
superb views. There are other public   
rights of way in the area, but these   
are good examples. Some of the places  
that can be reached by using the guide 
include the villages of Aston, Baldwins
Gate, Betley, Onneley and Keele and the
M6 Motorway. Quite a lot of village    
pubs could provide refreshments.       </content>
