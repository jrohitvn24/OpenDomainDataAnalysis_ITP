		<title>12FISHING CENSUS ON THE NENE 1</title>
		<content>                JULY 1985              
                                       
   We arrived in Wadenhoe after an     
 exhausting bike ride. After a brief   
 rest we set up our tackle and began to
 fish. We waited and waited, and waited
 a little longer, until at last we got 
 lucky and had a bite (hooray!).The    
 first fish we caught was a 3lb 2oz    
 bream. This inspired us to continue.  
 Luck seemed on our side as the fish   
 continued to bite, after the first    
 bream came roach, carp, dace, gudgeon 
 and another bream. After carefully    
 placing the fish back into the river  
 we packed up our tackle and wrote up  
 our notes.                            
   Finally we cycled home feeling much 
 the worse for wear.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
