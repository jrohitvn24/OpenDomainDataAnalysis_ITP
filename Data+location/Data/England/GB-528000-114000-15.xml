		<title>15Housing development</title>
		<content>  Hassocks is surrounded by farmland   
 with some ribbon development along {  
{Ockley Lane}and some 1930's built     
 housing along{Ockley Way, Manor       
{Avenue, Mackie Avenue}and some down{  
{Grand Avenue.}                        
  The general style is of low, squat   
 bungalows with some terraced bungalows
 and a few normal, two storey houses.  
 While appearing small from the outside
 some of these bungalows are very roomy
 internally. They are quite pleasant   
 to look at and most have large back   
 and front gardens.                    
{ Ockley Manor}was obviously built at  
 the centre of a thriving farming      
 community but its lands have been     
 slowly nibbled away at the southern   
 end by new housing developments. Now  
 it is only 100 metres away from the   
 northern end of{Mackie Avenue.}
