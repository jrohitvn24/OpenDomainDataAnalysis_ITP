		<title>08Wave Reflection Wall 3.</title>
		<content> If the wall had been straight the     
 water would have eventually eroded it 
 with continual battering. The wall is 
 designed to prevent approximately 70% 
 of the flooding experienced in 1977.  
 In order to stop flooding completely  
 the wall would have had to have been a
 lot higher than it is. This was not   
 possible as it would have led to the  
 spectacular views across the bay being
 lost. Some people argue that this has 
 happened. When the new wall was first 
 suggested press reports quoted        
 residents calling the wall a 'concrete
 monstrosity'. But according to press  
 reports after the 1983 floods,        
 residents who were continually        
 suffering through the floods welcomed 
 the wall. The wall proved to be       
 effective when put to the test in     
 1983.
