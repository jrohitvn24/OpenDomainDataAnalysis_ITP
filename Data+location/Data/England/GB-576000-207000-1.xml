		<title>01LITTLE BADDOW VILLAGE</title>
		<content>   Little Baddow is a small rural      
 village approximately 15km east of    
 Chelmsford in Essex. There is evidence
 from the Domesday Book that Little    
 Baddow was a prosperous farming       
 community. Before 1066 it was owned by
 Leofwin but after the Conquest William
 I saw fit to divide the area into two 
 parts which were held by Lambert and  
 Germund and were worth Â£6 each.       
   Since Norman times the economy of   
 the village has changed little, its   
 wealth is still in the land, which is 
 now used for arable farming. Much of  
 the decidious woodland areas remain.  
   The village is sited on the rise of 
 a small hill at about 75m above sea   
 level. The settlement follows a linear
 pattern stretching for 1km. The       
 population of Little Baddow in 1985   
 was approximately 2000.
