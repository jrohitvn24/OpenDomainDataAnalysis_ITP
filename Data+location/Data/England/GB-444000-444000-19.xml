		<title>19   ADVENTURE PLAYGROUND</title>
		<content>      This super exciting playground is
 the best play area for miles around   
 and it is free. The playground        
 is provided so that shopper's children
 can play instead of hanging around mum
 and dad.                              
                                       
      In the playground there is a     
 magnificent pirate ship which is big  
 enough for a 100 children. There is a 
 real looking army tank and an army    
 truck. One frame that looks like a    
 rugby ball is fun but it can be       
 frightening and dangerous. There are  
 the usual activities like slides,     
 swings and tractor tyres. The most    
 thrilling activities are the most     
 dangerous ones.                       
                                       
      In the week the playground is    
 deserted but at the week end it is    
 absolutely packed.                    </content>
