		<content> About  one third of the group attended
 a club once or twice a week.  These   
 were children's clubs, e.g. Boys and  
 and Girls Brigade, Cubs ,Brownies.    
 Very few attend clubs as a family and 
 only 3 families took their children to
 a social club.                        
                                       
            SPORT                      
                                       
 More than half played sport e.g.      
 football, golf, snooker, cricket,     
 judo, karate, running, pool, rowing,  
 swimming, bowls, squash.  Of these by 
 far the most important sport is       
 football.   Very many more people take
 part in sport than spend leisure time 
 watching.  More people travel to watch
 football than any other sport.  The   
 only sport which people travel to see
