		<content>The Carter Institute-the Village Hall- 
is the centre of village social activi-
ties. An extension is being built, paid
for by village fund-raising, using the 
Manpower Services Commission for       
economy; this will give an enlarged    
kitchen and improved toilet facilities.
The Hall is used for Club meetings,fund
raising events, for discos and bingo, &amp;
can be hired cheaply for private cele- 
brations.  Barn Dances are popular, and
in good weather, these are held in a   
local large garden. The Victorian      
Church of St Peter has been used most  
effectively recently for a concert of  
music &amp; poetry and for seasonal presen-
tations by the children. For many, the 
local pub, the Lamb, is the natural    
place to gather to exchange village    
news and views. Food is served every   
day and there is a pleasant beer garden
with games facilities.                 </content>
