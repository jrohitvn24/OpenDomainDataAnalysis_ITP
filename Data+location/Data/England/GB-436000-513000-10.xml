		<title>10TEESSIDE AIRPORT SECURITY</title>
		<content>    Extra security measures have been  
 taken because of recent terrorist     
 attacks abroad (eg Beiruit airport,   
 June  l985).                          
                                       
    The{detection equipment}is as up   
 to date as possible. On all flights to
 Ireland, the Isle of Man and the      
 Channel Islands{,luggage is searched. 
 Passengers also have to provide       
 additional information for Special    
 Branch officers.                      
    As a final check, passengers also  
 have to{identify their luggage}on the 
 tarmac before boarding the plane. This
 not only makes sure that the luggage  
 is on the right plane but should stop 
 materials such as explosives being    
 added after the luggage has been      
 checked in.
