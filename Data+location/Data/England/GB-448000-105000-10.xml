		<content>  The pottery is called Overstone.Mrs. 
 Wilson has been a{potter}for          
 thirty-five years and has been at     
 Overstone for nineteen years.She buys 
 her clay from{Stoke on Trent}and a    
 kind dentist has given her some{dental
{tools}for using in the pottery.Pottery
 is made of earth shaped with the aid  
 of water,dried in air and made hard by
{fire.}All the{colours}and other things
 she needs come from the ground.She has
 a small shop where she sells her      
 pottery.She uses a{machine}to make the
 clay into a sausage shape.Her{pottery 
{wheel}runs by its self so she doesn't 
 have to use her feet.Her sister draws 
 the pictures on some of the plates.   
 About forty pieces are made every day.
