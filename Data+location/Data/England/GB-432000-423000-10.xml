		<content> DURING THE VICTORIAN ERA MINERS'      
 WELFARE CLUBS WERE ESTABLISHED AND    
 THESE EVOLVED INTO THE WORKING MEN'S  
 CLUBS OF TODAY TO BE FOUND THROUGHOUT 
 OUR AREA. FOUNDED AS SOCIAL CLUBS FOR 
 MEN WHERE BEER WAS CHEAP AND DOMINOES,
 DARTS AND BILLIARDS COULD BE PLAYED,  
 THEY NOW OFFER DANCING, BINGO AND     
 ENTERTAINMENT IN ADDITION AND HAVE    
 EXTENDED MEMBERSHIP TO LADIES.MANY    
 HAVE THEIR OWN DARTS AND FOOTBALL     
 TEAMS WHICH PLAY IN LOCAL LEAGUE      
 COMPETITIONS.PUBLIC HOUSES (PUBS) HAVE
 SIMILARY EVOLVED FROM BEER HOUSES TO  
 CATERING ESTABLISHMENTS WHERE MEALS OR
 SNACKS MAY BE BOUGHT AS WELL AS DRINK.
 MANY HAVE FAMILY ROOMS WHERE CHILDREN 
 CAN GO WITH THEIR PARENTS BUT NOT INTO
 THE BAR.PUBS AND CLUBS ORGANISE COACH 
 OUTINGS IN THE SUMMER TO COASTAL      
 RESORTS OR PLACES OF INTEREST.
