		<content> This region is quite diverse and is   
 bordered along the south by the upper 
 estuary of the{River Medway.}Due to   
 the salt water and fresh water mix an 
 interesting variety of wildlife is    
 found along the river which consists  
 of a stoney shoreline and a large area
 of{salt marsh.}As the latter area is  
 largely inaccessable,an extensive     
 variety of bird life is found,        
 particularly waders.                  
    Most of the rest of the region     
 consists of farmland(meadows,         
 cereals,market gardening, orchards ), 
 but there are two regions of mixed    
 woodland at Deangate and Cockham      
 Woods. Just outside the region but    
 having a strong influence on it is    
{Kingsnorth Power Station.}Although the
 chimney is tall(600ft.), the fallout  
 of sulphur dioxide is apparent by the 
 absence of lichen in the area.        </content>
