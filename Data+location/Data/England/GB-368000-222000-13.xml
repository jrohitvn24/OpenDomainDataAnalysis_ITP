		<title>13PLANT AND ANIMAL LIFE</title>
		<content>  The area is one of considerable      
 natural beauty with a great deal of   
{deciduous woodland,}as well as a      
 large area of{coniferous plantation.  
 Many of the fields are extremely      
 steep, which governs the use made of  
 the land.                             
  A tremendous variety of{wild flowers 
 can be found,with wild snowdrops and  
 later the daffodils bringing many     
 Spring sightseers.                    
{ Wild life}is also plentiful with     
 badgers,fox,stoat,weasal as well as   
 mice,voles,shrews and rabbits to be   
 found. Hares are now much rarer.      
  Buzzards,kestrel and sparrow hawk all
 hunt the smaller birds and mammals.   
 Ravens are present on May Hill.       
  There are several shooting syndicates
 with pheasant as the main game but    
 partridge, woodcock and wild duck are 
 occasionally shot.                    </content>
