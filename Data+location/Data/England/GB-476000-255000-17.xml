		<content>   From the questionnaire which we sent
out we found that nearly every family  
had a colour television, washing       
machine, refrigerator and vacuum       
cleaner. Most of them also had a       
freezer and a music centre. About half 
had videos,computers and tumble driers.
About a fifth had dishwashers and      
microwave ovens. It was noticeable that
all these appliances work on           
electricity. The questionnnaire also   
showed that nearly every family had a  
car.                                   
                                       
   In the future we think that there   
will be more remote controlled videos  
and better and smalller microwaves. We 
think that there might be moving stairs
in the house and electric doors which  
you can just walk up to and they open.
