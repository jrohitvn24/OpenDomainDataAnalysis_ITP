		<content> There are several farms in our block, 
 although the number has not changed   
 greatly in recent years. They are     
 mainly arable farms, with crops like  
 field peas, oats, barley and wheat. In
 the past farms were much more mixed   
 and less specialised. Much more       
 machinery is now used, and not so many
 people are needed to work on the      
 farms. There are some grazing lands   
 for sheep in our area, although not so
 much as there used to be. There are a 
 few small herds of pedigree cattle,   
 including Red Polls and Dexters. The  
 largest farming event in the area is  
 the Newbury Agricultural Show, which  
 is held in September. It is a two day 
 show and people come from all over the
 country to enjoy it. In 1984 the show 
 committee bought land opposite Priors 
 Court to provide a permanent site.
