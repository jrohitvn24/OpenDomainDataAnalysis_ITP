		<content> From Puckpool Point the{shore}changes.
 There is a bank of stones on the upper
 shore with seaweed covered stones and 
 rocks scattered over the middle and   
 lower shore. 3{seaforts}can be seen.  
 These were built in the 1850's as a   
 defence against Napoleon. Inland is a 
 silted up estuary called{The Duver.}  
 Originally a busy harbour, it was then
 used for salt manufacture. It is now  
 an  area of marshy pasture with lake, 
 dykes and a reedbed - a valuable area 
 for wildlife. The Duver Road ls a     
 privately owned{toll road.}It is a    
 popular launching site for{windsurfers
 at high tide. People living in the{   
{Salterns Cottages,}at the end of the  
 toll road, have the worry of being    
 flooded by Spring tides. From this    
 point there is a{winding footpath}    
 on the sea wall leading to Seaview.
