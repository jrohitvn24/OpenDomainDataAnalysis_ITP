   There was also a lot of open space  
 for safe animal grazing. There has    
 never been much industrial activity   
 here. The village economy was always  
 based on agriculture.

   The Windmill, a local landmark on   
 the Langton Rd., was probably built   
 about 1650, and was in use until the  
 1920s.It is now fully restored by     
 local fund_raising under the care of  
 the society for the protection of     
 Ancient Buildings, and is in working  
 order.                                
   It is a fine example of a Post Mill,
 and in 1711 the miller, Daniel        
 Hutchinson, carved his name on the    
 huge centre oak post.                 </content>
