		<content>{Hetton Independent Methodist Church   
 was founded in 1884. The age group of 
 members ranges from 10 yrs to 87 yrs. 
 There are usually{40 members}in the   
 congregation. It originated when the  
 Methodists could not afford to pay    
 for a minister, so they started a free
 democratic type of worship. At first, 
 they started worshipping in houses,   
 but as time progressed they built     
{churches.                             
                                       
{E. Rainton Chapel}was built in 1823   
 but it was in such bad condition it   
 had to be rebuilt in 1889. E. Rainton 
{Chapel}is only very small but although
 it is quite a disadvantage there are  
 still a lot of{activities}being held. 
 Every Sunday morning at 10.45{Sunday  
{School}is held. It is open to all ages
 up to 15 then you can help teach the  
 little ones.                          </content>
