		<content>{Melsonby}is  5 miles North of{Richmond
 and stands on  higher ground  with the
{A66}1 mile to the South and the {A1(M)
 1 mile  to the  East.  It  stands at a
 crossroads and has a {Norman church}to
 its  Eastern  end  which  is  a  local
 landmark.                             
 During Saxon times it was a settlement
 and after the  Norman conquest  became
 part of the  honour of  Richmond.  The
 area   seems  to   have  been   fairly
 prosperous  throughout  the  centuries
 with some{ copper mining} for a  short
 period in the{mid 19th. century.}     
 For most of this  century{ agriculture
 has predominated although the{ numbers
{employed}  in   this   industry   have
{considerably  reduced}  with  {greater
{mechanisation}   on  the  farms.   The
 growing of{ cereal crops}has{increased
 whilst  the rearing of{ livestock} has
{diminished.}                          </content>
