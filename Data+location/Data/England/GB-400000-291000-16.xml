 our area. Eight are primary, catering 
 for children aged five to eleven. Some
 of these schools have nursery and     
 infant facilities catering for younger
 children. On average about 250 pupils

 taught a full range of subjects and   
 sports.There is also a special school.
 There are two secondary schools with  
 over a thousand pupils in each, from  
 the age of eleven to eighteen,

 Both schools teach a full range of    
 courses, both academic and practical. 
 Many sports are played and there are
