		<title>13VINEYARD AT COLN ROGERS.</title>
		<content> From old maps going back to Roman     
 times it appears that a site on the   
 eastern banks of the Coln by Swain's  
 Bridge was favoured in times gone by  
 as a suitable situation for a         
 vineyard. In 1979 it was decided to   
 plant the one-acre site once again    
 with vines. The grapes produced are   
 mostly white, although some vines     
 bearing red grapes were included. In a
 good year the quantity of wine        
 produced amounts to 4000-5000 bottles,
 most of which are sold on a commercial
 basis under the name of "Cotes du     
 Coln". The success of this venture is 
 very dependent on the weather, and in 
 the poor summer of l985 it is doubtful
 if much wine was produced. On such a  
 small scale it is not commercially    
 viable to instal a plant for          
 processing the grapes, which are sent 
 to the Forest of Dean for this purpose</content>
