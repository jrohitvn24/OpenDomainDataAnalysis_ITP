		<title>12Local History on Horse-Eye</title>
		<content> Horse-Eye Level and Whelpley Level    
 have their own little bit of local    
 history. They derive their names from 
 the ancient word eye meaning isolated 
 small island. It is thought that this 
 dates from the time when the area was 
 mainly under the sea. Local Historians
 consider it probable that this area   
 was that used by the invading fleet of
 William of Normandy in 1066. Other    
 facts of history include the Drove    
 Road. This road starts on Horse-Eye   
 Level, travels across the marsh to    
 what is now known as Marshfoot Lane,  
 Hailsham to the cattle market there.  
 The cattle were driven in herds along 
 this route, hence the name Drove Road.
 It is also interesting to note the    
 road runs parallel with Horse-Eye     
 River &amp; White Dyke &amp; meets with Hurst 
 Haven on the marsh.
