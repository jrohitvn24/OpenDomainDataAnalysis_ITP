		<title>19Farming in Littlehampton</title>
		<content> There is a large concentration of     
 glasshouses in and around             
 Littlehampton which produce goods     
 ranging from tomatoes through to early
 vegatables and mushrooms. The         
 Horticultural branch of farming in    
 this area employs a great deal of     
 casual labour especially during the   
 picking season.                       
 The more traditional farming landuse  
 is devoted to the growing of cereal   
 crops especially wheat and to the     
 growing of rape seed which now gives  
 many of the fields its distinctive    
 yellow colour.                        
 The types of animal farming in this   
 area is dominated by dairy cattle     
 ,pigs and poultry.The farmers use the 
 water meadows on either side of the   
 river Arun for the dairy herds as the 
 land here is unsuitable for cereal    
 crops.                                </content>
