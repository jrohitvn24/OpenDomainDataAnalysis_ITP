		<content> Carey Parc is a modern housing        
 development in Mullion.Building       
 started 15 years ago, and from time to
 time houses are still built here.The  
 houses are timber-framed, with wooden 
 cladding front and back.The end walls 
 are of local stone. At present there  
 are 132 houses on the estate. On the  
 16th July 1985 there were 8 houses for
 sale. The occupants of 4 of them had  
 already moved, leaving the houses     
 empty. One was being used as a holiday
 home.  One person refused to answer   
 our questions. The occupants of the   
 other two were moving for different   
 reasons.One was a young woman who had 
 no work. She had lived in Mullion for 
 16 years, and was moving 9 miles to   
 Helston. The other was an old lady who
 had lived in Mullion for 6 years.She  
 needed a larger house. If she has to  
 leave the village she will be unhappy.</content>
