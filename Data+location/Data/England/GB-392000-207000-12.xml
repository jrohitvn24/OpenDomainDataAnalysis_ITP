		<content>  {Before 1945 the village housed only 
{farm and Estate workers,the few       
{youngsters independent of the Estate  
{travelling to Stroud for employment.  
   Farm mechanisation drastically      
 reduced the manpower needed and Estate
 maintenance was drafted to the local  
 builder.Cottages are now rented to    
 families with business away from the  
 area.                                 
   A local bus service met the needs   
 of a community totaly dependent on it.
 Most families now own a car which     
 allows shopping and working further   
 afield.                               
  {Until the early 1950's living       
{conditions were extremely primitive in
{most cottages.}A standpipe served     
 several homes.{There was outside      
{sanitation,no bathrooms and clothes   
{were washed by hand.
