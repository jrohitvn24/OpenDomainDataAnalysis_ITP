		<title>11RISDEN'S WOOD,HARLOW</title>
		<content> This is a large area-nearly 1/4km2 of 
 open woodland next to Parndon Wood and
 Crematorium.The wood is not fenced,and
 there are several rides running       
 through it for the walker.There are   
 wooden bridges over the streams.      
 At the northern end,most of the trees 
 are hornbeams,with a few oaks,silver  
 birch and poplar.Few plants grow under
 these trees,so woods are open.Insects 
 are abundant here and provide a varied
 food supply for birds.The trees       
 provide cover for birds to nest and   
 food for squirrels and mice.          
 In the Southern part-Hospital wood-a  
 wider range of trees grows.There is   
 more undergrowth and sunny clearings. 
 Foxes and rabbits live here.          
 There is a steepsided pond in the     
 middle of the wood and moisture loving
 trees grow nearby.Photo 3 shows the   
 pond.                                 </content>
