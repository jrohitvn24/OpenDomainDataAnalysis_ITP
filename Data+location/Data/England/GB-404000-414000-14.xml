		<title>14RECREATION ON SCAMMONDEN DAM</title>
		<content> In the past Water Authority land has  
 been kept strictly private,but with   
 increasing leisure there has been a   
 change in attitudes.Now dinghies sail 
 across Scammonden Dam and people walk 
 or picnic on the banks.               
 The Sailing Club was formed in 1971   
 and now has around 120 members.It     
 costs Â£30 a year to use the facilities
 while day membership tickets cost Â£5. 
 Although the weekend is inevitably the
 most popular sailing time,Wednesday   
 and Thursday evenings see a good turn-
 out.The club headquarters are in the  
 old Deanhead Vicarage where a bar is  
 included in the facilities.For the    
 more adventurous, there is now a wind-
 surfing section.                      
 The conversion of an old farm building
 into a Youth Activity Centre is going 
 ahead and when completed it will      
 accommodate 36 young people.          </content>
