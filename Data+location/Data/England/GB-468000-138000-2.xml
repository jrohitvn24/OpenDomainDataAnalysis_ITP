		<title>02Indoor Recreation in Alton</title>
		<content>    The Community Centre is a large    
 building near the middle of Alton.In  
 it there is a bar for members and a   
 large hall where discos, markets and  
 jumble sales are held. There is a room
 upstairs where the old people go for  
 some peace and quiet.There are        
 competitions in the bar such as darts 
 and the person who makes us laugh the 
 most.                                 
    I go to the Sports Centre on the   
 edge of town on Thursday,Saturday and 
 Sunday.It has activities which appeal 
 to a wide age range.I play tennis at  
 the Centre.You can also try badminton,
 squash,table tennis,trampolining,     
 swimming,roller skating,weight        
 training, judo, archery, pistol       
 shooting and keep fit.You can go on   
 the B.M.X. bicycle ramp outside, or in
 the sauna or jacuzi. There is a cafe  
 where you can get refreshments.       </content>
