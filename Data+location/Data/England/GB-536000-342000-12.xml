		<title>12SCHOOLS (BUTTERWICK)</title>
		<content>   The school at Butterwick was opened 
 on 13th.July 1973 at 2.30p.m.. The    
 headmaster was Mr.G.H.Greenfield. Two 
 years later he was succeeded by the   
 present head Mr. D. Laver. Before     
 this the local children went to three 
 schools, in Bennington, Freiston and  
 Butterwick. The old school in         
 Butterwick was built in 1666. In 1887 
 it became the girls school and is now 
 a Youth Club. A boys school was built,
 where the present school now stands,  
 in 1887.                              
   There are now 4 junior and 3 infant 
 classes, with 225 children. Many      
 travel in buses coming from North     
 Sea Camp, Bennington and Long Hedges. 
   Some children have been on a four   
 day outing to Scarborough this year   
 and each class has local outings at   
 least once a year.
