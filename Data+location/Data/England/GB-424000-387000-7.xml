		<content> The whole western,northern and        
 southern part of the area is typified 
 by low,inhospitable moorland on the   
 flat tops of ridges that form the     
 hills between the Peak District and   
 Sheffield.                            
 There is nowadays no natural tree     
 cover of significance but conifers,   
 birches,dwarf oaks and beech grow in  
 the gullies or {cloughs}that small    
 streams flow down, draining the moors.
                                       
 Enclosure of the land is by dry stone 
 walling, but it is being replaced by  
 fencing as the walls collapse. Many   
 stone sheep folds are still visible.  
 Until the 1940s quarrying for clay and
 building or roofing stone was an      
 important industry and the moor is    
 littered with the workings a large    
 example being on the N.W.corner of the
 area.                                 </content>
