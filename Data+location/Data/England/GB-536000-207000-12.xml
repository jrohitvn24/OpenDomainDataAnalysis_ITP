  {Rawden House}was known as The Grange
 and was originally built in 1500. It  
 was bought in 1591 by William         
 Thrugood, grandfather of Dame         
 Elizabeth Rawden and formed part of   
 her dowry at her marriage in 1611. The
 first Rawden to live there was her    
 second son Marmaduke who after his    
 journeys overseas settled at Hoddesdon
 in 1656. Dame Elizabeth left the      
 property to her son who lived there   
 until he died in 1701. The property   
 then went to his daughter Sarah who   
 sold the house.                       
  It is currently used as office       
 accommodation and is undoubtedly one  
 of the finest buildings in the High   
 Street.
