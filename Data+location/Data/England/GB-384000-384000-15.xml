		<content> If you are ill you telephone the      
 Doctor for an appointment.            
 You go to the                         
 Doctor's Surgery. When you have seen  
 him he wll give you a prescription.   
 You take it to the Chemist where you  
 buy the medicine. If you are too ill  
 to visit the surgery the Doctor will  
 come to your home. Every 6 months you 
 should visit the Dentist to have your 
 teeth checked. There are 5 Dental     
 Surgeries in this area.  If you have  
 trouble with your feet you can go to  
 the Chiropodist. The School Nurse and 
 Doctor come to school to keep a check 
 on you also. They check your hair     
 regularly , look at your nails and    
 then give you an eye test and a       
 hearing test.  There is also an       
 Opticians  in Heald Green where you   
 can have eye tests and buy glasses.
