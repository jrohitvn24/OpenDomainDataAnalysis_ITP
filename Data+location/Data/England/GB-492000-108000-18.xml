		<title>18Slindon College Animals.</title>
		<content> In the College grounds,Mr.P.J.Wright, 
 the Headmaster, owns and keeps a great
 variety of animals. These include     
 goats,wallabies,sheep,chickens,       
 peacocks, ornamental birds, and race  
 horses. The boys enjoy helping in this
 area of school life,feeding the       
 animals, milking the goats and        
 cleaning the cages,pens and aviarys.  
 Some of the boys have rabbits and     
 other pets such as snakes,ferrets and 
 guinea pigs, and these are looked     
 after by their owners and the animal  
 boys. There are also peafowl, but     
 these seem to take care of themselves,
 and roost in the surrounding trees at 
 night.                                
 In the grounds there are also man_made
 ponds which are full of natural       
 wildlife, and these have proved useful
 as well as beautiful,as the Biology   
 Department uses them for some lessons.</content>
