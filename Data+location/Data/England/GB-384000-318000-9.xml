		<content>Our farmer gets up at half past four   
and sits in his house reading the      
paper for half an hour.He goes out to  
milk the cows at 5o'clock then,when he 
has finished,he washes up,cleans       
the parlour,feeds the calves,does lame 
cows feet and attends to any sick      
cows.At 8 o'clock he has his breakfast 
After breakfast he telephones and      
decides what to do for the day,this    
depends on the season and weather.     
He does different jobs every day.      
Sometimes he combines or bales straw.  
Sometimes he makes silage or takes a   
journey to town. He may put chemicals  
or fertiliser on the field,mend fences,
drains and roads,sow seeds or drives   
his tractor.He has his lunch  at 12.30 
and carries on with his jobs afterwards

is at 6p.m.He has two men to help him  
and his wife and son.                  </content>
