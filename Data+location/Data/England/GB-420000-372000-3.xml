		<title>03The Hamlet of Rowland.</title>
		<content> Rowland is the more populated of the  
 two hamlets which lie entirely within 
 this survey block. It has about a     
 dozen houses, mostly conversions of   
 old stone cottages and mostly occupied
 by people either retired or working   
 elsewhere. It lies on the flat valley 
 bottom at the foot of Longstone Edge  
 and has several farms.                
 It also has a small reservoir near it,
 which has a circular metal cover,     
 which resembles a flying saucer.      
 Rowland is the focus of a network of  
 public footpaths which lead not only  
 to neighbouring villages or farms but 
 also up to the mining areas on        
 Longstone Edge.
