		<content>  On Saturday 15th June there was a    
 country carnival at{the Vicarage.}A   
 variety of{stalls}raised Â£900. There  
 was also a{fancy dress competition    
 with people dressed in the costumes of
 a number of different countries.      
  My class took part in a{tug-of-war   
 against children from{Kirbie Kendal   
{School}while Morris men and Lady      
 dancers performed throughout the      
 afternoon. Some people volunteered to 
 go in the stocks to have wet sponges  
 thrown at them. There was also a{Punch
{and Judy show}and a man demonstrating 
 how to shoe a horse. Another showed   
 how to make a dry stone wall.         
  There was one stall selling carved   
 walking sticks, another had animals   
 made out of cotton wool and a third,  
 a selection of ornate candles. Sweets 
 were on sale at Second World War      
 prices.                               </content>
