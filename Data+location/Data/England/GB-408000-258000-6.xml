		<content>      When we visited Springfields     
 Nurseries, the owner showed us some   
 of the crops he grows.These include   
 lettuce, tomatoes, beans, leeks,      
 celery, cabbages, sprouts and flowers.
 People were coming to buy bedding     
 plants and hanging baskets.           
      There are 50 acres of land with  
 6 large greenhouses and several poly- 
 houses.These are made with polythene  
 instead of glass, because it is       
 cheaper.                              
      In one polyhouse we saw soil     
 being sterilized. A large plastic     
 sheet covered the soil and hot steam  
 was piped under it. The sheet blew up 
 in a dome-shape. It was hot to        
 touch. The steam kills all the germs  
 and bugs which attack young plants.   
 We also saw a massive boiler which    
 heats water to make steam and keeps   
 the greenhouses hot in winter.        </content>
