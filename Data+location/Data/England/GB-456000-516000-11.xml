		<title>11BARNABY SIDE FARM</title>
		<content> All the land in this area is{farmland 
 apart from one small{deciduous wood.  
 The{farm building}is at the foot of   
 the hill with the fields behind it.We 
 saw{spring sown barley}in one field.  
 Other areas were just{grassland}while 
 nearer to the farm there where{pigs.  
 The only other buildings in this area 
 are called{Greenwood Cottages.}These  
 are two{sandstone}cottages which are  
 probably used by the{farm workers.    
 Near to the cottages we could see a   
 raised mound running across the       
 field.This was the course of an old   
{railway track}which probably was used 
 by the{mines.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
