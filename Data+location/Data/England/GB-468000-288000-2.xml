		<title>02HOMES IN FOXTON/GARTREE</title>
		<content> The population of Foxton, Gartree and 
 Gumley may be very small but there    
 exists a wide range of places people  
 live in.                              
 Foxton is a conservation area i.e.it  
 cannot be expanded beyond it's current
 boundaries.Any new building can only  
 occur in space between present        
 buildings or if an old house is       
 demolished.                           
 Most people are buying their homes in 
 Foxton,although there are a few       
 council houses at the bottom of       
 Swingbridge Street.The Gartree prison 
 estate,consisting of semi,terraced and
 detatched houses is totally owned by  
 the Home Office.                      
 Gumley has lots of old country        
 cottages                              
 Some people also live in mobile homes 
 and narrow-boats at Foxton locks
