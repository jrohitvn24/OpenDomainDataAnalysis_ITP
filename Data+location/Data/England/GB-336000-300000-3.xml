		<content> In the past the local policeman had to
 come up from Minsterley Police Station
 on his cycle.The Minsterley Station   
 closed in about 1970. Now the nearest 
 Police Station is Pontesbury. Nowadays
 policemen can communicate with each   
 other very well. They have radios to  
 contact each other, but they can't    
 communicate in Stiperstones because of
 the lead in the hills.The Police      
 Station would have to contact them by 
 telephoning.The policeman would have  
 to tell his headquarters where he was 
 going in this area and, if possible,  
 tell them the phone number of his     
 location.                             
 There isn't much vandalism or local   
 burglary but the area does suffer from
 cattle and sheep rustling in the      
 summer months,particularly on the open
 moorland.                             
                                       </content>
