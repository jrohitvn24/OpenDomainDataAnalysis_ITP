		<title>18OAK TREE IN UPEND VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The oak tree in Upend village is on a 
 little green with wild flowers around 
 it. There is a metal fence round the  
 tree and a plaque which says:         
 "THIS TREE WAS PLANTED TO COMMEMORATE 
 THE CORONATION OF OUR BELOVED QUEEN   
 ELIZABETH 11 BY HER LOYAL SUBJECTS IN 
 THE VILLAGE OF UPEND ON THE SECOND OF 
 JUNE 1953."                           
 The oak tree is 11\ metres high. To   
 measure the height we got a half metre
 and a whole metre stick. We laid the  
 metre stick down, and stood the half  
 metre stick up at the end of it. We   
 lined it up to the tree top. The      
 distance to the tree was 23m so the   
 height was half that.                 
 Around its girth is 1metre. The       
 branches spread out to the north by   
 3.60m, to the east by 6m, to the south
 by 5.20m, and to the west by 4.20m.
