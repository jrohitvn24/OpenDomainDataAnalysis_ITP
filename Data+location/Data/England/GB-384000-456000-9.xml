		<title>09 My Favourite T.V Programmes</title>
		<content>    I have a colour T.V at home and I  
 have a few favourite programmes.      
    The first one is Bonanza.I like it 
 because every programme in the series 
 is full of fun and drama.My favourite 
 character is Hoss because he is always
 eating .                              
    Another one of my favourite        
 programmes is Emmerdale Farm because  
 the conversation is always            
 interesting.                          
   I also like So You Want To Be Top   
 because the games are so full of      
 fun.                                  
    My least favourite game is the Fib 
 Game.                                 
    At school my favourite programme is
  Music Time.I like it because the     
 people ask the viewers questions.     
    Another school programme is Zig    
 Zag.This term it is about flowers,    
 fruit and vegetables.                 </content>
