		<content> We went to the estate agents to       
 interview them for the Domesday       
 Project. We asked many questions. The 
 most popular time of the year for     
 people to buy houses is in May _ the  
 sale takes two and a half months _ and
 then the people like to move in the   
 summer. Estate agents do not sell     
 caravans. One estate agent sells      
 around fifteen to twenty houses a     
 month.An average price of a house is  
 Â£40,000; but it can range up to       
 Â£1,000000 for a really big old manor  
 house. The price of a house includes  
 its grounds and any extras it may     
 have, such as swimming pool or tennis 
 courts. Housing varies from medieval  
 or 19th. century terraces to modern   
 semi-detached or detached residences  
 or small blocks of flats; but it is   
 all built in brick.
