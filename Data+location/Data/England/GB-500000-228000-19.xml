		<title>19NEWS AND VIEWS IN TODDINGTON</title>
		<content> Recent{news items}about Toddington may
 be found in several local papers like 
 The Leader, Luton News, Herald and The
 Dunstable Gazette. The main story     
 concerns the{Town Hall,}subject of an 
 enquiry to decide its future. Village 
 opinion, backed up by the Parish and  
 District Councils, favours demolishing
 rather than restoring it. However, the
 County Council wants it to be repaired
 hence the Public Enquiry.             
  Three other stories also make regular
 headlines. One is{vandalism}with many 
 solutions such as police patrols or   
 neighbourhood watch schemes suggested.
 Another social concern is the{heavy   
{traffic}from the motorway thundering  
 past the green. There are repeated    
 pleas for a pedestrian crossing. Then 
 there are regular stories about plans 
 to build three hundred{new houses}here
 a move almost universally unpopular.  </content>
