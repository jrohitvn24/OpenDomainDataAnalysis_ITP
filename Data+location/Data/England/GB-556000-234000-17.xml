 In June, a Flower Festival was held in
 the Parish Church. This was organised 
 by the Churchwardens, Mr.Bob Greene   
 and Mrs.Janet Swan. The Church was    
 decorated with flower arrangements (17
 in all) which illustrated the 'Life of
 Jesus', ranging from 'The             
 Annunciation' to 'The Ascension'.     
 Events in the life of Our Lord were   
 cleverly illustrated by the choice of 
 colours and flowers used. In order to 
 raise money for the Church Fund, the  
 Festival was held over 2 days, and in 
 the grounds of the old rectory (now a 
 private house), were stalls selling   
 plants, cakes and produce, and items  
 made by the local craft group. There  
 was also a barbecue. The Flower       
 Festival raised more than Â£1000.
