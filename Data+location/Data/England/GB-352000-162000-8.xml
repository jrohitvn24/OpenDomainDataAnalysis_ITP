		<title>08Ridgehill or Regil ?</title>
		<content>   If you are looking for Regil on an  
 Ordnance Survey Map, I doubt whether  
 you would find it. On most maps       
 nowadays, Regil is written as         
 Ridgehill. Local people write Regil.  
 Anyway, the place is situated south of
 Winford and most people have never    
 heard of it!                          
   There is a village hall, an updated 
 telephone box which is hardly ever    
 used and a noticeboard which is nearly
 always full. There is a postbox in the
 wall of the old school house and I've 
 heard people say that the letters are 
 eaten by snails before the postman    
 arrives to collect them!              
   There are about 200 people living in
 Regil today. There are 4 or 5 farms   
 and some people have started their own
 small holdings. Quite a few of the    
 inhabitants commute between Regil and 
 Bristol or Regil and the local pub!   </content>
