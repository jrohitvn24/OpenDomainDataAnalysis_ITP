		<title>02THE TOWN OF CHRISTCHURCH</title>
		<content>   CHRISTCHURCH IS SITUATED ON THE     
 SOUTH COAST OF ENGLAND WHERE THE      
 RIVERS STOUR AND AVON ENTER THE SEA.  
 IT HAS A SHALLOW HARBOUR WHICH IS     
 POPULAR WITH SAILORS BUT IT IS NOT    
 DEEP ENOUGH FOR COMMERCIAL TRAFFIC.   
 AS THE TOWN IS OLD AND HAS A BEAUTIFUL
 PRIORY IT IS A POPULAR PLACE FOR      
 TOURISTS TO VISIT AND ALTHOUGH THERE  
 ARE FEW HOTELS AND GUEST HOUSES THERE 
 IS A HOLIDAY CAMP SITUATED NEAR THE   
 TOWN CENTRE ON THE QUAY.  THERE IS    
 ALSO A LEISURE PARK AND MODEL VILLAGE 
 NEARBY WHICH ATTRACTS MANY VISITORS.  
   CHRISTCHURCH HAS SOME LIGHT INDUSTRY
 BUT THERE IS NOT MUCH IN THIS BLOCK AS
 IT IS MAINLY HOUSING AND SHOPS.  A NEW
 SHOPPING PRECINCT CALLED SAXON SQUARE 
 HAS RECENTLY OPENED NEAR THE HIGH     
 STREET AND THIS CONTAINS A LARGE      
 SUPERMARKET AND MANY ATTRACTIVE SHOPS.
