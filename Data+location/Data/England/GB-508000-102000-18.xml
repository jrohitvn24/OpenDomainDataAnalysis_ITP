		<title>18A DAY IN THE LIFE OF</title>
		<content>   I am 8 years old.  On a normal day I
 would wake up and get dressed.  Then I
 would have my breakfast, do my teeth  
 and wash.  After that I would pack my 
 bag with an apron, P.E. kit and       
 slippers.  If I have any time then I  
 play.  Then I go to school.  I go to  
 John  Selden First School.            
   The school doors open at ten to     
 nine.  Often I do a picture . After   
 that we go to an assembly.  After the 
 assembly we do a story or a sheet of  
 number work.  At twenty-five to eleven
 we go to play and at ten to eleven we 
 come in form play.                    
   We have milk and carry on with our  
 work. At twelve o'clock we go out to  
 play again.  That play ends at        
 half-past twelve.  Once we come in we 
 have lunch. When we finish lunch we   
 wait until it is quarter to one then  
 we go out to play again until one.    </content>
