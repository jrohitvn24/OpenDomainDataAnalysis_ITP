		<title>10Local administration I.</title>
		<content> Administration of the area takes place
 at a number of levels.                
 The lowest level of administration is 
 the parish council - Ingatestone and  
 Fryerning parish council has limited  
 powers over some purely local matters.
 The council consists of thirteen      
 members who are democratically        
 elected, there is no sub-division of  
 the parish into wards for electoral   
 purposes. There is a small parish     
 council office in the same building as
 Ingatestone community club at the     
 northern end of the High Street.      
                                       
 Only the area roughly to the east of  
 the River Wid lies within Ingatestone 
 parish, the area to the west is not   
 administered at parish council level  
 as only certain areas retained parish 
 councils after local government       
 re-organisation in the 1970's.        </content>
