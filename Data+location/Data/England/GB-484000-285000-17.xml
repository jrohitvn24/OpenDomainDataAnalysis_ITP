		<title>17PILKINGTON   GLASS</title>
		<content> Pilkington glass is an{enormous       
  factory and is very well spaced out  
 I found out that it only coats glass  
 and doesn't make glass as I thought.  
 They sell their coated glass locally. 
 That was one of the reasons they moved
 here. The name for the coated  glass  
 was Kappafloat.The glass when being   
 transported gets wrapped up in        
 foam to protect it.We weren't         
 allowed in the actual place where they
 coated the glass but we went into the 
 packing deapartment.I expected to     
 see about{50 _ 60}workers but I could 
 only  see two .The man that was taking
 us round said they only employ{35 _ 40
 workers.They havn't been here very    
 long and thre aren't any signs of them
 polluting Great Oakly yet.It          
 advertises in the press.
