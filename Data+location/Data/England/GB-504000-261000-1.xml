		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO RISELEY</title>
		<content>                                       
      Riseley, a pleasant roadside     
 village, is situated on a minor road  
 eleven miles north of Bedford and     
 three miles north-east of the A6 trunk
 road which runs through the south-west
 corner of our area, which is mostly   
 farmland.  Another road runs through  
 Riseley and Knotting.  The lastest    
 estimate of population in Riseley is  
 l0l2.  Knotting, a much smaller       
 village, consists of 26 households.   
      There are seven farms; Knotting  
 Green, Lodge, Manor, Strawberry Hill, 
 High Barn and Haring's, the fields    
 being separated by hedges and fences. 
 Only five woods remain;Galsey Wood,   
 Temple Wood, Temple Spinney, Penn Wood
 and Worley's Wood. Most of the soil is
 clay, so it is not surprising that    
 there used to be a brickworks which   
 supplied bricks for Riseley.          </content>
