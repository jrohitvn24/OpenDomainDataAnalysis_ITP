		<title>02DATCHET</title>
		<content> Datchet is still a village centred    
 round a  green although most of its   
 inhabitants commute daily to London.  
   Founded in Celtic times on a stretch
 of land slightly higher than the river
 and marshes,Datchet had little room to
 expand.The M4 motorway  now performs a
 similar function.                     
  The village has both a primary and a 
 secondary school ,large recreational  
 fields with a childrens' playground,  
 several pubs,a number of shops and    
 near the centre of the village,       
 St.Mary's church.                     
   For those who wish to travel from   
 Datchet to Windsor the most memorable 
 part of Datchet is the railway level  
 crossing which regularily causes      
 traffic congestion.                   
 .
