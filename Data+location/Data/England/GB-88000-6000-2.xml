		<content> Up at Higher Town there are 4 farms   
 growing potatoes and flowers in small 
 fields with tall hedges for           
 windbreaks.Narcissi and  Daffodils    
 (Paperwhites + Soleil d'or) are the   
 most popular flowers. In the old days 
 people used to grow and sell          
 Violets,Jacks and Botham. Potatoes are
 grown as a break crop to give the     
 ground a rest from flowers.On all     
 farms there are 3 sections which are  
 called Rough Grazing,Pasture  and     
 Arable.There are 3 seasons of growing 
 flowers and food and they are Flower  
 season which lasts from October to    
 March,Potatoe season which is just in 
 April and Bulb season which lasts from
 June to August.The farmers send  to   
 London,Leeds,Leicester,Birmingham     
 and Gatesheads markets.The most       
 important things are windbreaks.
