		<content> The activities of the village revolve 
 around The Barn, which is an old flint
 tithe barn given by the incumbent of  
 the parish some years ago, together   
 with an adjoining playing field, for  
 general use and enjoyment of the      
 village. Local organisations using the
 Barn regularly: Wives Club, Senior    
 Club, Mothers Union, Village Society, 
 Model Engineering, Parochial Church   
 and Parish Councils, Badminton, Indoor
 Bowls and a Playschool (held thrice   
 weekly). Other events include Whist   
 Drives, annual Harvest Supper, Flower 
 and Photographic Exhibitions and all  
 elections. In the playing field are   
 swings, climbing frame, see-saw and a 
 rocking horse, all of which are much  
 used by the younger children. Also    
 during the winter season, a Youth     
 Football team plays on the nearby     
 pitch.                                </content>
