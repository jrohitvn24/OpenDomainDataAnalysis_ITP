		<title>13THE CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATE</title>
		<content> The Conservative candidate is Robert  
 James.                                
 He is fifty-four years old and has    
 lived in Comberton for the past       
 twenty-nine years.                    
 Mr James has been involved in         
 politics for a long time.             
 When we interviewed him he said that  
 he liked his job but there were times 
 when he disliked it.                  
 One of the jobs Mr. James is          
 responsible for is not letting the    
 village grow any bigger than it       
 is.Also Mr. James was responsible for 
 moving the motorway further away from 
 a neighbouring village.               
 Mr. James said he was going to improve
 schools, roads and libraries but Mr.  
 James said this would not effect      
 Meridian school because it's got room 
 for two hundred or more pupils.
