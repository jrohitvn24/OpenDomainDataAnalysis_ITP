		<title>15ARMED ROBBERY</title>
		<content> An{armed robbery}took place outside   
 Balfour's newsagent and sub-post      
 office in Fleming Crescent, Sele Farm 
 Estate, Hertford on May 14th.         
   Two gunmen, with a sawn-off shotgun 
 and a handgun, held up two Post       
 Office employers and seized{Â£10000}in 
 cash after they stopped their vehicle 
 outside Balfour's at 11.10am.         
   The gunmen were joined by a third   
 robber who then raced to a stolen     
 getaway car, a red Ford Sierra estate 
 which was waiting in Tudor Way, with  
 a fourth man at the wheel.            
     The snatch lasted only a few      
 seconds and the two Post Office       
 employees were unable to use their    
 hand held alarms.  Police have already
 received descriptions of the four     
 men seen by witnesses.
