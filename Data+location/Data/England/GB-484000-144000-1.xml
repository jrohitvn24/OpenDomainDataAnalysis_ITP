		<title>01DESCRIPTION OF THE AREA</title>
		<content> The NW area comprises part of the town
 of Farnham with a supermarket,        
 police station,railway station, sports
 centre,theatre, health centre etc.    
  The population is concentrated in the
 NW corner spreading outwards through a
 lower density, prosperous, residential
 area with agricultural land to the    
 east and wooded land to the south.    
 After crossing the NW corner, the     
 River Wey flows generally southwards  
 through the eastern half.             
 Farnham is within 1 hour of London by 
 rail which makes it popular with      
 commuters. A number of roads radiate  
 from Farnham. The area is prosperous  
 with low unemployment.Property prices 
 are high which restricts movement into
 the area to the higher income levels. 
  The number of non-white people living
 here is well below average.           
 There are places of historic interest.</content>
