 There are a lot of shops in Ellesmere 
 because we have a lot of tourists here
 because of the mere and canal. People 
 like to take gifts home to their      
 friends and family. We have a lot of  
 food stores but we have not many      
 clothes stores everyone goes to       
 Oswestry to buy their clothes. There  
 is only one toy shop but there are two
 that sell a few toys. There are a lot 
 of chip shops, again maybe because we 
 have a lot of tourists. We also have a
 lot of cafes, pubs and hotels mainly  
 because of the visitors we have. We   
 have two newsagents which is just     
 enough for a town as big as Ellesmere.
