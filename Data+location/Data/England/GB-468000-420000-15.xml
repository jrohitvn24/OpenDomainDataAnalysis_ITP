 Every Tuesday night the Brownie pack  
 meets.  There are 15 brownies and we  
 work for badges, go on ventures. We   
 have 2 groups one called the Kelpies  
 and another called the Pixies.  You   
 have to be 7 years old to join the    
 brownies and leave when you are 11 to 
 be a Girl Guide.  Our motto is "lend a
 hand" and our law is "a brownie guide 
 thinks of others before herself and   
 does a good turn every day". After 6  
 weeks you become enrolled and take the
 brownie guide promise which is "I     
 promise that I will do my best to do  
 my duty to God to serve the queen and 
 help other people and to keep the     
 brownie guide law". We were a brown   
 dress, a yellow tie a brown belt and a
 brown pom pom hat, white socks and    
 brown shoes.
