		<content> I think Ripon is a nice city because  
 it is clean and tidy and the people   
 are very friendly  especialy the old  
 folk.It is a very pleasant place to   
 live its nice and peaceful.In the City
 centre there are lots of old houses   
 and shops and lots of back alleys,thin
 and winding.There aren't many shops   
 but on Thursday there is a market and 
 on Saturday there are fruit and       
 vegetable stalls.                     
 There are three rivers in Ripon the   
 Skell,Ure and Laver.                  
 Most people call Ripon a town,as it is
 very small to be a city in fact it is 
 the smallest city in Great Britain.   
 Next year in 1986 our city will       
 celebrate its 1100th birthday.Ripon   
 was started by an Anglian tribe called
 the Hyrpe folk.King Alfred gave the   
 city a charter in 886 and so from     
 there 1100 years later is 1986.       </content>
