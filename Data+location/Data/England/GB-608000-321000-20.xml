		<title>20A School Day.</title>
		<content>  Our school starts at 8.55.I get up at
 7.30 and have my breakfast and get    
 dressed.About 8.20 I clean my teeth   
 and wash.My friend comes round for me 
 at 8.25 and we walk to school.        
  When we get to school there is       
 usually time to play before the bell  
 goes.After the 1st lesson we have a   
 break at 10.40 and it ends at 11.00.  
  Dinner is at 12.00 if you go home or 
 have a school dinner but you have to  
 wait \ an hour if you eat your own    
 packed lunch.At 1.15 we come inside   
 again.                                
  On Mondays there is art or craft     
 and on Wednesday we have games which  
 includes Football,Rounders,Hockey and 
 Netball.Most people like woodwork     
 needlework and games.At 2.15 we have  
 another break that ends at 2.30.School
 finishes at 3.30.
