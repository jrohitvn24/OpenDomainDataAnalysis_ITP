  We have a lane that parts the house  
 and gardens from the fields. The stone
 sheds are in very good condition. My  
 Dad has just made a spacious new barn 
 of sheet iron and metal posts, which  
 is 25 metres by 15 metres in size.    
 The lane is tarmac and the yards are  
 concrete. There is a small sheep dip, 
 which my Dad has just made, in the    
 concrete by the side of the barn.     
    Once a year we have a sheep shearer
 in. We have machinery, some second    
 hand. My Dad sometimes takes sheep to 
 auctions to sell them. Sometimes he   
 buys a few more.
