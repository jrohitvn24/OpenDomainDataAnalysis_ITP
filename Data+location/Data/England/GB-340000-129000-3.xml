		<title>03THE RIFLE RANGE, HIGH HAM</title>
		<content> The present range dates from 1938,    
 although this area has been used for  
 weapons training for much longer;     
 indeed the Duke of Monmouth's men     
 practised here. During World War 2 it 
 was used by the Army &amp; the Home Guard.
 It is now owned by H.M.S. Heron and   
 used by the Navy and Marines for small
 arms training. The weapons used are   
 self-loading rifles and light machine-
 guns. The men follow a course and are 
 examined in weapons training,from     
 stripping, cleaning and care of arms, 
 to firing at man-shaped targets. The  
 range is a fixed line gallery range,  
 not a tactical one. There is a public 
 right of way over the range following 
 a designated footpath, except when red
 flags are flying, signalling that the 
 range is in use and public access is  
 denied. The range is used almost      
 daily, mainly from May to July.       </content>
