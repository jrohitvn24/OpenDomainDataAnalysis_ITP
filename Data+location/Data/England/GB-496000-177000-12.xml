		<title>12TOURISTS IN ETON</title>
		<content> Tourists visiting Windsor Castle often
 cross the bridge,which is now closed  
 to traffic,to walk through Eton to    
 Eton College.The college buildings,   
 situated above Baldwins bridge, are   
 many and varied , but there is no     
 mistaking the heart of the College,the
 Chapel,which was built for Henry VI.  
  We spent half an hour on the bridge  
 asking people where they had come     
 from.Most were from the U.S.A. and    
 Japan,others were from Germany,Brazil,
 New Zealand,Australia and Korea.      
  Some tourists come in the Windsor    
 tour bus, a white double-decker which 
 has to come a long way round to reach 
 the High Street as it can't cross the 
 bridge.                               
  Tourists often spend money in the    
 Eton shops ,pubs and restaurants.     
                                       
                                       </content>
