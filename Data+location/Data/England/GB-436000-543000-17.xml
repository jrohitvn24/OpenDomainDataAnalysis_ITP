		<content>{Hello,my name is Katy Wall.           
                                       
  I am eight years old. I am in Class  
 2. We are very lucky because we have  
 the biggest room in the whole school. 
 We have a painting corner and a play  
 corner which is also used for reading.
 We have a computer corner. Miss Robson
 got some new computer games and the   
 youngest children are playing on iy   
 now .                                 
       We have sand and water for      
 experiments which we record in our    
 Maths books. In the middle of our room
 we have a big, green, comfortable     
 carpet. We sit on the carpet when the 
 teacher talks to us about our work and
 also for stories.                     
                                       
{I think we have the best class in the 
{whole school!
