		<title>16Kingswood near Pentewan</title>
		<content> Kingswood is a large wood stretching  
 from London Apprentice to Pentewan.It 
 is owned by the forestry commission   
 who have been trying to stop horses   
 and motorbikes from riding up         
 there.About a year ago they put up    
 boundaries just in from the beginning 
 either side of a lane that leads up to
 a farm.This used to be a lane for pony
 and traps but it is very stoney and   
 can only be used for riding up there. 
 Recently one of the boundaries has    
 been broken and riders use it as a    
 jump.                                 
  The forestry commission used to use  
 the woods for shooting but they have  
 stopped this now.                     
  They used to have man walking around 
 keeping bikes out and planting new    
 trees but he has gone and the trees   
 are broken.                           
                                       </content>
