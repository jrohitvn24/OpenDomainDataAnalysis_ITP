		<title>08RESULTS OF TRAFFIC SURVEY</title>
		<content> The group concluded that most traffic 
 to Dover does not originate in        
 Cantrtbury so the by-pass route is    
 used more frequently than the A2 by   
 people to travelling to and from the  
 ports.  Therefore local traffic tended
 to,use both the A2 and the A257 though
 the A257 was found to be slightly     
 busier - probably because of the      
 sizeable number of large villages     
 close-by(such as Littlebourne, Wingham
 and Preston).                         
 Few foreign cars or lorries were      
 observed partly because this is not a 
 major industrial area. The tourists   
 who come to Canterbury probably arrive
 by coach and the minority who come in 
 their own cars are likely to be       
 attracted to stay in the city rather  
 than tour the surrounding villages. .
