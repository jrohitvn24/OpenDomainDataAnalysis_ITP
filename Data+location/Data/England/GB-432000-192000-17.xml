		<title>17MIXED FARMING.</title>
		<content>The majority of farms are mixed; if    
market prices fluctuate the farmer has 
a steady income because of the variety 
of livestock and crops. Dairy and beef 
cattle are kept on most of the twelve  
farms. Two farms keep 1149 sheep. The  
fleeces, sheared by contractors, are   
sent to the Wool Marketing Board at    
Thame. Beef cattle are taken to the    
traditional fatstock markets of        
Banbury, Chippenham and Abingdon, dairy
cows to Chippenham and Banbury.        
Pedigree herds are sold by auction on  
the farms. Swindon market is used for  
beef and dairy calves. Sheep are bought
and sold at Banbury and the traditional
Vale market of Abingdon.There is little
interest in pigs, poultry or fruit.    
Five farms keep or breed horses for    
pleasure. Overall - small, mixed,      
grassland farms, arable land on        
lighter  Corallian soils.              </content>
