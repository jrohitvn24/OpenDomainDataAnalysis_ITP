		<title>10Shipley Parish Church today</title>
		<content> St. Mary's Church, Shipley, holds 2   
 Sunday services with an average Sunday
 congregation of 60. There are about 6 
 weddings and 8 christenings a year.   
 The choir has 3 male and 11 female    
 members and there are 12 ringers for  
 the church's 6 bells. The 15 strong   
 Parochial Church Council handles the  
 upkeep and management of the Church.  
 In 1984 major works to the belfry     
 were completed at a cost of Â£18,000. A
 monthly Parish Magazine gives details 
 of the Sunday School, St. Mary's Guild
 and Coffee Mornings held for those who
 live alone. The composer John Ireland 
 is buried in the churchyard. 1985 sees
 the{9th centenary of the Church}and in
 September celebrations, inaugurated by
 the Bishop of Chichester, will take   
 place at the Church. Rather unusual is
 the fact that sheep are allowed to    
 graze in the churchyard.              </content>
