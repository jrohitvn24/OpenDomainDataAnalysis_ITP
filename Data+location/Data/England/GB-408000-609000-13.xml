		<content> Tourism is second in importance to    
 agriculture in Northumberland and     
 vital to maintaining the areas economy
 The two main enterprises are farmhouse
 holidays and camping.                 
 Farmhouse holidays at Lumbylaw farm   
 cater for 6 to 12 persons staying on a
 weekly basis at a charge of #14 per   
 person per night. There is a high     
 demand for this accommodation between 
 May and October, with almost 100%     
 occupancy rate achieved. The majority 
 of visitors come from the south of    
 England and many return annually. They
 enjoy the openess of the countryside, 
 the beautiful beaches and well        
 preserved historic houses and castles.
