		<title>17  Amenities in Radcot area</title>
		<content> Being a scattered rural community     
there is a definite lack of amenities  
in this area. Mains electricity, TV and
telephone services are available but   
there is no piped gas supply, no mains 
water or mains drainage. The farmers   
have to pump water from their own wells
and pipe it to their farm cottages. The
public house is supplied by one of the 
farm systems. Each farm has to make its
own arrangements for sewage disposal.  
 There are three post boxes serving the
area, two along the main road, one in a
countrylane. The only meeting place is 
the public house. For visits to the    
doctor, shopping, entertainment etc.   
it is necessary to go to a nearby      
village or town. Although Faringdon is 
the nearer town people prefer to shop  
in Carterton, enjoying a trip to the   
weekly Thursday market.
