		<title>19A Family Sunday</title>
		<content>    We all usually get up at 9 o'clock 
 except my gran, she usually gets up   
 about 9.30.We get washed and dressed  
 and have breakfast, sometimes on a    
 Sunday we have bacon and eggs. After I
 have helped mum do the drying up I go 
 out to play.                          
    Most Sundays Dad washes the car and
 sometimes I help him.Then I go and    
 call for Elizabeth my friend who lives
 just over the road.When the day is    
 nice I sometimes take Tia,my grans    
 little dog,for a walk.If we're hungry 
 we have a snack or some ice cream,then
 I go out to play again.               
    At about 6 o'clock we have dinner  
 and I help wash up after that.Then we 
 go and watch television.At 7 o'clock  
 I have a bath and hair wash.At about  
 8 o'clock I go to bed.
