		<title>03The Stratford Canal</title>
		<content> A canal was built to link Birmingham  
 with Stratford in 1816.               
                                       
 It carried coal and goods from        
 Birmingham to Stratford.The barges    
 returned to Birmingham with farm      
 produce.                              
                                       
 After lorries were invented the canal 
 was not used much and fell into       
 disrepair.                            
                                       
 It was saved by the National Trust    
 whose volunteers restored it.It was   
 reopened in 1964 by the Queen Mother. 
                                       
 Tourists enjoy holidays on this quiet 
 waterway.
