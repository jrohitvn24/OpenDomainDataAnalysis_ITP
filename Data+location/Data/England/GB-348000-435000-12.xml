		<title>12Attitudes in Barton</title>
		<content>Although Barton has been part of the   
Borough of Preston for over ten years, 
it still retains its rural character.  
To reach Barton from the centre of     
Preston one has to pass through Fulwood
and Broughton and pass green fields.   
                                       
A few of the inhabitants of Barton can 
claim to have had ancestors in the     
village generations ago. Hovever, many 
have moved into the area in recent     
times and from more urban areas. They  
thus appreciate the rural scene.       
                                       
Although Barton is equidistant from    
Preston and the small town of          
Garstang, there seems to be greater    
allegiance to Garstang than to Preston 
even among those who work or once      
lived in the larger town.  For         
example, Preston Guild is ignored in   
favour of the Garstang processions.    </content>
