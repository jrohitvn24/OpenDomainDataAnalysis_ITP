     The Ministery of Agriculture and  
Fisheries' laboratory, in Kirkley, is  
the place where they study fish. Every 
day they measure fish and find out what
sort of food they eat. They find out   
how many fish there are in the sea and 
where  the best places to catch them   
are. They also find out how many       
fish are allowed to be caught every    
year. Every so often the people from   
the lab go on sea trips to find out    
other things about fish. Also at the   
lab they do research into fish farming 
including freshwater fish such as      
trout. They do this by breeding        
different sorts of fish, as well as    
lobsters, crabs and mussels.
