		<title>15LUDFORD _ BEE KEEPING</title>
		<content> JT has kept bees 45 years since a boy 
 describing himself as a Migratory Bee 
 Keeper. Has 150 Hives now on 4 nearby 
 sites for winter. In May when Oil Seed
 Rape flowers hives will move to those 
 fields and later to Bean Fields. Bees 
 welcomed by Farmers as they can incr_ 
 _ease crop by 15%.Farming changes _   
 disappearance of grazing and White    
 Clover means rape and beans are only  
 substitute. After beans have flowered 
 Hives move to N.Yorkshire Moors for   
 Heather crop.Heather enables bees to  
 provide their own food for winter they
 need 30 lbs _ and with luck give the  
 Bee Keeper a surplus _ Over a ton in  
 1984 but little in wet summer of 1985 
 when they had to be given 20 gallons  
 of sugar syrup to prevent starvation. 
 Bees very susceptible to farmers'     
 insecticide sprays _ 28 hives badly   
 damaged 1985 &amp; 100 Hives lost in 10 yr</content>
