		<title>07Farming around Bridport</title>
		<content>      Outside the built-up areas of    
 Bridport and West Bay most of the     
 countryside is farmland. Dairy        
 farming is the predominant type of    
 farming and so most fields are        
 intensively managed for pasture. Less 
 accessible areas and steep slopes are 
 mainly used for rough grazing by      
 horses as well as sheep and cattle.   
 Most of the horses are used for horse 
 riding especially for holiday makers  
 in the summer.                        
       Some of the larger fields  are  
 used for arable crops, but most       
 of the fields are quite small and     
 irregularly shaped with little        
 evidence  of  hedge removal. The      
 fields along the cliff-tops are       
 gradually getting smaller as erosion  
 causes the cliffs to slip.            
                                       
                                       </content>
