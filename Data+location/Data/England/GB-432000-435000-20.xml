		<content> Although most of Wyke Beck is covered 
 by culverts part of it runs through an
 area that is open to the land.        
 Unfortunately part of this beck has   
 become an unofficial tip. Work is     
 being carried out to tidy the beck.   
 There is evidence that plants, birds, 
 and animals are thriving in the area -
 buttercups, daisies, dandelions, and  
 forget-me-nots. In the area where the 
 land is rougher rose-bay willow herb, 
 nettles and thistles thrive.  There is
 also evidence of some fauna such as   
 water rats and a colony of frogs with 
 the resultant tadpoles in a smaller   
 area of the beck.  Birds are also     
 resident along the beck with the more 
 popular sparrows and starlings being  
 mixed with pied wagtails and swallows.
 The presence of small animals and     
 birds has attracted a kestrel which   
 can be seen hovering over head.       </content>
