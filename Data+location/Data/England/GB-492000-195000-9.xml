		<title>09AMERSHAM MUSEUM</title>
		<content>  Mr.Corns,a member of the Amersham    
 Society,(and a governor of our school)
 took us round a building in Amersham  
 which will be the museum.It was built 
 about 1450, probably the oldest house 
 in Amersham.Much of the 15th century  
 timber is still intact though it needs
 restoring.They need Â£100,000 to pay   
 for the house and repairs.            
 Now the collection is housed in a room
 in the British Legion hall which we   
 also visited.They have many unusual   
 things from people including farmer's 
 smocks, lace-making pillows and bob-  
 bins for making the famous Amersham   
 lace, old farmer's and farrier's tools
 a 1893 typewriter,and old sewing      
 machine,Victorian sewing sets.        
 There was a list of 38 different vers-
 ions of 'Amersham'from documents from 
 1066 to 1665.
