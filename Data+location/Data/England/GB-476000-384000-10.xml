		<content> The Reindeer Inn.                     
 The Reindeer Inn is the only public   
 house in Sturton and it has been      
 ownned by the same person for 21      
 years-Derek Ashton.His mother and     
 father still live in the village at   
 Low Holland.As there are no other     
 shops in the village he sells sweets  
 and soft drinks for the children to   
 buy.He sells 20,800 small cola bottles
 per annum.WHEN ever there is          
 afunction at the village hall then    
 MR ASHTON takes all the drinks and    
 beer up there in his trailer and      
 sets up the bar which has been built  
 into the new hall.MOST OF THE PEOPLE  
 who go to the pub come from the       
 village itself thogh some do travel   
 from other places but the             
 drink/drive laws do not encourage     
 this.
