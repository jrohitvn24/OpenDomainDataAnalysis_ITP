		<title>12Religion in Eccleshall</title>
		<content> There is a healthy attitude to rel-   
 igion in Eccleshall, and congregations
 appear to be thriving. The{Anglican   
 parish church of the Holy Trinity is  
 an imposing red snadstone building. A 
 modern vicarage and church room stand 
 nearby. The vicar also ministers to   
 the villages of Slindon and Offley    
 Hay. The{Roman Catholic}church of the 
 Sacred Heart has one priest in charge.
 There is a small convent attached.    
 Associated with the convent is        
 Broughton Hall, near Eccleshall, which
 is run by the Sisters and used as a   
 rest home. A brick-built Methodist    
 church in Stone Road has a community  
 room attached. The minister also      
 serves the villages of Gnosall, Woods-
 eaves and Bishop's Offley. A great    
 deal of community work is done by all 
 three churches.
