		<content> Highcroft Hall is a typical example of
 how the function of a large manor type
 house has changed.Highcroft Hall was  
 built in the 1870's for the           
 lady-in-waiting of Princess Eugenie   
 (the wife of Napolean III) in the     
 style of a French chateau.The house   
 was then sold to Edwin Vinson         
 a wealthy local farmer,who introduced 
 strawberries into Kent.He farmed a    
 large area around Crockenhill and was 
 a good employer.During this time the  
 cedar tree which still stands today   
 was thought to have been planted.The  
 hall was used by American and Polish  
 officers during WW2.The Hall then used
 a country club and today is a public  
 house and restaurant.The present      
 owners provide a number facilities for
 relaxation and entertainment including
 dancing,overnight accommodation,rooms 
 for private functionsand a varied menu</content>
