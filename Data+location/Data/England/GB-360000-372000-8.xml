		<content> The largest employer in the area is   
{ICI}at Winnington which employs close 
 to a thousand people. A second factory
 at Wallerscote closed in 1984.        
  Winnington ICI was started by John   
 Brunner and a German chemist, Ludwig  
 Mond. There is still a Brunner Library
 in Northwich.                         
  The major product of Winnington is   
 soda ash. Raw materials are brought in
 by river, road and via the large      
 railway sidings. When Wallerscote was 
 working, a single track railway, which
 still exists, connected the factory   
 with Weaverham, and from there to the 
 main line.                            
  The most important use of soda ash is
 in the manufacture of glass. The      
 replacement of glass by plastics was  
 one reason for the rundown of         
 Wallerscote works.
