		<content>  At Furneux Pelham every home in the  
 village has a television and some     
 homes have two or more sets. Mostly   
 people in the village watch television
 mainly to fill in the gaps between the
 times when they are not doing anything
 else.                                 
  On Saturdays and Sundays when the    
 programmes are not very good lots of  
 people do things like horse riding    
 and cycling which are popular hobbies.
  Sometimes people go to clubs like    
 Scouts, Brownies, tennis, drama and   
 swimming, but some people prefer to   
 stay indoors drawing or writing or    
 collecting things like stamps,        
 stickers, china animals or rubbers.   
  We don't often go to the pictures or 
 theatre but entertain one another in  
 our own homes like our parents.
