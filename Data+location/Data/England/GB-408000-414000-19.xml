		<title>19A Typical Day at School</title>
		<content>    When we come in at 09.00 we have   
 workshop, where we do all sorts of art
 work. Then at 10.15 we have playtime. 
 At 10.30 we come in and have assembly.
 Classes come in and listen to the     
 Headmaster, or have children show some
 work they have done. Then we come in  
 and do some S.M.P. maths with the     
 equipment.                            
    Dinner time is at 12.00 At 13.00 we
 come in and read. Then we do some     
 writing like a story or handwriting.  
    At 14.15 we have playtime and after
 play we have rounders.                
    PLAYTIME - We have two 15 minute   
 playtimes in a day. At playtime the   
 boys often play football and the girls
 play a game with a long piece of      
 elastic.                              
    Before we come in the teacher on   
 duty blows the whistle and all the    
 classes line up to go into school.    </content>
