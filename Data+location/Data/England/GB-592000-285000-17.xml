		<title>17Roudham, near Bridgham</title>
		<content> There is little remaining of the      
 former village of Roudham (lying about
 1 mile to the north of Bridgham), but 
 there are indications of its former   
 importance:  for example, there are 7 
 ways of approaching the hamlet, though
 today not all are accessible by       
 vehicle - perhaps the most interesting
 is the Old Drove Road (for sheep) to  
 the heathlands.  A thatched barn, 50  
 yards long, now being refurbished, is 
 the longest such structure in Norfolk.
 Whilst the church is a crumbling      
 shell, it is still consecrated and    
 used once a year.                     
                                       
 The area made a contribution to both  
 world wars, when army camps were      
 constructed.  Whilst the earlier camp 
 has been returned to agriculture, the 
 2nd world war area now houses a small 
 industrial estate, giving a few jobs. </content>
