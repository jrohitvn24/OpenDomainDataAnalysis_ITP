		<title>14Housing in Hannington</title>
		<content> There are three main categories of    
 housing:-                             
                                       
 (A) Privately Owned - 66%.            
                                       
 (B) Council Owned - 23% - including   
     bungalows built specifically for  
     the elderly.                      
                                       
 (C) Tied to Agriculture. - 11%.       
                                       
 There have been few new houses built  
 recently, as planning permission is   
 difficult to obtain. Many of the      
 Council houses have been bought &amp; now 
 privately owned, causing problems for 
 younger people who want to stay in the
 village, as private housing is very   
 expensive - both in the village and   
 surrounding area.Accordingly, deposits
 and mortgages for such people are     
 very hard to get.                     </content>
