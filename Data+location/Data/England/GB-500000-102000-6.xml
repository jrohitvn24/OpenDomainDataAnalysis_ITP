		<title>06A DAY AT FORD PRISON</title>
		<content> The prison at Ford is in buildings    
 which used to be part of a Royal      
 Navy Air Station.Other parts of the   
 Air Station are now an industrial     
 estate.                               
 The day begins with roll-call at      
 7.00am with breakfast at 7.30.Between 
 9.00 and 12.00 the prisoners do       
 "chores" which could be               
 gardening,cleaning up or moving       
 things.Lunch is at 12.00 and is       
 followed by "Freetime" when the men do
 more sports or gym or more chores.Five
 o'clock is tea-time and then the      
 prisoners do more chores until the    
 7.00pm roll-call.Supper at 8.00pm is  
 usually something like bangers and    
 mash.The prisoners have to go to bed  
 at 9 o'clock and "lights out" is at   
 10.00.
