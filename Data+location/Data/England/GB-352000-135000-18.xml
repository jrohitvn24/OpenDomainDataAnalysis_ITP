		<title>18West Bradley Church &amp; House</title>
		<content> The church dedication is unknown. It  
 has a Norman font with a plain round  
 bowl which is older than the present  
 building itself. Dating from the      
 fourteenth century are the nave,      
 chancel, west tower and south porch,  
 the latter having a fifteenth century 
 roof. The whole building was restored 
 in 1873. It has three bells, two      
 dating from 1706 and one from 1815.   
                                       
 Bradley House, situated to the east   
 of the church, is an unusual tower-   
 like building  with an incongruous    
 roof. It is probably of Tudor origin  
 but was much altered in the eighteenth
 century. There are the original       
 mullioned windows in the basement and 
 part of the moat is still impressive. 
 The house is now the centre of an     
 extensive orchard planting.
