		<content>  The area is well served with public  
 transport networks in the form of the 
 Wandle District of London Transport   
 and British Rail.                     
   The area is criss-crossed by bus    
 routes into Sutton, Morden, Croydon,  
 Banstead, Wallington, Kingston and    
 Wimbledon amongst other places. They  
 help to keep links with British Rail  
 and other areas in this essentially   
 commuter zone of South West London.   
 British Rail has direct lines to      
 London Bridge, Victoria, and Waterloo 
 via Wimbledon. Many people in the     
 area own cars and use this as their   
 main form of transport.Many also had  
 bicycles but were not keen on riding  
 them on the roads in this area because
 of traffic congestion and atmospheric 
 pollution.
