 The children of this school also found
 that Roby Church contains a unique    
 series of oak panels brought from the 
 Netherlands by one of the Earls of    
 Derby.The Church records acknowledge  
 the receipt of these panels and state 
 that they were intended for a boat    
 house, but, because of their religious
 significance, the Earl gave them to   
 Roby Church.The church has a spire    
 with a peal of bells used for the     
 announcement of Sunday services.Around
 the church is a graveyard with some   
 graves dating back over 100           
 years.Entrance to the graveyard is via
 a lych gate.
