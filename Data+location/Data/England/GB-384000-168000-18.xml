		<title>18LEISURE IN CORSHAM</title>
		<content>  Most people we asked said, "There's  
 nothing to do in Corsham". We found   
 this was not true. There is a wide    
 range of activities for all ages if   
 you bother to look.                   
  We found weight training and swimming
 at the pool. Youth clubs, evening     
 classes, play school and luncheons are
 all held at the Mansion House.        
  The Squash Centre has two main       
 sports, squash and keep fit. At the   
 fire station they hold a skittles     
 evening on Fridays. At the Corsham    
 Community Centre they hold discos,    
 skittles, dances and concerts.        
  The Corsham Cricket ground is used   
 for cricket in the summer and hockey  
 in the winter.                        
  Twice a year the fair comes for three
 or four days. There was once a cinema 
 but that closed about five years ago.
