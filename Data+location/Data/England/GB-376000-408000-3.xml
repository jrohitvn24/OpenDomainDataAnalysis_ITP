		<content> Two people were interviewed about how 
 life has changed over the last 50     
 years in North Radcliffe.We discovered
 that Radcliffe used to be a thriving {
{spinning}and {weaving}community with  
 several{coal mines. }Both these       
 industries have disappeared. The      
 little industry that is left is{light 
{manufacturing.}In the past most       
 people worked close to home,but now   
 most people have to travel outside    
 the area to work.{School}life has also
 seen many changes.The curriculum      
 includes many more interesting        
 subjects these days.Most families in  
 our area have at least one car.Gone   
 are the trams and extensive{railway   
{networks.}There used to be two        
 stations,now there are none.The       
 landscape has changed over the past 50
 years as several new housing estates  
 have been built.                      </content>
