		<title>14The Priory Now Cont</title>
		<content> Inside the southern edge of the       
 perimiter fence there is a small hut. 
 The priory is very isolated except for
 the farmhouse which was not built     
 until later. The kitchen is next to   
 the small hut. The walls for the      
 priory are made strong with big stones
 on the outside and smaller stones on  
 the inside. There is a grinding stone 
 inthe priory. The fence was given by  
 the Ministry of Works. The priory's   
 stones are smooth the the pillar is   
 well shaped and carved. There is a    
 small trough in which water would have
 been stored. The surrounding land is  
 owned by the Laws. The farmhouse      
 belongs to the Laws and has recently  
 been lived in but is now derelict.
