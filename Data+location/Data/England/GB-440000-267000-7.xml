		<title>07Modern Farming in Marton.</title>
		<content> We visited a local farm of about 250  
 acres to discover how the farmer of   
 1985 manages his land.The farm was    
 highly mechanised with machinery      
 available for sowing,harvesting,drying
 and transport.All the machinery was   
 expensive and we realised how much    
 time and money is spent keeping it in 
 good working order. There was a       
 combine harvester which cuts the      
 harvest,separates the grain from the  
 straw and collects the crop.The straw 
 is later baled. The baler is drawn by 
 one of the tractors.The farmer no     
 longer relies on the sun to dry his   
 hay.It is baled and brought into a    
 special shed where it is blown dry.   
 This makes a better quality of hay.The
 cattle are milked by machinery and    
 their yield is carefully measured.    
 During milking each cow is given a    
 carefully calculated amount of cake.  </content>
