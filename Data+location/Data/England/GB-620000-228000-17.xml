		<content> When we did a survey within our school
 we were surprised to find that almost 
 a fifth of the Parents had{Jobs}which 
 were in some way connected to the sea.
 In our particular area there was no   
 very high rate of unemployment,in fact
 we were lucky because our rate is well
 below the national average,while only 
 15 miles away it is twice as high as  
 ours.                                 
 The{types}of jobs which people had    
 were Seamen,Customs officers,Lorry    
 drivers,Caterers,Light industrial     
 work,and some were Agricultural       
 workers,although this number had      
 fallen and was still falling due to   
 increasing mechanisation,of very large
 farms.
