		<title>12FAMILY LIFE - a Sunday</title>
		<content>{Sunday 21st April 1985}               
 Last Sunday everyone got up at 8.30am 
 and had breakfast. Mum went to get the
 paper from the shop, then she went to 
 church for the 9.30am service. Andrew 
 and I played snooker, while Paul      
 played cars, and Dad made some train  
 mountains for our model railway. After
 lunch Dad made some bread, and Andrew 
 and I played football outside, while  
 Paul played with his Lego building    
 bricks. At 5.00pm everyone had tea.   
 For tea we had sandwiches, cakes and  
 an orange drink. Then Andrew, Paul and
 I went outside to play. At 7.30pm we  
 had supper, and read a book until     
 8.30pm, when we went to bed.          
 Meanwhile, my parents wallpapered the 
 lounge and watched television.
