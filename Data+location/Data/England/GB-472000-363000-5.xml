		<title>05TRANSPORT AROUND OSSINGTON.</title>
		<content>    Most of the families in the block  
 own their own{transport,}for example a
{car}or{motorcycle,}some even have two 
 or more vehicles in order for them to 
 travel around.                        
    The{bus service}is most inadequate 
 only{two buses per week}to and from   
{Newark,}which is approximately nine   
 miles away,  therefore some means of  
 personal transport is necessary if a  
 person needs to travel out of the     
 area.                                 
    However the education authority    
 ensures that there is essential       
{transport}for{school children.        
    There are no major roads in this   
 block, the few that are there are     
 minor country roads.
