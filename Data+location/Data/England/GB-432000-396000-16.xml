		<title>16Shopping in Chapeltown.</title>
		<content> Shopping patterns in Chapeltown have  
 altered radically since ASDA opened,  
 bringing 'One stop shopping'. The     
 superstore opened in 1976. 75% of     
 local people in our survey use it at  
 least once a week. Station Road, with 
 its individual, specialised shops, has
 become a backwater, with frequent     
 changes of ownership and goods sold.  
 ASDA's positioning is good, with      
 public transport facilities nearby,   
 although most people prefer to use    
 private transport. One criticism is of
 the positioning of the loading bay -  
 causing traffic congestion in the     
 centre of Chapeltown, especially on   
 Market days, Tuesdays and Fridays.    
 The people surveyed were generally    
 satisfied with the shopping facilities
 although it was felt a shoe shop was  
 badly needed.                         
                                       </content>
