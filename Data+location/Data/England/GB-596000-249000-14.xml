		<content>Then we went out to play on the field. 
We have dancing in the afternoon in the
hall. The girls wear a blue band so    
they can see who are the boys! My best 
dance is 'Four Around Four' but we all 
like 'I want to be near you'. Then we  
did our English before going out to    
play. Some children go to recorders but
the better players go on Thursday lunch
time. All the rest listen to a story.  
We have prayers and go home. I walk but
some go on a mini-bus, a big bus or in 
a car. After tea I put on my nighty,   
cleaned my teeth and went to bed.
