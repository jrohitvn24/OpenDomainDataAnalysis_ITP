		<title>08The Combine Harvester</title>
		<content>   Most of the farms around Great      
 Dunmow are arable and therefore need  
 a great deal of machinery.            
   The combine harvester is used for   
 harvesting the crop. This it does by  
 first separating the head of corn from
 the straw. The head or ear of corn is 
 fed by the trunk head into the drum.  
 The drum then rotates very quickly to 
 thrash the seed out of the chaff. Next
 the seed falls onto a seive and as the
 seed goes through the seive a jet of  
 air blows the chaff out the back of   
 the combine and pure seed goes into   
 the tank. With a price of about       
 Â£40,000 and more, combines have to be 
 versatile.  With slight alterations   
 the average combine can cut oil seed  
 rape, barley, wheat, peas and beans.  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
