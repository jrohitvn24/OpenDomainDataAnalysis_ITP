		<title>01The Northwich Area</title>
		<content> We are in a pleasant,semi rural area,a
 few miles south of Northwich.It       
 consists of 3 compact village         
 communities (Davenham,Moulton and     
 Leftwich) Whose origins stretch back  
 to before the Norman Conquest.It      
 conveniently encompasses major        
 road,rail and water routes to the     
 nearby cities of Chester,Manchester,  
 Warrington and Crewe,where many people
 commute to work.Housing is very varied
 in size,style and age ranging from    
 expensive,detached homes to more      
 modest council terraces.Some          
 properties are Georgian or            
 mid-Victorian.                        
  Most of the local farming is dairy.  
 Our block includes 3 Primary schools,1
 Secondary school,1 Fire Station,6     
 Churches ,6 Public Houses,2 Homes for 
 the elderly and a variety of small    
 shops.                                </content>
