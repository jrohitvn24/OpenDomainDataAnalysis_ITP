		<content>   My alarm goes off at 7:00am.I get   
 dressed and go downstairs.I feed the  
 ponies and let the ducks out while Mum
 is getting the breakfast.I have cereal
 or a boiled egg.I pack my books and we
 leave for school taking my sister into
 Ross to get a lift to her school.     
 Sometimes we do shopping on the way.  
   School starts at 9:15am.We do Maths 
 and English then we have a break and  
 then work until lunchtime.We often    
 have chips,fish fingers and beans and 
 for pudding we have mousse.At 1:05pm  
 we start work again,we have Geography 
 and Games and at 3:15pm I go home.    
   At 5:30pm I have my tea then I go   
 riding on my pony and I walk the dog.I
 go and watch television for a while   
 till bedtime at 9:00pm.But by the time
 I get in bed it's usually later.
