		<content> For the{first time},in 1985 a steam   
 rally  was held at Parham Park ,near  
 Storrington.There were traction       
 engines in steam together with        
 historic fair organs,vintage          
 cars,bicycles and motor-bikes. There  
 were working scale models,country     
 craft stalls,local charity stand car  
 boot sales.The two day event was such 
 a sucsess that the organizer is       
 suggesting that it becomes an annual  
 event.                                
 At Christmas-time the churches unite  
 to sing carols round the tree in the  
 square.
