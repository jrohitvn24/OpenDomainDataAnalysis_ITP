		<title>10Garretts Farm - Eastchurch</title>
		<content>   Garretts Farm is typical of the     
 farms in the Eastchurch area. The     
 present owner has farmed the{land}for 
 seventeen years. It covers an area of 
 270 acres and is largely arable land  
 apart from the presence of 50{sheep   
 which will go at the end of this year.
 The climate and soil are particularly 
 suitable for growing{crops,}mainly    
 wheat, potatoes and peas.             
    The original farmhouse was built   
 300 years ago with additions made at a
 later date. There have been changes in
 the use of the land recently as       
 orchards were removed and better      
 drainage meant more intensive{farming.
    The farmer has recently aquired the
 land only from Trouts Farm on the     
 other side of the road.
