		<content> There are few facilities in the area  
 for recreation, although a number of  
 beaches and coastal resorts are not   
 too far distant and the nearby town of
 Barnstaple does offer a Leisure Centre
 to which many of the local people     
 travel to engage in such pursuits as  
 swimming, bowls, squash or gymnasium  
 activities.                           
   One interesting local facility in   
 the village of Shirwell itself is the 
 bowling alley which is inside an old, 
 wooden railway carriage-once part of  
 the rolling stock of the Great Western
 Railway.                              
   In the tourist season, pony treks   
 take place at a local farm.           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
