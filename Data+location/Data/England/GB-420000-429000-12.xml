		<content>       Eighteen months ago the landlady
 at the Old Duke William introduced a  
 light meal service of quick grills,   
 sandwiches chips and salads.  This is 
 most popular at lunch time although it
 is available in the evenings.         
   On Monday evenings there is a       
 special games night for the darts and 
 dominoes specialists.  Country and    
 Western style music is provided on    
 Wednesday evenings for the over 23 age
 group and there is a" Golden Oldie"   
 Discoe on Saturdays which caters for  
 all ages.                             
   Many people celebrate special       
 occasions at the pub such as 21st     
 birthdays and retirement parties-,    
 sitting together as a group and buying
 drinks and sometimes food for their   
 guests.                               
   The landlady feels that most people 
 go to a pub for company and a chat.   </content>
