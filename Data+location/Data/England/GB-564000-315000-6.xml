		<content>  North Runcton school closed a few    
 years ago when there were only about  
 ten pupils left, but the{Primary}     
 school at Middleton has 90 pupils and 
 four teachers.                        
  Children start at the school when    
 they are five years old. When they    
 are 11 they transfer to Gaywood Park  
 High School in Kings Lynn. There is a 
 free school bus to take children to   
 and from the high school.             
  Middleton school takes children from 
 Middleton parish (including Fair      
 Green and Blackborough End) and a few 
 children from North Runcton. The      
 children walk or cycle to school or   
 are brought in cars by parents.       
  35 children have{school meals}which  
 are cooked at North Wootton and       
 brought to the school in containers by
 taxi. The school has one dinner lady  
 to serve meals and clear up.          </content>
