		<content>     We visited CENTRAL GARAGE,which is
 owned by MR G MEADEN.It is the only   
 garage in the village.We were shown   
 around by his daughter MRS CHRISTA    
 VEAL.In February 1985, she became the 
 first lady to qualify as a MINISTRY   
 OF TRANSPORT VEHICLE EXAMINER in      
 Dorset.                               
     She showed us how she does the    
 M.O.T.Test,which includes checking the
 alignment of the headlights,testing   
 the brakes on a roller machine,looking
 at the components under the bonnet and
 examining underneath the car for rust 
 and corrosion.                        
     She has recently obtained her     
 P.S.V. Licence and is now trying for  
 her H.G.V. Licence.                   
     Besides servicing and repairing   
 vehicles,Central Garage also sell     
 U.K. Petrol.
