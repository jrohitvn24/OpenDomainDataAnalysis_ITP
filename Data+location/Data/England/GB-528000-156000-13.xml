		<content>    Crane Hill was commisioned in 1833 
 and is now owned by Bromley Health    
 Authority. There are 643 patients with
 300 nurses in 40 wards. These are     
 named after famous people in the      
 nineteenth century. There are many    
 separate buildings for the different  
 functions such as a swimming pool,    
 launderette and hairdressers. There is
 also a large church. The hospital used
 to have a large farm where the        
 patients worked with hens, cows,      
 horses, and sheep. Now patients are   
 gradually being integrated into the   
 local community, as Crane Hill may be 
 closing in the 1990's.                
 Coulsdons residents are very concerned
 about this possibility.               
   The church of St.John the Evangelist
 has been in Old Coulsdon since Saxon  
 times and is mentioned in the Domesday
 Book of 1086.                         </content>
