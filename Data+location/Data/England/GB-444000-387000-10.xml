  Ulley is a tiny village in South     
 Yorkshire.Not many people live there  
 because it is surrounded by fields.Two
 farms can be found in Ulley itself.One
 is called West End Farm and the other 
 is Ulley Hall Farm.West End farm is a 
 mixed farm with cows and cereal crops.
 Ulley Hall farm is an arable farm.    
 These farms are a few hundred metres  
 apart on either edge of the           
 village.The village has a church that 
 is used quite often but has a very    
 small congregation.The bus service is 
 not very frequent:three buses,four    
 days a week Monday,Wednesday,Friday   
 and Saturday.                         
       A small Post Office can be found
 on the main street and nearby is The  
 Royal Oak Public House where          
 refreshment and meals can be obtained.
