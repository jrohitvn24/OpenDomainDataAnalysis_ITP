		<content> The Brewery Site was once used for    
 making beer and then as a warehouse.

 there.The types are called Ashurst,   
 Kemsing,Linton,Pembury,Smarden and    
 Teston.The Ashurst is a 4 bedroomed   
 detached house.The Kemsing is a 2     
 bedroomed detached bungalow.The       
 Pembury is a 2 bedroomed semi_detached
 house.The Smarden is a 3 bedroomed    
 detached house.The Teston is a 2 or 3 
 bedroomed detached house.The Linton is
 a 4 bedroomed detached house.Hillreeds
 make all different houses so it       
 doesn't look boring.Altogether the    
 total units on the site are 118.The   
 Brewery itself is being made into 43  
 homes.The stables have been bought    
 privately to be converted into three,2
 bedroomed homes, and the offices are  
 being made into a 4 bedroomed home.The
 houses cost from Â£30,000 to Â£80,000.  </content>
