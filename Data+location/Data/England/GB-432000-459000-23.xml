The fishery at Farnham has closed, as has the Golf Driving Range at Scotton. We now have a cricket pitch with pavilion in the village (paid for by Bryant Homes when the original cricket pitch was built on to create part of the Appleby Estate). There is a football pitch on Percy Field, used by Scotton Scorchers Football Club and the School. The Village Hall also provides a well-used facility for numerous activities including, badminton, keep-fit, bowls, dancing classes and art classes. As well as a meeting place for groups such as the Mothers Union. We have two holiday caravan parks.&lt;br />&lt;br />Leisure activities in Farnham include; village suppers, Ladies tea meetings, reading, walking and wine appreciation groups. Brearton still has a Village Hall with events throughout the year. All three villages have churches and there is a chapel in Scotton.   &lt;br />
