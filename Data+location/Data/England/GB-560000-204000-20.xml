		<title>20HOME FARM COOKSMILL GREEN</title>
		<content> This is an{arable farm}of about 500   
 acres but it also has a{fattenning    
{unit}for 420 bulls.They are bought at 
 3 months and are ready for slaughter  
 at 14 months.They are fed once a day  
 and can eat as much as they want.Some 
 of the barley grown on the farm is    
 used for feeding.Other food such as   
 potato peelings is bought.They are al-
 so given molasses,silage and vitamin  
 compounds.They are kept close together
 and never leave their pens.Sometimes  
 they get diseases like ringworm but as
 this doesn't affect the meat it is not
 treated.It clears up by itself in the 
 end.Nearly all the bulls are Friesians
 There is a small reservoir which was  
 made following dry summers.It was sub-
 sidized from public funds but now it  
 is let to a local fishing club.It has 
 never been used for the purpose of ir-
 rigating potato crops in dry weather. </content>
