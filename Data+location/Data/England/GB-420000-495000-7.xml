		<title>07A VILLAGE COMMUNITY-TUNSTALL</title>
		<content> Tunstall is a small village with      
 approximately 190 residents. It is a  
 long narrow village divided by a road 
 and a stream. In the centre of the    
 village are the church, the village   
 shop and the public house. At one end 
 of the village is a small neat council
 housing estate, the majority of other 
 houses are owner occupied. The        
 emphasis is on family life with the   
 welfare of the children being of prime
 importance. Fresh food is produced in 
 gardens and cooked in modernised      
 kitchens, many having microwave ovens.
 Time consuming chores are cut to a    
 minimum to allow the family to have   
 time together, watching television and
 videos. Board games are still very    
 popular for indoors and sport is a    
 favourite outdoor pursuit. Many       
 families have a household pet, dogs   
 proving to be the most popular.       </content>
