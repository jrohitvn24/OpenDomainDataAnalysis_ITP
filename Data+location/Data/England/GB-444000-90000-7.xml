		<title>07HANDSPINNING IN PORCHFIELD.</title>
		<content> My interests are crochet, dressmaking,
 painting, knitting by machine and     
 spinning.My new spinning chair was    
 made in Porchfield by a craftsman,    
 also my Niddy Noddy, bobbins and drop 
 spindles.I use the fleece of the rare 
 Manx Loughton sheep which is a light  
 brown and gold.I also use Jacob       
 fleece,dog's hair etc.I use natural   
 vegetation for dyeing fleece various  
 colours.When the wool has been spun   
 the yarn is used for knitting jumpers,
 weaving of rugs and felting.I also use
 the drop spindle which once was the   
 only means of spinning yarn.Nowadays  
 the spinning wheel can be replaced    
 with an electric motor.My Husband has 
 made an electric spinner for me.
