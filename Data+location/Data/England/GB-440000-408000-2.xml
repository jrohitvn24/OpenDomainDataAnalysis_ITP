		<title>02Grimethorpe- Environment</title>
		<content>  Grimethorpe{is for the most part     
{surrounded by woods and open fields.  
 You can turn your back on the dirt and
 smoke of industry and see a completely
 different world.There are beautiful   
 rolling hills and pleasant woods      
 teeming with wildlife of all kinds.   
 Many public footpaths enter           
 Grimethorpe from all directions-      
 trodden by the early miners.There is  
 a{Nature Trail in Howell Wood}with a  
 part-time warden.Many footpaths lead  
 to the Common Land on Brierley-Great  
 Houghton Commons.This common land was 
 very much larger until the 39-45 war  
 when it was put to the plough.It has  
 not yet been returned to the people.  
  The countryside provides a ready     
 source of enviromental education for  
 schools and well used leisure         
 facilities for adults and children.
