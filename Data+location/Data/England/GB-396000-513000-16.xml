		<title>16The Village Shop</title>
		<content> Bowes has two shops.Brown's Store is  
 open part-time and sells fancy goods  
 and confectionary with some craft     
 goods.The other is also the sub       
 postoffice.The two facets of this are 
 complementary and one may not be able 
 to exist in isolation.As government   
 agencies seek to pay pensions and     
 allowances monthly into bank accounts 
 so the number of transactions that    
 take place in the sub postoffice and  
 hence its income drops.Many people    
 still shop daily at the sub postoffice
 but shopping patterns are changing and
 families with personal transport often
 shop weekly or monthly at large       
 supermarkets to try to save money.this
 decline in custom has led to the      
 closure of many small units in rural  
 areas.A County Durham Association of  
 Rural Shopkeepers has just been formed
 to give support to reverse this trend.</content>
