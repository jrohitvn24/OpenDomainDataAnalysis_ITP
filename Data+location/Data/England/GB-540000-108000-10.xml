		<title>10  BONFIRE  IN  LEWES</title>
		<content>      Lewes' six{Bonfire Societies}take
 over the streets on November 5th. Led 
 by brass bands and lit by thousands of
 flaming torches, adults and children  
 march around the town in superb       
{costumes. Flaming tar barrels}are     
 tossed in the river and the{burning   
{effigy}of a sixteenth century Pope is 
 a reminder that fourteen  Protestants 
 were martyred in Lewes during the     
 Marian Persecution of the l6th century
      Then huge{bonfires}are lit on the
 edge of town accompanied by elaborate 
{firework displays,}and an effigy of an
 unpopular modern figure is exploded.  
      People come to watch from miles  
 around, and those 2000 Lewesians who  
 are Bonfire members spend the rest of 
 the year raising funds and meeting    
 to create fabulous costumes:{Cliffe:  
 Cavaliers and Vikings;{Commercial     
{Square:}Cowboys and Indians.          </content>
