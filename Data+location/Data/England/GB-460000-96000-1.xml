		<content> :     Our area is part of the south   
 coast. It is mainly residential,half  
 of our 'D'block is sea and half is    
 land. Our block is quite old, most of 
 the houses date from the early 20th   
 century and some are even 400 years   
 old.                                  
      Much of the landscape has been   
 used for defence, for example Fort    
 Gilkicker, Fort Monckton, Spitsand    
 Fort. All these were used to protect  
 Gosport and Portsmouth Harbour. Now   
 they are used (apart from Spitsand) by
 the Ministry of Defence.              
      Included in the western edge of  
 our 'D' block is Alverstoke,now a     
 popular residential area, but was more
 important in the past. We also have a 
 small corner of Portsmouth,which      
 includes Southsea Common.
