		<content>  In Willoughby lives a man who has    
 been at the forefront of nature con-  
 servation (see Biography) and he and  
 his wife have been instrumental in    
 improving the ecology of the area.    
  There are two areas designated as of 
 importance,a meadow on the outskirts  
 of Willoughby and an old quarry in    
 Claxby.                               
  The meadow has in it 117 different   
 species of wild flower and is a good  
 example of how grassland was until the
 advent of modern farming techniques.  
  The quarry was active until a few    
 years ago and chalk was quarried      
 there.The last foreman,Mr.Hildred,re- 
 tired to the village.When in charge   
 of the workings,he and his wife lived 
 in a wooden bungalow at the pit       
 entrance.There was also a blacksmith's
 shop there and lime-kilns,the remains 
 of which can still be seen.           </content>
