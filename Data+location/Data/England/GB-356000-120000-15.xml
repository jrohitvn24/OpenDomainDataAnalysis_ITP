		<title>15CHILTON CANTELO CHURCH.</title>
		<content> Chilton Cantelo Church is a wonder to 
 look at.Henry Goodford had a beautiful
 mosaic floor installed by Italians.At 
 one end of the church there are metal 
 plaques in memory of the Goodfords.The
 church was adapted by the Normans when
 they came in 1066.Added to the west   
 end is a late 14th century tower.     
 1864 Rev. Goodford rebuilt the church 
 almost like new .The floor under the  
 pews is original 19th century oak,the 
 pulpit,alter,choirstands and church   
 screen are also made of the same oak. 
 The inside walls are made of hamstone.
 The only tomb in the church contains  
 the headless body of Theophilus Broome
 who was killed in the Civil War in the
 17th century. The body was exhumed in 
 the late 19th century to prove this.  
 The skull is kept in the Farm House   
 across the road. All attempts to bury 
 the head with the body fail.          </content>
