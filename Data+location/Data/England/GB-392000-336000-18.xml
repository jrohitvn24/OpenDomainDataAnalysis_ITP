{MILLS}The Moddershall Valley had 7    
mills but these have all closed in the 
last half of this century.             
At Splashy mill (Grid Ref 920367)      
calcined flints from the flint kiln    
would be pushed along in trucks, along 
the plate-way to a point below a trap- 
door in the first floor of the mill.   
Here they were poured into the base of 
the pan, made of silicon stone and the 
upper stone positioned by water power  
to grind down into a watery creamy     
fluid which was then piped to a        
settling ARK.When the major water had  
evaporated it was then dried in a kiln.</content>
