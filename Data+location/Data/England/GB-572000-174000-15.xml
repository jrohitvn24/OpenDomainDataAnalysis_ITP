Oakleigh farm and Oakleigh lodge are   
surrounded by good farming land. The   
land is well drained and leads into a  
big pond behind the farm house. The    
farm has a big barn shelter with much  
machinery.The farm itself grows mostly 
cereal crops with a few vegetables and 
strawberries.Rough grazing land is also
there for livestock. Cereals that are  
grown are principally wheat and barley,
the vegetables growing were cabbages,  
leeks and potatoes.On the grazing land 
were horses and cattle.Some work is    
provided by the farm by picking the    
crops.A disused railway runs through   
the farm giving it an embankment       
separating the rough grazing area from 
the remaining land.A new feature of the
landscape is a reservoir probably built
as an aid to farming.
