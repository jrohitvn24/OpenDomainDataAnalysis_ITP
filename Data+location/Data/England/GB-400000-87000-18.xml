		<title>18Brownsea Nature Trail</title>
		<content> The whole of the North-east section of
 Brownsea is normally closed to the    
 public in order to protect wild-life. 
 However a 1\ hour guided tour of the  
{Nature Reserve}takes place every      
 afternoon at 14.45 hours. About 6000  
 people a year go on this nature trail.
 On the afternoon of Sunday 14th. July 
 1985 21 adults and 6 children         
 accompanied the guide to see woodland,
 marsh, a salt-water lagoon and two    
 lakes, which provide a sanctuary for  
 ducks, geese and waders, as well as   
 herons, black-headed gulls and terns. 
 Dogs are not allowed on the island, in
 case they attack the birds. There is  
 also the hazard of fire. The last     
 great blaze on Browsea was in 1934    
 when two-thirds of the island was     
 ravaged so there is now a fire-tower  
 at a vantage point in the middle of   
 the island.                           </content>
