		<title>05The Manor House at Ashbury.</title>
		<content>  The Manor house was built in 1488.It 
is made from Chalk, Sarsen stone,      
Bricks , solid Oak timber and  a Tiled 
roof.The Spences family live there.    
Their names are Willam, Tom, Mary and  
their parents Jenny and Jim Spence.    
They have lived there 10 weeks but MR. 
J.Spence grew up there as a boy. There 
are 12 rooms in the manor and they are 
all used sometimes .There are 4        
chimmney pots and stacks.They own 2    
vehicles but because it is a farm it   
has lots of tractors and Farm          
Machinery (for more information see    
farms ). Before it was a house it was  
a Rest House  for monks  travlling     
from  Oxford to Avebury.The front Door 
is very old ,Mr.Spence thinks it's the 
original door. There are  27 windows   
in the house.The garden is 2 acres     
incuding the Orchard.It was owned by   
the craven Estate.                     </content>
