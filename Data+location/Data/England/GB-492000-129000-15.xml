		<title>15CHILDREN'S LEISURE TIME</title>
		<content>  Children take part in sporting       
 activities like their parents.Some of 
 them belong to organisations such as  
 Scouts,Guides,Cubs or Brownies and go 
 to weekly meetings and learn how to   
 purposefully use their leisure time.  
 Many families have computers and so   
 taking part in computer games consumes
 a great deal of leisure time.         
  Because of the lack of public        
 transport in this area and the        
 isolation of many of the properties,  
 children have to rely on their parents
 to take them to organised activities. 
 If parents are not able or inclined to
 transport their children the teenagers
 especially become extremely bored and 
 have much time on their hands.
