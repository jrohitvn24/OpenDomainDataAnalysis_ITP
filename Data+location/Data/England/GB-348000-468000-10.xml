		<title>10TYPES OF HOUSES IN CARNFIRTH</title>
		<content>    We counted over 1,300 houses in    
 Carnforth.                            
  10.34% are Detached Bungalows.       
   1.53% are Semi-Detached Bungalows.  
   6.51% are Flats.                    
  50.20% are Terraced Houses.          
   6.90% are Detached Houses.          
  24.52% are Semi-Detached Houses.     
 The large{Council Estate}consists     
 mainly of semi-detached houses with   
 some flats. The newest estate is the  
{Whelmar Estate}of private det. houses 
 and bungalows.{North Road,}the oldest 
 road, used to be the main road and is 
 mainly terraced cottages. Carnforth   
 grew quickly with the coming of the   
{Ironworks}and the{Railway,}which      
 probably accounts for the large number
 of terraced houses. The oldest houses 
 in Carnforth are{10 Lower North Road  
{(1688-formerly Miller's Lane)}and{Hagg
{House}built in{1638.}                 </content>
