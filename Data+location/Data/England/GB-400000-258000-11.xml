		<title>11CLUBS - HOLBERROW GREEN</title>
		<content> The nearby Young Farmers Club attracts
 people from a wide circle, they come  
 together on social evenings to enjoy  
 each others company and usually listen
 to a talk given by an outside speaker 
 on a variety of subjects, not         
 necessarily connected with farming.   
                                       
 In addition they organise             
 competitions amongst themselves and   
 other young farmers groups often      
 including old crafts which they are   
 anxious to 'keep alive' a part of our 
 heritage. These include ploughing,    
 hedging and ditching, stock judging   
 and poultry trussing.                 
                                       
 Members have the opportunity to make  
 overseas visits and these are         
 orgainised at both county and national
 level. Those lucky enough to be chosen
 have their expenses paid for them.    </content>
