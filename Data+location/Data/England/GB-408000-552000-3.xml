		<content> Mr Gibson is a friendly bachelor who  
 has lived in Medomsley all of his life
 and loves the village,its people and  
 nature.What annoys him most is the    
 increased vandalism of our village.   
     He has had a happy life working   
 since he was 16 on the land, and      
 building up his own market garden     
 business and rearing cattle on his    
 land.Life was tough,but with a 12 hour
 day he was his own boss.From tractor  
 to van,he sold his produce around the 
 village.He has seen many changes,     
 enjoying tarmac roads and the bus     
 service,but rejected electricity and  
 television.He loves natural things.   
     In his retirement he reads,gardens
 and travels on local bus routes.He is 
 a great churchman and was a governor  
 of our school for 22 years.As a boy he
 liked marzipan bars,meccano,woodwork  
 and gardening.                        </content>
