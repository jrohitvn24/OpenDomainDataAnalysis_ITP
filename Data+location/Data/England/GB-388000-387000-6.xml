		<title>06UKRAINIAN CLUB, STOCKPORT</title>
		<content>   There are about 300 Ukrainians in   
 the area. There are 70-80 male and 10 
 female members of the club, who enjoy 
{folk dancing,}keep-fit and sport      
 events.                               
   You have to be over 18 to join but  
 infants go along on Saturday mornings.
 The{Christmas traditions}are very     
 different from our own. There is no   
 Nativity play but a play called       
 "Vertep". They eat a 12 dish meal on  
 January 6th - their Christmas Eve.    
 Then the children hang out pillow     
 cases and their Christmas lasts 12    
 days.                                 
   In the Ukraine today,there are about
 50 millon people. The Ukrainians came 
 to Britain during the second World War
 and did not go back. The women arrived
 after being in slave labour in        
 Germany.The club allows the Ukrainians
 to keep their language and customs.   </content>
