		<title>08TOURISM IN MID DEVON</title>
		<content> The area is in the centre of Devon    
 and                                   
 visitors with cars can explore north  
 and south coasts of the county and    
 Cornwall. Dartmoor is within easy     
 reach, Exmoor and Bodmin can be       
 visited as can several National Trust 
 properties and other tourist          
 attractions of the S.W. Many of the   
 farms in the area offer bed and       
 breakfast or have converted out-      
 buildings as holiday flats with the   
 aid of a grant. There are also several
 cottages which are let to holiday-    
 makers. Tourism is thus becoming      
 important to the economy of the area  
 to augment the income from farming and
 will probably continue to grow with   
 the increase in leisure pursuits. The 
 season is, however, short and there is
 some fear that facilities are         
 increasing faster than demand.        </content>
