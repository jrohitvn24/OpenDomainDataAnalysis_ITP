		<title>15  Societies in Lamberhurst</title>
		<content>   For a small village, Lamberhurst has
 a wide variety of{clubs}and{societies.
 The sports clubs have a large{field}  
 behind the{Memorial Hall}in which most
 of the indoor societies meet. Local   
 opinion is divided as to whether the  
 village can afford to demolish and    
 greatly extend the present facilities.
   For{children}there are a playgroup  
 and dancing classes. Brownies, cubs,  
 guides and scouts meet in the school. 
 For the{energetic}there is a keep fit 
 club; matches for cricket and football
 teams; or bowls at a more leisurely   
 pace. The Playing Field Association   
 keeps an eye on all users. Other{     
{interests}catered for are the Parent  
 Teacher and Gardeners Associations;   
 the Local History, Choral and         
 Pantomime Societies; the Royal British
 Legion; the Women's Institute and the 
 Darby and Joan Club.                  </content>
