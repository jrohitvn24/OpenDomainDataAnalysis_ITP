 Samson's Farm is one of the oldest    
 farms in the area, being here since   
 the 11th century. It was refered to in
 the Domesday Book as{Samantuna,}which 
 may mean{Saemann's Tun}(sic), or      
 seaman's holding. This shows just how 
 close to the sea Peldon is. Small     
 creeks still flow up as near to Peldon
 as Brickhouse Farm, on the South of   
 the village.                          
 This area was well known in the 18th  
 century for its smugglers, and Peldon 
 has its own fair share of smuggler's  
 tales.
