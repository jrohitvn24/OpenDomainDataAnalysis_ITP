		<content> Beech is thought of as the traditional
 wood of these Cotswold slopes but     
 there is a long tradition of          
 interplanting conifers. A description 
 of the Dillay Brook Valley in 1900    
 stated that the area was dominated by 
 stately Scots pine-whereas there are  
 now few,if any,to be found.It would   
 seem that the Scots pine was cleared, 
 as many of these woods were,during the
 First and Second World Wars, leaving  
 the beech to dominate.Since the       
 wartime clearances there has been a   
 mixture of natural regeneration and   
 coniferous plantation.Before 1965 and 
 myxomatosis,rabbits were a big problem
 and fenced plantations were generally 
 more successful.                      
 Much of the woodland is managed by    
 forestry groups but Blackstable Wood  
 in the N.E. will shortly be going over
 to National Trust ownership.          </content>
