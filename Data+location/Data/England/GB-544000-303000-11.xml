		<title>11Friday Bridge School</title>
		<content> Friday Bridge had 2 schools but there 
 is now only one. The original National
 School was opened in 1872 &amp; cost of   
 Â£886. Children of all ages attended   
 the school until 1928 when children   
 over ten were transferred to the new  
 school. The children had to use       
 outside toilets that contained        
 buckets. In winter they could not have
 PE because they didn't have a hall to 
 do it in. The children had different  
 holidays to us. They had two weeks off
 for strawberry picking and two weeks  
 off for potato picking. The old school
 closed in 1958. The present school was
 opened in 1928 as a secondary modern  
 school but in 1958 the secondary      
 children were transferred to the      
 Queen's school in Wisbech. The school 
 re-opened in 1973 additions include:  
 hall, classroom, swimming pool. Today 
 the school contains 109 pupils.       </content>
