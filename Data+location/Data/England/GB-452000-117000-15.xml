		<content>   Bishops Waltham once had a fine     
{railway station}connecting us to      
 nearby towns along the Meon Valley.   
 But nowadays it no longer exists and  
 we only have{buses and cars}to go from
 place to place.                       
   Bus services to such places as      
 Fareham and Winchester are{infrequent 
 and{cost a lot}of money. Bishops      
 Waltham has a coach service called    
{Glider Service.                       
   More recently local people raised   
 funds for the{Bishops Waltham Minibus 
 which is needed mainly to transport   
 the{elderly}and is hired by other     
 local groups and clubs for outings    
 etc. Other transport like{motorbikes  
 and{bicycles}are fairly usual but     
 lorries we only see now if passing by 
 or carrying supplies.
