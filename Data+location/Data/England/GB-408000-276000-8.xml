 Shirley area provide a wide range of  
 choice for all ages ,but the most     
 common activity involving children is 
 watching television(80%).Over 75% also
 take part in both listening to records
 and some sporting activity.Other      
 activities include dancing and        
 music,youth clubs and                 
 organisations,computers and church    
 activities.The most common activity of
 adults is sport,followed by drinking  
 and eating out,gardening and watching 
 TV.Within the sample studied,just     
 under half were satisfied with        
 recreational facilities.Of those who  
 were not,most stressed the need for   
 leisure centres,swimming pools and the
 re-opening of the cinema,closed in
