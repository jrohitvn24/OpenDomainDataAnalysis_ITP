		<title>18JAMES BARR GARAGE SANDON</title>
		<content>   The garage does not sell cars       
 now,but it repairs and services       
 Renault cars.Each day they have       
 between three to ten cars to be       
 serviced or repaired.The number is    
 dependent on the time it takes to do  
 the job.There is a large spare part   
 section.They have in stock about 34   
 thousand different parts.Usually each 
 day about a thousand pounds worth of  
 goods are sold, either over the       
 counter or to other garages.Four      
 people work in the spare part section 
 and also there are two car mechanics, 
 a manager and a secretary.All the     
 spares are listed on computer sheets  
 and they know exactly how many parts  
 were sold for any time of the year.The
 computer also suggests which parts    
 should be re-ordered.
