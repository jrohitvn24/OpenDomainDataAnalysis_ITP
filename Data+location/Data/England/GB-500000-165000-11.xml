		<title>11THE VILLAGE OF LYNE</title>
		<content>     Lyne village spreads along Lyne   
 Lane and Almner's Road.  Holy Trinity 
 church and Lyne and Longcross First   
 School are at the southern end of Lyne
 Lane with Lyne Club, the Recreation   
 ground and the Royal Marine public    
 house being situated halfway along the
 lane, just past the T junction with   
 Almners Road.                         
      Almners Road begins opposite Fan 
 Court and meets Hardwick Lane and Lyne
 Crossing Road at Almners Priory.  The 
 village is bounded on two sides by the
 M25 and the M3 motorways, on the third
 side by St. Peters Hospital and on the
 fourth side by the MVEE at Longcross.
