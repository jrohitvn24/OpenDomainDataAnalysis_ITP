tiled roof.I go through the wooden     
front door of my semi-detached house   
and see the hall with the wooden book  
case and telephone.I walk through into 
the kitchen there is a sink, fridge ,  
electric cooker,    freezer,washing    
machine, drawers and cupboards.Through 
the back door there is quite a small   
garden with three hutches for my       
pets.In the dining room there is a     
record player,table,chairs,shelves,    
fire,coffee table, television,video    
and computer.Upstairs the first door   
leads to the bathroom.The second door  
leads to my bedroom,there is a         
wardrobe,dressing table,desk,drawers   
and a bed.The third door leads in to   
another bedroom,where there are two    
wardrobes,a double bed,and a dressing  
table.There is one other small bedroom.
