		<content> In the 1981 census the population of  
 the Parish of Okeford Fitzpaine was   
 634 people.  Approximately 450 people 
 lived in the main part of the village,
 and there were about 145 people aged  
 16 or under,while 19% were of         
 pensionable age.                      
                                       
 Quite a lot of families have lived in 
 the village for generations. Corben,  
 Ridout and Trowbridge are all common  
 local names which occur in the records
 over centuries. However, since about  
 1980, a lot of people have moved into 
 the village from further afield. Many 
 of these have retired to the village. 
                                       
 Apart from the main village the       
 population is sparse, with isolated   
 farms and tiny hamlets.
