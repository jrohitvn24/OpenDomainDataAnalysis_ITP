		<title>04THE RICHMOND LAKE</title>
		<content> Before the lake was here there was    
 only farmland.It was excavated in 1922
 by Redland GravelCompany to make      
 concrete.For 30years it was used for  
 gravel.For 20years after that it was a
 disused gravel pit.The hole filled    
 naturally.In 1980 Mr.Kirk bought it   
 and made it into a windsurfing and    
 fishing centre.                       
  The fishing and windsurfing is       
 becoming popular and there are over   
 200 visitors on a Sunday.Mr.Kirk      
 infilled parts of the lake to make    
 sure it is safe and also to make small
 pools for breeding fish.The lake is   
 open for fishing from 6a.m.to 8p.m.   
  The windsurfing centre provides a    
 sailboard,wet suit and tuition for    
 beginners.Further developments may    
 include water skiing and aqua diving.
