		<title>16MUSEUMS - NAPTON NICKELODEON</title>
		<content> We went to Napton Nickelodeon in the  
 High Street. It is owned by Mr.       
 Whitehead. He shows films and has a   
 collection of musical instruments. He 
 has restored many of the instruments  
 himself and he will play them for     
 groups of people who visit the museum.
 Parts of the collection date from the 
 late 19th and early 20th century and  
 come from all over Europe. The        
 collection includes a hurdy gurdy,    
 barrel organs, a one man band, a photo
 player, early juke boxes and musical  
 dolls. At the top of the museum is a  
 perfectly fitted cinema complete with 
 a pre-war cafe and a Compton Cinema   
 organ from a cinema in Hammersmith.   
 The organ rises from the basement, as 
 it would in its original setting. He  
 holds film shows and shows cartoons,  
 comedy films and Pathe News, including
 the last edition of Pathe News.       </content>
