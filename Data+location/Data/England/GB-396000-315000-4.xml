		<content>    Part of the Country Park lies      
within our survey block.               
    It is an area of heathland where   
hills and valleys are crossed by many  
narrow paths.                          
    Heather, bracken and gorse abound, 
and silver birch, hawthorn and pine    
trees can be seen.                     
    The whole area is excellent for    
walking and for picnics. On Anson's    
Bank special car parking and picnic    
areas have been provided. A local firm 
have paid for a toposcope which is     
engraved onto a sheet of aluminium and 
specially water-proofed, and fixed to  
a boulder. From this vantage point many
distant landmarks can be seen.         
    Wild life abounds: many species of 
birds, fallow deer, and  small mammals 
can be seen. Occasionally snakes,      
including adders, are to be found.
