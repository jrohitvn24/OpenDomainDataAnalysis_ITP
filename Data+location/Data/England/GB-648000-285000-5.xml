		<content> Inside the vestry the robes are kept  
 and there is a safe in which all the  
 registers are kept plus silver and    
 money from collections. There is one  
 bell which due to a weak frame is nly 
 pulled down and not allowed to swing  
 over. It rings 5 minutes before a     
 service is due to begin. Nowadays the 
 church is only full for special       
 services like weddings, funerals and  
 when the Old School attends.During the
 week services are held at Brampton and
 Sotterley churches. From 1986 Henstead
 church and and Hulver Methodist church
 are to share services.
