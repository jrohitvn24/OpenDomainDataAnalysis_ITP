		<content>   The Manhood Community Centre offers 
 a wide scope of courses to the people 
 of Selsey. These evening and weekend  
 courses cover a large number of       
 subjects from Maths and Languages to  
 art, craft and pottery; from car      
 maintenance to gymnastics.            
  There is a thriving Youth Wing where 
 the teenagers of the village can meet,
 listen to music and mix together      
 generally. This is where they can take
 part in the Duke of Edinburgh Scheme  
 where they work for bronze, silver and
 gold awards. The three dramatic       
 groups, Selsey Choral and Musical     
 Productions, who put on the Christmas 
 pantomimes; the Variety Club, who     
 produce "Music Hall" entertainment;   
 and the Operatic Society meet there   
 for rehearsals and productions. The   
 Manhood Showband rehearse in the      
 centre regularly.                     </content>
