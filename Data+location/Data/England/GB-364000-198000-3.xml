		<title>03BERKELEY PILL</title>
		<content> Running through the middle of this    
 area is a stream, known locally as the
{Pill.}Until the late 1960's the Pill  
 was tidal, when a{dam}was built close 
 to where the Pill enters the{River    
{Severn.}Before the dam was built the  
 local farmers  had to build up the    
 banks with earth mounds. There are    
 places though where the banks slope   
 gently down to the water so that      
 cattle can drink from the Pill safely.
 The dam was built with a{non-return   
{valve}so that water could flow from   
 the Pill to the river and not from the
 river up the Pill at high tides, so   
{preventing flooding.                  
 Situated on the Pill is an old{flour  
{mill}which used to be powered by pill 
 water, but now uses electrical power. 
 The Pill which is popular for{fishing 
 passes close to{Berkeley Power Station
 before entering the River Severn.     </content>
