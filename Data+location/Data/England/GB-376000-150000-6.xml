		<content>{Lullington is a small village close to
{the edge of Orchardleigh Park. It has 
{a lovely l3th. cent. church with      
{beautifully carved north doorway with 
{a tympanum showing the tree of life. }
 The original Norman church was built  
 between 1070-ll00. The font is the    
 most decorated one in Somerset.       
{Orchardleigh} has a church on an      
 island in the middle of a lake.  The  
 church consists of a nave and chancel,
 with a rebuilt south porch. Outside,  
 at the edge of the lake is the grave  
 of Sir Henry Newbolt the poet. The    
 church was built in about the middle  
 of the 13th century.The original Manor
 house was pulled down in 1856 and the 
 present house built 1855-58 by Thomas 
 Henry Wyatt. It is picturesque,       
 irregular and in a mixed Elizabethan  
 style.   Ann White  (10)
