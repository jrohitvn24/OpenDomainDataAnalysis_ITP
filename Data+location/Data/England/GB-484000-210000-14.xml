		<title>14Weston Turville's Activities</title>
		<content>     Leisure and recreation is         
plentiful in Weston Turville.We have   
many clubs such as golf,football,and   
rugby;and in the evening we have youth 
club and Brownies,all of which are very
popular.                               
     Many people do arts and crafts in 
the village,and the community often    
gather for fetes and playgroups for    
the younger children.                  
     The villagers enjoy the           
entertainment of the amateur dramatics 
society who give a production about    
every six months.All their shows have a
lot of work put into them as most of   
them are musicals.Both children and    
adults enjoy these events as it is one 
of the most enjoyable activities that  
Weston Turville provides.
