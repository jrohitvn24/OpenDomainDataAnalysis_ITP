		<title>18Rugby League in Wigan</title>
		<content>Rugby League is very popular in our    
area. This year Wigan reached the final
of the Rugby League Challenge Cup and  
thousands of Wigan supporters went down
to Wembley to watch the game.          
I got up at 6 o'clock to go to Wembley.
I was wearing white jeans and a red    
jumper. We were going to watch the     
final of the Challenge Cup between Hull
and Wigan. We caught our coach near the
Gas Showrooms. It took us about six    
hours to get there. At 2.30pm we made  
our way to the stadium. We gave the man
our tickets and went inside to sit     
down. It was a lovely view, all the    
Wigan fans were cheering. It was very  
exciting. Wigan eventually won 28 - 24 
and after the match kWigan's captain   
Graeme West collected the cup.
