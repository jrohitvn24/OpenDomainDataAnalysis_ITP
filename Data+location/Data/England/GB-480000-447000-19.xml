 Officer for the Pocklington area.     
{Q. How does the crime rate compare    
{with other places in the country?}    
 A. Taking into account the density of 
 the population and the type of        
 location it is, it is similar pro rata
 to the rest of the country.           
{Q. What are the main crimes in the    
{area and which age groups are         
{responsible for them?}                
 A. The main crimes are burglary, minor
 theft, and damage. Burglaries are     
 committed mainly by travelling        
 criminals, from the York, west Riding,
 and South Yorkshire areas. Minor theft
 and criminal damage (vandalism), is   
 usually done by local youngsters      
 between the ages of 12 and 20, but    
 particularly those between the ages of
 15 and 18 years.
