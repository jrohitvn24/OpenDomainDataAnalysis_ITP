		<title>11Mr. Lidgett. Part Two.</title>
		<content>                                       
  When Mr. Lidgett was young he enjoyed
 playing games. He was in the village  
 football and cricket teams. In those  
 days they played lots of the games we 
 still play today, for example piggy in
 the middle, conkers, rounders,        
 marbles, and skittles. One of his     
 favourite games was hoop and stick.   
 The hoop was made of iron and the     
 stick was used to spin the hoop.      
  Although Mr. Lidgett has driven      
 tractors and lorries on farms he has  
 never driven a car on the road.       
 Cycling has always been an important  
 form of transport to Mr. Lidgett and  
 even now he is a keen cyclist.
