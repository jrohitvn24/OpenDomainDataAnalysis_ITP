		<content> Sheerlands Farm is the largest in the 
 Pluckley area with 180 acres of land. 
 Most of this is fruit orchards,       
 although hops were grown until 1984.  
 Fruit tree saplings are bought from   
 Holland and Belgium. Six varieties of 
 dessert apples are grown, Jonagold,   
 Coxes, Discovery, Worcester, Tideman  
 Worcester and Eider Red. While only   
 two varieties of cooking apples,      
 Grenedier and Bramley. Conference and 
 Cornice pears are grown.              
   The fruit is picked by hand and     
 apples are stored at 42F. and pears at
 29F. The apples are polished and      
 graded into 7 different sizes. Bruised
 apples go for cider making. A computer
 linked to Canterbury organizes the    
 dispatch of boxes of fruit to their   
 destinations.
