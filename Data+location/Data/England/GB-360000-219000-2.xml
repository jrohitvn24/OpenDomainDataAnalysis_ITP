		<content>   There is no predominant type of     
 farming in this area (neither arable  
 nor livestock).Most of the crops grown
 are cash crops which change year by   
 year.                                 
   There are two large farms in the    
 area and several smaller ones.The     
 larger ones are mainly arable with a  
 few sheep for grazing. There are few  
 herds of cattle though there is a     
 dairy unit in{Hope Mansell.}As well as
 this there is a Turkey unit which is  
 also used to breed pheasants for a    
 shoot in{Warmhill Wood.               
{ }In the past few years there has been
 an increase in potatoe growing        
 especially along the side of{Castle   
{Brook}which is used for irrigation    
 during the summer. As well as this    
 there has been some experimentation   
 with beet and maize (for stock).
