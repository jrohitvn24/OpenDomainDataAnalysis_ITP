		<title>15Dalton in 1925</title>
		<content> Five ladies all over 80 years old     
 described life in 1925.Their education
 was formal,the work concentrated on   
 the 3rs,which were reading,writing and
 arithmetic.There were very few        
 colleges,only rich people went there. 
 Most people left school at 14 because 
 their parents could not afford to let 
 them stay at school any longer. After 
 school children used to play games    
 including whips and tops,marbles,     
 shirley cocks,hop scotch and skipping.
 On leaving school the main job for    
 girls was to work "in service." "In   
 service" was when young women went to 
 work for richer people. The work      
 consisted of black leading the fire,  
 cleaning the fender,washing the       
 clothes using a big tub,a dolly leg   
 and a mangle to squeeze the water out 
 of them and polishing the floors and  
 furniture amongst other jobs.         </content>
