		<title>15Southampton Bird Life</title>
		<content>   In our part of the D-Block we have  
 watched the bird life. We did a survey
 to find the most common birds. They   
 were:- 1{House Sparrow}2{Starling}3   
{Blackbird}4{Mistle Thrush}5{Robin}6   
{Chaffinch}7{Dunnock}8{Carrion Crow}9  
{Song Thrush}10{Black-headed Gull .    
  "I watched some{swifts}flying over { 
{Nursling}village. They were ducking   
 and diving and doing loops. They flew 
 very fast feeding on insects."        
  "At{Test Valley Nature Reserve}I saw 
 a small bird with black on its face, a
 long tail, and light brown wings. It  
 had a pale grey head, a whitish throat
 and a yellow bill. I found out it was 
 a male{Bearded Tit}."                 
  "My favourite bird is the{Kestrel.}I 
 see one hovering over the M271. Its   
 head quite still while its wings flap.
 Its powerful eyes spot something, and 
 it swoops onto the bank for its prey."</content>
