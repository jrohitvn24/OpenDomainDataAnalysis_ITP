		<title>14Folk Customs in Curry Rivel</title>
		<content> Curry Rivel has some folk customs.    
 Some are pretty old, some are not.    
 The Christingle Service is at the     
 church and it is a fairly new custom. 
 It takes place in the month of        
 December, on Christingle Day. You all 
 have to make a 'Christingle'. A       
 Christingle is an orange with a candle
 stuck in the top, then you put a red  
 ribbon around it. Into this ribbon you
 place 4 cocktail sticks and onto these
 put currants, dates and pieces of     
 dried fruit. The orange represents the
 world, the candle represents Christ - 
 the light of the world, the red ribbon
 represents the blood that Jesus shed, 
 and the dried fruit represents the    
 fruit of the earth.                   
 During the Christingle service all the
 chidren who have made a 'Christingle' 
 carry them up the central aisle to the
 main altar with the candles alight.   </content>
