		<title>06A Weekend in my Life</title>
		<content>   One weekend we were asked to write  
 down the main things we did each hour.
 This is my weekend.                   
   On Saturday I slept for 10hrs, but  
 on Sunday I slept for 12hrs. On       
 Saturday I helped my mum, and that    
 took one hour, but on Sunday I didn't 
 because I was ill. On Saturday I had  
 two main meals that lasted 2 hours,   
 but on Sunday I had a snack meal. On  
 Sunday my sister was home so I could  
 play with her. There was no gym on    
 Sunday, but I spent three hours doing 
 gumnastics on the Saturday. Thus on   
 Saturday I slept for 46% of the day,  
 and spent 8.3% of the day eating.     
   I played by myself when my sister   
 was out playing with her friend. The  
 other things I did was to watch       
 television and wash myself.
