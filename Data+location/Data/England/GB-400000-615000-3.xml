 Below Ingram,the area is criss-crossed
 with narrow roads,none of which are   
 graded any better than 'C'class.Below 
 Reaveley Bridge passing is easy       
 between two cars,but,above the bridge 
 one if not both cars would need to    
 pull onto the grass-verge.A good deal 
 of road in the area is unfenced.Above 
 Ingram there is but one narrow road   
 which is for the most part unfenced.In
 addition to these County Council owned
 roads,there are many rough tracks     
 between steadings that are suitable   
 only for tractors or four-wheel drive 
 vehicles.There is one bridge across   
 the Breamish in this grid.This is at  
 Ingram.
