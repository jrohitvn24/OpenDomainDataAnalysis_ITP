		<title>11 Sawmill. Harlestone Heath</title>
		<content> The mill, built by Lord Spencer in the
1900's covers an area of about three   
acres. It provides jobs for fourteen,  
not including the lorry crivers.       
Health and Safety Inspectors check the 
mill about twice a year. There are four
saws including a very big one that cuts
tree trunks into strips. They cut seven
types of softwoods and also buy timber 
from other countries.                  
 The trees are allowed to grow to about
five metres before felling and a gap of
four metres is left between each tree. 
Some trees die off because of disease. 
 The tree trunks are stored in the yard
at the back of the mill. The sawdust is
sold to butchers and the stumps are    
used for firewood. The mill area       
abounds in large African ants first    
introduced on the estate for game      
hunting.
