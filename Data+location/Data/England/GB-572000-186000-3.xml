		<title>03A  Saturday in Pitsea .</title>
		<content> Saturday is the most enjoyable day in 
 the week.I go to Pitsea Market which  
 is open from 9 o'clock in the morning 
 until 4 o'clock in the afternoon.It   
 has many interesting stalls and a few 
 shops.I also normally go to my local  
 sweetshop which is Gowers where I buy 
 lots of sticky sweets.                
   For lunch I go to the  chipshop to  
 buy Fish and Chips which is one of the
 many foods which they sell.After I    
 have eaten, to refresh myself, the    
 local swimming pool is the ideal      
 place.For 10p to get in and 10p for   
 the locker it isn't really an         
 expensive hobby.After all that        
 exercise my house is a great place    
 place to put my feet up and go to     
 sleep.
