 WE interviewed Mr F.Waterman,Chairman 
 of Pimperne Parish Council.He told us 
 in the Parish Council there are seven 
 people who live or have business      
 interests in Pimperne.They have to be 
 over 18 to be elected onto the        
 Council.There is an election every 4  
 years.The Parish Council deals with   
 things like checking the swings and   
 slides for us and they repair all     
 sorts of things.They plant trees.All  
 this cost about Â£3000 this year, and  
 they gave Â£30 for a party under the   
 chestnut tree to celebrate VE Day.    
 The Pimperne Parish Council wants Five
 Ways to be made more safe.            
 Pimperne has changed over the last 20 
 years,lots more houses have been      
 built.The Council do not want any more
 built,the village is big enough.
