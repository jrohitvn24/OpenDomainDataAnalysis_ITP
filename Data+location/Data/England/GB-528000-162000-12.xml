		<title>12Thomas More School</title>
		<content>Our school building is 122 years old.  
The foundation stone was laid by Edward
Prince of Wales in 1863. Originally it 
was an orphanage for 150 children.     
Today it is a catholic school. The 650 
pupils dress in green and grey uni-    
forms. The school is a grade 2 listed  
building and a good example of         
Victorian Gothic architecture. It has a
symmetrical design and a very elaborate
main entrance in the centre of the     
building. Alot of smaller buildings    
have been added. There is now a swim-  
ming pool and a science block. This    
brickwork is patterned in red, white   
and black and the windows have stone   
columns and carved capitals.
