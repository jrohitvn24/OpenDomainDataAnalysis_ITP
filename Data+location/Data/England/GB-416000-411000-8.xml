		<title>08STORTHES HALL HOSPITAL</title>
		<content>   This was a very big hospital for    
 mentally ill people. It used to have  
 3000 patients,but now it only has 860 
 patients but that is still very big.It
 will close in 1993 and all the        
 patients will be sent to live with    
 their own families or in small group  
 homes.Now there are 1100 staff to run 
 the hospital.It stands in 400 acres   
 and the buildings have 5 miles of     
 corridors.They do not know what the   
 buildings could be used for when they 
 are empty.The Deputy Administrator    
 said it could be made into houses or  
 an open prison or something else.We   
 thought it could be useful for a      
 polytechnic to study farming and      
 plants and country wildlife.When we   
 looked round we thought it was like a 
 little village on its own. It seems a 
 very friendly place.
