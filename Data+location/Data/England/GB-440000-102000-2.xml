		<content> Hardly comprehensive school is the    
 only secondary school in this         
 particular block. The headmaster is   
 Mr. Underwood and the school is       
 situated on Long Lane, Holbury. It was
 opened in 1935, so this is its 50th   
 anniversary, and it has grown in size 
 to meet the demands of the area as it 
 has expanded. It takes in children    
 between the age of 12 and 16. The     
 school has between 700 and 800 in a   
 year. Mr. Underwood calculates that in
 1991 there will be a minimum number of
 students due to trends in the birth   
 rate and this will be in the region of
 740. The backgrounds of the pupils    
 fall into two different categorties   
 one, families who have lived in the   
 area for generations or two, the      
 families who travel.
