		<title>06 SUPERNATURAL HAPPENINGS</title>
		<content>   "In 1973 my family moved into Dean's
 Farm House, Gedney Drove End. It was  
 originally owned by a man who rented  
 it out to a farmer. This man decided  
 that he wanted someone to purchase the
 house. The farmer refused to purchase 
 it and so it was sold by auction to a 
 couple who only lived in it for a few 
 months, then we moved in. The house   
 was in need of great repair for it had
 been untouched for years. When a damp 
 course was put in, an old fireplace   
 was uncovered which contained a leg of
 a stool and some clay pipes. When the 
 fireplace was uncovered the ghost of  
 an old lady was seen by us in front of
 the fireplace at regular intervals.   
 But the old lady did not seem         
 frightening, but very peaceful and    
 quiet.                                
                                       
                                       </content>
