 There a four pubs in the two villages 
 the Efel inn and the barley mow which 
 are in Trefonen,and the Royal Oak and 
 the Gibrattar which are in Treflach.  
 The Efel Inn is a border and so is the
 Royal Oak.But the Barley Mow is a free
 house.The Gibrattar Inn brews its own 
 beer.The Oak and the Efel are the most
 popular.Not long ago the Barley Mow   
 had a new pool table.The Oak is the   
 only one which is on the main road.   
 the Barley Mow has got a domino team  
 and the Oak has got a darts team and  
 it also serves meals,probably thats   
 why lots of people go there.
