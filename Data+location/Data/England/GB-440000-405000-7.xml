		<content> Our{Gym Club}starts at 6.30pm and     
 finishes at 7.30pm. We meet at{Great  
{Houghton J.&amp; I.School.}The teacher is 
 called Miss Chamberlain. The cost is  
 Â£2.50 for a full term. There are about
 20 people who go. When you first join 
 you are given a card with various     
 tasks written on it. Miss Chamberlain 
 asks you your name then she will give 
 you your card and it will say on it   
{"Coca Cola 4".}Before you pass this   
 card you have to be able to do a      
 handstand and a leapfrog over a       
 partner.From "Coca Cola 4" you can    
 progress to{number 3.}For that you do 
 a cartwheel and a backward roll to    
 astride .Then you move to{"Coca Cola  
{2",}which is a high forward roll and a
 headspring.This is very difficult to  
 do.When you reach{"Coca Cola 1"}you do
 an Arabspring, the splits position and
 a cartwheel with one hand.            </content>
