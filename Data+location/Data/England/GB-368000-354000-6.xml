		<content>     I interviewed Mrs Woodward who    
 lives in Crewe. She has lived here for
 eighty-two years.                     
     Crewe used to be a quiet place    
 with little traffic. Fields were      
 plentiful; a small railway town was   
 all it was. Now it's expanded         
 incredibly into a busy little town    
 where bustle is never-ending.         
    It was bombed in the war,          
 especially Rolls Royce. Some people   
 were killed. Many modern appliances,  
 electrical ones mainly, weren't around
 then.                                 
    The first job she had was in       
 Doodies in Mill Street. She made      
 picture frames. Her first wage was    
 thirteen shillings and nine pence.    
 Night-time amusement was popular and  
 plentiful.                            
                                       
                                       </content>
