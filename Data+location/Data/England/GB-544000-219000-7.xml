		<title>07 THORLEY RESIDENTS' VIEWS</title>
		<content>                                       
Shoppers at the Sainsbury centre in    
the new western suburb of Stortford    
were asked about their origins &amp;       
views on the district.All had migrated 
to Thorley whithin the last 5          
years,some from London,others from     
places as distant as Sheffield &amp;       
Dublin.Their husbands are all          
London commuters.All   purchase        
groceries at the local                 
hypermarket,reached on foot or by      
car.For higher order goods             
ie.furniture they travel to Harlow     
or Cambridge.They like the modern      
housing &amp; think the area is  safe.Most 
intend to stay indefinitely in spite   
of the lack of amenities &amp;             
recreational facilities.The nearest    
theatre,cinima &amp; bingo halls are at    
Harlow.There is no post office,bank,   
school,church or hall on the estate.   </content>
