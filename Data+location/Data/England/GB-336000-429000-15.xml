		<content>     The main industry in the village  
is the firm of J.Wareing and Son       
which is an agricultural and industrial
building contractor.   This firm       
employs 60 workers many living in the  
village.   The firm's main aim is "to  
serve the farmer with a specialised    
service in the fabrication and erection
of farm buildings".                    
                                       
     Wareings believe that they were   
the pioneers of kit buildings          
delivered in kit form complete with    
instructions. These kits have been     
supplied to all areas of Great         
Britain, to the Isle of Man, the Isle  
of Wight and even 2 kits were sent to  
the Falkland Islands. The Sudan has    
also received 10 buildings and         
trailers in connection with a scheme   
to help underpriviledged countries.
