 but was afraid so retreated.That night
 a man was walking home and it is      
 believed that he saw them.The hounds  
 flew through the air ,  so  are also  
{known as  "the flying  hounds."They   
 apparently flew overhead like geese   
 only twice the size,and yelped and    
 called as they swept on southwards.One
 legend  tells us about{"Dead Woman's  
{Thorn."It is  said a lady hung herself
 on a Thorn tree and has haunted the   
 neighbourhood since. The hut is called
  "Dead Woman's Thorn" and  is         
 haunted and has a red cross on the    
 door.It is old and dates from the time
 of the Black Death .Nobody goes there 
 anymore because of the legend .In the 
 time 1847 -1893 a fair was held on    
 Midsummer's day . On Midsummer's eve  
{Fairies dance on the hill
