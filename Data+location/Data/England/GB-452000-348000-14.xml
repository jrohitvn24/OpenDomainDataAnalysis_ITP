		<content> After the very early start and a day  
 at work I am ready for finishing at   
 13.30. When I get home I find that I  
 have to replace a broken window,      
 victim of the cricket ball. Two hours 
 later, I go to see my  Dad. Shortly   
 after, the children arrive home from  
 school. I sort out any problems they  
 have. 5pm and it's time to get washed 
 up ready for dinner - a meal I am     
 really looking forward to. I read the 
 Nottingham Evening Post, nothing on   
 television - again! I do some paper   
 work on my hobby which is Railways    
 which fills much of my leisure time.  
 9pm and it's time to retire to bed,   
 shaving before I go in order to save  
 time the following morning. I read for
 half an hour,then it's lights out     
 until the 4.30am call and then it's   
 time to start all over again.
