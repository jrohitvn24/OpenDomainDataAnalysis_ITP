		<title>03Landscape of Beacon Hill</title>
		<content>Beacon Hill lies to the south of       
Wolverhampton.  It is nearly 230 metres
high and has very steep slopes.  It is 
the highest piece of land near to      
Wolverhampton.                         
It gets its name from when a bonfire   
was lit on top of it to warn people    
that something had happened.  The last 
 time one was lit was for the Queeens  
Silver Jubilee.                        
The towns radio station has been named 
after the hill.  It is called Beacon   
Radio. Also, there is an institute for 
the blind on the lower slopes called   
Beacon House.  The hill is used to     
supply the town with water.  Hidden in 
the top of the hill is a reservoir.    
Water is pumped into the reservoir then
flows through pipes under the influence
of gravity to all the homes in the     
town.
