		<content> THE CLOCK TOWER. Following a{night    
{raid}on{Coventry}by{German planes}a   
{Heinkel bomber jettisoned a land mine 
 over{Kenilworth}on its way back to    
 Germany.{Falling on}the area known as 
{"The Square"}it destroyed several fine
 old buildings and{knocked off the     
{"crown"}or top of the{Clock Tower,}a  
 well-loved feature of the town which  
 was erected in memory of an old       
 Kenilworth family. The{Town Council   
 had a copy of the original{"crown"    
 made to{replace}the one destroyed in  
 1940. The work of{re-construction}was 
 completed in{1963}and the{Clock Tower 
 was finally{restored}to its former    
 glory in the same year. The{new top}is
 easily{distinguishable}as its stone   
 has a much newer,{cleaner}aspect than 
 the{rest of the Tower}and{promotes    
 many a{question}from{inquisitive      
{visitors}to the town.                 </content>
