		<title>17Tomatoes and Cucumbers</title>
		<content>   Tomatoes are planted in the glass   
 houses between December and           
 March. They have to watered carefully,
 the amount given depending on the     
 radiation figure. The side shoots are 
 removed to help strenghten the main   
 plant. When the tomatoes are picked   
 they are graded, 1st class round and  
 firm, 2nd class slightly blemished and
 mis-shapen, 3rd class heavily         
 blemished and cracked. The first of   
 the tomatoes are picked in March. The 
 1st class are packed into boxes and,  
 after inspection, are put into        
 refrigerated lorries and shipped to   
 Portsmouth. The cultivation of        
 cucumbers follows the same timing and 
 procedure as for tomatoes, except that
 there are only two grades. 1st class  
 no blemish and slightly curved, 2nd   
 slightly blemished and curved.
