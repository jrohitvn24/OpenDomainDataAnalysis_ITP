		<title>19FRUIT FARMING</title>
		<content> These trees are not planted for their 
 fruit but for their pollen.Bees are   
 also kept in the orchards to help with
 the pollination. Most of the trees at 
 Mockbeggar are very short and can be  
 picked without the use of ladders.    
 Some of the plum frees,however,are not
 and special ladders have to be used   
 when picking the fruit.The farm uses  
 a lot of water for irrigation and     
 because of this has its own resevoir  
 holding 25 million gallons of water.  
 A great amount of straw is also used  
 at Mockbeggar. Straw is put around the
 bases of the trees to stop weeds,     
 protect the roots from rabbits ,add   
 goodness to the soil and protect the  
 trees from frost.A lot of lime is also
 used because the soil is too acidic.  
 Grass has been planted between the    
 rows of trees on the sloping parts of 
 the farm to prevent soil erosion.     </content>
