		<title>17FLEET'S CHURCHES</title>
		<content> Fleet has several types of Christian  
 Churches, but none for non-Christians.
                                       
{ALL SAINTS Church of England}has just 
 had a new organ. At the Church there  
 is a creche and a Sunday school for   
 the 5 year olds upwards. In Sunday    
 School we learn about God. In Church  
 there is a decorated altar, stained   
 glass windows with pictures of Saints,
 and embroidered hassocks to kneel on. 
                                       
{OUR LADY Roman Catholic Church}is     
 decorated with Stations of the Cross  
 around the sides. The altar has a     
 cloth over it and two large candles.  
 There is sometimes a choir singing.   
                                       
{THE METHODIST Church}has a carved font
 where babies are baptized. At the     
 front there is a plain cross and there
 are coloured windows all around.      </content>
