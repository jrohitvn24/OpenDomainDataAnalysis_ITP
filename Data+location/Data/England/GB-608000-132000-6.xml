		<title>06The Ghost of Port Lympne</title>
		<content>    Port Lympne has a Gift Shop in the 
 Octagonal Library where visitors may  
 buy souvenirs. The custodian talked to
 me in this room  which she said was   
 positioned directly above the site of 
 the Temple of Mithras that the Romans 
 abandoned after the Roman occupation, 
 and told me about the ghost.          
    Whilst making the foundations for a
 new road on the Wild Life Park,       
 workmen found the skeleton of a Roman 
 soldier, still wearing remnants of    
 leather and bronze, only a stones     
 throw from the site of the Temple.    
    Sometimes books are swept from the 
 shelves, flower pots disturbed and    
 flowers, arranged and left in a vase  
 overnight have been removed and laid  
 out in a fan-shaped pattern on the    
 floor.                                
    The ghost is regarded with         
 affection by some, but not by all.    </content>
