		<content>{Langold }used to be called {Langholt} 
 which meant {Long wood.}Langholt was  
 bought by the Royalist Sir Ralph      
 Knight in {1662}and he also bought{   
{Letwell.}His descendants still own    
 land in Langold.Most of Langold       
 consists of council houses. They are  
 semi-detatched or terraced in rows of 
 four. Langold is quite quiet. The A60 
 runs through the middle. There are two
 churches and seven food shops and     
 seven other shops that don't sell     
 food.There is a lake and a swimming   
 pool in a country park.There are two  
 pubs. There used to be a mine but it  
 has been closed. That is why there are
 so many council houses.There used to  
 be a{railway}as well to transport the 
 coal.But today there is no industry in
 Langold so people have to go to other 
 places to work.
