		<title>19BUILDING DEVELOPMENTS</title>
		<content>   Not many new houses are built today 
 as our area is already quite built up,
 and the majority of the buildings date
 from the 1920's. About 13% of the land
 in our Domesday block is covered by   
 major transport routes (M1,railway    
 lines and major roads). A further 32% 
 is occupied by parks and playing      
 fields . The remaining land-cover is  
 chiefly residential and commercial,   
 with a small amount of industry.      
   Much of the new building is carried 
 out to improve and modernise the older
 houses.However, Moorlands Ave. is an  
 example of new development. This was  
 once a piece of unused allotment      
 ground. In 1978 the Council reviewed  
 this, and by 1980 there was a scheme  
 for 20 new houses. These have four    
 rooms upstairs and four downstairs.   
 Two new industrial estates have also  
 just been built in the Mill Hill area.</content>
