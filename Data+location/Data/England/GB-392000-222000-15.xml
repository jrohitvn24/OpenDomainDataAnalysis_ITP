		<title>15CHELTENHAM'S COAT OF ARMS</title>
		<content>{LOCAL HISTORY.}Cheltenham is situated 
 at the foot of the Cotswold Hills in  
 the valley of the River Severn. It is 
 in the county of Gloucestershire and  
 is mentioned in the original Domesday 
 Book. On the town's Coat of Arms an   
 oak tree represents the many{trees}to 
 be found in our streets and parks. The
 pigeons on the Coat of Arms remind us 
 of how Spa Waters  were discovered    
 more than 250 years ago. (A Mr Mason  
 saw{pigeons}drinking from a spring in 
 his field. The spring was mineral     
 water which people thought was good   
 for them. In 1738 his son-in-law Capt 
 Henry Skillicorne dug a well and      
 roofed it. He built a ballroom and    
 billiard room to encourage visitors.  
{ Books}on the Coat of Arms stand for  
 the many good schools and colleges in 
 Cheltenham. Our motto "Salubritas et  
 Eruditio" means Health and Learning.  </content>
