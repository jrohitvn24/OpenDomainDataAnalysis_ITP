		<title>03Badsell Farm Trail Matfield.</title>
		<content>   Opening May to December during      
 daylight hours the{farm trail}round   
 the fields,orchards and woodland by   
 signposted route is also mapped out in
 an{informative leaflet.}Visitors are  
 encouraged to observe the abundant    
 wildlife on the farm. An{information  
{room}containing a display of moths and
 butterflies forms the entrance to the 
 pet area. Here we picked up an animal 
 farm{quiz}which helped us study the   
 rare domestic farm animals,including  
 ducks,bantams and rabbits,and further 
 on goats,pigs,cows and sheep. They all
 seemed very tame,even friendly and all
 had names on their pens.The breeds are
 no longer commercially farmed and the 
 owners aim to{conserve}them as part of
 our{heritage.}With a{shop,picnic area}
 and{sandwich bar}accommodated in some 
 of the lovely farm buildings it all   
 goes to make a very enjoyable visit.  </content>
