 person who was seen and caught is 'on 
 it'.If nobody has been seen you have  
 to get home which is where the person 
 who is 'on it' stands.                
                                       
{Slam}                                 
 To play slam you need a football and  
 four or five players.You kick the     
 football against a wall taking it in  
 turns to do so.You can only kick it   
 once when it is your turn.If you miss 
 the wall you are out and when         
 everybody is out (except one) that    
 person is the winner.                 
                                       
{Sevenses                              
 This is an elimination game,where you 
 throw a ball against a wall,seven     
 times.Then you have to perform other  
 bouncing and catching tasks until you 
 are down to one.A dropped ball is out.</content>
