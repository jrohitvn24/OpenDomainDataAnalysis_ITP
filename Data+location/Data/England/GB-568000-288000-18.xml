		<title>18AT SCHOOL IN FELTWELL</title>
		<content>   At Feltwell School we learn         
 Arithmetic, English, Geography,       
 History, Science, Art, sometimes      
 Drama, also P.E. and games, including 
 netball, football, rounders and       
 cricket. In Arithmetic we do number,  
 fractions, decimals, measuring and    
 tables. In English we do compositions,
 exercises and handwriting. Our school 
 has a good reputation and most people 
 like it but some do not. We have a    
 canteen and you can buy school dinners
 for 60p, also lollies and ice cream.  
   J3 children record the weather which
 includes barometer, weathercock,      
 raingauge, temperature, humidity and  
 cloud. We write it on a special board 
 and put it in a book.                 
   In our school most children get on  
 well with each other. Feltwell School 
 does not have hooligans like some do.
