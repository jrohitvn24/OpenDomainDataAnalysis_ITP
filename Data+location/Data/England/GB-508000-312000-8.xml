		<content> She explained that the{village}of     
 Baston has changed little over the    
 eighteen years which she and her      
 husband have spent here. She finds the
 old part of the village a pleasant and
 close community although the new      
 estate has a more shifting{population.
 The most significant change has been  
 the advent of the{private school,}    
 bringing both advantages such as a    
 constant use of the village church and
 disadvantages such as the increase in 
 the villages traffic. Most village    
 socializing is done through the       
 church,W.I. but particularly the local
 pub. She is kept busy during the day  
 with household chores and as acting   
 secretary to her husband. She enjoys  
 the peaceful rural life but feels it  
 has become essential to be a car      
 owner.She has sealed a{'time capsule'}
 into the wall of her house.           </content>
