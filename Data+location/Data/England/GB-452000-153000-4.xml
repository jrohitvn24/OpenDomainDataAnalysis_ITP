		<content> We have two churches, the All Saints  
 C of E(mentioned in the Domesday Book)
 attended by the majority. The Rector  
 is John Franks who lives in the next  
 village of Wolverton &amp; who officiates 
 in that Parish and two others. Because
 of this, laymen take Sunday services  
 when the Rector is preaching the      
 sermon in the next Parish. Bellringers
 summon the inhabitants to services.   
 There is a small adjacent graveyard.  
 The Methodist congregation is small in
 number but regular attenders &amp; include
 members of  the Silver Band.   This   
 church was built in 1871.  The Roman  
 Catholic services are held in Kings - 
 clere, so members of this faith have  
 to travel 4 miles to worship.         
 There is no animosity between the     
 churches.                             
                                       
                                       </content>
