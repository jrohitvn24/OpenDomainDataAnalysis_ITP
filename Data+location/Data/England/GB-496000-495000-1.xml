		<title>01Area East of Harwood Dale</title>
		<content> The block is predominantly large      
 coniferous plantations and arable     
 farmland with some deciduous woodland,
 mainly along streams.   The A171      
 passes through the block, and a few   
 country roads.   Apart from the small 
 village of Harwood Dale in the west   
 the block has just a scattering of    
 farms and houses.   Is in National    
 Park with pleasant rolling hills so   
 appeals to tourists who drive through,
 visit the village with its picturesque
 church, or walk in the countryside.   
 The north east is more hilly with     
 Haybarn Beck and deciduous woods and  
 seems to attract more visitors than   
 the flatter more open south &amp; west    
 areas, which are overlooked by large  
 flat topped forested hills to the     
 west.  Residents who live outside     
 Harwood Dale nearly all appear to be  
 involved in farming, and forestry.    </content>
