		<title>02Leechmere Industrial Estate</title>
		<content>    There were five in our group. It   
 was a very hot sunny day, just the day
 to do it. We were sweltering. We went 
 to the{Leechmere Industrial Estate}   
 and when we got there we asked people 
 about the{factories.}We wrote the     
 names of the factories down and what  
 they made.                            
    At the car clinic we saw the men   
 spraying the cars and they were       
 putting new bodies on some of them.   
 There were some cars that had very big
 dents on the side. At the Abbey T.V.  
 we thought they did only repairs but  
 they sell them as well and Anthony got
 his telly there.                      
    There was a man making one-armed   
 bandits and at Hawkins we saw sacks   
 of peeled potatoes ready to go to the 
 chip shops.                           
    We were surprised at the great     
 variety of factories on the estate.   </content>
