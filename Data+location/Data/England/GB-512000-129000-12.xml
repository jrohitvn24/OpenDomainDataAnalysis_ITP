		<content>   The main land use around Toat Farm  
 and Bashurst Copse is farming,        
 especially{rough grazing.}There are   
 also a great many{deciduous trees}and 
 few coniferous trees.                 
   At Bashurst Copse, the houses are   
 all made of{local stone}from a quarry 
 near to Christ's Hospital, Horsham.   
 The roofs are either thatched or made 
 of{Horsham slate.}                    
   Toat Farm is no longer a farmhouse, 
 the land having been sold or rented   
 out.There are only a few sheep at Toat
 Farm,and no cattle.The house is Mock _
 Tudor, the roof being made of Horsham 
 slate.                                
   Lower Toat Farm is a{pork and beef  
 farm.                                 
   There is a petrol-pump station at   
 Bashurst Copse,but no other amenities.
 The main crop around this area is     
{rape,}which is used for oil.          </content>
