		<title>03A TYPICAL WEEKEND</title>
		<content>    Usually spent at home or in the    
 locality.Saturday often begins slowly 
 with a walk over the fields to the    
 post office at Freshford to get the   
 weekend bread.This is something I very
 much like to do,no matter what the    
 weather is like,after working indoors 
 all week.This time of the year the    
 garden takes a lot of time but it's   
 nice to see things you have planted   
 growing successfully_well mostly!House
 decoration takes time also and there  
 is certainly enough this year to be   
 done,but I certainly prefer           
 gardening.Walking on a weekend        
 afternoon with the family and         
 friends is one of the best ways of    
 taking advantage of living in this    
 area, and having friends to visit for 
 the weekend is one of the best ways of
 sharing it with them.
