		<title>12Birdwatching in Exford</title>
		<content> All my family like birdwatching. For  
 Domesday we thought that we would do a
 village birdwatch and describe some of
 the birds seen in an hour.  First we  
 walked by the river in Exford .We saw 
 a grey wagtail catching flies. Then a 
 blue tit in the trees.Some Mallards   
 swimming in the river disturbed a     
 dipper. Every time that we looked up  
 we saw swallow,housemartin and swifts.
 In the Auction field  we saw magpie,  
 blackbird,crow,rook and jackdaw. A    
 starling was  feeding among the cows. 
 On the Green there were pied wagtail, 
 chaffinch,housesparrow and a herring  
 gull.In the hedges flocks of goldfinch
 greenfinch were found.On the way home 
 we saw the king of Exmoor birds the   
 Buzzard. These are just a few of the  
 birds found on Exmoor.
