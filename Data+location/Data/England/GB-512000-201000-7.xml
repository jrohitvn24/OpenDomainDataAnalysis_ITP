		<content>Once the area was covered in woodland, 
as you can guess from the names of the 
two villages,Bricket Wood and How      
Wood, and all of the streets and open  
spaces have plenty of trees, some of   
them very large.                       
                                       
The only industrial buildings,         
are those at Colney Street, on the     
industrial estate.                     
The houses are surrounded by fields and
woods;there are ups and downs,but no   
really big hills.                      
Two rivers,the Ver and the             
Colne,meander through the area, and    
then join together.                    
The landscape is being changed,at the  
moment,by the building of the last     
stretch of the M 25 motorway,to be     
built.
