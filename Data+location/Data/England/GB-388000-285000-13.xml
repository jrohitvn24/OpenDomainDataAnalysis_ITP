		<title>13DELPH LOCKS, BRIERLEY HILL</title>
		<content>    The{Delph Locks}rise from The Black
 Delph Bridge on the{Stourbridge Canal 
 to join the{Dudley Canal}at The Nine }
 Locks Bridge. The flight of seven     
 (originally nine)form an important    
 local landmark, which rise 26.4m in   
 approximately 500m.This gradient being
 almost 'alpine' by canal standards.   
    The locks and canal were opened in 
 conjunction with the expansion of     
 heavy industry in the area at the end 
 of the 18th century, the capital for  
 the venture being raised by a group of
 local businessmen including the{Stuart
 family and other glass and steel      
 producers.                            
    Between 1945-70 the canal fell into
 disrepair, gradually silting up and   
 becoming overgrown.It has been greatly
 restored, but is now used purely for  
 leisure.The main value of the locks to
 local residents is as an open space.  </content>
