		<title>07THE LOCAL POPULATION</title>
		<content> The number of people living in the    
 survey area is approximately 250.There
 are three minor concentrations.One is 
 at Bridge End on the eastern edge of  
 the village of Great Bardfield.The    
 others are at Hawkins Hill,Little     
 Sampford and Hawkspur Green, a hamlet 
 of Little Bardfield.The remainder are 
 scattered throughout the area, living 
 in isolated farmhouses or cottages.   
 Many of the people are local farming  
 families or people born in the area   
 who work in neighbouring towns or     
 villages.Others are retired people who
 wished to settle in the countryside or
 commuters who are prepared to accept  
 the travel commitment to London,      
 Cambridge or Chelmsford as the price  
 for living in the heart of the Essex  
 countryside.Examples of the kind of   
 work these people do are teaching,    
 legal, carpentry and secretarial.     </content>
