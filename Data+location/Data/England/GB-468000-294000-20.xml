   Shangton is a very small village    
 consisting of a few scattered houses. 
 The church lies outside the village   
 overlooking the site of the original  
 abandoned village.                    
    St. Nicholas's church was built    
 mainly in the fourteenth century      
 although the porch is said to be much 
 older.                                
    There is a story that a candle was 
 lit in the tiny windows at the west   
 end of the church to guide the        
 villagers the half mile or so to the  
 church on winter evenings. It is also 
 said that the village was deserted due
 to the plague.
