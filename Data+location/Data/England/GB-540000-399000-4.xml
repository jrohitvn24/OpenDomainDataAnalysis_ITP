		<content>  A LARGE AREA OF THE BEACH IN THE     
 BLOCK IS TAKEN UP BY AN RAF BOMBING   
 AND STRAFFING RANGE. IT IS USED FOUR  
 DAYS A WEEK BY THE RAF AND THE USAF.  
 AIRCRAFT COME FROM MAINLAND EUROPE AS 
 WELL AS FROM STATIONS IN BRITAIN.THERE
 ARE STRAFFING TARGETS WHICH ARE NO    
 MORE THAN SACKING SHEETS ON METAL     
 FRAMES. THERE ARE TWO BOMBING TARGETS:
 ONE IS AT THE CENTRE OF A 50M CIRCLE  
 OF RED AND WHITE PAINTED OIL DRUMS.   
 THE OTHER IS A FLOATING TARGET. THE   
 RANGE IS CONTROLLED FROM A TOWER      
 MANNED BY RAF PERSONEL AT DONNA NOOK  
 ITSELF (SITE OF AN OLD LIFEBOAT       
 STATION AND PROBABLY NAMED AFTER A    
 SUNKEN SPANISH GALLEON).THERE ARE     
 THREE 'QUADS' ALSO. THESE ARE HUTS IN 
 WIRE NETTING ENCLOSURES FROM WHICH THE
 BOMB DETONATIONS CAN BE ACCURATELY    
 FIXED BY TRIANGULATION.ON THURSDAYS   
 THE RANGE IS USED TO TEST FIELD GUNS. </content>
