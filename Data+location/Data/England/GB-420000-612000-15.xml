		<title>15RATHEUGH FOLLY</title>
		<content> On {Ratheugh Crag}stands the{Folly}   
 which the {1st Duke of Northumberland}
 had built as an {observatory.}It was  
 designed by {Robert Adam}and probably 
 built by {John Bell}who built{        
{Pottergate Tower}and{St.Michael's Pant
 in{Alnwick}at about the same time.The 
 obsevatory was built so that the Duke 
 could take guests out riding to view  
 his lands which had been newly        
 landscaped as far as{Brizlee Tower}by{
{Capability Brown.}The Folly was built 
 to look like a ruined castle and the  
 Duke's room at the top is reached by a
 narrow spiral staircase.Nowadays it is
 only used about twice a year for the  
{Point to Point Meeting.}Rooks or crows
 build huge nests on the staircase.For 
 about 5years Taffy Carter lived there 
 but as there was only a well for water
 and no electricity ,he had to leave   
 when his wife became ill.             </content>
