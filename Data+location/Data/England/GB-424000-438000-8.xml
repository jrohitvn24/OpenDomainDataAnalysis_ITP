		<title>08Summary of Industrial Estate</title>
		<content> As can be seen from the employment    
 figures there is an even spread of    
 manpower throughout the five main     
 groups and the industrial estate      
 itself provides work for 1258         
 people.The estate has both local and  
 national importance in terms of jobs  
 and in the fact that there are several
 unique companies providing a service  
 on a country wide basis.              
      In the total there are 34        
 companies working on the estate and   
 there are several new buildings still 
 vacant and consequently room for more 
 expansion.The estates  position on the
 Leeds Ring Road and its proximity to  
 the city itself are very attractive   
 to potential developers.Indeed it     
 appears that over the years the estate
 has changed considerably and many of  
 the original companies are no longer  
 on site.                              </content>
