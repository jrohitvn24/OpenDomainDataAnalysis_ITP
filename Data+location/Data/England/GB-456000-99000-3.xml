		<content>    At{8.45}I enter school.I am among  
 the first people to arrive.I sit down 
 at my place and change my shoes.From  
 my drawer I get out the books I will  
 need.At{8.55}everyone is here,Mrs.    
 Fane calls the register and does the  
 dinner numbers,whilst we read our     
 books.Later some groups do{Maths}while
 others do{Language}work.After assembly
 the groups swap over until lunch-time.
    Our hall is not big enough to seat 
 all the children for lunch at the same
 time.Years 1 and 4 and 3 and 2        
 alternate to be 1st. and 2nd.sittings.
 We have two head-servers to each      
 table.Head-servers keep the children  
 on their table quiet.After lunch we do
{Art,Games,History,Science,Geography   
 and{Nature}depending on the day.      
    We have three playtimes during the 
 day.The one in the morning is from    
 10.20 to 10.40.                       </content>
