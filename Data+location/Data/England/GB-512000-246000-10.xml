		<content> Freezers, food processors, dishwashers
 &amp; microwave ovens are becoming widely 
 owned in the area, with refrigerators,
 washing machines &amp; vacuum cleaners the
 norm. Modern{domestic appliances}have 
 removed the need for a mammoth annual 
 Spring clean, a vital factor in homes 
 where both partners work, although    
 some{domestic help}may be employed.The
 population in the area is generally   
 affluent, with few cases of hardship  
 compared with other parts of Britain. 
 Much{home hospitality}is extended.    
 Many enjoy theatre or concert trips,  
 two cars, private education, and      
 holidays abroad and at home. Worthy   
 charities and local ventures are given
 support and{companionship}found at the
 Tea Room, 'The Crown' public house and
 the Ickwell Cricket Club. The majority
 find the area friendly, and appreciate
 the{community spirit}which exists.    </content>
