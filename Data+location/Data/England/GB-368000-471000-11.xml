		<title>11Shopping in Ingleton.</title>
		<content> There is a sports shop in Ingleton it 
 is a good shop they sell mostly       
 climbing equipment and skiing         
 equipment.There is one electric shop  
 in Ingleton where they sell washers,  
 microwaves and televisions.If your    
 television breaks down you just take  
 it to the shop and they will fix it.  
 The shop is owned by Mr Tooby.There   
 is one clotheswear shop which is      
 owned by Joan Murray.She sells        
 trousers,sweaters,shoes and trainers  
 and a lot of other things.We are lucky
 because we have a lot of shops for a  
 small village.Many shops cater for the
 tourists and sell such things as      
 postcards, souvenirs and maps of the  
 area.These shops are often open at    
 weekends and are usually very busy.
