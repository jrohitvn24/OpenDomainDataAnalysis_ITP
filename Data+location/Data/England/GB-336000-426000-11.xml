		<content>   The farming in the study area is    
 highly mechanised.Most of the farms   
 have a small percentage of their land 
 set by to grow root crops to feed     
 their animals.The main problem with   
 farming on the Fylde Coast is caused  
 by the low_lying land that is often   
 flooded,and therefore marshy,so large 
 amounts of money,some from the {      
{E.E.C.,}has to be spent draining the  
 land artificially.                    
   Lodge Farm consists of 80 acres,the 
 land is mainly marsh and can be used  
 for grazing cows.They grow wheat,     
 barley and grass for silage.They breed
 pigs and have a few hens.             
   The farm is run by the family,and   
 they employ 1 man full_time,during the
 summer and autumn.They also employ    
 casual labour.
