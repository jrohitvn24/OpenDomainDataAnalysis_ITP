		<title>14SYTCHAMPTON SCHOOL.</title>
		<content> Sytchampton school was built in 1729  
 it is a charity school. It was started
 up by{RICHARD LLOYD}a land owner. He  
 charged 1p a week for his workers'    
 children to attend this school. The   
 school was rebuilt in 1926. This      
 building is listed. The village was   
 split up by duel carriageway &lt;A449>   
 and so now there is a scattered       
 community. The children come from a   
 large area. They all come by car even 
 the children who live very near as the
 &lt;A449> is such a busy road to cross by
 foot. There are 46 children at present
 attending{Sytchampton School}but the  
 school will take up to 50 children. If
 the numbers drop below 25 the school  
 would probably close. There are two   
 teachers at present, one of which is  
 the headmistress. There is a secretary
 but only part time. The school has a  
 video, computer, TV etc.              </content>
