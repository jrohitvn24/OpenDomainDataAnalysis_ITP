    Hythe has preserved most of its    
 buildings. In 1580 there was an       
 earthquake which made the bells in{St 
{Leonards Church Tower}ring. In 1739 on
 April the 24th there was another      
 earthquake which made the church tower
 fall from its position at 11 o'clock  
 in the morning. There were ten people 
 who nearly got killed but luckily they
 survived.                             
                                       
                                       
    Hythe's most famous and most       
 treasured possession is the chart     
 which{Edward the 1st}made in 1278 when
 confirming privileges given to the    
 ports.
