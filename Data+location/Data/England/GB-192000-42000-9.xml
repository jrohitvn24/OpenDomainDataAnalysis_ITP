		<content>  38 YEARS OLD FREDDY MARTIN LEFT      
 SCHOOL AGED 15. THERE HAVE BEEN       
 SEVERAL ALTERATIONS                   
TO THE USE OF BUILDINGS IN TREGONY DUE 
TO THE TOURIST INDUSTRY.(EG THE        
CARAVAN). ALSO THE VILLAGE HAS         
INCREASED IN SIZE. THE PRICE OF SOME   
HOUSES HAS INCREASED TEN TIMES SINCE   
THEY WERE BUILT.                       
  FREDDY WORKS FOR E.C.L.P. HIS JOB HAS
NOW RE MECHANIZED AND COMPUTERIZED.    
THIS IS ALSO THE CASE WITH FARMING.    
  THE HOUSEWIFES JOB HAS GOT EASIER DUE
TO ENERGY SAVING MACHINES. BATHROOMS   
HAVE BEEN FITTED IN MANY HOUSES IN THE 
LAST 20 YEARS.                         
  THERE IS A GOOD LOCAL BUS SERVICE FOR
SHOPPING, BUT FREDDY GROWS HIS OWN     
FOOD.                                  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
