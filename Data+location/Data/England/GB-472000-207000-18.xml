{1870.}It had 2 classrooms and a bell  
 at the top of the school. The         
 playground was very small with high   
 walls all around. The girls used to   
 play{skipping and hopscotch.}The      
 toilets were outside.                 
 In those days the teachers were very  
 strict and{classes had about 60       
{children.}They had to write on{slates 
 which was very hard.                  
 There was{no electric light until     
{1932.}Sometimes children would have to
 stand in the corner with a dunce's cap
 on their head. The children had{maths 
 and{english}lessons and the girls used
 to{mend clothes for people}in the     
 village.
