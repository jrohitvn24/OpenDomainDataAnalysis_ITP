		<title>17THE PEDESTRIAN PRECINCT</title>
		<content>{SHOULD CARS BE ALLOWED ACCESS?        
  The main entrance to the Arndale     
 Shopping Centre is accessible for     
 pedestrians but also cars; young      
 mothers push prams in between moving  
 vehicles in a controversial area that 
 is known as a pedestrian precinct and 
 yet it is heavily used by these cars. 
 Most people who use the Arndale Centre
 complained bitterly about the danger  
 caused by these cars to shoppers and  
 young children. They claimed that the 
 precinct should either be for them, or
 for the cars, but not both. One mother
 stated that the danger on this        
 precinct made a hectic shopping day   
 even worse.                           
 On the other hand, the motorists claim
 that they are legally entitled to use 
 the area to reach the banks,but who is
 right?
