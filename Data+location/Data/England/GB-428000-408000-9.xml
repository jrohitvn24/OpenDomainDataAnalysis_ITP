		<content>   The main source of energy in our    
 area is{coal},and electricity pylons  
 cross the region as part of the       
 National Grid Network.Most of the area
 has been converted to natural{gas}and 
 there is an{oil}storage depot on a    
 nearby industrial estate.Within our   
 local environment we have Woolley     
 Colliery coalmine,which has recently  
 been enlarged to include a new washery
 and a coke preparation plant.At the   
 present time 1,350 men work at Woolley
 and it has annual output of 400,000   
 tons of coal per year.Most of the coal
 goes to near by power stations such as
 Ferrybridge and some goes to coking   
 plants.Approximately 60% of all       
 domestic fuel in our area is natural  
 gas however some outlying villages    
 such as Cawthorne are only just being 
 connected to the National Gas network.
