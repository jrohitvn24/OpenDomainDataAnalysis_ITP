		<content>{THE GHOST OF ACLE BRIDGE}             
 OLD ACLE BRIDGE WAS PULLED DOWN SOME  
 YEARS AGO,AND REPLACED BY A NEW       
 CONCRETE STRUCTURE.THIS IS A PITY,    
 BECAUSE THE BRICKWORK OF THE OLD      
 BRIDGE BORE A DARK RED STAIN,REPUTEDLY
 LEFT THERE WHEN A BRUTAL MURDER TOOK  
 PLACE TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO.ATTEMPTS  
 TO SCRUB AWAY THE BLOODSTAIN WERE     
 DOOMED TO FAILURE-BY MORNING THE RED  
 MARK HAD ALWAYS RETURNED.THE MURDER   
 IS WELL-DOCUMENTED,AND MANY PEOPLE    
 CLAIM TO HAVE SEEN IT RE-ENACTED ON   
 APRIL 7TH AT MIDNIGHT-THE ANNIVERSARY 
 OF THE FOUL DEED.                     
 MORE RECENTLY,CAR DRIVERS HAVE        
 REPORTED SEEING A HIDEOUS GLOWING     
 SKELETON LOLLING CARELESSLY AGAINST   
 THE PARAPET OF THE BRIDGE.
