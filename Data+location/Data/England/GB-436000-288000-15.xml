		<title>15STERLING METALS FACTORY</title>
		<content>  Sterling Metals employs about 1400   
 people.There are 4 foundaries in      
 total. About 1,500 castings are made  
 in the iron foundary. The heaviest    
 casting is the Morfax Plate weighing  
 about 5 tons and costing about        
 Â£7,500. Although fatal injuries are   
 very low(the last was in 1981), minor 
 injuries,such as eye injuries, give   
 cause for concern. The men are given  
 safety glasses, but many still do not 
 wear them. The biggest disaster was in
 1978 when there was an explosion.     
 Damage was done to nearby houses but  
 no one was injured. The last major    
 strike involving the whole company was
 in 1979. In 1983, there was a strike  
 involving one department. They have   
 their own works doctor,ambulance and  
 fire brigade,specially trained for    
 fires involving metal. There is a     
 work's club and many sporting clubs.  </content>
