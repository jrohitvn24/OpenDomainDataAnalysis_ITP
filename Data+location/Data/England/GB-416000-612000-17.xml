		<title>17THE TOWN HALL</title>
		<content> The Town Hall was built in 1200 by the
 freemen of Alnwick.  In 1728 they     
 decided to pull it down because it was
 old and falling down to start with.   
 The freemen started building straight 
 away and finished in 1736, 8 years    
 later.  The Town Hall cost Â£570 to    
 build again.  There are three rooms in
 the Town Hall: the Great Hall, the    
 kitchen and the chamber.  There used  
 to be three names for the Town Hall,  
 one the Weigh House because there was 
 a big scale that used to weigh horses 
 and carts.  The others were the Toll  
 House and the Counts.  There is a     
 cellar which used to be shops.  Today 
 coffee mornings and similar events are
 held there.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
