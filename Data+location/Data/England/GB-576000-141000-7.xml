		<title>07Dew Pond Study.</title>
		<content>   If you look at a map of our block   
 the first thing that you notice is    
 that there are a large number of dew  
 ponds. While many of these naturally  
 result from the clay soil a number of 
 them are old clay tile quarries. Most 
 are surrounded by trees and have some 
 have steep banks which are covered    
 with bluebells in early summer.       
   The pond that we surveyed included  
 among the surrounding trees oaks,     
 willows,rowan and hawthorn and vegetat
 -ion on the water consisted of water- 
 lilies,bullrushes and pond weed. We   
 caught broad-bodied dragonfly larvae, 
 two sticklebacks and six waterboatmen.
 We saw a pregnant female stickleback. 
 Then we caught a helobdella leech. on 
 the surface were moorhens and mallard 
 duck which feed on insects in and     
 around the pond.
