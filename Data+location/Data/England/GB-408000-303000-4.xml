		<content>We interviewed the Midland Bank        
manager in Shenstone. Business is      
fairly good in  Shenstone said mr      
Weetman. The bank deals with about     
100,000 pounds a week. On mondays and  
fridays nine people work in the bank.  
Each week about 800 people use the     
bank and 20 people under the age of    
16. The Sercuricor van comes about 2   
or 3 times a week. The bank has never  
been broken into. We asked him what    
his main ambition is and he said that  
he wanted to keep fit when he retires  
and play golf in his spare time. He    
showed us the safe which is a big room 
with bars in the doorway at night they 
put a big door over the bars of the    
safe and lock it up. The bank was a    
shop before it was turned into a bank  
in 1963.    A.BEARD &amp; K.HAWTHORN
