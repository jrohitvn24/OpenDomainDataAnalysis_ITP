{                                      
{ }In April 1943, 4 boys went          
 birdwatching in Hagley woods. They    
 noticed a large wych-elm, looked in,  
 and were alarmed to find a{skull      
{grinning}back at them. Upon more      
 detailed investigation, the local     
 police found it to be the decomposed  
 body of a 35 year old woman. She had  
 been murdered and her mouth had been  
 stuffed with cotton wool to prevent   
 her telling her tale. Although a shoe 
 and ring were later found nearby, her 
 identity was never discovered - hence 
 her nickname of "Bella."              
{Cut Throat Lane                       
{ } A 14 year old girl, finding herself
 to be{pregnant,}was said to have      
 committed suicide by cutting her own  
 throat. Her ghost supposedly haunts   
 the lane.                             </content>
