		<title>08THE E.C.M.R.W.F. CENTRE</title>
		<content> In 1967 17 European countries launched
 a project to build a meteorological   
 station that would be able to forecast
 the weather for the world for periods 
 of up to 10 days ahead.               
  The European Centre for Medium Range 
 Weather Forecasting was built at      
 Shinfield Park near Reading partly    
 because of its accessability to       
 London's Heathrow airport and partly  
 because of its proximity to an        
 existing major meteorological and     
 telecommunication centre at Bracknell 
 belonging to the Meteorological       
 Office.                               
  It is staffed by experienced         
 meteorologists from the 17 European   
 countries.It makes use of a massive   
 computer connected to thousands of    
 meteorological sensors distributed all
 over the world to provide the         
 necessary technical data.             </content>
