		<content>{MARBLES}- Marbles is a popular game.  
 There are about 4 different varieties 
 of games to play with marbles. One of 
 them is where you throw marbles into a
 circle and try and knock your         
 opponent's marbles out. Another game  
 is where you roll your marble and put 
 your feet round it and your opponent  
 rolls their marble at yours. There are
 two games of this sort, keeps and     
 friendlies. Another game is called    
 Birds in a Bush where you and your    
 opponent take turns in holding a      
 number of marbles. One person has to  
 guess how many marbles the other      
 person has. If you are correct you win
 the marbles. If you are incorrect you 
 give the opponent the number of       
 marbles you were wrong. A marble is a 
 round piece of glass with coloured    
 paper or plastic inside. You can also 
 get steel ones and crystal ones.      </content>
