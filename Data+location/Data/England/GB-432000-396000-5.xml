		<title>05A new housing estate.</title>
		<content> Behind our school, Macleans the       
 builders are building a new housing   
 estate. Eventually there will be over 
{600 houses}on this estate. There are  
 maisonettes, two, three and four      
 bedroomed houses. Some are detached,  
 some are semi-detached, some have     
 garages, others have en-suite shower  
 rooms. They are built mainly from     
 brick, but some have stone facing.    
 There are{no play areas or shops}on   
 the estate. All the houses have a     
 front and back garden. Some of the    
 bigger houses have balconies. We think
 the estate is being built here because
 we are on the edge of the city of     
{Sheffield near to the M1.}Many of the 
 children from school play on the      
 building site when the builders have  
 gone home, making dens and bicycle    
 tracks.   {Simon and Claire, aged 9.
