		<content>  The  majority  of  the  land   around
 Barnby   is   given   over  to  arable
 farming. There is  a  relatively small
 amount of mixed woodland  used  mainly
 for game cover, none of it being  used
 for commercial timber production.     
  As in many other parts of the country
 the majority of the  elm  trees  which
 grew in the  area  have  been  lost to
 Dutch Elm Disease. This, together with
 the present day farming fanaticism for
 uprooting hedgerows to give bigger and
 bigger fields, has  had a considerable
 effect on the appearance  and  ecology
 of the area.                          
  The principal crops grown in the area
 are  cereals,  with   sugar  beet  and
 oilseed  rape   being  used  as  break
 crops. Each year there is a surplus of
 straw  because  of low  local  demand.
 This results in  a  certain  amount of
 straw burning in the fields each year.</content>
