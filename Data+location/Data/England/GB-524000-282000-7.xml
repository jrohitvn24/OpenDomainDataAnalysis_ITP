		<title>07UPWOOD CHURCH(PART 1)</title>
		<content> If you look up where the{arches}are   
 you will see where the old windows    
 used to be.In Upwood church the       
 windows are nearly all plain glass    
 with wire through.Outside in the      
 graveyard there is a broken old wall. 
 The wall is supposed to be the{plague 
 wall.people who caught the plague were
 buried behind the wall.In the church  
 there is a little bit of stained glass
 on two windows.One of the windows is  
 beside Jesus's Cross.About 100 years  
 ago a priest stole the silver cup and 
 plate and sold them.The priest        
 disappeared and was never heard of    
 again.He was probably killed.
