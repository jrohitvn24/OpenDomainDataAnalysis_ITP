		<content> The Gloucestershire County Council    
 elections were held on 5th May 1985.  
 The polling stations were open from   
 8am-9pm.The votes were then counted in
 Stratford Park leisure centre.        
  Our 'D' block consists of one County 
 Council district,Painswick.The S.D.P. 
 and the Conservative party were the   
 only parties represented.The turn out 
 was 50% of the electorate voting.     
  The result was that the Conservative 
 coucillor for the last 7 years lost to
 Graham Marshall (S.D.P) standing for  
 the first time.The votes were S.D.P.  
 1676,and Conservatives 1666,votes.This
 swing to the centre occured in several
 places in the county and this led to a
 council in which no party had overall 
 control.S.D.P. Liberal Alliance 23    
 seats,Conservative and right wing     
 independents 23 seats,Labour 14 seats,
 others 3 seats.                       </content>
