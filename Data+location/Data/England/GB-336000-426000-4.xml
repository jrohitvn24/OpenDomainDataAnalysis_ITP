		<title>04CLUB DAY CONTINUED.</title>
		<content>   During the 19th Century,there       
 grew up many societies in the area and
 each year their members would gather  
 together in a local pub for their     
 annual meeting. There was much        
 good_humoured rivalry between         
 clubs.One year,accompanied by the town
 band,a Club decided to parade through 
 the streets before getting down to    
 business!The following year some other
 societies did the same thing carrying 
 their banners through the streets and 
 soon the clubs all agreed to hold     
 their meetings on the same day.       
   During Queen Victoria's reign the   
 celebrations expanded to include a    
 market and a fair every third Saturday
 in June.Towards the end of the last   
 Century the schools were in the{Club  
{Day}procession.The first Lytham Club  
 Day Rose Queen was crowned in 1894 and
 this custom has continued ever since. </content>
