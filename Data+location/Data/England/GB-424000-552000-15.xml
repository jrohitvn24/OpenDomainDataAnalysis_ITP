		<title>15SHOPPING HABITS</title>
		<content>   The second year children of OUSTON  
 JUNIOR SCHOOL carried out a survey of 
 shopping habits.                      
                                       
   They found out that most people,over
 90%,do their major shopping outside of
 the village. They have to travel to   
 the large supermarkets in Birtley and 
 Washington as there are no large      
 stores in the village. Most people did
 their shopping at Presto in Birtley   
 and Sava Centre in Washington.        
                                       
   To keep down travelling expenses    
 over 80% of the people questioned did 
 their shopping once a fortnight and   
 nearly 10% only once a month.         
                                       
   97% of those surveyed did their main
 shopping in supermarkets and only 3%  
 in smaller shops.
