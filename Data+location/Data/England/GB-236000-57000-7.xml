		<title>07TREVOLLARD FARM - TREMATON</title>
		<content> Trevollard farm covers about 75 acres 
 and holds some 320 sheep and 40       
 cattle. The farmer, brought up in     
 London bought the farm in 1975 after  
 spending 8 years in New Zealand. His  
 Leeds born wife lived in South Africa 
 before joining him. Together they took
 over what had been an arable/market   
 gardening farm in the same hands for  
 some 49 years.                        
 The farmhouse dates from the 1850s,   
 reputedly built by a smuggler and     
 having underground passages. At one   
 time it served as an Old Peoples home.
 Electricity and mains water reached it
 in 1967. During World War II German   
 Prisoners were employed here. A quarry
 was apparently dug in 1850, the same  
 year in which dock dung was introduced
 - rubbish from the streets of Plymouth
 sold for eight pounds per 200 tons.
