		<title>16Garton C.E. Church Part 1</title>
		<content> St.  Michael and All Angels Church    
 is the oldest and most beautiful      
 building in Garton. It was built by   
 Prior John of Kirkham Abbey in 1132.  
 The plain, aisleless structure is     
 predominantly Norman in style. The    
 church has a chancel, south porch and 
 massive west tower. A great           
 restoration took place in 1856 largely
 financed by Sir Tatton Sykes of       
 Sledmere House. The chancel and the   
 nave were rebuilt but not the south   
 wall. The tower was repaired and the  
 bells re-hung. A rare and unique      
 feature of the church is the interior 
 decoration. Every space on the walls  
 and roof has been painted with bible  
 scenes and patterns. These were done  
 by two artists, Clayton and Bell,     
 between 1872-80 costing Â£8,000. The   
 formal mosaic floors are black, white 
 and yellow.                           </content>
