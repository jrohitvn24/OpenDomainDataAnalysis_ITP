 In our survey we discovered that      
 families who owned cars bought most of
 their groceries, meat, bread, fruit   
 and vegetables outside our survey     
 area.They drove either to Richmod,    
 Northallerton or Darlington.          
                                       
 Shoes and clothes were bought mainly  
 in Darlington where there is a wider  
 selection of shops.Quite a large      
 proportion of people, however, chose  
 shoes and clothing from catalogues.   
                                       
 The shops in Scorton village are found
 useful by older people and those who  
 do not drive.Children buy most of     
 their sweets in them.                 
                                       
 Travelling shops are appreciated by   
 those in outlying areas, especially if
 they are not near the bus route.      </content>
