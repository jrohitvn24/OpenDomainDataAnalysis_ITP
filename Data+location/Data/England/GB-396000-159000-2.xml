 mantled railway line.  At the bottom  
 of the long hill, the railway line    
 originally bridged the road to        
 then run parallel with the canal.     
    The village of Poulshot, mentioned 
 in the first Domesday Book, lies to   
 the west of the main road on the lower
 land around Devizes.  The principal   
 feature of the village is the large   
 green, on which cricket is regularly  
 played against other clubs on a       
 league basis.

 other businesses include a private    
 building firm and a small micro-      
 electronics firm.
