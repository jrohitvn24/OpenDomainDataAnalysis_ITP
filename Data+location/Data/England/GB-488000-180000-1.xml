		<title>01MAIDENHEAD - in 1985</title>
		<content>   Maidenhead is a town that is seeing 
 alot of change at present.1985 has    
 seen the replacement of Brunel's      
 railway bridge and the refurbishment  
 of the shopping precinct at a cost of 
 over Â£2 million.Old buildings have    
 been demolished and office blocks have
 replaced them,but not to everyones    
 satisfaction.The most controversial   
 was the office block nicknamed "The   
 Green Giant" because of its colour and
 size.1985 has also seen Maidenhead's  
 last cinema,The ABC, disappear to make
 way for office development.           
                                       
  Despite all this development and     
 change Maidenhead is still a desirable
 place to live.It has good road and    
 rail links with London and the river  
 with its beautiful riverside scenery.
