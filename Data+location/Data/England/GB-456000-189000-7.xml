		<content>{Bell Garage}My Dad runs Bell Garage   
and he has worked there for 12 years.  
Four people work for him. He sells     
petrol at about 190p a gallon and      
diesel fuel. He services cars and      
repairs the bodywork of damaged        
vehicles. He also does M.O.T. tests    
for older cars. He also sells spare    
parts, oil and cold drinks. In the past
years the garage has been much improved
by the addition of new petrol pumps, a 
spray shop and a new M.O.T. testing    
bay. The garage can be found on High   
Road, Brightwell.
