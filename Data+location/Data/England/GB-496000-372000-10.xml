		<title>10YARBOROUGH SPORTS CENTRE</title>
		<content> Yarborough Sports Centre was opened in
 1976 by Graham Taylor, then Manager of
 Lincoln City F.C.  With the Centre was
 a 25 metre swimming pool, diving area 
 and a beginner's pool. Also four      
 squash courts, two outdoor tennis     
 courts and gymnasium and sports hall. 
 Also a 400 metre running track with   
 grandstand and all track and field    
 event facilities.  Later on was built 
 a 5-a-side football, all weather      
 square and BMX track.  Sharing the    
 centre was Yarborough High School,    
 (built before the Centre), they use   
 all the facilities. Swimming there is 
 very cheap for three quarters of an   
 hour.  All facilities are open to the 
 public, but all have to be payed for. 
 A variety of clubs are held. The      
 Centre is designed to relieve boredom 
 amongst people and to get them        
 involved in sport.   Tim Priestley 13.</content>
