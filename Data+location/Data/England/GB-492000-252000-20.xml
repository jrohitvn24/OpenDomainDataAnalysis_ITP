		<content> Cold Brayfield (population around 70) 
 is a cluster of farm buildings and    
 cottages belonging to the Brayfield   
 Estate, which has been in the same    
 family since 1648. Brayfield House has
 a Regency front but the older Queen   
 Anne manor house can be seen from the 
 back. Requisitioned by the Royal      
 Ordnance Corps in the 1939-45 War,    
 today the house is divided into 8     
 flats. It is said to be haunted by the
 White Lady since her grave was robbed 
 100 years ago. The farm is            
 mixed-arable, beef cattle and sheep.  
 Local schoolchildren are regularly    
 taken on farm walks at various times  
 of the year. The Church of St. Mary,  
 is a small, early English structure   
 with some Norman work. It was         
 completely restored in 1881.
