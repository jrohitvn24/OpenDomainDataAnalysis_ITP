		<content> Scotton pantomine has become a new    
 tradition in recent years, and the 3  
 performances play to a packed and     
 appreciative audience in the village  
 hall. It is very much a village enter-
 tainment being written and produced by
 husband and wife Tom and Coreen Brown,
 who like the rest of the Drama Group  
 live in Scotton.The group has also put
 on plays by Priestley and Rattigan.The
 WI Drama Group usually gives an annual
 production, the 1985 one written and  
 produced by 2 WI members. Scotton has 
 benefitted from the Lincolnshire &amp;    
 Humberside Arts subsidised tours for  
 professional companies with visits    
 from Hull Truck, Durham Theatre and   
 Webb-Foote companies.This year L &amp; HA 
 introduced a scheme for tours by young
 professional musicians: recitals for  
 guitar in April, flute and harp in    
 November - all in the Village Hall.   </content>
