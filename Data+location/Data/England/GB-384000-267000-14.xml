		<content> With the exception of the three square
 kilometres along the western edge, the
 block is almost entirely composed of  
{livestock}farming country, with a     
 little woodland. This is mainly       
 deciduous and not commercially        
 managed. The western part is, for the 
 most part, devoted to{commercial fruit
{and vegetable growing.}               
                                       
 The{Hartlebury Trading Estate}is      
 devoted mainly to light industry and  
 storage and there are large{grain}    
 stores there. The only village in the 
 block is{Cutnall Green.}This is quite 
 a small village and most of the       
 inhabitants{commute}to nearby towns   
 for employment.
