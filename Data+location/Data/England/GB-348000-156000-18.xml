		<title>18ST. ANDREW'S CHURCH, BLAGDON</title>
		<content> There have been{four churches}in      
 Blagdon before this one. Others       
 collapsed because graves were under   
 the walls.It was rebuilt in{1913.     
 There are three altars each with a    
 cross on top of it or behind it.The   
 altars are always to the east of most 
 churches, but in modern churches it is
 in the middle.To the left of the main 
 altar is the{Chapel of the Good       
{Shepherd,}so called because there is a
 statue of Jesus carrying a stray lamb 
 home.There are ten rows of pews and   
 five aisles. There is an old{Norman   
{font}where babies are Christened.     
 The Rector is the Rev.C.Hadley and the
 organist/choirmaster is Mr. Wood. I am
 one of the Head Choristers. We boys   
 wear surplices,cassocks and ruffs     
 but the men don't wear ruffs. Ladies  
 and girls wear red coats with white   
 cuffs and tassels.                    </content>
