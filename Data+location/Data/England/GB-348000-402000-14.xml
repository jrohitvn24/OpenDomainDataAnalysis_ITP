		<content>   The number of stray dogs in the area
is another worrying factor, with the   
problems they bring - scattering bins  
and fouling the pavements.             
   The lack of facilities in the urban 
area have given rise for concern.      
   There is a significant lack of play 
areas and equipment for young children.
Those facilities which were offered    
have destroyed by vandals and not      
replaced.                              
   It was felt by many people that this
area does not provide entertainment    
suitable to teenagers. Liverpool and   
other major towns are not easily       
accessible and are to expensive to     
visit. Most young people themselves    
singled out the lack of night life -   
discos etc. - as the chief problem.
