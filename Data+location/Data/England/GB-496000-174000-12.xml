		<title>12SAVE OUR SWANS</title>
		<content> Zyllah Cooke is the Windsor-based     
 founder of Save Our Swans, a          
 registered charity set up to look     
 after the hundreds of swans on the    
 Thames being injured and killed by    
 swallowing lead weights left by       
 anglers and recently by seemingly     
 deliberate cruelty.Drink can rings and
 plastic bags have been found tied on  
 swans . A recent case of shooting by  
 pellets caused massive infection and  
 later death.The centre is run from    
 Zyllah's back garden where in 1984 273
 birds were treated by the voluntary   
 helpers backed by the professional    
 skill of Zyllah's vetinary surgeon    
 husband Stephen,a leading authority   
 on mute swans.Her garden is too small 
 and she is seeking new premises.She is
 hoping that government plans to ban   
 the sale of lead weights will soon    
 become law. by Verity and Clare       </content>
