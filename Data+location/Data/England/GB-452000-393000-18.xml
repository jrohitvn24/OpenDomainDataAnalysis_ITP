		<title>18The Village Playing Field</title>
		<content> Braithwell Parish Council brought the 
 land for the Playing Field, which was 
 officially opened in 1980. A 2p Rate  
 precept was levied to buy the land    
 from a local farmer. A football pitch 
 was ready for use first and a club was
 formed, who play in the local league. 
 Mrs.N.Gardener donated Â£1,000 towards 
 cricket facilities, in memory of her  
 late husband. A Bowling Green is now  
 ready for play and a Club is in       
 formation. Local farmers, villagers   
 and the quarry have all worked        
 together in the preparation of the    
 Playing Field. At present there are   
 two buildings used as changing rooms  
 and as a meeting place for Guides,    
 Brownies, Playgroup, etc. A toilet    
 block was built through the Youth     
 Opportunities Scheme, with materials  
 provided by the Playing Field         
 Committee.                            </content>
