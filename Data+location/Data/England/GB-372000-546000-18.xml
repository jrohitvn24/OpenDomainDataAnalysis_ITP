		<title>18The Youth Club, Alston Moor</title>
		<content> The group meets in The Topp twice a   
 week on Mondays and Wednesdays from   
 7.30 p.m. to 9.30 p.m. during school  
 term time.  The club is run by a      
{leader and two assistants}who are     
 employed by Cumbria County Council.   
 There should be a member's committee  
 and a management committee but nobody 
 wants to belong so organisation is    
 left to the leaders.  There are{80    
{members}but theyt do not attend all   
 meetings.  The activities are         
 five-a-side football, table tennis,   
 disco-dancing, table games, board     
 games, cards and ccomputer and C.B.   
 Radio.  Sometimes they go swimming,   
 roller skating, on trips to places or 
 visits to other youth clubs.  Most of 
 the members go to Samuel King's       
 School, but they can be members until 
 they are 21 years old.
