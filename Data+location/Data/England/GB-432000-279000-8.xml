		<content> Courtaulds is famous in industry for  
 textiles.  Its  chimney which is part 
 of Coventry's landscape took 18 months
 to build in 1923. Mr. Seal came to our
 school to talk about it.  He explained
 that it was built of different        
  coloured bricks because that was     
 fashionable then.  The chimney which  
 was damaged in World War II is the    
 biggest in England.  It was built to  
 preserve the ecology of the area by   
 getting rid of the horrible fumes and 
 stopping pollution.  The fumes were   
 coming from the fabric that was       
 being made .  The chimney was not     
  sooty because it was not used for    
 burning coal.  It was to improve      
 health.  Altogether there were 917,000
 bricks used.  The normal house brick  
 was used for the base and that used   
 604,500 but the rest of the chimney   
 was different and that used 312,500.  </content>
