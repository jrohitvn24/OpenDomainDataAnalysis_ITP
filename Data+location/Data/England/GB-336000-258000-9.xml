		<content> The older inhabitants refered to the  
 village as "Stan".                    
 In this remote and thinly populated   
 village the natives speak quite good  
 English without many of the "Oldy     
 Worldy" words one hears in near by    
 villages.                             
{Grammer}has significantly improved due
 to education and an influx of people  
 from all over the country.            
 The {Accents}have a definate welsh    
 lilt mixed with the Herefordshire open
 vowles.We believe that we have an     
 accent of our own which is intresting 
 and pleasent to ear.                  
{Dialect}is less pronounced than in the
 past.Words are used with differant    
 meanings than the norm,e.g.:          
             {Starved= meaning cold    
{             Nesh= feels the cold     
{        In Her Doubles=Old and Bent   
{           A strat =A mean man        </content>
