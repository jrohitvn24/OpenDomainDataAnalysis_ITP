		<content>     Mrs.Allies has lived in the area  
 for seven years. She is very much     
 interested in communities. Also she   
 thinks it is a peaceful area and good 
 for bringing up children. The house is
 fairly new. There used to be two      
 cottages there. Again, she doesn't    
 mind the country smells and if she had
 a chance to move she would move by the
 sea.                                  
   Mrs.Bennett has been living in the  
 area for one year. She used to be a   
 teacher. She lives in a very old house
 with a crook beam. She also is        
 interested in communities and likes   
 doing mens jobs. She also doesn't mind
 the country smells. She would like to 
 have a shop and a school nearby.
