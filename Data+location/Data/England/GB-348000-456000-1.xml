		<content> The majority of our block is farmland 
 with deciduous trees. It is hilly &amp; is
 used for grazing cows &amp; sheep. The M6 
 motorway runs north/south with 6 lanes
 &amp; 2 hard shoulders, along the valley. 
 The Blea Tarn Reservoir built in      
 1903 supplies water with two others,  
 to Morcambe, Heysham &amp; Lancaster. The 
 A6 main road runs parallel to the M6  
 but on the east side carries all the  
 traffic to the University of Lancaster
 which includes 1400 cars each week    
 day. In 1974 the railway was          
 electrified and runs north to south.  
 The Intercity 125 reaches 125 mph     
 here.The University of Lancaster was  
 opened in 1964 and is built on a      
 plateau on an impressive site. 4000   
 students study here and 2500 live in  
 the university. It has brought much to
 the area eg education, recreation     
 employment, trade and culture.        </content>
