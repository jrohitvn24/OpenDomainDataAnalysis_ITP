		<content>  There has been a constant decline    
 over the last six years of jobs in the
 traditional local industries such as  
 mining,nearby glass works and         
 confectionary.In addition,a large     
 nearby colliery is about to close     
 while the Pontefract Colliery will    
 remain under threat with its current  
 financial losses.                     
  Unemployment is above the national   
 average and stands at 14%.2,000 people
 are unemployed at present time,an     
 increase of over 5% on the previous   
 year.                                 
  Future unemployment may  be helped   
 by some projected extensions in  light
 industries.                           
   The town has a tradition for a large
  number of jobs for females.Liquorice 
 factories and clothing works together 
 with light engineering works have even
 provided jobs to suit "family hours". </content>
