		<title>02HOLMESFIELD'S LOCAL HISTORY</title>
		<content> The earliest surviving remains in the 
 area are the high mounds or knowles   
 built by Neolithic folk and around    
 which hut circles were built.         
 Later the Romans built Rumbling       
 Street, which skirts the Southern     
 boundary of our area,from the lead    
 mining areas of the Peak District to  
 Chesterfield. The Angles used the     
 Neolithic 'mounds'to build their      
 'cruck' Halls or 'aulas' and they also
 built the mill near the ford ,the     
 settlement now called Millthorpe .    
   The conquering Normans built a Motte
 and Bailey castle from which the moat 
 and castle mill is still visible.Lead 
 smelting on windy Bole hills to the   
 west of the area brought wealth to    
 Holmesfield families in the 1500's and
 the aulas were developed into fine    
 Tudor halls. Ancient crosses still    
 mark the original pack horse trails.  </content>
