		<title>14Farming - Part-time Farmers.</title>
		<content> Much of the land in this block is     
 unimproved rough pasture suitable only
 for sheep grazing. On the lower       
 margins, however, where some          
 improvement has taken place, some beef
 and dairy cattle are kept.            
  The land generally is too high and   
 the rainfall too heavy for cereal     
 growing even in the most favoured     
 parts - but silage and hay crops are  
 produced for winter feed.             
  The growing season is shorter here   
 than in many parts, and dairy cattle  
 are brought indoors usually in        
 November and are rarely turned out    
 into the fields until early May.      
  Because of the small size of some    
 farms and the unproductive nature of  
 the land, some farms are run by       
 part-time farmers who have other      
 occupations during the daytime.
