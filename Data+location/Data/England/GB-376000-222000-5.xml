		<content> Despite the fact that the community is
 spread over a wide area, the Village  
 Hall provides a centre for social     
 activities. The original wooden       
 building was opened by Mrs. Gordon    
 Canning in 1901. In 1977 an extension 
 in brick was constructed to           
 accommodate toilets, kitchen,         
 committee room and stage. In the      
 future it is proposed to replace the  
 original eastern wall with brick and  
 build a storeroom on the north        
 side. The Village Hall is administered
 by an elected, voluntary committee who
 raise funds by organising annual      
 functions including Harvest Supper,   
 Spring Supper Dance and Summer Fete.  
 The'100 Club', an offshoot of the     
 committee, was started principally to 
 raise funds for Village Hall          
 improvements through twice yearly     
 draws and social evenings.            </content>
