		<content> The area has two main principal       
 features namely {Thornley Woods}and   
{The River Derwent}.                   
 The River Derwent is responsible for  
 the vallied nature of the surrounding 
 area.Along the valley runs the popular
 Derwent Walk which runs from the town 
 of Swalwell to the old steel working  
 town of Consett.The Derwent Walk      
 follows the path that the old mineral 
 line used to take to Consett Steel    
 Works .                               
 Thornley Woods and the associated area
 of Snipes Dene Wood are both open to  
 the general public and are used by    
 scools and community at large.        
 The area contains two villages,a      
 hamlet and part of the town of        
 Whickham .The remaining land is mainly
 mixed farm land.
