		<title>19Shopping in our block</title>
		<content> We carried out a survey of the        
 shopping habits of people in our      
 block. We found that shoppers who     
 lived in Farncombe mostly walked to   
 the local shops but those who lived   
 further afield came by car. Most      
 people interviewed were local, but a  
 few came from Godalming. The old      
 people who were interviewed used the  
 shops every day but most people said  
 they used the shops only occasionally 
 for odd items rather than their main  
 shop of the week. The Post Office     
 proved to be the most frequently used 
 service. The most popular shop for    
 produce was found to be the Co-op     
 supermarket. Fruit and vegetables were
 the items that people tended to buy at
 the most frequent intervals. Shoppers 
 also mentioned the lack of good       
 parking facilities.
