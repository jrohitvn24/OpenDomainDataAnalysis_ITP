		<content>    This square is mainly covered by{  
{Cultivated Grass.}It is highly managed
 by the farmers. There is also a small 
{Deciduous woodland}in this square.    
    There are very few houses in this  
 square, and those which are, are for  
 workers on the{Westminster Estate.    
{  }The land in this square is all     
 privately owned by the estate, and all
 Housing is rented accomodation.

{      }All the residents of this      
 square were happy with the quiet lives
 which they live. They said that       
 occasionly it is necessary to visit   
 the major city, which is several miles
 away, but this is alright because     
 travel is simple via good roads and a 
 good bus service.
