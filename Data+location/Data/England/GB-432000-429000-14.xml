		<content>      On Wednesday afternoon Mr Goakes 
 took a large group of us to see how   
 many interesting things there were to 
 see.                                  
      Firstly, we saw a church called  
{St. Hilda's}and on the same lane there
 was a{Youth Training Hostel,}a        
 take-away, a post office and a Skoda  
 garage. Right at the end of the road  
 was a pub.                            
      We went round a corner and there 
 was a{hairdresser's,}a{chippy,}and a  
 bit further down there was a{petrol   
{station.                              
      We crossed the{Green Bridge}and  
 it brought us onto{Pontefract Lane.   
 Across the street there was a big     
 block of office suites. Further down, 
 there was a{glass factory}and back on 
 our side of the road there was a      
{spring factory}and two{tool dealers.
