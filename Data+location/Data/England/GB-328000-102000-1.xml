		<title>01GENERAL REVIEW</title>
		<content> Our block,which we are covering       
 consists of farm land,a Village,three 
 Hamlets, the River Kit which          
 eventually flows into the River Axe   
 and Woodland.The area of our blocks   
 covers a total of 12 square kms.From  
 the top of the church tower we can see
 most of the block we are covering for 
 the project e.g. farms, woodland,     
 buildings and footpaths.The contryside
 consists of a series of hills and     
 valleys.There is one main road into   
 the village from the Chard Axminster  
 trunk road known as the Fosse Way.The 
 older buildings are predominately     
 constructed of stone with a number of 
 thatched roofs.There are mordern      
 Council houses and some light industry
 units.Although there are many retired 
 residents there is a lively young     
 population which needs to be          
 encouraged to remain.                 </content>
