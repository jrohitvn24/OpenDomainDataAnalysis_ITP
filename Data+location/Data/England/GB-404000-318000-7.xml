		<title>07YOUTH OPPORTUNITIES, RUGELEY</title>
		<content> Because youth unemployment is so high 
 in 1985, the Government has introduced
 a Youth Training Scheme (YTS). The aim
 is to train school leavers with few or
 no qualifications in a useful skill to
 equip them for finding a full time    
 job. There is a Careers Office and Job
 Centre in Rugeley but these cannot    
 overcome the basic problem of the     
 shortage of jobs. Most teenagers in   
 Rugeley stay at school as long as they
 can, to get extra qualifications, or  
 they go to the Colleges of Further    
 Education at Cannock or Stafford. Few 
 are able to find a full time job      
 immediately on leaving school. Some do
 not try to find work and are content  
 to live at home on Social Security    
 payments. Generally young people in   
 Rugeley think that job prospects are  
 bleak but they may be improved when   
 new jobs are attracted to the area.   </content>
