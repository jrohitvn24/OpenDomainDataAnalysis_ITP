		<title>18Memories of Newburn Village</title>
		<content> and of course the world famous        
 Spencers Steel Works.                 
   Most of the traffic was horse drawn,
 we had a large horse trough and a     
 trap.There was an off license which   
 supplied beer by the bucketfull for   
 the steel workers.When the steel works
 were working Newburn was a thriving   
 shopping centre.Money was short,people
 were much more neighbourly and        
 friendly.                             
   Bill Stobbarts pig farm used to be  
 in the field that is fenced off,next  
 to Moor Ct.Next to it,on the edge of  
 the Tyne ,is an old black wooden      
 hut,standing half in the water,and    
 half on the land.This was the Water   
 Bailif's home.Part of his job was to  
 row people over the Tyne to Ryton     
 Willows for a penny.Boats from        
 S.Shields used to come there in summer
 for Hoppings etc.(Mr J.Lackenby)      </content>
