		<title>07SAMSON FOX. 1831-1903.</title>
		<content>   {Sansom Fox}was born in Leeds in    
 1831 and later owned{Leeds Forge}which
 made pressed steel, underframes and   
 bogies for railway rolling stock. In  
 1881 he bought{Grove hHouse} from the 
 Greenwoods of Swarcliffe Hall and     
 immediately set about enlarging and   
 altering the house, a tall grim grey  
 building which looked towards a heathy
 common later to become the{Stray.}No  
 expence was spared for his new home.  
    He was Mayor of Harrogate on three 
 occasions and did much to promote its'
 prosperity as a Spa. A plaque at the  
 north end of the Stray near Skipton   
 Road commemorates his roasting of an  
 ox on the{Diamond Jubilee of Queen    
{Victoria.}He died in 1903.
