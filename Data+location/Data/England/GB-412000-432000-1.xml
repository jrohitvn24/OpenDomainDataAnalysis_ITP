		<content> Our block of{Bradford West}contains a 
 mixture of farmland,suburb and indust-
 rial premises with associated housing.
 The block is traversed by the valley  
 of{Clayton Beck}whose water once pow- 
 ered Bradford's{worsted industry.}Many
 of the victorian woollen mills are now
 either derelict or demolished.They    
 are being replaced by light-industrial
 units and small housing developments. 
 The 19th. century terraced housing has
 been either demolished in slum clear- 
 ance schemes or improved to a standard
 far beyond the original.The block has 
 a{multi-ethnic population}with many   
 people,particularly those living near-
 est the city centre,having Pakistani, 
 Bangladeshi or Indian backgrounds.    
 Bradford University,Bradford + Ilkley 
 Community College are in the block as 
 are the city's two main hospitals- St.
 Luke's and Bradford Royal Infirmary.  </content>
