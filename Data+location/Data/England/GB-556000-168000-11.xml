		<title>11ROYAL OAK COTTAGE</title>
		<content>     This 2-storey house stands near   
 the south end of the main street in   
{Horton Kirby.}It dates from the early 
 1600's and is built of brick around a 
 wooden frame. The walls rest upon a   
 flint base, and there is no damp      
 course.                               
     The name of the cottage derives   
 from its former use as a public-house.
 No spirits were sold: it was          
 exclusively an ale-house. Boys had to 
 sit on a bench in the porch to drink  
 their lemonade.                       
    The building fell into such        
 disrepair that it was condemned just  
 before the Second World War. In 1946, 
 following a grant for restoration, the
 cottage was first reduced to its      
 original timber structure, and then   
 entirely rebuilt. An extension cons-  
 isting of a kitchen and bathroom was  
 later added to the rear of the house. </content>
