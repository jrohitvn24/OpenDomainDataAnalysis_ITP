		<title>20HIGH CROSS SCHOOL./CREDITS.</title>
		<content> The{"Puller Memorial"}primary school  
 was founded in 1866. The name comes   
 from the local family of Giles-Puller 
 who lived at Youngsbury in the C19th  
 and were responsible for building the 
 nearby church in 1856. It is still    
 a very small school,employing only 2  
 full-time teachers and 1 part-timer.  
 Most of the children come from the    
 nearby village of Colliers End.       
 Some of the secondary school age      
 children of High Cross travel to      
 school in Ware and a number of these  
 attend Presdales School.              
{                                      
{Presdales would like take this        
{opportunity to thank all the pupils   
{and staff who have contributed to the 
{Domesday Project and all the members  
{of the public who so kindly answered  
{our questions. }
