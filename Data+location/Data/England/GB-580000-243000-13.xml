		<content>   When it's wet weather we often do   
 Country Dancing in the hall. Mr Finch 
 has the music on cassette and he      
 teaches us the steps. It is really    
 good fun. And every year, around May  
 Day, the schools meet at Wethersfield 
 and we have the{US Air Force gym.}The 
 programme lasts all day and you get   
 quite tired; Mr Finch says 'You aren't
 here to be{wallflowers}!'. We made our
 own skirts and neckerchiefs in class  
 and they look nice.                   
   We used to have recorded music but  
 this year there was a{band}of three,  
 which was great.  They played Yellow  
 Rose of Texas, and I Want to be near  
 You etc. When it's square or long sets
 we try to stick together; I feel shy. 
 But when it's huge circles (some      
 inside others) you really have to{mix 
 up. I suppose it's really a good way  
 to make new friends.                  </content>
