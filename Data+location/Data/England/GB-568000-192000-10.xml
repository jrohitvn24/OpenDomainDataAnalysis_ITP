   The people in our area have a choice
 of public transport; trains, taxis,   
 and buses .However, the trains are    
 just out of the area.Most of the older
 people tend to rely on public         
 transport while the younger people    
 usually have their own vehicles, such 
 as a motor bike or small car.In our   
 survey most families have at least one
 car, some two and sometimes even three
 The fuel our vehicles use is becoming 
 quite scarce and the price is steadily
 going up.At the moment it is almost   
 two pounds a gallon,but this has not  
 deterred people from driving their    
 cars.The reason that cars are more    
 popular than buses and trains is that 
 the car provides a door to door       
 service.
