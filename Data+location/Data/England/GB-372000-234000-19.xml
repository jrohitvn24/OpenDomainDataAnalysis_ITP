		<content> Most local events are held at Eastnor 
 Castle or Bromesberrow Place. There   
 are several traditional annual events,
 these include School and Church fetes,
 a Carol Party, held at Bromesberrow   
 Place, and the Harvest Suppers. The   
 Forestry Commission hold regular      
 meetings on the Estates. The Village  
 Halls in Bromesberrow and Eastnor are 
 also used for various events such as  
 whist drives, meetings and dances.    
 Charity and fund raising functions are
 held regularly at Eastnor Castle.     
 Eastnor has a cricket team, a bowling 
 green and a sports' ground, but       
 although there is a sports' ground by 
 the Village Hall in Bromesberrow there
 have been no local teams for several  
 years.
