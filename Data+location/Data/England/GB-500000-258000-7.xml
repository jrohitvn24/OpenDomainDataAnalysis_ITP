		<content> During the late winter of spring of   
 1985 a large lay-by off the A6 was the
 home of a group of so called "Peace   
 People".The group,some one hundred and
 fifty in number,had previously been   
 evicted from R.A.F. Molesworth in     
 Cambridgeshire where they had been    
 protesting about the proposed siting  
 of American nuclear cruise missiles.  
 These people spend a gypsy like       
 lifestyle in a wide assortment of     
 mobile homes-these include everything 
 from traditional caravans and tents to
 converted coaches and North American  
 Indian style tepees.                  
 They recieved with mixed feelings by  
 the local villagers and watched over  
 twenty four hours a day by the local  
 police.There was a general feeling of 
 relief when they eventually moved to  
 Wiltshire to join other groups        
 assembling near Stonehenge.           </content>
