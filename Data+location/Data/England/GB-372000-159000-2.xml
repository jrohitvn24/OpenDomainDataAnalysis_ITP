		<title>02       BEAR  FLAT</title>
		<content>      The Bear Flat is the centre of   
 our kilometre square that we have been
 studying.However,it has nothing to do 
 with bears as you might think.On the  
 Bear Flat there are many shops and the
 most well known public attraction is  
 the Bear Inn.This Inn is well noted   
 for the large polar bear that sits on 
 the porch of the entrance.The Bear    
 Flat is in the Lyncombe Ward of which 
 the population is 5313.Leading off    
 from the Bear Flat are 4 Edwardian    
 avenues.                              
        Also in the region of the Bear 
 Flat area is a sloping playing field  
 which is used by many members of the  
 public.Right next to the playing field
 are some allotments which are mainly  
 used by the residents around          
 them.There are many different houses  
 in the area that were built in        
 different centuries.                  </content>
