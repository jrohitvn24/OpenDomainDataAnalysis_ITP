		<content> Marie and Kirsty decided to go and ask
 the farm owners or workers about the  
 farm. People responded and helped     
 very well,and we were very interested.
{Wheat}and{barley}seems to be mostly   
 grown.Most of the people we           
 interviewed were tenent farmers,but   
 one was the owner and he said that    
 when he started working on the farm in
 August,nineteen thirty nine he had to 
 employ two and a half men (not        
 literally)to every hundred acres,but  
 now he farms two thousand acres.This  
 means that he should be employing     
 fifty men now but in fact he only     
 employs eight.They all said they enjoy
 working on the farm.Most people said  
 that things have changed much over the
 years,and they are very pleased that  
 they have,because now they have so    
 much mechanical machinery they don't  
 get worn out so much.                 </content>
