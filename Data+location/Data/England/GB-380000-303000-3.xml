		<content> As a small boy in the early 1920's a  
 group of Serbian gypsies camped on    
 Kingswood Common, having travelled all
 over Europe. One day they all came    
 into the village, swarthy men with    
 dark bewhiskered faces,the women with 
 bright dresses, accompanied by their  
 native horses and dogs. They          
 entertained the village, with their   
 dancing bears, and monkeys on barrels 
 or cans,the gypsies performed their   
 native dances.                        
  Albrighton was also well known for   
 its May day fair, special trains being
 run from the Black Country and many   
 horse drawn vehicles coming by road.  
 There were no street lights. The      
 railway station was very busy. Being  
 the centre for despatching sugar beet 
 to Alscott factory and timber to      
 wolverhamton. An interview with
