		<title>19The Role of the Farmhouse</title>
		<content>     Nowadays not all original         
 farmhouses are connected to the       
 farming industry. Being usually       
 large and built from very attractive  
 Jersey granite they have become a much
 sought after residence for wealthy    
 immigrants and locals. In many cases  
 they have been extensively modernised 
 and such luxury features as swimming  
 pools and tennis courts added. Not    
 only is the role of the farmhouse     
 changing but also that of surrounding 
 farm buildings. Granite barns have    
 also become available because of the  
 decreasing size of the average cow    
 herd and the need for fewer farming   
 implements owing to mechanisation.    
 Thus they also are much desired for   
 conversion into dwelling units.       
 Examples of this can be found along La
 Rue De Bechet in St. John.
