		<title>15My Street</title>
		<content> My street is called Bramble Road.It is
 a very noisy road because on one side 
 is Techno Techno Trading Estate and on
 the other side is Coopers scrap       
  yard.It is not only the factories    
 that make it noisy it's the cars and  
 lorries that go to them.Bramble Road  
 has got 2 different kinds of homes    
 there is houses and bungalows, I live 
 in a house.The bungalows have got the 
 biggest gardens.My street is always   
 dirty because the council hardly ever 
 sends a road sweeper to clean it.
