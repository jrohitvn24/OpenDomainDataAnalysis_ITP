		<title>14The D Road</title>
		<content>Mrs.Nichols has lived in Stoke-on-Trent
for seventeen years.While she was      
resident in North Street a major       
D.Road  was built nearby.We asked Mrs  
Nichols about the D.Road.While the     
D.Road was being built the surrounding 
area became dirty.A railway yard,and a 
canal were demolished to make way for  
this road. At the time there were no   
other major roads in Stoke-on-Trent, so
the D road was a breakthrough. To Mrs. 
Nichols herself the D-road had no      
effect on her life. It didn't help     
employment because there were people   
from another part of the country       
working on it. Another family moved    
because of the road's loud noise. So   
there were a lot of mixed opinions     
about the D Road.                      
The D Road was named Queensway to mark 
the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth  
II.                                    </content>
