		<title>09Porter's Mill</title>
		<content> Originally named Tapenhall and built  
 in AD 957, it was the porperty of the 
 Priory of Worcester. It stands on     
 the River Salwarpe and the disused    
 Droitwich Canal runs nearby.          
 The Porter family owned it from AD    
 1290 until 1709.                      
 It was rebuilt in 1861 and was        
 converted into a dwelling house in    
 1983. The old mill wheel and pulley   
 equipment remain intact. In converting
 the Mill, it has been extended to     
 twice its pre - 1983 size. The        
 exterior retains the plain            
 brickwork and small lead paned        
 windows. The interior is wood panelled
 throughout and it comfortably         
 furnished in an open plan style . The 
 present owners, Dr. Higginson and     
 family plan to restore the old mill   
 equipment.                            
                                       </content>
