		<content> The Mid-Devon,dating from c.1790,     
 hunts over this area and has many     
 supporters - hound puppies are        
 "walked" in the summer months. Riding 
 is very popular and the owner of Lower
 Nattadon races his horses at Newton   
 Abbott and elsewhere. Waye Barton has 
 been established as an equestrian     
 centre during the last two years.     
 Farmers at Batworthy,Buda,Lingcombe   
 and Shapley all shoot, chiefly pigeons
 and rabbits, also fish for trout and  
 salmon. Golf is popular with the young
 and at Middlecott a retired farmer has
 laid out a two acre practice field. At
 Beetor Farm there is an 11 acre motor 
 cycle scrambling course. Other outdoor
 hobbies include bee-keeping and sheep 
 showing. At weekends hang gliding and 
 model aeroplane flying are popular    
 with visitors to Meldon and Nattadon.
