		<title>05FARMING ON THE DOWNS</title>
		<content> Five farmers work this downland area. 
 The 1842 tithe map shows the same     
 field boundaries, and at that time    
 there was considerable arable land.   
 Today the Mossops of Rathfinny farm   
 600 acres in an east to west strip    
 from the Alfriston Road to the fields 
 known as Hobbs Hawth at the foot of   
 Blackstone Hill.  They rotate cereal  
 crops and have their own machinery for
 drilling and harvesting.  Mr Lewis of 
 Berwick Court works arable crops on   
 the land bordering the South Downs    
 Way, again using his own machinery and
 men.  Mr. Hecks of Ripe abuts his land
 on these farms and Mr. White's of     
 Bishopstone, having taken over 1000   
 acres, all arable, from the Firle     
 Estate.  Other fields are let out for 
 grazing.  New tractors cost Â£20,000.
