		<title>16Cropwell Bishop,The Cobbler</title>
		<content> In Cropwell Bishop we have a cobbler  
 and a sweet shop all in one, but very 
 recently the cobbler,{Tom Barrett,}   
 owner of the sweet shop, very sadly   
 died on the{7th of April, 1985.}He    
 wanted to carry on with his work until
 he was{100 years old,}but only made it
 to{91.}He was buried on his           
{ninety-second birthday} June 13th in  
 Cropwell Bishop Church's Cemetery. It 
 is said that Tom Barrett died of a    
 stroke.                               
   Mr. Barrett's shop was knocked down 
 on the 4th of June as it is said that 
 there is a well underneath it.Now they
 are planning to re- open it.          
   There is now nothing left to remind 
 us of him except memories and         
 photographs.
