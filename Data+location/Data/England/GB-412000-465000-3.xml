		<title>03Stuart and Michael's Father</title>
		<content>  Stuart and Michael's father is a     
 painter and decorator around Pateley. 
 On Tuesday, 18th June, he got up at   
 7.30am. As usual, he did not have any 
 breakfast. At 8.00am he left for work.
 He then went around to his workshop in
 Millfield Street, where he collected  
 his painting materials. He then went  
 to Smelthouses, near Pateley, in his  
 car. He was to decorate some rooms in 
 a house there. His first task was to  
 paint the ceiling of the kitchen. When
 that had dried, he gave it another    
 coat of paint. After that, he painted 
 the kitchen walls. When he had        
 finished, he ate his packed lunch.    
 Next he painted a large hall ceiling  
 and when he had finished that job, he 
 cleaned up his paint brushes and      
 gathered up his dustsheets. He came   
 home at about 5.00pm for his tea.
