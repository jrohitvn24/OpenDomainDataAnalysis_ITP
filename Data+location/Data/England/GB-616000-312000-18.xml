		<title>18POPULATION CHANGE,DRAYTON.</title>
		<content>    In recent years Drayton and        
 Taverham have been at the centre of a 
{significant change in the population  
 of East Anglia.People have moved to   
 the area for a variety of reasons and 
 from a variey of places.Most had moved
 from other parts of Norfolk,some      
 moving as they preferred a more rural 
 setting,some for family reasons and   
 the majority moving to be nearer their
 jobs in{Norwich.}Whilst being within  
 easy reach of Norwich,this area is    
 also conveniently close to the        
{airport,}the{oil and gas rigs}in the  
 North Sea and the{R.A.F. stations}that
 proliferate in this part of the       
 country.Most of the newcomers are in  
 management of one sort or another,    
 which reflects not only the mobility  
 of the middle classes but also the    
 trend in economic growth which is     
 centred around service industries.    </content>
