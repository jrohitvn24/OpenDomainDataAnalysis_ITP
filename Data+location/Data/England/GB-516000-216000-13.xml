		<content> There are very many different         
 organizations that people belong to.  
 Several of these are connected with   
 farming and the countryside, for      
 example, The National Farmers' Union. 
 There is also a wide variety of       
 occupations ranging from owning an    
 Interior Design School in London to   
 farming at home.Most people who live  
 in the area do not work in the        
 village.Many of them travel to near by
 towns or commute to London.Quite a few
 people take part in the leisure       
 activites of craft,ceramics,music,art 
 and drama.Gardening,walking and       
 fishing are also popular. There is no 
 gas in the village so most people use 
 solid fuel or oil for central heating 
 and electricity for cooking. As houses
 are very old, few have double glazing.
