		<title>11CHILDREN'S LEISURE TIME</title>
		<content>     We  did a survey of children's    
 playing time in our village. Most of  
 them play either near their own house 
 or in a friend's house.               
     Lots of children play with toys.  
 some of their favourite toys are      
{skipping ropes, bikes, computers and  
{Connect 4,}a game where you drop      
 counters  into slots, four in a row   
 wins. Nearly all the children watch   
 television  and over half the children
 have a video machine. Favourite       
 programes are{Dr.Who},about a man who 
 goes back and foward in a time        
 machine,{cartoons, Knight Rider}a man 
 who captures law breakers using  his  
 computerised car and{Grange hill}is a 
 story about a Comprehensive school.   
    Children  go out the village to the
 Hudson sports centre for swimming and 
 roller skating.
