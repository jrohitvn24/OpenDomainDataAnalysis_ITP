		<title>15THE GLYNDE LOCAL HISTORIAN</title>
		<content> The local historian was born in Firle,
 but moved to Glynde as a child, when  
 his parents took over the village     
 shop. Although most of the houses in  
 the village belong to the Glynde      
 estates, he owns his. He has made a   
 collection of old photographs and     
 postcards. The houses have changed    
 little, but the photographs of people 
 showed how differently people dress   
 now from the time before the 1st World
 War. A photograph of the school       
 children included a little girl who   
 is now the oldest person in the       
 village. He told us that Glynde was   
 once famous for the School of Lady    
 Gardeners at Ragged Lands and for its 
 creameries, a dairy which has now     
 become a bottle recycling plant.
