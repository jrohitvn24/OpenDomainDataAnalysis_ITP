		<title>14Hedges and Trees.</title>
		<content> Hedges between fields are disappearing
 except mainly as farm boundaries,     
 replaced by wire fencing, often       
 electrical, for livestock. Laneside   
 hedges survive. Most are closely      
 trimmed annually between July and     
 October. This year most trimming has  
 been done by mid-August and           
 blackberries and later wildflowers    
 destroyed. Field hedges around 404309 
 have grown untrimmed with many        
 standard trees developing. Some       
 standards persist in fields, relics of
 removed hedges. Some saplings have    
 been tagged in hedges (notably along  
 lane 404308 to Kenwick Farm, and along
 lane at 437l7 - these are mainly      
 Ash.)Ellesmere Road (427300-4l73300   
 hedges have several Elm standards,    
 many dying of Dutch Elm disease. There
 are also Oak and Lime standards.
