		<content>WICKHAMBROOK has a Parish Council with 
seven Councillors and a part-time      
Clerk. PC Meetings are held in the     
Church Room every 6 or 7 weeks. Public 
attendance at PC Meetings or at the    
Annual Parish Meeting for all (987)    
electors is tiny, unless a             
controversial issue is to be discussed.
The penny rate product is about #930.  
The PC is responsible for burials,     
footpaths (47 in W'brook), vets        
planning applications, advises District
and County Councils on local needs.    
COWLINGE also has a P.C. but DENSTON   
is not big enough and has only an      
annual Parish Meeting.
