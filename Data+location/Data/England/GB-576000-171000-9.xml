		<title>09Agriculture In Hoo.</title>
		<content> Owing to increasing mechanisation on  
 the farm in recent decades although   
 agriculture dominates the landscape   
 around the village very few people are
 permanently employed in this sector.  
 As a generalisation the relatively    
 mild coastal climate,and the lighter  
 soils in places,along with the        
 proxmity to major urban areas tends to
 favour{market gardening.}Some seasonal
 work at harvest time is therefore     
 available for the villagers.The A2(M) 
 has improved the link to London but   
 the traditional use of New Covent     
 Garden}Market as an outlet is being   
 broken. For the large farms there is a
 tendency to sell produce on contract  
 direct to large supermarket chains,and
{PYO}and{farmshops}are proving to be   
 increasingly popular.
