		<content> for pudding chocolate sponge and      
 custard.  After lunch we have another 
 playtime.  We go up on our gardens and
 pull out the weeds.  Then at 1.15     
 p.m. we go back to our class, we do   
 some more Mathematics and then some   
 of our topic.  Mr. Dunn reads us some 
 of the book the Demon Headmaster. The 
 bell rings again at 3.30 p.m.  At 3.30
 p.m. Mum collects me from school.  I  
 go home and clean my pony's stable    
 out, then I take my dog Ben for a walk
 across the fields.  At 4.45p.m. I get 
 my pony in from the field and groom   
 him.  When Dad comes home from work   
 he takes me out on a ride on Jumbo,   
 he rides his postman's bike.  When we 
 come home Mum makes some tea for      
 my sister Lisa and my Dad and myself. 
 After tea I watch TV for a while then 
 I go to bed at 9 p.m.
