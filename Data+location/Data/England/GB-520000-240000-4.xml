		<title>04EMPLOYMENT AROUND HINXWORTH</title>
		<content> Not so long ago the majority of people
 who lived here also worked here either
 on the land or in the shops that used 
 to exist.With increasing mechanisation
 those so employed dwindled drastically
 and thus those now living in the      
 village are mostly professionals      
 working outside the immediate area.The
 few who do work here tend to be self- 
 employed owing to the unemployment    
 situation or because it suits them to 
 work from home.These are mostly people
 involved in the arts in some way -    
 local craftsmen,artists,sculptors,    
 musicians; or builders,farm managers  
 and workers. The community is not yet 
 too affected by the unemployment in   
 the rest of the country; but there is 
 no industry and local traders find    
 life harder every year. Hence this is 
 a commuter zone with more than 60%    
 working in excess of 5 miles away.    </content>
