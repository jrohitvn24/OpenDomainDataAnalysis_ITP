		<content>    We visited the East Anglian Daily  
Times and spoke to Mr.Cocksedge,the    
manager.We asked him what the main     
headlines were this year. They are:    
         A 3 million pounds leisure    
     pool to be built.                 
         A 1 million pounds Eastern    
by-pass to be built. It will be 1 mile 
long and will take through traffic from
Sudbury.                               
         The sewers are in danger of   
collapsing under the weight of our     
waste.                                 
         Sudbury Rugby Club had a fire 
which destroyed the clubhouse causing  
damage costing 10,000 pounds.          
         The building of Lavenham      
church, 500yrs ago is being celebrated 
by the Spryngs family.
