		<title>04MONTFORD BRIDGE - NOISE</title>
		<content> Noise pollution is regarded as a major
 problem by many of the locals.        
                                       
 The heavy{road traffic}which passes   
 through the area on the A5 creates a  
 lot of noise for much of the day.     
 Discussions are presently under       
 way on the construction of a new      
 Shrewsbury by_pass which should help  
 to remedy this problem. The new road  
 is planned to divert the majority of  
 the traffic 600 metres from Montford  
 Bridge.                               
                                       
 Light{aircraft}used by parachutists   
 from the nearby Forton airfield create
 a lot of noise.  This has caused      
 considerable conflict with the local  
 people.  Further details on pages
