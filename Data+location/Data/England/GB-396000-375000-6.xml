		<content>   The primary occupation of the hill  
 farmer is breeding and rearing sheep  
 for the meat market.The flock,in      
 summer,consists of between one hundred
 and fifty and two hundred animals,    
 including the new lambs.To support    
 such numbers,the poor upland soil has 
 to be regularly fertilised and spread 
 with manure.Generally,a farmer keeps  
 his own rams_approximately six are    
 maintained.Every so often he will sell
 an individual ram and introduce an    
 outsider into the group so as to avoid
 inbreeding and its consequent diseases
 and disabilities.The ewes are covered 
 in three groups during the months of  
 October and November.This enables some
 lambs to be born in mid-March,some in 
 mid-April and the rest in late April. 
 By doing this all the lambing work    
 does not fall at once.
