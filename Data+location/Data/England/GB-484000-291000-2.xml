		<content>                                       
The village of Rockingham is situated  
at the bottom of the very steep        
Rockingham Hill.It is overshadowed by  
the castle pearched at the top of the  
hill. The village is very small and is 
streched along the main road. The      
houses are all very old and stone built
some still retaining thiet origonal    
thatch roofs. There is one pub and one 
small general store.Most of the people 
in the village work on the farms or    
else in Corby.Life is very quiet here.
