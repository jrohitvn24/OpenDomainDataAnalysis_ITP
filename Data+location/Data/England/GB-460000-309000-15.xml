		<content>    We have{choir}on Tuesdays, after   
 school and we work hard. We went to   
 the Derby Schools Music Festival with 
 the top recorder group. More than 300 
 children were there. We came second   
 and got a shield. We had a good time. 
                                       
    Every Tuesday, after choir, there  
 is{Gym club.}A good gymnast comes to  
 take it. We always start by warming up
 with forward and backward rolls and   
 hand- or head-stands. Then we get out 
 the rest of the mats and the box. We  
 do hand- and neck-springs. Sometimes  
 we use the springboard. At the end of 
 term we do tests to earn badges.      
                                       
    Other school clubs are:{art club,  
{guitars, computers, football, netball}
 and {rounders. }
