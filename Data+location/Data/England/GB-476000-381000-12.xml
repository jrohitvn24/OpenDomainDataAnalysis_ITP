		<content>{MEDIA }Television  is now standard in 
 homes, many have more than one set    
 and children have their own. Videos   
 are in 60% of homes and Radios with   
 audio recorders and record players are
 in most homes. Computers are owned by 
 40% but are used for games generally. 
 Local news papers give but scant      
 coverage and Leverton being on the    
 edge of a number of areas, we do not  
 rate media interest . A Magazine has  
 been published by the church for years
 and the school has done so for 25     
 years, using  stories and accounts of 
 school visits during the year. The    
 magazine is duplicated and sold in the
 village. Mobile library service visit 
 the area every two weeks and more     
 during school holidays. School hold a 
 library collection.
