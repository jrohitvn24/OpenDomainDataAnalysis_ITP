		<content>{Yaxley}has a population of about six  
 thousand and obviously an enormous    
 number of these were born outside the 
 village.In our survey we took a cross 
 section of the village,so that we     
 interviewed people from several       
 different estates built over the past 
 20 years as well as the older parts of
 the village like Broadway and Chapel  
 St. and of course Main St. which has  
 houses going back to the 17th century.
 we also tried to get some of the small
 fen farmers into our survey.          
  We found that a little more than half
 of the people interviewed were not    
 born in the village but had moved into
 it from over areas for a variety of   
 reasons e.g.convenience for work in   
 Peterborough,the A1 is only a mile    
 from the village,also houses are      
 comparatively cheap.
