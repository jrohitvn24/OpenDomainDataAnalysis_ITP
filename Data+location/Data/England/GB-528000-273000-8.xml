		<content>  Most people in North St.Ives like    
 sports. Even though there are no      
 actual facilities  in our D Block,    
 there are two sports centres within   
 walking distance.The Ivo School is one
 of the centres.At the Ivo there is    
 swimming,tennis ,squash,weightlifting,
 badminton,bowling,golf,rollerskating  
 dancing,shooting,netball and          
 football.The outdoor complex          
 consists of a track,which is a quarter
 of a mile,and four or five squash     
 courts. Also when you have worked hard
 you can go under the shower.Even      
 though most people go to the          
 recreation  ground, some people do go 
 to the inside complex.Generally the   
 people of our area are very fortunate 
 as they can play most sports on their 
 own doorstep.
