		<title>09Ashbourne Industrial Estate.</title>
		<content> At the southern edge of Ashbourne is  
 a high plateau. This was used as an   
 airfield during World War II but this 
 is now largely overgrown and the land 
 given over to{farming.}Barley is grown
 here and grass for hay and silage.    
 There is also some rough grazing for a
 herd of sheep.At the eastern edge of  
 the airfield adjoining the  Derby Road
 is a small{industrial estate.}This    
 contains a variety of manufacturing   
 and commercial units,including a small
 brick and tile maker, an agricultural 
 feed merchant, a supplier of tyres and
 exhausts and a firm re-cycling rubber.
 In a survey we found that only        
 fourteen pupils had parents who worked
 on the industrial estate.This suggests
 that it is{not a major employer}of    
 local labour, most of it's workforce  
 coming from outside the area.
