		<title>18Farm Shop, Buckham Hill.</title>
		<content>   We initially set out to produce food
 for our own consumption but found that
 we had an excess which we were able to
 sell 'at our door'. We realised that  
 there was a demand for{organic}produce
 and the business expanded. In April   
 '84 we converted an out-building into 
 a shop. We can expect{600-700}custom- 
 ers a week in Summer but fewer in the 
 Winter as people are less prepared to 
 travel out into the country. Fridays &amp;
 Saturdays are busiest when we have 4  
 or 5 people working in the shop.      
   All meat produce comes from{local   
{farms}or our own: beef,pork &amp; bacon,  
 lamb,veal,guinea fowl &amp; geese. Dairy  
 produce includes: unpasteurised milk &amp;
 cream &amp; a wide range of cheeses. We   
 supply some vegetables, others come   
 from local growers or from Brighton   
 Market. We process the milk, cream,   
 pigs &amp; guinea fowl.                   </content>
