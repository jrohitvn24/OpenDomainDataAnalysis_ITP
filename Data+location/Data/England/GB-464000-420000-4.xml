		<title>04THE SEWING MISTRESS SAGA</title>
		<content>  The log books of Snaith Primary      
 School                                
 contain the following saga relating to
 the relationship between Jabez        
 Fieldhouse (Headteacher 1863) and his 
 sewing mistress.                      
{November 1863...}The girls are behind 
 the boys, especially in arithmetic.   
 They should not be judged by the same 
 standard.                             
{December 1863...}The sewing class     
 interferes with the organisation of   
 the school. The girls are behind the  
 rest of the class in attainments.     
{January 1864....}We have to unteach   
 what children know at the ladies      
 school. Great complaints have been    
 made with regard to the sewing class  
 conducted by Mrs Harrison.            
{February 1864...}Mrs Harrison paid    
 off. Mrs Fieldhouse agreeing to take  
 her place.                            </content>
