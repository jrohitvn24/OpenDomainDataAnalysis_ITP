		<title>03WILDLIFE IN WILLINGDON</title>
		<content>   The South Downs are close to their  
 eastern end here.                     
   The typical wildlife of chalk grass 
 land is abundant.                     
   One may enjoy basilthyme, cowslips, 
 stemless thistle,clumps of gorse and  
 hillsides of orchids.                 
   Butterflies include fritillaries,   
 the chalk-hill blue and the brimstone.
 There are adders, grass snakes and    
 slow worms.One can see swallows,      
 flocks of gold finches, skylarks,     
 magpies, kestrels and sparrowhawks.   
 Owls can be heard at night. Rabbits   
 seem to be recovering in numbers.     
 There are hares, moles,foxes and      
 badgers.                              
   When myxomatosis was introduced in  
 1954 the number of rabbits declined   
 and the grassland became overgrown.   
 Sheep have been introduced at Chalk   
 Farm to reverse this trend.           </content>
