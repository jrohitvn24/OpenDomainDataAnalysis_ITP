		<title>16LEOMINSTER FAMILY'S WEEKEND</title>
		<content> My normal weekend begins with mum     
 getting me out of bed on Saturday at  
 about half past eight. Soon I am      
 making my way to the Minster School   
 where I train as a member of the      
 Leominster and District Youth Club    
 Harriers.                             
 After athletics I go home and watch   
 Grandstand and World of Sport. During 
 the evening I sometimes play with my  
 snooker table, play cricket in the    
 garden or watch television.           
 I get up at about ten o'clock on      
 Sunday, read the newspaper and watch  
 my brother play football in the       
 morning. After dinner I change into my
 football kit to play football for     
 Luston under twelves where mum and dad
 come and watch me. After the match,   
 which we normally lose, we go home and
 my dad starts saying where we went    
 wrong.                                </content>
