		<content> Our survey showed that about half of  
 the children have one or both sets of 
 grandparents living within a twenty   
 mile radius of Southminster.Many of   
 these live near London in Romford or  
 Ilford, which bears out the fact      
 that there has been a migration from  
 the city in recent years. There are   
 still some old Southminster families  
 with names like Hurrell, Stammers and 
 Harvey.                               
 There was a rapid expansion in the    
 population in the 1960's, resulting in
 an imbalance in the age structure so  
 that there are now high numbers of    
 school leavers.The numbers of primary 
 school aged children fell to 160 in   
 1983 but is gradually rising again    
 now.
