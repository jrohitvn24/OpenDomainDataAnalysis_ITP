		<content> Next to the main road runs a small    
 single track{railway line}which       
 connects{Ludgershall}to the main      
{London-Exeter}line near{Andover.} A   
 very large network of lines were laid 
 in the second half of the nineteenth  
 century which brought growth and      
 prosperity to many towns and villages.
                                       
 In the early nineteen-sixties the     
 lines were severely cut back because  
 of the cost of running them and the   
 railways left are still working at    
 great expense.  The line in this block
 used to be part of the passenger      
 network but now is used to carry      
 freight for the{Defence Department}to 
{Tidworth.                             
                                       
 Much of the goods which used to be    
 carried by train now have to be taken 
 by road on lorries.                   </content>
