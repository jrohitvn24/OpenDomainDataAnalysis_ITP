 Westbury All Saints Church was        
 completed around the year 1340 with a 
 Saxon and a Norman church existing on 
 the site prior to this.  There is a   
 fine tower with walls four feet thick,
 inside which are the 107 steps which  
 lead to the roof.  In the tower are   
 the third heaviest set of bells in the
 world, which are set on three separate
 axes in order to prevent the tower    
 from collapsing when they are rung.   
 The chimes are regulated by the 281-  
 year- old clock, which is maintained  
 daily by Mr.Bradley, a local train    
 driver.  Above the South Porch is     
 carved a sundial dating from 1821. It 
 is one of the largest in the country  
 and has an inscription which reads:   
 "Like to the Hour of the Day, our Time
 and Life soon pass away."
