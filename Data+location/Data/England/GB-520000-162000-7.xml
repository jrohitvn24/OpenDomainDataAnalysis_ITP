		<title>07HOMES IN WEST EWELL</title>
		<content> In the Riverview area of West Ewell in
 the year 1985,most of our children    
 live in houses. Most of these houses  
 are joined into a terrace,or          
 semi-detached and made of brick. The  
 roofs are ridged and made of tiles.The
 majority of the houses were built     
 forty to fifty years ago, and quite a 
 few are around fifteen years old, at  
 which time a large number of council  
 houses were built on an estate behind 
 the school.All the houses have their  
 own gardens.Including the             
 lavatory,most houses have eight or    
 nine rooms depending on whether they  
 have two or three bedrooms, or whether
 they have a "through lounge" or a     
 separate dining room.About half the   
 children have their own bedroom.Most  
 of the houses have central heating.
