 except for ambulance charters.10 days 
 of flying are lost a year because of  
 fog or low cloud.The height ofthe     
 runway is 291ft and the length of the 
 runway is 2887ft.                     
  1985 is the 50th anniversary of the  
 foundation of the airport.It was the  
 first commercial airport in the       
 Channel Isles(Before this planes used 
 to land on the beach).To commemorate  
 this an air rally was held in the     
 summer and was very successful being  
 attended by about 100 private         
 aircraft.                             
  The airport is used by other         
 commercial airlines,private pilots    
 ,the services and charter flights.It  
 is a vital lifeline for the island    
 even though it is expensive to run.
