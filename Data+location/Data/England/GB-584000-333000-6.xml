		<content> Livestock features permanently on only
 two farms.  One has sheep, the pigs   
 and both have suckler cows for beef   
 production.  These utilize some       
 permanent pasture (one meadow being an
 historic site), some areas of light   
 land and water meadows.  One of the   
 larger farms owned by a company only  
 diversifies into beef production when 
 the trade is profitable.  Livestock   
 makes extra demands upon the labour   
 force and the wages bill unless the   
 farmer himself is prepared to be      
 stockman during weekends, nights and  
 holidays.  In consequence the large   
 farms prefer the more comfortable     
 arable farming on their acres.  The   
 sheep are sold at local markets and   
 the pigs to a national supermarket    
 chain.
