		<content>  Wareham Job Centre is run by Mr.Imms.
 He manages both Wareham and Swanage   
 Job Centres.Dorset's main office is   
 in Poole.Its provides a service to    
 residents,but in the summer helps many
 from other areas.Wareham has the      
 highest amount of jobs,except in      
 summer when Swanage employs many part 
 time people,to cater for the large    
 number of tourists.The main group of  
 jobs that aren't filled are part time 
 jobs,because people looking for jobs, 
 want a steady wage.In the Job Centre  
 they have an average of 3-4 jobs      
 filled a day.Most people who have just
 left school don't use the Job Centre  
 but are reffered to the town careers. 
 The main jobs that people in the area 
 get are industrial jobs and trades,   
 clerical,retail and catering          
 jobs.
