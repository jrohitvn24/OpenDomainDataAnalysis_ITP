		<title>19OUR FAMILY WEEKEND</title>
		<content> We have visitors on Saturdays and so  
 we do a lot of cooking.Sometimes we   
 visit Grandma and play tennis and     
 croquet in Saltwell Park.Trips to     
 Newcastle are rare as my dad hates    
 shopping.On a typical Sunday we stay  
 at home unless the weather is sunny.We
 aren't the kind for going to Church   
 but we still believe in God.My mam and
 dad do not like to sit around doing   
 nothing on a Sunday.We like fishing   
 and making models.Cooking is another  
 hobby.Sometimes we go camping in the  
 wilds of Scotland because we hate camp
 sites.We hardly watch T.V.Instead we  
 do handicrafts like sewing and        
 knitting.My mam went to art classes   
 and she likes painting.We like doing  
 our different hobbies.We enjoy them   
 more than anything else.
