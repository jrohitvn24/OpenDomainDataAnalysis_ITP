		<title>08Faldingworth Village Shop</title>
		<content>   There is only one shop in           
{Faldingworth.}It is a post office and 
 a general store selling groceries,    
 fruit, vegetables, sweets, newspapers 
 and magazines. The owners are Mr &amp; Mrs
 Northing. The building is over a      
 hundred years old and has been altered
 several times in it's history. The    
 shop forms the front of the ground    
 floor and the owners live in rooms    
 behind and above the shop.            
   The shop serves the local community 
 and a large country area, the nearest 
 other shops being at the{Virginia     
{Estate, Middle Rasen}and{Dunholme,}all
 at least three miles away.            
   Years ago Mr Richardson had the     
 shop, when a number of items e.g.     
 flour, tea, sugar, butter, lard and   
 salt which are now pre-packaged were  
 delivered in bulk and had to be       
 weighed into small packages.          </content>
