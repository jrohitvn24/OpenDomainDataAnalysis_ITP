 the week at around 7.15 or 7.30am.    
 Nearly all childen arrive at school at
 8.30 for the whistle at 8.50.         
    After school,which finishes at     
 3.15, most children go home and watch 
 television.After this,many go to      
 Guides,Brownies,Scouts or Cubs.       
    A few of the children have music   
 lessons learning such instruments as  
 the piano or the violin.The third year
 children who were asked mostly seem to
 go to bed at around 8.30 or even 9.00 
 in some cases.                        
    Some of the children do other      
 things like playing badminton,go to   
 majorettes,gym club or a swimminng    
 club or go horse riding.              
    In general,though,most of the      
 children spend their time watching    
 television in the afternoon and       
 evening.                              </content>
