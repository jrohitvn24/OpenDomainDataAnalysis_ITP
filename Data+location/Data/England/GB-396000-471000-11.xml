		<title>11EARLY HISTORY OF KETTLEWELL</title>
		<content>   People have lived in Wharfedale     
 since the Bronze Age. In the 8th      
 Century Anglian farmers settled here, 
 calling it "Cetel Wella", a bubbling  
 spring, or stream.                    
   Mediaeval Kettlewell had a fine     
 market, with a charter in 1320.  The  
 surrounding area was owned by the     
 monasteries and managed as vast sheep 
 estates.  Livestock was sold at the   
 weekly market and Autumn fair.        
   In the 16th and 17th Centuries the  
 farmers became freeholders or yeomen  
 with new wealth to rebuild farm       
 houses, still in use today.  From     
 1800, leadmining grew in importance,  
 with hundreds of tons of lead ore     
 mined at Dowber Gill and smelted in   
 the village. Smaller cottages were    
 built to house miners and their       
 families. Lime kilns were built in the
 18th Centuries.                       </content>
