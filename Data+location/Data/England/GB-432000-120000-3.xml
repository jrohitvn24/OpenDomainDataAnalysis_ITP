		<title>03OLDER HOUSES IN ROMSEY</title>
		<content> A few of the houses in the villages   
 are very old.  My own house is over   
 200 years old and it was made out of  
 oak wood beams, mud, clay, flint,     
 stones.  First oak beams were banged  
 into the ground to make a frame, then 
 a clay layer was put over the mud.    
 This was done in the summer, so the   
 clay dried quickly and became         
 waterproof then for a year the mud    
 dried more slowly which then made the 
 walls rock hard.  My house is thatched
 like a few more houses in our road.   
 My house, like many of today's old    
 homes, have been partly rebuilt in    
 some places.  Old walls have been     
 knocked down and then bricked up using
 modern bricks so they last longer.    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
