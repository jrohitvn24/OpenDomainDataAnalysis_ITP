  Rapidly becoming overgrown by the    
forest lies the site of Fair Oak       
Colliery. Beneath the undergrowth can  
be found the top of the shafts as well 
as the remains of the circular powder  
house which stood beside the           
Stonybrook Pool that provided water    
for the pit.                           
  A company was formed in 1871 which   
sank two shafts. Number one shaft was  
abandoned in 1875 without finding      
workable seams. In April 1876 coal was 
found at number two shaft but          
underground flooding and the           
depression in coal mining led to its   
closure in the 1880Â£s.                 
  The routes of the old tramway and    
railway that served the colliery now   
serve as paths for walkers on the      
Chase.
