 distance to see the castle but there  
 is no castle.{The population is}about 
 three and a half thousand ,most of    
 which don't work here but go to work  
 in{Portsmouth, Southampton}and even   
 some in{London}. Lots of people work  
 at{IBM}the computer people.Also some  
 people are naval captains. Quite a lot
 of retired people come here for their 
 last years.                           
 Rowlands Castle used to be a farming  
 community but in the last{twenty      
{years}it has grown up with all the    
 houses.Rowlands Castle used to be busy
 and lots of houses used to be         
 shops.There are about{7 shops}in      
 Rowlands Castle.The people of Rowlands
 Castle would not like neighbouring{   
{Leigh Park estate}to overlap them.
