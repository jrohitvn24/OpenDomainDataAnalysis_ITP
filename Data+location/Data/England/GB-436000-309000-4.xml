		<title>04Coal Mining</title>
		<content> Each dragline cost four million pounds
 to buy and two million pounds to put  
 together.  Altogether there are 165   
 people working at the mine.   Once the
 coal has been dug up, it has to be    
 screened and then it travels by train 
 to the power station.  The coal-miners
 start work at 7 o'clock and finish at 
 6 o'clock.  When we started mining    
 here five years ago, the men had to   
 put a big fence round the site.  Then 
 the big scrapers had to move about 30 
 cm of top soil, followed by the       
 subsoil.  The two draglines are used  
 to help move the soil.  The coal is   
 taken by big lorries to the train.    
 After all the coal is taken out of the
 site, it will be restored and used for
 farming.
