 was built by Richard Hartshorne in    
 1721 on land that belonged to the{Duke
{of Sutherland.}Most of the land in    
 this area belonged to the Duke of     
 Sutherland. It was a mining area and  
 most of the old mine shafts can still 
 be seen.

 is supposed to be haunted by Hannah   
 who was the daughter of Abraham Darby 
 II.

 glass,steel and tar. Later he built a 
 laboratory at Bank House.             </content>
