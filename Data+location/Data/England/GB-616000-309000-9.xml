 There is a rich seam of sand and      
 gravel deposits beneath Costessey and 
 Bowthorpe.  Atlas Aggregates, a part  
 of the RMC group, are involved in     
 opencast quarrying of these deposits. 
 The main pit area is to the west of   
 Old Costessey.  Another large area is 
 being exploited to the south of the   
 new Bowthorpe development.  This is in
 conjunction with Anglian Water, who   
 intend to move the river when the     
 final reinstatement of the excavated  
 area is carried out.                  
 Costessey pits (the area which has    
 been finished with) is used for water 
 skiing.  Anglian Water would like to  
 establish an emergency water reserve  
 for the city of Norwich.  Another part
 is being used to dump refuse.
