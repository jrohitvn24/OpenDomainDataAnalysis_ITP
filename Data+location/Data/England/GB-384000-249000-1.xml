   In the first Domesday Survey in     
 1086,Kempsey had 24 hides of land and 
 2 ploughs. There were 15 farm servants
 and 27 farm servants of the lowest    
 rank. The other residents were one    
 priest, four serfs and two serving    
 women; the total population was about 
{210.}There were 40 acres of meadow    
 and a wood a mile long and half a mile
 wide, but no mention of fishponds or  
 windmills.                            
   The census figure of 2,925 from 1981
 has risen to{3000}with the opening of 
 estates at Kings Hill and Plovers     
 Rise. Compared to the survey in 1086, 
 the amount of land actually designated
 as being part of Kempsey has increased
 and more machinery is used in         
 agriculture. Today Kempsey is         
 considered as one of England's largest
 villages.                             </content>
