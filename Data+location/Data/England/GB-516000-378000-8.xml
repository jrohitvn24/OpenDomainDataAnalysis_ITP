		<title>08FARMING METHODS IN PANTON</title>
		<content> All the {PANTON}farms follow modern   
 farming methods and due to the heavy  
 nature of the soil, most work is car- 
 ried on during the months of September
 and October following the harvesting  
 period. Tractors are mainly in the lOO
 to l5O h.p. range and the implements  
 they pull are often 2O-3O ft in width.
 No natural manures are used on the    
 fields of{PANTON}today due to the lack
 of grazing animals kept locally so    
 artificial fertilisers containing     
 phosphates, potash and nitrogen are   
 spread on the land. Crop spraying is  
 either carried out by tractor-drawn   
 sprayer or aeroplanes from Wickenby.  
 Spraying is carried out for weed      
 killing, aphid control, disease       
 control or for feeding trace elements 
 suh as manganese, magnesium, natural  
 sulphur.  Non-farming residents are   
 alarmed about other effects of sprays.</content>
