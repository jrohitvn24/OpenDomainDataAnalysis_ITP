		<title>18FARMING IN THE AREA</title>
		<content> The farming in this area is mostly    
 arable,the main crops are wheat,barley
 and oil-seed rape.These crops need    
 plenty of rain.The farmer at Hadston  
 grows these,and at harvest time he    
 hires a combine harvester.            
 The farm also has 350 cattle,150 are  
 dairy cattle,the other 200 are young  
 cattle,some of which will be killed   
 for meat.Apart from the milking       
 parlour he is not highly mechanised.  
 The farm is made up of old            
 buildings,but recently they have built
  a new shed for their 150 dairy       
 cattle.They have also built a slurry  
 pit for the waste from the cattle     
 which will be spread over the fields  
 in the autumn to help the grass grow  
 for the hay crop next year.
