		<title>07HONDA COMES TO SOUTH MARSTON</title>
		<content> Our area has had strong associations  
 with the motor industry since the     
 1950s when the Austin Rover car body  
 plant (see page 6) was established. In
 1985 a new development was announced  
 which is certain to increase our      
 association with the industry. The    
 Japanese car company{Honda}purchased a
 large industrial site at South        
 Marston.                              
 A pre-delivery test centre and parts  
 warehouse are to be completed by      
 mid-1986. An 8000 square metre car    
 reception building, including offices,
 and a second major building serving as
 the parts warehouse are under         
 construction. 200 jobs will be created
 in this first phase but it is hoped   
 that up to 2000 jobs could be provided
 if proposals for vehicle and engine   
 assembly on the site are realised.
