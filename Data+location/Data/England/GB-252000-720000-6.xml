		<title>06ENTERTAINMENT IN BALQUHIDDER</title>
		<content> In Balquhidder the adults have quite a
 few different kinds of entertainment. 
 At varying times of the year there are
 dances and ceilidhs in the village    
 hall. In the winter, bowls are started
 and quite a few people in the glen go 
 to that. Sometimes there is a village 
 Fete and there is always a good       
 turnout. Another very popular winter  
 pastime is whist and both children and
 adults enjoy that. Quite a few        
 families in the glen are curlers and  
 some of them are skips and coaches.   
 This is a very good area for hill     
 walking and men and women both do a   
 lot of climbing. Some are members of  
 the mountain rescue team. After a hard
 day of work the men like to go to the 
 local hotel.                          
 There is also a well attended Country 
 Dancing class.                        
                                       </content>
