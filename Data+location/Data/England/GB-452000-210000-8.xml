		<content>  Elsfield was probably established as 
 a community since Anglo Saxon times.  
  John Buchan, Lord Tweedsmuir, a      
 Governor General of Canada and a      
 prolific author, lived in the Manor   
 House. His novel "Midwinter" opens    
 with a scene on nearby Otmoor.        
  Francis Wise, the antiquary, lived at
 the Manor House when he was librarian 
 at the Bodleian (1748_67) and was     
 visited there by Dr Johnson. In recent
 times a Professor of Japanese at      
 Oxford University lived in Woodeaton  
 and is buried in the churchyard.      
  Lower Woods farm is part Tudor, and  
 in the yard are two enormous oak trees
 which supposedly date back to the 16th
 century.                              
  Elsfield is derived from the         
 Anglo_Saxon meaning "The field of Ella
 or Elesa". Woodeaton means "The wood  
 by the meadows".                      </content>
