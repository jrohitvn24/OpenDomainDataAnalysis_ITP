		<title>10 TOURISM AROUND WOODBRIDGE</title>
		<content> Tourism in Woodbridge centres around  
the river and its effect on the town   
both past and present. In the past it  
was a port for barges carrying grain to
the Tide Mill (see p.2) and timber for 
ship building.                         
 Nowadays the marina welcomes yachts   
from Holland,Belgium and France as well
as yachtsmen from all around the coast.
There is a flourishing dinghy sailing  
club with many young members.          
 Most visitors to Woodbridge comment on
the narrow streets,timber framed houses
and curiosities from times past: The   
{Bell and Steelyard}, Market Hill with 
the old {Shire Hall},the {Seckford Alms
Houses}. These contrast with modern use
of the area: {Gobbits Yard},the {Turban
Shopping Centre} and many small shops  
in what used to be private houses.     
 If you walk down Market Hill to the   
river you will see the contrasts.      </content>
