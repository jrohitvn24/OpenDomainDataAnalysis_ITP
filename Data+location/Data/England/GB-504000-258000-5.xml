		<content> The population of Thurleigh is        
 approximately 615 people. It is a very
 well balanced population, with 131    
 schoolchildren and 93 people of       
 pensionable age.The oldest occupants  
 of the area are a lady of 95 and a    
 gentleman of 92, who still works and  
 drives his car around the village.    
 The population is made up of 221      
 households. There are houses of all   
 descriptions in the village, to rent, 
 to buy and tied accommodation. A lot  
 of the council houses, in recent years
 been bought by their occupants. The   
 type of dwelling varies from Victorian
 farmhouses, thatched cottages,old     
 persons dwellings, modern houses and  
 even a block of flats.                
 The worry that the village has        
 regarding the future, however is that 
 housing is too costly for the young   
 local people to buy.                  </content>
