 At home I had beefburgers and chips   
 which I quickly ate before returning  
 to school.I played football until it  
 was time for afternoon school.        
   I read quietly for fifteen minutes  
 then class went out for games.We had  
 the choice of football or rounders.   
 Games lasted nearly an hour.We went in
 for our teacher to read us a story.A  
 few minutes to tidy the class then it 
 was 3.15 hometime.                    
  I raced home, took off my coat and   
 shoes  and was soon out to play again.
 Mom called me in for tea. I ate tea,  
 then played on my computer until it   
 was time for Scouts. I put on my scout
 uniform then went back to school for  
 8.00.Scouts included flagbreak, non-  
 stop cricket, a camp talk, prayers,   
 then flagdown at 9.30. home quickly   
 then a drink and bed for 10.30.       </content>
