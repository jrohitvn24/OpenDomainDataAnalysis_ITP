		<content> At present there is some debate going 
 on as to whether the Tarmac Company   
 should be allowed to develop more pits
 within the area. Many local residents 
 object to this, since they feel it    
 would spoil the predominantly rural   
 aspect of the village, and may        
 adversly affect property values. The  
 pits that have become exhausted have  
 flooded and vegitation has been       
 encouraged to grow around them. They  
 now form an attractive area with a    
 large recreational potential. A series
 of footpaths have been established    
 forming a number of very pleasant     
 walks around the pits and through the 
 fast growing trees and shrubs planted 
 as part of the naturalisation process.
 The pits themselves are used by       
 anglers and water sportsmen as well as
 forming a haven for wildlife and      
 birds.                                </content>
