<title>29A day in a life</title>
<content>

On Saturday I was due to have my first surfing lesson, it was cancelled due to strong winds.&lt;br />&lt;br /> Instead dad and I went to play golf. As there were not many people there, we were able to play 2 rounds. I beat him for the first time which I really enjoyed. After lunch we went to the cinema in Chichester and watched ‘Diary of a Wimpy Kid’, and it was very entertaining. &lt;br />&lt;br />When we got home dad cooked our dinner, then we watched television before it was time for bed.  &lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
