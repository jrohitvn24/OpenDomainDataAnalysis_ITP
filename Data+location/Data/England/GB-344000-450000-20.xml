		<title>20Employment in Cockerham</title>
		<content>  With the advent of new methods and   
 sophisticated machinery farming has   
 ceased to provide much employment in  
 this area. Most farming families      
 manage to operate with little or no   
 hired help.The use of machinery in    
 place of horses was one of the factors
 contributing to the closure of the    
 Smithy about 30 years ago.Crookhey    
 Hall,set in splendid grounds,is now a 
 School for boys with special needs.It 
 provides employment for a Headmaster,5
 teaching staff &amp; 26 ancillary workers,
 some part time.The Old Rectory Rest   
 Home has accomodation for 24 residents
 &amp; has 8 full time &amp; pt time employees.
 Joiner &amp; Undertaker,Electrician &amp;     
 Builder,Garage operation are tradesmen
 in the area but they tend  to be a 1  
 or 2 man business. Other people find  
 employment in Lancaster,Garstang,     
 Preston or Lancaster University.      </content>
