		<title>06WHAT WE LIKE TO WEAR</title>
		<content>Most children in our class at Bliss    
Charity School like to wear fashionable
clothes. Most girls shop at "C &amp; A" &amp;  
"Tammy Girl". Just about all the boys  
shop at "Burtons" &amp; "C &amp; A". I like to 
wear trendy clothes and I get my       
clothes from "Chelsea Girl" &amp; "Tammy   
Girl". In the fashion at the moment are
flowered tops, long skirts and baggies.
A couple of people don't like          
fashionable clothes because they think 
that they are too common. If you want  
to be in fashion for jewellery it is   
best to have dangling earrings and     
tight necklaces. If you go into "Tammy 
Girl" and buy a suit you will most     
probably be given a necklace with it.  
Not a lot of people like the uniform   
that they will have to wear next term  
at their comprehensive school, Campion 
School,Bugbrooke. At this school we do 
not have to wear uniform.              </content>
