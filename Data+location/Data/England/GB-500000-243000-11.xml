		<content> The{population}of the village was     
 fairly constant at around 1200 for    
 most of the last century and the first
 half of this, but it has increased    
 dramatically since the 1960's, topping
 3000 by 1981 and over 4000 at the time
 of writing. This change is due to the 
 large amount of house-building during 
 this period.                          
 The most impressive{building}in the   
 village besides St.Mary's Church is   
 Wootton House. Built in the late 17th 
 century for the Monoux family, the two
 storey building of red brick (later   
 plastered) is now privately owned.    
 There are several 17th, 18th and 19th 
 century cottages remaining in the     
 village although many of them have    
 been much altered.
