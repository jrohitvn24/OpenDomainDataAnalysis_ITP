		<title>04SPROTBROUGH LIBRARY</title>
		<content>  We were shown around by Mr.Mackay,  a
 fully qualified Librarian. Born in    
 1952,went to college for a degree,then
 qualified. He hasn't had any other    
 occupation.To become a Librarian you  
 have to have good marks in your exams.
  Mr.Mackay showed us around first we  
 went upstairs. There were newspapers  
 and magazines for people to read,     
 tables and chairs for us to do our    
 homework There were old reference     
 books which are not to be borrowed    
 unless you need them badly.We looked  
 at the Record and Tape section.You    
 have to be fourteen to join. Not many 
 people came in whilst we were there.  
 The library is busiest on a Saturday  
 because children are not at           
 School.Three people work there on a   
 Saturday.The Library is a quiet place 
 and has been open for twelve years.
