		<title>01Essex NE coastal sea area</title>
		<content> This is a flat even landscape, made up
 of sea, sandbanks, saltmarshes and    
 some grassland. Here 2 large channels,
 Hamford Water &amp; Walton Channel enter  
 the sea. There is a sandbank,Pye Sand,
 an island called Stone Marsh &amp; the NE 
 tip of Horsey Island which is a larger
 island documented in the adjacent     
 square with the main farm. The shore- 
 line, being of soft sand and mud is   
 forever changing shape year by year.  
 The sea has already demolished a sea  
 wall built in 1962. This has not been 
 rebuilt so the sea has penetrated     
 still further inland. Besides the two 
 large channels already mentioned, the 
 sea makes inroads across the          
 saltmarshes, by small channels which  
 empty out at low tide, thus making it 
 possible to walk from the mainland of 
 Walton-on-the-Naze to the islands.
