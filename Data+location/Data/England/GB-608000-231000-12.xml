		<title>12Lawford School</title>
		<content> Lawford C of E school is big and      
 square. The doors and windows are very
 large with a few pictures stuck on to 
 them. It has 2 playing areas, one has 
 netball pitches and the other larger  
 area has a hump right in the middle of
 it. The school is surounded by a wire 
 fence, there is a long drive leading  
 to the main building. Inside the      
 school there is a dinner hall which we
 also  use for Gymnastics. The office  
 and the girls and boys changing rooms 
 lead off from the hall. There are     
 three infant classrooms, three junior 
 classrooms, a television room and a   
 mobile classroom.
