		<content>  This square is dominated by a hill   
 which gives a commanding view of the  
 surrounding countryside.              
                                       
  Addenbrookes Hospital can be clearly 
 seen, across a gently sloping field, a
 bit further down the hill, is a       
 beautifull cottage. This square       
 consists primarily of agricultural    
 land, with the occasional house.      
                                       
  At Caius College Farm there were     
 three main buildings. One was         
 derelict, while the other two were    
 still being lived in. It had one or   
 two barns and a lot of machinary.     
 There were also large areas of arable 
 land. Radishes and oil seed rape were 
 mainly grown.
