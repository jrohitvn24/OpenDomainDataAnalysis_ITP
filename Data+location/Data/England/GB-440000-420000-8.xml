		<content> At 7.15 I get out of bed,wake my      
 brother up and we both get dressed    
 then we go downstairs and put the     
 television on then I go into the      
 kitchen to make our breakfast,we      
 usually have cereal and a cup of tea, 
 we carry this into the room and eat it
 from our knee.At 8-30 we go upstairs  
 to wake Mum up and get washed and     
 brush our teeth before leaving for    
 school.We are in school from 9-00 to  
 3-30.After school my brother and I go 
 to the sweet shop on our bikes,then I 
 call for my friends and we play with  
 Barbie dolls or at ball.At 6-00 I have
 my tea,I usually have a cheese and    
 Branston pickle sandwich and a cup of 
 tea.I play out again until 7-30 when I
 have to get ready for bed before Kay  
 comes to look after us.At 8-00 my Mum 
 goes out and I play records with Kay  
 before going to bed about 10-00.      </content>
