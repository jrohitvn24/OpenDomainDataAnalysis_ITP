		<title>11The Boulevard,Stoke</title>
		<content>Between Boothen C.E. Primary and London
Road,Stoke there is a boulevard.The    
boulevard is a footpath lined on both  
sides with trees and grass and some    
flowers.There are also a few benches.  
Older people sit on them to chat with  
each other.Mums sometimes rest there on
the way back from shopping.            
  The proper name for the boulevard is 
Coronation Gardens.It is called that   
because it was opened in 1953,the year 
of the Queen's Coronation and cost 700 
pounds to construct.Coronation Gardens 
used to be the Newcastle canal. The    
canal was built in 1795-6 and it ran   
from the Trent and Mersey Canal.But    
the canal did not seem profitable and  
so in 1938 it was filled in.           
  The area of the boulevard is 2 1/4   
acres, and it is maintained by the     
Parks and Recreation Department.
