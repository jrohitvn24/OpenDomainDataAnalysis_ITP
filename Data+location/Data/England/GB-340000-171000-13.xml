		<title>13East Clevedon to Court Hill1</title>
		<content> On Wednesday 17th July,class 2 of     
 East Clevedon Primary School set out  
 on a survey walk from All Saints      
 Church through Court Wood to Court    
 Hill,overlooking the M5.              
 The wood is made up of mainly         
 deciduous trees with a thick ground   
 covering of ivy,ferns and bracken.    
 The walk took us along the back of    
 Clevedon Court.The family home of the 
 Eltons,it is now owned by the National
 Trust.It has fourteenth century       
 features including a chapel on the    
 first floor and a fine great hall.    
 The writer Thackeray stayed there     
 (when it was owned by Arthur Hallam)  
 and wrote part of "Vanity Fair"and    
 "Henry Esmond".                       
 Walking past Clevedon Court we came to
 "Queen Anne Cottage".It obviously     
 dates from the time of Queen Anne     
 (   ).                                </content>
