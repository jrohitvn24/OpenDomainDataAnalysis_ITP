		<content> In a Thatched cottage at Sanham Green 
 a husband and wife team have a        
 bookbinding business.  This started   
 from their love and collection of old 
 books, after taking an early          
 retirement.                           
 They attended courses over many weeks 
 at a College to learn the art of      
 bookbinding. Work is carried out in a 
 shed situated in the garden.They have 
 two presses,tools and varying         
 leathers.Books are repaired in leather
 tooled in gold leaf.                  
 A local wildlife artist started her   
 career at the age of thirty six,with  
 no formal training and what was a     
 hobby has now become a thriving       
 business.                             
 Her paintings for which she uses a    
 water based paint called gouache are  
 used to illustrate cards and          
 calendars.                            </content>
