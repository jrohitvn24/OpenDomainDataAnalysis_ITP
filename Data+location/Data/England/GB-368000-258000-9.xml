		<title>09HISTORY: TEDSTONE DELAMERE</title>
		<content> The church of Tedstone Delamere is set
 in the deep narrow valley of the Punch
 Bowl which looks out upon pastoral    
 scenes of valley and hills. The small 
 church has a single centre aisle and  
 is crowned by a shingle bell turret   
 with a pyramid cap. One enters via an 
 oil lit porch. The chancel is new but 
 the nave is ancient with stout{Norman 
 walls which may even be partly        
 Saxon.It has two{Norman}windows and an
 arch in the wall which may be part of 
 a Saxon doorway. There is a Norman    
 font with a primitive looking round   
 bowl, and a delicately traced Medieval
 oak screen. In the churchyard stand   
 two worn coffin lids. The shaft of the
 Medieval cross has a later head, but  
 the original with the carvings of the 
 Madonna and child is now in the wall  
 by the lychgate.
