		<content>   The main road from Bridgnorth to    
Wolverhampton (A454) runs from west to 
east across the north of this block.   
It is very busy, carrying traffic of   
all types, especially the cars of      
commuters working in the West Midlands.
It is also busy in the evenings and at 
weekends as Bridgnorth is a popular    
objective for outings and one of the   
few crossings of the River Severn.   In
spite of improvements the road is not  
wide and accidents happen frequently.  
   The B4176, part of a very old route 
from Ironbridge in Shropshire to Dudley
in the West Midlands, which  crosses   
the south-west corner of the area, is  
also quite busy.                       
   The few remaining roads in the      
district are all country lanes and     
rather narrow.
