		<title>19Churches In Frenchay</title>
		<content> Frenchay has an abundance of thriving 
 Churches. The C of E Parish Church is,
 unusually, a relative newcomer,       
 consecrated in 1834. Prior to this    
 Frenchay was dominated by             
 non-conformity with both a Quaker     
 Meeting House and a Unitarian Chapel  
 being constructed in the 17th century.
 Both these Chapels have well attended 
 services today and are used in        
 addition for exhibitions, concerts    
 and meetings.                         
   St John  Baptist the C of E Church  
 has congregations of over 100 at      
 Morning Services  and also runs a     
 Sunday School, and groups for prayer, 
 study, women and parents as well as a 
 music and drama guild and an          
 orchestra.                            
   There is also a Roman Catholic      
 Church, a Hospital Chapel and a       
 private Chapel in a Children's home.  </content>
