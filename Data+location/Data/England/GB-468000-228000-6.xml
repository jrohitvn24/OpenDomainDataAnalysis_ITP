		<title>06THE VILLAGE HALL, PADBURY</title>
		<content> When a new school was built in Padbury
 the old school was bought by the      
 village to be used as a Village Hall. 
 The Hall is used by many village      
 organisations;the Playgroup, Christian
 Fellowship, Women's Institute, Mothers
 Union, Friendly Afternoon, Dancing and
 Keep Fit Classes and Whist Drives. It 
 is also used for monthly meetings and 
 for A.G.M.s by several groups. It is  
 also let for private parties, dances, 
 wedding receptions etc. It is run by  
 a committee with representatives of   
 village organisations. Money from     
 hiring charges and fund raising       
 efforts keep the hall going. At the   
 present time money is being raised for
 a lot of maintenance work and proposed
 alterations. Recently a new toilet    
 block has been built and a damp-proof 
 course installed. It is truly the     
 centre of village life.               </content>
