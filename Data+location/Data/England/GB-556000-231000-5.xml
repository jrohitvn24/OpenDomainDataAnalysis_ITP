		<title>05PARISH PUMP MAGAZINE part 1</title>
		<content>      Originally there were two        
 publications in Debden,one puplished  
 by the{Parish Council}and one by the  
{Church Council.}In{April 1979}they    
 both amalgamated to form what is now  
 called the{Parish Pump.}The Parish    
 Pump got its name from the pump in the
 centre of the village, this was where 
 people used to go to collect their    
 water and while they were there they  
 talked with other villagers and       
 exchanged news. It therefore seemed   
 natural to call the village magazine  
 the Parish Pump. The editor of the    
 Parish Pump is{Mr. A McLean,}he has   
 been editor since 1982. The most      
 important thing about the magazine is 
 that it keeps people in touch with    
 village events,activities,functions,  
 and church services etc.The most      
 popular part of the magazine seems to 
 be the{letters page}....(cont pg.6)   </content>
