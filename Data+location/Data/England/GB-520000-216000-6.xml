		<title>06HOUSING IN CODICOTE/WELWYN</title>
		<content>  The absence of industrial development
 and the easy access to railway and    
 motorways has ensured that Codicote / 
 Welwyn is a popular residential area. 
  House prices are high - ranging from 
 Â£40,000 for a terraced cottage to     
 Â£175,000 for houses outside the       
 villages. There are over 2000         
 dwellings including 10 farms and 140  
 houses in rural positions. Codicote   
 village has 836 houses, flats and     
 bungalows including 300 owned by North
 Hertfordshire District Council. Welwyn
 has 912 dwellings of which 125 belong 
 to Welwyn/Hatfield District Council.  
  Both village centres have modernised 
 terraced Victorian cottages and villas
 beyond which are major post 1945      
 estates containing larger family      
 houses. Purpose built accommodation is
 available for the elderly.
