		<title>08Transport - Tamar Valley</title>
		<content>       Before  the  railway  was  built
 nearly every thing was transported  to
 and from the area by  boat up and down
 the River Tamar.  This was tin, copper
 and other ores from the mines, granite
 from Pearson's  quarries  for Plymouth
 docks  and London  paving,  fruit  and
 vegetables to Plymouth  markets. Horse
 manure was carried  up the  river from
 Plymouth streets, limestone  and  coal
 for the local limekilns and  goods for
 the mines.  Food was locally grown  so
 not much was bought from outside.     
       With the coming of  the  Railway
 and   the  construction   of  Calstock
 Viaduct  in 1908,  the  river  traffic
 gradually died out because it was much
 quicker by train.  This  was much used
 until  road transport  became  cheaper
 and more convenient.  Now the A390  is
 the main connecting link with outside.
