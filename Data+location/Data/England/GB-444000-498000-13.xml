		<title>13LIFE LONG RESIDENT OF I.A.</title>
		<content> Mrs Christon has lived in Ingleby A.  
 all her life (57yrs). She says she    
 likes living there because it is her  
 home. Sha has lived in 4 different    
 houses in the village. When she was a 
 girl she went to the old school where 
 there were no dinners and 2 classes   
 squashed into a very small building.  
 Four shops were in the village then   
 and buses went frequently to          
 Northallerton and Stokesley. Nowadays 
 peoples cars have replaced the bus    
 service.  When she was first married  
 she had no electricity or water in her
 house. She had to use the village     
 pump. Mrs Christon works as a dinner  
 lady at the school. Her two brothers  
 own the local coach hire firm which is
 based in the village and was          
 established by her grandfather in     
 1922.
