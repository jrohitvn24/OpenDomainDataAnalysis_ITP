		<title>20ADVENTURE PLAYGROUND</title>
		<content> We had a field at the top of the      
 villagewhich was supposed to be used  
 for games and things. But it was never
 used because the grass was too long   
 and anyhow, there was nothing there to
 play with.                            
 So some of us asked our parents to do 
 something about it and first of all   
 they asked the Parish Council if they 
 would get the grass cut They did and  
 they also put in goal posts and       
 marked out a football pitch.Then we   
 thought it would be a good idea to    
 have an adventure playground. Lots    
 of us did a sponsored walk to raise   
 money and now we've got an adventure  
 playgroundwhere we can go and play.   
 there still isn't enoughso we are     
 hoping to raise some more money to buy
 some more things and then it will be  
 the best in the area..
