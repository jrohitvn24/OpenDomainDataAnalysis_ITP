		<title>19A SMALLHOLDING</title>
		<content>     The following is a description of 
 a fairly typical holding although theY
 are changing at the moment since the  
 L.S.A. was disbanded.                 
    Lettuce is grown in the autumn and 
 winter, cropping all the glasshouses  
 twice. There are 1 1/4 acres of       
 glasshouses. About 100,000 lettuce are
 cut each crop.                        
     In spring and summer 60,000 heads 
 of celery are grown for cutting in May
 and June and 80,000 are grown outdoors
 for cutting in July. In addition 30   
 tons of tomatoes are grown.The seeds  
 are sown in December and the plants   
 put in the glasshouse in February.    
 Tomatoes are picked between May and   
 September.                            
    The work is done by husband and    
 wife with casual help at peak times.
