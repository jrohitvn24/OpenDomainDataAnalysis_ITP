		<content> Our area used to be completely{rural. 
 Then the{factories}came and belched   
 out smoke.They tipped rubbish every-  
 where.Some{factories}also cut down    
 trees to clear the area for building. 
 The{canal}became polluted as well.Our 
 area had been spoiled by industry.    
{     }Now our area is being restord to
 its former beauty.This is being done  
 by the{Youth Training Scheme.}They are
 landscaping shabby areas and clearing 
 the{Canal}from rubbish.Our area is    
 greatly improving.I would like to see 
 in our area changes that would make   
 it even more beautiful-plant more     
 trees and clear all the tips from     
 rubbish.I hope that people will appre-
 ciate all the improvements and keep   
 our area neat and tidy.
