		<content> Employment is at a remarkably high    
 level in this area.  This may be      
 because of a general affluence and the
 population make up of the area.  There
 are many retired people and a goodly  
 number of farmers and self employed   
 persons.  A large number of the       
 remaining male population is of the   
 "middle executive" type mainly        
 commuting to their jobs in Pershore,  
 Worcester or Birmingham.  There is    
 also a number of people employed in   
 Local Government.  Most of the school 
 leavers either progress to further    
 education or move to the larger towns 
 or cities for their further           
 employment.  The only residents       
 apparently desiring more employment   
 are married women with families who   
 are always interested in part time    
 jobs. Many enquiries for the job of   
 school secretary here were received.  </content>
