		<title>12Horse Trainer, Lound</title>
		<content> Mr. Wright who lives in Lound trains  
 horses for eventing.  He has one field
 of 6 acres and l2 stables.  At the    
 moment he is training lO horses.  He  
 has 3 people working for him.  They   
 work long hours, getting up at 6 a.m. 
 and sometimes not finishing until lO  
 p.m. but they all enjoy the work very 
 much.  They are sometimes sad when the
 horses leave but they are pleased to  
 get new ones.  Mr. Wright buys the    
 horses for about Â£3,OOO, trains them  
 for 2 years and then sells them again.
  If he hopes to enter them for the    
 Badminton Horse Trials, he keeps them 
 for 4 years.  The horses are sometimes
 taken abroad.  The horses are between 
 3 and 4 years old when he buys them   
 and they have not been broken in.     
 They stand between l5.2 and l7.4 hands
 high.
