		<title>07NEW PRIMARY SCHOOL ELMSWELL</title>
		<content> A new school is being built to replace
 the old one which will be sold. The   
 new school should open in 1986. It    
 will be a one storey brick building   
 which will be heated by oil. Most     
 floors are plastic or carpet, but the 
 hall floor is wood. There will be 5   
 classrooms, 2 practical rooms  (art,  
 craft, woodwork, cookery), a library, 
 T.V. room, large hall, showers,       
 kitchen and servery, kiln room, P.E.  
 store, staffroom, head teacher's room,
 caretaker's room, and an office.  The 
 computer will be moved around on a    
 trolley.                              
 The playground is tarmac, 37x27m. with
 a swimming pool. The children will use
 the council football pitch next door. 
 We saw the plans when we visited the  
 site. A workman said it might take    
 750,000 bricks to finish. We saw a    
 pond with ducklings on it.            </content>
