		<content> On a bus sat a girl. She wore a shirt 
 with sleeves rolled up and the tails  
 hanging out over her tight fitting    
 trousers which left her ankles bare.  
 Her feet were in flat pale blue       
 slippers with long criss-cross laces  
 tied round her ankles. Her hair was   
 tinted blond, cut very short and      
 brushed close to her head each side.  
 She wore little or no make-up. Her    
 companion had dark curls falling on   
 his shoulders. He wore very old jeans 
 and a loose faded jersey. At a funeral
 service, the congregation were mostly 
 elderly women. Most of them had their 
 hair cut short enough to be set in    
 small curls and waves. Only three wore
 hats, one being the widow. Some had   
 thin scarves over their heads. In the 
 country, fur and tweed coats are rare 
 as nearly everyone has a padded nylon 
 wind-proof jacket often with a hood.  </content>
