		<title>16SHOPS IN PETTS WOOD</title>
		<content>The first {shops} in {Petts Wood} were 
built on the north east side of        
Station Square in 1928. Nelsons        
newsagents, Hammetts the butchers,     
Lloyds Bank and Bilham's the           
fishmongers still stand today.         
Mr.Bilham the fishmonger in the pre    
war days sent one of his sons out on a 
bicycle to take orders in the morning  
and the fish was delivered by horse    
and cart to the housewives in time to  
be cooked for lunch.In 1983 {Safeway}  
supermarket was built on the site of   
the {Embassy cinema}. It is now the    
busiest shop in Petts Wood. Safeway    
sells fruit, vegetables, drinks, meat, 
sweets, frozen foods, books, biscuits, 
bathroom goods, cheeses and pet food.  
Many small specialist food shops have  
therefore gone out of business.        
Now the majority of shops sell shoes,  
toys, flowers, or stationery.          </content>
