		<title>02LIVING IN CARTHORPE</title>
		<content> I am an 11 year old boy who lives in  
 Carthorpe. My house is at least 10    
 years old. At the weekend I get up at 
 about 8 o'clock, get washed and       
 dressed, have my breakfast, and go    
 down to the pub to bottle-up. This    
 means that I fill up the shelves that 
 have been emptied the night before.   
 Sometimes this takes me about half an 
 hour, sometimes about two hours. That 
 is how I earn my pocket-money.        
 After work I go to find Michael and   
 Phillip and we play Tiggy-on-high,    
 which is off ground Tig. The one who  
 is {on }has to touch the others before
 they get off the ground. We then go on
 our bikes for a while. Later we play  
 in a little quarry we have made. We   
 move soil around with toy tractors and
 dumpers. We sieve the soil to make the
 tracks. Last week a wagon went over it
 and filled it all in.                 </content>
