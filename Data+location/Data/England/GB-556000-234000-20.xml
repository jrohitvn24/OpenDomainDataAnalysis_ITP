		<title>20Personal view of Wimbish.</title>
		<content> I came to Wimbish in 1967 when I was  
 appointed Headmaster of the Village   
 School. Over the years I have seen    
 many changes.As the indigenous        
 population die or move away they are  
 replaced with people who stay for a   
 short while and then move on.Years    
 ago many villagers were related.This  
 is not so now.When youngsters leave   
 school many move away to find work    
 which is no longer available near     
 home.The cost of homes are rising and 
 with the news that nearby Stansted    
 Airport is to be enlarged will rise   
 even more.Young people cannot afford  
 to buy homes in their own village.For 
 the old, life is hard. They become    
 reliant on others for shopping or     
 going to the Doctor.Those who can,    
 move away to a town.The village is now
 less of a community as many only come 
 home at night to sleep.{F.J.Haslock.} </content>
