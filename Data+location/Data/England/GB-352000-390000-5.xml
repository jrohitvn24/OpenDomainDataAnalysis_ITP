		<title>05HISTORY OF SUTTON MILL DAM</title>
		<content>    Sutton Mill Dam is between Clock   
 Face Road and Ellamsbridge Road. In   
 1845 there were only two dams, Sutton 
 Mill Dam and Dam House Dam. Both dams 
 had two main functions which were:-   
            1) to supply water power   
 for a corn mill at the head of Sutton 
 Mill Dam,  2) to provide a supply of  
 water for a plate glass firm.         
    This glass company had closed down 
 by 1864.                              
    After the First World War there was
 a campaign to attract new industry to 
 St. Helens.  In 1934 British Sidac    
 took over a site at Lancots Lane and  
 Cellophane was produced there. Large  
 amounts of water were necessary for   
 the production of cellophane. It was  
 fed into a holding dam at Ellamsbridge
 Road and then piped into the factory. 
    Records of the dam have been found 
 from the eighteenth century.          </content>
