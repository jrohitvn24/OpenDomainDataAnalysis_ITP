		<content> The northern half of the 4x3km block  
 is taken over by the North Downs. The 
 chalk escarpment runs east-west and is
 predominantly scrub land. The rest of 
 the Downs in this area are wooded with
 a mixture of deciduous and coniferous 
 trees. The southern part of the block 
 is farmland with the two villages of  
 Abinger Hammer and Gomshall on the A25
 running along the foot of the Downs.  
 The presence of the North Downs Way,  
 areas such as Abinger Roughs and      
 Netley Heath make this a popular area 
 with walkers and hikers.              
                                       
 The majority of the farmland is given 
 over to grazing for both cattle and   
 sheep. A watercress farm, however, is 
 situated on the edge of the village of
 Abinger Hammer. The beds of which are 
 fed by underground springs.
