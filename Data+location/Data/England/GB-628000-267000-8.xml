		<content> The ratio of those who are in full    
 time employment to those who are      
 retired is 1:1. In Dennington the     
 number of retired exceeds full time   
 workers by the same ratio. 26% of     
 retired people lived elsewhere before 
 retirement. Nearly half as many people
 have part time jobs as are in full    
 time employment. Of all workers 32%   
 are employed in agriculture; 23% are  
 self-employed; 24% work within 1 mile 
 of home; 48% between 1 &amp; 10 miles and 
 28% over 10 miles. Twice as many      
 people in Badingham compared to       
 Dennington work over 10 miles from    
 home.
