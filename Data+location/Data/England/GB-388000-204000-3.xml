		<title>03BISLEY'S FAMOUS PEOPLE</title>
		<content> The most famous  resident was Rev.    
 Thomas Keble, brother to the founder  
 of the Keble Oxford Movement. He was  
 vicar of Bisley from 1827 to 1873     
 and was a great builder for the       
 church.  By 1862 he had entirely      
 restored The Church of All Saints in  
 Bisley, built a church at Bussage,    
 at France Lynch and at Eastcombe.  He 
 was also responsible for building     
 schools at Bisley, Oakridge, Bussage, 
 Eastcombe and France Lynch. His son   
 also called Thomas, succeeded him and 
 was responsible for the legend of the 
 "Bisley Boy".Workmen excavating the   
 site for the new village school came  
 across a medieval stone coffin in     
 which were the bones of a girl.  The  
 remains were reputed to be those of   
 Elizabeth I who died while staying at 
 Overcourt. It is said that she was    
 replaced by a boy and so never married</content>
