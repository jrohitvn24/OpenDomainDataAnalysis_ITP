		<content> The Sheepdog Trials this year were    
 held on September 5th, 6th, and 7th,  
 and were the 87th trials to date,     
 being held on Longshaw Pastures, just 
 in front of the Lodge. Admission was  
 Â£1 for adults, 50p for pensioners and 
 children. The first Trials were held  
 in 1898 and it is said that a         
 challenge for the best shepherding by 
 a Sheepdog was instigated by rivals at
 the Fox House Inn. Due to poor        
 weather, this was postponed until the 
 summer, and has become a famous and   
 popular event over the ensuing years. 
 The Trials comprise of various dog    
 classed which require the farmer to   
 send his dog off on the outrun towards
 a group of 3 or 4 sheep at the bottom 
 of the field which may be 400 yards   
 away.
