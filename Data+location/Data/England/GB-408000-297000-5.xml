		<content> The National Health service allied    
 with the social welfare provisions is 
 the basic source of the wellbeing of  
 the district. The number of doctors in
 practice is above the national average
 due in some measure to the articulate 
 way in which most people express      
 themselves when talking to doctors.   
 Hospital care is nearby at Sutton     
 Coldfield, Birmingham and Lichfield.  
 There are normally no admission       
 problems except waiting lists         
 associated with some medical          
 condition,a trend, recently, has been 
 the number of people who are members  
 of the private medical insurance      
 schemes. This is sometimes a 'Perk'   
 related to employment, this increase  
 in membership of private schemes has  
 received a recent boost by the opening
 of a privately financed hospital at   
 Little Aston.                         </content>
