 letters in turn and if the players    
 have that letter in their name they   
 can move forward one step for each    
 letter until they reach the caller,   
 when they will become the caller in   
 their turn.                           
  The boys enjoy chain tag where one   
 boy chases the rest and when he has   
 caught one, they link hands and chase 
 together to catch a third and so on.  
  If you see a pile of shoes in the    
 middle of a circle then it will be a  
 game of "Cat's got the Measles".      
 Everyone says, "Cat's got the measles,
 Cat's got the flu, Chicken's got the  
 chicken pox, And so have you." They   
 all jump with legs apart and then legs
 crossed and if you finish with legs   
 crossed you put a shoe in the middle  
 but if you have legs apart, you can   
 take a shoe out of the pile.          </content>
