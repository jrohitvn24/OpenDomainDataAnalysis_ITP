		<title>05Wawne, farming.</title>
		<content> The soils round Wawne are a mixture of
 heavy boulder clay and 'carr' land,   
 which is basically river alluvium with
 some peat.                            
                                       
{Dairy farming}predominates with cerial
 grown as a secondary crop, wheat and  
 rape; occassionally beans.            
 All the grassland is fertilized and   
 takes the form of 'leys', which is    
 grass grown to be cut for silage.     
 After cutting the cattle are grazed on
 the stubble, as it is not cut right   
 down to the ground.Most farm buildings
 are near the village, although more   
 modern farm houses have been situated 
 further away.                         
                                       
 Two of the{seven}farms are owned by   
 large companies. The other five are   
 owner-occupied or rented.
