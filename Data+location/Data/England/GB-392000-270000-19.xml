		<title>19SCHOOL HOLIDAY ACTIVITIES</title>
		<content>    In the{school holidays}I do a lot  
 of things. I usually go to North Wales
 with my family for a few days. At home
 I play games on our{computer.}I play  
 the piano and spend some of my spare  
 time practising. My friend lives      
 nearby so I go to his house to play.  
 Sometimes we go to Sanders Park to    
 fish in the stream or we go to the    
 swimming baths. Near where I live     
 there is a school field and I go there
 to play cricket. I live in a quiet    
 close, so I play games outside my     
 house. I like to go to town to look in
 the shops. I like it when Boots have  
 their computers on so that I can see  
 the different games. There are plenty 
 of things to do.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
