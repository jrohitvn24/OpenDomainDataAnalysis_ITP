		<title>10"CORNED BEEF ISLAND", HULL</title>
		<content> The Preston Road estate built in the  
 20's was known to older residents as  
 "Corned Beef Island", due to its then 
 isolated position  necessitating the  
 stocking up with cheap food(O.S 1928) 
 "In 1927 we were the first tenants of 
 Ganstead Grove.We moved from          
 Northumberland Ave., from a "Sham 4", 
 because my brother had contracted a   
 mild case of T.B &amp; needed"fresh air". 
 It was our first house with a bathroom
 or garden". {Mrs.E.Campbell(Locking) }
  In subsequent years the estate became
 notorious for dereliction &amp; vandalism 
 especially Tunstall Gr.(see Hull Daily
 Mail 11/5/82 13/10/82 14/10/82        
 26/10/82).The city council decided to 
 upgrade the whole area at an average  
 cost of Â£8000 to try and improve its  
 "downmarket image".Tunstall Gr. was   
 subsequently converted into flats for 
 the elderly &amp; renamed"Campbell Court" </content>
