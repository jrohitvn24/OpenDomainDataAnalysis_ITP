  Northfield Wood lies immediately to  
the north of the small village of      
Onehouse.Soils are strong loams        
derived from glacial clays over-laying 
Norwich Crag.Rainfall averages 24      
inches per annum. Apart from 2.0       
hectares of 100 year old oak,ash and   
beech, and 2.0 hectares of 35 year old 
oak and hornbeam, the rest of the      
woodland has been replanted since      
1961,with coniferous species, mainly   
Norway spruce with some Western Red    
cedar and Scots pine and an expected   
rotation of between 50 and 60          
years.These plantations are well       
stocked and will shortly be requiring  
their first thinning.                  
   Deer,rabbits and foxes,             
thrive in the wood and can cause       
problems for local farmers.
