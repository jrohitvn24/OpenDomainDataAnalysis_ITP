		<title>05WATER EATON CHAPEL</title>
		<content> The chapel, built in 1610, is in the  
 grounds of Water Eaton Manor.On one of
 the walls of the chapel there is a    
 stone bay window which shows that the 
 main house might have been much       
 bigger.In the chapel there is a fine  
 example of a wine glass pulpit and    
 there is also a Victorian font and a  
 fine window in memory of G.F.Bodley.  
 There is a lovely old Victorian organ 
 that still works today.The chapel has 
 its own little garden with a high     
 stone wall around it and it is very   
 beautiful.
