		<content>   There are over forty km of roads,   
 most of which lead to houses on       
 estates.The A22 which links Eastbourne
 to the North and London carries the   
 most traffic,we found that in the     
 evening rush hour 2563 vehicles       
 travelled Northbound and 2544 vehicles
 were Southbound.The other major road  
 is the A27 which links Polegate to

   There are forty three bus stops in  
 the area.                             
   There is a taxi service based in our
 area and this charges 50 pence per    
 mile.                                 
   Polegate Railway Station connects   
 Eastbourne, London and Brighton.307
