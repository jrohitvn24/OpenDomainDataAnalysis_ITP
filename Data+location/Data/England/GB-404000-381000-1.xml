		<title>01Chinley - a general picture</title>
		<content> This block is bounded on the West by  
 the village of Chinley, whose once    
 vast railway station now shows only a 
 vestige of its former glory,attested  
 by the now incongruous presence of a  
 large railway hotel,the Prince's.     
 Hill farming is now the chief industry
 though three textile-finishing mills  
 adorn the banks of the Black Brook and
 to the SE lies the sprawling Ferodo   
 complex, home of motor car brake      
 linings.                              
 The theme of Transport,old and new,   
 dominates the valley,from the remnants
 of the 18th C Tramway to the massive  
 double railway viaducts at Chapel     
 Milton and the brown scar of by-pass  
 workings.                             
 Even so,the area is still almost pure 
 "country",a happy mix of old and new, 
 local farmer and commuting executive  
 living cheek by jowl.                 </content>
