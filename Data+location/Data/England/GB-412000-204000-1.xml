		<content>  The three villages of{Hatherop, Coln 
{St Aldwyns}and{Quenington}lie close   
 to each other in the beautiful valley 
 of the{River Coln}between Bibury and  
 Fairford. Most of the land in our     
 block is farmland but there is a lot  
 of parkland in the area of the three  
 villages. Most of the houses are built
 of Cotswold stone.                    
  There are records of people living in
{Hatherop}since 1042. The original     
 Domesday Book records about two dozen 
 people.Today about one hundred people 
 live in Hatherop. There are two large 
 houses in the village, Williamstrip   
 House and Hatherop Castle. Hatherop   
 Castle is now a private school. There 
 is also a primary school in the       
 village.
