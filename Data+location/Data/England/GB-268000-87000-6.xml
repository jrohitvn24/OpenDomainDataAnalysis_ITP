		<title>06FARMING IN/AROUND CHAGFORD</title>
		<content> Around Chagford there is a great      
 number of farms which vary in size.   
 Many isolated farmsteads are dotted on
 the moorland landscape and the main   
 types of farming are{cattle and sheep.
 In this area soil cover is thin and   
 not fertile enough to produce sizeable
 crops for arable farming.  Most crops 
 grown are for feeding animals, such as
 silage, hay and corn. {Dairy cattle   
 are more widespread than{Beef cattle, 
 while a great number of {sheep}are to 
 be seen in the fields. In our block   
 there is only one{Pig}farm of any     
 size.  Chagford has its own{Livestock 
{Market,}held monthly, and local farm_ 
 ers also visit the{Exeter}market, held
 weekly.  As stated elsewhere, farming 
 accounts for the employment of a great
 deal of people in this area.
