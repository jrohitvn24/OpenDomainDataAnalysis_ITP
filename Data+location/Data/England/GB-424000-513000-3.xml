		<content>    Within our area of twelve square   
 kilometres there are quite a variety  
 of religious faiths.There are twelve  
 different ones, the most common ones  
 are Church of England,Roman           
 Catholic and Methodist.There are also 
 quite a number of less common ones,   
 Jews, Quakers and United Reform.      
 Darlington is known as a Quaker town. 
    Our part of town is served by eight
 churches and a synagogue.Three Church 
 of England, three Roman Catholic and  
 two Methodist.There is also a Jewish  
 synagogue.It is on Bloomfield Road.   
  Members of the less common religions 
 may have to travel up to thirty miles 
 to go to church every Sunday          
    The Jewish religion may be a less  
 common religion but the Jews need not 
 travel out of Darlington to go to a   
 synagogue every Saturday.
