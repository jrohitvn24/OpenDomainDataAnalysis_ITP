		<title>17Our Centenary        B'ham</title>
		<content>On Thursday 12th April 1984 it was our 
school Centenary. We had special guests
like Sir Winston Churchill who is the  
great grandson of Sir Randolph         
Churchill. There was Mr Bennett the    
Headmaster before Mr Long, John        
Crawford the Chief Education Officer,  
the Bishop of Birmingham did not come. 
The choir sang 'The Lord's My Shepherd'
and some of the juniors did a play in  
a school 100 years ago and in the      
future. Sir Winston Churchill presented
a school clock to the oldest girl and  
the youngest boy. Then we went outside 
to have a photograph. We then saw      
dancing. I was in a gymnastic dance    
called 'Sailing.' There were other     
dances such as a Maypole dance, Square 
Dancing and Country Dancing. We had two
cakes, one shaped like a 100 and the   
other was square.
