 including experimental{University     
{dairy farm.}Land is also used for{corn
{crops}and{vegetables.}Good pasture.   
 Cows, sheep, pigs and battery farmed  
 chickens are raised. All animals and  
 poultry are also used for meat produc_
 tion.                                 
{Dairy produce}includes milk, butter,  
 cream, cheese and yoghurt. A good cow 
 produces 40_80 gallons a day. Milking 
 is all mechanised. Cows are milked    
 twice daily at 6a.m. and 4p.m. Animals
 are fed on hay and sileage during the 
 winter months. Sileage is made from   
 grass, clover and rape.               
{Animal and crop production}is governed
 by consumer demand. Growth in demand  
 for frozen meats has led farmers to   
 raise animals of a standard size.     
{Battery farming}is very cruel but     
 farmers make more money this way.     </content>
