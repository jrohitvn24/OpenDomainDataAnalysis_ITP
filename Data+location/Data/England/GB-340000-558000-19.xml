		<content> In the village of Linstock there is   
 market garden owned by the Lamb       
 family.The building was built in 1797.
 It has been a market garden for 70    
 years.Before MR Lamb owned it his     
 father and grandfather owned it 50    
 years ago.He has 6 acres of land,0.33 
 of greenhouses.He grows lettuces,     
 tomatoes,potatoes,cucumbers,beans,    
 courgettes,cellery,green peppers,     
 beetroots,leeks,brussel sprouts,      
 cabbage,and spring onions.MR Lamb     
 sells his vegtables to the market in  
 CARLISLE.MRS Lamb said the soil is    
 good but we cannot grow carrots.They  
 plant the lettuces every 2 weeks,     
 the vegtables are not ready together  
  because they plant them at different 
 times.
