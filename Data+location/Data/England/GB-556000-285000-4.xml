 time because it will be moving to the 
 village college site.                 
 The school was built in 1846. By 1870,
 there were 537 children. Being a rural
 area, there were split summer         
 holidays and leaving at 12 if you

 had its own school and pupils had to  
 walk every day. The last one to close
