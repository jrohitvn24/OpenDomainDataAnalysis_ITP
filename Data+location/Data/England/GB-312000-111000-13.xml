		<title>13The milk factory</title>
		<content> The factory produces St. Ivel Gold, a 
 low fat dairy spread. About one       
 hundred million cartons a year        
 are produced, but soon production will
 rise to two hundred million cartons a 
 year, one hundred million more because
 of an extension taking place. For the 
 extra work they will only have twenty 
 more people. That will make the total 
 number of workers two hundred and     
 twenty one. It will cost seven million
 pounds. Inside the factory people have
 to wear special clothes such as       
 hairnets, overalls, hat and           
 boots. There is an eletricial         
 work-shop and a new canteen being     
 built. The employees work on twelve   
 hour shifts. There are thirty eight   
 lorries coming and going a day. A     
 crossing patrol for the school is     
 sponserd by the factory.
