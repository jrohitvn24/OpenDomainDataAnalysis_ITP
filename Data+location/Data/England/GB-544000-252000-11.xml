		<content>  In this 1km square the land use was  
 mainly arable containing many fields  
 and scattered farmhouses.             
                                       
  There were a number of residential   
 places consisting mainly of houses and
 flats, with also some office blocks   
 and a very large Jewson warehouse.    
                                       
  There was also a sports field, which 
 was the only place of recreation. The 
 river Cam also ran through this       
 square.                               
                                       
  In the adjacent sqaure the land use  
 was also arable, again there were     
 scattered farmhouses. The railway also
 runs through this square.
