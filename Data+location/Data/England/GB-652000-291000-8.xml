 This is a game called "What's the time
Mr. Wolf?" One person is "on". He or   
she stands against the wall and shuts  
his eyes. The other children stand     
about 10 metres away.  Someone asks    
him the time. If he says   4 o'clock,  
you take 4 steps forward; 7 o'clock    
you take 7 steps forward and so on. As 
soon as he answers with "dinner-time", 
you have to run away and if he catches 
you, you have to be "on" next and the  
game starts all over again.            
This is a very traditional playground  
game and it has been played in this    
part of England, certainly in Norfolk  
and Suffolk for many, many years. It   
mostly appeals to children between the 
ages of 5 and 8 years.
