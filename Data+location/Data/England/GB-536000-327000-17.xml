		<title>17Shopping,the Hurn block.</title>
		<content> The village of Holbeach Hurn has only 
 one shop.It is also a Post Office.It  
 opens at seven o'clock in the morning 
 and does a lot of trade with the      
 agricultural gangs who are contracted 
 to work in the nearby fields.Many     
 local people have to be at work early 
 so it is very useful to have the shop 
 open for milk, bread and other        
 necessary things so early in the      
 day.The village shop sells all sorts  
 of things like children's clothes and 
 small gifts and most other small      
 items.Many people sell their own      
 produce at the roadside outside their 
 homes.Vegetables can be bought very   
 cheaply this way.For major household  
 items such as furniture,and for       
 shoes,adults clothes,and cars         
 etc.people have to travel to          
 Holbeach,Spalding,Boston,Kings Lynn or
 Peterborough.                         </content>
