		<title>10Tourists in Mentmore</title>
		<content> The goods in the shop are entirely    
 made by British craftspeople and are  
 displayed to advantage among the old  
 horse boxes. Everything in the tea-   
 room is hand-made by a team of 4 local
 people and the owner herself rises at 
 6.30 a.m. to bake the scones, at the  
 same time as curling the butter and   
 preparing the grapefruit for the      
 breakfast of over-night visitors.     
 There are never any empty bedroms.    
 This place caters mostly for          
 businessmen and offers a homely, yet  
 unusual stopover, but they also have  
 honeymooners.{The Stag Hotel,}just up 
 the road, has an excellent restaurant 
 and there is great liaison between    
 these two places. I was asked to      
 stress that Mentmore is a wonderful   
 place and that its residents - some 70
 families - are among the world's best.
