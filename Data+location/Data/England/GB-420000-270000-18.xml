		<content>{WEATHER}Mrs.Daffern said that there   
 used to be hotter summers and colder  
 winters.During the summer the children
 would sit outside to get cool before  
 going to bed.Only the rich used to go 
 abroad for holidays.                  
{FASHION}has greatly improved.Ladies'  
 fashion is extremely varied with many 
 colours and styles; men's fashion has 
 changed less.Clothes are more         
 hygienic, and make-up is popular. Ear-
 piercing is not new,but much cheaper. 
{HAIRSTYLES}are more outrageous now    
 because of gel,mousse and spray.Any   
 length of hair is fashionable, and so 
 are brightly-coloured dyes. Hair can  
 be curled or straight as you wish.    
{MEDICINE}We are now immunised against 
 various serious diseases,which used to
 cause suffering - TB, polio.'Flu and  
 scarlet fever were deadly.Hay-fever   
 is still as bad as it used to be.     </content>
