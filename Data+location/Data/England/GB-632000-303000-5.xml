		<content> Brickmaking formed the major part of  
 the working community of Rockland     
 St.Mary in the last century.The       
 brickyard,which was owned by the      
 squire of Ashley Hall,was closed in   
 the first year of World War II.It has 
 2 open-air kilns.Before this,in the   
 eighteen-thirties the workers used to 
 have to go to the pub in Claxton.     
 This was too far away from the brick  
 yard for the men to walk in their     
 lunch-hour.To cater for this,a pub was
 built next to the brickyard.This was  
 called the New Inn.Since the 1950's   
 the pub has stopped serving redundant 
 brickmakers and started catering for  
 the tourists which now provides 90% of
 their trade.
