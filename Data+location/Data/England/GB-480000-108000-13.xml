		<content> tested our balancing skills.          
                                       
 On reaching the top, we could see the 
 South Coast and the Isle of Wight, a  
 good view for map reading.            
                                       
 We walked a short distance to the     
 tumuli and played a Sussex game based 
 on a legend _ whilst holding your     
 breath, run round the hump three times
 to make the devil jump on your back!  
                                       
 We picnicked halfway up the hill,     
 although there were no litter bins,   
 lavatories or shops anywhere.         
                                       
 An ideal place for kite flying and in 
 winter tobogganing is fun.  Grass     
 skiing is possible.  The area is ideal
 for rambling, but dogs must be kept on
 leads.
