		<title>01 THE AREA IN GENERAL</title>
		<content>     The area covered by our rectangle 
is mainly rural and there is one main  
settlement,Betley,in the S.E.corner.   
The land is fairly flat and it is a    
mixture of pasture for milk and beef   
cattle,cereals and some potatoes.The   
average size of the farms 100-200      
acres.There are some woods and         
many trees along roadsides making      
a pleasant and varied landscape.There  
are several public footpaths across the
fields.There is one main road through  
Betley.The two nearst big towns are    
Crewe and Newcastle-Under-Lyme the     
main road goes to both of them. Betley 
was on a stage coach route and has     
many inns.It is still a very small     
village. There is a electrified        
railway going through the area it is   
the main line  from London through     
Crewe to the North of England and      
Scotland.                              </content>
