		<title>12FARMING IN HARNHILL</title>
		<content> Mr. Robert Henly farms at Harnhill    
 and his land extends into nearby      
 Driffield. His father, Abraham Henly, 
 bought the farm in 1918, and his      
 family came to live in the Manor House
 in 1923. Before then, they lived at   
 Barton Farm, Siddington. During the   
 second World War, the Henlys responded
 to the call for self-sufficiency in   
 Britain's food supplies by increasing 
 the arable acreage to 650 and greatly 
 reducing the permanent pasture and the
 size of the beef and sheep enterprises
 . For 45 years, from 1939 to the      
 present time, Harnhill has continued  
 to concentrate on cereals as its main 
 farm product. They occupy three       
 quarters of the area; the remaining   
 quarter  provides forage for a flock  
 of 750 ewes for fat-lamb production.
