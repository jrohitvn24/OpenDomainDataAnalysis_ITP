		<title>08Entertainment In South Kyme</title>
		<content> Apart from clubs, villagers find      
 entertainment out of the village:-    
 cinemas or theatres in local towns.   
  The Football Club and W.I. organise  
 dances. The W.I. has an Amateur       
 Dramatic Group, which usually produces
 an annual comedy play. For home enter-
 tainment, many people own televisions 
 and radios, with a few owning video   
 recorders and computers. BBC Radio    
 Lincolnshire is heard by many.        
{CUSTOMS:}Feast week is the first week 
 in November. The W.I. organise a Chine
 Supper every Kyme Feast. Chine is a   
 joint of bacon, stuffed with chopped  
 parsley, and is a traditional         
 Lincolnshire dish. Most families,     
 until recently, fed and killed a pig  
 each year for food. A dole for the    
 poor and needy of the village, left by
 a man called Marmaduke Dickinson, is  
 handed out by the vicar at Christmas. </content>
