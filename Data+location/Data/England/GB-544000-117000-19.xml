		<title>19Coal Merchants, Ridgewood.</title>
		<content>   This{family business}was set up in  
 the mid 1930's. Whilst its primary    
 concern is with coal deliveries, haul-
 age of animal feedstuffs has become   
 important in recent years. This has   
 been because of the uncertainty of    
 future demand for coal. Some areas    
 have had mains gas installed which now
 means that there are fewer customers. 
   Before the{coal strike}(1984_85)    
 about{2000 tons}pa came from England &amp;
 Wales. During the strike coal was im_ 
 ported from{Germany &amp; China;}10 to 15%
 continues to come from abroad.        
   When the coal arrives it is bagged  
 for delivery. There are 1200{customers
 within a radius of 16km,4 lorries are 
 used: 1 with a capacity of 4 tons,2 of
 8 and 1 of 14 (used for haulage). Six 
 people are employed plus a secretary. 
 Four are drivers,two help with deliv- 
 eries &amp; one works in the yard.        </content>
