		<title>10RIVER TEES BRIDGES</title>
		<content> The R.Tees runs roughly due east from 
 Pennines to North Sea. Just to the    
 south and roughly parallel, runs the  
 A66, the busy trunk road linking north
 and west with south and east.         
 Crossings of the river to gain access 
 to the A66 at Middleton, Romaldkirk,  
 Barnard Castle, Eggleston Abbey,      
 Winston and Whorlton are all effected 
 by bridges. The latter is a steel     
 built suspension bridge with a weight 
 limit of 3 tons, so it is closed to   
 commercial traffic.                   
 The others are all stone bridges,     
 built in the days of horses and todays
 heavy vehicles are ruining them. In   
 the last two years every one has been 
 closed for several months for urgent  
 repairs. What is required is that one 
 of them should be replaced by a modern
 bridge and road system to accommodate 
 todays increasingly heavy traffic.    </content>
