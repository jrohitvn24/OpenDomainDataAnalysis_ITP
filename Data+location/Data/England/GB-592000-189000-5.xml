		<title>05PARISH COUNCIL</title>
		<content> In 1973 the three parish councils of  
 Paglesham, Foulness and Barling Magna 
 all got together and changed their    
 name to the Roach Group Parish        
 Council.They changed their name       
 because the River Roach ran past      
 their area. As the three Parish       
 Councils are all a fair way from  each
 other they take turns to go to each   
 others board rooms to discuss the     
 local problems. The Parish Council is 
 responsible for street lighting,      
 footpaths and helping to solve local  
 problems.
