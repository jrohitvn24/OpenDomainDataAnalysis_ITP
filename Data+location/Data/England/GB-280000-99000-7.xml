		<title>07Transport in Crediton</title>
		<content>   A number of{buses}come into Crediton
 each day. Most of the buses belong to 
 a firm from Exeter called Devon       
 General, but some belong to other     
 firms like Mid-Devon and Bow Belle,   
 which do tours as well. There is a bus
 going into Crediton every hour during 
 the day.                              
   There are also two{taxi}services.   
   There is a{railway}station at       
 Fordton,which is just outside         
 Crediton. It isn't in a very good     
 place for a station but it has to be  
 there because the railway follows the 
 Yeo valley. Not many trains stop there
 for passengers. Most of the people    
 that go on the trains go to Exeter or 
 Barnstaple.                           
   Most people in Crediton have a{car.
