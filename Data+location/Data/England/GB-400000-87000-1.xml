		<title>01Brownsea Island</title>
		<content> Brownsea Island is 500 acres in       
 extent, measuring 1\ miles long by \  
 mile wide. Together with the smaller  
 island of Furzey it lies at the       
 entrance to the great natural habour  
 of Poole in Dorset.                   
 After a chequered history the island  
 now belongs to the National Trust and 
 it is open to the public daily from   
 April to the end of September.        
 Around 100,000 visitors come to       
 Brownsea each year and on the day of  
 our visit (14th July 1985), in rather 
 cloudy weather, 435 people had paid to
 come ashore including a party of 33   
 West German students, 16 tourists from
 Spain and a family of 4 from          
 Bangladesh.                           
 Browsea now has a resident{population}
 of about 30 people most of whom work  
 for the National Trust.
