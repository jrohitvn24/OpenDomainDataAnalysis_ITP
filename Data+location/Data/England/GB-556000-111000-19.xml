		<content> If I could run, I'd run to{Stone Cross
{Church}at the junction  of the A27 and
 THE B2104, with all the wildlife  and 
 plants on three sides of it. The birds
 nesting on the pews,the daisies and   
 buttercups creeping through the stone 
 on the ground. The rabbits, hedgehogs,
 mice and other little animals         
 scampering about the floor. In the    
 daytime owls and bats sleep soundly,  
 hanging from and perching on the old  
 beams in the roof. The remains of old 
 pictures and paintings still hang on  
 the walls. The roof tiles are cracked 
 and missing, letting suc beams shine  
 on the stone and light up the old     
 church. Out at the back of the church 
 cows and sheep graze in the fields.   
 This building is a lovely old place.  
 If I could I would stay at{Stone Cross
{Church}forever.
