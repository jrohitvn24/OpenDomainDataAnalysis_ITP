 Just behind our school is Manor Farm. 
 Mr Knowles is the farmer and he has   
 about 450 acres of land owned by the  
 Dutchy.It is a mixed farm and they    
 grow wheat,oats,barley,peas and       
 potatoes as well as having 140 milking
 frezian cows.As well as the farmer    
 there is his son and four farmworkers 
 to work the land. They use modern     
 machines and have tractors,mowers,a   
 baler,spreaders,seed drill,sprayers   
 and various trailers.They grow much of
 the food for their cattle and at the  
 moment they are making silage and hay.
 The milk is cllected each day and     
 taken by tanker to Frome for          
 processing.Much of the processed milk 
 ends up in London.The farmhouse was   
 built in 1620 and is a big stone      
 house.We interviewed Mr Knowles on    
 July 12th.1985.                       </content>
