		<title>19Conservation in Haltwhistle</title>
		<content>   A line of crags known as the Nine   
 Nicks of Thirlwall form a dramatic    
 skyline to the north of Haltwhistle.  
 Hadrian built his Wall along the top  
 of this outcrop of the Great Whin     
 Sill.  It escaped the fate of other   
 sections of the Wall which were used  
 by General Wade to build his Military 
 Road.  Quarrying the whinstone for    
 road chippings removed two of the     
 Nicks and part of the Wall, leaving   
 ugly scars.                           
   In 1974 Cawfields Quarry was tidied 
 up, the deepest section flooded and an
 attractive picnic site created.  At   
 Walltown Quarry bulldozers are busy,  
 and plans to create a theme park with 
 reconstructions of a mile castle and  
 part of the Wall, are being examined. 
   Another picnic site is being created
 where the Burn enters Haltwhistle and 
 many young trees have been planted.   </content>
