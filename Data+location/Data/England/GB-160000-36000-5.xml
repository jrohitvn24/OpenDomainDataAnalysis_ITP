 On most of the walls at the Smugglers 
 Inn there are murals of smugglers.    
 These were painted by a local artist  
 whose nick-name was Skip.             
 They have an African Grey Parrot      
 called Percy which sometimes talks.   
 The pub is known throughout the world 
 for its jazz performances on Sundays. 
 There are discos,singing and pub      
 games,for example,snooker,darts and   
 pool.There are arcade games and a     
 juke-box.                             
 The customers who spend time in the   
 four bars and restaurant are local    
 people and some holiday makers.       
 The tourists sleep in the old part    
 but not many people stay there as it  
 is not in one of the major resorts.   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
