 different dwellings.  Different types 
 include:  manor houses, detached,     
 semi-detached, bungalows, farm        
 houses,and terraced houses.           
 The most common type of house is the  
 detached some of which are over 100   
 years old.  Most of the recently built
 properties are detached houses or     
 bungalows.                            
 The terraced houses are the most      
 cheapest to build and run, but no new 
 terraced houses have been built in the
 area.                                 
 There is a group of 7 old peoples'    
 semi-detached bungalows in Marston    
 built and owned by the council.
