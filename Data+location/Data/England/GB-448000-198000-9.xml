		<content>In our block we found out there were   
nine educational establishments-Four   
primary schools,one Junior school,one  
nursery (3-4),two secondary schools,   
and a College of further education.    
 The "schools" with age groups and     
pupil numbers are as follows.          
 Dumore Nursery(3-4)-60 pupis; Dunmore 
Infants(5-7)-220 pupils; Dumore Juniors
(7-11)-325 pupils; Manor Prep(4-11)-277
pupils; Fitzharrys(11-18)-1000 pupils; 
Radley College(13-18)-594 pupils;Rush  
Common-(5-11)-415 pupils; College of   
F.E.(16-65)-5000 students; Sunningwell

 All seven educational establishments  
in North Abingdon were built after the 
second world war because, before that  
time,North Abingdon only had houses in 
Northcourt.The rest was farmland.      
 The two independent schools have twice
the number of teachers as the others.  </content>
