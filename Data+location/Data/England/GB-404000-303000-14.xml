		<title>14FUTURE PLANS FOR CLAYHANGER.</title>
		<content>   The Clayhanger area in the past has 
 suffered from the ravages of man.Local
 mining operations resulted in         
 subsidence and part of the village    
 became a water-filled hollow.This has 
 been somewhat remedied by reclamation.
   However,future plans for Clayhanger 
 could create new environmental        
 problems.The Aldridge/Brownhills Local
 Plan envisages the building of 1200   
 houses whilst the National Coal Board 
 wishes to begin opencast mining in the
 area.Furthermore,one proposed         
 alternative road to relieve congestion
 on the M6 passes through land adjacent
 to Clayhanger.Such schemes could      
 endanger the present village's        
 character.The Urban Wild Life Group   
 has objected to these plans as it is a
 Grade A site for natural conservation.
 They propose that the area be declared
 a Local Nature Reserve.               </content>
