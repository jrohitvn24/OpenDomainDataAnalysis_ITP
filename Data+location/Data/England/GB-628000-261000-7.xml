		<title>07Framlingham Market Day</title>
		<content>Saturday is market day in Framlingham. 
The market is held on Market Hill.     
Most people come regularly. The cost   
is   $2.00 for a site but you have to  
bring   your own stall. The charity    
stall costs only $1.00 if you come from
Famlingham but $2.00 for outsiders.    
Some come from as far as Ipswich, which
means setting up very early. Hardly    
anybody is about then but after a      
while the street fills and bustles     
with busy shoppers. Even so hardly any 
accidents happen. In winter you get    
less stalls which is just as well with 
ice on the roads. The market packs up  
at 5:00. The shops owners are all      
friendly and there is no trouble       
between the stalls and the shops. I    
like having a market because there are 
good bargains to be had. The Town      
Council owns the Market Hill and       
collectts the income from the stalls.  </content>
