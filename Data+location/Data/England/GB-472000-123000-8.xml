		<content>{Downgate}farm is a free-range chicken 
 farm.  Mr. Coots has about 40 acres of
 grassland.  He has about 7000 chickens
 and his main business is selling eggs.
 He also keeps a few sheep.  When the  
 chickens are too old for laying eggs  
 they are taken to a chicken factory   
 and killed to be used for making      
 chicken pies and chicken soup.        
                                       
{Ridge}farm is a beef-producing farm of
 63 acres. It has 30 steers. The farmer
 feeds his animals twice a day. They   
 have cattle nuts in winter and in     
 summer grass. In winter they sleep    
 inside. When they are old enough they 
 go to the slaughter house.
