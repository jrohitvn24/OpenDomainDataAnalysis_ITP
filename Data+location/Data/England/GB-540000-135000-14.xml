		<title>14SHOPS IN FOREST ROW</title>
		<content>                                       
 During the week starting May 15th,    
 we polled all the pupils who live in  
 Forest Row on a simple issue-are the  
 shops there adequate? The shops in    
 question are only in our assigned     
 block.The answer was in the positive  
 though many did shop in East Grinstead
 because of the increased variety.When 
 asked if any new shops are needed, 2  
 proved the most popular: a new bike   
 shop and a new sports shop.The area   
 studied has a large variety of shops  
 ranging from the standard(P.O., cake  
 shop,grocers x2, banks) to the more   
 unusual.There is a specialist sports  
 car and speed boat shop, 2 health food
 shops, a traditional bakers, an       
 outdoor activities shop and a luxury  
 food shop.
