      "Hello. My name is Graham. I go  
 to Dunn Street School in Jarrow.      
 Sometimes I go out to play with my    
 friends on the flyover. That's a      
 bridge over a motorway. I like        
 watching the television at night and  
 my father goes out to the pub most    
 nights. He says, "Give me a bottle of 
 Newcastle Brown Ale, barmaid", a few  
 times then staggers home for his mince
 and potatoes. That's all for now,bye."</content>
