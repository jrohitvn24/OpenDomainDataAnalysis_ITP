		<title>01SUMMARY OF THE EGGINTON AREA</title>
		<content> Egginton is a small village situated  
 to the S.W. of Derby in the valley of 
 the River Dove. The village lies just 
 off the A38, the old Roman Ryknield   
 Street. It is surrounded by mixed     
 arable and pasture farmland. Many of  
 the farms stand in the village which  
 has recently expanded as new houses   
 fill the vacant spaces.               
      There is a post office and the   
 small primary school is also the      
 village hall. The 13th C church is    
 dedicated to St. Wilfrid. The area is 
 crossed by a railway line and the     
 Trent and Mersey canal. There are     
 several sites for the extraction of   
 sand and gravel.                      
      The village of Rolleston on Dove 
 is situated in the S.W. of the block.
