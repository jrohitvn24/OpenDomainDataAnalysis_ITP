 Industry Act for the improvement of   
 social conditions the South Hetton    
 Colliery Welfare Association was      
 formed.In 1927 the committee purchased
 land for cricket and football which is
 still in existence and has been       
 extended to include another football  
 pitch,tennis courts and childrens play
 area.

 the centre of the village opposite the
 colliery and occupies premises built  
 in 1895 which were originally the
