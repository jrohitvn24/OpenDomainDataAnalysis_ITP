		<title>07CHEESE MAKING AT HUNTBACH'S</title>
		<content>                                       
 There is a cheese making farm two     
 miles away from Adderley at Heyfields 
 farm,but locally it's called          
 Huntbach's Cheese Making Farm.Andrew  
 and I went to watch them making       
 cheese.There were three people working
 in the building,a woman and two       
 men.They start in the morning at about
 five o'clock and finish at twelve     
 o'clock.Huntbach's have been making   
 cheese since 1957.When the Cheshire   
 Cheese is made it goes to Crewe to be 
 sold in the open market.They make 2000
 gallons of milk into cheese everyday  
 half of it comes from Northwards      
 Farm.When they have made the cheese   
 they have to put it in metal          
 containers and then press it.After it 
 has been pressed it goes to the store 
 room for up to five days.
