		<title>16LONGFORD RANGERS FOOTBALL</title>
		<content>    FOOTBALL IS A VERY GOOD GAME.      
 LONGFORD HAS GOT ITS OWN TEAM. WE PLAY
 THE OTHER VILLAGES IN THE AREA, LIKE  
 SHIRLEY, OSMASTON AND KIRK LANGLEY.   
    WE PLAY ON A FIELD IN FRONT OF THE 
 OSTRICH INN. WE HAVE GOT OUR OWN      
 CHANGING ROOM. IT IS RATHER SMALL. IT 
 IS OUTSIDE AND VERY COLD.             
    WE HAVE OUR OWN COACH WHO IS CALLED
 MICK PHILPS. HE IS A GREAT COACH.     
    THERE ARE TWO TEAMS ONE FOR OVER 14
 YEARS AND ONE FOR THOSE UNDER.        
    WE WIN MOST OF THE MATCHES, BUT WE 
 DONT MIND IF WE LOSE.
