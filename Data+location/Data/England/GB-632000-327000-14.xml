		<title>14HONING OUTDOOR RECREATION</title>
		<content> In our area there are opportunities   
 for coarse fishing,horse riding, bird 
 watching and rambling. There are no   
 theatres, cinemas, public tennis      
 courts,golf courses and supermarkets. 
 The rarest bird to be seen in the area
 is the golden oriole. Kingfishers live
 along the drain banks and streams.    
 Green woodpeckers live in the trees   
 and spotted woodpeckers amongst the   
 gorse.Weavers Way is a disused railway
 which is now part of Norfolk's long   
 distance footpath network.The stretch 
 that enters our area startsmat Stalham
 and leads to Nth.Walsham.It was an    
 M&amp;GN railway,and the brickwork of the 
 waiting rooms and platforms at Honing 
 station is still visible. The         
 Nth.Walsham/Dilham canal is not used  
 as such now, but canoeists are able to
 navigate parts of its shallow course.
