		<title>08FORD AND WHARTON Cont.</title>
		<content>   River levels have obviously changed 
 over the centuries. Wharton was once  
 called{Wavertun (the town by the      
{water),}and when{Wharton Court}was    
 built in{1604}it cannot have been     
 customary for the river to flood.     
 Today the cellars are unusable because
 of the flooding.                      
   There are three possibilities why   
 the village at{Wharton was deserted:  
{disease, enclosure}when the Court was 
 built, or a{change in the water level 
{in the river.}The inhabitants may have
 moved to{Newton}on higher ground to   
 the South-West.
