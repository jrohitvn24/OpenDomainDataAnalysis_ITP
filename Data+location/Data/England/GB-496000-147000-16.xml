		<title>16HOME LIFE</title>
		<content>   I live in a semi-detached house with
 a kitchen (diner), a sitting room and 
 a hall downstairs, and three bedrooms,
 a bathroom, a toilet and a loft (and  
 darkroom) upstairs.                   
   I come from a family of five. I have
 a Mum, a Dad, a sister called Eve, and
 a black cat called Polly. We have one 
 car, a black Metro City.              
   We have three meals a day breakfast,
 lunch and dinner. We have one black   
 and white portable television, a      
 record player and two radios. In our  
 kictchen we have a fridge-freezer,    
 cooker and washing machine. We eat all
 our meals in the kitchen, but if it is
 very hot we eat outside on the patio, 
 and we sometimes have a bar-be-cue.   
   My interests are drawing, tennis,   
 badminton, and collecting stamps,     
 stickers, rubbers, tins and antiques.
