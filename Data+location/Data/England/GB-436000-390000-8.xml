		<title>08Islamic Mosque, Sheffield</title>
		<content>  Our{mosque}is very big and has two   
 large halls. We have extended the     
 building by installing eight toilets  
 and washrooms. Here we can wash our   
 hands, faces and feet before we pray. 
 There are two smaller rooms facing    
 Mecca where we go without shoes to    
 read our Qur'ans and say our prayers. 
 About 150 men and boys attend our     
 mosque but no women or girls. We are  
 planting a vegetable garden next to   
 the mosque.                           
  During June it was{Ramadan,}all      
 adults and children over 12 years     
 fasted from sunrise until sunset for  
 one month. You couldn't even drink    
 water or put your finger in your      
 mouth. At our mosque the Imam led the 
 prayers about 3am, 2.30pm, 8pm, 9.30pm
 and 11pm during Ramadan.              
  For our Christmas we are given money 
 and new clothes.                      </content>
