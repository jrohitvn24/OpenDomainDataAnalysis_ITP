		<title>02Description of Goonhavern</title>
		<content> I live in the village of Goonhavern.In
 Goonhavern there are two shops,a post 
 office and a cafe.The cafe is called  
 the Forge Cafe,it is called that      
 because it was once a forge.          
   The close I live in is called Rose  
 Meadows.There are lots of people      
 living in the close,like my next door 
 neighbour,James,Matthew and Andrew    
 Frith and their mum and dad.          
   In the village there is also a      
 pottery.The pottery is on a corner not
 far from the close,and I can just see 
 it from my bedroom window.            
   Behind us there is a caravan        
 site,but it is only used as a caravan 
 site in the summer.In the winter it is
 usually used for keeping animals in.  
   At the moment they have got three   
 goats,a young one and two older       
 ones,the two older ones are going to  
 have babies soon.                     </content>
