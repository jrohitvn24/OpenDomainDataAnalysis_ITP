		<content>{Kelham Island Industrial Museum,}     
 situated in a building originally     
 built in 1897 to generate electricity 
 for Sheffield's trams, was opened in  
 1982. It has been developed to show   
 not only the diversity of products    
 made in Sheffield but also to show    
 with exhibits - a variety of tableaux,
 audio-slide displays and films - the  
 story of Sheffield's industrial       
 development.                          
   The most impressive exhibit is the  
{'River Don Engine',}a huge, working   
 steam engine typical of those used to 
 drive the rolling mills in the east of
 the city.                             
   An unusual feature is the inclusion 
 of workshops where three{'Little      
{Mesters'}(a local term for steel      
 craftsmen) can be observed producing  
 some of the specialised products for  
 which Sheffield has become famous.    </content>
