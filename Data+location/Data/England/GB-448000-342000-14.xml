		<title>14   Farming in Strelley</title>
		<content>   A farmer in Strelley says:          
  "Farming has changed greatly. In the 
 old days you could make a living with 
 8 or 10 cows but now you have to keep 
 a large herd. I have 150 dairy cows,  
 plus some beef cattle and a few sheep.
 We grow wheat, barley, oats and       
 potatoes _ just as we used to do. But 
 now there are different varieties. For
 instance, the wheat used to have very 
 long straw, for when we cut with a    
 binder. Now we want wheat with short  
 straw to avoid overloading the combine
 harvester.                            
   We use a lot of fertilisers now such
 as mixtures of potash, phosphate and  
 nitrogen. We also use cow manure and  
 slurry and on the arable land we use a
 lot of Severn-Trent slurry and sludge.
 It's very good for opencast and       
 heather land. But people round about  
 don't like it - because of the smell!"</content>
