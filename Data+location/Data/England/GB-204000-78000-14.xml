		<content> ALTHOUGH SOME OLDER RESIDENTS MAINTAIN
 THAT THE VILLAGE COMMUNITY SPIRIT HAS 
 DIMINISHED OVER THE YEARS, MOST FEEL A
 STRONG SENSE OF BELONGING TO ST. TEATH
 AND APPRECIATE VARIOUS CLUBS, GROUPS  
 AND ACTIVITIES WHICH TAKE PLACE       
 REGULARLY.LOCAL CLUBS INCLUDE:LOCAL   
 HISTORY GROUP;WOMENS INSTITUTE;       
 BADMINTON;SENIOR CITIZENS;            
 PLAYGROUP;OLDE TYME AND MODERN        
 SEQUENCE DANCING;MOTHERS UNION; BRIGHT
 HOUR;FOOTBALL CLUB;ST.TEATH SCHOOL    
 PTA; WHITE HART POOL AND DARTS TEAMS; 
 AND COMMUNITY CENTRE SNOOKER TEAM.    
 HOWEVER,DESPITE THESE MANY ACTIVITIES,
 THERE IS A DISTINCT LACK OF FACILITIES
 IN THE VILLAGE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO   
 HAVE TO TRAVEL TO NEARBY TOWNS FOR    
 THEIR ENTERTAINMENT.A COMMUNITY CENTRE
 HAS BEEN OPENED TO PROVIDE A MEETING  
 PLACE FOR YOUNG AND OLD ALIKE         
 PROVIDING VARIOUS FACILITIES.         </content>
