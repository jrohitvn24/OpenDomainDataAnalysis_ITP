		<title>09A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A VICAR</title>
		<content>  We decided to go and interview the   
 vicar of{Cottingley.}We went down to  
 his house one morning and collected   
 this information: on a typical week   
 day, he gets up at 8.30 and goes to   
 church for his morning prayers. Either
 he or his wife then takes the children
 to school. There are then several     
 things that he might do in the        
 morning: go to meetings; write        
 letters; prepare church services;     
 visit people at home or in hospital;  
 or go shopping for the church and his 
 family. Then together they have lunch.
 After lunch, he usually goes to visit 
 people. One afternoon a week he visits
 local hospitals. Most of the sick     
 patients he visits are too old even to
 talk. In amongst all this, he has to  
 find time to look after the children  
 and his garden.
