 We made a block graph at school to    
 show how our fathers and mothers are  
 employed.In our group of 57 children, 
 we found out that 25 fathers are in   
 the professional group.None of the    
 fathers in our group are              
 unemployed.The next smallest group of 
 fathers are self-employed, 18 fathers 
 have engineering jobs.We found out    
 that there were only 9 fathers who    
 were manual workers.                  
 MOTHERS.                              
 In a group of 56 children we found    
 that 22 mothers are solely housewives 
 and stay at home and 34 mums go out to
 work.
