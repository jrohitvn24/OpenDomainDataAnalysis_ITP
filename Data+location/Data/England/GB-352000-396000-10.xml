		<content> One Saturday I got up at about 1100   
 hrs.I went downstairs,washed my hands 
 and face then my mum made me a drink  
 and some frosties. By then it was 1200
 hrs and I got dressed quickly.A friend
 called for me, we then got all our    
 friends and asked them to have a game 
 of cricket at the park. They agreed so
 we got all our stuff and went. We     
 started to play at about 1300 hrs. We 
 had about 1\hrs of play then we       
 finished and went home for tea.Another
 friend called for me and we decided to
 play golf.I asked my brother to go. We
 went round in the car arriving at 1830
 hrs. We played for 2 hrs because we   
 like it.When we got home I dived in   
 the bath for half an hour. It was 2100
 hrs, I got changed into my sleeping   
 clothes and went to bed thinking about
 what to do tomorrow.By{J.Frodsham}11yr
