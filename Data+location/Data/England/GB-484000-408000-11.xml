		<title>11The Caravan Site.</title>
		<content> I live in a detached house on         
 Parklands Caravan Site. It is a       
 residential site.                     
 On the site there is a little shop    
 which sells peat, plantpots, watering 
 cans, patio slabs and other garden    
 things. There is also a little shop   
 selling gas for the caravans.         
 If you go out of my garden, there is a
 carpark. Behind the carpark there is a
 block of garages.                     
 There are many different kinds of     
 caravans on the site. Some are as     
 large as small bungalows.             
 Behind another block of garages there 
 is a lagoon. This is very attractive  
 to people in hot weather. But, it is  
 very dangerous and people have drowned
 there.                                
 The lagoon has been formed by water   
 draining from Burringham Hill.
