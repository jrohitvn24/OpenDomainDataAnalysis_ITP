		<content>{BUS. }A bus service, operating six    
 days a week, links Newquay with       
 Padstow via Harlyn.  A single bus each
 day goes from Harlyn to Bodmin Parkway
 (main line) Station, and return. There
 is no other rail or road transport.   
{PADSTOW LIFEBOAT of the RNLI.}The Boat
 house (completed 1967) is reached by  
 126 steps on the E side of Trevose    
 Head. The access road is private and  
 locked. Launching is a spectacular    
 operation, via a steep 240ft. slipway.
 The lifeboat, the 'James Burrough' is 
 of Tyne Class, a new 18 knot slipway  
 launching type. Under its now-famous  
 coxswain, Trevor England, the station 
 has a proud history of sea rescues and
 was involved in the Fastnet Race      
 rescues in 1979. Between Jan. and     
 Sept. 1985, the Padstow Lifeboat was  
 emgaged in 12 rescue missions.
