		<content>    At Chain Hill farm pigs are reared.
There are 10 boars and 150 sows.The    
mothers and babies are kept in huts on 
the Downs.                             
 We saw piglets that had been penned in
the yard.Some were 3 weeks old,some 6  
weeks and others were 11 weeks old.The 
farmer sells them when they are 3      
months old.                            
 He showed us the special rolls that he
feeds to the sows.They contain oil,    
protein,fibre, vitamins,molybdenum and 
selenium.The piglets are given special 
small pellets.                         
 We were allowed to stroke a baby pig  
and we sat in a modern tractor.
