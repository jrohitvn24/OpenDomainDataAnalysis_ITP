		<title>13PHEASANTS LITTLE OFFLEY</title>
		<content> The farming at Little Offley is almost
 identical with the work done on the   
 other farms we visited so we selected 
 pheasant rearing as the topic to      
 enquire about,which is a specific     
 interest of the farmer.At the end of  
 the shooting season he catches up a   
 number of pheasants in the ratio of 20
 hens to 3 cocks for the purpose of    
 laying eggs from April onwards.The    
 eggs are  sent to a Game Farmer where 
 they are incubated.They are returned  
 to the farmer as one day chicks and   
 kept in a warm draught-free enclosure 
 within a stable.They are kept on an   
 'electric hen';which is a heated      
 rectangular bed, evenly heated        
 underneath and with a special lamp    
 above.The positioning of the lamp is  
 important;if it is too high the chicks
 will crowd together for warmth and    
 risk suffocation.                     </content>
