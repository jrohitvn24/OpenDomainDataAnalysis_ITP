 cheaper,more relaxing and very        
 reliable.It is also much quicker at   
 rush-hours.He moved here because of   
 the good service the trains provided. 
 The price of a year-ticket{to London  
 from{Rickmansworth}is{Â£648:00,}and

 the last{15 years}he has used it      
 regularly for{9 years}.He gets in the 
 same carriage but does not specially  
 meet anyone.In a survey,{55%}of those
