		<content> Niton Village Hall is the community   
 centre of the village.Situated in the 
 High Street,its central position gives
 easy access and prominence to perform-
 ances  and events given by the various
 organisations.The stone walls of the  
 hall must have been built prior to    
 1762;maintenence work has been an     
 incentive for continuous fund raising 
 efforts from the community.The build- 
 ing has had many uses,but under a     
 Trust in 1936 it became "The Village  
 Hall",administered by villagers for   
 meetings, lectures,classes,and other  
 forms of recreation and leisure-time  
 occupations.Many organisations now    
 use it,including The Wednesday Club   
 for Senior Citizens,Niton Football    
 Club,the Horticultural Society, the   
 Drama Club and the Women's Institute. 
 Other activities include Bingo,Whist  
 Drives and Art and Dancing Classes.   </content>
