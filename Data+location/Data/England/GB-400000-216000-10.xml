		<title>10The Medieval Mill</title>
		<content>    When William the Conqueror ordered 
 the great Doomsday Survey of England  
 in 1086 there was a mill on the site  
 of the present hotel called the       
 Frogmill. The mill was valued at 10   
 shillings at the time of the          
 Conqueror. In Medieval England a      
 peasant was not allowed to grind his  
 own corn but had to bring his corn to 
 the manorial mill to be ground by the 
 miller, who was a servant of the Lord 
 of the Manor. In early Medieval days  
 the miller took one twentieth part of 
 the corn he ground for the Lord of the
 Manor and this formed a valuable part 
 of the income of the Manor and so the 
 life of the village depended on the   
 mill.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
