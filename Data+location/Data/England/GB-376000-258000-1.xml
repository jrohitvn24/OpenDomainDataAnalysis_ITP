		<content>{Wichenford}is a small village of 483  
 people about 7 miles out of Worcester.
{Castle Hill}was the village centre,   
 but{Council Houses}were built to the  
 north after the war, and the village  
 moved to its present site.            
 The main land-holder,{Colonel Britten 
 lives at{Wichenford Court,}a manor    
 dating back to the 13th century.      
 This is a farming area, presenting a  
 peaceful rural scene of gentle hills, 
 lush fields, coppices, and orchards.  
 The{village}lost its school in 1970   
 when the younger population fell, and 
 today the building houses a day-      
 centre for the aged and handicapped.  
{St Laurence Church}now shares a vicar;
 and the only shops are a{Post Office, 
 a{Bakery}and the{Pub.                 
 Bounded by{Bulmers' orchards, Laughern
{Hill, Kenswick Manor and fruit fields,
 it is a beautiful, quietly busy area. </content>
