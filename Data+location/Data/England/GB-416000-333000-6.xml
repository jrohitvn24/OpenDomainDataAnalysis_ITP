		<content> SOUTH &amp; SOUTH EAST,THE LAND FALLS 29M.
 IN 4 KM.TOWARDS THE SOUTH EAST THE    
 LAND UNDULATES SLIGHTLY,AND THERE ARE 
 ALSO VALLEYS WITH STREAMS IN THEM.    
{SETTLEMENTS}MOST OF THE SETTLEMENTS   
 AROUND BOYLESTONE ARE SINGLE FARMS,   
 FOR EXAMPLE HAREHILL FARM,OR SINGLE   
 LARGE HOUSES.THESE ARE DISPERSED      
 THROUGHOUT THE LOCATION.THE VILLAGE OF
 BOYLESTONE ITSELF IS THE MAJOR        
 SETTLEMENT OF THE DISTRICT.THIS IS    
 NUCLEATED ALTHOUGH THE POST OFFICE AND
 PUBLIC HOUSE ARE SEPARATED FROM THE   
 REST OF THE VILLAGE,BEING SITUATED TO 
 THE SOUTH WEST AND LINKED TO THE      
 VILLAGE BY A MINOR ROAD.THERE IS A    
 LINEAR DISTRIBUTION TOWARDS MACKELEY  
 HOUSE.OVERALL WE CAN SAY THAT THE     
 DISTRIBUTION OF SETTLEMENT IS FAIRLY  
 REGULAR,ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO          
 SETTLEMENT AROUND THE STREAMS IN THE  
 SOUTH EAST.TOWARDS THE SOUTH WEST     </content>
