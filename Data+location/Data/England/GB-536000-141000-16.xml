		<content> There is also a new cafe open most of 
 the time selling a lovely selection of
 home_made cakes and biscuits as well  
 as the usual crisps and sweets.       
 Freshly made coffee and tea is also   
 available.                            
   Whilst we were there we did a survey
 of visiting 'pickers' and in one hour 
 30 people had come and gone and, all  
 of them with the exception of one,    
 came to pick strawberries.
