		<title>20A DAY IN THE LIFE OF GUY</title>
		<content> My name is Guy Simpson.I get up in the
 morning at 7.10a.m. I have a wash and 
 watch Popeye on TVa.m. At 7.30 I get  
 dressed and have some muslei breakfast
 cereal.I pop to the shop for a packet 
 of crisps,pack my things,and leave for
 school at 8.35.On the way to school   
 I have a chat with my step-brother    
 Keith.                                
  After the bell we have assembly which
 is sometimes a bit boring but mostly  
 its interesting.We do Ginn maths and  
 then have dinner.I prefer tea to      
 dinner,school dinners are horrible!   
 There is too much salt in the mashed  
 potato,the chips are soggy and the    
 peas are watery.After dinner I play   
 with my best friend Zuber.School      
 finishes at 3.45. For tea I have      
 egg,bacon and bread.Then I help Dad   
 with the pigeons,watch some television
 and get ready for bed at 8.00 p.m.    </content>
