		<title>06      CHAMBERCOMBE</title>
		<content> This is a very old part of Ilfracombe 
 and was mentioned in the first        
 Domesday Book.It takes its name from  
 an owner of Chambercombe Manor called 
 Sir Henry Champernon.Once this area   
 was all farmland,but as Ilfracombe    
 became more popular as a seaside      
 resort,it developed into a residential
 area and is still developing.The      
 children are very noisy and play in   
 the street.This disturbs the old age  
 pensioners who have lived in these    
 parts a long time.The roads are packed
 with parked cars as most of the houses
 do not have garages.The dustbin bags  
 are put out on Thursday night,by      
 Friday morning the rubbish is all over
 the place,because the bags have been  
 ripped up by cats,dogs and seagulls.  
 There is a garage where cars and      
 trucks are mended.The fumes from it   
 are terrible.                         </content>
