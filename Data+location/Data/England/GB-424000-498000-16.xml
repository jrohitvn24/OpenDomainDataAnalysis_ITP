   In Scorton there are two small      
 shops.Both sell all kinds of food, and
 one has a post office.The shop called 
 Mace,overlooking the village green, is
 open from half past eight in the      
 morning until half past five, but on  
 Sundays only from eleven until twelve 
 o'clock.The owner,Mr.Rawling, is      
 always there and three other people   
 take turns to help him.               
                                       
 SHOPPING FROM A CATALOGUE             
   We usually get clothes, shoes and   
 sometimes toys out of the catalogue.  
 A man comes round every Monday and he 
 writes down the order.You can pay him 
 off at once but this is hard if you   
 order something expensive.Mum pays it 
 off bit by bit, so she is always      
 paying him.                           </content>
