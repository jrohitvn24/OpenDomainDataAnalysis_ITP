		<title>07Wave Reflection Wall 2.</title>
		<content> Phases 1 and 2 of the sea wall were   
 constructed between 1982 and 1984 and 
 stretched from Happy Mount Park to the
 Town Hall. The contractors were       
 Harbour and General Ltd. and the 2    
 phases cost Â£931,300, 6 men were      
 employed on site. Concrete was        
 supplied by a Ready Mix concrete      
 supplier. The wall was built on the   
 promenade side of the existing wall   
 and is designed as a secondary line of
 defence. The main sea wall is still   
 the first line. The new wall is       
 described as a wave reflection wall   
 and its job is to turn back the mass  
 of green water that surges unchecked  
 over the main wall. The main wall     
 absorbs the initial energy of the sea.
 Any water spilling on to the promenade
 is returned to the sea by the         
 Reflection Wall. the wall is curved to
 enable this to happen.                </content>
