		<content> Timber is thinned by a 4 wheel drive  
 tractor and winch.                    
 The Forestry Commission permits Silton
 Forest to be used for walking,        
 orienteering,car rallying,motor cycle 
 trials,shooting,foxhunting,horse      
 riding and picnics.                   
 The spruce is used for pulping to make
 paper;scots pine thinnings are used   
 for fencing stakes and bigger saw logs
 are used for construction work.       
 Patrols go round the forest every 14  
 days to spot fires.They rely on the   
 public and the fire brigade for help  
 too.A special type of foam which is   
 cheap and easy to use has been        
 developed to help in fire fighting.It 
 forms a barrier to the flames.        
 All the men are equipped properly with
 helmets,earmuffs,visors,leggings,pads 
 and gloves.The men are working nights 
 to cope with the demand for timber.   </content>
