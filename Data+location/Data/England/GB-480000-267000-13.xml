		<content>As Sywell is a country area it is      
fortunate in having a rich wild life.  
Small rodents, grey squirrels, foxes,  
rabbits, weasels, stoats, muntjac deer 
common frogs, toads, newts and even    
grass snakes can be seen or their      
tracks found.                          
There is a very varied selection of    
birds. During a survey of bird visitors
to the School bird table 14 different  
types were recorded: house sparrow,    
dunnock, robin, blue tit, great tit,   
starling, chaffinch, greenfinch, bull  
finch, blackbird, thrush, collared     
dove, wood pigeon, pied wagtail.       
Swallows are annual visitors to the    
Rectory  Stables. Many other species   
can be seen in the farmland.           
A colony of bats uses the church as a  
roosting place (and cafeteria!) at the 
same season each year. Polythene sheets
are necessary to cover the altar!      </content>
