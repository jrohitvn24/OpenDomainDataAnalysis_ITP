		<title>15Edingale Village Hall</title>
		<content>       In the centre of the village of 
Edingale is the Village Hall. It is a  
modern building erected about 10 years 
ago to replace an older, smaller and   
less substantial hall. The original    
hall  was situated on the corner of    
Croxall Road and Moorescroft. The new  
hall is near this site but further     
away from Croxall Road.                
       The Village Hall is the         
general meeting place for many village 
organisations such as the Brownies and 
the Badminton Club.Discos, dances and  
concerts take place there and it is    
also available for hire for private    
functions.                             
      On one side of the hall there is 
a car park and on the west side there  
is a large grassed area used for       
recreation such as cricket and         
football.A childrens playground has    
been recently constructed.             </content>
