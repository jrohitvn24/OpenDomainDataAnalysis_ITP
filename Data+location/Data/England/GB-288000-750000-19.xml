		<title>19A Parish Minister's Day</title>
		<content> I do not have any{typical working day!
 They are all different and            
 unpredictable. People take ill and the
 undertaker telephones me to tell me   
 about a funeral and my planned        
 schedule is disrupted. However, some  
 things do recur regularly. There is a 
 good deal of business to be done for  
 the Congregational Board and the Kirk 
 Session.I also have to keep in touch  
 with{Presbytery and National Church   
 business.I try to do paperwork in the 
 mornings,and that includes preparation
 of services.I have 30 t0 40 functions 
 to attend to per month, services,     
 including weddings and funerals,      
 committee meetings and many church    
 organisations. In between that work I 
 visit my parishioners and the local   
 hospitals and caring Homes.This does  
 not leave much time for{family}or     
 hobbies. {by Rev.Irene B.Miller.      </content>
