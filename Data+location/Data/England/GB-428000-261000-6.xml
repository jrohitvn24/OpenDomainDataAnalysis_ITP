      Most noticeable on the {Heathcote
{Industrial Estate}is the 'Books For   
 Students' building which is most      
 striking in colour and design.It is   
 50,000 sq.ft. in area and has taken   
 one hundred workmen about 14 months   
 to complete at a cost of Â£800,000.It  
 is made with a steel framework and    
 glass insulation boards. The firm     
 started in Surrey and came to L.Spa   
 ten years ago.                        
      Other firms include Henderson's  
 (garage doors),Machsize Ltd (measure- 
 ment and inspection technology),Axis  
 Plant Hire and a number of light      
 industrial firms.There are also a     
 number of warehousing and storage     
 facilities for companies.             
     {Europa Way}was built to improve  
 access to the site and more roads are 
 being planned for the near future.    </content>
