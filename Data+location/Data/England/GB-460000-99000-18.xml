      Here we saw the remains of gun   
 emplacements and in some, the original
 gun swivels. At ground level are the  
 'magazines' and 'powder stores' which 
 can still be seen. There is also a    
 caponier, a type of outer defence. At 
 the base of{The Ramparts}is the Moat  
 and the water level is controlled by a
 sluice gate.                          
     {The Lines}could be a very        
 attractive place to visit but we were 
 horified to see that state they were  
 in. There was litter all around us and
 people have used The Moat as a dump.  
 There was evidence of vandalism;      
 damage to{The Ramparts}because people 
 will not use the steps, carvings on   
 the trees and even a 'Tarzan' swing.  
 We felt we needed to bring this       
 situation to the notice of the        
 Council.                              </content>
