		<title>01THE VILLAGE OF GILBERDYKE</title>
		<content>{      }                               
                                       
 The village of Gilberdyke in the late 
 1970's was by-passed by the M62       
 motorway. This reduced the heavy flow 
 of continuous commercial traffic      
 moving to and from Hull.              
                                       
 Originally a farming and agricultural 
 community this village has changed    
 greatly over the years. Recent        
 housing development has trebled the   
 population over six years, turning    
 Gilberdyke into a dormitory town for  
 Hull.                                 
                                       
 Gilberdyke is served by a busy        
 shopping precinct, light industry and 
 other commercial concerns have        
 developed to provide employment within
 the village, replacing much of the    
 traditional agricultural employment.  </content>
