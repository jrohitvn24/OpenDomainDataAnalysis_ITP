 Continued                             
 In the latter part of the 1970s the   
 school was to have become a First     
 School taking children from five to   
 eight years. Several changes were made
 to the school for this change, such as
 the fitting of carpets in the         
 classrooms and the building of indoor 
 toilets, but it has recently been     
 decided to keep the school as a five  
 to eleven Primary School.             
 It has been suggested by the the      
 Norfolk Education Authority that      
 schools with less than sixty          
 childrenshould be closed. Since the   
 school falls into this category then  
 its future is rather uncertain.
