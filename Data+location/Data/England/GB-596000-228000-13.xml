		<content>  ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES         
   OF LIVING IN THE COUNTRY            
    AS SEEN BY TWO TWELVE              
       YEAR OLD GIRLS                  
                                       
 ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES OF LIVING IN THE
 COUNTRY IS THAT YOU CAN GO OUT FOR    
 NICE QUIET WALKS.WHEN YOU ARE OUT FOR 
 WALKS,YOU CAN SEE LOTS OF WILDLIFE.   
  ONE OF THE DISADVANTAGES IS THAT     
 THERE ARE NOT VERY MANY SHOPS;THERE IS
 ONLY ONE AND THAT IS A GREENGROCERS.  
 ANOTHER DISADVANTAGE,IS THAT THERE IS 
 NOT ANYTHING FOR TEENAGERS TO DO IN   
 THE EVENINGS,LIKE YOUTH CLUBS.        
 ANOTHER DISADVANTAGE IS THAT THERE ARE
 NOT ANY PLAYGROUNDS OR PARKS IN THE   
 COUNTRY,FOR YOUNGER CHILDREN TO PLAY  
 IN.THERE IS NO B.M.X TRACK FOR        
 EXAMPLE.                              
  HOWEVER,I LIKE LIVING IN THE COUNTRY
