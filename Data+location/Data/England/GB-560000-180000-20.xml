		<title>20Little Wellhouse Farm (cont)</title>
		<content>        The farm has been effectively  
 divided into two by the opening of the
 new A13 by-pass.The main change to the
 family has been a significant increase
 in noise level.The crops that are     
 grown remain basically the same ie    
 wheat and barley.                     
         Stables and working horses    
 were once a feature of this farm,but  
 at present there are no animals at all
 with the exception of a pet alsatian. 
          The farmer is fairly self    
 sufficient by tending to a sizeable   
 vegetable plot.He grows potatoes ,    
 parsnips,runner beans,cabbages and    
 tomatoes.However,none of these        
 products are sold as the farmer has   
 concentrated on producing just enough 
 to meet the family needs.
