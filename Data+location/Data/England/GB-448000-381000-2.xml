		<title>02SOUTH ANSTON</title>
		<content>   South Anston is separated from North
 Anston by the A57 main road and Anston
 Brook. In recent years it has grown   
 from a 19th century quarrying village 
 to a small town with a number of      
 large, private housing estates. Very  
 few people actually work in the       
 village and the closeness of the M1   
 motorway means that some people travel
 long distances to work.               
   Most families have at least one car 
 but there are regular bus services to 
 Sheffield, Rotherham, Worksop and     
 Dinnington. There is also a train     
 service to Sheffield from Kiveton.    
   Many inhabitants have moved out from
 Sheffield. Others are employed in     
 professional jobs that mean frequent  
 moves so there is quite a high        
 turnover of population. The old       
 village has been almost swamped by new
 building and its character changed.   </content>
