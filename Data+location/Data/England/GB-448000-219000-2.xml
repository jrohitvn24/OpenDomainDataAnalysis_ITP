		<title>02History of Kirtlington part1</title>
		<content>Local History- The name Kirtlington is 
thought to originate from CYRTLALINGTON
meaning "The town of Cyrtla's people", 
Cyrtla presumably being a tribal chief.
Kirtlington was originally in the      
counties of Wessex/Mercia. In Roman    
times Kirtlington was a place of great 
importance having two Roman roads,     
Akeman Street which crossed the Portway
(now the Heyford Road). Roman camps    
were nearby. Traces of Avesditch (ash  
bank or wattle bank) still remain and  
this was probably a line of            
fortification and a  boundary. In the  
Domesday Survey of 1086 Kirtlington is 
described as a Royal Manor, and        
mention is made of tolls which were    
paid. It is not certain who the first  
owners of Kirtlington Manor (actually  
in Northbrook) were although it is     
likely that Robert D'Oyly, Governor    
of Oxford held a great part of it.     </content>
