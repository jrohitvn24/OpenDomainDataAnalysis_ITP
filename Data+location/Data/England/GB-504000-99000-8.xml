   Littlehampton Swimming Centre is    
 situated alongside Mewsbrook Park and 
 was opened in 1983 by Princess        
 Alexandra. The Centre is run for the  
 community by Arun District Council and
 has a main pool, a shallow pool, three
 squash courts, a health and fitness   
 suite, meeting room and refreshment   
 area. The main pool roof is shaped    
 like an upturned boat. The shallow    
 pool with steps and a ramp is for     
 learners, young children and the      
 handicapped. Both pools have deck-    
 level sides and ozone water           
 purification. The Centre organises    
 lessons for all ages and has special  
 fun/sessions with inflatables. You can
 also learn canoeing, windsurfing and  
 snorkelling.

 Centre received over 600,000 visits.  </content>
