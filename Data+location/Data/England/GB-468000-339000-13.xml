		<title>13WALLENFELS - TWIN TOWN</title>
		<content>    Charters of friendship joining the 
 towns of Bingham and Wallenfels       
 (Bavaria) were signed in 1984. The    
 main purpose in signing such an       
 agreement is to encourage friendship, 
 peace and goodwill. People of all ages
 and occupations should be involved,   
 become friends and understand each    
 other's points of view.               
    Wallenfels is an attractive small  
 town in the Franconian Forest.        
 Everyone who has paid a visit to      
 Bavaria has commented on the          
 friendliness and the hospitality as   
 well as the welcome that they         
 received. Strong friendships have     
 already been made between the children
 of Bingham and the twin town through  
 exchange visits between the two.
