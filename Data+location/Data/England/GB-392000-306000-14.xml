		<title>14HAVERGAL SCHOOL</title>
		<content>This Church of England school was built
in l872 and named after Frances Ridley 
Havergal,the hymnwriter,who lived in   
the village in the l86Os.Her hymn "Take
my life and let it be" has been adopted
as the school hymn.The four houses of  
the school are named after prominent   
local families,Vernon,Swynnerton,      
Giffard and Havergal.The school was    
built to educate children of all ages, 
but has served as a first school for   
children of 5 to 9 years since the     
introduction of the "three-tier        
system". The catchment area covers a 2 
mile radius, but falling school rolls  
have occasioned a policy change and    
from Autumn l986 the age range will be 
5 to ll years.The older children from  
Calf Heath and Shareshill are taken by 
coach to the High School at Cheslyn    
Hay.
