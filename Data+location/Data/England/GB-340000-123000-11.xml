		<content> Once ,when I went to open an upstairs 
 window one of the large family        
 portraits fell down beside me!The     
 cord had  frayed and finally snapped  
 through old age.There is a visitors'  
 book which every guest signs.The only 
 famous person I met while working     
 there was Roddy Llwellyn who stayed   
 there for a weekend.I met many titled 
 people whom I found to be most        
 friendly.I was supposed to call       
 everyone sir or madam,the sir I could 
 manage but I'm afraid the madam stuck 
 in my throat.I used to clean the      
 family silver once a week and I       
 enjoyed handling  the beautiful       
 silver.The furniture was lovely to    
 polish,my favourite being the old     
 refectory table in the hall.There used
 to be an extensive staff,but no       
 more,just 1 daily help and a gardener 
 once a week.                          </content>
