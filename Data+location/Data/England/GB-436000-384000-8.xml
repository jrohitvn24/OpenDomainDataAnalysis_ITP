		<content>    It is quite common to find the     
 names of local Football Teams on      
 walls. Names of boyfriends or         
 girlfriends are popular too.          
                                       
    Messages ar written usually in     
 marker pen or paint from a spray can. 
 Other pens, pencil, chalk are         
 sometimes used. Some people even      
 scratch their messages on.            
                                       
    The subways have become so covered 
 in untidy scribble recently that local
 schools have started to paint pictures
 on the bare concrete walls of the     
 subway to make them more attractive   
 and interesting. They hope children   
 will not vandalise the place so much  
 if they have pictures of cartoon      
 characters, road vehicles, film stars,
 musicians etc.
