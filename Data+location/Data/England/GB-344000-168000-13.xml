 affecting its life;-                  
{Nailsea Town Council}which decides on 
 matters of local concern such as      
 playing fields, footpaths, rights of  
 way etc. It meets at the Town Council 
 Offices just off the High Street. It  
 works closely with, or disagrees      
 with....                              
{Woodspring District Council}which     
 governs such things as leisure        
 facilities, main street lighting, town
 planning etc. It meets in the old Town
 Hall of Weston-super-mare. It works   
 closely with, or disagrees with.....  
{Avon County Council}(or the{County of 
{Avon}as it prefers to be known) which 
 decides on such matters as education, 
 highways, area planning etc..         
 Avon County was formed in 1974 and is 
 unpopular with a minority in Nailsea  
 who'd prefer to be part of{Somerset!  </content>
