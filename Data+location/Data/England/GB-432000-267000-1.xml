		<content>{Lillington}has a lot of features like 
 the housing estates. There are lots of
 them and there are flats in Eden      
 Court. They are called Eden Court     
 after Sir Anthony Eden who was once   
 Prime Minister of England and our     
 local MP. There is also the old part  
 of Lillington and three churches, the 
 free church, Mary Magdelen, and a     
 Catholic church by the library. There

 things for everyday needs. There are

 There are some big events which are   
 held at the Campion Hills. Some BMX   
 teams from Coventry &amp; Birmingham come 
 to the Campion Hills to take part in  
 the BMX racing. Aswell as the BMX     
 racing there are two more events      
 which come once a year. They are the  
 fair and the circus. They attract     
 people from Warwick &amp; Leamington.     </content>
