		<title>10 LYNNBOTTOM DUMP 1</title>
		<content>    These days our society is a        
 throwaway society: because of this    
 there are great problems in getting   
 rid of all the rubbish.  The          
 Lynnbottom dump covers about 20 acres 
 and it is positioned approximately    
 2.5km East of Newport.  The dump deals
 with 70,000 tonnes of rubbish a       
 year,50,000 tonnes of rubble and earth
 and 15,000 tonnes of paper which is   
 collected from the civic community    
 compound.  The refuse lorries from    
 Bembridge,Sandown,Shanklin,Yarmouth   
 and Shalfleet all go to Lynnbottom    
 dump.                                 
    The dump has been there for about  
 15 years and is only expected to last 
 2_3 years until it is completely full.
 Before the dump was built it was a    
 copse with a river running through    
 it.
