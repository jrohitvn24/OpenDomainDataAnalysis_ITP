		<title>12EMPLOYMENT IN ABBOTSKERSWELL</title>
		<content> We did a survey in our primary school 
 to see where the mothers and fathers  
 work. Most of the fathers (28%) work  
 in Newton Abbot.Quite a lot of the    
 fathers work in Paignton and Torquay  
 (11%) in each and 2% of the fathers   
 are unemployed.                       
 Half of the mothers are housewives.   
 19% of them work in Newton Abbot.     
 16% of them work in Abbotskerswell.   
 Other parents work in other centres   
 and some move around, e.g.district    
 nurses.                               
 Unemployment generally in the area is 
 over 13% in mid 1985 and we think the 
 reason our sample shows less is       
 because most of our parents are in    
 their thirties and our survey did not 
 include younger or older people.      
 Very few parents work in the village  
 and so it has a very great role as    
 a dormitory community.                </content>
