		<title>16COINAGEHALL STREET (2)</title>
		<content> In 1810 the building was demolished.  
 The name Coinagehall Street is derived
 from this original hall. Originally   
 the street was known as {Lady Street} 
 after the Chapel of Our Lady which    
 once stood at its lower end.          
      Leading up from Coinagehall      
 Street is Wendron Street where {Bob   
{Fitzsimmons}was born on May 26th 1863.
 He was the Middleweight boxing        
 champion of the world in 1891. He went
 on to become the Heavyweight champion 
 of the world between 1897-9.          
      To commemorate his achievement   
 as Britain's only world heavyweight   
 boxing champion a pub was named after 
 him in Coinagehall Street.
