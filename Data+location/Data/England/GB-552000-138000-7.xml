		<title>07FARMING</title>
		<content>   The farms around Langton Green and  
 Fordcombe vary in size between about  
 20 and 140 hectares. Most of them go  
 in for mixed farming, with cereal and 
 livestock, but there are also two     
 dairy herds. Some farms also grow     
 potatoes and raise chickens.          
   Some of the farms are worked by the 
 owner while others are run by a farm  
 manager. None have more than four     
 labourers to assist them.             
   All the farms own tractors and a    
 large number of mechanical accessories
 such as: Combine Harvesters, Balers   
 and Cultivators. Very little of the   
 work is done by hand.                 
   Most fields are comparatively small 
 when compared with places such as East
 Anglia or the Cotswolds and have      
 either retained their old hedges,     
 often of hawthorn, or are fenced with 
 mesh and/or barbed wire.              </content>
