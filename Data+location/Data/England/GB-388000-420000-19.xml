		<title>19BMX &amp; Football - Shawforth</title>
		<content>   There are lots of places in         
 Shawforth where you can go on your    
 bike and ride a trials track.         
 Sometimes we make jumps on a stretch  
 of ground called the orange track.    
 This is the site where the old railway
 line used to run and it gets its name 
 from the colour of the soil. The track
 is used during Whitworth Sports       
 Festival for a BMX trial and people   
 from all over our area take part. Lots
 of people around here have BMX bikes. 
   Primary schools in this area play   
 Seven-a-Side Football in leagues and  
 Five-a-Side Football in tournaments.  
 Schools are put into leagues based on 
 the number of boys there are in the   
 juniors, and their geographical       
 location. With schools being spread   
 over a wide area you might have to    
 travel many miles to play matches.
