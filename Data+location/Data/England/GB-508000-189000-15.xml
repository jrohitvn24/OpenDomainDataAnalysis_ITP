		<title>15NEIGHBOURHOOD WATCH</title>
		<content> My brother and myself generally do not
 get on very well,but I think the main 
 cause of that is because I have the   
 smallest bedroom.My parents get on    
 with all our neighbours and my mum    
 freqently writes to one of her closest
 friends who at the moment is living in
 Kenya.In the road that I live in,many 
 parents have set up a Neighbourhood   
 Watch Scheme to try and prevent local 
 burglaries.My Dad goes to special     
 meetings held by the Metropolitan     
 police about the Neighbourhood Watch  
 Scheme.These are normaly held at      
 Bishop Ramsay school on friday        
 evenings.Across the road from where I 
 live is a house that is rented by     
 college graduates.No-one really gets  
 on with them because they park their  
 cars infront of everybodys houses and 
 sometimes their driveways.
