		<content> The only classified road to enter the 
 area is the B6318, which goes from    
 Gilsland to Langholm.This road passes 
 through the south-west corner of our  
 rectangle.From that road two other    
 lanes lead off, one to Newcastleton,  
 over the Scottish border, and the     
 other,a cul-de-sac, ends at the Flatt,
 a large farm.Between these roads are  
 several old tracks, joining farms and 
 once providing routeways for horses   
 and pedestrians.Where these tracks    
 approach rivers they often need       
 fords to cross, with footbridges or   
 stepping stones for walkers.          
      The roads have good surfaces for 
 they have little traffic , livestock  
 on the road being the main hazard     
 except for Winter weather which       
 occasionally causes problems.
