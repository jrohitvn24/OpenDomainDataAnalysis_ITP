		<content>   The twelve square block 03880228    
 lies just South of the market town of 
 Tewkesbury in the{Severn Vale}to the  
 East of the River Severn and some four
 miles to the West of the Cotswold     
 Hills. This flat, low-lying area is   
 agricuturally picturesque with its    
 patchwork landscape given over to     
 cereal, crops and pasture land for    
 dairy cattle and sheep.               
  There are three small{villages       
 serving this sparsely populated area: 
 Tredington, which occupies a central  
 position; Deerhurst Walton in the     
 South West and the Western outskirts  
 of Stoke Orchard which lies to the    
 South East.                           
   The{agricultural land}is shared     
 between nine farms and the only sign  
 of industrial development is the Coal 
 Research Depot at Stoke Orchard.
