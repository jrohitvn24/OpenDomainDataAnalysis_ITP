Houses were built in                   
bricks and wood in 1985.               
The bricks made the walls              
and the wood makes the roof.           
Houses today have different            
names like flats,maisonettes,          
and bungalows,tower blocks             
and cottages.

maisonette has as many as              
two or three floors.

and my nan lives on the first          
floor.The windows are made out         
of glass and the window pane           
wasw made of wood and the doors        
are made of wood,and the windows       
are made of glass.
