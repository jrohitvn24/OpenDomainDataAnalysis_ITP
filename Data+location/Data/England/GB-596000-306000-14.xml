		<title>14THE FLOWER FESTIVAL</title>
		<content> The theme of the 3 day exhibition at  
 the local church was{'All Things      
{Bright and Beautiful'}and was in aid  
 of the church restoration fund. The   
 festival is organised bi-annually by  
 local volunteers led by a committee of
 4 ladies. Planning for the show had   
 been underway since March. The        
 thousands of blooms on display were   
 arranged by various members of the    
 community including the Girl Guides   
 and the Young Wives' Group.Much of the
 estimated Â£200 cost (of the flowers)  
 had been met from the proceeds of     
 coffee mornings and evenings.         
 Villagers had also donated flowers    
 such as gladioli, carnations and      
 lupins from their own gardens. It took
 those involved at least 4 days'       
 preparation to set up the show. The   
 event attracted approximately 1000    
 visitors.                             </content>
