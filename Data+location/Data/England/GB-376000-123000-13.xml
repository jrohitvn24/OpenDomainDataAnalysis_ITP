		<title>13Village Wartime Memories.</title>
		<content> 'George' Burgess remembers with pride 
 the A.R.P.warden plaque on his gate at
 West Stour.He recalls the day the     
 London evacuees arrived,primary age   
 children with two teachers.Their      
 lessons were held in the schoolroom of
 Ashley House and in the village school
 which by then was the village hall.His
 daughter tells of the year when a     
 Christmas present from the Sunday     
 School was a gas mask case. Memories  
 too of Italian prisoners of war living
 in two cottages in the village and    
 working at Manor Farm. The village    
 green has a momento of the first world
 war, a large shell lying on its side. 
 George recalls how it was taken away  
 in the second world war, along with   
 some iron railings, to be used as     
 scrap metal to help the war effort.
