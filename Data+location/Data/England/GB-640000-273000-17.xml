		<title>17Families - Cathy</title>
		<content>My name is Cathy Block and I live near 
the heath in Blackheath. I have a      
brother who is 5 years old - I am 7.   
My dad is a printer and he works in    
Halesworth. I have lots of cousins who 
live in London, Halesworth and         
Wenhaston.                             
I get up at 7 o'clock and I get myself 
dressed and have breakfast. I like     
Weetabix with milk. After breakfast I  
get ready for school. If the weather is
bad, Mummy takes me in the camper, but 
if not, we walk. When I get to school, 
I do my work - I like it. My favourite 
is reading. We go out to play at half  
past ten. We have 15 minutes break. At 
12 o'clock we have our dinner. School  
ends at a quarter past three.          
We go on our holidays in our camper.   
This year we went to Belgium, France,  
Switzerland and Germany. I help Mum    
cook the food, but I like shopping too.</content>
