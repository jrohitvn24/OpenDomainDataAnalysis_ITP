		<content>  People come to this area for their   
 holidays in the summer.  The families 
 of three children in our school have  
 holiday cottages which they let, two  
 have caravan areas on their land and  
 one takes in people for bed and       
 breakfast.                            
 The charges vary, but it costs about  
 Â£100 a week to rent a cottage, Â£1 a   
 night for a caravan, and Â£6.50 a night
 for an adult staying for bed and      
 breakfast.   Every two years a caravan
 club comes to one of our farms, and   
 then there are about thirty caravans  
 on the site.                          
 Across the road from our school is a  
 large building called the Koppers.    
 It used to be a three star hotel, but 
 has closed down this year and is going
 to be an old people's home.
