		<content> The Bear Inn Hotel is a remarkable    
 black and white half-timbered house,  
 dating back to the 16th Century.  It  
 stands opposite the Hundred House at  
 the junction of the A53 and A442.     
 The Landlord and Landlady of the Inn  
 are Mr.Brian  McCarthy and his wife   
 Catherine.                            
 Inside, a warm welcome is felt from   
 the log fires and there is free top-  
 class entertainment. Medieval Banquets
 are held in the upstairs banqueting   
 hall.  This will hold 80 people and is
 also used for Birthday Parties and    
 Weddings.   Good food is always served
 there and on sunny days, tables and   
 chairs are provided for outdoor       
 drinks.                               
 There is a large carpark at the rear. 
 There is a story that a secret tunnel 
 links the Hotel with St.Luke's        
 Church.                        A.A.B. </content>
