		<title>13RECREATION IN LYTHE</title>
		<content> The most common recreational pastime  
 is gardening.This is obvious from the 
 many well kept gardens attached to    
 most of the houses and also from the  
 magnificent vegetables etc. displayed 
 in the local show. Other popular      
 interests are the Women's Institute   
 and its various activities,the Young  
 Farmers Club. There are many          
 individual interests such as swimming,
 dancing,needlecraft,quoits playing,   
 golf,fishing and those who do         
 voluntary social work.Some of the     
 younger villagers are encouraged to   
 go cycling through the club organised 
 by the vicar.
