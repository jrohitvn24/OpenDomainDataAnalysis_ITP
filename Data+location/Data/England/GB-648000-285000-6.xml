		<content> The villages of Henstead &amp; Rushmere   
 lie on either side of the river       
 Hundred which reaches the sea at      
 Benacre. An overall picture of this   
 area is a very attractive one with    
 large expanses of farm land           
 interrupted by small copses, beautiful
 hedgerows and winding country roads.  
 The countryside is mostly flat but it 
 undulates softly down towards the A12 
 and on the B1127 just past Henstead   
 Church. Climatically this area has had
 24" annual rain for the past 7 years. 
 The trend is to have 2 months of heavy
 rainfall followed by 6 weeks of dry.In
 the last 10 years spring has been a   
 monty later and colder, summers have  
 been hotter and longer, making autumn 
 shorter.Farmers believe we could be   
 heading for a mini ice age due to the 
 gradual drop in sea temperature. Mist 
 and fog are common.                   </content>
