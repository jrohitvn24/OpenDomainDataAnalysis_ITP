		<title>13Favourite foods and Pop</title>
		<content>We did a survey on food. What we did   
was chose some food which were chips,  
icecream, baked beans, sausages,       
potatoes, fish fingers, bacon and beef 
burgers. We went the junior part of our
school which is Greysbrooke C.P. School
and asked each class which food is     
their favourite and out of the four    
classes their favourite food is        
icecream which has a total of 32       
people the second was chips with 26    
people and the third was beefburgers   
15. We did a survey on pop groups. The 
favourite group is Wham. I do not like 
most pop groups because of what they   
wear and sometimes because of what     
they sing. The second was Duran Duran  
and the third Go West. My favourite    
song was the Frog Chorus by Paul       
McCartny which was about Rupert and    
some frogs. Rupert is in a dream world 
and lots of things  happen.            </content>
