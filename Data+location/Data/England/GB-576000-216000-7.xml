		<content>    For a fairly small village there   
 are a lot of clubs and societies in   
 White Notley. It is not possible to   
 record them all here but many of them 
 are based in the Village Hall.        
    There are several sporting clubs   
 including Table Tennis, Badminton and 
 Football. The Youth Football club     
 recently closed down because of a     
 shortage of players. The main Football
 Club is very successful and has built 
 a very good new pavilion and changing 
 rooms over the past two years.        
    Other groups include the Women's   
 Institute, the Mothers Union and the  
 301 Club. Most of these groups meet   
 each month and have guest speakers to 
 talk to them about a variety of       
 different subjects.                   
    Representatives of these groups    
 come together as the Village Hall     
 committee.                            </content>
