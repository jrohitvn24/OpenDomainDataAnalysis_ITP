		<title>07HOBBIES AND RECREATION</title>
		<content>Hobbies are very popular in the area of
Garstang.On Thursday 25th June 1985 a  
survey was carried out in the centre of
town.A cross section of people were    
asked with the assistance of a tape    
recorder.Each person was asked if they 
had a hobby? Quite a number of people  
had more than one hobby.I have four    
hobbies.The most popular hobby in      
Garstang was gardening.Other leisure   
time activities which figured          
prominently were walking having a drink
with friends or reading.To assess      
childrens hobbies Children throughout  
the school were asked.Strange hobbies  
were given :collecting badges,rubbers  
looking after fish, looking at         
wildlife,gymnastics,swimming,soccer.The
building of a new sports centre in the 
near future may well see a change in   
the hobbies of the adults and children 
of Garstang. By M.Fairclough.          </content>
