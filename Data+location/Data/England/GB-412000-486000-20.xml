		<content> I sat on the green iron seat by the   
 Cross in Middleham. This is what I    
 saw. A light blue mini_car drove past.
 Some horses trotted by, their hooves  
 clattered on the road. A stable_lad   
 walked past. He was carrying a saddle,
 reins and bridle. He was wearing      
 jockey boots,jodhpurs and a crash     
 helmet. A horse box reversed out of a 
 gateway.The postman strolled by. The  
 chimneys cast long shadows across the 
 road.An old lady walked slowly up the 
 hill. She had a scarf round her head. 
 The dustbinmen arrived carrying       
 dustbins and emptying them into the   
 lorry.The Black Swan and The Black    
 Bull pub signs swung in the breeze.A  
 young woman pushed a baby past in a   
 pram.A man and a woman held hands.I   
 looked up at the Castle and then      
 across to the telephone box in the    
 corner by the Methodist Chapel.       </content>
