		<content>{PRIORY CHURCH OF ST.MARY &amp; ST.BLAISE  
 In 1108 Robert de la Haye married the 
 sister of his overlord the Earl of    
 Arundel.  They marked this occasion by
 a gift of property in England to their
 "home" Abbey at Lessay, in the        
 Cotentin peninsula, 35 miles south of 
 Cherbourg in Normandy. The Abbot sent 
 three of his Monks to Boxgrove to     
 Superintend their new property. The   
 community became a "cell" of the      
 mother house and in 1115 a Priory and 
 Church was begun. The number of monks 
 was gradually increased by            
 benefactions from 3 to a total of 19  
 in the year 1230.                     
 Architecturally, the Church shows     
 evidence of three main building       
 campaigns. (1) c.1120 Norman style (2)
 c.1170 Transitional style and (3)circa
 1220 Early English Style.
