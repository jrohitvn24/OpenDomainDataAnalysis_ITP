		<content> Winter lapwings with their northern   
 visitors the golden plovers have gone 
 from the fields. First chiff-chaff and
 willow warblers are heard. Snow-white 
 flowers of blackthorn bloom, later to 
 give sloes for wine. Swallows and     
 martins begin to arrive and we hear   
 the first cuckoo. Hedgehogs snuffle   
 about in gardens, bats hihernate no   
 more. Chaucer's pet flower, the daisy,
 pops up on lawns and the cuckoo plant 
 unfurls its leaves in hedgerows. The  
 first butterfly, a yellow brimstone,  
 flutters by. The last migrants arrive,
 the swifts, screaming joyfully across 
 the skies, and the spotted flycatcher,
 choosing its perch from which it      
 sallies back and forth for insects. At
 last the hawthorn smothers the        
 hedgerows with sweet-smelling blooms. 
 A chorus of birds fills the air at    
 dawn and spring has arrived.          </content>
