		<title>20The Birmingham Canal systems</title>
		<content>The system in Birmingham was built to  
exploit{coal and iron resources}of the 
area. The railways superceeded canals  
which are not now used for industrial  
transport.{The West Midlands County    
Council}is promoting the canals with a 
view to{recreational purposes}. Various
cruising and towpath walks have been   
given in{a special information leaflet}
which highlights historical and scenic 
routes to the visitor. In this area    
there are two canals which join in     
{Kings Norton}. The Birmingham and     
Worcester Canal has about 5 miles of   
towpath from here to the city centre.  
The Stratford on Avon Canal also has   
an interesting scenic walk. At Kings   
Norton there are some moorings for     
longboats and a sanitary station for   
boat users who are often {holiday      
makers or canal enthusiasts}. Canals   
are being improved for public use.     </content>
