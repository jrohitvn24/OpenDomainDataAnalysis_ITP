		<title>15RELIGION IN THE VALLEY</title>
		<content>     A wide variety of religious       
 beliefs can be found throughout the   
 Tame valley.The three strongest groups
 are the{Church of England,Roman       
{Catholics}and{Methodists.}Other       
 religions to be found include {       
{Unitarians,Congregationalist}and{     
{Jehovah's Witness}all of which have   
 places of worship in the area. Asian  
 immigrants are now having an impact on
 the form of places of worship. Plans  
 have been made to open a Mosque for   
 those of the{Islamic}faith.           
     The fact that there are three     
 parish churches for C. of E. arises   
 because of Mossley once being within  
 the boundaries of three counties.     
 These churches are                    
 St.Georges (Lancashire), St.Johns     
 (Yorkshire) and All Saints (Cheshire) 
 . The R.C.Church is St.Joseph's       
 situated in Top Mossley.              </content>
