		<title>19HUNTING NEAR STUBHAMPTON</title>
		<content> There is a long history of these      
 sports in the area and there have been
 some notable huntsmen in the past,    
 including King John and Edward VII.   
 In one part of the area artificial    
 'covers'are maintained for the rearing
 of pheasants and a few partridges,    
 providing game for shooting each      
 autumn.The copses,spinneys and gorse  
 patches also provide sanctuaries for  
 the foxes,which are hunted by the     
 Portman Hunt.A small amount of        
 deerstalking also takes place,as part 
 of the managment of the deer          
 population.   There is also a fair    
 degree of unofficial hunting and      
 shooting taking place in the form of  
 poaching.However,the old-fashioned    
 methods have been replaced by         
 professional commercialised stealing.
