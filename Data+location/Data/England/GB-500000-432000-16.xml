		<content>  There are two buildings at Westfield 
 School; one has the infant classes and
 the other the junior classes and the  
 offices. The junior building was built
 first in 1970 but had infants in as   
 well and there became so many children
 that the other building was started   
 about three years later. The new      
 building was supposed to be a separate
 school with its own headteacher but it
 was never finished because of the fall
 in the birthrate and there is one     
 headteacher for both buildings. There 
 are now about 280 children. There are 
 two halls, a kitchen and a dining     
 centre. There is a secretary and a    
 caretaker. The school is open plan and
 both halls have strange shaped roofs  
 which are called 'folded-plate' roofs.
 On the school field there are four old
 oak trees which can be seen on a 200  
 year old map in the Record Office.    </content>
