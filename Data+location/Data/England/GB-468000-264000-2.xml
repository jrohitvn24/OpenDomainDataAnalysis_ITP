  The population of the area has       
changed very little during the past one
hundred years. There has been little   
building growth within the villages    
and this has caused the nucleus of the 
population to remain within the        
locality.                              
                                       
  There are comparatively few young    
people in the villages.There are thirty
children at Harlestone school, five    
less than in 1967.Most people are in   
the age range above thirty.            
                                       
  Few people work directly for the     
Spencer estate.Most work outside the   
villages,in Northampton or             
neighbouring towns.At least one        
commutes daily to London.              
                                       
  There are only 21 electors at Althorp</content>
