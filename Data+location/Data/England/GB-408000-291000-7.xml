		<content> Most parents were working.  The jobs  
 varied enormously.  Several mothers   
 are dinner-ladies or work as barmaids.
  Some fathers and brothers worked in  
 the building trade either             
 self-employed or for a firm.  They did
 jobs like plastering, brick-laying,   
 electricians.  One brother is a       
 equestrian artist.  He goes to horse  
 and greyhound races and has           
 exhibitions of his work.  Older       
 brothers and sisters work in banks and
 building societies.  Some are on Youth
 Training Schemes or secretarial       
 course.  One father lays sewer pipes  
 and has been a bus driver for 25      
 years, another works in Germany and   
 one lectures at a University in Iraq. 
 He has been unable to join his family.
  Some mothers are employed as domestic
 staff in hospitals, or school         
 cleaners.  Many pupils work in shops. </content>
