		<content> Malkins Bank golf course was laid down
 about 8 years ago on an industrial    
 tip. It has been played on for about 5
 years. It is a municipal course which 
 means that anyone regardless of       
 ability can play. The Greenkeeper     
 begins work at 8:00 in the morning. 3 
 days a week he mows the greens. the   
 height of the grass must be no more   
 than 6mm. The hole is move 3 times a  
 week. Every 2 weeks the grass is cut  
 vertically to clean out weeds. 3 times
 a year the greens are fed with liquid 
 manure and dressed  with a sand       
 compost. The greens need the most     
 attention, followed by the tees, the  
 fairways, the semi-rough and bunkers. 
 The golf course is very popular and a 
 daily average of 150-175 people use   
 it. The weekends are the most popular 
 time.
