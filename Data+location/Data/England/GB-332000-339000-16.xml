		<title>16Robbery at Erbistock PO</title>
		<content> Most of the village of Erbistock is in
 this block, but the village shop is   
 750 m North on the A539. This shop is 
 a general store and post office. On   
 25th August 1983 two youths entered   
 the shop enquiring about riding gear. 
 As the sub-postmaster turned his back 
 to fetch a riding jacket, one of the  
 youths held a knife to his back and   
 told him to empty the till. Whilst    
 doing this he signalled to his wife to
 go and telephone the police. The      
 police erected road blocks and when   
 the youths were leaving they          
 apprehended them.                     
 The sub-postmaster was subsequently   
 awarded a certificate of bravery which
 he now proudly displays in his shop.
