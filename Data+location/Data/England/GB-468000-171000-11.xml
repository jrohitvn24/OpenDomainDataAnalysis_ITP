		<title>11CHILDRENS GAMES W.READING</title>
		<content> Times don't change or do they?The     
 technological age making its mark     
 everywhere has had its impact on      
 childrens games.Hand held computor    
 games compete with their home equi    
 valents;mini munchman being a popular 
 example,its aim for the operator to   
 find a way through a maze,eating fruit
 and power pills avoiding the ghosts.  
 the player is given 4 lives in which  
 to achieve the highest score.A        
 solitary game and exciting but its    
 popularity has not yet usurped the    
 long lived game of tag.The rules vary 
 but the essence is the same;run or be 
 caught.Football persists as a         
 favourite whilst marbles and skipping 
 continue as seasonal alternatives.The 
 most popular game amongst todays      
 junior schoolchildren is 4040,a       
 modified version of the all time fav  
 ourite-hide and seek.                 </content>
