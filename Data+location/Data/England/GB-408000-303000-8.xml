		<content>The game I like best is rounders the   
other games I like are cricket, netball
and bulldog. The most popular thing in 
the school is rounders. You have to be 
quite a fast runner to be good at      
rounders. 15 people like playing       
cricket, 26 like playing rounders, 4   
like playing bulldog and 2 like playing
netball. 10 like playing football 3    
like playing hopscotch, 7 like playing 
hide and seek and 8 like playing       
leapfrog best. My hobby is pony riding 
and looking after ponies. I have my own
pony she is a 13.2hh bay mare 8 years. 
I have had her 3 months. She has been  
shod twice. I keep her at Court Drive. 
She stays in her stable at night       
because the Geldings go out at night.  
When the Geldings come in in the       
morning the mares go out. In the winter
they go out together.
