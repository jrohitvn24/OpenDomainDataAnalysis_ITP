		<content> our area at Maddocks Quarry, where    
 sandstone is quaried. What then       
 remains of an industrial tradition ?  
 And what efforts are being made to    
 salvage something for the future ?    
   At Doseley, Johnston Pipes Limited, 
 founded in the area in 1904, continue 
 an important local industrial         
 tradition. They employ 73 staff and 80
 weekly paid employees. All of the     
 employees live in the locsl area. The 
 average age of the workforce is 27 and
 most workers earn over Â£100 per week. 
 Concrete pipes were first made at the 
 factory in 1931. In the past decade   
 the company has become noted for its  
 manufacture of glass reinforced       
 plastic pipes. These are used in      
 sewage and water carrying systems.    
 Their export potential, paricularly to
 the Middle East, has earned the       
 factory a Queen's Award for Industry. </content>
