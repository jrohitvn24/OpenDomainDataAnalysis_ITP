		<title>03The Mausoleum</title>
		<content> A quarter of a mile from the chapel   
 lies the mausoleum. It was one of the 
 buildings of its time to be errected  
 in 1776. It has a distinctive shape   
 with arched catacombs and a dome top. 
 It was built as a resting place for   
 John Delaval, the last son of the     
 Delavals. He was born in 1765 and in  
 1775 while paying his addresses to a  
 laundry maid he unfortunately died    
 after being kicked in a vital organ.  
 This left the last male Delaval, Lord 
 John Delaval who died at the breakfast
 table at 80 years of age. The         
 Mausoleum was never, as the bishops   
 fee was considered too expensive. So  
 the Mausoleum was never used as, the  
 niches in the vault are unoccupied and
 even today the vault has remained     
 empty.
