		<title>05Beccles Swimming Pool</title>
		<content>                                       
Beccles has an open air swimming pool. 
If it is a nice warm sunny day lots of 
people like to go to the swimming pool.
They can swim or lie in the sun on the 
grass.                                 
Unfortunately at the moment there is a 
problem as there is a leak in the pool 
and engineers think that the life of   
the pool is coming to an end.The pool  
is very busy throughout the summer.It  
is open to the public as well as the   
Kingfishers smimming club.They help    
children to learn to swim and if the   
pool closes many Beccles youngsters    
will not learn.                        
A new indoor pool is needed in the area
but there is an arguement about which  
town will get it-Beccles,Bungay or     
Halesworth.No decision hasbeen taken   
yet.
