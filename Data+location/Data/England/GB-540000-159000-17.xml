       Magnolia Drive is an enjoyable  
 place to live.  Most of the children  
 go to Charles Darwin School.  Four    
 years ago Magnolia had a street party 
 yo celebrate the royal wedding.       
 Usually you will see all the children 
 from Magnolia playing together.  There
 is a small amount of space to run     
 about, so if it gets too crowded, we  
 all go over to the recreation ground. 
       A girl in our class thinks she  
 would prefer to live in Magnolia than 
 somewhere in the valley.  Magnolia    
 Drive is quite busy at twelve noon to 
 the end of the working hours.         
       There was a fight involving the 
 police and their dogs and the boys in 
 Magnolia.                             
       The shops that are nearest to us
 are Biggin Hill Toys and the Pantiles.</content>
