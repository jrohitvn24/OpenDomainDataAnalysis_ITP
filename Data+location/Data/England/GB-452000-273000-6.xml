		<content> At the top of Deerings Road,at the end
 of Hillmorton Green,there is some land
 and on it is a horse trough. It is    
 inscribed with the words "In Memory of
 George Anthony Fenwick 1912".         
 He was a London banker who came to    
 live in Hillmorton. His house was     
 called "The Croft".He had a lot of    
 servants inside the house and outside 
 in the stables.Mr.Fenwick liked       
 hunting and had sixteen hunters in his
 stables.His wife and two daughters    
 also liked riding.                    
 He had many trees planted on the      
 village green.Fenwick Drive,which is  
 named after him,is built on the site  
 of his garden and stables.            
 Although he has been dead for many    
 years,the trees and horse trough help 
 us to remember him.
