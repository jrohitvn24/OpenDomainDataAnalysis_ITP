		<title>20TRANSPORT IN CH. MINSHULL</title>
		<content> Church Minshull is at the junction of 
 B5074 Nantwich/Winsford road and a    
 minor road to Crewe that crosses the  
 river by the only bridge between      
 Nantwich and Winsford.This means{heavy
{commercial traffic}which is detriment-
 al to roads,buildings and life style. 
 Farm machinery and herded stock       
 regularly use the roads. An hourly{bus
 service (Crosville K31) runs between  
 Northwich,Winsford and Crewe, but     
 there is no public service to Nantwich
 Contract coaches take primary school  
 children to Worleston and secondary   
 school children to Malbank,Nantwich.  
 The road is an emergency route so it  
 gets priority treatment in bad        
 weather.Nearly all households have one
{car,}many more. There are a few motor 
 cycles and bicycles. The{canal}is used
 by holiday makers and a few small     
 boats and canoes use the river.       </content>
