		<title>16A DAY OUT TO CHATHAM, 1985</title>
		<content>  There is no carpet and some          
compartments can be rather dirty at    
times.  Compartments are usually ones  
where one can smoke, although there are
some for non-smokers.  There are also  
some windows and those above the door  
open.                                  
  In Chatham we go to most of the      
clothes and shoe shops, buying various 
things which we can afford.            
  At around 1.00 pm, we start to feel  
hungry, and each time we go to a       
different place to have our lunch.     
We sometimes go to Tesco's restaurant  
which is reaonably cheap.  Around 1    
pound 20 for a real orange drink plus a
warm dinner, chips, beans and          
beefburger.  Not long after settling   
down comfortably, it is time to go.    
  We usually go back home on the       
train at 3.00 pm.  By Teresa Kujawska
