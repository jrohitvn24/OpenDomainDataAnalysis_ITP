		<title>13    Sports Day 1985</title>
		<content>   On the 9th of July we had our school
{sports day.}We held it on the playing 
 field. The 5 year olds to 11 year olds
 took part. There were 44 different {  
{races.  }                             
    There were flat races where you    
 just run up to the finish line and    
 spider races where you get on your    
 hands and feet and run.               
    Some of the{events}like high jump  
 and long jump were done before.       
    Some were{relay races}like the     
 balloon race where you run and burst  
 the balloon. Mr Giles, our teacher,   
 had to pop some of them with his pen. 
 There was a slow cycle race where you 
 try to be last.                       
    There were cups for the best boys  
 team, best girls team, best overall   
 team and best sports person. There was
 a toddlers race and there was ice pops
 for everybody at the end.             </content>
