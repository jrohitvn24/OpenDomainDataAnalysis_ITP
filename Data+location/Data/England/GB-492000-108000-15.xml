		<title>15Camping in Slindon Woods.</title>
		<content> Just off Slindon Top Road, on the road
 to Eartham village, the Camping Club  
 have a camp site which is set in the  
 famous and beautiful Slindon Beech    
 Woods. It is reported that it was near
 here that the future King Charles II  
 paused to admire the view during his  
 escape to France after the Battle of  
 Worcester in the 17th century.        
 Visitors to the camp site are free to 
 explore the local woods and beauty    
 spots, including Nore Folly (page 10  
 of this text) and Eartham Village     
 (page 14 of this text). The camp site 
 is a small, intimate camp, where back_
 packers are welcomed. Its amenities   
 are good, but visitors must be warned 
 that the nearest bus stop is some two 
 miles distant from the site!
