		<content> A survey was conducted of the industry
 on the{Long Lane Industrial Estate}in 
{Aintree}(see photograph A).           
   We found out that most of the firms 
 were quite small.  They do not employ 
 many people. There were about the same
 number of firms which manufacture     
 goods as those which provide a        
 service.                              
                                       
   We followed this up by visits to six
 firms.  An example of the sort of     
 service industry is{N.Hanlon.}There   
 they fit the equipment for the        
 ambulances such as sirens, seats, and 
 stretchers. They would complete in    
 this way fifteen ambulances a week.   
                                       
   One of the firms visited was a      
 manufacturing firm called{W.Flanagan &amp;
{Son Ltd.}(see Page 7)
