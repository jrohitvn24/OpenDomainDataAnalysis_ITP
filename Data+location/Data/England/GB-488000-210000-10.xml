		<title>10Halton House ,Aston Clinton</title>
		<content>    In 1850 ,the Rothschilds purchased 
 the Halton Estate and a large house   
 was built. The army owned it in 1913  
 and used it to train cadets. In 1917  
 the airmen came into the picture and  
 used Halton House as offices. The     
 process whereby Halton Park passed    
 from the Rothschilds into the less    
 gentle hands of the War Office has    
 been obscured by the passing years.   
 One modern version is that Alfred     
 Rothschild presented the entire estate
 to the hard-pressed government as a   
 gift. The other is that the War       
 Office, armed with emergency powers,  
 imposed compulsory purchase, and      
 Alfred promptly died of a broken      
 heart.These days servicemen occupy the
 estate and use it as an officer's     
 mess, soldiers also receive medals at 
 Halton House.
