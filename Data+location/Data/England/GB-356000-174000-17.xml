		<title>17BRISTOL REDLAND GREEN</title>
		<content> Redland Green is a local park.One part
 is higher up by Redland Chapel,built  
 in 1740 for the Cossins of Redland    
 Court (now Redland High Scool).An     
 avenue of trees leads to the chapel   
 with a grass triangle which is the    
 site of Redland Fair,held every May   
 day bank holiday for the last 8 years.
 This year my mum organised the fair.  
 There were 60 stalls,selling all kinds
 of things,with a Punch and Judy show a
 brass band and Maypole and Morris     
 dancing.                              
 Further along is a bowling green and  
 children's playground.Nearby is       
 Bristol Lawn Tennis where the West of 
 England Championships are held.A path 
 leads down to the stream and a large  
 grassy dip. This part used to be a    
 farm.My neighbour who is 70 can       
 remember shep grazing here.The old    
 farmhouse is still there.             </content>
