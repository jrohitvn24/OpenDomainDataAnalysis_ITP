		<title>11EMPLOYMENT IN S.NORMANTON</title>
		<content> Employment in our area is changing a  
 lot because the coal industry which   
 was once the main employer is slowly  
 dying and getting much smaller.Also   
 new types of industry are coming into 
 our area for five main reasons:       
{1.}The Growth Zone                    
 The Government has called our area a  
 Growth Zone which means that grants   
 and cheap rents are offered to new    
 industry.                             
{2.}The M1 Motorway                    
 This has bought easier transport to   
 the area since it opened in 1968.     
{3.}Alfreton Railway Station           
 A fast regular service bringing people
 from miles around.                    
{4.}The A38                            
 With the M1 Motorway this has         
 improved transport.                   
{5.}Many people in the area need jobs.
