   When we interviewed the licencee of 
"The Crown Inn"we found out a lot of   
different things. For instance the     
oldest part of the inn is 500 years    
old. It was originally built as a      
stable. It had been a bakers, but about
150 years ago it was converted into an 
inn. Most old pubs are supposed to be  
haunted but this one is not. Most of   
its staff are part-timers. There has   
been only one fight there in the       
landlord's memory.                     
   The busiest day is Saturday. Their  
deliveries arrive on Thursdays and     
Fridays (That is if they don't run out 
of anything) They open for four hours  
in the mornings and for five hours in  
the evening, A particular attraction to
customers is the set of cups won over  
the years by Otford football team. The 
pub is open for 365 days a year.       </content>
