		<title>05FARMING_PERRANPORTH.</title>
		<content> I used to live on "Little Lambriggan  
 Farm".There were pigs,cows,sheep and  
 ducks on the farm.There were two farm 
 houses made from one large one.       
 There were eight fields,one of them   
 had horses in it,but unfortunately,   
 the horses both died.                 
 About seven people worked on the farm,
 everyone helping with the jobs.I was  
 only three,but I used to help planting
 the vegetables.In the summer I go up  
 and help in the same way.             
 Sometimes now we get the tractor out  
 and help pick up the potatoes.I get   
 paid two pounds or three pounds if I  
 work ever so hard.                    
 I used to have a pet adder,which had  
 its poison taken out,but only my Gran-
 dad would touch it.                   
 There are not many farms in our town, 
 but my Uncle owns "Wheal Jerrah Farm".
