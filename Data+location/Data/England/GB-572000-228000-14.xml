		<content>      Farms in this area are mostly    
 arable. The main crops are wheat and  
 barley for bread, biscuits and animal 
 feed. Since the{British Sugar Corp.   
 closed its{Felsted}factory, sugar beet
 has been largely replaced by oil seed 
 rape. Peas and beans are used as break
 crops.  At{Gt. Codham Hall}durum wheat
 is grown for pasta and rye, under     
 contract to{Ryvita,}for crispbread.   
     There are 200 pigs at{Spices Farm,
 40 beef cattle at{Codham Hall}and some
 sheep at{Iron Bridge Farm.            
      At{Boydell's Farm, Roy Threadgold
 keeps a dairy herd of about 50        
{Friesians.}He supplies{Lord Rayleigh's
{Dairy}with 450 litres of milk per day 
 from 34 cows. We visited the farm and 
 saw the milking parlour in operation. 
 On a later visit some children tried  
 hand milking. This term some of us    
 were thrilled to see a calf born.     </content>
