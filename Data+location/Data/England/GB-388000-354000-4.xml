		<title>04Farming in Knypersley.</title>
		<content>  Farming in the Knypersley area is    
mainly pasture.Most of the area is     
rough grazing moorland.                
  Ladymoor Farm is a special unit owned
and managed by Goeffrey and Carol      
Crawford.The farm specialises in free  
range hens and has not used artificial 
fertilisers since 1978.All materials   
used in food production are organic.   
The hens have the freedom of the full  
20 acres  of the farm during the day   
and are returned at night to sheds for 
protection.At present there are some   
two thousand hens but the owners have  
plans to expand to meet the increasing 
demand for their products.             
  Greenway Bank Farm,situated in the   
centre of the country park,is a        
privately owned livestock farm.The     
stock are  chiefly dairy cattle.Other  
farms in more exposed areas specialise 
in breeding sheep.                     </content>
