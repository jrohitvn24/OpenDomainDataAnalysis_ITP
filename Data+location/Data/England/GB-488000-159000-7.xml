		<content> The rapid growth of Camberley,during  
 the last twenty years has been aided  
 by the expansion of several small     
 companies of builders.Probably the    
 most well known company in this area  
 is Charles Church.Charles Church is a 
 local company founded in 1966,when a  
 Mr C.J.G.Church buIlt his first house,
 here in Camberley.Since then it has   
 transformed into a multi-million pound
 international business concept,with   
 building developments in parts of     
 Southern England and Ireland.They are 
 generally rather "up-market"homes,well
 designed and pleasantly landscaped.   
 Most C.C. develpments in this area    
 have been "in-fill" development.An old
 Victorian house being pulled down     
 making room for several new homes.A   
 recent development is a large estate  
 near Lightwater.
