		<title>11Progress Road Estate.</title>
		<content>  The building of 2{gasometers}caused a
 number of protests among the residents
 of Eastwood in 1959. However, they    
 marked the beginnings of a large and  
 prosperous{industrial estate}that was 
 to spring up in the next 20 years     
 around Progress Road.                 
  Previously, the village of Eastwood  
 had been surrounded by farms with the 
 Bellhouse brickworks, owned by the    
 Cornish family, its only industry.    
 Today it is a thriving community, many
 of whose members came down from the   
 London suburbs to buy new properties  
 on the pleasant housing estates and to
 find work in the factories.           
  The brickworks no longer exist, being
 replaced by the industries listed on  
 the previous page. The Cornish family 
 now runs a removal firm.
