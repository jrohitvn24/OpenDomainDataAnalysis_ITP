		<content>  There is a Health Centre in the      
 village of Uffculme which is served by
 four doctors. There is often a nurse  
 and a Health Visitor at this site to  
 help and advise people about health   
 and social problems also. Prescribed  
 medicene can be obtained from the     
 Pharmacy here. Unfortunately there    
 is no chemist in the Village and the  
 nearest is Cullomton.                 
   The elderly are fairly well catered 
 for. At Culm Haven there are a number 
 of houses for elderly people, some    
 being single and others for married   
 couples. These are linked through an  
 intercom to a resident warden who will
 come to assist if anyone is in        
 trouble. This scheme is operated by   
 the Council and there is a similar    
 private scheme at 'Markers'. This     
 scheme was developed by Uffculme      
 Housing Trust and is being extended.  </content>
