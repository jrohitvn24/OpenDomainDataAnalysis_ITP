		<title>07An afternoon Out</title>
		<content> On wednesday the 26th June 1985, we   
 were going to North Weald Air Field.  
 When we got there we saw the Catalina 
 which was a big South African plane.  
 It had never been to England before.  
 It was very big and it had to go very 
 fast when it was taking off. Some     
 photographers were interviewing Gary  
 Numan who is a pop star and has his   
 own plane.  Later he was in a dog     
 fight with a Corsair. Then Gary landed
 and there was a wooden model of       
 Gary's plane on the side of the grass.
 The corsair tried to shoot Gary's     
 plane but the 1st time he missed the  
 second time he shot is and there was  
 all black smoke everywhere. A bit of  
 it was on fire so the fire engine had 
 to come and put the fire out. Some men
 set some bombs off by remote control. 
 It was very frightening as we didnt   
 expect it.                            </content>
