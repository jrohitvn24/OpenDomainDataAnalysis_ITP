		<title>05Great Barford House</title>
		<content> Great Barford House is a large,       
 imposing home for the Hughes family.  
 The house was extended in the middle  
 of the 19th.century and portraits of a
 previous owner,John Arnold and his    
 wife hang in the dining room.The most 
 striking feature is the water tower.  
 Every day water is pumped up to the   
 tower from the spring which flows     
 towards the cellar.                   
 Mr.and Mrs.Hughes have started to     
 restore the house and have faced      
 problems with rising damp,woodworm and
 a very complicated heating system.Mrs.
 Hughes has modernised the kitchen but 
 told us she "liked to live in the     
 past"and so the other rooms have a    
 Victorian atmosphere.Their home has a 
 swimming pool,tennis court and        
 extensive grounds.The house is a      
 Listed Building.
