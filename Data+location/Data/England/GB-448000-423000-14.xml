 5th largest makers of{engine bearings 
 in UK.They send their products all    
 over the world, even to Japan and     
 China.                                
 Harkers{Shipyard}on the canal used to 
 build barges and fishing boats,but now
 they can't compete on price, so they  
 repair &amp; refit boats,engines,shipping 
 containers and anything else to keep  
 out of the red!Part of the yard is now
{small factory units}but many are empty
 as they have not been successful.

{bottle moulds}, and parts for{power   
{stations}, and{coal}and{textile       
 machinery.In an electric induction    
 furnace,high frequency AC current     
 changes polarity 1000 times a second  
 in a thick copper wire coil around the
 crucible full of{iron},which heats up 
 like food in a microwave oven.        </content>
