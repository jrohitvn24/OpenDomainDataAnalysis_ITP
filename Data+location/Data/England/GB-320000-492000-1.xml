 it is comparatively remote and        
 attracts few visitors. The main       
 occupation is non-arable farming, hill
 sheep and cattle with a few small     
 dairy herds.  Forestry and quarrying  
 provides some work for the            
 inhabitants, whilst catering for      
 holiday-makers provides a necessary   
 second income for several farms.

 the diminution of the agricultural    
 work force, and the area looks back on
 its past of slate quarrying, iron     
 mining and oak coppiling than to the  
 future.
