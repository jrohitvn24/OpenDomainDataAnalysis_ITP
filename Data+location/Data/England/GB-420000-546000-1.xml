		<title>01REVIEW OF MAP BLOCK</title>
		<content>    This 4km by 3km block is to be     
 found in mid-west Durham skirting the 
 villages of Sacriston (to the east),  
 Edmondsley (north east) and Witton    
 Gilbert (south east). It consists     
 mainly of farmland, with some         
 woodland, a little mining and         
 quarrying.                            
    The main occupation is farming and 
 the following nineteen pages reflect  
 this dominance. The main area of      
 settlement is the residential area of 
 Witton Gilbert and the articles on    
 "Home Life" are take based upon people
 living in this village. Although the  
 mid-Durham area is generally          
 considered to be largely "working     
 class", the section of Witton Gilbert 
 included in the block houses          
 "professional" people and thus the    
 typical weekends may not seem         
 anachronistic.                        </content>
