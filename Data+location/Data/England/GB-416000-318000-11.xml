		<title>11The Fish Pond,  Barton</title>
		<content>One of the most beautiful features in  
Barton is the fish pond which is       
situated near to the Junior School and 
the Holland Sports Club.Although only a
small shallow pool it attracts not only
anglers but a wide variety of wild     
life.Trees surrounding the pond are    
Alders,Willows,Hawthorns and one       
Lombardy Poplar.The main marginal      
plants are Reed Mace with a few Yellow 
Flag Iris.Some of the water birds that 
nest by or use the pond are            
Coots,Moorhens, Blackheaded Gulls,     
Kingfishers and Grebes.Swans were      
removed last year suffering from lead  
shot poisoning and  have not returned  
this year.Towards the centre of the    
pool is a man-made island planted with 
a willow sapling.It is hoped to        
encourage birds to nest there in the   
future.Dragonflies and a variety of    
insects live in and around the pond.   </content>
