 By the use of applied science and good
 planning over 11,000 acres are now    
 cropped. The plan started by using a  
 mixed farm system - cattle, sheep and 
 pigs, and fodder to feed the same esp-
 ecially lucerne etc. The animals in   
 turn fed off the various stubbles and 
 fertilized as they fed. The programme 
 has altered technically now with much 
 mechanical investment and the cattle  
 have gone, there are still 4 herds of 
 pigs (5,000) and 1 flock of           
 sheep(1,000),Suffolk/Border Leicester 
 cross ewes.The latter are based at    
 Icklingham but are moved round for    
 feed.Crops include about 5,000 acres  
 of cereals,3,000 sugar beet and 500   
 of root vegetables.Private forest     
 accounts for 2,500 acres and rough    
 grazing 1,500 acres.
