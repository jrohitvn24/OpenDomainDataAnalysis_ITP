		<title>02COWLING A MOORLAND VILLAGE 2</title>
		<content> In recent years many farm houses have 
 been bought simply as dwellings       
 and the land sold off to bigger farms.
 Many residents now travel out of the  
 village to work in bigger towns and   
 cities nearby,and there has been a    
 corresponding decrease in the number  
 of shops,which have been affected,too,
 by the growth of supermarkets locally.
 In spite of these quite drastic       
 changes Cowling has retained much of  
 the character and appearance it has   
 had for many years,in some cases      
 decades,and is still recognisable as a
 good example of its kind.Although the 
 village itself is not immediately     
 enhanced by the mills and terraced    
 houses,built originally for the       
 workers, it is surrounded by fields   
 and moorland,with a distinctive crag  
 surmounted by two man- made memorial  
 pinnacles overlooking the area.       </content>
