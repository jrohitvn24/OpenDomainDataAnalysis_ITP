		<title>02 BOTTOM WOOD, RADNAGE</title>
		<content> Bottom Wood is an ancient woodland,   
 owned by the Chiltern Society.Their   
 Small Woodlands Project Team began    
 managing it in 1983 to conserve       
 amenity &amp; nature.Historical features  
 include old boundary banks,saw-pits &amp; 
 ancient terraced fields.The bridleway 
 follows an old route from Wycombe to  
 Stokenchurch.Project Officer John     
 Morris showed our school round,&amp;      
 explained the management,such as      
 thinning &amp; coppicing which his team &amp; 
 volunteers do.Some felling is done to 
 promote the regrowth of important     
 species-beech,oak,ash,willow.Wych elms
 have Dutch elm disease.Rabbits &amp; grey 
 squirrels cause much damage.Plant,bird
 &amp; insect life are encouraged by       
 creating suitable habitats.A conifer  
 plantation,originally to nurse beech, 
 is being regenerated.Timber sales aid 
 the project's funding.                </content>
