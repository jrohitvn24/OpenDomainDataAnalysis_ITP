		<title>13 PITCOMBE CHURCH NR.BRUTON</title>
		<content>   People have worshipped God on the   
site of Pitcombe Church for 800 years. 
All that remains of the earliest church
is the Norman font.The tower of the    
church is 15th century,with three bells
from Pre-Reformation days.The rest of  
the church was restored in 1858,not in 
normal Victorian style,but in a genuine
attempt to repeat the original medieval
appearance of the church.              
     Nowadays,this beautiful church is 
tucked away down leafy lanes,but once  
it lay on an old road linking several  
hamlets as the focal point.            
    Pitcombe Church is dedicated to St.
Leonard,a hermit of the 6th century,a  
very popular religious figure in the   
Middle Ages.His feast-day is 6th       
November.Pitcombe is a perfect rural   
church,in a perfect rural setting.
