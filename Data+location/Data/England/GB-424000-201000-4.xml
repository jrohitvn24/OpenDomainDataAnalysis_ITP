		<title>04The Village Shop in Langford</title>
		<content>  There is only one shop in the area   
which sells food, household cleaners,  
washing powders, batteries and light   
bulbs. The owners run the shop and do  
not employ anyone. The shop is open six
hours a day and for six days a week.   
In the first six months of 1985 they   
sold four hundred loaves of bread. The 
average number of customers during the 
week is between twelve and twenty and  
at the weekend between twenty and      
thirty. Less than forty percent of the 
people in Langford use the village     
shop.                                  
  There is a mobile shop that visits   
the village twice a week. It sells     
bread, cakes, biscuits, fruit, sweets, 
crisps and other food.
