		<title>15THE M5 MOTORWAY.</title>
		<content>   This motorway is one of a series of 
 motorways which link up all the major 
 cities. The M5 runs from Exeter,      
 through Bristol and Worcester and runs
 on to Birmingham. It is here that it  
 joins onto the M6. Junction 7 is quite
 near to our area and the motorway runs
 straight through our area. It is the  
 main communication link between the   
 Midlands and the South West of the    
 country.                              
   At this moment in time, this        
 motorway is being widened in the      
 county from two to three lanes to cope
 with the increasing amount of traffic 
 that uses the motorway.               
   It is also hoped that eventually    
 Junction 7 will be connected to the   
 New Bridge in an attempt to cut down  
 on the amount of traffic going through
 the centre of Worcester on its way to 
 Kempsey,Malvern or beyond.            </content>
