		<content>{The nurserymen}can create their own   
 weather conditions because of their   
 greenhouses. They put the plants      
 outside when they are too hot and when
 they are cold they put them back in   
 the greenhouses. They use gas heaters 
 to heat the plants.The plants are also
 sprinkled with water about twice a day
 for{30 minutes}in summer.They put food
 in the water so that the plants can be
 fed and watered at the same time.     
 I also saw that they sold some little 
 clay statues of frogs and gnomes for  
 the garden. I liked the cats best.They
 sold sheds, fences, compost, peat and 
 other things. Of course,they sold     
 plants too. There are{poisonous plants
 called{Leopard Lilies}these can make  
 your mouth swell up. There were cacti,
 geraniums, silver birches and many    
 more.I liked the{tomato plants}best as
 I have some at home.                  </content>
