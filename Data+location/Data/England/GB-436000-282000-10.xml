		<title>10EBURNE SCHOOL WORK  1</title>
		<content> There are three schools in the squares
 studied.One,Eburne is the oldest.This 
 was built following the 1870 Education
 Act and was primarily the Wyken       
 Colliery School.It was later re-named 
 the Walsgrave Colliery School and is  
 now called Eburne.The name suggests a 
 possible link with the Eburne family  
 who lived in Wyken and Allesley for   
 four hundred years.Thomas Eburne was  
 Mayor of Coventry in 1830.The old     
 buildings are no longer used since the
 new Eburne site was developed in 1969.
 A former pupil visited us and told us 
 how she was taught 50 years ago.Many  
 of the children came from mining      
 families.The classrooms were still    
 evident.However since that time the   
 Seventh Day Adventists have purchased 
 the site and are making alterations.
