		<title>16BOLESWORTH ESTATE</title>
		<content> The Barbour family have lived in      
 Cheshire since 1858, originating from 
 Glasgow, having made  money from      
 cotton in Manchester. The estate      
 includes  the family home, Bolesworth 
 Castle, and many local dwellings and  
 farms. The farms are dairy concerns,  
 the most profitable in the area. The  
 family run the estate and are         
 continually organising rebuilding of  
 farms and other property. Some of the 
 castle is given over to storage of    
 building equipment. About forty people
 work on the estate.The family made    
 themselves responsible for local      
 education in 1868 by building Harthill
 School, when it was damaged by fire in
 1923 it was rebuilt by the family. The
 fields are amusingly named by the     
 owner,Ding, Dong and Bell are three,  
 Uncle, Tom, Cobbley and All are four  
 more.                                 </content>
