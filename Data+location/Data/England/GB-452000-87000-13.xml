		<title>13THE HARE AND HOUNDS</title>
		<content>   The Hare and Hounds is situated     
 South_East of Newport. It used to be a
 coaching house. The thatched part of  
 the Inn dates from the 15th century.  
 It is called the Hare and Hounds      
 because of the hunting there, and has 
 some fascinating relics. A beam, which
 holds little hooks, was used to hang  
 Michael Morey. He murdered his wife   
 and children, and burnt the house in  
 1735. There is also a Bronze Aged     
 skull on display. It was discovered   
 inside a nearby mound.                
                                       
   The Inn has two bars open to the    
 public. It has a lounge and a saloon  
 offering a wide range of pub food.    
 Being a holiday island, trade varies, 
 but the Inn employs approximately 22  
 people at the height of the season.
