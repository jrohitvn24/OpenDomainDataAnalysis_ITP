		<title>05LIFEBOAT TODAY SWANAGE</title>
		<content>   The Swanage lifeboat was built in   
 1973/4 and went into service in 1974. 
 She was named J. Reginald-Corah by the
 Duke of Kent in 1975.                 
   There is only one full-time lifeboat
 man and he launches the boat. A launch
 is possible in any weather but        
 returning back to the lifeboat house  
 is not so easy. If the sea is too     
 rough the lifeboat has to go to Poole 
 Harbour to seek shelter. Then if it is
 a low water they have to moor off the 
 coast until it can be safely winched  
 back up the slipway. Once the boat is 
 back on dry land it has to be         
 refuelled at once so that she is ready
 for action again.                     
   The lifeboat has also to be checked 
 very frequently to ensure that she is 
 always sea worthy. It is pushed half  
 way down the slipway so the coxswain  
 can inspect all round it.             </content>
