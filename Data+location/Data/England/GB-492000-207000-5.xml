   ARCHITECTURAL SURVEY:Shootersway:   
 The houses in this area all date from 
 after the end of the Second World War 
 and give an impression of wealth.They 
 can be split into two main            
 categories:bungalows and              
 American-style country houses.        
 The bungalows tended to be made of    
 painted stone,fairly big and in large 
 plots of land,with spacious gardens.  
 The country houses were extremely     
 large with even larger gardens than   
 the bungalows.One was very typical of 
 a country house in Alabama,with       
 columns and porticos.                 
 Most of both sorts  of houses had     
 double garages,with drives through    
 gates leading off a private road.
