		<title>05BRENTWOOD HOUSING SURVEY</title>
		<content>   Our survey of houses in Brentwood   
 showed the area to consist of a       
 mixture of {Victorian}and{Modern}     
 housing. Nearer to the{centre}of the  
 town the houses are mainly from the   
 Victorian period, about 120 years     
 old, and further to the outskirts     
 of the town they become more modern   
 and slightly larger.                  
                                       
                                       
   Also in the{suburbs}there are       
 several modern estates of detached and
 semi-detached houses. Houses in the   
{inner suburbs}are terraced.Most of the
 shops we found in {Warley Hill}were   
 old Victorian buildings.              
                                       
   As Brentwood expands some of the    
 older houses are being pulled down and
 replaced by modern buildings but some 
 older buildings are being renovated.  </content>
