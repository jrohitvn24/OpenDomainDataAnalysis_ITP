		<content> THE SURVEY REVEALED DEFINITE PATTERN  
 OF SHOPPING HABITS.THE OLDER          
 INHABITANTS TENDED TO USE THE ONE     
 LOCAL SHOP ON A REGULAR BASIS,MOST    
 MORE THAN TWICE A WEEK.BECAUSE OF THE 
 DIFFICULTIES WITH LOCAL               
 TRANSPORT,VISITS BY THE OLDER         
 POPULATION WERE RESTRICTED TO         
 INFREQUENT VISITS.HOWEVER,THE MAJORITY
 OF PEOPLE DID THEIR WEEKLY SHOPPING IN
 THREE MAIN                            
 AREAS-HARLOW(36.5%),EPPING(25.7%)AND  
 HODDESTON(24.3%).MANY RESPONCES ALSO  
 SHOWED A DISTINCT TENDENCY TO SHOP    
 NEAR TO THEIR PLACE OF WORK,MAINLY IN 
 AND AROUND LONDON.THE MAIN            
 DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED WERE THE     
 ABSENCE OF  A BUTCHERS AND A          
 CHEMIST.MOST PEOPLE FELT THAT WHILE   
 THEY HAD A CAR THEY WERE QUITE HAPPY  
 ,BUT AGREED THAT WITHOUT ONE LIFE WAS 
 DIFFICULT.                            </content>
