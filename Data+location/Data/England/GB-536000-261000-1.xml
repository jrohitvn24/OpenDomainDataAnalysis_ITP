		<content>   The area we have studied is a rural 
 area.Most of the land is farmed.The   
 main crops this year have  been oil   
 seed rape and wheat.Some of the land  
 is farmed by the National Institute of
 Agricultural Botany, in Cambridge,and 
 is used for their experiments and     
 field trials.Residents of Bar Hill are
 not allowed to let certain            
 vegtables,if they grow them in their  
 gardens or allotments,to go to seed.If
 they did then this could interfere    
 with N.I.A.B.'s field trials.         
   Three villages come into our study  
 area,Bar Hill,Dry Drayton and part of 
 Lolworth.                             
   The A604 major road from Harwich to 
 Kettering runs through our block.Bar  
 Hill is built alongside the A604 and  
 both Dry Drayton and Lolworth are     
 accessed from it.
