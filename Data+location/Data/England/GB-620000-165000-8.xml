		<content> The shepherd knows of only 4 locally  
 born people (other than youngsters) in
 the area today. The village has       
 changed beyond recognition. There     
 used to be a{BLACKSMITH,}wheelwright, 
 butcher, grocer and a baker. Today    
 most of the inhabitants work far away.
 There are far fewer farms with only a 
 tiny workforce. The landscape has not 
 changed much though, there never were 
 many hedgerows. You notice that some  
 of the{WILDLIFE,}has gone. No Barn    
 Owls, Frogs or Efts (Newts) and there 
 has not been an otter seen since 1958 
 The old times were hard, getting up at
 4am to feed the horses and working in 
 all weathers. After a lifetime they   
 would throw you out of your cottage   
 when you could not do a days work     
 anymore. You had to take yourself off 
 to the{WORKHOUSE.
