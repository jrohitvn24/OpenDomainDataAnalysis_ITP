 the part of the village we had in our 
 block. The other group were in North  
 Burlingham.                           
    The{landscape}of the block was     
 mianly fields with a few hedges and   
 isolated oak trees. The buildings were
 mainly farmhouses made of brick with  
 barns made of iron or wood.           
    As well as the other main farm     
 crops on farm by the main road grew   
 raspberries, strawberries,            
 gooseberries and blackberries. They   
 sold these at a stall by the roadside
