		<content> Wiggins belongs to a group of         
 factories and it  is twinned with a   
 factory in Huntington,Virginia.The    
 company has been formed since 1835    
 150 years.The sight was chosen at     
 Hereford because they didn't what all 
 the factories in Birmingham.It was    
 called Wiggins after a man called     
 Henry Wiggins.On the site where       
 Wiggins was built,there was waste land
 before Wiggins was there.There were   
 not many objections of the building of
 Wiggins because it was council        
 land.When Wiggins moved to Hereford   
 they had no plans to move anywhere    
 else.Wiggins was opened in 1953.
