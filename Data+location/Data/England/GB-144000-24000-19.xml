		<title>19Mousehole Harbour (1)</title>
		<content>     The{Harbour at Mousehole}is a     
 private harbour and has its own       
{Harbour Commissioners}who are         
 responsible for the upkeep of the     
 harbour and its surrounds.            
     The north quay is the oldest and  
 was built in three sections.  The     
 oldest part of which may have been    
 built by the{Phoenicians}as a         
 breakwater to protect the punts       
 collecting fresh water for their      
 larger boats.  This was extended soon 
 after 1389 and then further seawards  
 again in the early{18th. century.     
     The south quay (or new quay) was  
 built in the late{19th. century}using 
 some of the stones that had been used 
 for the previous south quay built     
 earlier in that century.  The large   
 wooden baulks of timber to be seen on 
 the south quay are lowered into slots 
 to seal the harbour mouth in winter.  </content>
