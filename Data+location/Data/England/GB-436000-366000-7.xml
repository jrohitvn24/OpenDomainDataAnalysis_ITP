		<title>07THE COKING PLANT WINGERWORTH</title>
		<content>   When it was built in 1956 the{NCB   
{Avenue Carbonisation and Chemical     
{Plant}was the largest fully integrated
 coking and chemical works in Europe.  
   Locally it is considered to be an   
 eye-sore, but it does help the        
 community, offering employment to over
 600 people.  Also the high rates it   
 has to pay to the council greatly     
 reduces the amount paid by each       
 household in the county.              
  Originally the Plant was given a life
 span of 20 years, so it should be     
 closing in 1986 however no decision   
 has yet been made.                    
   The whole complex is made up of the 
 following parts:                      
   {a)}Coke ovens with coal and coke   
       handling plants                 
   {b)}Chemical plant                  
   {c)}Tar plant                       
{   d)}Benzole plant                   </content>
