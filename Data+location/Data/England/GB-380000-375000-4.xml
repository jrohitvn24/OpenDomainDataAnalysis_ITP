		<title>04FARMING IN CHELFORD cont.</title>
		<content> Most of their produce is used by the  
 David Lewis Centre which owns the     
 farm.                                 
    Little Moss Farm has 80 dairy      
 cattle and 520 poultry. They grow     
 barley, grass and swedes for the      
 animals and corn and potatoes as well.
    Roadside farm has 100 dairy cows   
 and 90 sheep. They grow barley and    
 potatoes.                             
    Heawood Hall farm just grows corn  
 because less labour is needed.        
    Eight of our farms have under 100  
 acres of land and so according to one 
 farmer are actually small holdings not
 farms.                                
    Only three of the farms have any   
 workers living on the farm.           
    They all send their produce to     
 Chelford market because it is so near.
 They all use quite a lot of machinery 
 and all the farmers work long hours.  </content>
