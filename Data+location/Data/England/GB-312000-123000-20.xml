		<title>20MILVERTON REMEMBERED</title>
		<content>      MR CANNIFORD HAS LIVED IN        
 MILVERTON SINCE HE WAS A LITTLE BOY.  
 THERE HAVE BEEN LOTS OF CHANGES SINCE 
 THEN. HE SAID PEOPLE HAD NO CARS IN   
 THOSE DAYS. THE ONLY PERSON WHO HAD A 
 CAR WAS MR KNIGHT AT THE WHITE HART   
 HOTEL. OTHER PEOLE HAD PONY TRAPS.    
 MARKET DAY WAS ON THURSDAYS IN THE    
 SQUARE. THE BIG HOUSE OLANDS HAD A    
 CARRIAGE AND 4 HORSES.                
                                       
      THE CHILDREN MADE THEIR OWN FUN. 
 THERE WERE PONY GYMKHANAS. THERE WERE 
 FAIRS TOO AND ATHLETICS. HE WENT TO   
 MILVERTON SCHOOL BUT THEN IT WAS      
 DIVIDED INTO 3 CLASSES, INFANTS, GIRLS
 AND BOYS. THE BOYS CLASS WAS NEVER    
 ALLOWED UP THE STEPS TO THE GIRLS.    
 THERE USED TO BE A POLICE STATION.    
 EVERYONE WENT TO THE PICTURES BY THE  
 GOODS TRAIN, WHICH DOES NOT RUN ANY   
 MORE.                                 </content>
