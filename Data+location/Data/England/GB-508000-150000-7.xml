		<content> St.Martin's Anglican Church celebrates
 its 950th anniversary in September    
 1986.  Planning for this is well ad-  
 vanced &amp; includes a Thanksgiving      
 Service when the Bishop of Guildford  
 will preach, concerts &amp; plays by local
 societies, a flower festival &amp; exhibi-
 tion by children on the theme of St.  
 Martin.  In 1982 the N. transept was  
 extended to seat 80.  New kneelers    
 were designed &amp; worked by parishioners
 whose names are listed in a commemora-
 tive book.  Outside the church is the 
 1914/18 War Memorial &amp; a plaque on the
 lych gate names those who died in the 
 1939/45 war. Tea towels with a picture
 of the church are on sale &amp; there is a
 stewardship scheme in operation,where-
 by parishioners covenant to help fin- 
 ance work of the parish.  The church- 
 yard has many memorials incl. tombs of
 the Lovelace family of Horsley Towers.</content>
