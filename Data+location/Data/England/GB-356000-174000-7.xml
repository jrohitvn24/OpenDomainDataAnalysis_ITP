  Mr.Milson is the caretaker of        
 SS.Peter and Paul Primary School in   
 Redland.                              
 "I have lived and worked in Redland   
 for ten years.I've not seen many      
 building changes apart from the school
 being built.I would prefer the area to
 stay as it is otherwise it may lose   
 character.There are many Georgian and 
 Victorian houses which I think should 
 stay as they are .I would like to see 
 more clubs in the area where people   
 can play sports."
