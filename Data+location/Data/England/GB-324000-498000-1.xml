		<content>  Part if the English Lake District    
 National Park. An extensive upland    
 area with two elevated resevoirs, one 
 on the west flank Seathwaite Tarn and 
 the smaller levers water on the east  
 slope. As part of the conniston fell  
 group the east half of the area is    
 frequented by numerous hill walkers.  
 Noteable summits are Brin Fell, Swirl 
 How, Great Carrs and Grey Friar. Swirl
 How is the highest point distinctive  
 for its radiated ridges and water     
 drainage to four points of the        
 compass. Panaramic and scenic views   
 abound. Rocky outcrops rough pasture  
 grasses heather cover the area. Sheep 
 grazing land. A few trees exist  on   
 the lower north west slopes of Grey   
 Friar and only on that north west tip 
 does a road cut through the area.

 Trust Building is used by an Education</content>
