		<title>10Ecology of Therfield Heath</title>
		<content>   Therfield Heath is mainly grass,    
 though there are trees and hedges. The
 soil is chalk. Water is trapped in a  
 layer of greensand underneath. This is
 where our water comes from.           
   There are woods, where hawthorn and 
 other trees grow. Near Baldock Rd. are
 big horse chestnut trees, where we    
 collect conkers in autumn.            
   There are many sorts of grasses e.g.
 rye grass and wild flowers e.g.yarrow,
 plantains and buttercups. Some of the 
 flowers are quite rare e.g. cowslips  
 and pyramidal orchids.                
   Sheep are still grazed on the heath.
 There are lots of small animals such  
 as rabbits and voles and many more    
 smaller animals e.g. worms and snails.
   Many birds visit the heath e.g.wood-
 peckers and warblers and the plants   
 attract a variety of butterflies.
