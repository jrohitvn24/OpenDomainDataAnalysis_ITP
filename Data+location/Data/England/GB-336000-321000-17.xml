		<content>{RUYTON XI TOWNS CARNIVAL}is held      
 annually on August Bank Holiday Monday
 and is organised by a small committee 
 headed by the Vicar.The event is held 
 on the Burgage Field. It was          
 previously held on the Bridge Inn     
 Field by the River Perry where water  
 sports were also organised but the    
 venue had to be altered in 1984 after 
 the {SEVERN TRENT WATER AUTHORITY}    
 deepened the river by 6 feet(2m)      
 making the venue far too dangerous.   
 The programme of events starts at     
 13.30 with the pram race run from {THE
{CROSS }to {THE BRIDGE INN,}with the   
 winning pair receiving a Â£10 prize.   
 For this event the police are very    
 co-operative and close the road for   
 the duration of the race.   The       
 procession of floats commences at     
 2.OOp.m. from the Bridge Inn and ends 
 on the carnival field.   This is lead </content>
