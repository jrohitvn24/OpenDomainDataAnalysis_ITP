		<content> There is a very large transport depot 
 at Stoke Orchard run by a company     
 called Santa Fe Express.This company  
 which employs 35 people transports    
 goods throughout the UK. and to       
 countries in Europe.The large         
 warehouse was previously used by the  
 Tate and Lyle sugar company as a store
 and distribution point.During the     
 Second World War (1939-45),the        
 building was used as a tank depot.    
 Large lorries which use the quiet     
 country lane are a cause for concern  
 amongst the local inhabitants.        
         Inside the Santa Fe depot     
 there are several "starter" industries
 which have developed in recent        
 years.The rents and rates are cheaper 
 than those of Cheltenham and are thus 
 attractive to businessmen starting up 
 on their own.
