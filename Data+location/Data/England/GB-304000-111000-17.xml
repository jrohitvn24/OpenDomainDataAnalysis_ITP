		<title>17EDUCATION IN UFFCULME</title>
		<content>  There are two schools in this area,  
 both in Uffculme. The Primary School  
 (age 5-11 yrs.)has six classes and    
 about 160 children. It is expanding at
 present due to increased house-       
 building in the area.                 
    Children come mainly from the      
 Village, Ashill and surrounding farms 
 and Hamlets. The P.T.F.A. have just   
 completed a new pemanent swimming pool
 here which will be an asset for the   
 whole local community.                
   The Comprehensive School (age 11-16 
 yrs.) has about 700 pupils and this   
 too is expanding. This draws pupils   
 from the whole of the upper Culm      
 Valley and many also come from other  
 areas. Both schools play a full part  
 in local village life and much use is 
 made of the premises of these two     
 establishments by other village       
 organisations.                        </content>
