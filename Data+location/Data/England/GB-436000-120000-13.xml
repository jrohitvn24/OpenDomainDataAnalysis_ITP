 collect  coins from other countries. I
 put them in a folder to keep them     
 neat. I also play the French horn. I  
 am in several orchestras. I enjoy     
 reading books. I like science fiction 
 and fantasy books.My Dad plays the    
 organ and is interested in trains. My 
 brother plays the guitar and my mother
 enjoys singing.{Sport}I play badminton

 tennis.{Music}I like to listen to rock
 music as well as classical. Some rock
