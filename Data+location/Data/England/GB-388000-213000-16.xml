		<title>16COMMUNICATIONS IN BROCKWORTH</title>
		<content>There are lots of modern ways of       
communicating apart from reading,      
writing and speaking-not least for     
blind and deaf people.Our survey found 
that 98% of people have a {'phone} (46%
more than 1);mums use the phone more   
than the rest of the family.An average 
length call is about 5 mins.-most calls
were personal rather than for business.
{Home computer} ownership is at about  
30% (as is {video});94% listen to      
{radio} or watch {TV} in the           
morning;82% have a {newspaper}         
delivered (of those,a half have the    
local afternoon paper-The Citizen- but 
not a national daily). National radio  
was listened to by 75%; (Radio         
1"pop"music station);20%listened to    
local commercial radio (Severn Sound)  
whilst no family preferred to listen   
to Radio 3 or Radio 4.
