{fic Office}was built in 1979. The     
 function of the department is to act  
 as a back-up service for all traffic  
 problems and if necessary support the 
 Drug and other Police Squads in East  
 Kent. 120 staff are employed, about   
 1/3 civilian the rest Police Officers,
 including 2 females. Most of the civi-
 lians carry out clerical and data     
 processing duties, working office     
 hours with the option to be flexible, 
 referred to as "flexy hours". Police  
 Officers are usually uniformed and use
 white motor cars with high intensity  
 striping, distinguishing them from    
 other units of the Police Force. A    
 vehicle workshop is also sited here   
 which deals with regular servicing of 
 Police vehicles as well as repairs.The
 staff in the workshop are civilians.
