		<title>02PROSPECT VILLAGE</title>
		<content>Our group did an interview to find out 
what people thought of Prospect        
Village.We interviewed mostly middle   
aged and elderly people.We found out   
that most of them thought people in the
village had changed because they were  
not as neighbourly as they used to     
be.Others thought that there wasn't    
enough for children to do  in the      
village and that was why they had      
vandalized the bus-shelter.Some people 
thought that there was a need for a    
post-office and a chemist in the       
village .The people we spoke to        
thought that there hadn't been many    
changes in the village,even those who  
had lived there a long time.Most       
people  liked the village because   of 
the peace and quiet and the pleasant   
country surroundings.Younger people    
would probably have a different point
