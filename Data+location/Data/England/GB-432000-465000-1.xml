		<content> The village of Bishop Monkton is      
 pretty all the year round. A small    
 beck rises above the village and      
 meanders through it under many small  
 bridges.Flowering trees,spring bulbs  
 and the Church lytch gate astride the 
 stream make an attractive picture.The 
 houses in the centre of the village   
 are up to 200 years old.              
 Most of the area is farmland which    
 falls gently to the Ure valley.Along  
 the river there is an abundance of    
 flora and fauna (including herons),and
 in the winter the North bank is home  
 for several species of migrating      
 geese.There are two locks used daily  
 by leisure boats.Several fishing clubs
 are active in the area.Newby Hall is a
 stately 18th century house open to    
 visitors.
