    It was a fine day.  Most of the    
 moving was on lorries.  Teachers      
 took boxes of things and for some     
 weeks before, mothers, aunts and      
 grandma's had been busy helping.      
 The actual move took one day.         
 Children helped to unload materials   
 and everyone was very well behaved.   
 The following morning was lessons as  
 usual at 9.00 a.m.  The official      
 opening day was a very proud affair.  
 The Lord Lieutenant of the County     
 arrived exactly on time.   There was  
 afternoon tea and Lord Halifax and    
 Mr. Swain, the headteacher, both made 
 a speech.                             
                                       
    The old school has been sold to be 
 made into a home and the school had a 
 party to celebrate ten years on its   
 new site this year.                   </content>
