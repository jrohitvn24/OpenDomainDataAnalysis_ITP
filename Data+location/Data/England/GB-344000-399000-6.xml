		<title>06Rainford Local Industry</title>
		<content> Rainford's first major industry was   
 clay pipe making,but coal mining      
 produced much work in the area as     
 well.Now Rainford's industry is on a  
 Hi-tec level,with industries such as  
 service engineering,haulage and       
 agricultural vehicles.In our cross    
 section of industries,we found that   
 most were labour intensive.You must   
 take into account that over half of   
 had been in existance for only two or 
 three years. None of these industries 
 use computers but most of them plan to
 in the near future.Some of them employ
 one or two handicapped people and some
 don't.The industries were established 
 between 1949-84 and employ between    
 three and twenty-nine people. About   
 one to six are women and most of them 
 are planning to or have had           
 expansion.They are all hopeful for the
 future.                               </content>
