		<title>06LANHYDROCK ESTATE</title>
		<content> To contribute to its upkeep the estate
 and house now {trade}as a plant       
 centre, gift shop selling worthwhile  
 souvenirs of Cornwall and a restaurant
 created out of the housekeeper's and  
 housemaids' rooms.  The latter serves 
 over three hundred visitors a day.    
 Its menu consists of light snacks,    
 such as savoury flans, jacket         
 potatoes, shortbread, Cornish split,  
 jam and cream, salads and Sunday      
 lunches.  They also produce some      
 Victorian specialities, such as squat 
 pie.  The estate consists of 741 acres
 of park and woodland in the valley of 
 the River Fowey.  There is a wonderful
 avenue of beeches on the approach to  
 the house.  The formal gardens near   
 the house laid out in 1857 still exist
 as does a magnificent shrubbery of    
 azaleas and rhododendrons.
