		<title>05Bird life on Lundy.</title>
		<content> Most of the bird life is past the     
 Quarter Wall and Pondsbury and to the 
 N.of the island away from the village.
 There have been 425 species recorded  
 on and around the island.             
 There are three bird traps for        
 catching and ringing birds, Pondsbury 
 has a mist net and there are others at
 the halfway wall and the quarries.The 
 number of nesting birds is declining  
 for many reasons.                     
 The loss of Gannets was blamed on the 
 introdution of the fog-horn at the    
 North Lighthouse.Marine paints and    
 effluents pollute the sea and kill the
 fish,so the adults and chicks die from
 poisoning. The introduction of drag   
 nets has taken too many fish from the 
 sea so the chicks starve.Warm currents
 have moved away from Lundy,taking with
 them Sand Eels and small fish.
