		<title>14WESTWOOD VILLAGE</title>
		<content>   Westwood is a small village in      
 Nottinghamshire. Today it is almost   
 joined to the larger village of       
{Jacksdale}by a newly built housing    
 estate. However, despite this it has  
 still managed to retain it's own      
 identity with its own infant school   
 and United Reform Church.             
   The brick built church of{St. Mary  
 stands half way between Jacksdale and 
 Westwood and serves both villages.    
   The name Westwood probably means the
 area west of the woods. The trees were
 probably originally cleared for       
 farming purposes.
