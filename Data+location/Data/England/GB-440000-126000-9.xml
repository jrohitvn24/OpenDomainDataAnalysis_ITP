		<title>09Merdon Castle (2)</title>
		<content>  After a time this castle began to    
 fall into gradual disuse , and in the 
 year 1441 the stone out of which the  
 castle was made , was removed from the
 location . Then it was brought to the 
 City of Winchester , and was laid as  
 the foundations , and main structure  
 of Wolvesey Palace . Today all that   
 remains of the castle are the         
 earthworks and ramparts , which are   
 all very heavily overgrown .
