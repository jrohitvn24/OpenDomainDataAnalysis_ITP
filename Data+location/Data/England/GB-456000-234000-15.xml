		<title>15Brackley school day (boy)</title>
		<content>   Today, the 6th of June,I got to     
school at 8.50a.m.. The bell went at   
8.55. We went into class and got out   
our reading books. Miss Brown (my class
teacher) took the register to see who  
was here. Then she took the dinner     
register to check who was having school
dinners, who was having sandwiches and 
who was going home.After that we went  
to assembly where our headmaster talked
to us and told us a story. After       
assembly we had English and we wrote   
poems based on a poem by Adrian        
Mitchell called {I Like That Stuff}.   
After break we did maths. We were doing
probems on percentages. The lunch bell 
went at 12.00. At 1.30 we had music and
practised tunes which we had made up   
ourselves. After break we had a games  
lesson on cricket. We worked in pairs, 
throwing and catching to improve our   
fielding skills.The bell went at 3.55. </content>
