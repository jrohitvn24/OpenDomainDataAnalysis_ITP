		<content> The land is mainly undulating. The    
 River Severn lies to                  
 the west, the River Salwarpe and the  
 (now disused but being restored)      
 Droitwich Canal joining it in the     
 block. The canal - which was built for
 transporting salt from Droitwich -    
 roughly follows the line of the       
 Salwarpe.                             
                                       
 The Northern Link Road traverses the  
 block, linking the M5 motorway with   
 the A449 trunk road. There is a       
 junction with the Link Road with      
 Hurst Lane by the Blackpole           
 Industrial Estate. The A38 trunk      
 road also traverses the block and the 
 Worcester/Birmingham railway runs     
 through also; the halt at Fernhill    
 Heath was closed in the 1960's.
