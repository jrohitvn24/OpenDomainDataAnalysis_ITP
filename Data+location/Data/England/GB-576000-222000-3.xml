		<content> Bradford Street has many Georgian,    
 Medieval and Tudor houses. The        
 Georgian houses are mainly double     
 fronted and include several larger    
 building such as the old Court Hotel  
 which has retained its carriage arch. 
 The plaster work varies.There are     
 muted pastel colours with different   
 Essex Pargetting designs.             
 The Medieval and Tudor buildings      
 provide interesting examples of timber
 framed houses originally occupied by  
 weavers and merchants. The houses have
 different types of jetties and carved 
 exposed beams, frequently of a grape  
 and leaf design.                      
 In Jullian Court Road there is a house
 dated around 1600's with its original 
 oak beams. Along Cressing Road there  
 is an interesting thatched cottage    
 with deep eaves and latticed windows.
