		<title>10A girl from Rocester.</title>
		<content>   My name is Lisa and I live in a new 
semi-detached house in Rocester.I rise 
at 7.30am.,my dad has already gone to  
work at J.C.B. Mum prepares breakfast  
and then goes to school where she works
as a cook.My brother cannot find a job 
so he stays in bed while I prepare for 
school.I attend Ryecroft Middle School 
from 9am.to 3.40pm.I have 1 hour to eat
my dinner and play but the rest is hard
work.                                  
   I am glad when school ends and I can
go home. I change out of my uniform,   
have my tea which is usually sandwiches
and then go out to play.It is now the  
summer so sometimes we play rounders   
and go on the children's playground.We 
play a chasing game called tick.When I 
come in at 8.30pm.I watch T.V. or I    
listen to pop music on my music centre 
and then at 9.00pm.I go to bed in my   
own room.                              </content>
