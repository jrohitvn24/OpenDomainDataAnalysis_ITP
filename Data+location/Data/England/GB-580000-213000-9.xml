 "That'S all Witham was ...Farm people 
 or navvies on the Railway line"." As  
 an agricultural village the average   
 wage was about eleven bob to fourteen 
 shillings a week."                    
  For women a new scource of work was  
 the glove factory (Pinkhams) opened in
 1911, paying 3 or 4 shillings per     
 week.Many still worked for less as    
 domestic servants."All down the High  
 Street-all those houses were occupied 
 by well to do people. Witham was      
 considered to be very select- very    
 snooty .                              
{1914-1918 WAR.}                       
 "The 1914,you see, that war,          
 everything went different then, that  
 really, I think split the families..  
 after 1914 it wasn't Witham any more."
