		<title>05What Norton needs.</title>
		<content>The people of Norton on the whole are  
satisfied with their village, although 
not so complacent as to think that it  
is impossible to improve things. When  
asked what things they would like to   
see in the village the most popular was
a swimming baths. In fact it was       
leisure activities that were felt by   
most people to be lacking, although the
choice of amenities was various, from  
fishing to major sports complex.       
   Whilst most people were unwilling to
complain about the local shops they did
feel a need for a greater variety,     
although it was mainly small shops that
were required, for instance pet shops, 
wool shops and shoe repairers. Fashion 
shops were also said to be in short    
supply.
