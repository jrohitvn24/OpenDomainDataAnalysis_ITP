		<title>02Gretton village in Survey</title>
		<content>A government survey to list special    
buildings nationwide is to include     
Gretton in its lists.The survey for the
Department of the Environment started  
last year and is expected to end in    
1987.The aim is to identify buildings  
which can be legally protected while   
any proposals to change them are       
considered.The village of Gretton has  
been surveyed for many years and       
buildings with architectural or        
historic interests will be noted. These
will include the church down to various
barns. The work organised by           
Northamptonshire County Council will   
start in November and is expected to   
take about a week. The old lists were  
very selective and apparently a lot of 
buildings contributing to the character
of the place were missed out during the
last survey.                           
                                       </content>
