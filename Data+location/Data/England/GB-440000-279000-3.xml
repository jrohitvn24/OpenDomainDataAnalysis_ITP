		<content> 7 o'clock - glance at the alarm,my    
 outstretched arm nudges Rob into      
 action,often negotiating the plump    
 intrusion of 4 year old Kit lying like
 a bolster between us.Rob's action     
 commences with a welcome mug of tea   
 brought back to bed.7.30-all hell     
 breaks loose as we hit the bathroom   
 Liquorice the dog included.Daughter   
 Jolan glides sleepily in a little     
 later having to be cajoled into every 
 movement.Clothes seem to prove a      
 problem to our children hence Jolan's 
 are selected the night before.This    
 would be a waste of time for Kit as it
 would all be changed anyway as since  
 he's been born we've had a daily row  
 over what he should wear.We hope to   
 have consumed breakfast by 8.30 in    
 time to wave dad off on his motorbike 
 on which he travels to school in      
 Coventry 10 miles away.Jo gets ready  </content>
