		<title>08HOGNASTON VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content> Hognaston village hall is a           
 replacement for the old timber and    
 corrugated iron building.             
 It looks like a large bungalow.It is  
 built of stone and has a slate roof.  
 The doors and window frames are made  
 of wood.                              
 The building was only completed in    
 1982.The money, Â£28,000, needed to    
 build the hall was raised by the      
 village people.They ran coffee        
 evenings,and for 5 years held a       
 special village market.               
 The hall itself was designed by an    
 architect who lived in the village.The
 stone used in the building was donated
 by the Severn Trent Water Board who   
 were constructing Carsington          
 Resevoir,the stone coming from an old 
 farm building.
