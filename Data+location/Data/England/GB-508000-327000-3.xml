		<title>03MEDICAL CARE IN RIPPINGALE</title>
		<content> On the retirement of the previous     
 general practitioner,who had a surgery
 attached to his house,a{lock-up       
{surgery}was built in 1968.This is in  
 use each weekday and,because of its   
 rural location,prescriptions are      
 dispensed on the premises _ an unusual
 asset these days.A District Nurse/mid_
 wife was still resident in Rippingale 
 in the late 1970's.Following the      
 axeing of this post,these services are
 now supplied by nurses,midwives and   
 health visitors attached to the nearby
 Health Centre.More recently,the Infant
 Welfare Clinic closed and most of the 
 immunisations are now done at the     
 surgery whilst baby foods are bought  
 at the village store. We are served by
 hospitals at Stamford,Boston,Grantham 
 and Peterborough, ambulances are for  
 emergencies only,so{Rippingale runs   
{its own hospital car service.         </content>
