		<title>16The Port of Shoreham</title>
		<content> impounded water area and which is     
 nearly 2 miles long.Wharves have been 
 constructed on both sides of each     
 section of the Port.The total length  
 of wharfage is nearly 19000feet.The   
 Port Authority controls about 7000ft. 
    The port can accommodate vessels of
 115.9metres in length,16.4m beam,and  
 6.7m draught.The port imports fuels,  
 different building materials,wines and
 spirits,foods,peat and fertilizer and 
 many other goods.                     
    Exports include scrap metal,cement,
 cereals,some vehicles,general,and     
 other cargoes.                        
    Now,the Port Authority wants to    
 make the harbour into a passenger port
 capable of competing with Newhaven.   
 There are mixed attitudes about this  
 idea,but when asked the majority of   
 people liked the proposal saying that 
 it would bring prosperity to the town.</content>
