		<content> There are many Churches and places    
 of worship within the area. A large   
 number of the world's religions are   
 represented.                          
   George Nairn Briggs is the Vicar of 
 St.Peter's Church,Morden, which was   
 built in 1933.There are a large number
 of murals,painted by Peter Paelez,both
 on the inside and outside walls       
 depicting the Life of Christ.During   
 the War, it was hit by a fire bomb and
 the roof had to be replaced.          
   William Mullenger is the Vicar of   
 All Saint's Church,Hackbridge.The     
 Church is fifty one years old.The     
 pulpit was carved by German Prisoners 
 of War.The pews in the Church cost    
 Â£385 each to replace,so that few of   
 them do get replaced.
