		<content>  One villager recalls the days of the 
 Second World War when her family lived
 at the Mason's Arms. Then there were  
 two classes at the village school.    
 Both the church and Sunday School were
 well-attended. The rector was advisor 
 and father figure to all.             
  The local farms had begun to be      
 mechanised but the horse and cart was 
 still popular and there was still some
 horse ploughing. Electricity had      
 reached the village in 1934.          
  Doctors who served the village were  
 at Shifnal or Madeley. There was a    
 district nurse who travelled round the
 village on a bicycle.                 
  Every now and then a travelling      
 barber visited the Mason's Arms on a  
 Sunday morning.                       
  In those days the village shop sold  
 most things but groceries were also   
 delivered from Madeley and Shifnal.   </content>
