		<content> Traffic.                              
    The other major complaint was about
 the volume of traffic in Willerby     
 Square.Here three main roads meet: the
 one from Hull, the one to Hessle and  
 the Humber Bridge and the road to     
 Beverly which passes the Gutter Lane  
 industrial estate.In particular the   
 siting of the zebra crossings just of 
 the main roundabout was thought to be 
 very dangerous.                       
   Population movement.                
     Everyone we spoke to seemed to be 
 happy with the housing and the general
 state of the area.Only one of the     
 people interviewed had lived in the   
 area less than 5 years, half had lived
 in Willerby over 10 years.The majority
 said the area combined easy access to 
 the countryside and the town.
