		<title>07Shepshed's New Industries</title>
		<content>    Prior to the building of the{M.1.  
{motorway,}industry in{Shepshed}was    
 based on traditional crafts such as   
{hosiery}and{boot and shoe             
{manufacturing.}There was a granite    
 quarry which was in a state of        
 decline. The construction of the M.1. 
 had the immediate effect of           
 rejuvenating work at the quarry       
 because of the need for hardcore.     
 Since that time the area to the       
 south_west of Shepshed has developed  
 into an{industrial area.}Work at the  
 granite quarry has expanded to include
{readymix concrete}and a{tile making   
{works.}Proximity to the M.1 has       
 atttracted other industries, including
 a regional office of the{electricity  
{board,}distributive warehouse for     
 Mattel toys and small units for{light 
{engineering.}Unfortunately it has also
 brought environmental problems.       </content>
