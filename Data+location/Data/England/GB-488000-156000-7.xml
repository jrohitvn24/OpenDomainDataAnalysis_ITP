		<content>   The sandy slopes of{Frith Hill}are  
 covered with mixed woodland of Scots  
 Pine, Silver Birch, Oak, Willow, Rowan
 and Sweet Chestnut. The top of the    
 hill is more open with wide stony     
 paths bordered with Bracken, Gorse    
 and Heather.                          
   Wild flowers such as Stitchwort,    
 Ox-eye daisy, Wild Pansy, Thistle,    
 Plantain, Dog Rose, Speedwell and     
 Vetch can be found especially at the  
 northern end of the hill in the       
 disused dump area.                    
   There are many squirrels and        
 rabbits, lots of wood ants and plenty 
 of bird life. At the south western end
 there is a disused reservoir, now     
 overgrown with saplings.              
   The area is very useful for horse   
 and motorbike riding, for jogging and 
 taking your dog for a walk.           
   The army, who own it, train there.  </content>
