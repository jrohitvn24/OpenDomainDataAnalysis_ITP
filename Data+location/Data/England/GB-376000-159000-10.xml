		<title>10MRS COLE SAVES THE DAY</title>
		<content> The time was five to ten,             
 Mrs cole was standing when;           
 Sophie really had her troubles,       
 Coming up in frothing bubbles.        
 Natasha is pulling Soph's pyjamas,    
 Tash has now gone quite bananas.      
 This truly is a big disaster,         
 Tasha's head is made of plaster.      
 Sophie very quickly beckons,          
 She must be drowning Mrs Cole reckons.
 Here comes Mrs Cole Tights an'all,    
 Responding quickly to Sophie's call.  
 In she comes a somersault,            
 A perfect dive,not a single fault!    
 Sophie and Tash begin to shout,       
 My goodness an amazing bout.          
 Mrs Cole gets the pair,               
 Grabbing both of them by the hair.    
 Sophie now gives many screams,        
 They both shoot out like lazer beams. 
 Mrs Cole in her daps,                 
 Gets out to many thunderous claps.    </content>
