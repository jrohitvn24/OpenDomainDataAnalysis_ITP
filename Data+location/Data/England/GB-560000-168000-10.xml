 the Science syllabus. There is        
 provision for teaching children who   
 find basic skills difficult.          
 At the end of this Summer Term several
 second year children will leave to go 
 to the selective grammar schools in   
 Dartford,and many more fourth year    
 children will leave to go to the      
 grammar schools in Gravesend.         
 Many members of staff give up their   
 own time to run extra-curricular      
 activities for the children. There is 
 a Parent Teacher Association which is 
 very supportive of the school and     
 raises funds to buy equipment. The    
 school spent a week of the Summer Term
 researching and producing work for the
 Domesday Project.                     </content>
