		<title>06LAW &amp; ORDER IN HAZLEMERE</title>
		<content>Hazlemere is a quiet residential area. 
sometimes things go wrong and we have a
local policeman to sort these things   
out.This policeman is called           
P.C.Burroughs. He is a foot            
policeman,but sometimes he rides his   
bike.P.C.Burroughs travels around alot,
as there is not much crime in the      
village.He occasionally visits our     
school to talk about the dangers of    
strangers,water and cycling.Sometimes  
there are groups of mods,skinheads,    
punks and rockers trying to act hard,  
but really they don't do any harm      
because they don't act like they look. 
P.C.Sorenson is the community policeman
in Holmer Green.His two main problems  
are petty vandalism and groups of      
teenagers who congregate around the    
pond and ride their motorbikes through 
the village.
