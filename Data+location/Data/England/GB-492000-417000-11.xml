		<title>11SURVEY OF LIFESTYLES 2</title>
		<content> We surveyed a cross section of people 
 about their lifestyle. We investigated
 their clothes, their hobbies, their   
 pets even what their houses were built
 of and how many people had labout     
 saving machines in either house or    
 garden. The size of the survey was 36 
 people. The people of Winterton have a
 fairly good standard of living equal  
 to most small towns in England. The   
 town is well laid out. It is a small  
 town north of Scunthorpe. It is a     
 mixture of old and new houses. There  
 are few busy streetsMost houses are   
 made of wood and stone or brick and   
 stone. 14% are pebbledash and 19% are 
 plastered. Most people have gardens to
 their houses. Machines make peoples'  
 lives a lot easier. There are 3       
 schools plus a playgroup. Most people 
 have hobbies taking up varying amounts
 of time.                              </content>
