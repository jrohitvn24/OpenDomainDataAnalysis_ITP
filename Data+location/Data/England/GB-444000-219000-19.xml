		<content>{Tackley Cricket Club}reformed in 1984 
 after a 20 year break. A square is    
 being made on the playing field. There
 are 40 members, aged 13 to 60. We play
 20 games a season against other       
 villages. The club hopes to enter the 
 local league in 1987.                 
                                       
                                       
{Tackley Football Club}saw its best    
 ever season in 1984/5. The first team 
 won promotion to {Division One} of the
 Witney and District League. The       
 Reserves missed promotion from        
 Division 4 by one point. Trevor Mason 
 scored 25 goals for the first         
 team,a club record.                   
 The club held an end of season dinner 
 dance at The King's Arms Hotel in     
 Bicester.
