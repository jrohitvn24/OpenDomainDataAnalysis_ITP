		<title>02Looking at Milton Common (1)</title>
		<content>  We began looking at the buildings    
from the London end and we saw Heath   
House, a big house with lots of        
windows. We counted 11 houses , and    
they were semi detached .I live in one 
of them .   There were 12 bungalows    
and some had been converted into       
houses . Some students live in one of  
them. There are three garages, one is  
a big shed where they mend and sell    
cars, another sells  motorbikes, and   
another also sells and  mends cars     
   There is a County Council Depot     
where my dad works. He salts the roads 
in winter and works on the motorway.   
There are two scrapyards, a water tower
and a stable block. Near the water     
tower is a public house called the     
Three Pigeons.
