 The first afternoon lesson was        
 geography. We were finishing off a    
 plan of our classroom, then, when we  
 had finished, we were to do a plan of 
 our bedroom. At playtime we played    
 catch. On the way to our next lesson  
 we saw a lackey moth caterpillar, then
 we did group reading. My book was     
 called the Sea-horses of the Far      
 Islands. Then just before home time we
 had the story of Captain Cobweb and   
 the Quoge.Then I rang the bell and got
 all my things together. Mummy met me  
 with Basil our dog. On the way home   
 Mummy told me that she had cancelled  
 the trip to an open air theatre       
 because the weather was so cold and   
 wet. The theatre play was the Merry   
 Wives of Windsor. When we got home I  
 had my tea. At 7pm I went to bed.     </content>
