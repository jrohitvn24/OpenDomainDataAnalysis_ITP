		<content>    A church has stood on the site for 
 well over{700 years}and there are     
 several parts still visible from      
 those early days. There are traces of 
 a Norman doorway in the south wall of 
 the chancel.                          
    The nave and the aisles are both   
 under one big roof but the chancel is 
 rather narrower. The chancel arch also
 dates from the Norman days but when   
 they built it they used some bricks   
 and tiles from an early Roman         
 building. The Roman villa had stood in
 Church Meadow.                        
    Lots of wall paintings were painted
 over during the days of Oliver        
 Cromwell but it may be possible to    
 uncover them again soon.              
    There is a big dug out chest in the
 church which was once used to collect 
 'St.Peter's Pence' which was money    
 sent to St.Peter's cathedral in Rome. </content>
