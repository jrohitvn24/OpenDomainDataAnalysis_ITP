		<content> The Newton Abbot area is well served  
 in some ways but poor in others. We   
 are very lucky to have areas of{open  
{space}and woods in which both         
 children and adults can get out into  
 the open air, play games, follow      
{nature trails}and see{wildlife}and    
{plants.}On the other hand children    
 always complain that there isn't      
 enough for them to do in the area,    
 especially when they get into their   
 'teen's and have to travel to         
 surrounding towns to find             
 entertainment. For adults there are   
 many groups to join and many          
 activities to follow but some         
 complain about the lack  of larger    
 town entertainment such as the theatre
 or ballet.The{Dyrons Centre}is used to
 provide both sporting and             
 entertainment for young and old alike.
