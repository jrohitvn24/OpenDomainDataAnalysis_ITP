		<content>             "MANDY"                   
  This is one of our counting out      
 rhymes.It is called "Mandy" and this  
 is it:- Milly, Molly, Mandy, sweet as 
 sugar candy, one two three you're it. 
                                       
            "SPUDS"                    
  This  is  how  we  count  out. It is 
 called "Spuds". You go:- 1 potato, 2  
 potato, 3 potato, 4. 5 potato, 6      
 potato, 7 potato more. You have to put
 your fists into a circle and you tap  
 the top of the fist when you say more.
 Whichever fist it lands on is put     
 behind that person's back. The        
 counting rhyme continues until there  
 is only one fist left in. The person  
 whose fist it is, is the first catcher
 or chaser in the game to be played. We
 say that he or she is "it".
