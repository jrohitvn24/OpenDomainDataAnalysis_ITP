		<content>  I woke up at half past six.I had     
 Weetabix for breakfast then I put on a
 tee_shirt,long trousers and bumper    
 shoes and walked to school.I did some 
 reading,singing and my workbook and   
 then I drew some birds for our bird   
 project.After play we went out to look
 for plants.I counted 25 different     
 plants in our school garden.          
  I had Cornish Pasty and potatoes for 
 school dinner.In the afternoon I made 
 a clay bird and did some sewing.Then  
 we had P.E.outside and finished with a
 story.We went home at 3.15p.m.        
  After school I played with Carl at   
 the farm. For tea I had tomato soup.  
 Then I played with Carl again and went
 on the Moorend with Mary and James.   
  I had a bath and went to bed at half 
 past eight. My Mum read a story and I 
 went to sleep at half past nine.
