		<content> On the Downs are traces of Bronze Age 
 Tumuli, defensive earthworks and field
 sustems and the ancient track of the  
 South Downs Way. There is also a more 
 recent Dewpond for watering sheep     
 which used to graze on the Downs.     
 Two roads parallel to the foot of the 
 Downs are only a few hundred yards    
 apart because of the 17th century     
 decision by the owners of Parham Park 
 to prevent the highway crossing their 
 land by building a second road with a 
 tollhouse which is still inhabited.The
 old gate into the park is still       
 remembered in the name 'Crossgates'   
 attached to a modern group of houses. 
 Charles 11 must have passed along this
 road in his escape after the Battle of
 Worcester.
