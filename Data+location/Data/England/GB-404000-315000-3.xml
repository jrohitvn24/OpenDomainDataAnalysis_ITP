		<title>03 BRERETON MAN'S DAY.</title>
		<content> My dad is an Area Manager for         
Stanton's Bakery. He gets up between   
seven and eight in the morning. He     
has to be at work before half past     
eight. He usually has Thursday and     
Sunday off but can change a day off    
to Wednesday. His job is to go         
around all the shops which are in      
his area. This used to be around       
Rugeley, Stafford and Lichfield but now
he's going up North. He travels in an  
Escort Popular car and drives about    
90-100 miles a day. He makes sure      
everything is alright in the shops.    
He finishes up at the bakery to check  
the takings. When he buys petrol or    
pays to go on a carpark he gets his    
money back from Stantons if he keeps   
his ticket. He often works until       
about 7.30pm.                          
                                       
                                       </content>
