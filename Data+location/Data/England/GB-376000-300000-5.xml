		<content> I like it when people put confetti on 
 you.When you get married you go to    
 Church in a nice car.The bridesmaids  
 sometimes go in the same car  as the  
 bride.People get married in Church    
 because they will stay together and   
 will be blessed by God.               
{The Altar:}The altar is a sort of     
 table. It has a rug over it and it    
 reminds us of Jesus from when he was  
 on the cross.Before it was used for   
 sacrifices and the blood used to go to
 the god to feed them.                 
{The Font.The}font is made of stone or}
 marble or lead.You will find them as  
 you walk through the door.In the 15th 
 century they made it with wood.The    
 Norman fonts were not like ours they  
 could move theirs about but we cannot 
 move ours.
