		<content> Whitwell Lodge is situated on a       
 peninsular of land jutting out into   
 Rutland Water,providing facilities for
 fly fishermen. Over 50,000 anglers    
 fish here during the season either    
 from the bank or a boat. Wardens are  
 on duty to give advice on tactics and 
 run courses for beginners.  Permits   
 are available and rules must be       
 adhered to.                           
 Club events and international and     
 national events are run here, and the 
 lodge contains a tackle shop and      
 lounge where refreshments can be      
 served.  There is also a room for     
 fish-gutting with a freezer for those 
 who come to spend some days fishing   
 before returning home.                
 Most seasons produce over 60,000 trout
 with an average weight of 2lbs. The   
 largest trout caught weighed over     
 12lbs.                                </content>
