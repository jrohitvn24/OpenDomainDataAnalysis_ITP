 Brownies, Guides and Cubs are active  
 in Longstanton; the nearest Scout     
 troops are at Bar Hill and Swavesey. {
{Brownies}have existed here since 1953 
 when  two teachers from the school    
 started the pack. There are at present
 about 25 members. Recent activities   
 have included a London trip, a        
 bonfire, and ice skating and a disco  
 with the Cubs.{The Guide company}     
 was revived in 1983 by another        
 teacher. It is struggling to maintain 
 its initial momentum. In this 75th    
 Anniversary year of Guiding the       
 company has had a London trip and is  
 camping this summer.{The Cub Pack}is  
 very lively. Formed last year on the  
 initiative of parents, it has about 20
 members. This year there have been    
 weekend camps, a day spent at         
 Lowestoft, and various other outings. </content>
