		<title>18HAND MADE BRICKS (MARKS TEY)</title>
		<content>{W.H.Collier}have been making bricks at
 Marks Tey since{1863.}The bricks are  
 very special because they are all hand
 made.They started making bricks here  
 because there is the right kind of    
 clay and it is in a deep layer.The pit
 is{70}feet deep.Mr.Catchpole(The      
 director)says he expects the clay to  
 last until the beginning of the next  
 century.By adding{20%}sand to the     
 mixture they can make the clay last   
 even longer. All sorts of bricks are  
 made and some have strange names like 
 bullnose, cants, squints, birds       
 mouthes and saddleback. The clay is   
 put into wooden (beech) moulds and    
 then put on racks to dry for 10 days. 
 The unbaked bricks are called green   
 bricks. They are put in a tunnel kiln 
 which takes 30 carts each of 400 to   
 600 bricks.They are fired at 1040 d.C.
 3 million bricks are made each year.  </content>
