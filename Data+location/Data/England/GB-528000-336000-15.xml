		<title>15The Parish Church - Kirton</title>
		<content> Kirton Parish Church is on Willington 
 Road off the A16. It was built around 
 1145 but in the early 19th century    
 part of the church was demolished     
 because it was in a bad state of      
 disrepair. It used to be a cross      
 shaped church but now it is no longer 
 in the shape of a cross. Since 1980   
 the vicar has been Peter Richard      
 Hodgson. The church itself is about   
 100 feet long and the tower is around 
 90 feet tall. There are eight bells   
 but only one can be rung because the  
 others are not safe. At the moment    
 there are more than eighty new        
 hassocks and two hundred and ten      
 chairs. The church is mostly built of 
 stone but the roof is made of oak with
 lead on the outside.There is one      
 service every Sunday and one on       
 Thursday mornings,also a joint service
 at the Methodist Church each month.   </content>
