		<content>      The villages of Pebworth and Long
 Marston and hamlet of Broad Marston   
 lie on the borders of the 3 counties  
 of Worcester, Warwick and Gloucester. 
 Since l932 Pebworth and Broad Marston 
 have been administered by Worcester   
 County Council but Gloucester County  
 Council still owns houses, farms and  
 considerable land. Long Marston is    
 administered by Warwick County        
 Council. The settlements lie between  
 Evesham and Stratford, south of the   
 River Avon. The gently undulating land
 is intensively farmed. The Army       
 Engineers Store Depot, built in l940, 
 lies on the western border. There are 
 no major roads but a railway line,    
 serving the camp and a scrap metal    
 firm passes north west to south. The  
 population, approximately l,000, will 
 remain stable  as development is      
 prohibited for the next eight years.  </content>
