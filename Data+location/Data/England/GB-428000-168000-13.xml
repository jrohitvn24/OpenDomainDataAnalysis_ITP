		<content> On Tuesday 16th of July we went to    
 Littlecote house.                     
    When we got there we were met by a 
 guide.                                
    The first room that we went into   
 looked most exciting                  
            {"The Great Hall"          
 This room had a very tall ceiling.I   
 looked around the walls of the room.  
 Covering one whole wall was a set of  
 about twenty flintlock guns.There were
 also some beautiful round shields and 
 some leather tunics.They are a full   
 set of Roundhead uniforms which       
{Colonel Popham}had made for his       
{Roundhead army.}After the Civil War,  
 they were put in an attic and         
 forgotten. They were found years      
 later and are now the best collection 
 of Cromwellian{armour}in Britain.     
     Then the guide asked us if we     
 would turn round to look at a painting</content>
