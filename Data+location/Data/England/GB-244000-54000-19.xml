		<title>19TAKE_AWAY_FOOD</title>
		<content> There are quite a lot of take-away    
 food shops in the Keyham area. There  
 are fish and chip shops, and Chinese  
 and Indian 'take-aways'. Our mums and 
 dads can remember when there were just
 fish and chip shops. At the Golden    
 Boat, a chinese 'take-away', the food 
 is prepared by two people. They are   
 open every day of the week between    
 17.30 and 23.30. Most of the meals    
 consist of chicken, prawns or beef,   
 chinese vegetables such as beanshoots 
 and rice or noodles. Some people      
 prefer chips to rice. Popular dishes  
 are curries, sweet and sour and chop  
 suey. We did a survey and found that  
 many people have a 'take-away' between
 once and four times a month. The      
 Indian 'take-away' is used mostly by  
 sailors, who are used to foreign food,
 and so a new branch has just been     
 opened outside the dockyard gates.    </content>
