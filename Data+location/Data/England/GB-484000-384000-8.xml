		<title>08Upton Church</title>
		<content>  In 1845 when Archdeacon Stonehouse   
 visited the church he noticed that it 
 was in great need of repair.However it
 appears from recorded evidence that no
 major restoration work was carried out
 until 1867 when it is stated in the   
 Parish records that the state ot the  
 church was lamentable.However         
 substantial repairs were undertaken by
 the architect Evan Christian at the   
 cost of Â£1,000.Parts of the walls were
 rebuilt as well as the chapel arch,a  
 new roof was put on the nave and the  
 tower masonry was re-pointed.The old  
 pews were unfortunately removed and   
 new ones provided.                    
 Seven years later the old North aisle 
 was re-opened under the direction of  
 James Fowler of{Louth.}In 1880 the    
 Tower was eventually repaired.The     
 costs of the work between 1874 and    
 1880 was Â£3,495.                      </content>
