		<content>   {Little Sandhurst}has really only   
 developed since the 1960's. We did a  
 survey and found that{53%}of those    
 returning the questionnaire lived in  
 houses built in that decade. {19%}    
 lived in houses built in the 1970's   
 and {12%}in houses built in this      
 decade.  The returns also showed that{
{62%}of the people lived in detached   
 houses and {23%}in semi-detached. The 
 remainder were divided between        
 bungalows, flats and a "cover all"    
 section called "Other".               
  Although the majority of people live 
 in houses built within the last thirty
 years, there were some older homes    
 identified in the returns. The oldest 
 of these was built in 1710, and we had
 three houses which were built in the  
 late Nineteenth Century.  Only {12%}  
 of the homes were built between 1900  
 and 1959.                             </content>
