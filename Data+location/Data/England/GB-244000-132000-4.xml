{Sea walls}were built in{1815}and{1857}
 and{Horsey Island}was reclaimed. The  
 sea wall (bank) was built with clay   
 and pebble into which pitch _ paving  
 was driven. This bank was broken in   
 December{1910}and hundreds of sheep   
 were drowned.                         
  {Commander Gammon's}talk reminded us 
 of the surge tide of{October 26th 1984
 when part of{Crow Point}was washed    
 away by a ferocious gale. Fortunately,
 the wall is now able to withstand a   
 surge tide but, on that day many      
 houses and cars were flooded in{      
{Barnstaple.}({Mr Little,}our teacher's
 car was flooded too!).
