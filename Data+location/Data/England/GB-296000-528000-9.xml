		<title>09The River Derwent</title>
		<content> The part of the river in our Block is 
 the{estuary}which is tidal. This river
 reputedly the fastest in England rises
 at Springling Tarn below the Scafell  
 Mountain range at some 3206 feet above
 sea level and within 30 miles meets   
 the sea at Workington. Where the river
 and the sea meet, the estuary is in   
 great danger of{silting up}and it is  
 necessary for the Port of Workington  
 Authority to maintain the sea lane to 
 the Prince of Wales Dock by regular   
 dredging. The River Derwent is a      
 famous salmon fishing river and       
 subject to the activities of{poachers 
 who attempt to net, hook and use      
 explosives to catch the salmon. In    
 1984 over 390 poachers were           
 successfully convicted. In our Block  
 there are three{bridges,}one for the  
 A596 road, the railway and a combined 
 dock railway and foot bridge.         </content>
