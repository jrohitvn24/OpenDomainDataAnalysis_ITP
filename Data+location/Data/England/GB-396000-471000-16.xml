		<content> Wharfedale House - Once a private     
 house, this was bought by a group of  
 Huddersfield men, Round Tablers, etc. 
 who ran a marathon and other efforts  
 to found a hostel which formerly      
 helped deprived or maladjusted        
 children to enjoy the countryside.    
 Now, with a resident warden and wife, 
 it caters for groups from the Kirklees
 area.                                 
 Within the community, a variety of    
 activities takes place, with emphasis 
 on the period October to March. There 
 is a W.I., a Badminton Club,          
 Horticultural Society, an annual      
 bonfire, children's party, with home  
 produced pantomime, charity fancy     
 dress evenings, fell and canoe races, 
 darts and domino teams, rugby and     
 cricket enthusiasts, carol singing to 
 nearby hamlets, and impromptu dancing 
 round the Maypole on New Year's Eve.  </content>
