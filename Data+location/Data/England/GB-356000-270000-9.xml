		<content> The area includes  a wide range of    
 habitatsfor example,arable fields,    
 woods, rough ground, and streams. It  
 is drained by the Lledwyche brook into
 which run smaller streams which form a
 network of wetlands, where interesting
 species of plants and animals can     
 survive. The landscape is undulating  
 with a variation in height from about 
 76 metres by the brook, rising to 200 
 metres on the lower slopes of         
 Titterstone Clee Hill.The underlying  
 soils are of Devonian and Silurian    
 origin with some Carboniferous shales.
 They are mostly loamy and silty       
 sandstones with some marl, dolorite,  
 and limestone. The fauna and flora are
 thus many and varied, but mainly      
 restricted to hedgerows, stream sides,
 and woods, since most of the area is  
 extensively farmed.     CONTINUED ON
