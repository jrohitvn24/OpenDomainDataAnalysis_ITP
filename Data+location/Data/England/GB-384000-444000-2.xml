		<title>02FARMING AROUND BARNOLDSWICK</title>
		<content>  My name is Keith. I live on a 100    
acre farm near Barnoldswick. My farm   
is typical of the farms in this area.  
The land is mainly pasture and meadow  
for cows but we keep some sheep on the 
rougher grazing.                       
  Our stone built farmhouse is about   
100 years old but many in the area are 
much older. Our outbuildings include:  
cubicles, silo, milking parlour, calf  
shed, hen hut and garage.              
  Most farmers in this area concentrate
on milk production from herds of       
friesian cows,although one or two do   
keep a few beef cattle.                
  Farm-bottled milk is quite common    
with many farmers having their own milk
rounds.Any surplus milk is sold to the 
Milk Marketing Board.                  
  On the poorer grassland some farmers 
keep flocks of sheep.
