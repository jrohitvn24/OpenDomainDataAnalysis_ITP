		<title>15Traffic in Sheering</title>
		<content> The main road called{The Street       
 carries traffic to the villages       
 between Harlow and Chelmsford. Most of
 the vehicles are cars. There are some 
 vans and light lorries. The busiest   
 times of the day are the rush hours at
 8.00 a.m. and 6.00 p.m. In the morning
 the cars are mostly going towards     
 Harlow.                               
 The road through Lower Sheering       
 carries local traffic only.           
 The{M11 Motorway}was built 10 years   
 ago.  It goes between London and      
 Cambridge. In the morning most of the 
 traffic is going into London but by   
 the middle of the day it is going     
 towards Cambridge and most of it is   
 commercial vehicles. We cannot get    
 onto the M11 at Sheering. The nearest 
 junction is at Harlow.
