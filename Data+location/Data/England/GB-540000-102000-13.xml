		<title>13Telscombe  'Years of Change'</title>
		<content>  Little has changed since 1918 when   
Miss Gregory moved into Telscombe.     
  Four cottages were built in the early
1920's and a barn has been converted to
a house.                               
 The village school built to accomodate
24 pupils closed in the early 1960's.  
Miss Gregory told us that one stayed at
the village school for all of one's    
school life unless (like her) one won a
place at Lewes Grammar school.         
  The village has only been served by  
local buses since the 1980's so most   
people have their own transport.       
  Before the Second World War most of  
the village was involved in Racing     
stables, the training gallops being on 
the Downs. However during the war the  
Downs were ploughed up for food        
production unfortunately this brought a
lot of flints to the surface, making it
unusable for the horses.               </content>
