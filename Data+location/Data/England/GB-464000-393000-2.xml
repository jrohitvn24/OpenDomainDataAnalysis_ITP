 boundary where S.Yorks meets          
 Nottinghamshire.  The populstion of   
 2,300 has been steadily increasing for
 several years and thus there are new  
 housing developments.  A new, private 
 estate is being erected by a local    
 firm close to the New Hall and Health 
 Centre.  Opposite these is a row of   
 listed ,old cottages and the modern   
 library.                              
  Bawtry can trace its origins to a    
 charter of 1199. It became important  
 in the 17th. Century as a port on the 
 River Idle,a tributary of the Trent,  
 and also later as a trading centre due
 to its position on the Great North    
 Road.There are numerous clubs         
 including football and cricket clubs, 
 amateur dramatics,Brownies,Guides,Cubs
 and Scouts.A high proportion of       
 professional people live in the town. </content>
