		<title>10RUISLIP RAILWAY DEPOT</title>
		<content>  Ruislip Depot is on the central line 
 and was built before the war as part  
 of the London Passenger Transport     
 Board's 1935-40 programme of          
 improvements, and during the war was  
 requisitioned by the admiralty. There 
 are two main buildings in the depot: a
 large one for the repair of rolling   
 stock and in which examination        
 inspections are carried out and a     
 smaller shed called the cleaning shed.
 The cleaning shed contains three      
 'roads' long enough for an eight car  
 train.The washing machine is contained
 in a small building a short distance  
 from the end of the cleaning shed.    
 Trains from the shed are driven at    
 walking pace through the machine. In  
 the machine water jets clean the cars 
 while motor driven felt strips wipe   
 off the dirt. Along the south side of 
 the shed are offices etc.             </content>
