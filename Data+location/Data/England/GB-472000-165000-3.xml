		<title>03A LOCAL FARM (PART 2)</title>
		<content> HE HAS THREE DIFFERENT SOIL TYPES ON  
 HIS FARM,THEY ARE GRAVEL,MEDIUM LOAM, 
 AND CLAY.HE USES COW'S MUCK,POTASH,   
 AND NITROGEN AS FERTILISER.THE MAIN   
 PESTS HE HAS ON THE FARM ARE FLIES AND
 RABBITS.THE FLIES IRRITATE THE COWS SO
 THAT THEY USE A LOT OF ENERGY TRYING  
 TO SHAKE THEM OFF,WHICH SHOULD BE USED
 FOR MAKING MILK.THE RABBITS EAT A     
 LARGE AMOUNT OF GRASS AND ARE         
 INCREASING IN NUMBER.THE FARMER       
 MENTIONED THAT 1985 IS THE FIRST YEAR 
 THAT HE HASN'T SEEN A RABBIT WITH     
 MYXOMATOSIS,WHICH HAS KILLED MANY     
 RABBITS IN THE PAST.THERE ARE A COUPLE
 OF DISEASES ON THE FARM WHICH ARE     
 MASTITIS AND FOUL OF THE FOOT.ONE     
 OTHER PROBLEM HE HAS ON THE FARM IS   
 THE WEATHER.THE FARMER FINDS THE COLD 
 AND RAINY WEATHER THE WORST PART OF   
 FARMING AND HE FINDS THE HOT AND SUNNY
 WEATHER THE BEST PART OF FARMING.     </content>
