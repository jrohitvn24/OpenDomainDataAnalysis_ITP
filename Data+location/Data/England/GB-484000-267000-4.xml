		<content>{HIGHFIELD LODGE (CONT)                
 The sheep are crossed Suffolk (males) 
 and Masham (females). The owners keep 
 a few other animals, such as beef     
 cattle, hens and horses. There are no 
 crops on this farm. It got its name   
 from the height of the ground compared
 with the surrounding area.            
{APPLEBY LODGE}had 1000 acres, but     
 recently 200 of them were sold to the 
 Wellingborough Park Farm Industrial   
 Estate development. It is a mixed farm
 with 200 bullocks, 100 cows and 320   
 ewes. The lambs produced are crossed  
 Jacobs and Masham. The farmer also    
 grows rape, barley, oats, wheat,      
 potatoes, swedes and tomatoes.        
                                       
 All three farms have existed for a    
 long time and are at present relying  
 on members of the family, mainly for  
 the labour.                           </content>
