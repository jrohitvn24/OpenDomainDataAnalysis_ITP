		<title>01Breckland village</title>
		<content> Oxborough is a small village on the   
 edge of Breckland of about eighty     
 flint and brick houses, mainly grouped
 round the green.  Although only a few 
 of the magnificent well grown trees of
 earlier days remain, some still shade 
 the reen and the cottages that ring   
 it.  Inspite of its size Oxborough    
 still retains its shop/postoffice, pub
 and picturesque part-ruined church    
 with its terra-cotta work.  To the    
 North East the little river Gadder    
 flos under the road to feed the moat  
 of Oxburgh Hall,a find old house      
 the home of the Beddingfeld family for
 nearly five hundred years and now in  
 the care of the National Trust.  Two  
 farms border the village, growing     
 sugar/beet and grain, both retaining  
 most of their hedges in their wide    
 fields, for this is shooting country, 
 where pheasants and partridges abound </content>
