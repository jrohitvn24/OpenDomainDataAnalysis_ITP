		<content>   When people come to live in{Clifton-
{on-Teme}they soon realise that we have
 a wide variety of{weather.}We often   
 have heavy{snowfalls}in the winter and
 it is usual for the village to be cut 
 off for a day or two. There are often 
 deep{snowdrifts}on the roads into the 
 village and the hills near{Clifton}and
{Upper Sapey}are often blocked by big  
 vehicles unable to move on the{icy    
{roads.}The{River Teme}reacts very     
 quickly to heavy{rainfall}and there   
 are times when the{floods}have        
 prevented cars using{Ham bridge.      
    There are often{gale force winds}on
 the exposed hills and these have been 
 known to cause considerable damage.   
    The {weather }is not aways bad     
 because, being quite high up, the area
 has fine{sunny weather}when Worcester 
 is covered in autumn mists.
