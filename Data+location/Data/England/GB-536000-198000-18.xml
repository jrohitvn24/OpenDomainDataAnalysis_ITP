		<title>18MY HOME TOWN</title>
		<content> I live in a street called{Thaxted Way,
 in Waltham Abbey. It is very quiet and
 still in our street, and there are    
 lots of{trees.                        
 In the centre of the town, there is a 
{Town Hall,}and at the side of the     
 building there is a{river}where we go 
{fishing.}Last weekend my dad took     
 Sarah, Rebecca, and myself fishing. We
 caught 10 small fish, which we took   
 home and put into our pond.           
 In Waltham Abbey there are only a few 
{shops,}the council should build a     
 large{supermarket}in the town.
