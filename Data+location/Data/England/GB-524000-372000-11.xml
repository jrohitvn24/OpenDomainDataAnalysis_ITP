		<title>11Sailbord Hire in West Ashby</title>
		<content> Robin and Margaret Francis of "East   
 Lincs Marine" have hired the gravel   
 pits for sailboard hire and tuition as
 well as fishing. There are five       
 stretches of water on 30 acres. An 8  
 acre lake is used for sailboarding and
 there are hopes of extending this and 
 building a clubhouse. The water is    
 stocked with roach,rudd,perch,bream,  
 chubb and pike.There are plans to int-
 roduce carp and tench.Wildlife abounds
 at the gravel pits, and some of the   
 birds to inhabit the area include     
 swans,canadian greyleg and barnacle   
 geese,shoveller and shell duck,widgeon
 teal,malard,grebe,wagtail,plover,terns
 and coots.There are lots of insects in
 this unpolluted sanctuary, and Mr.    
 Francis was recently delighted to spot
 a kingfisher.The amenity area of the  
 gravel pit is open every day from     
 10a.m. until dusk.                    </content>
