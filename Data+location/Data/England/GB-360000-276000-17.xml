		<content> The names of the three villages in our
 area are Hopton Doddington and        
 Cleeton, all show that they were      
 Anglo-Saxon settlements. Hopton means 
 a village in a valley. Cleeton means a
 village on Clee Hill . The old village
 near cleeton  gate was deserted and a 
 new one was built by George           
 Pardoe,further up the hill in 1870.   
 One of the landmarks in our area is   
 the Three Forked Pole which points to 
 three different parishs Hopton,       
 Bitterly, and Coreley.It has stood    
 there for hundreds of years and has   
 recently been renewed.There was a     
 thirving paper-making industry in     
 Hopton.Rags were brought from Bewdley 
 and made into paper in mills situated 
 on Hopton Brook behind the Manor      
 House.
