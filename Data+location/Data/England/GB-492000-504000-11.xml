		<title>11FARMING IN FYLINGDALES</title>
		<content> MACHINERY. In Fylingdales the small   
 farms have about 60 acres. The bigger 
 farms have about 200 acres and the    
 largest farms about 350 acres.        
 All our local farms have at least two 
 or three tractors. Over the years they
 have become bigger and more powerful  
 so they can pull heavy machinery. It  
 is hard land to farm because of the   
 deep valleys and the close proximity  
 to the moors.                         
 The farmers have different kinds of   
 machinery, to prepare the soil, plant 
 and harvest crops, to dig ditches and 
 cut the hedgerows, to make silage and 
 hay, to spread fertilizers and control
 weeds and pests.                      
 They also have trailers to carry crops
 and hay, elevators and milking        
 machines which all help the farmer.
