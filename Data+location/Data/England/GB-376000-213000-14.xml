		<content>     The Severn Bore comes once a month
 and the best places to see it are :   
 Weir Green, Elmore Back and Stonebench
 . Stonebench got its name from rocks  
 that lie on the bed of the river and  
 when the ships came through it ripped 
 their keels . The Severn Bore is      
 biggest and best seen in mid_winter   
 and has been known to flood many times
 . In 1947 there was a very big flood .
 It flooded most of Elmore and the     
 water went right up to Shard House .  
     The Pilot Inn was opened in 1827  
 and it has always been an inn. It is  
 situated nearly on the canal bank .   
 The canal itself used to have         
 approximately 30_40 ships a day and   
 they carried 300_400 tonnes . Nowadays
 they have three or four ships a week  
 and their cargo is at least 1000      
 tonnes . They stop at the B.P. Oil    
 Terminal ,which is closing down.      </content>
