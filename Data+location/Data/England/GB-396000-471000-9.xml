		<title>09KETTLEWELL - DAIRY FARMING</title>
		<content>   Dairy farming is an important part  
 of agriculture though most dairy herds
 are now kept to the lower end of the  
 valley.  They are fairly small and    
 consist of Friesian cows.  The milk is
 taken by tanker to the Milk Marketing 
 Board depots but some of it is sold   
 retail around the villages.  Cows are 
 grazed in the valley bottoms, but dry 
 cows and younger animals are often    
 summered on the hills.  Hay is the    
 main winter fodder but silage is also 
 made and fed, with concentrates,      
 throughout the year to lactating cows.
 Calves are bred and reared to both    
 supplement the dairy herd and to sell 
 for store cattle.  There are also     
 several small suckler herds in the    
 area, chiefly Hereford and Charolais  
 breeds.  Grass is the only crop and it
 is grown for hay and silage for sheep 
 and cattle.  Pigs are not now kept.   </content>
