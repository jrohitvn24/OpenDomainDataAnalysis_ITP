 Oakridge is a small residential       
 Cotswold village.There is an old mill 
 and a forge which is open to the      
 public as a sort of museum.The        
 Blacksmith does ornamental ironwork   
 but doesn't shoe horses.              
    Oakridge is not an industrial      
 place.The only shop is the Post       
 Office,which is also a village store. 
 For worship there is the church which 
 holds one service on a Sunday,at 10.30
 a.m.The church (St. Bartholomew) has a
 sundial above the main door.          
     There is a two-hourly bus service 
 to Stroud from outside the school.The 
 railway line runs close by the village
 but there is no station,although a    
 former chairman of British Rail lived 
 in the village.The Village Hall is    
 situated on the side of the playing   
 field.There is only one public house. </content>
