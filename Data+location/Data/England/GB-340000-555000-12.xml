 Until the Beeching cuts of the 1960's,
 seven lines ran into Carlisle.The Wav-
 erly route to Edinburgh and the       
 Silloth line were closed then. The    
 fate of the dramatic trans-Pennine    
 Settle &amp; Carlisle line depends upon   
 the outcome of a public inquiry not   
 yet held. Few tears were shed over the
 failures of the APT, which was not    
 initially planned to stop in Carlisle.
 Second class{Saver}fares make rail    
 travel attractive, though crowded,    
 noisy, open-plan carriages, albeit    
 with air-conditioning, and the smell  
 from the brakes, can be irritating.
