		<content> In such a sparsely populated rural    
 area agriculture is the main source of
 employment. Family-owned or tenanted  
 farms, worked by the owner/tenant with
 help from family, predominate.        
 Amalgamation of land into bigger      
 farms results in the freeing of some  
 houses for sale. These are usually    
 bought by urban workers from outside  
 the area who commute daily to large   
 conurbations. Their wives work        
 part-time locally as doctors          
 receptionists, nursing aids in homes  
 for elderly persons, as homehelps or  
 in various capacities in schools.     
 There is a small horse-training       
 stable. A farmers wife runs an art    
 gallery. She attends rural shows both 
 locally and nationally, selling prints
 and original paintings.
