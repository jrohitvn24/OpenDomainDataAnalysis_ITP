		<title>16KEEPING PIGEON'S.</title>
		<content> My hobby is keeping pigeons.Pigeons   
 are birds,I keep them in our shed in  
 the back garden.I let them out every  
 morning and shut them up and them at  
 night.They eat Belgium mixed corn that
 costs Â£4.00 for a big sack.That lasts 
 about 1 month at the most.You need    
 sand and gravel.I have 7 pigeons and  
 and 5 cages.2 pigeons are paired so   
 they live in the same cage.The only   
 job I dont like doing is cleaning them
 out,I hate that job so I let my dad do
 it or anybody but me. I breed them.My 
 dad's frend has got 40 pigeons and 36 
 baby chicks.To get them in you just   
 rattle a tin with corn in or they just
 come in when they are hungry if you   
 feed them in the morning they don't   
 come back.   BY DAVID PRICE
