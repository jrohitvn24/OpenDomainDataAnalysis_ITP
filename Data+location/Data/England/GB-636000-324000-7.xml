		<content> in St.Benet's.  The estates are       
 compact to avoid loss of prime arable 
 land and built around Stalham because 
 of the relatively wide range of       
 amenities found there.  Equally       
 important are the numbers of retired  
 people who settle in the area and the 
 provision made for the elderly and/or 
 infirm at Portalfields, Robert Smith  
 Court and Sydney House.               
 The pattern of house-building is      
 however, different in the rest of the 
 D-Block.  Here agriculture dominates  
 and houses are few and far between- as
 in the widely dispersed parishes of   
 Brumstead, East Ruston and Ingham.    
 This also means that the amenities are
 far less concentrated than in Stalham,
 and less attractive to one-car        
 families where the husband needs it   
 during the day, leaving the wife as a 
 prisoner in the home.                 </content>
