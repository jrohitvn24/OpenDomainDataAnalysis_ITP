 The land round Spaldwick is very flat 
 which makes it good farming land.There
 are a few cattle.Most of the land is  
 now used for growing crops but there  
 was previously some cattle.Many ponds 
 have been filled in because they are  
 no longer needed for cattle.The fields
 round Spaldwick are big.Every year    
 more hedges are pulled out.It is a lot
 easier to use  a combine-harvester on 
 a big field than it is on a small     
 field.Mr Ivorysfields vary between    
 eight to ninetysix acres.There are    
 two main problemsin farming,the clay  
 soil and the drainage of water.The    
 main crops are Rape,Wheat and         
 Barley.Fifteen yearsago Mr Ivory grew 
 potatoes but now he grows Rape.
