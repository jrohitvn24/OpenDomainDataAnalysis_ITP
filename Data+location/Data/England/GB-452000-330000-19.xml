		<title>19EVENTS-TORNADO HITS GOTHAM.</title>
		<content> Trees were uprooted or broken off and 
 carried across the fields outside the 
 village.There was danger from escaping
 gas and the Gas Board had to do       
 emergency repairs.A man who had bought
 a new car only that week found it     
 scratched and battered by falling     
 debris.People had to be evacuated from
 their homes until they could be made  
 safe.One old lady had a lucky         
 escape.She normally went to bed early,
 but for some reason had delayed on    
 Thursday. The tornado caused the      
 ceiling of her bedroom to collapse and
 her bed was completely covered in     
 bricks and rubble.
