		<content>   Capel is on the A20 above the "White
 Cliffs of Dover",between Dover and    
 Folkestone. Before the A20 was built  
 the main road was the Old Dover Road  
 which goes along the edge of the      
 cliff.There is a garage and a small   
 cliff top cafe on this road.Back on   
 the main road there is a general      
 store, the local police house and a   
 large garage.                         
   Capel Street is the main village    
 street. On it is another general store
 and next door a hairdresser's. Further
 along is the butcher's and the Post   
 Office.Just past this is the local    
 school. On Lancaster Avenue there is  
 the Village Hall and the recreation   
 ground,with swings ,a slide and a     
 climbing frame.                       
   Capel has no doctor, dentist or     
 public house.
