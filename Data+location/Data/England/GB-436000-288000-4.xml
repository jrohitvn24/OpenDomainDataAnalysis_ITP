		<content> On Monday 6th June between 1.35 and   
 1.50 we did a traffic survey on the   
 roads leading to the big roundabout at
 the Arches. Coton Road, which is a    
 dual carriageway, was the busiest with
 a total of 359 vehicles(275 cars,32   
 vans,27 lorries,11 motorbikes,3       
 buses,1 coach,3 mopeds,1 ambulance and
 1 dustcart.) The Ringroad was the next
 busiest with 358 vehicles.Avenue      
 Road,outside our school,had 236       
 vehicles.The quietest road was        
 Coventry Road with only 89 vehicles.  
 This was once the main road.We also   
 decided to discover at random where 50
 cars in the survey had been           
 registered.20 were registered in      
 Warwickshire or The West Midlands,9 in
 Leicestershire,18 in other English    
 places,1 in Ireland,1 in Wales and one
 was a temporary resident.
