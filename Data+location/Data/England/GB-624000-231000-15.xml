		<title>15HARWICH'S WEEKLY NEWSPAPER</title>
		<content>    THE HARWICH AND MANNINGTREE        
 STANDARD WAS FIRST PUBLISHED IN 1872. 
 IT HAS BEEN IN PUBLICATION FOR WELL   
 OVER 100 YEARS. THE PRESENT OFFICE IS 
 IN DOVERCOURT HIGH STREET AND WAS     
 BUILT ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO.   EVERY    
 WEEK 7500 COPIES OF THE STANDARD ARE  
 PRINTED ALTHOUGH IT EXPECTS TO SELL   
 ABOUT 7000. THERE IS ALSO A LOCAL     
 EVENING NEWSPAPER WHICH COVERS THE    
 COLCHESTER AND N.E.ESSEX AREA AS WELL 
 AS HARWICH; BOTH PAPERS ARE PRINTED IN
 COLCHESTER.                           
    THE STANDARD USUALLY RECEIVES      
 BETWEEN TEN AND FIFTEEN LETTERS EACH  
 WEEK.  MOST CORRESPONDENTS WRITE      
 FAVOURABLY ABOUT THE ARTICLES         
 PUBLISHED. THE  JOURNALIST INTERVIEWED
 FELT THAT COURT CASES AND GOSSIP      
 TYPE ARTICLES WERE THE MOST POPULAR.  
 FOR MANY HOUSEBOUND AND ELDERLY THIS  
 WAS THEIR LINK WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD.</content>
