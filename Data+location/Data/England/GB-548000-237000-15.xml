		<content>  {Hedgerows}are disappearing with     
 farmers cutting them down.They do this
 to make their fields larger.The       
 hedgerows shade the edge of his fields
 so that his crop not grow there.The   
 removal of the hedgerows also         
 increases the overall price of the    
 farm.If they are removed it is easier 
 for the large machinery to manoeuvre  
 about.It will also stop birds,rodents 
 and animals eating their crops.In     
 place of the hedgerows wooden stakes  
 would be put in the ground and barbed 
 wire would be strung between the      
 posts.The hedgerows are made up of    
 hawthorn bushes and should not be     
 destroyed for the sake of the
