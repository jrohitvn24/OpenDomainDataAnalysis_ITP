		<content> Norton-on-Derwent is a progressive and
 expanding town situated to the south  
 of the river Derwent and halfway      
 between York and Scarborough. It lies,
 approximately, midway between the     
 North Yorkshire Moors and the         
 Yorkshire Wolds forming a district of 
 6500 people.                          
                                       
 Norton-on-Derwent is connected to the 
 adjoining town of Malton by two road  
 bridges. In 1974, the year of local   
 government reorganisation, the town of
 Norton was renamed Norton-on Derwent  
 to avoid confusion with the many other
 places bearing the same name.         
                                       
 As anyone in Norton-on-Derwent will be
 quick to point out, both Malton bus   
 and railway stations are in Norton.The
 many famous horses trained in Malton  
 are again from stables in Norton.     </content>
