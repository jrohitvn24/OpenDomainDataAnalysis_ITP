		<title>01CATON,BROOKHOUSE+LITTLEDALE</title>
		<content>The parish of Caton-with-Littledale is 
found 7 kilometres east of Lancaster,  
in an area of outstanding natural      
beauty.There are around 1200 homes.    
The land slopes north from Clougha Pike
and Wardstone to the wooded valley of  
Artlebeck,rising again to Caton Moor,  
then descending to the River Lune.Much 
is farm land.The valley consists of    
good pasture land which is used for    
dairy cattle,whilst the hills,which    
are rocky,are used for sheep and beef  
farming.Most of the dwellings are in   
the valley adjacent to the River Lune  
in the two communities of Caton and    
Brookhouse.They serve as dormitories   
for Lancaster and other towns.         
Littledale is a farming community in   
the hills where nearly all the         
inhabitants are related to each other.
