		<title>15IRON WORKS - ASHDOWN FOREST</title>
		<content>   A number of sites remain on the     
 fringes of Ashdown Forest which show  
 the intensive activity of the Wealden 
 Iron Industry at its zenith from the  
 late 15th century to the mid-18th     
 century.                              
   Many ponds and streams remain in the
 area, particularly from the time of   
 the first Blast Furnace (with         
 water-powered bellows) at Cotchford   
 and Tilt Hammer at Newbridge Mills.   
   A tributory of the River Medway runs
 through both sites, and Pippingford   
 Furnace and Forge have been excavated 
 and the Hammer pond, Bay and a Leat   
 for the waterwheel are still present. 
 Newbridge Mill has its hammer pond and
 leats, at Cotchford and Parrock       
 remains of furnace ponds and bays, and
 all sites have both cinder and slag in
 adjacent fields. Pits for iron        
 ore are found throughout the area.    </content>
