		<content> On Wednesday 8th.May 1985,the Rector  
 got up and had breakfast,then he came 
 down to Cradley School to take our    
 morning assembly.He usually reads a   
 piece from the Bible and then we sing 
 a hymn. After this he went to Colwall 
 to a meeting of church people.After   
 this he went to Worcester at 1.30p.m. 
 to the crematorium for a funeral      
 service.Then he went to the hospital  
 to visit two people from this parish. 
 Then he went home for tea.He will eat 
 almost anything,having been in the    
 Merchant Navy.Then he went to a V.E.  
 Day service as it was the 40th        
 anniversary of V.E. Day.Then he went  
 on a home visit to discuss Baptism.   
 Most of all he cares about people.He  
 hopes that in the future all the      
 churches will unite as one.
