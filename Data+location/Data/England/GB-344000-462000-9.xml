		<content> The area now called Morecambe once    
 comprised 3 villages Bare, Torrisholme
 and Poulton. The only industries were 
 fishing and farming. Morecambe is  now
 a {holiday resort}and most employment 
 in the town is directly or indirectly 
 reliant on tourism.There are hundreds 
 of hotels, large and small holiday    
 flats cafes and many other businesmen 
 defendant on the holiday trade.Since  
 the 1950s, however there has been a   
 gradual decline in the holiday trade  
 and many  hotels and holiday flats    
 open out of season to provide         
 accomotation for lancaster university 
 students and construction workers from
 the nearby Heysham Nuclear Power      
 station and Gas Field terminus both   
 being built at Heysham. It was hoped  
 that these 2 projects would provide   
 jobs for local labour.
