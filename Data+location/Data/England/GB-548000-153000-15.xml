		<title>15 Local Houses</title>
		<content>Near the top of the town opposite      
Sevenoaks School there is a Post Office
that is 500 years old. Above the Post  
Office there is an old house which has 
very old windows, which are called lead
light windows. Then if you move down   
the High street a little bit you come  
to a house called The Chantry. This is 
  very big house. It was built around  
 the 17th century. The Chantry had so  
many windows that some of them had to  
be blocked up because of the window    
taxes. Down the High street a bit more 
we sat in St. Nicholas' Church Yard and
drew an old house opposite us. Around  
St.Nicholas' Church there are a lot of 
listed houses. Most of them don't have 
any front gardens, they just look      
straight onto the road.Then we went    
down to the Vine and looked at the     
Pavilion. Then we went back to school.
