		<title>15ANIMALS AND INSECTS</title>
		<content> We went to the Naze to look for       
 animals and insects.There were more   
 insects lurking than animals although 
 we saw a rabbit or two.We were amazed 
 to find a Wolf Spider sitting on her  
 egg sac.There were two different      
 species of butterflies,a small skipper
 butterfly and a cabbage white.There   
 were two flies,a blue bottle and a    
 hoverfly.There was lots of cuckoo spit
 on the tips of blades of grass and we 
 actually saw a young and an adult     
 froghopper.We also saw the usual      
 common insects,woodlice,beetles,ants, 
 gnats.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
