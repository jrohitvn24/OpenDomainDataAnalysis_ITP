		<content> Michael Warren, a professional{artist,
 has lived in Winthorpe since 1975.His 
 art specialises in{birds}and he finds 
 the village both conducive to his work
 and conveniently placed for access to 
 a variety of habitats.                
   Although training at art college,he 
 only became fully professional in 1972
 after an offer to mount a large       
 exhibition in London.                 
   He bases his designs on first-hand  
 observation and sketching,completing  
 the work in his study,using fine paper
 and acrylic paints.His backgrounds are
 given as much attention as the subject
 in a unique,somewhat stylised form.   
   His numerous works have included    
 designs for the R.S.P.B.,a set of     
 postage stamps and a{book}entitled    
 "Shorelines",published in 1984.Special
 commissions have taken him to America.
