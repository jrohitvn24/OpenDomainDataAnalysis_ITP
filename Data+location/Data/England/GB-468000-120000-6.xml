		<content> Only about half of the people living  
 in this area aged over 16 are economi-
 cally active.Just over 100 of them are
 retired &amp; a further 50 or so are full-
 time students.Twice as many men as    
 women are in paid employment. Although
 agriculture is the major land use it  
 only employs 10% of the workforce.This
 is because farming in this area is    
 highly mechanised.A further 10% of    
 workers are employed in manufacturing,
 mainly in the few factories in        
 Petersfield.About 20% of workers(men  
 only)are employed in the construction 
 industry.Next comes catering &amp; distri-
 bution,employing about 25% of the     
 local workforce. 'Other services' are 
 the main employer providing about 35% 
 of local jobs &amp; include manual,white  
 collar &amp; professional jobs.  Although 
 unemployment is national problem,it is
 not quite so serious in this area.    </content>
