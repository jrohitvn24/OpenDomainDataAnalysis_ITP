		<content> A group of six women have started a   
{new venture, named SKRAPS,}which they 
 hope will bring more and{new work}into
 the parish. A{home based hand-made    
{children's clothes workshop}they make 
 bodywarmers, jackets, rucksacks, also 
 cushions for crabpots used as interior
 decorative features. Products are     
 aimed at holidaymakers initially and  
 are{sold through local outlets, also  
{shops in Penzance and St. Ives.}It is 
 planned to make{adult versions}of the 
 clothes through next winter. A further
 option is to offer products to{large  
{city stores as a special line.        
{Applique methods are used}to create a 
{unique design on each product.}At the 
 moment the women each concentrate on  
 one part of the work; cutting, sewing,
 creating design, but all can swap     
 about.{SKRAPS hopes to grow}&amp; take on 
 extra help, the six retaining control.</content>
