		<content> Without public transport, the         
 telephone has become invaluable to the
 villager.  A high percentage of houes 
 here have one and there is a box in   
 the village centre which is frequently
 used.  It is a life line to the       
 emergency services which could come   
 from any one of the surrounding towns 
 at our need.  Another welcome point of
 contact for many is the postal service
 with the familiar faces of the regular
 postmen always alert to possible      
 emergencies arising to those living   
 alone.  Fornightly, a mobile library  
 service comes to the village.  The    
 Dorset Blue Van visits once a week    
 providing help and advice on all      
 social problems and information on a  
 variety of social welfare subjects.   
 Two very important lifelines.
