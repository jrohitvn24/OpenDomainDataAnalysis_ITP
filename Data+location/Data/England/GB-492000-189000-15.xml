		<title>15The Charter Fair</title>
		<content>                                       
 Traditionally a fair is held on May 10
in the Old Town.This year it was on a  
Friday when we were surveying there.   
Old Beaconsfield had changed overnight 
from a quiet,sedate town to a bright,  
busy fair. The fair takes up all the   
pavement and spills onto the road. The 
fair started coming in 1269. There is a
rule that if a fair is missed even once
it is never allowed to come back. It   
caters for all people. There are "win a
goldfish" stalls for children, fast    
rides for teenagers and darts and rifle
shooting for adults.It is very noisy   
and fun with the lights flashing on and
off, the music blaring out,a different 
song for each ride and, of course, the 
delicious smell of candy floss and     
hamburgers. There is only one real     
snag, the prices go up from 80p to 1.60
the later it gets.                     </content>
