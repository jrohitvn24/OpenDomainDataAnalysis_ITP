		<title>19GOBOWEN WOMEN'S INSTITUTE</title>
		<content> One or two visitors and prospective   
 members were included in a good       
 attendance at the April meeting of    
{Gobowen Women's Institute,}when final 
 arrangements were made for our coffee 
 evening on April 29th.                
   The handicraft competition was held 
 during the afternoon, and wasjudged   
 for us by Mrs Audrey Barrett. The     
 Hilda Evelyn Fox Memorial Cup was won 
 by Mrs J. Marvin, with Mrs N. Jones   
 becond, and Mrs F. Pickles third. Our 
 speaker and demonstrator for the      
 evening was Mr R.Sweet of Whittington,
 who gave a short talk on his hobby,   
 enamelled jewellery.  Mr Sweet then   
 invited us all to join in and make an 
 article of jewellery for ourselves.   
 There was a great response, and most  
 of us went home wearing a pendant we  
 had designed and (almost!) made       
 ourselves.{Local news sheet report    </content>
