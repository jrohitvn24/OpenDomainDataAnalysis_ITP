		<content> This area is very largely served by   
 Sedlescombe Parish Council which      
 concerns itself with the very local   
 matters including maintenance of      
 public footpaths, care of the Village 
 Green and the general appearance of   
 the village. Sedlescombe has, for     
 several years, won the Best Kept Small
 Village competion in East Sussex.     
                                       
 Rother District Council is directly   
 responsible for facilities such as    
 roads, and services such as refuse    
 disposal.                             
                                       
 Overseeing all of this is East Sussex 
 County Council which is responsible   
 for Highways, Education, Health and   
 the Police Force.
