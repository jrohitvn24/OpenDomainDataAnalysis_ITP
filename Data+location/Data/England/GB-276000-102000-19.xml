		<title>19POPULAR PASTIMES</title>
		<content>   We did a survey of our class of our 
 11 year olds to find out our favourite
 things to do after school. Watching   
 T.V. was the most popular, with       
 Eastenders &amp; 'Allo 'Allo being our    
 favourite programmes. On average we   
 watch T.V. for 3 hours a night on     
 schooldays &amp; 4\ hours at weekends     
 or holidays. 40% of our class have a  
 video. Our favourite films were the   
 "Carry on"films &amp; Superman. 36%       
 have a computer; the Spectrum was the 
 most common, followed by the Commodore
 64. Card games were the most popular  
 indoor games followed by Pac Man &amp;    
 Star Wars (arcade games).The most     
 popular outdoor activity was sport    
 (cricket, etc.) or riding our bikes.
