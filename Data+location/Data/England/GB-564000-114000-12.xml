		<title>12RURAL SHOPPING BASKET</title>
		<content> On a leisurely walk around Bodle      
 Street or Ashburnham, you can fill    
 your basket with a wide variety of    
 home grown, home made and farm produce
 - eggs, milk, cream, honey, chicken   
 and duck and occasionally lamb and    
 pork for the freezer. Villagers often 
 sell excess fruit and vegetables at   
 their gates along with jars of        
 preserves - all excellent quality. The
 village store at Ponts Green sells a  
 limited variety of goods with meat    
 bread and fish being delivered by     
 shops from the nearby villages.       
 Newspapers are delivered to some parts
 of the villages. During a good apple  
 harvest you will often see baskets of 
 apples at gateways with a notice      
 imploring you to help yourself.       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
