   If you go to Keynsham at Carnival   
 time (June) you will see a parade of  
 floats. The floats are open lorries   
 which are decorated and the people are
 dressed up. Our float was about the   
 "Yellow Submarine"(the title of a     
 song). Alisson and I were mermaids. We
 set off and waved to all the people. I
 saw my mother and my brother but they 
 were on the opposite side of the road 
 to me.                                
  Soon it was over and so we got       
 off at Cadbury's ground. There was a  
 fair with roundabouts, swings, candy- 
 floss stalls, cake stalls, places to  
 win things and a bouncy castle. I saw 
 the Wurzels sing, lots of old cars and
 parachutists jumping out of an aero-  
 plane. Then we walked home.
