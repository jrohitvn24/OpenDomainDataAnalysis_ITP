		<content> BOARD GAMES - There are many different
 types of Board-games,my favourite is  
 "Game of Life". You are given a model 
 car and have to drive it around the   
 board.At various points you earn      
 money, marry, and have children. The  
 end of the game comes when you choose 
 retirement or millionaire's mansion.  
 The winner is the person with the most
 money.                                
 PLAYGROUND GAMES - "BUDGE" is a new   
 game. Someone is on the others have to
 stand on a drain or on the steps until
 someone budges (pushes) you off.If    
 that happens you have to run to       
 anotherdrain or step before the on    
 person tags you.                      
 COMPUTER GAMES - I have a Commodore 64
 but only a few games.I like Mr. Wimpy 
 best because you have to get past     
 flying hamburgers and walking hot     
 dogs. You only have five lives.       </content>
