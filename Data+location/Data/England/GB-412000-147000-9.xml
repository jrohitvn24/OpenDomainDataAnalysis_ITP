		<content>  There are lots of different types of 
 houses in the block. The oldest houses
 are in the middle of the villages and 
 close to the churches. The oldest are 
 between 300 and 400 years old and the 
 newest house, finished in May 1985, is
 in Fittleton. It is built in an       
 orchard that once belonged to the     
 Manor House.                          
  The materials used are chalk, flint, 
 stone, brick and prefab-ricated       
 panels. Some of the older houses are  
 cruck built which gave more room      
 inside. Roof materials include thatch,
 tiles and slate.                      
  The oldest houses in Figheldean are  
 the Old Post Office and the Old Bakery
 which still has the ovens inside.     
  There are terrace, semi-detached and 
 detached houses and bungalows, very   
 small and very large. Homes are both  
 privately owned and rented.           </content>
