 Tyler Street Youth Club meets every   
 Wednesday from 7.30pm until 9.00pm.It 
 costs 15p a night and after a few     
 weeks you will be asked for a 50p     
 membership fee.You have to be 11 to   
 join and you leave at 13.There are    
 about 25 members and we do various    
 things like boating on the river,     
 camping,barbecues,discos,and many     
 other activities.Sometimes we go for  
 walks but mostly we stay in the       
 Centre.The Club itself has two pool   
 tables,a darts board,a television,and 
 an arcade game.There is a television  
 room and you can buy sweets,crisps,and
 soft drinks.The Club is run by 4      
 adults (two men and two women).       
                                       
    We think it is very enjoyable!
