There have been great changes in Berk- 
hamsted within living memory.These are 
mainly conneted with the expansion of  
the town. Senior citizens recall fields
and allotments where there are now     
homes and schools. In many instances,  
such as Barncroft, one large house has 
been replaced by twenty or more new    
houses. Co-op horses once grazed where 
Greenway School now stands.            
The enormous increase traffic has      
altered the atmosphere of the town.    
Sixty years ago, horse drawn carts and 
bicycles thronged the High Street,     
which is now crowded with cars, vans,  
trucks and tankers. Older residents    
remember playing with hoops, spinning  
tops and home made scooters on the     
roads where children and adults now    
have to cross the road with great care.
The future bypass may quieten the town.</content>
