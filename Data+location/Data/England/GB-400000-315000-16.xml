 Stonehouse Primary school opened in   
1892, but it will miss its centenary   
by seven years because it is closing   
down in July 1985.                     
 There are only 19 pupils now. The     
school once had 90 pupils. There are   
two teachers and two classes. As the   
school is very small it is much quieter
than a large school.                   
 The pupils who were interviewed  said 
that one of the advantages of such a   
small school was that they still had a 
big playground, with games lines       
painted on.                            
 House points are given for good       
work, so the pupils try to get an      
"Excellent" which is worth 2 points or 
a "Good" worth 1 point.
