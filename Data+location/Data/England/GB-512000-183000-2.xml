		<title>02THE TARGET ROUNDABOUT</title>
		<content> The{Target roundabout}has subways     
 running through it. When standing in  
 the open centre of the subway complex 
 the tunnels look like a littered      
 beehive. This litter is mainly the    
 remains of broken glass bottles which 
 crunch underfoot;ripped,bent beer cans
 and cigarette stubs,some still        
 alight.The tunnels are painted with   
 spray cans and thick felt-tips,       
 advertising local names and popular   
 mottos.On the sides of the subway     
 there are bushes with dry sharp       
 thorns. This open area is flanked by a
 one way roundabout. Over the motorway 
 there are two bridges. Next to one of 
 them is a footbridge which can fit two
 people abreast. In{1985}people are    
 worried about going into the subway   
 because of sinister happenings.In the 
 tunnels the noise is quite deafening.
