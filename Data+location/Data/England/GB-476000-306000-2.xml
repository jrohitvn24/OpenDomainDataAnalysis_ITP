    {____________________________      
  The telephone is essential for this  
 isolated community and every family   
 has its own which is operated from    
 an exchange at Somerby but is linked  
 to the national network.It is used for
 business,emergency and maintaining    
 family links.In addition there is a   
 public telephone box centrally        
 situated.                             
 There is no village post office but a 
 post box in the centre of the village 
 is emptied twice daily by a post van  
 from Oakham which makes one delivery  
 of mail in the morning.Mail is sorted 
 in Leicester and ,in the event of     
 express letters,a special delivery is 
 made.A notice board outside the       
 village hall is used to keep people   
 living in the village informed about  
 local events.                         </content>
