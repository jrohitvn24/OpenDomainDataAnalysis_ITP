		<title>02 WOKINGHAM'S LOCAL STREAM</title>
		<content> The local{stream}near our school of{  
{St.Paul's}is called the{Emmbrook.}This
 is an interesting part of our{local   
{history.}It rises to the{S.E. of      
{Wokingham}and flows into the{Loddon   
{River,}which then flows into the{     
{Thames.                               
  Once there was a{tanhouse}on the Emm 
 near Barkham Road,Wokingham which     
 tanned leather.About a mile downstream
 from the{tanhouse}was a{cornmill,     
 which was pulled down in this         
 century.Flats were built but the      
 cornmill is remembered because the    
 flats are called{"Mill Close".}       
 A long time ago farmers used to cut   
 off the branches of the willows       
 growing on its banks(called           
 pollarding)and sell them or make      
 fences from them.Now the{Water Board} 
 cut the branches in case they fall in 
 the brook and dam it,causing flooding.</content>
