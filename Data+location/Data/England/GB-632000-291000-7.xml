		<title>07St.Mary's Church/Tithe Barn</title>
		<content> In Ditchingham there is a{tithe barn} 
 that                                  
 was built about 5 to 6 hundred years  
 ago.The rector had it because long ago
 they did'nt pay him in money they paid
  a tithe of cattle,horses and corn.We 
 went upstairs and saw criss-crossed   
 thatch and beams which had Roman      
 numbers carved on them.The barn is    
 partly made of brick but is mostly of 
 timber.                               
{St.Mary's Church}-a church has stood  
 on this site since 1086.The present   
 tower,built in 1479,is about 500 years
 old.Outside the church are some       
 footstones from graves.Inside there is
 a bronze war memorial of a 1st world  
 war soldier.The spiral staircase has  
 102 stairs and a door leading to the  
 clockroom.Two of the church bells are 
 700 years old.
