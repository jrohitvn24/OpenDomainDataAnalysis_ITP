		<title>06 Villages. FRIETH &amp; SKIRMETT</title>
		<content>  FRIETH has grown during the last 150 
years from four small settlements -    
Frieth, Little Frieth, Spurgrove and   
Perrin Springs. The main part of the   
village flanks the road and village    
green. Behind the green are the Church,
School (5-12yrs) and Village Hall. To  
the north is farmland around which     
ribbon development has linked the      
original settlements. There are 198    
houses and 12 scattered on the common  
land to the east. St. John the         
Evangelist Church is a chapel of ease. 
  SKIRMETT straddles the main road. Of 
the fifty or so houses nearly half are 
modern having been infilled between    
older houses. It has a small village   
hall. The School, closed c1920, a      
chapel and Anglican Church closed      
during the last twenty years are now   
homes. Similarly the Â£Old Forge' and   
the Â£Old Bakery' are homes.            </content>
