		<title>11The Roads</title>
		<content> The roads form a good network with    
 smooth{main roads}but no pavements.   
 There are four main roads leading out 
 of Bransgore to Ringwood, Burley,     
 Highcliffe and Christchurch. On the   
 Highcliffe route you cross the A35    
 which goes to Lyndhurst. When you go  
 to Chritchurch from Bransgore you pass
 through Winkton which is a little     
 village.                              
    There are quite a few estates and  
 they have smooth well kept roads. The 
 Ringwood Road has recently had part of
 it paved near the shops.The{country   
{lanes}are narrow and uneven.Two cars  
 can only pass at laybys.The hedges    
 stick out sometimes and hit the       
 cars.The hedge cutter comes along     
 twice a year.In the winter the main   
 roads are cleared of snow but the     
 lanes are often left blocked.
