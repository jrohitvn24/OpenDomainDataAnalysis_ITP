		<title>06HISTORY OF HEBBURN</title>
		<content> Hebburn is situated on the banks of   
 the River Tyne in the Borough of South
 Tyneside.It lies to the West of South 
 Shields and to the East of Newcastle. 
 The town is a mixture of industrial   
 and residential areas.Industry is made
 up of heavy engineering and           
 shipbuilding.The residential areas are
 mainly council owned estates with     
 small pockets of private housing.     
    The first recorded history dates   
 from 797 where it is mentioned as     
 being a fishermans' hamlet.The village
 was continually raided by the Scots   
 over a long period.Coal mining has    
 been carried out over the centuries   
 and Sir Humphrey Davy tried out his   
 safety lamp here.                     
    Andrew Leslie started shipbuilding 
 here in 1853 and the population grew  
 to its present level of 24000.
