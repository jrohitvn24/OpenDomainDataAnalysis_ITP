		<title>11FARMING AT MOOR FARM</title>
		<content>   My name is Sam. I live at Moor Farm.
 The farm is rented and is one hundred 
 and thirty five acres. Ley, barley,   
 mangles, cabbages, turnips, kale and  
 rye are grown on our farm. But we are 
 mainly a dairy farm.                  
   There are fifty milking cows, twelve
 beef cows, three stock bulls and      
 twelve young bulls for beef. We also  
 have twenty calf heifers, twenty      
 yearling heifers, and twenty young    
 calf heifers under one year. The main 
 breed are red and white fresians, and 
 charollais beef cows. We employ two   
 lads on the farm, one of which is part
 time. Machines are used to help with  
 the jobs like tractors, ploughs, muck 
 spreaders, chain saws, corn drill and 
 a hay bob.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
