		<title>01Location of Whitburn</title>
		<content> Whitburn is a large village on the    
 North East coast.It lies between the  
 towns of Sunderland and South Shields.
   Sunderland,on the River Wear was    
 once a well known ship building area, 
 but is now in decline. South Shields  
 at the mouth of the River Tyne guards 
 the entrance to a still busy quay.    
                                       
      Shore and Coast Line.            
                                       
 Whitburn Village is at the northern   
 end of the natural curve of Whitburn  
 Bay.The cliffs are sandstone and      
 limestone and are rapidly eroding.At  
 the base of the cliffs lies a good    
 sandy beach and jutting out into the  
 sea are two flat,rocky outcrops known 
 locally as the White Steel and the    
 Black Steel.The tide can be dangerous 
 as it comes in a pincer movement and  
 cuts off the rocks from the mainland. </content>
