{HISTORY OF MOBBERLEY.                 
 Mobberley got its name from the Anglo-
 Saxon words 'Mot' meaning a meeting,  
 'Burgh' meaning a town or village, and
 'Lege', an open tract of country -    
 'Motburghlege'. And this was its name 
 in the original DOMESDAY BOOK.        
 The history of Mobberley is closely   
 linked with the land which was at one 
 time part of a huge forest. Mobberley 
 Brook divides the area into land      
 types - in the south the land is      
 largely sand  whereas in the north    
 clay predominates. There are also     
 large deposits of salt, peat, marl,   
 running sand and silver sand and there
 are also underground streams which    
 cause the land to be unstable.        
{LOCAL INDUSTRIES.                     
 Mostly, the area was served by small  
 Industries which served local needs.  </content>
