		<content> In the village in the 1950's there    
 were mostly shops and houses and the  
 population was about 900.Now the      
 village has been taken over by new    
 buildings and homes and the population
 is around 2000.Swan Lane had no       
 pathway there were only a few cottage 
 near the A20 end and Brook Lane       
 cottages stood alone in the country   
 side.Now there are many new homes and 
 shops which cover land that probably  
 used to be used for crops or grazing  
 land.The bus service used to be every 
 20 minutes instead of hourly like     
 today.Our school has not changed very 
 much though there used to be a school 
 house where the headmaster lived.On   
 the garage site there was a forge a   
 printing press and a sweet shop.Silver
 Spray was a garden nursery.
