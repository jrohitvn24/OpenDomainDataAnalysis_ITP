		<title>10The Village Shop</title>
		<content>During the summer of this year Sulgrave
Stores has changed hands and is now    
owned by a local family who also own   
the garage in the village.The shop     
provides a vital service as it is the  
only shop in the area.Old people       
appreciate being able to buy vegetables
bread and groceries without travelling 
7 miles to the nearest town.           
Many of the goods sold have to be      
collected by the owner from a large    
Cash and Carry warehouse in Northampton
but fresh goods are delivered regularly
by wholesalers.Bread is brought from a 
nearby village bakery and is sometimes 
still warm when it arrives.Various     
shapes of loaves are sold,bloomer,batch
tin and cottage.A large loaf costs 51p.
Other deliveries include fruit,sweets, 
vegetables,dairy produce and biscuits. 
A petrol pump in the yard sells petrol 
for just over $2 per gallon.           </content>
