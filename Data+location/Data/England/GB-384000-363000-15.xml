		<content>   Often in the summer boys like to    
 play{cricket,}and girls play{rounders.
 In the winter boys play{football}and  
 girls play{netball.}Other games we    
 play at playtime are{bulldog,fifty up,
{walley}and{stoky.}In the game{bulldog 
 you have to run from one base to the  
 base opposite without being touched by
 the person who is on and if he did    
 touch you, you are on. In the game    
{walley}a number of people throw a ball
 against the wall in turn.{Stoky}and   
{fifty up}are similair for in both     
 someone counts while the rest hide.   
 When the other person has finished    
 counting he goes to look for the      
 others. In fifty up, if he sees one of
 the people who is hiding he has to    
 race him to the post. If the person   
 who was hiding gets to the post before
 the other person, he will not be on.
