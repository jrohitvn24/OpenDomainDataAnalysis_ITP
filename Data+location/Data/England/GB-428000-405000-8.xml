		<content> DODWORTH COLLIERY:Employs 95 men.Is   
 the outlet for the combined Dodworth  
 and Redbrook Pits.The men descend at  
 Redbrook and the coal is moved        
 underground and brought to the surface
 at Dodworth.The coal is washed and    
 sorted,loaded into railway trucks and 
 sent for industrial use by rail.      
    The surface workings cover an area 
 of half a square mile,the largest part
 of which is occupied by the grassed   
 over spoil-heap which dominates the   
 village.                              
 RAILWAY:Carries mainly goods          
 traffic,notably coal from the local   
 pits.Coal trains carry about 900 tons 
 of coal for the power                 
 stations.Recently the line has been   
 reopened to passenger traffic carrying
 people from Huddersfield to Sheffield 
 via Penistone and Barnsley.
