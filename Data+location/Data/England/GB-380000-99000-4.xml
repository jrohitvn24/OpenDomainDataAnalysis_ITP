		<content> A compact village on the main A354    
 road from Dorchester to Blandford     
 Forum. A static village with very     
 little housing development. What      
 little private building has been      
 allowed by the County Council, despite
 pleas by the Parish Council, is priced
 so that young married people cannot   
 afford to purchase resulting in an    
 aging population and fewer children.  
 All children living in the few County 
 Council houses have now passed through
 the School and with the local farms   
 employing fewer workers the prospects 
 for the School are bleak.             
 There are no organised activities in  
 the village for young people who have 
 to travel to nearby towns for such    
 events. The School playing field is   
 made available for youths and children
 at all times.                         
                                       </content>
