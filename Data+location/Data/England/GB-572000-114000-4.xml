		<content>   WE COUNTED TRAFFIC AT ALL THE       
 ENTRIES AND EXITS TO BATTLE FOR 15    
 MINUTES IN THE MORNING. WE DISCOVERED 
 THAT THE MAIN ROADS WERE BUSIER THAN  
 THE SIDE ROADS. 200 VEHICLES PASSED   
 THROUGH BATTLE TOWN CENTRE EVERY 15   
 MINUTES. MOST OF THESE WERE CARS, BUT 
 VANS AND LORRIES WERE COMMON          
 TOO.COACHES AND BUSES BRING TOURISTS  
 TO THE TOWN, BUT MOST VEHICLES CARRIED
 PEOPLE COMING TO WORK OR GOING        
 SHOPPING. MORE VEHICLES LEFT THE TOWN 
 THAN ENTERED IT IN THE COUNT          
 TIME, BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE FINISHING   
 THEIR SHOPPING AND GOING HOME FOR     
 LUNCH. WE CALCULATED THAT 4000        
 VEHICLES GO THROUGH BATTLE IN EACH    
 DIRECTION EVERY WORKING DAY,WE THOUGHT
 THAT BATTLE NEEDED MORE CAR           
 PARKS.THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH ZEBRA      
 CROSSINGS. THE ONLY CROSSING IS       
 OUTSIDE THE POST OFFICE.              </content>
