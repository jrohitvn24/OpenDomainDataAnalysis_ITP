		<content>There is one child welfair clinic in   
Wotten Rd, next door to Cofton school. 
There are no doctors,dentists,opticians
chiropdists in our area, but all these 
sces are within one mile of Cofton     
school. One pupil, aged ten years, has 
a hole in his heart, but takes place in
sports ativities. Seventeen pupils have
respirtory problems and use inhalers in
ol. One parent uses a wheelchair a     
result of a road accident many yaers   
ago. Here is how one young girl keeps  
fit....."I always try to stay healthy. 
I aways have an apple a day. There's a 
saying Â£An apple a day keeps the       
dentist away'. I brush my teeth three  
times a day. I always run five times   
around the garden. Then i do five sit  
ups, ten jumping jacks and five press  
ups. That should keep me heathy.
