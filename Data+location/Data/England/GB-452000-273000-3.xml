		<title>03The Clinic</title>
		<content> For our Domesday project we decided to
 do about the Hillmorton Clinic.It has 
 been open for about fifteen years.When
 it was first opened it was run by the 
 Warwickshire County Council.In 1974   
 the clinic was taken over by the local
 Health Authority.Mrs Morgan is the    
 person we interviewed and she showed  
 us around.She is a Health Visitor and 
 enjoys her job very much.Most of her  
 patients are under five years of age. 
 When people need a doctor they ring   
 the clinic.They also have groups for  
 mothers and babies,and there is a pram
 shelter outside in case of a wet day. 
 You can also visit the dentist here.
