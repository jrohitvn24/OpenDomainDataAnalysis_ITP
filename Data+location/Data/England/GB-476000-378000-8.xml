		<title>08TRESWELL WOOD</title>
		<content> Treswell Wood is an ancient woodland. 
 It was first mentioned in the Domesday
 Book. In Norman times it was used for 
 grazing the swine and collecting      
 firewood. Today the trees are being   
 coppiced and the wood generally       
 improved. It belongs to a Nature      
 Trust. There is a nature trail there  
 and we followed it as part of our     
 school's survey work. We saw Damsel   
 Flies and heard the warble of a Cuckoo
 over our heads. On either side of the 
 path, Bluebells, Red Campions and     
 Purple Orchids mingled their colours. 
 Oak, Ash Hazel and Elm trees border   
 the path. The Service tree is a rare  
 local specimen. There have been lots  
 of nest boxes provided and many types 
 of birds can be seen. Cut wood is sold
 towards the upkeep of the property.
