		<title>01Healey Broomley S of Tyne</title>
		<content> Land drops from 200m in S to Tyne     
 valley. In travelling S to N on A68,  
 great sense of space with vista from  
 New Riding Hill bypass of Tyne Valley 
 and hills beyond. Plantations of      
 conifers and isolated farmsteads with 
 mixed crops and pasture lie between   
 the two hamlets of Broomley and       
 Healey. Local sandstone used in       
 practically all buildings. Broomley   
 composed almost entirely of small farm
 steadings, Healey of a church and     
 stone cottages connected to the Healey
 estate which is based on mixed farming
 and forestry. A small saw mill        
 utilises                              
 some of the timber for estate         
 purposes, fencing gates, the remainder
 sold to timber merchants. Red         
 squirrels, badgers, wood ants, foxes, 
 woodland and moorland birds.
