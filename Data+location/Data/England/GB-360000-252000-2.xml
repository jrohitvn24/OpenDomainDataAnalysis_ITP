 ruins of an early Norman church,one   
 hundred and twenty years ago.         
    The current vicar is the

{Major Mercer-Wilson and Mr. T. Davies.
 Regular services are held on Sundays, 
 together with services for religious  
 events.                               
 Marriages,baptisms,confirmations and  
 funerals are also conducted.          
    Presently the average congregation,
 on a sunday, is around fifteen.This   
 being usually much larger however     
 during special religious festivals.   
    The bells in the tower ring loudly 
 to tell people that a service,or a    
 function, is on its way.The           
 churchyard is now closed and people   
 are being buried in a cemetery,a half 
 kilometre away.
