		<title>13DEWSBURY'S POPULATION CHANGE</title>
		<content> At Eastborough school 15 years ago 5% 
 of the children were of Asian origin. 
 Now there are 67%,and the younger     
 classes have considerably more, one   
 class being 100% Asian. Attracted by  
 employment in the textile industry,the
 families tended to occupy large       
 terrace housing, and areas like Savile
 Town and Crackenedge are predominantly
 populated by Asians. Whilst 20% of    
 Asian children were born in Pakistan  
 most can speak English,even though at 
 home they revert to their native      
 tongue of Punjabi or Urdu in          
 conversation with parents.Most are    
 devout and regular attenders of the   
 mosque,many children going 5 times a  
 week,though older girls and mothers   
 tend to pray at home.Few Asian        
 families go on annual holiday, but    
 they ofen visit relatives far away    
 and many have visited their homeland. </content>
