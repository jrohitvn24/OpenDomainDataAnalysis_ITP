		<title>09A Welbeck Miner's Thoughts</title>
		<content> When Tom Moody started in 1943,       
 training was very haphazard.Tom merely
 watched the miner he was assigned to  
 for a couple of days before doing the 
 job himself.Nowadays apprenticeship   
 schemes have led to better educated   
 workers and the local apprentices     
 attend Lound Hall,near Bevercotes     
 Colliery for several weeks before even
 seeing the coalface.Tom was working on
 the coal face after 3 days!           
  Wages have obviously changed.In 1943 
 Tom earned 24/3d (Â£1.21) per week.Now 
 a new face-worker earns Â£150 per week 
 plus bonus.Mr Moody feels however,    
 that there was far more discipline and
 pride amongst the miners in 1943 than 
 there is today,but that discipline is 
 gradually returning.                  
  At Welbeck today the coalface is the 
 safest place in the pit.Tom would not 
 like to go back to 1943 conditions.   </content>
