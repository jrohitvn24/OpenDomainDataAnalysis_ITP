		<title>15THORPE ARCH TRADING ESTATE</title>
		<content>       Originally Thorpe Arch Trading  
 Estate was the site of a munitions    
 factory in the second World War.  Now 
 it is a sprawling estate, covering    
 about two kilometres, of wharehouse   
 and factory buildings, all laid out in
 neat rows separated by small straight 
 roads.                                
                                       
       Most of the buildings are used  
 as wharehouses rather than big        
 producing factories employing many    
 workers.                              
                                       
      Altogether in our area of the    
 Trading Estate there are 146 business 
 premises. The majority of businesses  
 have manufacturing workshops and      
 offices.  Most of the factories are   
 small having less than 50 workers and 
 one or two manufactures only have a   
 hand full of employees.               </content>
