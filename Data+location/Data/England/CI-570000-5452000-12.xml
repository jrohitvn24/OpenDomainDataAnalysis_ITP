		<title>12LES ECREHOUS</title>
		<content>    Les Ecrehous are a reef of rocks,  
 situated off the north-eastern corner 
 of Jersey, and administered by the    
 Parish of St. Martin. There are       
 several huts which belong to local    
 fishermen, and are used by them       
 frequently, though none is permanently
 occupied. During the 19th century     
{Philippe Pinel}lived there on his own 
 for many years, and was nicknamed the 
{'King of the Ecrehous'.               
    They are the site of one of the    
 oldest 'lighthouses' in the British   
 Isles, for in 1203 a small priory was 
 built there with a fund to 'burn a    
 candle in the window each night', and 
 this was done for more than three     
 centuries.                            
    In 1953, after a dispute about     
 sovereignty between Britain and       
 France, the International Court of    
 Justice decided in favour of Britain. </content>
