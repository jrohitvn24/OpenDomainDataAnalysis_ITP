		<content> Amongst young people fashions in      
 clothes,hairstyles &amp; make-up are      
 strongly influenced by pop culture.   
 TV,pop videos &amp; numerous magazines    
 provide easy access to the latest     
 trends.Although some ideas are widely 
 copied,many are only adopted by       
 specific fans of a particualar group. 
 The success of such pop groups as     
 Culture Club has led to some boys     
 wearing jewellery &amp; make-up when they 
 go out.Short hair with no sideburns   
 has also been a recent trend.Some boys
 &amp; girls have sought to express        
 themselves through hair colouring,eg. 
 from bleaching to bright colours.TV &amp; 
 magazines have also helped to make    
 many adults more fashion conscious.   
 Styles in suits, shoes,skirts and     
 dresses are constantly changing,under 
 the influence of London fashion       
 designers.                            </content>
