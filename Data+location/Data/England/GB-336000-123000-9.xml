		<title>09Curry Rivel Brownie Pack</title>
		<content> I like Brownies because you play games
 and go out and explore. I am 8 at the 
 moment. I was 7 when I started. I am  
 in one of the sixes called the Imps. I
 have passed 2 Brownie badges already. 
 I have got my Hostess and Cooks       
 badges. For the Hostess badge you     
 have to welcome and look after a guest
 or guests at your own home or at a    
 party, prepare at least some of the   
 refreshments yourself and make a      
 flower arrangement. For the Cooks     
 badge you had to make tea and toast,  
 boil an egg, cook bacon or sausages,  
 cook some potatoes and one other      
 vegetable and make scones or small    
 cakes.                                
 A Brownie Pack is divided into small  
 groups called 'Sixes'. They each have 
 the name of a type of Brownie. Here   
 are some of the names; Elves, Pixies, 
 Gnomes, Sprites,and Scottish Kelpies. </content>
