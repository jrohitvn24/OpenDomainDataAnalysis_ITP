		<content>   FROM THE RESULTS OF OUR SURVEY IT   
 APPEARS THAT THE CHILDREN OF GATLEY   
 PRIMARY SCHOOL AND THEIR PARENTS ENJOY
 THEIR SPARE TIME.A NUMBER OF UNUSUAL  
 LEISURE TIME ACTIVITIES SUCH AS       
 BEEKEEPING,ARCHAEOLOGY AND WARGAMING  
 OCCUPIED SOME PEOPLE.                 
   SPORT AND OTHER OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES  
 WERE BY FAR THE MOST POPULAR WAY OF   
 SPENDING LEISURE TIME FOR FAMILIES AND
 FOR DADS.MUMS,HOWEVER,PREFERRED       
 HANDICRAFTS AND READING AS THEIR MAIN 
 INTERESTS. THOUGH NO DADS RECORDED    
 SWIMMING AS THEIR MAIN LEISURE        
 ACTIVITY IT WAS THE SINGLE MOST       
 POPULAR FAMILY ACTIVITY.              
    TRAVEL AND OUTINGS WITH THE FAMILY 
 REMAIN POPULAR WHILE ONE DAD REPLIED  
 THAT EATING WAS HIS MAIN PLEASURE!
