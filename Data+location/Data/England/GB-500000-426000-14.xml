		<title>14HUMBERFIELD QUARRY, HESSLE</title>
		<content> Situated below the Civic Amenity Site 
 in north-west Hessle, compacted waste 
 is brought here from the two Civic    
 Amenity Sites run by Humberside County
 Council. The waste, in this prototype 
 disposal scheme, is stacked in the    
 quarry and flattened by a 28 ton      
 roller. After compaction, foundry     
 waste from the nearby Capper Pass     
 chemical factory is laid over the top.
 To keep flies and bacteria away a     
 Landrover sprays the waste with a     
 chemical. In addition to household    
 rubbish, building, chemical and       
 industrial waste are also brought here
 to be dumped. The council charges     
 rates from Â£2 per load for a 30 cwt   
 pick-up truck to Â£35 for a 4-axle     
 compaction vehicle. It is estimated   
 that the quarry will be totally       
 infilled in about another fifteen     
 years.                                </content>
