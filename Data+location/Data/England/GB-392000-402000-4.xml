   Our school is called Broadfield     
 Primary School.It was built two years 
 ago.It is a single storey building,   
 except for one section.there are 4    
 junior classrooms, a large tiled craft
 room, a resourses room with a         
 television and three infant classes.  
   We have seperate nursery classrooms,
 mainly tiled for messy work and a     
 carpeted withdrawal area.The nursery  
 has its own outdoor playground        
 including a covered area so that they 
 can play out in the rain.The grounds  
 include an all-weather pitch and a    
 rounders court.                       
    Gardens surrounding the school have
 been made by the Groundwork Trust,who 
 gave us lots of trees and plants.     
    There are 265 pupils and 9 teachers
 at the moment.
