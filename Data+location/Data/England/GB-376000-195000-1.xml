		<content> The area around Dursley is bordered on
 three sides by the Cotswold Hills with
 its landscapes of green fields and    
 wooded slopes and on the other by the 
 Severn Vale with the river itself     
 meandering from the Bristol Channel   
 inland to Gloucester and beyond. Many 
 areas of National Trust property are a
 testimony to the outstanding scenic   
 beauty of this part of                
 Gloucestershire.                      
    Cattle and arable farming cover    
 most of this part of the county but   
 farming certainly is not the largest  
 form of employment.  Small industries 
 provide some employment within the    
 area but the majority travel to their 
 place of work at Bristol, Gloucester, 
 Stroud and Berkeley and Oldbury Power 
 Stations.
