		<content>{The Almshouses}are to be found behind 
 St.Mary Magdalene Church.The main     
 building was built in 1368 by John De 
 Cobham.The foundation was disolved in 
 1539-40.It was uninhabited until 1596.
 In 1956 the almshouses were           
 refurbished,but there were only       
 sixteen flats then.Each flat has one  
 bedroom,one sitting room,one bathroom 
 and central heating.The almhouses are 
 run by a trust called Rochester Trust 
 Fund.Pensioners apply to live there.In
 1981 they were completely restored.The
 almshouses have more than sixteen     
 flats nowadays.
