		<title>02Living in Collingham</title>
		<content> Four children aged eleven wrote about 
 life in Collingham as they saw it.{   
{Andrew Owens}after having lived in    
 Hong Kong for two years was amazed to 
 see that green fields had turned into 
 new housing estates.It is good that   
 Collingham is in the country and not  
 near any factories.There is always    
 something to do like climbing         
 trees,jumping dykes,building rope     
 swings and enjoying the countryside.{ 
{David Hanson}likes to play football   
 and go train spotting at Collingham's 
 railway station.{Sarah Clipsham}likes 
 the sport and leisure which Collingham
 provides.Her favourite game is        
 tennis.{Matthew Bancroft}says that    
 Collingham is not too noisy.He also   
 likes the sport but it would be a fine
 improvement if a sports centre was    
 built.The children all go to the      
 primary school in the village.        </content>
