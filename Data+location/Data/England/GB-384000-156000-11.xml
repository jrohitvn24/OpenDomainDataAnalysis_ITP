		<content> The firm gets its name from the two   
 men who started the business in 1956  
 ,Mr.Perrett who provided the capital  
 and Mr.Cox who had the engineering    
 skill. The firm now employs fifteen   
 men although at one time more than    
 forty worked there. The main work     
 carried out at the moment is the      
 casting of aluminium teapot spouts.   
 Perox were at one time the biggest    
 single producer of teapot spouts in   
 the country but are now second to a   
 company in Birmingham.Casting is      
 usually done once every week and as   
 many as spouts are produced in each   
 casting session.The company also      
 produces braces which are used to     
 reinforce large buildings.These are   
 made out of the finest quality        
 stainles steel and are specially      
 designed for different buildings.
