		<content>    Most Flushing working boats are    
 typically Cornish,within the size of  
 about 20-30 Ft.Long working boats in  
 Flushing were used for oyster dredging
 and with a shallow keel could get up  
 river in rather shallow conditions    
 working boats nowadays are used mostly
 for racing,and pleasure. They are     
 usually "home-made" but when used to  
 be working boats they were built up   
 the river in places like Gweek,Feock  
 and Mylor:                            
    Here are some boats that race today
 and there builders.
