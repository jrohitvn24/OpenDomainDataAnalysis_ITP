		<title>05        CHINA CLAY.</title>
		<content>   China clay is the most important    
 mineral mined in S.W.England.Open     
 cast mines at St.Austel,Cornwall,     
 and Lee Moor,Devon are the main       
 producers and are owned by English    
 Cina Clays.                           
   China clay is mined at Lee Moor     
 using high pressure water hoses and   
 after a series of refining processes  
 it is piped to the Marsh Mills drying 
 plant.The slurry is piped into cloth  
 filters and squashed in a press and   
 all the water gets sqeezed out.Then   
 the China Clay is separated from the  
 cloth.Then it gets put on a conveyor  
 belt and taken to some large kilns    
 where it is completely dried.Then it  
 is stored as a powder or put into     
 bags.                                 
   Some goes by lorry and then by ship 
 to other countries.Some goes by train 
 to factories.                         </content>
