		<title>19MAGPIES AND JAYS</title>
		<content> When I first moved into the area I had
 rarely seen a magpie and I had never  
 seen a jay.One of the local pubs-'The 
 3 Jays'gave me a clue to the treats I 
 had in store in the ornithological    
 sense.The now ubiquitous magpie with  
 its superstitious reputation is the   
 most successful bird species in the   
 area and although it is a scavenger   
 and an opportunist its marvellous     
 black,white and blue plumage gives    
 delight to those who see it.          
 The jay,although common is much less  
 readily seen and it appears to be a   
 very shy bird even though it has      
 little reason to be.Its classic multi 
 -coloured plumage is a lovely sight in
 the early morning though a pair of    
 arguing jays might keep one awake at  
 night with their raucous cries.There  
 are also a multitude of other species 
 to delight the bird-fancier.          </content>
