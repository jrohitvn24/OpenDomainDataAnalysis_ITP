		<title>04...LOCAL HISTORY</title>
		<content>Most of the area was farmland and was  
sparsely populated. Shard End was once 
part of the Manor of Castle Bromwich   
while Firs Hall once stood on the Firs 
Housing Estate.  After the 1939-45 War 
Shard End Estate was built following   
compulsory purchase orders being made. 
All that remains of its past are a few 
cottages in Packington Ave. and School 
Lane. Some road names remind us of its 
farm history, like Brookmeadow and     
Hernefield. Likewise Arkle Croft and   
Sandown Road remind us of Bromford     
Estate's racing past. A race course    
existed from 1895-1965. Castle Bromwich
Hall built about 1600,is owned by Bovis
who bought it from the Bradford family,
the manor's previous owners. The Parish
Church was built in 1726-31. Documents 
show a chapel existed in 1175 in Castle
Bromwich. The last piece of open land  
here is Hodge Hill Common.             </content>
