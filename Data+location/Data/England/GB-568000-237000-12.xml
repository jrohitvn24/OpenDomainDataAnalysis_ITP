		<content>  Children under school age can attend 
 a playgroup in Toppesfield. A few go  
 to a private nursery school in        
 Halstead. About 4 school-age children 
 attend private schools in Barnardiston
 and Stoke-by-Clare.                   
  Pupils remain at Hedingham until age 
 16 at least. Some young people from   
 Stambourne attend courses at Braintree
 College of Further Education.         
  Adults can attend day and evening    
 classes at Hedingham, Halstead and    
 Haverhill. Sports activities are      
 especially popular, but crafts,       
 languages and other skills are also   
 available.
