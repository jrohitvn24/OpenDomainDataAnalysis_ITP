		<content> Mr. Dimbleby is a television broad_   
 caster. He broadcasts on a variety of 
 subjects, mostly current affairs.  He 
 has visited 50 different countries,   
 enjoys his work but is concerned that 
 his family worry about him while he is
 away. He was born in Aylesbury, Bucks 
 in l944 and his father was Richard    
 Dimbleby, a famous broadcaster.       
 Jonathan Dimbleby lived in London     
 before moving to Swainswick.  They    
 moved here to be near his wife's      
 family.He stays home in his spare time
 and doesn't watch a lot of T.V. He    
 plays tennis.                         
 He is very keen on history.  He feels 
 that the proposed bypass will spoil a 
 beautiful part of the country and will
 increase the number of lorries and    
 therefore the noise.  He uses the A.46
 four or five times a day.
