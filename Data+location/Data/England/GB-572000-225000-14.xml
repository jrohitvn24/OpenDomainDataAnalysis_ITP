		<title>14The Courtauld Factory</title>
		<content>     {Bocking}was larger and more      
 important than{Braintree}in the       
 medieval woollen industry. Following  
 the decline of wool, silk weaving was 
 introduced. For 160 years the textile 
 factory, started by{Samuel Courtauld, 
 provided employment for many people   
 from{Bocking}and the surrounding area.
 The invention of artificial fibres led
 to expansion to international size and
 the giant organisation closed the     
 Bocking site in 1981. Most of the     
 derelict buildings, dating from around
 1920, have been{vandalised}and are at 
 present, an eyesore. Some of the      
 smaller buildings are being used by   
 small industrial concerns (page       
 15). The building, fronting Bovingdon 
 Road, is to be converted into flats.  
 The largest building is to be pulled  
 down and 118 houses and 113 flats     
 built in its place.                   </content>
