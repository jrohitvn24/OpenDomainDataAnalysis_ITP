		<title>01BISLEY AREA</title>
		<content> The area is one of outstanding        
 natural beauty and mainly farmland.   
 This is nearly all arable and the     
 woods are beech. The centre of the    
 area is dominated by the upper end of 
 the Toadsmoor Valley.  It contains two
 villages,Bisley and Eastcombe, and    
 several hamlets:Bournes Green, Nashend
 Stancombe, Battlescombe, Througham,   
 Lypiatt and Scrubbs. The area is      
 served by the Bisley with Lypiatt     
 Parish Council, the Stroud District   
 Council, in the county of Gloucester- 
 shire. The majority of the inhabitants
 work and do their major shopping      
 outside the area in the nearby towns  
 and cities of Stroud, Gloucester and  
 Cheltenham. There is a very limited   
 bus service and most households have  
 at least one car.  The highest land   
 point is over 800 feet above sealevel.
 The rockbed is limestone.             </content>
