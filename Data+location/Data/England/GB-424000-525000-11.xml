		<title>11ST JOSEPH'S R.C. CHAPEL.</title>
		<content>    St Joseph's R.C. Primary School's  
 new chapel cost Â£100000. The altar is 
 made of granite and weighs four tons! 
 Our priest is called Fr. Kennedy. Our 
 chapel has got stained glass windows. 
 The Baptismal Font is made of granite 
 and so is the lectern. Bishop         
 Swindlehurst officially opened our    
 chapel. He poured oils over the altar 
 to bless it. The roof of the chapel   
 comes to a big point with a cross made
 of metal on the top. The roof has a   
 giant sky light. Hanging from the roof
 is a big metal ring of light bulbs.   
 Behind the altar is a wooden cross    
 which was hand carved and cost Â£100. A
 giant shutter separates the chapel    
 from the school hall and blue velvet  
 curtains hang in front of it. The     
 shutter lifts up when we have mass.   
 There's a tabernacle inside the chapel
 a cry room, changing room and office. </content>
