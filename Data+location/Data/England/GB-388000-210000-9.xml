		<title>09CLIMPERWELL FARM</title>
		<content> Climperwell Farm is one of the largest
 in the parish, although not all of the
 land actually lies within the parish  
 boundary. In total there are some     
 500acres, of which some 300 acres is  
 arable,producing mostly barley, wheat,
 oil-seed rape and in recent years peas
 as a protein crop.                    
    The rough grassland is used for    
 store cattle,and ponies while the     
 remaining 140 acres is woodland       
 producing some fencing materials and  
 in the last two seasons a pheasant    
 shoot has been started on a syndicated
 basis, with some 2000 birds being     
 bought in for release.                
    The owner is Kieth Broadstock and  
 he and one full-time worker run the   
 farm with the help of casual workers  
 during the busy times of harvest and  
 planting.                             
                                       </content>
