		<content> Thirteen businesses were identified in
 the block. Of these, two were garden  
 nurseries, two manufactured goods and 
 the rest were service industries.     
  The thirteen businesses employ a     
 total of 52 people of whom 7 are part-
 time. This total includes the self-   
 employed owners.                      
  Five of the businesses have grown up 
 on small pockets of land left by the  
 construction of the railway and       
 remaining derelict until recently.    
  The businesses have started in this  
 area either because of long-standing  
 family ties or because of low over-   
 heads and the pleasant rural locality.
  The coal merchants deliver door to   
 door in the immediate locality while  
 the agricultural transport firm       
 travels as far afield as Poland.
