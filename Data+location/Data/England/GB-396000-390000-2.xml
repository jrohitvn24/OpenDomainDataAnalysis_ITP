 Residential Methodist Youth Centre.   
                                       
 This residential centre in square four
 of our block was opened in September  
 1968 by Mr. Paul Bartlett Lang in the 
 building which used to be the Primary 
 School in the village of Chisworth.   
 The school had been closed for        
 some years.                           
 It was converted with a grant from the
 Joseph Rank Trust. The Youth Centre   
 sleeps 26 and takes any age of        
 children. They cater for themselves   
 in a large kitchen with several       
 cookers. The children come from       
 many parts of the North for a country 
 holiday and for hiking etc. They sleep
 in dormitories and there is a large   
 lounge for the evenings.
