		<title>04BRADWELL PARISH COUNCIL</title>
		<content>   The Bradwell parish council consists
 of fifteen members. The present       
 chairman, who has served for thirty   
 three years, told us about the work of
 the council.                          
   Members are elected every four      
 years. They hold meetings on the      
 second Tuesday of each month excluding
 August. The meetings commence at      
 8 p.m. and last two hours. The public 
 are welcome to these meetings, held at
 the old Bradwell school, now the      
 Community Centre.                     
   There are five minutes at the end of
 the meeting for the public to put     
 forward their views about anything    
 they disagree with, for example, the  
 position of the bus shelters.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
