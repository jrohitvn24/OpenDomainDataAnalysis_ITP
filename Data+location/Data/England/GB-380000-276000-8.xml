		<content>{1735-1985: 250 years of carpet manu-  
{facturing.}The first carpet loom was  
 erected in the town in 1735 and by    
 1800 Kidderminster had the largest    
 concentration of carpet manufacture in
 the world. From a simple home industry
 the carpet trade expanded with the    
 Industrial Revolution: factories were 
 built, power looms were introduced.   
 During the present century electricity
 has taken the place of steam power,   
 and since 1945 the most important     
 innovations have been the introduction
 of tufted carpets and the widespread  
 use of man-made fibres. The intro-    
 duction of modern processes has given 
 rise to competition at home and abroad
 in recent years, but by concentrating 
 on high-quality traditional carpets,  
 Kidderminster remains the{world centre
 for{woven}carpets.
