		<title>10PUBLIC HOUSES</title>
		<content>      There is only one public house   
  in this area, the Stags Head at      
 Burwell on the A16.  It is an old     
 coaching house and still has 6 stables
 at the back.                          
      Beside the pub is an old         
 "buttercross" where products were sold
 on market day.                        
      It is a busy little pub with a   
 lot of regular customers most of whom 
 travel from outside the  "local" area.
 It is especially busy in the summer   
 when visitors to the east coast pass  
 through.                              
      In the pub there are stockcar    
 medals won by one of the landlords    
 friends at Skegness Stadium.  The     
 landlord sponsors him.                
      The pub is decorated with various
 antiques including old cart wheels and
 of course a stag's head.
