		<title>01WELTON AND DUNHOLME.</title>
		<content> This block mainly consists of good    
 farming land (average cost Â£2000 acre)
 The villages of Welton (Pop 2599) and 
 Dunholme (Pop 1562) are also included.
 They are both growing villages (approx
 5 miles from Lincoln). Estate agents  
 have no difficulty in selling houses  
 that come on the market (3 bed semi   
 average cost Â£24000) Both villages are
 popular places to live, especially    
 for middle class families with        
 young children. Both communities have 
 energetic and supportive inhabitants  
 therefore there are many different    
 activities within each village.       
 Welton is the larger village with more
 facilities.                           
 Both villages contain a Church. St.   
 Mary's in Welton was rebuilt in       
 1823.St. Chad's Dunholme has an Early 
 English Tower.
