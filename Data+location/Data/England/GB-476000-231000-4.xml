		<title>04Great Horwood Silver Band</title>
		<content>  There are roughly 35 people of both  
sexes in the band. The age range is    
between nine and seventy-four years of 
age. The music they play ranges from   
pop to classics. They have a uniform   
which is black trousers or skirt, a red
jacket with gold trimmings and a maroon
tie with GHB on it. Every Wednesday    
evening between 7.45 p.m. and 9.30 p.m.
they meet in the village hall for      
practice. The instruments range from   
cornets, flugel horns and euphoniums to
basses,trombones and drums.            
 The band was started in 1888 and it   
performs concerts and engagements      
within a fifteen mile radius of the    
village, although the furthest it has  
travelled is to Folkestone. A junior   
band was started 12 years ago and was  
restarted 2 years ago and has just     
played its first concert.
