		<content> I live in the Broadway in Kinson.There
 is a social club behind my house.At   
 night I can hear the music.The club   
 has a very large field attached to    
 it.In the field they play rugby,      
 cricket and football.A football team  
 hire the field.                       
    In the summer they hold dog races  
 for people who want to race their dogs
 against other dogs.Some people hire   
 the club for parties.                 
    You are only allowed to go into    
 their field if you have permission.   
 There is an old stadium where people  
 used to sit and watch football.Now it 
 is dangerous as it is falling down.   
    Lots of people go there because it 
 is close to where they live.          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
