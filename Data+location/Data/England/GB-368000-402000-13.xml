 about 18 houses per month.   Terraced 
 houses, the most popular amongst first
 time buyers cost about Â£18,000, semi  
 detached about Â£28,000, detached      
 Â£35,000 and a flat about Â£16,000.  If 
 you are between 18 and 80 you         
 can qualify for a loan to buy the     
 house, called a{mortgage.}You need a  
 10% deposit then you pay back the loan
 over 25 years with interest. Sometimes
 interest rates go so high people can  
 not afford their mortgage and the     
 house is taken off them.{             
{   Houses increase in price}due to    
 a)increase in demand, b)inflation     
 and c)increased building cost.{Houses 
{decrease in price}through neglect and 
 plentiful supply in undesirable areas.
 More houses are sold in summer months 
 because of spring weddings and good   
 weather.                              </content>
