 The compilers of this document have   
been children from the local Primary   
School.Bad weather prevented us from   
making too many outings in a formal    
setting but much information has been  
also gleaned from older relatives.     
  The school consists of some 70       
children aged 5-9 years of age,some of 
whom have their roots firmly fixed in  
the village and others whose families  
have moved to the village and fully    
adopted it but whose parents largely   
work in Bury St Edmunds,Mildenhall or  
even further afield.
