		<title>18Living In A Lighthouse</title>
		<content>                                       
 A family recently moved into {North   
{Low Lighthouse.}They told us about {  
{living}in a lighthouse.They moved into
 the area to get away from {noise}.They
 liked watching the {river}and the {   
{boats }on it from the top of the      
 lighthouse.There was also a good {    
{view.}Although the area is {isolated} 
 they still get a lot of {visitors}.   
 They  have contact with the {         
{smallholding }and buy {dairy products}
 such as {duck eggs}etc. One thing they
 dislike is the {refinery smell.}The   
 interviewees {disagree}on whether  the
 area is different to where they used  
 to live. They go to the {"New Inn"}for
 a drink and a meal.They both work     
 locally,although outside our area.One 
 of the problems is the{bumpy road}to  
 the lighthouse,but they hope to{      
{improve}it in the near future.        </content>
