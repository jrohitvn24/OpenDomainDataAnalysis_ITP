		<title>13**Sheep keeping*************</title>
		<content>I live on a farm and we keep sheep.They
are called ewes and gimmers and        
hoggets.They always get them in in the 
winter and when they start to lamb,    
Dad hasto give them some nuts and      
water and hay. Sometimes we help to    
hay and water and Dad carries bags of  
food. He went into hospital and now he 
is out but we have more trouble. The   
owner is retiring and the new man is   
selling our farm. Everyday Dad goes out
shepherding. He always takes the dogs  
out. Their names are Nell, and George  
and Joe. Joe does not do what Dad says.
Dad puts ear tags in.Ear tags are      
coloured red, turquoise, orange and    
yellow. He puts them on with some      
silver ear tag cutters; they always    
bleed and all blood drips down from    
their ears. Dad always does it .He does
some sheering. He sheers six hundred   
and fifteen sheep. Mum spins the wool  </content>
