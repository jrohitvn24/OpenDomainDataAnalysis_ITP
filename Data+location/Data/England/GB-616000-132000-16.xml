		<content> dirting the same.' The White Hart     
 hotel is one of the oldest buildings  
 in Hythe with timber dating back from 
 the 15th century. One room in the     
 hotel was a robing room for the Mayor 
 and it's supposed to connect with the 
 Council Chamber. Montgomery and the   
 American Ambassador stayed there in   
 the 2nd World War to get information  
 on flying bomb attacks. Corn and      
 cattle markets were held under the    
 Town Hall and in Market Hill.According
 to the Kentish Gazette someone who was
 employed to dig the Royal Military    
 Canal brought his wife to market, tied
 her to a post and sold her for six    
 pence. Up Market Hill is Manor House. 
 The Deedes family used to live there  
 until they moved to Sandling Park in  
 1800. Manor House looks like a        
 Georgian house but dates back to the  
 17th century.                         </content>
