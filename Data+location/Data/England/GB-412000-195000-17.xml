 a{community minibus}service in the {  
{Fairford}area, based at{Kempsford}to  
 be started in 1984. Three circular    
 trips operate on Tuesdays picking up  
 around nine villages for shopping in {
{Fairford.}On each Thursday there is a 
 trip from different groups of villages
 to{Carterton}market. The County,      
 District and Parish councils helped   
 the initial funding of the 16         
 passenger, second hand bus from       
 Stroud. The service is run entirely by
 volunteers. The fares are: adult- 20p.
 school children - 10p. The fare to    
 Carterton is 50p.{"The Flying Fox"}   
 with its bright yellow and green      
 paintwork attracts attention but is   
 not yet self supporting. It is        
 available for hire at other times,    
 making trips to{Bristol,Weston Super  
{Mare, London}and the{Oval Test Match. </content>
