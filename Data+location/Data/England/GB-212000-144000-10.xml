		<content>{The Radio Telephone.}There is no wire 
 link between Lundy and the mainland   
 -and use of the phone is not          
 ordinarily avaliable to visitors.The  
 only phones are in the office and in  
 two houses(for emergencies).The       
 standing charge is at present around  
 Â£1000 per annum.                      
{The Postal Service.}Mail is carried on
 the Polar Bear to Biddiford P.O. and  
 a charge is made for this service on  
 outgoing mail.Stamps have been issued 
 since 1929.Mail used to carry British 
 and Lundy stamps but in 1974 a        
 franking machine was aquired and now  
 the full cost is covered by Lundy     
 stamps which are affixed on the left, 
 leaving room for franking on the      
 right. Some philatelists specialise in
 collecting Lundy stamps but nowadays  
 not many commemoratives are issued.   
 The income only helps to defray costs.</content>
