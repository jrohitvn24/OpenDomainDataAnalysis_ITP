		<title>19TILMANSTONE PIT _ SURFACE</title>
		<content>  {Tilmanstone Pit}has been a part of  
 Kent{landscape}and{economy}since 1913.
   The{pit_head}lies at a cross_roads; 
 with the eastern arm bearing{pit traf_
{fic}to the A256. The scene is fairly  
 typical of a working mine.{Winding    
{Gear}stands against the skyline, with 
{spoil heaps}to the north_west of the  
 Pit.{Reservoirs}lie to the north. The 
 water is sent underground to Deal.    
   The Pit has a{screening}and{cleaning
 plant to grade the coal, most of which
 is used by the{steel industry.}The{Pit
{site}houses a canteen, baths, lamp_   
 room, medical centre, offices, garage 
 for an ambulance.                     
   The end of the{mining dispute}in    
 1985 saw a good number of voluntary   
{redundancies.}The future of the Col_  
 liery remained uncertain until July   
 when the{proposed closure}in 1986 was 
 announced.                            </content>
