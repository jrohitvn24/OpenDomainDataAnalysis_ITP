{William}and{Richard}who bought out    
 local glass factories and established 
 the{Pilkingtons Glass Company.

 leading glass manufacturers.{Lady     
{Mavis}now lives at Windle Hall which  
 has a dining room, 2 sitting rooms, a 
 hall, a sunlounge and ten bedrooms.   
 Lady Mavis is president of the
