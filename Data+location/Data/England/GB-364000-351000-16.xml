		<content>    The Nantwich churches all play     
 their individualistic role in the     
 town's religious life.Geographically  
{St.Mary's Parish Church,}commands a   
 central position.This beautiful       
 Anglican building is full of          
 historical interest.The Rector leads a
 dedicated team.Besides the varied     
 services there is a Sunday school, a  
 superb choir, Guiding and Scouting,   
 and many adult groups.The Parochial   
 Church Council provides overall       
 direction especially in maintaining   
 the building for posterity,but worship
 pastoral care and alms-giving are the 
 Church's life blood.                  
   In 1974 the Congregational and      
 Baptist congregations joined for      
 united services of worship and formed 
 the{United Reformed Church.}The 300   
 year old Baptist Church is having its 
 present site in Market St. developed. </content>
