		<content>One of the exciting industrial develop-
ments in Thame is the new 15 million   
pound plant recently built for BOC. It 
has all the latest technological       
advancements and replaces the 80 year  
old plant. The company separates liquid
oxygen and nitrogen from the air and   
sells it to over 400 customers in the  
south-east. Oxygen becomes a liquid at 
-182 deg C and is used for burning.    
Nitrogen is liquid at -187 deg C and is
used for freezing. In a day 28 tons of 
oxygen and 100 tons of nitrogen can be 
produced. 100 litres of oxygen costs 30
pounds and the equivalent nitrogen     
costs 4 pounds. 50 people are employed 
at the plant, half of them being       
drivers. The old plant is being        
demolished and will be used as a       
transport depot. We saw a demonstration
of steel cutting using the oxygen-     
acetylene cutter. (see photograph)     </content>
