		<title>08GISLEHAM BRICKS AND PIPES</title>
		<content>In the south west corner of our area is
situated a brick and pipe works. The   
manufacture of {bricks} and clay pipes 
was carried on at this site until      
about 1981. At the centre of the site  
is a large pit from which the raw      
clay was extracted, first by manual    
labour, later by means of pneumatic    
shovels and, latterly, by means of     
mechanical diggers.  Moulds were used  
to shape the clay into bricks. Some    
years ago the works ceased to make     
bricks as these could be purchased     
more cheaply from the London Brick     
Company and production was switched to 
making pipes for land drainage.  This, 
in turn, ceased about 4 years ago when 
plastic pipes became cheaper.  The     
buildings and kilns remain, together   
with some of the tools.  The engines   
are still sometimes started and        
drive the machinery by means of air.   </content>
