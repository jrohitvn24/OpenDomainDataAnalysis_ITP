		<content> The Old Schoolis by the church, when  
 the number of children diminished it  
 was no longer economic to keep it     
 open. Negotiations are in progress for
 it to be bought by the parish to be   
 converted into a village hall, with   
 the addition of a new kitchen and     
 toilets. This would provide a much    
 needed venue for social functions. In 
 November 1985, for instance, it has   
 been found necessary to hold the      
 Christmas Bazaar in the back of the   
 Church, though some people disapprove.
 Money is raised for the Church repairs
 and expenses and various good causes  
 by means of a Summer Fete and         
 Christmas Bazaar, coffee mornings and 
 jumble sales. A sponsored cycle ride  
 this summer attracted 9 riders who    
 raised a total of Â£334 for the Norfolk
 Churches Trust, half of which went to 
 St. Mary's Church.                    </content>
