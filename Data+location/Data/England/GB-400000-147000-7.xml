		<content> On Friday our publican Mr Burwell came
 to visit us. He was once a sailor in  
 the Royal Navy. He was a sailor for   
 nine years and started when he was 18 
 years old. He trained on a{stone      
{frigate} called H.M.S. Raleigh. The   
 first country he went to was          
 Singapore where it was so hot that he 
 wore sandels and shorts and nothing   
 else. He went to Singapore called     
 VC.10. His new ship was called H.M.S. 
 Triumph. If anything went wrong with  
 other ships H.M.S. Triumph put it     
 right. He showed us some photos and   
 some of his uniform. In those days    
 sailors trousers had creases in them, 
 so they could fold them up easily. In 
 those days sailors drank rum. Once a  
 princess came to visit his ship.      
 Sometimes if they did not do as they  
 were told, when they came into port   
 they had to stay on the ship.         </content>
