		<content> The estate Residents Association have 
 for some time been concerned about the
 view of the estate held by the town   
 population.  They have felt that the  
 name Boycott Farm has not helped.     
 Local representations were made       
 following a poll of the residents to  
 have the name of the estate changed.  
 The town council agreed after         
 protracted efforts and this was       
 finally ratified by the Wychavon      
 Council.  The name chosen was         
 Westlands Estate.  It took much       
 further effort to have road signs etc 
 changed and there was considerable    
 disagreement about the funding of the 
 new signs.  A solution was found      
 involving the Town Council, the       
 District Council and the County       
 Council.
