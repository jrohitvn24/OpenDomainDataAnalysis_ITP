		<title>11TRANSPORT IN PETROCKSTOWE</title>
		<content> Most people in{Petrockstowe}can drive:
 they learn young, first on a tractor, 
 and graduate up via motorbike to car. 
 89% of households own at least 1 car  
 or van, 31% own 2. Nearly half also   
 own a motorbike and/or bicycle. It is 
 virtually essential to own a vehicle, 
 as there is{little public transport:  
 the railway line to Petrockstowe      
 closed 1982 and bus services are very 
 limited, suitable for shopping in     
 Bideford or Barnstaple, but inadequate
 for getting to and from work.         
    Mothers drive their children to    
 Playgroup, or School at Merton. Men   
 drive to work, on a nearby farm,the   
 clayworks, or office in local towns.  
 There are only 4 retail premises: one 
 is a 2-pump petrol station. To visit  
 London you can travel by train or     
 coach from Exeter, but you have to    
 drive 40 miles to Exeter to start !   </content>
