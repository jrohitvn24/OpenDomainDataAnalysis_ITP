		<content> Until 1981 the whole estuary was      
 tidal.At the head of the estuary known
 as Millbrook Lake,boats could only use
 this 3 hours either side of high      
 tide.The lake area was dammed up in   
 1981 to stop the village flooding at  
 very high tides.About 20% of the South
 foreshore is owned by Mrs.Gay,10% is  
 owned by Lord Elliot and the rest by  
 the Duchy of Cornwall.People have     
 moored their boats for many years in  
 Millbrook Lake paying the Duchy only  
 small amounts.                        
{THE ESTUARY}is owned 90% by the Duchy 
 10% by the Earl of Mt.Edgecombe up to 
 Palmer point.Mr. P Patterson who lives
 at Foss Quay leases the foreshore from
 the Duchy so people who moor boats    
 near his yard pay fees to him.He      
 designs catarmarans.In 1985 the parish
 Council will take control of moorings 
 above and below the dam.              </content>
