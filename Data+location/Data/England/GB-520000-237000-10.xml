		<title>10Memories  of   Stotfold</title>
		<content>                                       
          Mrs Brown is 91 years old and
 has lived in Stotfold all her life.   
   Over the years she has noticed many 
 changes.When she was a child she says 
 "Everyone knew everyone else"Her old  
 landlord drove around in a little     
 horse and cart.He was the owner of the
 brickworks that was situated near the 
 cemetery.This was destroyed when the  
 A1 was built.                         
   She says there was very little      
 industy in the area,"there was only   
 the asylum and the farms".Her uncle   
 collected and sold straw on Hitchin   
 market to the hatmakers of Luton.The  
 straw was sorted by women in Stotfold 
 and taken to market on Tuesday.       
   The rads in the village have        
 improved greatly,and so to has the    
 street lighting."We used to call      
 Church Rd.Dark Lane"she recalls.      </content>
