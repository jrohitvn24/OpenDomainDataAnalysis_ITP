		<content>   The farm has existed since the{17th 
 century.Since{1945 Valley Farm}has    
 been owned by the second{Baron        
{Hollenden}and his wife{Anne.          
   The family house has been added to  
 in recent years by the architect{Louis
{Osman.}The house has a spectacular    
 fireplace, a green oak staircase and  
 peacocks in the garden.               
   Mixed farming is carried out on a   
 small scale,the main concern now,being
 forestry.There are 85{Exmoor-horn     
 sheep,1{Guernsey cow and bullock;}the 
 sheep give Grade{A}wool.              
   The farm covers{100}acres,half of   
 which is given to animals and the rest
 to forestry.It has its own water      
 supply from a line of{pure}springs.It 
 is worked by only{two} men.           
   Rabbits,deer,squirrels and pigeons  
 are a nuisance.
