		<title>18Cricket in Leverton</title>
		<content> Leverton Cricket Club was formed some 
 seven years ago by several interested 
 village cricketers who used to play   
 for other village teams.They decided  
 that it was time the village had its  
 own team.A local farmer was approached
 and permission obtained to create a   
 cricket field in the middle of what is
 known locally as the park.Since then  
 the cricket club has continued to play
 friendly fixtures both home and away  
 against other local village teams.The 
 players enjoy their cricket even when 
 they lose.The ground itself is a      
 typical village cricket ground and is 
 a beautiful place in which to play.   
 The outfield contains a large walnut  
 tree and if hit by a batsman during   
 the course of his innings scores five 
 runs.In the history of all matches    
 played at home it has been hit only   
 three times in seven years.           </content>
