		<content> In the fields in our area there is a  
 lot of wildlife. There are foxes,     
 rabbits, the hare, badgers, squirrels,
 deer and moles. There are many        
 different types of bird, including    
 owls.                                 
    There are plenty of trees and      
 hedges in which animals and birds can 
 make their homes. There is the River  
 Stour for fishing and kingfishers and 
 herons can be seen. In the mornings   
 you might hear a cuckoo or the sound  
 of a cockerel from one of the local   
 farms.                                
    Nearly every year there is hunting,
 when people on horseback bring hounds 
 through Milton looking for foxes.     
    The area is almost pollution free  
 and local people are conservation     
 minded. It is a good area for studying
 natural history.
