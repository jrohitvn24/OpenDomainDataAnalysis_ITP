		<title>13  Country park</title>
		<content>Following work on a Riverside Plan in  
1983 an area in the south east of the  
block was approved by Gillingham       
Borough Council as a "country park"in  
1985. The park will extend along the   
river shore north of the coastal or    
Lower Rainham road. The park is        
intended to be a blend of continuing   
agricultural and recreational use.     
Among the planned activities are horse 
riding, fishing and rambling. There is 
an information centre near the park    
and the whole area is monitored by a   
full-time ranger.At present (July      
1985) while some of the facilities are 
in place and in use,the park still     
awaits its formal opening.
