		<title>16The Snake Road</title>
		<content>      The{Snake Road (A57)}goes from{  
{Glossop}to{Sheffield.}It was built in{
{1821,}one of the last turnpike roads  
 in Britain. The original charges were{
{two and a half pence}for horses and   
 carriages. Clergy, postmen and        
 soldiers went free.                   
      The highest point is{1,680 feet} 
 above sea level, and in winter the    
 road is sometimes closed by           
 snowdrifts. There are special road    
 open/closed signs along the road from 
 Manchester.                           
      The road crosses wild and fine   
 scenary. The name reflects the winding
 nature of the road but could also come
 from the{snake}on the{Cavendish}coat  
 of arms once found on the{Snake Inn.} 
      In{summer}there is a special bus 
 service over this route on{Sundays.}  
 It is mainly used by tourists and     
 walkers.                              </content>
