		<title>04Farming near Bisbrooke</title>
		<content>    A crop survey revealed the         
 following information about the       
 agriculture east of Bisbrooke and     
 north of Seaton:                      
                                       
    The most common crop is wheat with 
 only a scatteed amount of Barley.     
 There was little oil seed rape or     
 potatoes growing there. All the fields
 had hedges growing round them, but no 
 fences or walls were in evidence. The 
 farmers grow several fields of grass  
 which are cut for hay. There are only 
 two fields which cattle use for rough 
 grazing. The number of cattle in      
 fields is about 30, being a mixture of
 bullocks and cows. Near a gateway     
 there is a massive manure heap. In one
 farm building there is a store of hay 
 and straw bales. Arable fields are    
 about 200x400m2, pastures 100x600m2.
