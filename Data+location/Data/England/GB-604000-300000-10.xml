		<title>10WICKLEWOOD  WALK PART 1</title>
		<content> I begin at High Oak. From here I can  
 see most of Wicklewood. There is a    
 garage, a few houses and a water      
 pumping station.Descending I pass a   
 pond,a farm and cottages. This is the 
 Green. Along Hackford Road I come to  
 the Cherry Tree public house. Turning 
 left into High Street I go downhill   
 passing the Village Hall,village shop 
 and our famous windmill. Further down 
 is a disused Primative Methodist      
 chapel and an old cottage that used to
 be the post office.Modern houses and  
 bungalows line this road.Near the     
 bottom of High Street is a            
 cross-roads.To the right is Low       
 Street with some old people's homes.  
  On one corner is an old house that   
 once was the Kimberley Arms public    
 house, for the Kimberley estate owned 
 much of Wicklewood.
