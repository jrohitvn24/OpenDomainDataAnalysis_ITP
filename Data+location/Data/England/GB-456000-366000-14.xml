		<content> The most popular games are running,   
 skipping and ball games.Examples are: 
{                                      
{Run Across}_One middle person catches 
 players who run across.Those caught   
 help that person to catch others.     
{Elastic}_With elastic stretched around
 their ankles forming 2 parallel lines,
 2 players stand 2m.apart. A 3rd.child 
 jumps outside the elastic,inside,onto,
 inside again and then jumps clear. If 
 the elastic is caught at the wrong    
 time that child is out.The elastic is 
 gradually raised higher and higher to 
 the thighs until there is a winner.   
{Catch}_A ball is thrown to a child.If 
 the player drops the ball a handicap  
 is imposed.Successive handicaps are   
 given with each failure so that the   
 player goes down on one knee,then two,
 one elbow,then two and so on until he 
 is lying on the floor and eliminated. </content>
