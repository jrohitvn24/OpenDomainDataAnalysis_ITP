 The{children}of Pytchley{School}      
 celebrate May Day annually on the     
 Saturday nearest to the first of May. 
 At 2.30 p.m., the children start to   
 process around the playground.  The   
 Garland Bearer leads the procession   
 followed by the six Hoop Bearers.     
 Behind them, the children who have no 
 special job to do carry a garden cane 
 which they have decorated themselves. 
 These are followed by the two Sword   
 Bearers who lead the two Attendants,  
 and the May Queen follows last of all.
                                       
 After the opening speech has been made
 the May Queen is crowned and the small
 children from the Infant School do an 
 easy dance.                           
                                       </content>
