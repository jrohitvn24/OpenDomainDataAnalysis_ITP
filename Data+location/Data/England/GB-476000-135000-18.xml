   The day started at 8.30  a.m. and we
 went to the tutor and had our mark put
 in the register. After tutor we went  
 to Block 2 for T.D. with Mr.Cross.    
 Next was Games and we played baseball.
 The teacher was Mr. Withers. At break 
 everyone goes to the main hall where  
 the canteen is. The next period was   
 Maths.In Maths we have Mr Alexander.  
 We are working on a new scheme with   
 some small Schools Maths Project      
 books. At dinner time everyone gets   
 locked out of school because of the   
 strike action.When we get back to     
 school we have to get our marks in the
 school register again. After that we  
 have library where you read and after 
 that we have music with Mrs Mercier.  
 After that the bell goes for          
 home-time.
