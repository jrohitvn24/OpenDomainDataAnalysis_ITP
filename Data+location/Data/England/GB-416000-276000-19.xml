		<title>19Farms in Knowle</title>
		<content>      At Henwood Hall farm Mr Joyce the
 son of the farmer gave us alot of help
 and infomation. There is 90 acres of  
 Wheat, Swede and Turnips. They have   
 been taking up old turf and selling it
 because they are going to re-seed it. 
 There is 30 acres of sheep grazing,   
 they sell sheep for slaughtering. When
 the motorway  was built the farm lost 
 15 acres  of land, where cattle were  
 kept and also lost a farm cottage.    
      The family have lived on the farm
 for 19 years and Mr Joyce told us some
 of the history of the sight.          
      The farm-house was built in 1840 
 but before that it had been a nunnery 
 and a priory. The moat was a fish pond
 that burst its banks and now the river
 flows past.                           
      Once they had two sheep stolen   
 they found wool on the top of the     
 style but never found the sheep.      </content>
