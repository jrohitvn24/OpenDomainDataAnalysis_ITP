		<content> On 9th May 1985 I went on a visit to  
 the local fire station. We discovered 
 that the station has 10 part time     
 firemen although there should be 15.  
 There is a station officer, a sub     
 officer, a leading fireman and the    
 rest are ordinary firemen. They have  
 one fire engine which is a diesel     
 automatic. On the engine they carry   
 hoses,cutting equipment,walkie-talkie 
 radios,a feather weight pump,salvage  
 sheets and a dosimitor which measures 
 radiation. Last year they had 307     
 calls one of which was to rescue a    
 heron which was trapped in a tree.They
 get some false alarms caused mainly by
 children. The firemen are on call 14  
 hours a day,7 days a week.We were told
 that they do not have many calls on   
 bonfire night because nowadays people 
 go to organised bonfires.
