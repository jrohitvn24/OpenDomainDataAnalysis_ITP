		<title>08The Vicar</title>
		<content> The Vicar has been in Exminster for 7 
 years. He is in charge of 2 churches, 
 one in Kenn and one in Exminster. On a
 Sunday he unlocks the church at 7.30am
 and the day is spent taking services. 
 During the week he visits hospitals   
 and people in their homes. He goes to 
 the school to talk to the children and
 has weddings and chistenings to       
 organize.                             
                                       
 The helpers in the church are two     
 church wardens, an organist, a        
 treasurer, 20 church councillors, bell
 ringers, some sidesmen and a grave    
 digger.                               
                                       
 The Vicar needed special training to  
 do his job. He went to University and 
 then to theological college where he  
 learnt how to become a priest.
