  The area has now only a small element
 of true countrymen living in it. These
 people are very concerned with the    
 upkeep and the conservation of the    
 countryside around. The rest of the   
 people living here are fairly rich    
 commuters who use the area as a       
 dormitory town. These people like the 
 country but do not take part in       
 conserving it.                        
    We asked a Publican what he thought
 of the new buildings in construction  
 in the area. He replied saying that he
 did not mind them. It will bring more 
 people to his pub.                    
    Farmers hate this development. The 
 area is changing to an{urban}         
 community. The majority of people are 
 more concerned with money and holidays
 rather than upkeep though one village 
 has entered a Keep Tidy competition.  </content>
