		<title>08Trethosa Methodist Chapel</title>
		<content> The chapel which was built in 1876 is 
 well-maintained and still active.There
 was a lively centenary celebration in 
 1976 although Methodist activities are
 recorded in an earlier building       
 erected at the beginning of the 19th  
 century at Trethosa Farm. A poem by   
{Jack Clemo - "Bethel Centenary"} was  
 written to mark the occasion and      
 printed in the celebratory booklet.   
 The section beneath the chapel was the
 original Trethosa School from 1891    
 until the current building was erected
 in 1900. The{Sunday School,}initiated 
 in the ealier farm building, has been 
 held in the section below the chapel  
 since its construction. The area has a
 strong Methodist tradition and on a   
 number of occasions (e.g.May1895) the 
 school was closed to allow a{Rechabite
{demonstration}to take place.
