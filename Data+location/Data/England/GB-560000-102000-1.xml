		<content>   Hampden Park and Langney are both a 
 part of Eastbourne,which is situated  
 by the coast.Hampden Park and Langney 
 consist mostly of housing estates.I   
 live in Hampden Park,at the moment    
 there is some building going on not   
 far from my house,the building is     
 going to be a cold store for Anglo    
 Dutch Meats.There is a big industrial 
 estate near me which has many types of
 factories on it,we also have a lot of 
 rough grazing land which used to be   
 marshland but has been drained,but    
 hopefully the council are going to    
 turn it into a big park.There are a   
 number of shops in Hampden Park,and a 
 shopping centre at Langney.In Hampden 
 Park we have a big Queensway furniture
 store, and a railway station and a    
 park and I think that Hampden Park is 
 a friendly community to live in.
