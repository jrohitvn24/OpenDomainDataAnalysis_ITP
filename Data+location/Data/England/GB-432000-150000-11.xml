		<title>11OIL EXPLORATION-HATHERDEN</title>
		<content> In May 1985 a seismic survey team     
 were working in the village. They send
 vibrations into the ground using four 
 huge trucks with large vibrating      
 pads.The vibrations last about 20     
 seconds and are taken every 10 metres 
 along the survey line.The sound waves 
 sent into the ground are reflected at 
 the boundaries between rock layers and
 the reflected waves are measured      
 by sensitive microphones , called     
 geophones, laid along the survey      
 route.From the geophones they pass    
 along a cable to a recording truck    
 where they are recorded on a magnetic 
 tape.The tapes are then sent off to be
 interpreted before any test drilling  
 is done. The early signs were that the
 survey team felt that the results     
 seemed to show that oil was present in
 this area but they did not know in    
 what quantity.                        </content>
