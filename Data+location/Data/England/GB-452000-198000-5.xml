		<title>05Radley Opinion Survey</title>
		<content>Most people asked have moved into      
Radley from somewhere else. The        
majority of people have lived in       
Radley for under 5 years. Most people  
work outside the village. Not many     
people travel less than 5 miles to     
work. Many people think that Radley    
has changed in their time here, with   
new housing and the noise and roads,   
but the opinion was mixed as to the    
value of these changes. Most people    
think Radley is a friendly village,    
with enough leisure and child-centred  
amenities, and enough shops. Most of   
our survey were certain that Radley    
should not be made bigger with either  
housing or shops. A minority regretted 
the absence of a Youth Club, and felt  
that the Parish or the local Council   
should provide more holiday facilities 
for the young. About a third of our    
sample wanted more variety of shops.   </content>
