		<title>10WHITE CLEVES QUARRY</title>
		<content> As we approached the quarry we were   
 almost sprayed by an old converted    
 fire-engine.The fire engine's job is  
 to keep the dust down, to please the  
 local inhabitants of that  area.The{  
{quarry}was opened in{1922}by the Devon
 County Council.It is now owned by a   
 private company called the{ARC. }     
 Before the Devon County Council bought
 it,it was called West Mill Farm.The   
 rock they blast out from the{quarry}  
 face is{basalt granite}.The rocks are 
 made into{chippings}and dust.This is  
 done in stages:when the rock has been 
 blasted it is taken to the primary    
 crusher here it is crushed into       
 fragments six inches across.Then it is
 passed into the secondary crusher     
 where the rock is broken up into      
 pieces about three inches across.Then 
 finally the rock goes into the{       
{Hydrocone}where other sizes are made. </content>
