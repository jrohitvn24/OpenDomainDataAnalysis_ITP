		<title>18The School Cleaner</title>
		<content>   When I married 24 years ago I left  
Great Horwood and came to live at 16   
Winslow Road.I moved to 12 as it is a  
bigger house.I used to work in Winslow 
Hospital which I got to in my husband's
car,then I worked at the Co-op shop in 
Swanbourne,then at the Manor House when
it was an old people's home,then 13    
years ago I came to this school.My     
hours used to be 18,now they are 10.   
   The Co-op shop is now privately     
owned and it has a sub post office     
which used to be in the cottage next   
door.There used to be a bakery but it  
is now an antiques shop and tearoom.   
   We used to be able to get into      
Winslow by bus 3 or 4 times a day and  
on certain days to Leighton Buzzard.Now
there is a daily bus at 8a.m. to       
Bletchley and it returns at 6p.m.We    
can't go to the doctor in Winslow with-
out hiring a taxi.                     </content>
