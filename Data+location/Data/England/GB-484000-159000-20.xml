		<content> About one third of our area is        
 occupied by the RMA and Staff College,
 and so contains nothing to count      
 (according to the guard commander). We
 couldn't get in ourselves.            
                                       
 Because there is so much new housing  
 there are no accurate maps and we     
 scrounged from every site office and  
 estate agent we found. In the Eastern 
 section most of the houses are huge,  
 even the new ones. As we moved        
 Westward the houses became smaller but
 nearly all detached. It looks as      
 though we don't have many churches or 
 schools but there are hordes of them  
 100 metres over the border of the     
 surrounding blocks.
