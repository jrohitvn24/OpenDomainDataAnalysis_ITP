		<content> My day begins early.  Usually about   
 seven o'clock.  I get up and watch the
 news, then I go downstairs.  I have my
 breakfast at about quarter to eight.  
 Then I get ready to go to school.  We 
 set off at about quarter past eight.  
 We arrive at half past.  First thing  
 in the day we have assembly, then we  
 have three lessons which last forty   
 minutes then it is break.  We all go  
 outside for fifteen minutes.  Most    
 people play on the swings and slides  
 but I prefer playing other things,    
 like Hide and Seek or just on my own. 
 Then when the bell goes we have to go 
 in.  We have another two lessons then 
 it is lunch.  We have a set menu.     
 After lunch I go out and play.  Then  
 it is lessons until it is time to go  
 home.  I put on the computer and play 
 a game.  My sister likes television.  
 After tea I go to bed.                </content>
