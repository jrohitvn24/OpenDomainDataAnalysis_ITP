		<title>12Watford: Legend</title>
		<content> In Watford, about 100 years ago,a     
 woman                                 
 who did not believe in God said,"If   
 God exists, when I die a fig tree will
 grow out of my heart". She died about 
 thirty years later and was buried in  
{St.Mary's Church Watford.}As the years
 passed people noticed that a shoot    
 had begun to grow out of the side of  
 the grave,and in about five years a   
 fig tree had formed and was growing   
 against the church wall.  It was      
 soon fenced off, a plaque was put     
 up telling the story, and many        
 people came to see it.                
                                       
 Now the plaque has gone and the fig   
 tree chopped down but even now one    
 side of the grave is very slightly    
 open.                                 
                                       
                                       </content>
