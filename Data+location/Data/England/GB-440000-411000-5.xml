		<title>05Terry's Chocolate Factory</title>
		<content> Terry's came to Hemsworth as a packing
 station in 1964,and was extended in   
 1968. The chocolates are sent from    
 York to be packed in Hemsworth. There 
 are one hundred and seventy-eight full
 time jobs but extra personel are      
 employed seasonally.                  
 The factory buillding was formerly    
 used as a roller rink and a dance     
 hall.                                 
 In one year, 5,000 tonnes of          
 chocolate bars and about 3,000 tonnes 
 of chocolate are packed in Hemsworth. 
 The Council were very pleased that    
 Terry's chose to come here as         
 unemployment is very high in this     
 area.
