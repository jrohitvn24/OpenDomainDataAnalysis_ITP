		<title>19FAMILY LIFE IN CHELTENHAM</title>
		<content> Usually my family starts by getting up
 around 8 o'clock.They get dressed,have
 a wash and go down to breakfast which 
 is usually bacon &amp; egg or cereal like 
 cornflakes.Then you clean your teeth. 
 Now dad goes off to work and the      
 children brush their hair and get     
 ready for school.While they are at    
 school mum dusts and hoovers the rooms
 or some mums go to work, in fact most 
 mums do round where we live.Some      
 children go home for dinner but most  
 take sandwiches to school.Around half 
 past three the children get home from 
 school and they go and watch telly or 
 play a game outside.When Dad comes    
 home at 5 o'clock we get our tea over 
 with and watch a bit of telly till 9  
 o'clock.Then us children go to bed and
 dad and mum have a peaceful evening.At
 11.30 mum and dad go to bed and this  
 is the usual pattern of our week.     </content>
