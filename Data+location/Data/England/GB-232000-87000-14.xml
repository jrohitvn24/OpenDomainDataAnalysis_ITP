		<title>14THE RIVER TAMAR.</title>
		<content> Apart from about three miles the river
 forms the geographical border between 
 Devon and Cornwall.Its source is      
 located North of Bude and its estuary 
 is at Plymouth. As far as we are      
 concerned, the river runs through     
 beautiful farmland,much of the river  
 bank being tree-lined.                
 The river is a great focal point for  
 fishermen as it abounds with trout and
 salmon. It drains the area and is a   
 source of water for the many cattle   
 that graze alongside its banks. The   
 occasional otter has been spotted from
 time to time.                         
 Often the river floods, in the winter,
 bringing silt into the fields         
 therefore making them very fertile and
 giving excellent grazing for cattle.  
 The river hams are rarely ploughed.
