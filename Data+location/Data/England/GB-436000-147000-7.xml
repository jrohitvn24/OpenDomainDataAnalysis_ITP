		<title>07THE PHEASANTRY AT HACKWOOD</title>
		<content> Hackwood Copse is near Trinley Farm.  
 There are 4/5 pheasantries in the     
 Copse. The raising of the pheasants   
 gives {EMPLOYMENT} to Ron Holdway and 
 Paul Jenkins.They look after and rear 
 the pheasants. Pheasantry {FARMING}is 
 very popular in this area because     
 people are invited to the farm for {  
{RECREATION}shooting. Only the males   
 (cocks)are shot. The hens are not shot
  Mr.Holdway rears 5,000 pheasants a   
  year. First the eggs are put in an   
 incubator.When they hatch they are put
 into the special pens. When they are  
 bigger they have rings put through    
 their beaks to stop them eating each  
 other. While they are in pens they are
 fed a special food. Then they go into 
 the open pens in the woods so if they 
 want to fly off they can. This happens
 every year. Some of the pheasants are 
 born in the wild.                     </content>
