		<title>19 CUT BACKS IN POST OFFICE.</title>
		<content>                                       
About 20 years ago at the Post Office  
Headquarters it was decided to close   
1,000 Post offices by 1987. Two years  
ago the sub post offices at Windmill   
Ave and London Rd. were told they might
have to close down. People sent        
petitions to Headquarters and wrote to 
the newspapers protesting against the  
closure. They liked their local Post   
Office and didnt want to travel further
for things like stamps, family         
allowances and old age pensions.       
Because of the locals' pressure it was 
decided to keep Windmill Ave. P.O.     
open.It is a small but busy Post       
Office,employing 2 people and dealing  
with 250 F.A. and 250 O.A.P weekly.    
The protest are still going on against 
the London Rd closure. It gives out 750
O.A.P.and 250 F.A. weekly and employs  
3 people.                              </content>
