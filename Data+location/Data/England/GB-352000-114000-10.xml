		<content> In 1980 the church celebrated it's    
 600th birthday.Many local businesses  
 gave tapestry pew cushions,some woven 
 by local people,the designs showing   
 who gave them.e.g.a helicopter stands 
 for Westlands.The wool used  came from
 the Wilton Carpet Co,because it is    
 hardwearing,mothproof and the colours 
 won't fade.                           
            About 140 people go to the 
 Sunday services and the number is     
 increasing.There are around 23        
 organisations connected with the      
 church like the Sunday School,        
 Brownies,Crusaders,Youth Fellowship,  
 Mothers Union &amp; so on.                
            A recent appeal to restore 
 the church raised Â£100,000,but they   
 need more to repair the roof.The near-
 by school rooms were renovated this   
 year and turned into a Hairdressers,a 
 cakeshop and a giftshop.              </content>
