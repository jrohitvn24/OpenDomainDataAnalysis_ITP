 The library is in the Community Centre
 which is in the middle of the large   
 shopping complex.  There could be more
 children members and the adult members
 are mostly elderly.  The books that   
 are most popular are  fiction.        
 The popular authors were:  for the    
 ladies it was Catherine Cookson, for  
 the men Wilbur Smith and for the      
 children, boys and girls, Enid Blyton 
 and Roald Dahl.  We were also told    
 that quite a lot of people forget to  
 bring their books back and that a     
 letter is sent.  The children have    
 to pay 15p to cover the postage of the
 letter and adults 7p per day until    
 they bring them back.  The busiest day
 is Tuesday because Monday and Sunday  
 it is not open.  It is busier in the  
 Winter than in the Summer.  There are 
 7 staff, 5 of them work part-time.    </content>
