		<content>       In the fields at{Lawn Farm}there
 were sheep and cows. When we walked   
 into the farm drive we saw a fresh    
 stream running down the side of it.   
 They had sheared the sheep and filled 
 the bags with wool. They have 110     
 acres of grass and have been living   
 there for 3 years. They make silage   
 and put it in a tower in the farmyard.
 A fan blows the grass through the     
 pipes and into the shed where all the 
 calves are .They have 3 sacks of corn 
 and minerals a day.There were 85 lambs
 left and the others had been sold for 
 meat. The parlour at Lawn Farm is not 
 used. The farmer owns the farm next   
 door and they milk the cows there.
