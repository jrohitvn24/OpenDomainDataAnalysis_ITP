		<title>07Farming in North Hastings.</title>
		<content> Above Hastings the high ridge looks   
 north across the Rother valley and the
 Weald.It is still heavily wooded      
 largely with deciduous trees.Over wide
 areas of this patch are small farms   
 consisting largely of{permanent       
{pasture and some grassland for hay.   
{Stock includes dairy and beef cattle  
{and sheep.Milk is supplied to the     
{local dairying industry}for consumpti-
 on in Hastings and St.Leonards.The ne-
 arest market is at Rye.The area also  
 includes a{market gardening industry  
{for fruit}where southern slopes make  
 this a profitable economy.Adams fruit 
 farm employs casual labour intensively
 once crops ripen.Many customers pick  
 and pay for their own needs.Straw-    
 berries predominate but raspberries   
 and blackberries are sent in bulk for 
 freezing and export to Germany and    
 Sweden.                               </content>
