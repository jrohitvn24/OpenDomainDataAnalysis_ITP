		<title>02Traffic Survey.</title>
		<content> Some boys from 1G1 compiled a traffic 
 survey to see how many vehicles went  
 in and out of Stratton Crossroads.    
                                       
 This survey lasted two hours and we   
 had two people at each station.There  
 were 6 stations for vehicles entering 
 and 6 for leaving.When we got back to 
 class we found that if we added the   
 totals together we found that they    
 were almost the same allowing for cars
 which parked or entered Headlands     
 School.                               
                                       
 We found that nearly 1500 vehicles    
 used the junction between 10am and    
 11am and nearly 2000 vehicles between 
 11am and 12 noon.                     
                                       
 This is the busiest junction in       
 North Swindon.                        
                                       </content>
