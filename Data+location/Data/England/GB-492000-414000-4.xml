		<title>04CROPS-PEAS &amp; STRAWBERRIES</title>
		<content>   {PEAS}are grown on a large scale for
 quick freezing at{Grimsby}and are     
 frozen within 90 minutes of being     
 shelled. The varieties and sowing     
 times are arranged so that, in theory,
 at least the crops ripen in succesion 
 over an average of{42/45 day harvest. 
 In order to preserve quality the      
 harvest continues non-stop with two   
 teams of men working the machines.    
    The basic machine is the{podder    
 which strips the pods from the plants,
 then threshes the peas out of the pods
 by a large rotating drum, cleans them 
 by sieves and air blasts.             
    On the land both east and west of  
 Ermine street large acreage is put    
 under{STRAWBERRY cultivation.}The main
 crop is sold to the public who pick   
 their own and pay for it by weight.   
   {This years price (1985) was 22p per
{one pound weight of strawberres.      </content>
