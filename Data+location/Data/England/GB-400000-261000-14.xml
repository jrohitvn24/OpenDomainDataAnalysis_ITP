		<content> WHY WE MOVED TO FECKENHAM-A NEWCOMER  
                                       
  We moved to Feckenham because of my  
 husband's work. We wanted a bungalow  
 with a big garden. We were attracted  
 to Feckenham as it was a proper       
 village with a proper village         
 community.                            
  I am very involved with the church   
 and I like the active Sunday school   
 for my children. I like the idea of a 
 village school but it is a mile from  
 my front door to the school.          
   The village shop is important and   
 should be supported.                  
  We were a bit worried that outsiders 
 would not be welcome, but the         
 neighbours called within an hour with 
 a bag of tomatoes.                    
  We like it in the village and feel   
 that the countryside makes up for the 
 lack of amenities.                    </content>
