		<title>01GENERAL VIEW OF M.W./SHIPT.</title>
		<content>      Agriculture dominates the area of
 study.  Allied industries, hauleage   
 contractors, and a large garage and   
 engineering works in Market Weighton  
 are the other main employers.  People 
 who moved to the area, due to low     
 rateable values, are usually          
 white-collar workers and commute to   
 work in nearby cities and towns. These
 new inhabitants are responsible for a 
 more aspiring attitude to life. A     
 Sports Centre was built as a result of
 this changing outlook. Although the   
 agricultural market has ceased, many  
 hostelries remain and are the focal   
 point of adult entertainment. Some    
 recent building developments have     
 marred the character of some areas.   
 Conservation orders have protected    
 buildings for posterity.  Essentially,
 the community is isolated by geography
 and insular by its very nature.       </content>
