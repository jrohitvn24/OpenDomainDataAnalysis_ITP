		<content> The demographic make-ups of Bideford  
 Green, Linslade, and Soulbury are very
 different. Linslade contains a large  
 modern housing estate of mainly young,
 middle class families, many of whom   
 work in London. Houses change hands   
 frequently as the young executives are
 moved round the country constantly.   
 Soulbury started life as a small      
 farming village but is increasingly   
 turning into a commuter area and      
 losing its village identity. In the   
 last few decades the school has gone, 
 the shops have disappeared and the    
 Post Office closed five years ago.    
 Now Soulbury village consists of an   
 increasing number of commuters, many  
 of whom do not take part in the       
 village life and the farming community
 who provide a stable nucleus in the   
 village. Many of the elderly in Soul- 
 bury have lived there all their lives.</content>
