Hartwell is a small village that is set
in a {farming landscape}.Near the      
village is the ancient Salcey Forest.  
The villages of Hartwell,Ashton and    
Roade each have general stores and Post
Offices and Hartwell has a surprising  
number of other wharehouses selling    
office and home furniture and pet food 
supplies.There are few facilities in   
either Ashton or Hartwell,the latter   
has a lot of new housing and this has  
lead to vandalism problems.Hartwell has
only occupied the present site since   
the early 19th century.Aerial photos   
show evidence of forest settlements in 
many places from Neolithic times on.The
roads leading to the villages are poor 
and cause many accidents in winter.This
makes {transport} difficult and costly 
for residents.      Andrew Hunter,11.
