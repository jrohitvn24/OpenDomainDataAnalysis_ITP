		<content> On Tuesday my mum, dad and two        
 brothers and I went to a Safari park. 
 First we saw some deer, some zebras   
 and some elephants, some hippos asleep
 in the mud,then some lions and        
 lionesses. One lioness ran in front of
 a car. Then we saw some monkeys       
 carring their babies.One monkey jumped
 on a car and did a whoopsie on the car
 roof. Another monkey jumped on the    
 front of our car and made a funny face
 at me .Then we had dinner .After we   
 ate our pack lunch we went to the fun 
 fair. First I went on a ghost train   
 then I went on a cable car then I went
 on a peddle boat then I was going to  
 go on a rainbow ride I was to small.So
 I went on a horse ride three times and
 got very dizzy. Then I got onto the   
 steam train to see my mum and then    
 went home.                            
                                       </content>
