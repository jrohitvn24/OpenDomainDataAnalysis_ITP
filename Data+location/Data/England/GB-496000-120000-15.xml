		<title>15Petworth Helps Ethiopians</title>
		<content> Each sack was marked "Petworth        
 Ethiopia Relief Supplies SIM Aid".    
 S.I.M. stands for Sudan Interior      
 Mission. The two lorries were loaded  
 by a yellow fork_lift truck. We found 
 out that there are 12 feeding stations
 in the Humbo region of Wolayata where 
 the grain is going. The grain will    
 travel from Petworth on lorry to      
 Goole,Humberside and then ship to     
 Ethiopia. The farmers who helped were 
 Mr.Riddell, Mr.Waterman, Mr.Gadd,     
 Lord Egremont and Mr.Tupper. We did it
 because we saw the awful television   
 pictures of the famine in Ethiopia,and
 decided that we needed to do something
 about it.
