		<title>14 LOCAL RADIO</title>
		<content>Hereward Radio news goes out every hour
on the airwaves of Northampton from    
6.00a.m. to 3.00a.m. on a frequency of 
1557KH. The radio station has a team of
six journalists. Local news and        
information is first of all gathered by
people reporting in to the station and 
then the station responding by sending 
one of its team members to cover the   
story. For national and international  
news items a derivative of the London  
Broadcasting Company(LBC) known as     
Independent Radio News(IRN)will cover  
such items and contact the local radio 
stations by Telex and/or Audio channels
of communication. When reporting a     
story the journalists use special tape 
recorders for the interviews which are 
recorded onto ordinary tape cassettes. 
These are later transferred to reel    
tapes and edited in the studio before  
being broadcast.                       </content>
