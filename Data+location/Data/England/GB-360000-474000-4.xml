		<title>04Landscape _ Leck area</title>
		<content> Our landscape is generally hilly. The 
 highest part of our block is High Gale
 which is 97 metres above sea level.The
 lowest part in our block is just      
 outside Whittington which is 39 metres
 above sea level.Just outside our block
 to the east it climbs up rapidly to a 
 height of 500 metres above sea level. 
 The settlements in our block are on   
 reasonably flat land because they are 
 closeto rivers.Whittington is on the  
 river Lune.Cowan Bridge,Leck,         
 Overtown,and Burrow are on Leck Beck  
 which joins the Lune at Burrow. The   
 fell land is used for rough grazing of
 sheep and cattle and also for         
 shooting. The lower land is still     
 unsuitable for arable farming so it is
 mostly grazing land with just hay or  
 silage being grown to feed livestock  
 in winter.                            
                                       </content>
