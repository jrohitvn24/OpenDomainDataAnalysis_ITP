		<title>15MIDDLEBROOK MUSHROOMS</title>
		<content> Middlebrooks produce a million        
 mushrooms a day! They have three units
 in the Selby area including the one in
 square 2957 at Gateforth Farm.        
                                       
 Middlebrook Mushrooms are a major     
 employer in the district with 630 jobs
 at the three farms. A fleet of 20     
 vehicles is used to deliver the       
 mushrooms and to collect compost and  
 manure as a growing medium for the    
 mushrooms.                            
                                       
 Mushrooms are sold all over the UK,the
 most distant delivery being to        
 Aberdeen. Customers include Tesco,Asda
 and Marks and Spencer. Middlebrook's  
 large trucks are a common sight on the
 quiet lanes around Thorpe Willoughby.
