		<title>01CLACTON general information</title>
		<content>     Clacton is an historic town with  
 two very old churches, both mentioned 
 in the old{DOMESDAY BOOK}. As well as 
 the churches there are many other     
 historic houses.                      
     The Clacton area is very flat and 
 as it is beside the sea large walls   
 have had to be built to prevent tidal 
 flooding.                             
     About half of our area is farmland
 which is almost all arable farmland.  
     Clacton pier has made Clacton a   
 holiday resort and there are 14       
 holiday camps mainly for caravans.    
     Clacton is a growing town. There  
 are estates being built everywhere,   
 with more and more commuters coming to
 live here.
