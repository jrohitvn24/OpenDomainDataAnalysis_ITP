		<title>11Housing in Whittle-le-Woods</title>
		<content>   In Whittle-le-Woods there is a      
 mixture of{housing}dating from before 
 the industrial revolution to the      
 present day.                          
   In the village, along the original  
 Chorley - Preston road, are the oldest
 houses which are built of stone from  
 the local{quarries.}                  
   Along both sides of the A6 and      
 between it and the original road there
 are rows of red brick{terraced houses}
 which were built for the people who   
 worked at the{cotton mills}in the     
 area.                                 
   In recent years there has been an   
 infilling of vacant plots with new    
 housing developments and now new      
 green-field estates as part of the    
{Central Lancashire New Town.}         
   Throughout the area old farm        
 buildings have been converted into    
 high quality homes.                   </content>
