 The stud which is a public stud has   
 been in operation since 197O.  There  
 are three stallions standing at       
 present.  The stud and farm comprises 
 about fifty stables and about 1OO     
 mares per season visit from all parts 
 of the country.  Once the mares are in
 foal they return to their owners and  
 return two weeks before the foal is   
 due.  The mare when safely delivered  
 will come into season about ten days  
 later and will be covered by the      
 chosen stallion.  Once pregnancy is   
 confirmed the mare will return once   
 more to its owners.  At the height of 
 the foaling season the hours worked   
 are long and sometimes arduous.  The  
 farm uses the hay it produces to feed 
 the horses and straw is purchased     
 locally.                              
                                       </content>
