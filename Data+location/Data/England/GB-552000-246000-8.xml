		<content> The area which we have been asked to  
 research is full of clubs and         
 associations, of all types e.g.       
 schools, political associations and   
 sports teams. There are brownies,     
 cubs, guides and scouts at both       
 Abington and Linton. Abington &amp; Linton
 also have football and cricket teams. 
 Hildersham also has a cricket team,   
 but is perhaps too small to have many 
 other clubs. Parent teacher           
 associations exist for Abington Play  
 and Primary Schools, &amp; Linton Village 
 College. Pubs have teams such as darts
 at the Three Tuns, Abington, and the  
 Pear Tree at Hildersham. An unusual   
 group is the Cambs Salad Producers    
 which helps the production &amp; sale of  
 salads at what used to be the Land    
 Settlement Association. There are     
 Young Farmers Clubs in Abington &amp;     
 Linton.                               </content>
