		<title>04THE QUEEN'S VISIT</title>
		<content>      It was a cold and misty day at   
 Oakham. All the Oakham students were  
 waiting expectantly for the big       
 moment. The{Queen}had accepted an     
 invitation to come to{Oakham School}to
 celebrate its quatercentenary. Soon a 
 cheer spread through the pupils. A    
 convoy of six large cars drove up     
 Deanscroft drive. The large swarm of  
 security officers keeping their eyes  
 peeled for anything suspicious. At    
 last the car door swung open and out  
 stepped the Queen, who was then taken 
 to see a girls' boarding house, while 
 the Duke met some members of the{Duke 
{of Edinburgh}award scheme. After this 
 the couple moved onto the new{Oakham  
{Theatre,}which the Queen was to open  
 formally. After lunch with the school 
 in the Ashburton Hall the Queen and   
 the Duke left. An enjoyable day !
