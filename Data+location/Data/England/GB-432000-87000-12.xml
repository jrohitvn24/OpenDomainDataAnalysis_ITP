		<title>12LOCAL HISTORY THE MILL</title>
		<content> Yarmouth Mill was built in 1793 of    
 brick with a slate roof. It was       
 originally  one of the few tidal      
 mills but later used a steam engine in
 conjunction with the tidal force.Once 
 it was a thriving business exporting  
 corn to the mainland. Ships were able 
 to sail right up Mill Creek to berth  
 outside the building. The Mill has now
 been converted to a private house and 
 is owned by a well known historian's  
 family.
