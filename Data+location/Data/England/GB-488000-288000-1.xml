		<title>01General Review,  Corby</title>
		<content>This block covers the centre of Corby  
New Town. Corby is a town undergoing   
many changes at the moment. In 1939 it 
was a sleepy village of less than 2,000
people. Stewarts and Lloyds, a steel   
company, built a steelworks to the east
of the town and it began to grow       
rapidly. People were attracted to the  
town, particularly from Scotland, for  
both jobs and housing and the town was 
designated as a New Town in 1950. The  
growth of the town was directed by the 
New Towns Commission, a Govt. group.   
The population grew steadily to 50,000 
by 1979. The local iron ore, poor in   
quality, meant the works were          
superceded by integrated Iron and Steel
works on coastal sites using imported  
iron ore from Sweden. This led to the  
closure of the steelworks in 1979,     
though the Tube making plant remains.  
10,340 workers were made redundant.    </content>
