		<title>09CHANGES AT CASTLE BYTHAM.</title>
		<content> Fifteen years is not a long time in   
 historical terms but even so there    
 have been noticeable changes during   
 that time.In the 1960's the majority  
 of the children's parents worked in   
 the village.The two main areas of     
 employment were the surrounding farms 
 and the limestone quarry situated near
 the centre of the village.Increased   
 mechanisation meant fewer jobs were   
 available locally and gradually the   
 old order of life changed.Previously  
 several generations of a family would 
 pass through the school register.This 
 now began to stop as local people     
 moved away to find work.New families  
 moved into the village_in most cases  
 their places of work were many miles  
 away.The car now linked the village   
 firmly with the wider world.It still  
 remains,however,a peaceful,pleasant   
 place.                                </content>
