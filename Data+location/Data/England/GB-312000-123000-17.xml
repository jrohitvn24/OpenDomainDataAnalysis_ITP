		<title>17HOUSES IN MILVERTON</title>
		<content>     ON WEDNESDAY, 10TH JULY, WE WENT  
 TO LOOK AT HOUSES IN MILVERTON. IN    
 FORE STREET THE HOUSES ARE OLD. SOME  
 ARE MADE OF SANDSTONE. SOME ARE       
 COVERED IN PEBBLE DASH AND PAINTED    
 DIFFERENT COLOURS. THE HOUSES HAVE    
 MOSTLY GOT TWO STOREYS, SOME HAVE GOT 
 THREE. THERE IS NO ROOM FOR THEM TO   
 HAVE A FRONT GARDEN, BUT THEY HAVE    
 POTS AND PLANTS GROWING UP THEM. SOME 
 OF THE HOUSES ARE VERY PRETTY.        
                                       
      THEN WE WENT TO CREEDWELL        
 ORCHARD. THE BUILDINGS THERE ARE ALL  
 NEW FLATS AND BUNGALOWS. THEY ARE MADE
 OF RED AND ORANGE BRICKS. THE ROOF    
 TILES ARE CORRUGATED AND HAVE ORANGE  
 LICHEN GROWING ON THEM. THE GROUND    
 FLOOR FLATS AND THE BUNGALOWS HAVE    
 LITTLE GARDENS AROUND THEM. ON OUR    
 WALK WE NOTICED THAT ONLY FOUR HOUSES 
 DID NOT HAVE TELEVISION AERIALS.      </content>
