		<content> Our survey shows that more families   
 have dogs than cats.Only 16% out of a 
 hundred people  had rabbits,mainly    
 because they are cheap to keep.6% had 
 ponies.Not many people have ponies    
 now,as they cost a lot to keep.4% had 
 roosters,8% had guinnea-pigs and      
 another 4% had hamsters.Only one      
 family had tadpoles.This means dogs   
 are more popular than any other       
 animals.Sometimes other stranger      
 animals are kept.One family had a     
 lobster and a snake!Animals are kept  
 mainly for children to love and care  
 for.
