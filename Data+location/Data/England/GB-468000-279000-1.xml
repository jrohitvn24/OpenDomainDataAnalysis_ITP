  The 8 figure grid reference gave us  
a rectangle 4 miles S.W. of Market     
Harborough, which is a market town in  
the East Midlands.                     
  The area includes the village of     
Clipson as its main focus of           
habitation, as well as the site of the 
Battle of Naseby, which took place in  
1645.  Seven farms are included in the 
rectangle, with many acres of arable   
farmland between them.                 
  The terrain is gently undulating with
the land at between 129 and 192 metres 
above sea level.  The River Ise flows  
SW to NE through the area.             
  The main road serving the area is the
B4036 which runs from Market Harborough
to Daventry.  All others are minor     
roads.  Ours can undoubtably be        
described as a rural landscape.
