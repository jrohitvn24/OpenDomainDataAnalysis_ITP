		<title>10A Day in the Life...a Child</title>
		<content>  My name is Andrew Mark Dobson,and I  
 live in School Road in Peak Dale.I am 
 nine years old.                       
  Today my day started at eight o'clock
 when I woke up and got out of bed.I   
 went down the stairs to get dressed   
 and have my breakfast.I had cornflakes
 for my breakfast.After breakfast I    
 watched the television.I watched TVam 
 for half an hour then I had a wash and
 went to school.I go to Peak Dale      
 County Primary School which is just   
 down the road from my house.          
  At school I played with my friends   
 until the whistle went.Then I went    
 inside.First we had an assembly.Mr    
 Richards told us a story about King   
 Midas _ everything he touched turned  
 to gold.After assembly all the classes
 went back to their classrooms to work.
 My class works in the hall.My teacher 
 is Mr Woodward.                       </content>
