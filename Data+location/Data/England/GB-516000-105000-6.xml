 The village of Lancing is actually two
 communities-North &amp; South Lancing.The 
 orginal centre was North Lancing with 
 it's Norman church,Manor and cluster  
 of farm houses.The inhabitants were   
 known as 'Rooks'.                     
  There was no nucleus in South        
 Lancing-just a single street called   
 'steetend' that led to the beach.The  
 inhabitants were known as             
 'seagulls'.Only fields and orchards   
 lay between the two villages.         
  In the last fifty years there has    
 been agreat change.The manor has been 
 sold and houses have been built on the
 fields.Industry has taken over from   
 farming.                              
  In North Lancing there are some very 
 old tudor houses.Thay timber frames   
 that may have came from the broken    
 ships of the Spanish Armada.          </content>
