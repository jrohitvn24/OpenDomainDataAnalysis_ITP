		<title>06THE VIEW FROM CHURCH GREEN</title>
		<content>  If you were to stand on the top of   
Church Green you would see the River   
Medway and the ships coming into and   
out of the docks or at anchor.  You    
would also see a lot of timber because 
it is one of Medways main imports.     
A view of the two bridges, the train   
and the vehicle bridge is also         
possible.  Taller ships can not pass   
under these bridges.  There are many   
private pleasure crafts on the River   
Medway.                                
  Alongside the river you can see      
cranes that pick-up the cargo from     
ships.                                 
  In the Medway you can see orange     
and yellow buoys that mark the depth   
of the channels so that the bigger     
ships would not run aground.
