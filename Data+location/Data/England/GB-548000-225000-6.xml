		<content>  In Stansted Mountfitchet we have 7   
 free newspapers a week, 6 on Thursday 
 and 1 on wednesday. They are the      
 Gazette, the Property Paper, the      
 Reporter, the Midweek Star, the       
 Motoring Paper, the Saffron Walden    
 Weekly News and the Clasified. Each   
 week we get 600 gms weight of free    
 newspapers and during the year we get 
 31.2 kgms weight and 9360 pages of    
 free papers. For delivering 159 copies
 of the Saffron Walden Weekly News, a  
 paper girls weekly wage is Â£2.95p. I  
 wondered where the money came from for
 the papers. I looked through the      
 Gazette and worked out that 70% of the
 paper was made up of advertisments    
 which the advertisers pay for. With   
 the kind permission of the editor Mr  
 Kenneth Burley I visited the Harlow   
 Gazette Office to see a paper being   
 made.                                 </content>
