		<content> The slow journey along the            
 meandering River Tees.                
 Almost at at end.Our destination ahead
 We sigh with relief.                  
 All is as quiet as can be.            
 All that can be heard                 
 Is the lapping of the waters as they  
 gently flow along with the tide.      
 The"Three Brothers"is made fast at the
 jetty.                                
 Unloading the cargo quickly,quietly.  
 Stealthily we make our way towards the
 inn.                                  
 Creepng down the dark,gloomy tunnel at
 dead of night.                        
 Smells of dampness and moss fill our  
 nostrils.                             
 We approach the cellar,customs men    
 snoring fast asleep.                  
 Whispers of smugglers as deals are    
 completed.                            
 Gently steal away,into the night.     </content>
