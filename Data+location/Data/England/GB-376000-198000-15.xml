 1855 with land and finance given by a 
 local mill owner,Mary Sheppard.       
 The school has approximately 100      
 children on roll in 1985. There are at
 present 4 full time teachers,including
 the Headteacher,and one part-time

 a cook,a kitchen assistant,two

 and the age range is from 4 to 11.    
 At eleven,the children transfer to the
 local comprehensive school. Our school
 has four classes. The reception and   
 second year infants make up Class 1.  
 Second and third year infants make up 
 Class 2. First and second year juniors
