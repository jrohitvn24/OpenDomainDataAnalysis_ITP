		<content> There are 1500 acres managed by Mr.   
 Bond, with a herd of 170 Friesian     
 cows and one bull.   Each cow has one 
 calf a year which is taken away from  
 its mother immediately.   The cows    
 like to be milked at the same time    
 every day and like to be fed at the   
 same time and like to have the same   
 pen.   The milking parlour can hold 16
 cows at a time.   When the cows are   
 being milked they eat food called     
 cake.   In winter the cows stay in a  
 shed and are fed on silage which is   
 made out of grass and maize which are 
 grown here.   Other crops include     
 Wheat and Oilseed Rape.               
 The farm includes the Tindall Wood,   
 designated as an ancient wood.  Nearby
 is the moated farm house of Tindall   
 Hall Farm.
