 Voluntary Controlled County School.The
{J.M.I. School}is for 4\ to 11 year    
 olds and has four classes arranged in 
 academic year groups. There are five  
 main teachers and a Headmaster. The   
 present school building dates back to 
{1854.}The main school to which        
 children transfer is{Knights Templar  
 Comprehensive School,Baldock.This is  
 the only school to which transport is 
 provided by{Herts County Council.     
 Sometimes children transfer to schools
 in nearby Hitchin, Letchworth and
