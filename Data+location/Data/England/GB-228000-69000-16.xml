		<content> There is only one public telephone box
 in Pensilva. Most people have their   
 own telephones. We have estimated that
 there are about 600 private telephones
 in our area.                          
 People using the postal service can   
 buy their stamps at the Post Office.  
 There are three post boxes in the     
 village. The boxes are emptied each   
 morning and afternoon by a postman    
 coming out from Liskeard. The letters 
 are taken into Liskeard and then to   
 Plymouth where they are sorted for    
 delivery. There is one delivery to    
 houses each day, usually in the       
 mornings. First class letters mostly  
 arrive the day after posting within   
 the district and second class letters 
 take about three days on average.
