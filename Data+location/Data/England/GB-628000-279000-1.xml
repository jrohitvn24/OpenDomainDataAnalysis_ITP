		<content> South Elmham.                         
 The land in this area is mostly flat. 
 A tributary of the river Waveney forms
 a dale running westwards from the     
 village of Metfield. Trees and hedges 
 were removed in the eastern sector    
 when a WW II Airfield was built, as   
 result this section is very open. Due 
 to fertile clay soils the whole area  
 is under intensive arable management. 
 Other farming enterprises include     
 piggeries, chicken rearing, also some 
 dairying.  Metfield has a population  
 of 335 and for a rural village has    
 several services. St James, a smaller 
 village, does not have many amenities,
 but for a village of its size its an  
 impressve street lighting system.     
 There is little industry, some of     
 those not invovled in agriculture work
 as builders, vehicle breaks and       
 potters.                              </content>
