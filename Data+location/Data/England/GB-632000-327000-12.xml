		<title>12THE GROUNDS OF HONING HALL</title>
		<content> On April 23rd.1985 we tourwd the      
 grounds of Honing Hall. The park is   
 surrounded by a belt of mixed         
 woodland, with individual trees such  
 as oaks and cedars dotted about the   
 pasture. The park is divided into     
 sections by electric fencing so that  
 grazing cattle may be controlled. The 
 old kitchen garden still survives, but
 the brickwork of the walls and        
 buildings shows signs of neglect.Only 
 part of the garden is used for        
 vegetable growing. The remainder is   
 overgrown, but may be used eventually 
 for a tennis court. Other outbuildings
 are in a good state of repair - the   
 stables with the groom's house and    
 carriage shed attached, the estate    
 office, and the carpenters shop, the  
 latter being the only building still  
 in regular use. A large clock         
 dominates the stable courtyard.       </content>
