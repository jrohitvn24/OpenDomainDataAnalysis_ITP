		<content>     Ninety percent of our area (about 
 1010 Hectares) is made up of arable   
 fields. We counted l3 different types 
 of crop growing in the summer of l985.
 These were:_Grass, wheat, barley, wood
 potatoes, oil seed rape, sugar beet,  
 peas, cabbage, lupins, strawberries,  
 brussel sprouts and onions. Of these, 
 grass and wheat account for more than 
 400 Hectares, whereas the last four   
 crops totalled less than 4 Hectares.  
     The peas are grown under contract 
 to frozen food firms in Grimsby such  
 as Birds_eye.  All the sugar beet is  
 taken for processing at the huge sugar
 factory at Bardney. Potatoes are      
 bought and stored by local firms such 
 as Ross at East Kirkby. One such firm 
 uses several aircraft hangers on a    
 disused wartime airfield for this     
 purpose. However even these massive   
 buildings have proved insufficient.   </content>
