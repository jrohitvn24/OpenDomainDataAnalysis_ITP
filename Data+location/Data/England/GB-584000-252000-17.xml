		<content>Daniel aged 9yrs 4mths. Saturday.      
I got up at 8.15, washed,dressed and   
ate my breakfast of scrambled egg on   
toast and a cup of tea. Dad took me to 
the Den to meet Akela and the other Cub
Scouts for Sports Day. I'm in Green Six
First we had heats for 75metre sprint, 
I won my heat and went on to win the   
finals.Next was the Sargeant Jump-I got
7 points for that. Then we were put    
into 3's for the Sack Relay Race-we    
only came 4th but it was great fun, we 
kept falling over. My friend Phillip   
won the Throwing the Cricket Ball(over 
30 metres).After a break for lunch we  
started the high jump.Then came the 50 
metre Sprint against the clock I took  
8.2 seconds-and got the full 10 points.
In the Tug-of-War we got to the semi-  
finals.Lastly the presentation and I   
had won my Athlete's Badge Stages I &amp;II
What a great day it had been!          </content>
