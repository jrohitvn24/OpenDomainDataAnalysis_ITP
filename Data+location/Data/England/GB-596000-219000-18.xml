		<content>{LAYER CHURCH _}St.John the Baptist    
 The record of the church's existence  
 is in the charter of 1128. The church 
 belonged first to the Abbey of St.John
 in Colchester and then to the Priors  
 of St.Botolph.The monks of St.Botolph 
 had to work hard to rebuild the nave  
 and tower in 1350 after it had been   
 allowed to fall into disrepair as a   
 result of the decrease in population  
 following the Black Death.The church  
 is architecturally an interesting one 
 and the Registers,which date from     
 1752,show the names of the forbears of
 some present day village families.    
{OLD FORGE GARAGE _ }was originally the
 Blacksmith's forge built in the 18th  
 century. The anvil remains inside and 
 the horse_hole is still in the wall.  
 It became a garage in 1920. One of the
 hand petrol pumps is in Colchester    
 Museum.The Morse family own the garage</content>
