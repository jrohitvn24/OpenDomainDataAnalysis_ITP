		<content> This is part of the Parish of Over    
 Wyresdale. It contains the small      
 village of Abbeystead with its primary
 school, Home Fa rm, Estate Office and 
 2 or 3 residences. Other similar small
 groups of residences are found at     
 Tarnbrook Lower Lee and at Marshaw.   
 The area is designated as part of the 
 Bowland area of outstanding natural   
 beauty. The whole of the land is owned
 by the Grosvenor Estates. The main    
 occupation is farming and estate      
 workers viz gamekeepers, gardeners,   
 woodmen. The farms are hill farms with
 a flock of heath going sheep In spite 
 of extensive drainage in recent years 
 the lands remains generally wet. This 
 being due to a combination of high    
 rainfall and the soil composition     
 which is, in the main, peat on clay.
