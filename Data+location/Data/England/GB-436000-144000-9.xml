   At the Magistrates Court they start 
 at 10 am and usually go on until      
 lunchtime.Sometimes they go on until  
  5 pm.                                
   If the case is very serious they    
 will send the defendant to the Crown  
 Court. The cases they get are not     
 always very bad.                      
   If you are under 17 and you have    
 committed a crime you get sent to a   
 juvenile court and could get punished.
   If you are under 17 and you commit a
 serious crime you could get sent to a 
 detention home centre.                
   If you're over 17 you will be fined.
 If it is a little bit more serious    
 you could be sent to prision for up to
 6 months if the crime is very serious 
 you could be tried in the Crown Court.
   You could be sent to prison for up  
 to 30 years if necessary.             </content>
