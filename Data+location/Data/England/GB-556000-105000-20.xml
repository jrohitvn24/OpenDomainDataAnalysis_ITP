		<content>{SKIPPING}I ENJOY SKIPPING WITH MY     
 FRIENDS.YOU GET IN THE MIDDLE AND THE 
 OTHER PEOPLE TURN THE ROPE.WHEM THE   
 ROPE COMES TO YOUR FEET YOU JUMP EVERY
 TIME IT COMES AROUND.IF YOU WANT YOU  
 CAN SING A SONG TO GO WITH IT.WHEN YOU
 JUMP SAY "HIGH LOW DOLLY ROCKER" UNTIL
 THE PERSON WHO'S SKIPPING, TRIPS.     
{KING,CAN,COPPER}YOU HAVE A CAN AND    
 SOMEONE'S IT.YOU GO AND HIDE.THE      
 PERSON WHO'S"IT"COUNTS TO 50 AND TRIES
 TO FIND YOU.IF WHEN HE IS LOOKING FOR 
 YOU, YOU KICK THE CAN,HE TRIES TO GET 
 THE CAN BACK BEFORE YOU HAVE HIDDEN   
 AGAIN.IF HE DOES, YOU ARE "IT".       
{BASE CHASE}THE IDEA IS TO SET YOUR    
 TEAM FREE FOR AS LONG AS YOU CAN.ONE  
 PERSON IS "IT".THE REST RUN AWAY FROM 
 HIM.IF THE PERSON WHO IS "IT" TOUCHES 
 YOU, YOU MUST SIT BACK AT THE PLACE   
 FROM WHERE YOU STARTED. TO SET YOU    
 FREE ANOTHER PERSON HAS TO TOUCH YOU. </content>
