		<content> When I wake up in the morning I get   
 dressed and go downstairs to have my  
 breakfast. After breakfastI pack my   
 bag. I put in my shorts and           
 tracksuit.I call for Nicholas at      
 twenty five past eight and we walk to 
 school. When we get to school we hang 
 our coats up and go into the classroom
 and I talk to Antony about motorbikes 
 till the bell goes. When the bell goes
 our names are called by the teacher so
 the teacher knows if we are all here. 
 Next we go in the other room for      
 assembley. We sing a hymn which is a  
 song  then the teacher tells us a     
 story. After the story we say a prayer
 then we go back  to the other room.   
 For English we do  S.R.A. cards. You  
 have to read a story then answer some 
 questions about the story. At twenty {
 to eleven  we have play time .We play 
 football and then we come in for maths</content>
