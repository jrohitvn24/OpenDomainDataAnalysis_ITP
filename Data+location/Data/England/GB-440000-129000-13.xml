		<title>13CHURCH FETE,SPARSHOLT.</title>
		<content>  The fete takes place in one of the   
 big local houses every year to raise  
 money for the church in Sparsholt.It  
 has taken place annually for over 50  
 years.                                
  This year the Windband,from the      
 School,played at the fete.There are   
 lots of stalls that you can buy       
 things from.At the coconut shy you    
 have to knock coconuts off with a     
 ball.The best stall is the bottle     
 stall,it costs 10p to have a go and   
 you have to put your hand into a box  
 and pull out a cube.Some cubes are    
 blank and some have numbers, if you   
 get one of these you win a bottle of  
 drink.There is also a lucky dip.
