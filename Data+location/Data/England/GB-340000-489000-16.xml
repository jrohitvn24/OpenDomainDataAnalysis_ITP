		<content>{Mr.Ivan Waller}is a well known{rock

 various parts of the country.He came  
 to live in Crosthwaite because he     
 likes the area and it gives him access
 to all parts of the Lake District.He  
 has climbed all the mountains in the  
 Lakes and all those in the British    
 Isles over{3000}ft.He has climbed in  
 the company of other famous climbers, 
 notably{Chris Bonnington and Lady     
{Hunt.}When he was at college he needed
 exercise so a former housemaster who  
 remembered that as a small boy he had 
 liked climbing trees suggested that   
 he take up rock climbing.He began in  
 1925 learning from an open book as he 
 tackled the rocks.He retired from work
 in 1969 but still enjoys climbing.Now 
 he is grateful for someone to carry   
 his heavy equipment.
