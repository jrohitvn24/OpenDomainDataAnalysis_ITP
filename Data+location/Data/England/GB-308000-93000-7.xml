		<title>07A TYPICAL FRIDAY</title>
		<content> until the whistle goes and then we    
 go in classes. When we get into our   
 classrooms we all line up for assembly
 but people in the orchestra go first  
 so they can get their music ready. On 
 Friday we have a Friday guest. After  
 assembly we come back to our          
 classroom.The sort of work we normally
 do is maths and english and reading.At
 twenty to eleven we go out for our    
 morning play time and we can eat fruit
 or crisps.When the whistle goes we all
 go in and carry on with our work. When
 twelve o'clock comes the people who   
 have hot lunches go up to the hall and
 then at twenty to one the people who  
 have packed lunches go into the hall  
 to have their lunch. At half past two 
 we go out for our afternoon play      
 time. After playtime we come into the 
 classroom and we often have a         
 story then after that we go home.     </content>
