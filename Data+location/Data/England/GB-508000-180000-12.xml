		<title>12LIFE IN YEADING</title>
		<content>  We enjoy living in Yeading because   
 lots of things happen. In July each   
 year we have a{carnival.}People dress 
 up in different clothes and decorate  
 vehicles. Then they drive around the  
 streets to let everyone see how       
 beautiful they look. All the floats   
 collect together at Hayes Sports      
 ground to be judged. Each year we have
 a{fair.}It is very exciting going to  
 the fair because it is bright and     
 colourful. It makes you laugh and cry,
 because part of it is frightening.    
 Each year the willows school invites  
 other schools to their{summer fete.   
 Thry play lots of games and we win    
 lots of prizes. St Edmunds has a big  
{jumble sale}outside the church every  
 year.                                 
  So you can see life in Yeading is    
 very interesting.
