		<content> A new road connecting the London      
 Orbital motorway with Tilbury Docks   
 cuts through farmland to the east of  
 Little Thurrock. Wheat is grown on    
 these slopes and on the drained       
 marshes. This new road has led to many
 local shops losing business, as a     
 superstore in Tilbury and one at West 
 Thurrock, adjacent to the M25, have   
 claimed a great deal of the local     
 retail business.                      
  The parade of shops on Lodge Lane has
 felt this effect keenly, trade has    
 suffered and some staff have been laid
 off. The Parade includes a small      
 supermarket,2 grocers,3 hot food take-
 aways,a dry cleaners,a dog care       
 parlour, an off licence, office       
 supplies, a chemist, 2 newsagents,    
 antiques,fabrics,furniture repairs,2  
 Building Societies and a popular local
 public house, The Oak.                </content>
