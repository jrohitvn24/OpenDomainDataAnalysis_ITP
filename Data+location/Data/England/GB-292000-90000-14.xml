		<title>14BURNTHOUSE LANE ESTATE</title>
		<content>  My friends and I go to Bradley Rowe  
 Middle School on this large housing   
 estate.When Councillor Mrs Johns moved
 into her home in 1928 there were only 
 a few houses.There were no pavements  
 or street lights.Gradually the estate 
 grew and our school was opened in 1931
 The original street lights were gas   
 and lit by a man each evening.Now they
 are electric and switched on          
 automatically.                        
  Mrs Johns left school at 14 but we   
 leave at 16.She earned 8 shillings    
 (40p) a week and walked to work       
 because she could not afford to catch 
 the bus in both directions.Mr Daw left
 school at 16 in 1921 and worked in his
 father's bakery for 10 shillings(50p) 
 a week.On Sundays people brought their
 roast dinners to be baked in the coal 
 fired ovens,paying a penny(0.4p) each.
 Now each home has its own cooker      </content>
