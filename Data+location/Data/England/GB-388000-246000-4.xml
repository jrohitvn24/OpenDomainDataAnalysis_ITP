 Lole who rents Hermitage farm that a  
 brand new Combined harvester costs    
 about Â£38000, a new fork lift truck   
 costs Â£15000. At Hermitage farm they  
 use a lot of machinery like a mower,  
 plough, grain trailer, hay tedder,    
 elevator and a bail sledge.A bail     
 sledge can carry 12 bails of hay.Mr   
 Lole the farmer has 5 tractors on his 
 farm. One of the 5 tractors is 78     
 horse power another is 100 horse      
 power. One of the tractors, that is 78
 horse power, can have three types of  
 back wheels.                          
 Hermitage farm was one of the first   
 farms to have computerisation in the  
 Herefordshire and Worcestershire      
 district. The computers used were a   
 make called Apple. The computers help 
 by calculating how much to spray the  
 crops.                                </content>
