		<content> This is a rural area containing the 3 
 small villages of Staplefield,        
 Warninglid and Slaugham. It is        
 predominantly agricultural with farms 
 scattered evenly over the area. There 
 are quite a lot of fairly large houses
 although most of the residences tend  
 to be centred near the 3 villages.As  
 the area is near the two major        
 population centres of Crawley  and    
 Haywards Heath it is visited by many  
 people who enjoy the countryside      
 walks,quaint pubs, ponds, woods and   
 the general quietness.                
     Staplefield is a small village    
 situated in  the east of the area. It 
 consists  of a number of houses       
 centred around a common.There are two 
 public houses, a primary school, a    
 school for handicapped children,      
 protestant church, catholic  chapel,  
 village hall and voluntary shop.      </content>
