		<content> Hanham Court stands about 3 miles from
 Bristol.Earnulf de Hesding lived in   
 Hanham at the time of Domesday.In 1329
 it was conveyed to the abbey of       
 Keynsham.In the reign of Queen Mary it
 was sold to a wealthy London cloth    
 worker,John Lang.In 1638 Thomas       
 Colston of Bristol sold it to the     
 Creswicke family,who held it for just 
 over 200years.Henry Creswicke was     
 Mayor of Bristol in 1660. Francis     
 Creswicke discovered that the rebels  
 of the Duke of Monmouth's army were   
 camped on his land in Keynsham.He     
 dared not move them on and later was  
 condemned to death for helping them.  
 His friends got the sentence changed  
 to prison just in time.In 1687 James  
 II ate breakfast under an oak tree    
 which still stands.Now Mr FM Stevens  
 has lived there since 1923.
