		<title>16RECREATION_SPORTS CENTRE_</title>
		<content>  Stanley Louisa centre took 3 years to
 build.It was finally completed on the 
 8th of April 1980.It was opened by the
 Chairman of Derwentside District      
 Council.The sports centre employs 6   
 full staff workers and 16 part time   
 staff.Altogether the building has 2   
 court halls,6 squash courts,a wieght  
 training room,a projectile room,a club
 room and a creche.The Louisa centre is
 more popular in winter than in summer.
 The main hall is used most for        
 badminton and 5 aside football. There 
 is no particular age group that go to 
 the Louisa because both children and  
 adults from the under 5 creche to the 
 over 50 keep,fit class go.On average  
 the Louisa takes Â£1,200 pounds a week 
 which in an area with low employment  
 shows how popular it must be.The bar  
 is not as popular as some sports      
 facilities but still attracts people. </content>
