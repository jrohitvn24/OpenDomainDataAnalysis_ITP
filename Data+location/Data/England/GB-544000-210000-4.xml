		<title>04HARLOW CHILDREN'S FEARS .</title>
		<content>{We asked some ten year olds what their
{fears and worries about the future    
{were.}Many of them feared death.      
 Others said the following :           
 "I am worried that I might not get a  
 job.I might even be homeless and      
 wandering the streets ."              
 "I worry about coal and other fuels   
 running out ."                        
 "My worries are that in the next      
 couple of years there will be a       
 nuclear war with Russia and we shall  
 be destroyed and I shall be the last  
 survivor ,wandering around with       
 radiation sickness"                   
 "I fear a third world war happening ; 
 then I would have to join up and fight
 against other countries ."            
 "I want to live to the year 10,000 and
 see the new wonders ! I dont want to  
 miss seeing the new developments.I'll 
 probably live to A.D.2070 ."          </content>
