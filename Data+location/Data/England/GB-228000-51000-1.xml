		<content> The small portion of land in square 4 
 of this 'D block' relates in all      
 respects to the adjacent northerly    
 block (02280054) described elsewhere. 
  Much of the original village         
 developed here on the flat clifftop   
 land of the former 'Downderry Farm'.  
  Some of the most important buildings 
 of the community are presently        
 situated in this square e.g the       
 school,the church ,the community      
 centre, and the village pub.          
  It is in this square that all the    
 access to the sea is afforded         
 providing a facility for inshore      
 fishermen,residents and tourists which
 is uncommon in other parts of East    
 Cornwall where the strand is usually  
 isolated by high cliffs.The           
 accessibility of the Low cliff at     
 Downderry has been important in the   
 development of the community.         </content>
