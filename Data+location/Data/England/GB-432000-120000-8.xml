		<title>08KING JOHN'S LODGE ROMSEY</title>
		<content> On 15th May 1915 my Nan was born in   
 King John's Hunting Lodge, the doctor 
 was Dr Van Summers, he was Dutch.  In 
 that year King John's Hunting Lodge   
 was called '6 Church Court'.  She     
 lived there about 6 years.  When she  
 was old enough to work she worked at  
 the Jam Factory.  In the summer, work 
 started at 6 am.  They worked until 9 
 am went home for breakfast and went   
 to work at 10 am.  They worked for two
 hours and then went home for dinner   
 went back to work at 1 pm until 4 pm. 
 The Jam Factory was where Waitrose's  
 is now.  In the summer the wasps used 
 to sting the workers.  In the winter  
 they had to break ice off the top of  
 the barrels of fruit soaking in       
 water.  Nowadays King John's house is 
 used for local meetings of up to about
 50 people.  Pupils from our school    
 perform at poetry and music evenings. </content>
