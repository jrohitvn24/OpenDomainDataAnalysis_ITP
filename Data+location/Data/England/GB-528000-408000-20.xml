		<title>20OLD GRIMSBY CHURCH CUSTOM</title>
		<content> Near our school is a{very old church  
 called Holy Trinity and the Virgin    
 Mary at Old Clee.Today the church     
{floor}is covered in {stone }with a red
{carpet} on top. Hundreds of years ago 
 the floor was{bare earth}and was      
 covered with {rushes}which were cut in
 the marshes close by. They always put 
 clean rushes down for {Trinity Sunday 
 because this was a special day as the 
 church is named after the Trinity.They
 cut{grass}in the{Bescars}instead of   
 rushes because the land had been      
 drained during the{1800's.}Today they 
 cut rushes at{Croxby Ponds, }about 10 
 miles away.They are carried by the    
 people in{procession}to the church on 
 Trinity Sunday and put on the church  
 floor.The hymn'All Things Bright And  
 Beautiful'is sung at this{special     
{evening service}followed by{supper}and
{entertainment}in the{church hall.     </content>
