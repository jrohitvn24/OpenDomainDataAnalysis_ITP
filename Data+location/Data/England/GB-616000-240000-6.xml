		<title>06ORWELL ESTUARY,IPSWICH.</title>
		<content>The wide estuary of the River Orwell   
connects Ipswich with the open North-  
Sea.It is a mud-lined,tidal estuary,   
which runs through beautiful open      
countryside and heavily built up       
industrial areas.                      
   The estuary is shared by both       
leisure craft and ocean going ships.   
The huge container and cargoe vessels, 
ease their way through the buouys and  
  The well marked navigation channel   
and the hundreds of mooring posts for  
private small yachts.  The ocean going 
ships carry cargoes of                 
grain,timber,metal and coal,however,   
Ipswich as a port is under threat from 
the rival port of Felixstowe further   
down the estuary. A big issue of the   
1980's is-"will the port of Ipswich    
suffer from the expansion of           
Felixstowe"? We wait and see!
