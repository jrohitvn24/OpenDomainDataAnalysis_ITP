		<title>19MY LIFE </title>
		<content> I live in Bishampton ---------------  
 -------------------------We have a   
 dog called Ben who was a stray. We    
 have four fish and one tank. We are   
 going to have a kitten, a girl so she 
 gets some babies.  We've got a rabbit 
 and a pony called Honey which we sold.
 My sister ------ was very upset.  I   
 wasn't exactly happy either nor was   
 anybody else.                         
 Our house is about 4OO years old and I
 sleep in the attic. It is quite scary.
 There are seventeen rooms in our      
 house.                                
 I am eight and when I leave Flyford   
 School I will be nine.  I will be     
 going to Pinvin School and then       
 probably to Pershore High School.     
 Then I'll go to University and I'll   
 get a job.
