		<title>19CHERRY BURTON-POTTERY 1</title>
		<content> I fell in love with handthrown pottery
 many years ago on a visit to France.  
 The rich earthy tans and browns of    
 plates,jugs and bowls kindled an      
 interest in pots developing through   
 the years to the point where working  
 with clay has become an essential part
 of my life.In the early years I simply
 collected pots from wherever we       
 holidayed,in the winters joining      
 evening classes to practise the skill.
 As my children grew up I trained as a 
 teacher,the art course extending my   
 interest and appreciation of pottery. 
 In 1975 we moved to Cherry and a      
 chance encounter with a potter gave me
 free time in his workshop learning    
 more about making pots,glazing and    
 firing.On the closure of the pottery I
 decided to leave teaching and become a
 potter.My husband created a workshop, 
 we bought a 2nd-hand kiln and wheel.  </content>
