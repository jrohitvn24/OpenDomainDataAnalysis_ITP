		<content>  There are not very many people who   
 are frightened of ghosts.             
  There is a story that a 17 year old  
 girl haunts a bar every 17th of July  
 at the Golden Lion pub in the town    
 centre opposite the Cromwell statue,  
 but nobody believes it.               
  Some people believe in ghosts and    
 some don't. Most people think ghost   
 stories are good fun and most people  
 think ghosts only appear in stories.  
 People also think that ghosts appear  
 to haunt people and when they haunt   
 people it is to get revenge on them.  
 There doesn't seem to be very many    
 ghost stories around our D-Block.     
 Lots of people are not frightened of  
 ghosts because they have never seen   
 one.Generally not very many people    
 really think there are ghosts in this 
 area!
