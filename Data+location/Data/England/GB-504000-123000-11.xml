		<content> St. Peter ad Vincula is in the diocese
 of Chichester, the deanery of Petworth
 and the see of Canterbury. Services   
 are said daily. On Sundays there are  
 two services. Holy Communion at       
 8.30a.m. and another at 10.30a.m.     
 which may be Holy Communion or a      
 Family Service.                       
      The present vicar is the Rev.    
 Francis Dare. The bells are rung on   
 Sundays before the 10.30a.m. service  
 and the singing is accompanied by an  
 organ. Weddings and funerals are also 
 held at the church.                   
      A Sunday school which teaches    
 religious knowledge is held on        
 Sundays. There are two groups: the    
 Chain or the Cornerstone according to 
 the age of the children.
