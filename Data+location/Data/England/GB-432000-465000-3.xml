		<title>03Transport In Bishop Monkton</title>
		<content> Transport in the area relies almost   
 solely on the internal combustion     
 engine and road traffic,the most      
 popular form being the private car,of 
 which a number of households run 2 or 
 more.Motor-cycles,especially the      
 smaller versions are also quite widely
 used and the increasing cost of fuel  
 has made the pedal cycle more popular 
 than for some years.Public transport  
 consists of a bus service to and from 
 Harrogate and Ripon,the service being 
 7 in each direction daily,but outside 
 school travelling hours these are only
 lightly used.The National coach       
 network does not pass through the     
 area but connection to it is possible 
 through the bus service.              
 There are now no train services       
 through the area but parts of the old 
 track alignment are still visible.    
 The nearest public airport is Yeadon. </content>
