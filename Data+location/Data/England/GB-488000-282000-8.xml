 Mrs Leaton gets up at 7.30am and has  
toast for breakfast. She does any jobs 
that need doing like walking the dog   
and collecting the bread. Then she     
reads. Reading is Mrs Leaton's         
favourite recreation. She also enjoys  
going to the Flower Club and the W.I.  
Then Mrs Leaton picks up her 2 children
from school. They are hungry so Mrs    
Leaton gets the dinner.                
It is time for Mrs Leaton to take Clare
to Brownies. Then she relaxes and      
watches the Antiques Road Show on      
television.                            
Mrs Leaton wants to go on holiday so   
she has booked a holiday to go to West 
Bay.                                   
After a hard days work Mrs Leaton is   
very tired so she has a wash, cleans   
her teeth and goes to bed.
