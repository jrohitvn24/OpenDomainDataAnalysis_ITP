		<title>07SHEPWAY ESTATE, MAIDSTONE</title>
		<content>   This is a large post-war council    
 estate of 340 acres built around a    
 central green and shopping centre. The
 site, once orchards, hops and         
 blackberries, was cleared in 1946 and 
 houses, maisonettes, flats and a small
 number of old people's bungalows have 
 been built. A feature of the estate is
 the large number of communal areas of 
 grassland. Garages were not a priority
 when the estate was originally built  
 and cars now park on grass verges in  
 many of the narrower roads, which are 
 named after counties.                 
   In recent years the council has     
 allowed tenants to purchase their     
 rented property and a small percentage
 have done so.                         
   The estate has its own clinic and is
 well served by two churches, a branch 
 library, a youth club, two primary    
 schools, and frequent bus services.   </content>
