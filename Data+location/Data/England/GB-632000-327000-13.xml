		<title>13A HONING LOCAL CHARACTER</title>
		<content> Mrs. Harvey was born in 1892 in the   
 house where she still lives and where 
 both her parents were born. They died 
 after she was married and she and her 
 husband moved in and her children were
 born there. She has seen many changes 
 take place in village life and on the 
 land.In her day there were many more  
 families with more children. When she 
 was young,children went to a school at
 5 and stayed there until they were 14.
 There were many more children in the  
 village, therefore the school was well
 filled. Farmworkers were very poor and
 the children had to walk miles to     
 school. Everybody, she remembers, used
 to go to church. There were even      
 enough people to form a choir. Now the
 congregation numbers about 15. She    
 remains in good health and enjoys     
 life.(The number of such indigenous   
 families is decreasing steadily)      </content>
