		<title>07THE CHURCH_PRESENT &amp; FUTURE</title>
		<content> A village church plays an important   
 part in the life of the community:so  
 St.Nicholas Church aims to be a focal 
 point for the people of this area;a   
 place where people can not only       
 worship,but a place too,where people  
 can learn to understand God &amp; learn to
 understand each other.It should be a  
 place where the community shares the  
 joys &amp; sorrows of life as well as     
 meeting for the fun &amp; interest of     
 social activities.Here are performed  
 the three special ceremonies of life_ 
 baptism,marriage &amp; death.The yearly   
 average is                            
 Baptisms_14;Marriages_14;Burials_13.  
 For the future,the church under the   
 direction of its present Rector,Rev.P.
 Dennis,hopes to be more of a listening
 church,hopes to be more welcoming to  
 strangers,more adventurous &amp; more     
 prepared to try new &amp; different things</content>
