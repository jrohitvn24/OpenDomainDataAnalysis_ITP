		<title>16An outdoor game for girls</title>
		<content> The game 'elastic' is usually a girl's
 game. A long piece of elastic tied to 
 make a loop is required. The game is  
 for three or more children. Two stand 
 a short distance from each other with 
 their feet apart and the elastic      
 stretched around their ankles.The     
 others take in turn to jump in and out
 of the elastic.The two with the       
 elastic then put their feet together  
 and the others repeat the jumps. The  
 ones with the elastic then remove one 
 leg from the loop and the jumps are   
 repeated. For the final jump of the   
 first round the two stand with their  
 feet as wide apart as possible. For   
 the second round the elastic is moved 
 up to the knees and all jumps repeated
 then the elastic is moved up to the   
 thighs. You are out if you stand on   
 the elastic or miss a jump.
