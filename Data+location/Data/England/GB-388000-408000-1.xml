 The area covered in our 4 x 3 km.     
 block is very varied.                 
      Situated to the south of Rochdale
 centre, it includes farming areas as  
 well as a large housing estate; a     
 country park as well as an industrial 
 estate and the substantial suburb of  
 Castleton, as well as part of Oldham. 
      Through our block run major      
 communication links. The M62 motorway 
 from Liverpool to Hull and the A627M  
 from Rochdale to Oldham cross this    
 block, as do the Rochdale Canal, which
 runs from Manchester to Yorkshire, and
 the railway line from Manchester to   
 Leeds.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
