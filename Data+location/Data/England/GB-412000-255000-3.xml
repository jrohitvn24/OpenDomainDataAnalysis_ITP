		<title>03SOCIAL CHANGES,HASELOR WARKS</title>
		<content> I went to my Grandma's house the other
 day to talk to her about the changes  
 in Haselor.  She thinks that the      
 Moody's house is the oldest because it
 has a Georgian front and Elizabethian 
 back,it was once a little school.She  
 thinks that people are not so friendly
 as they were because fewer people had 
 cars in earlier days so they looked   
 for friendship and recreation in the  
 village. The only shop she remembers  
 is the post office,she also knows that
 there were mobile shops, there was an 
 oil man who came on Friday and a      
 greengrocer girl.When we started to   
 talk about the church, she said that  
 it had never changed that she knew of.
 She also said that the post office has
 moved from Ide cottage to its present 
 position.                             
                                       
                                       </content>
