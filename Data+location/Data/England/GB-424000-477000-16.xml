		<content> ON FRIDAYS I GET UP AT 6.30AM. DRESS  
 AND WASH.  I GO DOWNSTAIRS AND LET THE
 DOGS OUT AND TAKE THEM FOR A WALK TO  
 THE OLD QUARRY.  I PLAY ON MY B.M.X.  
 BIKE UNTIL BREAKFAST,AFTER WHICH I    
 PREPARE FOR SCHOOL.  MY DAD DRIVES    
 TOM, MY BROTHER AND ME TO WEST        
 TANFIELD SCHOOL.  I PLAY WITH FRANCIS

 A HORSE BOX BEHIND.
