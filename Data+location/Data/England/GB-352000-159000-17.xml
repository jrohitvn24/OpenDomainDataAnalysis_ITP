		<title>17Employment in Rural Areas</title>
		<content> Finding work is always a problem in   
 rural areas. Agriculture is the main  
 industry and provides some employment;
 there are a few jobs with Bristol     
 Waterworks in connection with the     
 Reservoirs and the leisure activities 
 of fishing and sailing. The 1 shop    
 and 2 pubs do not offer much scope but
 a good many households do "Bed &amp;      
 Breakfast" for visitors.              
   A new enterprise with hopeful       
 prospects is the establishment of a   
 light industrial and craft centre in  
 Chew Stoke at the site of an old      
 dairy. Private capital has been       
 invested in 12 units converted from   
 old farm buildings; electricity and   
 car parking are provided. The workers 
 provide their own tools and machinery 
 and a variety of trades are already   
 established. Self-employment is often 
 the best chance of work in 1985.      </content>
