		<title>17THE VILLAGE OF EATHORPE</title>
		<content>     {Mrs Reeve}has lived in Eathorpe  
 for 55 years and the village has had  
 very few changes during that time.    
 Only 3 houses have been built. When   
 she came to the village nearly        
 everyone worked either in or around   
 the village on the land. They got to  
 work on bikes or foot.Most of the     
 people used to work in the village but
 now they work in Coventry or          
 Leamington. During the day the village
 is empty yet at night there are cars  
 all down the main street.             
     The village never had its own     
  {Blacksmith}but it had one that came 
 from another village.He shod mainly   
 working horses.Now he shoes riding    
 horses and ponies.The{Water Mill }was 
 used for grinding corn to make flour  
 for the bread. The bread was made at  
 the{Bakehouse.}
