		<title>12Transport in the Horton area</title>
		<content> Horton is quite well served for       
 transport.There are two bus services. 
 These are the 323 and 329,Bristol to  
 Hawkesbury Upton,with two buses in    
 each direction per day.There are two  
 bus stops in the village.Most of the  
 people who live in the Horton area    
 think that the bus service is quite   
 good.Not many people travel by bus,   
 however- most households have one or  
 more cars and people are much more    
 likely to make journeys by car rather 
 than by bus.Some of the residents of  
 Horton who we interviewed said that   
 the village was suffering from too    
 much traffic.We found that this was   
 not the case.In one hour the only     
 traffic to pass was- 46 cars,5 cycles 
 2 buses,10 goods lorries,5 tractors,  
 and 3 vans.Little Sodbury is an even  
 quieter village.
