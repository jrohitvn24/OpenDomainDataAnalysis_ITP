		<title>08   Coleford Post Office</title>
		<content> On Wednesday 19th June a group from   
 our school went to{Coleford}post      
 office.We had to stay there for a     
 little while because the{shopkeeper   
 had not come.When she came she took us
 in the {post office}where the{stamps} 
 and{Giro bank}was.While we were there 
 we asked  her some questions.  How    
 long have you worked here ?           
   She said she had worked here for    
 eleven years.                         
{    } When was the post office built? 
  It was  built in 1969.Then we went   
 out into the shop and  the{postmaster 
 came in and we asked him some         
 questions.We went and saw the{shop    
 where they had all the things that    
 they sold.   In the{shop}were lots of 
 things like sweets, food, painting    
 things,  etc.                         
 The{shopkeeper}told us that we could  
 have some leaflets.                   </content>
