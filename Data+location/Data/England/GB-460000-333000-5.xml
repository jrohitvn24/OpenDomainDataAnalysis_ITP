		<content>{Blacksmith's Forge, (Forge Stores)    
{Plumtree, Nottinghamshire}            
 The forge ceased to be a working      
 smithy in the 1950's. It is now a     
 private residence and a storeroom for 
 the village shop. It still has an     
 unusual horseshoe shaped arch around  
 the doorway, built into the           
 brickwork.There are only three like it
 in the country, two of the others     
 being in Nottinghamshire. Once a      
 listed building, it still attracts a  
 good deal of attention, particularly  
 from people taking part in "car       
 rallys" who want to know how many     
 nails are in it.
