		<title>05Education-Cause for Concern</title>
		<content>  Residents of the northern sector of  
 our 'D' Block expressed concern about 
 the present position of education.    
  Their greatest worry was that the    
 reduction in the numbers of children  
 attending the schools had resulted in 
 a reduction in the numbers of teachers
 and an increase in class size.We      
 carried out a detailed survey of one  
 school and found that in 1980 there   
 were 348 children and 14 teachers,    
 ratio  24.8 to 1. At present there are
 255 children and 10 teachers , a ratio
 of 25.5 to 1.Whereas in 1980 the      
 largest class had only 30 children,   
 because of the differences in numbers 
 in each year group there are now 35   
 children in the largest class and 27  
 children in the smallest. The staff,  
 parents and children all believe that 
 when children are in too large classes
 learning is impeded.                  </content>
