		<content>  Trimingham is one of the highest     
 points in Norfolk. Although the cliffs
 are about 70 meters high access to the
 shore is possible down the 'bomb      
 disposal' gangway.                    
  The highest part of The Beacon was   
 used as a Radar Station during the 2nd
 World War, the beaches were mined to  
 protect the station and as they took  
 many years to clear the gangway was   
 named after the disposal regiment.    
  The Radar instalations were removed  
 and the land sold, but the main area  
 has once more been aquired by the     
 Ministry of Defence _ it is now secret
 but shows little sign of use.         
  The village itself straggles along   
 the coast. It is slowly decreasing in 
 acerage as the cliffs break up and    
 topple into the sea.                  
  Farming and tourism are the only     
 industries, people commute to work.   </content>
