		<title>07LIVING AT MORWELLHAM</title>
		<content>   About 40 people live at Morwellham. 
{Mrs Ayres}lives at 18 Morwellham      
 cottages.She has three daughters.     
   It is very quiet  and they don't get
 disturbed by visitors to the Centre.  
 There are lots of coaches full of     
 school children that come to visit    
 Morwellham.                           
   {Lord Bradford}owns the cottages    
 and they all have people living in    
 them.Her house was once 2 small ones. 
    The main problem is transport.There
 is only one bus a week to Tavistock   
 and it is difficult to get supplies.If
 the river floods in winter they cannot
 get out as the road is covered.       
  {Mrs Ayres}uses a Rayburn to cook on 
 which uses wood and coke.There is     
 little for teenagers to do.           
   Mrs Ayres works as a cook at the    
 weekends at a public house.
