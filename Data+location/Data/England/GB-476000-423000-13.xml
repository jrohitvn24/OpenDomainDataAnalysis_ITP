		<content> We were the first ones at the{church. 
 My brother was getting{confirmed. }   
 They had a piece of paper with their  
 names on because the{Bishop}would not 
 know their names.The {Bishop of       
{Doncaster}came to {confirm}the people 
 who were getting confirmed.There were 
 14 people including my brother        
 Nigel.My Grandma came to the          
 confirmation to see Nigel getting     
 confirmed.There were a lot of boys    
 there and girls.My Grandad could not  
 go to the{church}because he was not   
 very good at hearing.There was a newt 
 in the {church.}When I put the books  
 away I nearly trod on it.The first    
 hymn was 303,the second 157 and the   
 last song was 352.Afterwards we went  
 to {Hook Memorial Hall}to have some   
 biscuits, scones,tea and orangejuice  
 aswell.Nigel sat with the other boys.
