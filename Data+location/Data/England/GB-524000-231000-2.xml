		<content>    The town of Baldock has a          
 population of about 7000 (1984). It   
 forms part of a trio of North         
 Hertfordshire towns, Hitchin,         
 Letchworth, Baldock which forms an    
 almost continous strip of urbanisation
 on the A505.                          
    Baldock has a very limited         
 industrial base, there being a small  
 industrial estate on the A505. Most of
 the inhabitants work in the adjacent  
 towns and Stevenage. There is some    
 commuting by train to London.         
    The shopping patterns reflect the  
 competition from larger towns, and    
 many shop units are occupied by       
 specialist shops or by services. A    
 market is still held on Wednesdays, in
 the High Street but the cattle market 
 has closed. The annual fair is held on
 Oct 2nd and 3rd, which now consists of
 a funfair in the High Street.         </content>
