		<title>15THE STROUD WORKHOUSE</title>
		<content>{ Map Ref:-865052                      
   The Workhouse was built in 1837.It  
 covered 37,000 square feet.Although   
 workhouses were supposed to be        
 terrible places,the workhouse in      
 Bisley Old Road was one of the most up
 to date and modern workhouses.The old 
 people that were living there were    
 treated fairly well.It took a great   
 deal of money to keep all the         
 occupants fed for 1 year.             
   In the Second World War it was      
 declared unfit for human habitation   
 and was used by the British soldiers  
 until the Americans were billeted     
 there.After the Second World War it   
 was used by the Council as a County   
 Council Store.There is supposed       
 to be a ghost haunting the house,     
 footsteps have been heard but no one  
 was there.It is now being used as     
 flats.                                </content>
