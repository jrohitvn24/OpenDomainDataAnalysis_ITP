		<title>07A Home as a Guest House</title>
		<content> My house becomes a guest house for    
 four months of the year.It has six    
 bedrooms and we can cater for fifteen 
 paying guests at any one time.I help  
 in the summer by laying tables in the 
 dining room,serving meals,washing pots
 and making beds.The busy time is on a 
 Saturday morning when the old guests  
 leave and new ones arrive.All the     
 rooms have to be cleaned,the beds     
 changed and the laundry dealt with.Mum
 has also to organise the shopping for 
 the following week.I like the Summer  
 because I enjoy meeting new people and
 the atmosphere is always happy.       
  In the winter my house becomes my    
 home again.My family and I settle down
 to a more usual routine and prepare   
 for winter and the Christmas season.
