		<title>16HOUSING, RUGELEY</title>
		<content> The population of Rugeley in 1985 is  
 about 30,000. The old town centre is  
 less than half a mile across and now  
 houses few people. Most live in       
 estates built along the valley and on 
 the higher ground towards Cannock     
 Chase. Houses are not built on the    
 valley floor because of waterlogging  
 (the Trent was dredged to reduce      
 flooding). Most of the old terraced   
 houses in the town centre have been   
 demolished to provide car parks and   
 service areas behind the shops. Two   
 large estates (Pear Tree and Spring-  
 fields) were built in the 1950's      
 when the colliery and power stations  
 were opened. The large Etchinghill    
 housing estate was built in the 1960's
 and 1970's with the small Chadsfields 
 estate. In the 1980's new houses were 
 built at Albany Drive and in the town.
 Council houses were also refurbished. </content>
