		<title>01Summary of the Area</title>
		<content>Most of our area is in {Staffordshire} 
but a small part is in {Derbyshire}.The
River Dove forms the boundary between  
the two counties. There are two        
communities,{Mayfield in the South and 
Stanton in the West.} The land slopes  
from the River Dove at 100 m above sea 
level in the South to about 300m above 
sea level in the North. Mayfield's     
community grew in the Industrial       
Revolution because of the local mill.  
Stanton's population probabally grew as
a result of the mining there, which now
no longer takes place.{The largest part
of the area is farmland.} There are    
thirteen farms altogether, mainly      
dairy farms with sheep too. There are  
plenty of woods and streams in our     
territory and the scenery is lovely.Not
many tourists come however, they go to 
the popular area of {Dovedale} and to  
{Alton Towers} which are close by.     </content>
