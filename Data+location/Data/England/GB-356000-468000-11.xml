		<content>Mrs. Evans teaches music in our school 
on Wednesdays. She is a parent and a   
Governor of the school. Her family is  
about to move house but we won't be    
losing them because they are simply    
moving to a larger house in the village
as they are a family of six. The Evans 
family have lived in Hornby for almost 
15 years and would be very reluctant to
move away. The rural setting is ideal  
in which to bring up the children and  
the 20 km journey to work Prof. Evans  
makes is a small price to pay. They    
were impressed in the way they were    
made welcome when they first arrived in
Hornby; they believe this is still the 
case when new families arrive now.     
Tim Hepple was aware of this welcome   
when his family retired here a few     
years ago. At 17, Tim enjoys the area  
even if it is quiet at times! As the   
church organist he can be noisy!       </content>
