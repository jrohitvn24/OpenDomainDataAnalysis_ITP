		<title>10Cotton End Lower School</title>
		<content> This school has been in existence for 
 just over 100 years  and at present   
 there are 44 pupils on the school     
 role, aged between those rising 5 and 
 those who are 8 plus. Divided between 
 2 classes these children are taught by
 2 full time teachers, one of whom is  
 the headmistress and 2 part-time      
 teachers who supervise group work,    
 music etc. The present headmistress   
 took up her post in September 1984,   
 since when some major curriculum      
 changes have taken place. In addition 
 to new maths, reading and language    
 development schemes, primary          
 science has been introduced. Here the 
 children learn through such activities
 as seed dissection and understanding  
 and using batteries. Art, craft,      
 handicrafts, drama, cookery and       
 environmental studies are on the      
 timetable, with computer clubs.       </content>
