		<title>09LOCAL HOUSING</title>
		<content> This area is mainly woodland and heath
 land and is not very densely populated
 though the area is predominantly      
 residential.The housing is a mixture  
 of old and new the majority of which  
 are detached.Many of these are        
 individually styled and have large    
 gardens.4% of these houses have pools 
 and some have tennis courts.Modern    
 developments tend to be 'tudor'style  
 and 'non-estate' in character.Housing 
 is very expensive and many celebrities
 and professional people make their    
 homes here.The attractions of the area
 include the proximity to Heathrow,golf
 courses,Ascot race course,Windsor Park
 and London.The area is well served by 
 major roads(A30)and motorways(M3,M4,M2
 5)so it is popular with commuters.
