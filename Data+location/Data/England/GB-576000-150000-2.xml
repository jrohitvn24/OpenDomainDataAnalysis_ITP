		<title>02FARMING IN THE AREA</title>
		<content> There is much farmland south of       
 Maidstone. Barley seems to be the     
 major corn crop, but there are also   
 many orchards, most of which have had 
 their big old trees uprooted and been 
 replanted with the closer-spaced and  
 more dwarf species.                   
 Many of the sheep are varieties of the
 Romney Marsh breed, but Home Farm has 
 Border Leicester x Grey Face, bred, we
 were told, for both their meat and    
 their wool; the lambs not required are
 sold at 3 months old.                 
 Coppicing takes place in a number of  
 Sweet Chestnut plantations in the     
 area. The trees are allowed to grow   
 for 15 years or so and are then cut   
 down and made into spile-fencing and  
 hop-poles etc. They then grow again on
 their remaining stumps for another 15 
 years.                                
                                       </content>
