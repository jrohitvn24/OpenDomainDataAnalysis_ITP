		<content> The owner of Lower West Pitton many   
 years ago was a rather eccentric lady.
 She dressed all in black, a long gown,
 small  bonnet and high-buttoned       
 shoes: of a very frail appearance,    
 with a small face and very hooked     
 nose, she bent over her walking stick.
 It is said that the little old lady in
 black has been seen on a couple of    
 occasions, taking a great interest in 
 all the changes. Since her death the  
 property has acquired new owners and a
 new name. Now known as "Spinneybrook",
 it has undergone considerable         
 renovation and updating, but it still 
 has on either side of the front window
 a heart and a diamond worked in       
 plaster to mark the fact that the     
 property once changed hands on a game 
 of cards.                             
                                       
                                       </content>
