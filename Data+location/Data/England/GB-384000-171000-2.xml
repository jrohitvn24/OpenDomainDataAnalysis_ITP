		<content>      The area lies at the southern end
 of the Cotswold Hills. These hills are
 made of alternate strata of clay and  
 limestone,some rubbly,some the fine   
 Bath stone.                           
      Most of the land is fairly level,
 the highest point being at 450ft at   
 the west,the land gently falling to   
 325ft at the east. This land is       
 farmed, the fields enclosed by hedges 
 or stone walls. A small wooded hill   
 lies NE of Biddestone.                
      Running N-S down the western edge
 of the area, the plateau is cut by the
 steep sided valley of the Bybrook. The
 slopes are wooded, with pasture in the
 bottom of the valley (150 ft).        
      To the SE lies Corsham Park, the 
 grounds of Corsham Court, landscaped  
 by Capability Brown in C18. An avenue 
 of elm trees was destroyed by Dutch   
 Elm disease in recent years.          </content>
