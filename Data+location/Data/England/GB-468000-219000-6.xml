Every year in the middle of July we    
hold a Garden Fete. Each year we hold  
it at a different place. This year it  
was in the back garden of the Manor.The
garden is really huge.                 
     We have a mixture of different    
stalls.The most popular stalls this    
year were the tombola and the stall    
when you had to hit the golf ball into 
a hole.If you did,you won a pound.     
     Each year we have a Best Dressed  
Teddy Bear competition for             
children.This year a teddy butcher and 
a teddy witch won it.                  
     There was a display by the local  
dancing group.It is very soon splitting
up,and so people will be going to other
dancing schools.                       
     The fete started at two thirty in 
the afternoon, and ended, really, when 
everyone went home.                    </content>
