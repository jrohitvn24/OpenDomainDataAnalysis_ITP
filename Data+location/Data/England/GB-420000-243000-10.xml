		<title>10EDUCATION IN ILMINGTON</title>
		<content> The local{village school}has 72 pupils
 three full-time teachers including the
 headmaster.Children start school in   
 the September before the reach their{ 
{fifth}birthday, and they remain at    
 school for seven years until they are{
{eleven}years old.                     
 As unemployment has increased and more
 students chase fewer and fewer places 
 in higher education, parents have     
 placed much more emphasis on the{11+  
{selection procedure by exam}which is  
 operated at Ilmington School.A verbal 
 reasoning test is used together with  
 the{11+}exam to determine the         
 secondary school appropriate to each  
 child.On average, 12% of all children 
 are selected to attend the two        
 Stratford Grammar Schools.The majority
 of children from Ilmington attend     
 Shipston High School.
