		<content>   IN MY SPARE TIME I WATCH TELEVISION.
 SOMETIMES I PLAY WITH MY FRIEND AT    
 RACING ROUND THE BLOCK ON MY BICYCLE. 
 I RARELY GO TO THE PARK DOWN THE ROAD 
 BECAUSE I'M NOT ALLOWED ON MY OWN.  ON
 SATURDAYS I GO TO ANOTHER OF MY       
 FRIENDS HOUSES AND PLAY ON THE QUAY.  
 WE PLAY ON THE SWINGS AND SLIDES.     
 WHEN THE TIDE IS LOW WE PLAY IN THE   
 MUD OF THE QUAY THEN WE BUY SWEETS AND
 FIZZY DRINKS.                         
   I GO SAILING SOMETIMES BUT IT TAKES 
 A LONG TIME SETTING UP THE BOAT.      
 QUITE OFTEN I PLAY FOOTBALL IN THE    
 GARDEN.  ON MONDAYS AFTER SCHOOL I GO 
 SWIMMING.  I CAN SWIM 1500 METRES.    
   MY HOBBY IS DRIVING MY              
 RADIO-CONTROLLED BUGGY.  IT GOES 20   
 MPH.  I DRIVE IT IN THE CAR PARK UP MY
 ROAD.                                 
                                       
                                       </content>
