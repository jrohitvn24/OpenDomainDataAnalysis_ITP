		<content> After school Mrs. Boston and her      
 friends often went down to the stream 
 to play "pooh sticks".                
 Then at the age of seven the children 
 went to the "big school" which was    
 built in 1877. At the side of the     
 school was a house built for the      
 headmaster. The building is still     
 standing today although in a poor     
 state of repair and has not been used 
 for some time.                        
 The main change that Mrs. Boston has  
 seen in the village is all the house  
 building which has taken place in the 
 past twenty years.
