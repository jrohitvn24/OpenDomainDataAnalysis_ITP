		<content> Every year we have a June fayre at    
 school.This year we had stalls selling
 sweets,pizzas,cakes,plants,jumble and 
 toys.There were also games,which were 
 treasure hunt,hoopla,skittles,marbles 
 into a flower pot,lucky dip,throwing  
 wet sponges at men in a pillory and a 
 putting game.The money we raised was  
 for the school swimming pool and the  
 school fund.Bugs Bunny opened the     
 fayre at 3:00pm.He threw sweets for   
 the children.The Kingsbury Episcopi   
 band played music of different kinds  
 throughout the afternoon.There was    
 also an exhibition of toys in one of  
 the school classrooms.This included a 
 collection of 52 teddy bears and some 
 were very old.They were all owned by  
 the same family.There was a railway   
 set which took about 12 hours to set  
 up.
