		<title>16Shopping in Kettering N.E.</title>
		<content>  Grange shopping precinct has a sub-  
Post Office and it is possible to      
purchase groceries,vegetables, meat,   
flowers and newspapers at the various  
shops. A hair-dressing salon, a        
launderette and a fish and chip shop   
are well used.                         
  Of the 54 people interviewed just    
56% live on Grange estate showing that 
the shops are well used by people from 
Avondale estate too. 76% use the shops 
three times or more each week, 6%      
twice, 20% once. Each week 46% go to   
town once, 46% more, 8% never.         
  Some Weekley residents may drive or  
walk to Grange shops or town or use    
their own Post Office and general      
store.  Older folks go into the shop   
each day in order to talk with someone.
About half of the trade is casual as a 
result of people passing through the   
village and there being easy parking.  </content>
