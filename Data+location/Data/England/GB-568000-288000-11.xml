		<title>11FELTWELL SINCE WORLD WAR TWO</title>
		<content>   Feltwell is a large village and     
 would have remained totally rural had 
 it not been for its connection with   
 aviation, beginning in 1917.          
   In World War Two the R.A.F. had     
 Lancasters and Wellingtons stationed  
 here. This brought many airmen to the 
 village. Many of the people stayed,   
 that meant more children and a new    
 school was built.                     
   Old residents told us that some of  
 the old shops, such as shoemaker,     
 baker, basketmaker and blacksmith had 
 long since disappeared from Feltwell. 
 The old public houses such as the Cock
 Inn, Crown and Bell have gone; the    
 picture house 'Crazy Horse' is now a  
 storage building.                     
   New estates such as Oakfields, Manor
 Park and St. Nicholas have been built 
 in the 1970s and brought in people    
 from far and wide.                    </content>
