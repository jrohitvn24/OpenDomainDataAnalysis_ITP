		<title>10Sunnybank - A Voysey House</title>
		<content>Sunnybank is a traditional Voysey House
built in 1903 and originally called    
Hollybank. Voysey was an architect of  
the late Victorian age. In his life he 
designed many houses. Sunnybank was    
built next to Voysey's own house       
because a doctor bought the land. He   
not only designed the house but also   
all the doors,fireplaces,windows and   
all the iron work. It has a garden and 
a beautiful orchard of three quarters  
of an acre. Sunnybank was originally   
built for a doctor so the ground floor 
has a few rooms which were used. One   
as a surgery, one as a pharmacy and    
one as a waiting room. There are only  
50 Voysey houses remaining in Britian  
so Chorleywood is lucky to have two    
fine examples. Sunnybank is located in 
Shire Lane a lane that goes up the     
hill from the village shops.
