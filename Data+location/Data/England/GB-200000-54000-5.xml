		<title>05CHINA CLAY: CHANGES</title>
		<content> The china clay industry has changed   
 dramatically since it started in 1748.
 It has become fully automated and     
 highly technical. Whereas in the past 
 the Cornish quarry worker had to use  
 picks and long-handled shovels to get 
 at the clay-bearing rock, now he uses 
 high powered water jets capable of    
 exerting pressures of 300 pounds per  
 square inch.                          
                                       
 Traditionally, until the 1950's, pit  
 ponies carried clay in carts to the   
 ports. today, the clay is piped as    
 slurry or carried by large lorries.   
                                       
 Most workers think that things have   
 tended to change for the better,      
 making the job safer and less arduous.
 However, some things remain the same, 
 like the traditional cup of tea and   
 snack in the "crib" hut.              </content>
