 Walkden shopping precinct was built in
 1964 to provide shopping facilities to
 deal with the growing population      
 following the building of the         
 "overspill" estates.The site was      
 originally occupied by mills and a    
 colliery sales yard.One of the mills  
 was owned by the Labernon Spinning    
 Company.All the original shops were   
 located on Bolton Road.               
 Beneath the precinct there are two    
 canals which used to carry coal from  
 the Plodder Lane coal mine down to    
 Worsley and the Bridgewater canal.The 
 newest shops on the precinct are      
 mainly selling fashion clothes and    
 shoes.People mainly travel from       
 Walkden to shop but some come from    
 Farnworth, Boothstown and Tyldsley,   
 most shopping two or three times a    
 week. By J.M;R.B;J.S;K.B;G.R;N.W.     </content>
