		<content> There have been Parish Council,County 
 Council,General &amp; European elections. 
 The Parish Reading Room is used as the
 Polling Station.It is also used for   
 monthly Parish Council meetings and,  
 on alternate years, for the annual    
 general meeting of the local Conserv- 
 ative Association.At election times,  
 one resident allows the Conservative  
 Association to use his front room as a
 Committee Room,so that each person who
 votes can be marked off on the elect- 
 oral roll.Towards the end of the day  
 members of the Association can then   
 remind anyone who has so far failed to
 vote,to do so if they wish.During the 
 weeks before an election,candidates   
 send leaflets to each house,and some  
 visit in person.
