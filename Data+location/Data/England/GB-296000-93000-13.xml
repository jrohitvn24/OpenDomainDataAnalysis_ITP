		<title>13MY FAMILY</title>
		<content> My Family is very important to me.    
 When one of us is ill and has to go   
 into hospital we all have to help each
 other and manage as best we can.We try
 to get along to help each other and we
 have lots of arguments so mum and dad 
 sort us out.We try to keep mum calm so
 when she's watching her favourite T.V 
 programme we all keep quiet so she's  
 in peace.We go on holiday together.   
 When we are on holiday I feel very    
 happy because all the family is near  
 me and everyone is happy.When my dad  
 is away because of his work I feel    
 that he has got lost and I worry      
 about him.When he is home I feel very 
 happy.When it's dinner time on a      
 Sunday we sit down and eat our meal   
 altogether and we have a good family  
 talk.
