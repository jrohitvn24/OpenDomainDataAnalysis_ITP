		<title>03FIRST HOLY COMMUNION DAY (1)</title>
		<content> On  Sunday, 26th May, 1985 Classes 4,5
 and 6 were confirmed by Bishop Wheeler
 of  the  Leeds Diocese at  Holy Spirit
 R.C. Church.  There were  about eighty
 children   confirmed.   We   had   our
 photographs taken by the  Heckmondwike
 Reporter and  the Heckmondwike Herald.
 The church was full.  Some  chairs had
 to be put out and there were  a lot of
 people  at the  back of the church and
 the  choir  loft was  packed out. Some
 people  had to  park  their  cars down
 High Street.                          
 I woke  up at 6.45 a.m.  I had my rice
 crispies and toast for breakfast. Then
 my Mum  gave me a box of chocolates, a
 bookmarker  and a statue of the Sacred
 Heart.  Then I watched  'Are You Awake
 Yet?' -a childrens programme on I.T.V.
 I  got ready.  My Mum ironed my tie. I
 washed and then I got dressed.
