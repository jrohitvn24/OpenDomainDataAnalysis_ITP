 4.00p.m.At other times I have meetings
 which may go on until 6.00p.m.        
 Sometimes I have meetings after this  
 which go on until 10.00p.m.In that    
 time I have to deal with over 6,000   
 people any of whom may visit me.I     
 don't enjoy having to tell people that
 what they have done or proposing to do
 is wrong or would make life difficult 
 or unpleasant for other people.For my 
 job you need to have been to          
 university and taken a degree.Then you
 need to have been on a teacher        
 training course and to have wide      
 experience of teaching.In this school 
 there are 1600 pupils and 94 staff.The
 school caters for children from their 
 1st.to 7th years in Secondary         
 Education.The exam pass rate is very  
 good and we send pupils to Oxford and 
 Cambridge Universities'               </content>
