		<title>11LIFESTYLES IN/ROUND CHAGFORD</title>
		<content> The general impression is one of      
 relaxed affluence, with no signs of   
 genuine poverty.  People are able to  
 follow a number of pursuits mentioned 
 elsewhere, including{Twinning.} Chag_ 
 ford is twinned with{Bretteville_sur_ 
{Laize, Calvados, France}and this gives
 various opportunities for exchanges of
 visitors.  Each May{children and par_ 
{ents from Chagford School}go by coach 
 and stay at the local school, and then
 a few weeks later the French visit our
 school.{ Adolescents}also exchange    
 visits, staying with local families,  
 as do the{adults.}This year's visits  
 celebrate the 10th anniversary of the 
 signing of the{Twinning Charter. }When
 in Bretteville, we are able to visit  
 such places as{Arromanches (Normandy  
{War Museum), Bayeux, Caen and Paris.} 
 We are conveniently placed to cross   
 the Channel from Weymouth to Cherbourg</content>
