  STUBBORNNESS IS THE PROBLEM I HAD TO 
 OVERCOME WITH EBONY, WHO IS ABOUT THE 
 NAUGHTIEST PONY WHO EVER SET FOOT IN  
 ENGLAND. I USED TO HAVE TO BE ONE STEP
 AHEAD OF HER ALL THE TIME, BUT WITH   
 PATIENCE, FIRMNESS AND CONFIDENCE, I  
 MANAGED.NOW SHE IS AS GOOD AS GOLD AND
 IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURES 
 OF MY HOME LIFE.                      
  DURING SCHOOL TIME IT IS DIFFICULT TO
 HAVE A GOOD LONG RIDE AS I LEAVE FOR  
 SCHOOL AT 8AM AND GET BACK HOME AT    
 5PM., SO I JUST GO FOR A I5-2O MINUTE 
 RIDE TO KEEP HER TICKING OVER, AND    
 HAVE A I-2 HOUR RIDE AT THE WEEKENDS. 
 AS YOU MIGHT HAVE GATHERED, OWNING A  
 HORSE OR PONY IS A LUXURY AND SHOULD  
 BE GIVEN ONLY TO THOSE WHO DESERVE IT,
 AND WHO LOOK AFTER THEIR MOUNT.
