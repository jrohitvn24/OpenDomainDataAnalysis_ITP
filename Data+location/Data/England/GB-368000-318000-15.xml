		<title>15TIBBERTON VILLAGERS</title>
		<content>   In our area over 40 houses have been
 built in the last 10 years, mainly in 
 2 estates. Many copy the Sutherland   
 type built by the Duke's estate. Many 
 commuters move house frequently and   
 village atmosphere tends to be lost.  
   In{14}families interviewed only 2   
 sons work in farming. Others work at  
 Tibberton, Newport, Wolverhampton and 
 Telford. 6 are retired. 7 wives have  
 jobs. Most shop in Tibberton, and     
 Newport, a few in Wolverhampton and   
 Shrewsbury. Car ownership ranged from 
 1 to 5 per family. 2 retired people   
 had none. 3 families had holidays in  
 the UK last year, 3 abroad, including 
 Australia. Cooking is by electricity  
 or calor gas as there is no gas       
 supply. All have televisions and      
 washing machines. 3 have video        
 recorders and 2 have microwave ovens.
