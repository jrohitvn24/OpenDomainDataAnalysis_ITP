		<title>02CHRIST CHURCH FAIRWARP</title>
		<content> The church at Fairwarp on Ashdown     
 Forest was built in 1881 as a chapel. 
 It was built of sandstone and the     
 tower and sanctuary were added by Sir 
 Bernard Eckstein in memory of his     
 father in 1935. He  also added the    
 eight bells in 1947 and the clock in  
 memory of his mother and sister.      
 The font where babies are christened  
 is 100 years old and the bible is     
 fourteen years old. The lectern is a  
 revolving one.                        
 There are over 132 hassocks           
 embroidered by the people who go to   
 the church.                           
 In June 1985 the church had a Flower  
 Festival for the Golden Jubilee. I    
 visited the church with my mummy and  
 sister. There was an art exhibition,  
 bell ringing, a concert and services. 
 In the churchyard there are Scots     
 pine growing and a kissing gate.      </content>
