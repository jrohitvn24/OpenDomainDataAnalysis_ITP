		<title>12First Impressions</title>
		<content>    "My first impressions of the school
 buildings was not very favourable. The
 paint was peeling,wood was rotting and
 parts of the roof needed repairing.The
 newspaper store looked very untidy.   
    The uniform was a bit of a shock   
 because we didn't have one in the     
 schools in which I have previously    
 taught.Later though I realised how    
 much more presentable a uniform       
 looked.                               
    I was very impressed in the way the
 children made me welcome.They were    
 very polite and their work is of a    
 very high standard.                   
    I have tried to make the school a  
 lot brighter and cleaner and the      
 lessons will be changed.There will be 
 more science,C.D.T. and much more use 
 of the computers.                     
   It was not hard to settle down but I
 still found it different and strange."</content>
