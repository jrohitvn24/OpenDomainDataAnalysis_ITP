		<content> There are no{dance halls or dancing   
{facilities}in the area. Anyone        
 interested in this activity travels to
 Gloucester or Stroud depending on     
 which side of the River they live     
 on. Locally, Westbury on Severn may   
 provide an occasional Farmer's Dance  
 and the same occurs at Whitminster on 
 the south side. Also on the south     
 side, the younger generation need to  
 visit Arlingham (not in this block)   
 for a weekly{Youth Club}.Many school  
 children like riding their bicycles in
 the country lanes. Although the River 
 Severn is near, it is unsuitable for  
 fishing being too deep and wide.      
 Adults entertain themselves by        
 visiting{pubs or staying at home      
 watching{television}. It would seem   
 that for entertainment people have to 
 go outside the area.
