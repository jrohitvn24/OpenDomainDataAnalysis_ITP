		<title>05RECLAIMING LAND AT GRASSMOOR</title>
		<content> Grassmoor and Williamthorpe Colliery  
 tips grew for over a hundred years    
 into ugly mountains of waste. Now     
 these unsightly scars are being       
 removed.                              
 The out-cropping of coal is almost    
 completed; over one million tonnes    
 have been removed from the site north 
 of Grassmoor.                         
 The reclamation was started in 1975   
 and should be finished by 1987. Then  
 most of the land will be returned to  
 agriculture. Some, however, will be   
 used to create recreational facilities
 including parkland and a golf course. 
 Land already reclaimed is being fenced
 and grassed. Lakes and ponds have been
 left to add beauty and give provision 
 for fishing. Footpaths have been      
 restored and the area is gaining a    
 more natural appearance.
