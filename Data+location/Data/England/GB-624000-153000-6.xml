		<content> We are active in village life, we do  
 not all live in Goodnestone. One mem_ 
 ber is from Aylesham, one from Staple 
 and eight from Chillenden. One of us  
 is a School Governor and one a Parish 
 Councillor. Five are on the parochial 
 council and several on the Village    
 Hall Committees of Goodnestone and Ch_
 illenden. Members help with cleaning  
 and flower arranging in the church.   
 Meals on wheels are delivered in Ayl_ 
 esham by members. Others help organise
 the Fete held at Goodnestone Park. We 
 collect prescriptions and medicines   
 for the elderly.  One organises and   
 raises money for the pensioners dinner
 at Christmas. Five belong to the Moth_
 ers Union. Two raise money for the    
 League of Friends of Canterbury       
 Hospital.
