   Ash is lucky in the variety of      
 activities available to children,     
 locally and within easy reach of the  
 area.                                 
   The Scout Movement is represented   
 at all age levels by Beavers, Cubs,   
 Brownies, Guides, Scouts and Venture  
 Scouts.                               
   Dancing lessons include not only    
 Ballet and tap ,but also country      
 dancing, disco and ballroom dancing.  
   Many children are interested in     
 sport and learn swimming, trampolin-  
 ing, riding, football and karate.     
   Sunday schools are attached to all  
 our local churches and St. Mary's     
 Church has a youth club.              
   There is also a club for 5-ll year  
 olds called the Cockleshell Club which
 uses the Methodist Church.
