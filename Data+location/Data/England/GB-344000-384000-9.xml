		<title>09Sports Centres in Halewood.</title>
		<content>    There are two sports centres in our
 area, one of which is purpose built   
 and one which uses part of a recently 
 closed school.                        
    Halewood Town Sports Centre was    
 purpose built in 1981 and has a staff 
 of eighteen. The activities are varied
 and include boxing, squash, badminton,
 five-a-side football, gymnastics,     
 volleyball, trampolining, weight      
 training, handball, netball and keep  
 fit sessions. As well as the sporting 
 activities there is a creche, family  
 room and a well stocked bar with      
 snacks.                               
    Bridgefield Forum was a secondary  
 school. The main atraction of this    
 centre is the large swimming pool     
 which is used for local galas as well 
 as for general public use. Sporting   
 activities are similar to those of the
 other sports centre.                  </content>
