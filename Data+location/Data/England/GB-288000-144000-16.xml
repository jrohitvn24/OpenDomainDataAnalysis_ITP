		<title>16THE HISTORY OF PORLOCK</title>
		<content>                                       
 In 1885 a skeleton of one of the      
{Beaker People}was dug up on Porlock   
 Hill suggesting a settlement as early 
 as the{Bronze Age.}The{Saxons}gave the
 town its{name}which means a 'locked   
 port'.Porlock Weir is not mentioned   
 until the 1400's and it is probable   
 that a harbour once existed on the    
 marshes.Originally settlers came to   
 Porlock because of fertile ground and 
 sheltered position.Porlock farmers    
 still win{international prizes}for    
 their barley.{Vikings}attacked Porlock
 in the 800's.In the 1st{Domesday Book 
 the town was divided into 2 manors,   
 Dovri and Portloc.The 2 were made one 
 parish in 1932.a main industry earlier
 this century was oak bark{tanning}of  
 leather.Porlock is famous for its     
 long,steep hill.The first car climbed 
 it in 1912;it wasn't tarred until 1928</content>
