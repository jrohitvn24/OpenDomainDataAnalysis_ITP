		<content>As in many other parts of the country, 
woods, hedges and ponds have been lost 
as a result of an increase in arable   
farming and especially of "prairie"    
farming, which involves very large     
fields.  However there are still many  
items of interest, a detailed account  
of which can be found in the ECOLOGICAL
SURVEY of Suffolk, conducted by Suffolk
County Council and the Suffolk Trust   
for Nature Conservation in 1984.       
        Interesting features include:- 
1.The headwaters of the River Gipping  
the river meanders through wet grazing 
meadows.                               
2.The moat around the historic         
Columbine Hall.                        
3.Stowupland Green had a variety of    
interesting plants, but frequent       
mowings stopped these from seeding.    
Lady's Smock has survived.(continued).
