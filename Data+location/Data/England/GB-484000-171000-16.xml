 This is a very muddy lane after any   
 rainfall. In parts it is over grown   
 with bushes and is only 1metre wide in
 places. The surrounding boundaries    
 consist of thick hedges, brambles and 
 trees. Rabbits are a common sight.Near
 the end of the footpath, it passes    
 through woodland although most of the 
 surrounding landuse is pasture. The   
 footpath passes the Hazelwood Sewage  
 farm.                                 
 (Billingbear Lane-Wicks Green)        
 The path's condition is generally     
 grassy skirting fields with cattle    
 grazing. There are a nummber of       
 styles. Path boundaries include wooden
 and wire fences,hedgerows and a       
 stream. Some of the surrounding fields
 contain wheat and barley. There are a 
 number of farmhouses en route.
