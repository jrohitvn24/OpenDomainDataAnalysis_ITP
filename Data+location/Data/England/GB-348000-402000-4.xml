		<content>   In the past the area relied on its  
natural resources for work - farming,  
coal and clay - as coal and clay have  
worked out and farming became more     
mechanised the area was very much in   
decline. The New Town brought a revival
in industry and hope for people.       
   The big firms, attracted by large   
grants and concessions, moved in taking
on 1000's of people to work in metal   
extrusion, textiles, electronics and   
rubber. These closed down very quickly 
after the grants ceased and at the     
start of the recession. These big empty
buildings are now used for storage.    
   The demise of these factories       
brought severe unemployment and people 
moving to other areas.                 
   The smaller firms, employing less   
than 200, have continued successfully  
both expanding and increasing in number
18 such industries exist in the area.  </content>
