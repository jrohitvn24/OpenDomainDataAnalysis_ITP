		<title>20Transport in Dean</title>
		<content> Many of the villagers have cars of    
 their own, though many use bicycles   
 and even horses around the villages   
 and to other villages.                
 A bus service operates 4 times a day  
 in both directions, but the last bus  
 leaves Bedford around 6pm. The service
 links St. Neots, Kimbolton,           
 Tilbrook,Lower and Upper Dean and     
 Bedford, costing Â£1 single for the    
 trip from Dean to Bedford and taking  
 about 45 minutes.                     
 There ate 2 school buses serving Dean.
 1 at 7.45am collects the older        
 children for Sharnbrook Upper School; 
 1 at 8.15am takes the younger children
 to either Eileen Wade School in Upper 
 Dean or Margaret Beaufort School in   
 Riseley. 1 bus brings all the children
 home at about 4.15pm.
