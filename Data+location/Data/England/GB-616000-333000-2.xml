		<title>02FARMING IN THE AREA</title>
		<content> Daniel wrote about his father's farm  
 where wheat and barley are the main   
 crops grown.These are drilled in      
 Spring  and Autumn and are harvested  
 in August or September.The crops are  
 fertilized in Spring for stronger     
 growth and to replace goodness.They   
 are sprayed with weed-killer to       
 prevent being smothered early stages. 
 This is done by one man and a tractor.
 Harvesting needs more men.The large   
 farms are mainly arable and the straw 
 is burnt.The smaller farms bale the   
 straw for use as animal bedding.Oil-  
 seedrape is grown for production of   
 margarine.It is sown in Autumn and    
 harvested the next September.Birds are
 pests with this particular crop and   
 are controlled by a man with his gun. 
 This new bright yellow crop is a      
 spectacular sight in the fields.
