		<content> A day in the life of Darren Curtis.   
                                       
 I woke up at about six o'clock in the 
 morning and looked to the end of my   
 bed to see my feet sticking up.I      
 jumped up nearly falling out of my    
 bed . Slowly I climbed out of my bed  
 then I got dressed and went           
 downstairs. I threw the dog outside   
 but it attaked me so I had to kick it 
 out.I filled the kettle and had a cup 
 of tea and a slice of toast.At 7:25   
 Popeye was on the television so I     
 jumped on the settee and watched it.At
 8 o'clock the rest of the family woke 
 up.Until half past 8 I sat on the     
 settee as the minutes ticked          
 by.Suddenly I noticed the time; it was
 quarter to nine.I dashed to get my    
 coat and shoes but in doing so I fell 
 over my mums feet and my face hit the 
 carpet hard.                          </content>
