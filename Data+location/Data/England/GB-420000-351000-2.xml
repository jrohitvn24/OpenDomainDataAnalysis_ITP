		<content> Bradbourne takes its name from a      
 nearby stream, which is called        
 "broad stream".  It is referred to in 
{the Domesday Book 1086.}              
 An{8th Century Saxon Cross}stands in  
 the churchyard.  It depicts a scene   
 from the Crucifixion.  The church of  
 All Saints dates from Saxon times and 
 there are examples of Saxon work in   
 the north wall.  The square tower is  
 of Norman construction and is over 800
 years old.  It has a door made of     
 moulded columns and wedge shaped arch 
 stones.                               
 Near the church stands{Bradbourne     
{Hall,}a greystone Elizabethan mansion 
 built on the site of a grange used by 
 the monks of DUNSTABLE PRIORY who once
 farmed the limestone hills of the     
 district.                             
 During the Middle Ages the lords of   
 the manor were the Bradbourne family. </content>
