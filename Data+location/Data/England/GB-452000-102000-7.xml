 Stubbington Lane.The farm is on the   
 site of the original Hammond's        
 Nurseries.                            
 The farm consists of a souvenir shop  
 and the greenhouses.The two long      
 greenhouses contain many varieties of 
 plants,finches,quails,butterflies and 
 moths.The finches eat aphids and      
 greenfly and the quails eat red       
 spiders, some of these insects cause  
 damage to the plants and the          
 butterflies.                          
 The farm was opened in 1984 by Bruce  
 Parker of South Today.                
 The farm is expensive to run and is   
 usually closed to the public in the   
 winter to save on heating costs.
