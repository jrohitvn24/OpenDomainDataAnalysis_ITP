		<title>10A DAY IN MY LIFE NEAR SETTLE</title>
		<content> I woke up at 7:00 and went down for my
 breakfast. I had some toast. Then I   
 went to the bus_stop with Andrew. The 
 bus came and we came to school. On the
 way,we saw a{steam locomotive}called{ 
{Lord Nelson}pulling some brown        
 coaches. At school, we had maths with 
 Miss Thompson until 10:10 and then we 
 had break until 10:25. Then we had    
 french with Miss Michelmore until     
 11:35, followed by an hour for dinner.
 We then had games with Mrs Askew until
 break at 1:50. At the end of break, at
 2:05, we had English with Mrs Wilson. 
 At 3:15 we went home on the buses. At 
 night, I had my tea and then went     
{haytiming,}which is fetching in the   
 grass for the cows in winter. I go to 
 bed when I get in from haytime which I
 only do one week in a year.
