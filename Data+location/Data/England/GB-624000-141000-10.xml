		<title>10CONSERVATION AND THE FARMER</title>
		<content>  During the late 197Os the people of  
 the area were involved in disputes    
 concerning land-use. As a result of   
 this the Alkham Valley Preservation   
 Society was established. A farmer, new
 to the valley, decided to clear       
 scrubland so that he could recultivate
 the higher slopes. Trees were felled  
 and hedges were grubbed out. The      
 Society managed to get a preservation 
 order on the trees but much damage had
 already been done. The results can be 
 seen in the valley today. The areas of
 high ground around Sladden Wood and   
 Oak Wood reveal soil erosion and the  
 effect of wind-blow and wind-snap on  
 exposed trees. The area proved        
 unsuitable for modern farming and the 
 majority of the population hope that  
 in due course the area will revert to 
 scrubland.                            
                                       </content>
