		<content> There was a plaque for all the Vicars 
 in the church. It dates from 1327 to  
 1951, a 624 year span. Outside in the 
 graveyard, we counted 990 graves. We  
 saw 24 graves for people who had been 
 cremated. We also saw a grave where   
 one side had nearly fallen off. We    
 also looked inside and there was      
 a small oak tree growing. The stone   
 church is about 1000 years old.       
 When the Domesday Book was written in 
 1086 there was already some kind of   
 church there.             {
