		<title>18PUBS IN THE SEISDON AREA</title>
		<content>   Four public houses are contained in 
this block.   All are popular with     
people from outside the area who come  
by car from Wolverhampton, Dudley and  
other places in the nearby Black       
Country as well as from further afield.
Local people patronize them too but    
their custom alone would not be        
sufficient.   All the public houses    
serve light bar meals and one has a    
popular restaurant too.                
   One landlord commented that this was
a very nice area to live and work in   
and that, although not rich, he made a 
reasonable living and enjoyed the      
variety of his customers.              
   A thriving restaurant situated on   
the main road is chiefly frequented by 
people driving out from nearby urban   
areas.
