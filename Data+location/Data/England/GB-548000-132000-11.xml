 Although this is largely a rural area 
 there are a number of small industries
 including a garage, a nursery, an     
 independent slaughterhouse and a      
 signmaker. Mr. Donald, father of Jamie
 (page 9), has been running his own    
 motor repair business for 14 years. In
 a normal week he will work on about 15
 cars, using just Â£2000 worth of       
 equipment.  He does not advertise and 
 works completely on his own. He works 
 on a small number of commercial       
 vehicles but has no company contracts.
 The most common repairs undertaken by 
 him are clutch and brake replacements.
