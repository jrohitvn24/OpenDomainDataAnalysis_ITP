		<content>Whipsnade Zoo. The country home of the 
London Zoologicl Society is sited at   
Whipsnade on the Dunstable Downs.The   
Zoo was started in 1931 and covers 600 
acres of land,80 acres of which are    
used by a local farmer.The Zoo employs 
36 keepers\groundsmen, whose job it is 
to feed the animals and maintain the   
fences and enclosures,as the animals in
this Zoo are mostly kept in large      
paddocks in a effort to  create more   
natural conditions for the animals.    
About 380,000 visitors a year come to  
the Zoo and they can also view the     
White Lion which is a giant picture of 
a lion 100 metres across cut into the  
chalkface of the Downs.At night the    
White Lion is lighted by 750 lamps and 
is a very impressive sight.
