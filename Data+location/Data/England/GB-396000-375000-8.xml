		<content>   A small secondary benefit of keeping
 sheep is the income derived from the  
 sale of their fleeces;but it is only a
{small}benefit.The sheep are sheared   
 each summer,and their fleeces wrapped 
 inside out and tied with the twisted  
 neck part,known as the 'bont'.In 1985,
 a fleece is worth only{40p}to the     
 farmer.                               
   An average hill farm consists of two
 hundred acres,ten per cent of which   
 will usually produce a hay crop,the   
 rest,wherever possible,is grazed.The  
 hay harvest is gathered slightly later
 here than elsewhere in Cheshire,      
 usually in July.It is insufficient to 
 maintain the winter flock,in fact most
 of the hay for the animals has to be  
 bought in.Working sheepdogs are a     
 common sight,helping the farmer to    
 gather in part or all of his flock    
 whenever necessary.                   </content>
