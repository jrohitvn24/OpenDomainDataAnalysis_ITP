		<title>04The By-Pass</title>
		<content> The by-pass was opened in summer 1984.
 The by-pass has made a great deal of  
 difference to the village.It takes    
 most of the heavy lorries and there   
 aren't so many accidents.It is much   
 easier to cross the road.Singleton    
 Road is now a "no through road" and is
 much quieter.But the under-passes are 
 full of rubbish and people ride bikes 
 and horses through them.They are      
 sometimes flooded because the pumps   
 break down.The by-pass has its        
 benefits and its drawbacks.
