		<title>02The Undercliff_Main features</title>
		<content> The Undercliff is a{unique}area for   
 two particular reasons:               
 1.Its geological formation as a       
 great terrace between the sea and     
 the inland cliff which shelters it    
 completely from the north and gives   
 rise to its mild climate, fertile     
 soil and remarkable wild life of all  
 kinds.                                
 2.For hundreds of years there was no  
 access to this terrace except at      
 either end(Blackgang and Luccombe)    
 or by the difficult cliff paths.      
 In consequence of this isolation the  
 population remained small,and man's   
 interference with the natural         
 conditions was necessarily limited.   
 Probably also the landslips to which  
 the area is prone discouraged         
 habitation.                           
 Niton Undercliff runs from Blackgang  
 to Binnel Point.                      </content>
