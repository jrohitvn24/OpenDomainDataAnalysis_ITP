		<title>03A Day in the Life of Julia</title>
		<content>   On Saturdays I get up at 9 o'clock. 
 First I have breakfast of weetabix and
 a cup of milk.  Then I wash myself and
 clean my teeth. I switch on the       
 television at 9.l5a.m.  Next I put    
 fresh water in the dog's bowl.  After-
 wards I unlock the door and let the   
 dog out.  Then I go inside and dress  
 in my old clothes.  I go outside and  
 play swing-tennis.  At 2 o'clock I    
 have dinner and a cup of tea. At half 
 past two I change and go shopping.  I 
 go to Grandma's. Auntie gives us some 
 pick'n mix sweets. Grandma gives us   
 sweets too. I say goodbye and we go   
 home.  I change back into my old      
 clothes to play. I go to bed at half  
 past nine.  I read a book before I    
 switch off the light.  Then I get back
 into bed and fall asleep.
