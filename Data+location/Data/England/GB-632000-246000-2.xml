		<content> This block contains a limited area for
 farming, the main crop grown being    
 sugar beet which is taken for proces- 
 sing to Ipswich Sugar Beet factory.   
 Some potatoes are grown;  these go    
 either to vegetable markets or to fro-
 zend food processors, others are for  
 consumption by the Prison Service at  
 Hollesley Bay Borstal Institution.    
 Turnips are grown for sheep feed, and 
 some wheat which is primarily for pig 
 feed, the remaining being sold for    
 malting at Ipswich, Newmarket and     
 Stowmarket.  The Prison Service have a
 herd of cows on land in the area, the 
 milk being used by the Borstal for    
 their own consumption.
