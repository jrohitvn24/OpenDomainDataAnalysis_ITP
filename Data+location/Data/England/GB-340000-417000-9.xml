 their homes and takes them to school  
 and collects them at home time. Some  
 come by car others walk. School       
 startsat 8.55am and finishes at

   During the winter the junior boys   
 play football against teams from other
 schools for the League and Tournament 
 Trophies. The girls play skittleball  
 in the same Leagues and Tournaments.  
 We play against the school that has   
 surveyed this Domesday block with us. 
 In summer we play rounders and take   
 part in inter school athletics        
 competitions and a swimming gala      
 against other schools. Every Thursday 
 we go to Tarleton Baths for swimming  
 lessons. After school two nights we   
 have a Gym club. Once a month we have 
 Film club At Christmas we do a Concert
