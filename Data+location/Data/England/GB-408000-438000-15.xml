		<content> The Bradford Daily Telegraph was the  
 first daily newspaper to be published 
 in Bradford in 1868, when it sold for 
 one halfpenny. It was amalgamated with
 the Yorkshire Evening Argus in 1926.  
 It is published by Bradford and       
 District Newspapers along with two    
 weekly papers, the Bradford Star and  
 the Target.                           
 The Telegraph and Argus Office in     
 Bingley has a staff of nine, including
 two reporters and a photographer. They
 are responsible for covering the news 
 in Bingley and surrounding villages.  
 The Target is delivered free to over  
 33 000 houses.                        
 In the edition of the Target, 16th    
 May, six pages were taken up with     
 reports of the disastrous fire at     
 Bradford City football ground where   
 55 people died and over 100 were      
 injured.                              </content>
