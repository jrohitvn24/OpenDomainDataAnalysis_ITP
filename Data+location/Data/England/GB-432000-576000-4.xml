		<title>04The Old Village</title>
		<content> The old village of Seaton Sluice was  
 based around the main attraction, the 
 Harbour which from the thirteenth     
 century until the late nineteenth     
 century was the hub of industry and   
 social life of the community. For a   
 period, The lord of the manor resided 
 here. Sir John Delaval lived for many 
 years at Seaton lodge, a fine old     
 house standing in the dene on the     
 North bank of the burn. The lodge was 
 built in 1670 by Thomas Harwood. Sir  
 Ralph Delaval purchased it in 1684. At
 one time a footbridge spanned the     
 river to enable Sir John to visit the 
 glass works.
