		<title>08A DAY IN THE LIFE OF part 1</title>
		<content> I woke up on Saturday morning ate     
 breakfast then went with Dad to take  
 Mum to work. Before returning I bought
 a camera in Boots for Â£15. When I got 
 home I decided to go for a walk around
 Lynsted with my brother to try my     
 camera. We live at Japonica Cottage,  
 Ludgate Lane &amp; I'm Anna Budd. First we
 walked up Ludgate Lane then took some 
 photographs of Four Acres, a big house
 with a bumpy drive up to it next to   
 some cornfields. We carried on then   
 turned left over a fence &amp; along a    
 gravelly track, next we climbed over  
 another fence &amp; through a cherry      
 orchard. We took some photos of the   
 sheep next to the orchard, &amp; climbed  
 over a stile to a road, crossing it &amp; 
 going along another one &amp; down a hill 
 past a cherry orchard &amp; a sheep field.
