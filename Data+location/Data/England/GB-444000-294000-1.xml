		<content>        Work undertaken in this study  
 has been a joint effort by the        
 children of{Barwell Junior School}and 
 students of{John Cleveland College.}  
        The younger children concerned 
 themselves with a detailed amenity    
 count which extended far beyond the   
 requirements of this survey.They also 
 included some creative work.          
        The older students from the    
 College devised a detailed            
 questionnaire which was presented to  
 36 people in the area. Comments on the
 resulting analysis are included under 
 the 'Survey' headings.                
        A detailed geographical study  
 was also produced.
