		<content> The country at present has many       
 unemployed but so far, our part of the
 S.E.has not been hit very hard.       
 Tenterden is a prosperous community.  
 Most families with children have a car
 and many get away for a short holiday 
 with their children. Those who can't, 
 go out for day trips by car or by     
 coach. Recently many more families are
 taking advantage of the Adventure type
 holidays, arranged for children on    
 their own. Parents here like to know  
 that they are well supervised. A      
 greater variety of holidays like this 
 are becoming available. The older     
 people too like to get away. They save
 up and hope to take two shorter       
 holidays in the year. One in the late 
 autumn and one in the summer,         
 preferably before August when the     
 children break up from school.
