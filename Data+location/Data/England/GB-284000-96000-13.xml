		<title>13TRAFFIC PROBLEM NEWTON ST.C.</title>
		<content>{ 50% of the people in our survey      
 mentioned the{heavy traffic on        
{the main road (A377) as the major     
{problem in our village.}The difficulty
 of crossing the road, especially for  
 old people and children,and the danger
 of accidents was pointed out.Recently 
{a traffic island near the Post Office,
 following{years of complaint}by       
 individuals,pressure groups and the   
 Parish Council, has{slightly eased the
 problem.The road has caused{a death   
 recently in the village.A man pushing 
 his cycle was killed by a passing     
 vehicle.                              
{ Articulated lorries and juggernauts  
 cause considerable vibration and      
 noise.Villagers think they travel far 
{too fast.                             
{ A bypass has been considered}in the  
 past,but no money has been set aside  
 or route agreed.                      </content>
