		<content> Although the town of Ross-on-Wye has  
 been split into two by the block all- 
 ocation, a small background history   
 was thought to be necessary.The Cel-  
 tic name of Ross means 'a promontory' 
 and alludes to the red sandstone cliff
 dominating the stretch of the Wye at  
 this spot.In Norman times it was a man
 or of the Bishops of Hereford,whose   
 palace occupied the site of the Royal 
 Hotel.In l284 the Parish Church of St.
 Mary the Virgin was founded. Celebra- 
 tions took place from Easter to Novem-
 ber l984 to commemorate the 'Ross 700 
 Festival'.The Market House was built  
 of local red sandstone in 1670 &amp; stan-
 ds on the site of the old Booth Hall. 
 It is still used as the market place  
 on Thursday &amp; Saturday.The Hereford,  
 Ross &amp; Gloucester Railway was opened  
 in l855 but closed in l964-the site is
 now developed as an industrial zone.  </content>
