		<title>04The Canal</title>
		<content>    After the boom years came the      
 decline with the coming of the        
 railways and then with the perfection 
 of better road building.              
    However, barges contined to take   
 timber to Chelmsford until quite      
 recently. Springfield Duke was the    
 name of the last horse to pull a barge
 to Chelmsford in the Sixties and the  
 last load was taken by diesel barge in
 1972.                                 
    Presently the canal is used mainly 
 for leisure and pleasure. A barge trip
 can be bought from the lock in Little 
 Baddow and the water is still used for
 rowing, canoeing and pleasure boating.
 The canal is also used by fishermen   
 and many people enjoy walking beside  
 the canal.                            
    It is an asset of the area and it  
 needs to be carefully cultivated so   
 that future generations can enjoy it. </content>
