 friends, consult the reference books  
 and read the newspapers and           
 periodicals. On the main roof is a    
 small structure which houses the old  
 fire bell, once used by Broadway's    
 horse-drawn fire engine. A total of   
 13,776 books are available including  
 457 reference books. There are also
