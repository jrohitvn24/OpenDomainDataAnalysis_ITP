		<content> Most people in our area do have cars  
 it seems. And it's clear that they    
 like Ford cars particularly as they   
 are by far the most popular. When     
 asked most people said they needed    
 their cars for transport, to get to   
 work or to go shopping. 50% of the    
 people said they also had motorbikes  
 or bicycles.                          
 A big let down in the services in our 
 area seems to be the bus service,     
 mainly because there aren't enough    
 buses at the right time. Between      
 Monday and Friday there are 5 bus     
 services running through the village, 
 with destinations such as Reading,    
 Windsor, Bracknell and Slough. The bus
 service begins at 6.37am and there 19 
 buses passing through the village     
 until 22.20, but on Sunday there are  
 only 6 buses. Several people would    
 like to see a taxi service.           </content>
