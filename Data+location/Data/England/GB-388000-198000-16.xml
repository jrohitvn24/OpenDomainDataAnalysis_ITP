		<title>16MY VISIT TO CHERINGTON LAKE</title>
		<content> When you go along the road beside the 
 lake, it seems as if it weren't (sic) 
 there because it is in a sort of      
 valley surrounded by trees of         
 different kinds.  When you get to the 
 lake, there is a rocky bank which is  
 different from the one on the other   
 side, which is a large grassy one.  In
 the middle of the lake there is a     
 small island with a few trees on it.  
 Sometimes there are swans and ducks on
 the lake.  One bit of the lake has got
 lots of reeds growing, which makes it 
 a sheltered area for the birds.  At   
 first the lake is quite shallow but it
 soon gets deeper.  There are lots of  
 fish in the lake, mostly trout.       
 Although the lake looks safe, it can  
 be dangerous because of the soft sand.
