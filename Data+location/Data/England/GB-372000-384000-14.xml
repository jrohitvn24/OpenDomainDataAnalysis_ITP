		<title>14PETS SURVEY</title>
		<content>    The majority of the children who   
 live in the block of Bowdon kept{fish,
 but we found that some children didn't
 have any{pets}at all. It is quite     
 obvious that children who lived       
 near,or on, main roads wouldn't have  
{cats}or{dogs}and other people kept    
 animals like gerbils and rabbits. Most
 people who kept animals mainly kept   
 more than one animal.                 
    The strangest{pet}we found in our  
 survey was a horse. While other people
 had more common{pets}like{dogs, cats  
 and rabbits. We realized that the     
 people who didn't have any{pets}at all
 would either not like them, or have   
 someone in their family who was       
 allergic to them.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
