		<content> The lady we interviewed Margaret said 
 that a lot more than the price of     
 houses had changed in the village     
 since she had first came there.The    
 Langton Arms pub had once held over   
 300 people but now it is much smaller 
 with a restaurant and a skittle       
 alley.This meant that the carpark and 
 roads were much busier and a lot of   
 people came to look around the village
 and drive through the ford especially 
 in summer.Most of the people in the   
 village now had cars and did their    
 shopping in Blandford.This meant that 
 the village shop and post office had  
 closed down and Margaret had to go    
 into Blandford to collect her pension 
 and do her shoping.She said that she  
 used to know nearly everyone in the   
 village but she doesnt know many now.
