		<title>14Wheatley Hill Church</title>
		<content>    The church was built in 1873 by    
 members of the{Church of England. }It 
 was built on land which was owned by  
 the{Wilkinson familly.}The church is  
 not dedicated to any particular saint 
 and is called {'All Saints'}church.   
    All Saints church has no tower and 
 no steeple so the symbol on a map is  
 just a black cross.                   
    The Vicar, Rev.Thomas Thubron      
 reports that the church is in a good  
 state of repair although the roof     
 needs slight attention.               
    The{chancel}was erected in{1900.   
  The{sanctuary}was built in{1952,}    
 an extension to the{South aisle}was   
 built in {1954,}and a new{Vestry}was  
 completed in {1958.}                  
    In all eight people work in the    
 church including the Vicar, organist, 
 church wardens and church council.
