		<content>   For the majority of Atherton's      
 inhabitants the income restricts the  
 choice of holiday.Only people with a  
 higher,steadier income can afford to  
 take holidays abroad.                 
   Weather permitting,day outings and  
 weekend breaks are popular all year   
 round.The main holidays are taken     
 during the summer months.             
   People travel from urban to rural   
 areas and seaside resorts such as     
{BLACKPOOL,MORECAMBE}and{SOUTHPORT}.   
   Areas of natural beauty such as     
{NATIONAL PARKS}an example of which    
 is the {LAKE DISTRICT},are very       
 popular with the general public.      
   For people travelling abroad,       
 countries in Europe are the most      
 appealing such as France,Spain and    
 Germany.One of the advantages of      
 travelling abroad is the more         
 desirable weather.                    </content>
