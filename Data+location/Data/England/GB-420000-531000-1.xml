		<content> Essentially rural in character, past  
 history is one associated with mining.
 Viewed from the highest vantage the   
 scene is a patchwork of small fields, 
 hedgerows, mixed woodland and small   
 villages. On the west boundary the R. 
 Wear runs northward from B/Auckland to
 Newfield, largely peaceful/picturesque
 it is at this latter point that we en-
 counter the only real industrial site 
 left. We shall look at how geology has
 had a marked affect on all this.      
 Communities more heterogeneous than of
 old often work outside the area. New_ 
 comers might not regret the demise of 
 coal-mining but they do worry about un
 employment. They are also concerned re
 shrinking services: transport, closing
 schools &amp; churches; the need for play 
 areas for children.                   
 Attitudes, however,are favourable, few
 would exchange this for urban living. </content>
