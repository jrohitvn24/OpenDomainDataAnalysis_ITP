		<title>11Farming in the Area</title>
		<content> The farming in North Luffenham and    
 Edith Weston is mixed. The nature of  
 the land in this area varies and this 
 determines the land use. Many farmers 
 prefer to use their poorer land for   
 sheep or rough grazing. The farmer    
 interviewed uses his land for growing 
 barley but he does have some grazing  
 for the bullocks he fattens for       
 market.Other village farmers utilize  
 their arable land for cereal,silage   
 and root crops. Our farmer works about
 100 acres and finds no need to employ 
 extra workers except at harvest       
 time.The spare time that he has       
 throughout the year is spent on farm  
 and machinery maintenance. To         
 supplement his income, he keeps hens  
 and grows fruit and vegetables.In this
 area the farmers live in the original 
 farm houses,some of which date back to
 the 15th Century.                     </content>
