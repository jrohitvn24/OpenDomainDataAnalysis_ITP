		<title>07VINE GROWING IN TANGLEY.</title>
		<content> Mr.James Page-Roberts has lived in    
 Tangley for six years and finds the   
 soil and chalky sub soil very good for
 growing vines which is why he chose to
 live there.Although his vineyard is   
 only thirteen paces by twenty five    
 paces in a good year he grows         
 sufficient grapes to produce three    
 hundred bottles of white wine .In     
 England the climate is very good for  
 vines but only for white grapes as    
 there is not enough sun to ripen the  
 red grapes.It was generally thought   
 that vines would not grow successfully
 at a height over 300 feet above sea   
 level,but Mr. Page-Roberts has shown  
 this to be false as he finds his      
 Muller-Thurgau vines grow well at over
 600 feet above sea level.
