		<title>18CHANGING TIMES: WALSALL WOOD</title>
		<content>    A group of 5th formers from The    
 Shire Oak School visited Streets      
 Corner Day Centre for the elderly.    
 They asked the old people about how   
 life has changed since their youth.   
   The general opinion was that today's
 generation were materially better off 
 and had greater educational           
 opportunities. People no longer had to
 enter the Workhouse, share clothes, go
 without holidays or leave school      
 before 14.                            
   However, not all changes were       
 regarded as improvements. The old     
 people suggested that neighbourliness 
 had declined, and that growing        
 violence and unemployment, as well as 
 increasing traffic, had made life less
 pleasant than formerly. Some also     
 commented unfavourably on the         
 masculine nature of today's women and 
 the threat to work posed by robots.   </content>
