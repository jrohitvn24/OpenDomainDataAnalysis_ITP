		<title>10THE PEBBLE MILL HOUSE</title>
		<content>                                       
  From January to April 1985 the B.B.C.
 in their programme, Pebble Mill at    
 One, featured the repair and          
 renovation of a pre-war, three        
 bedroomed semi-detached house .79,    
 Damson Lane was to be transformed into
 a luxury show house. The house was    
 purchased by a local estate agent for 
 Â£18,750, well below market price. The 
 house was in a poor state of repair   
 and the garden needed attention.      
   The agents financed the project and 
 the B.B.C. televised each stage of the
 work. When the work was completed the 
 house was put up for sale-Â£34,500. The
 public were allowed to look around the
 show house and many from all over the 
 midlands came. The house has been sold
 but has remained empty up to July     
 1985.
