		<content> Sports that go on around Ashover.     
 There are local cricket and football  
 teams in both Ashover and Kelstedge   
 and they play in leagues in and       
 around the North Derbyshire and South 
 Yorkshire area.There is a well-known  
 six-a-side football tounament that    
 takes place once a year on the Ashover
 village sports field,and teams come   
 from quite a wide area to take part   
 in it.The Ashover cricket team is run 
 by one of the villagers but many      
 of the players in these teams are     
 no longer from Ashover or Kelstedge.  
 The pitches in Ashover are near the   
 village hall and so many of the       
 local children play on the pitch when 
 the team isn't playing on it,and      
 it is also used by Ashover Primary    
 School for their games against        
 other schools.There is also a tennis  
 club used mainly by local villagers.  </content>
