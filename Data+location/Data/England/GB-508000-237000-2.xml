		<title>02RELIGIOUS LIFE IN CLOPHILL</title>
		<content> In former times{Clophill}had several  
 small nonconformist chapels, most of  
 which have now disappeared, but one is
 now used as an animal food shop. We   
 have a ruined{12th century}church     
 which in recent years has been well   
 known nationally as a site for{black  
{magic,}especially on{Hallowe'en;}but  
 this is no longer enacted. The site   
 has been made into a beautiful picnic 
 area.                                 
 The present day{Places of Worship}are 
{St.Mary's Church,}built in the reign  
 of Queen Victoria it incorporates a   
 Lychgate and oak carvings from the old
 church, and the{Methodist Chapel}on   
 the High Street which also holds a    
 Sunday School for children.           
  There is an interdenominational      
 Christian Fellowship Group and a      
 Meditation Group, both of which meet  
 monthly.                              </content>
