		<title>03EGLOSKERRY SCHOOL CONTINUED.</title>
		<content> In 1958 the school of 26 children was 
 still housed in the temporary two     
 roomed wooden  hut which had been  put
 up nearly 40 years before. Water for  
 wash basins and the servery was       
 supplied by a hand worked semi rotary 
 pump.Sanitation was of the bucket     
 type.In 1959 mains water was put in.  
 In 1960 a new school was built,a      
 prefabricated Terrapin hut with 2     
 large classrooms and a kitchen. The   
 playground was surfaced to make a     
 large hard play area(30m.by 20m).In   
 1964 the nearby school at Tresmeer    
 closed ,the children coming to        
 Egloskerry. In 1967 main drainage was 
 installed and an Elliot classroom was 
 erected.The present school looks very 
 much now as it did then with 50       
 children,2 teachers,and meals cooked  
 on the premises.
