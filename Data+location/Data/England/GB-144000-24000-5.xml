		<title>05Tom Bawcock's Eve(Mousehole)</title>
		<content>     About two hundred years ago, when 
{Mousehole}was purely a{fishing        
 village, a man called Tom Bawcock     
 lived there. That winter the weather  
 was very bad and no boat had been able
 to leave the harbour for weeks to go  
{fishing.}It was nearly Christmas and  
 the food was getting desperately      
 short, so Tom Bawcock went out{fishing
{even though}the weather was terrible. 
 It was the only boat that went out    
 that night. The saying goes that they 
 caught seven types of{fish}that night.
     This event is still celebrated in 
{Mousehole}on the 23rd December when   
 "Starry Gazy Pie" can be eaten at the 
 "Ship Inn". This pie is so named      
 because the{fish}heads appear above   
 the top crust of the pie, gazing at   
 the stars.                            
                                       
                                       </content>
