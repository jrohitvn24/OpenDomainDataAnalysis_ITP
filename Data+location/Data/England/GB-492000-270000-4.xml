		<content>    St. Peter's Church is the parish   
church of Irthlingborough and stands   
near the centre of the town. There has 
been a church here for many centuries. 
It was registered in the original      
Domesday Book as part of the Diocese   
of Peterborough.                       
    Back in the 14th century           
Irthlingborough manor was purchased    
from Sir Simon de Drayton by a certain 
John Pyel. He was a very rich merchant 
who had been Mayor of London. He set   
about restoring the church and turned  
it into a college, not for learning    
but for religious purposes. It         
continued until Henry VIII ordered the 
closure of all such religious          
establishments.
