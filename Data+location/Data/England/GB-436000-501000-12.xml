		<title>12EDUCATION WELBURY &amp; DEIGHTON</title>
		<content>  Junior School is 6 miles away in     
 Brompton,and after the age of         
 11 most children move on to the state 
 comprehensive system at               
 Northallerton,one mile past Brompton. 
 Children are collected by school bus  
 each morning from the villages and    
 outlying farms, and returned home     
 between 4-4.30 p.m.After completing   
 their secondary education at 16-18    
 years,many young people in the area go
 away to various parts of the country  
 to continue their education at college
 or university.Children under 5 are    
 taken each morning by their mothers to
 nursery at Brompton School.           
 In past times the Welbury children    
 attended a local school founded in    
 1858 by The Church of England, now    
 converted to a private home.Deighton  
 also had its own school,which is now  
 incorporated into a grain merchants.  </content>
