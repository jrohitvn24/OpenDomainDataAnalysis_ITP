		<content> With a disused railway line in the    
 south-east corner of the block the    
 only form of wheeled{COMMUNICATION}   
 from place to place is by road and    
 lane.The Chairman of Avening Parish   
 Council said that fifty years ago most
{ROADS}were unsurfaced but covered with
 a white stone instead, which became   
 muddy during wet weather.However, many
 unsurfaced lanes used only as         
 footpaths today were used by wheeled{ 
{TRANSPORT}in the past, when they would
 have been wider.Greenway Head, Avening
 was used by  pack horses to carry wool
 from the higher sheep grazing lands   
 around Tetbury to mills in Avening and
 Nailsworth.Most of the roads and lanes
 in the block are rather narrow, even  
 the B4014 from Nailsworth to Tetbury  
 is only 6.7 metres wide and yet it    
 takes heavy goods traffic, there being
 a haulage {INDUSTRY}in Avening.       </content>
