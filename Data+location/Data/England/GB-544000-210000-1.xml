 We live in the north east area of     
{Harlow,Essex.}The railway makes a     
 border between the housing area and   
 farmland. There are factories lining  
 each side of the railway. To the north
 we are bordered by farmland,on the    
 east by{Old Harlow},on the south by   
 housing, and on the west by housing   
 and farmland,with the railway in      
 between. In{Templefields}we have the  
 ruin of a Roman temple.{Old Harlow was
{a village before the New Town was     
{built for housing after the Second    
{World War.}Harlow has 2 sportcentres,a
 swimming pool and a hospital. The Town
 Park is famous for its original       
 layout. Although we live in a densely 
 populated area,everywhere you look    
 there is greenery and open space; we  
 can easily reach London,the coast and 
 the countryside.                      </content>
