		<title>02Community Centre in Ingleton</title>
		<content> Mrs Coulthurst put much of the money  
 towards the Centre. Mrs Coulthurst,   
 from Gargrave opened the Centre on the
 21st of September 1974.Ingleton paid  
 for most of the Centre, not the County
 Council. To hire the Centre to have a 
 disco would cost Â£25.00.Ingleton      
 Community Centre has a library with   
 photos of old Ingleton and old books  
 and drawings but the library isn't    
 used much.The Community Centre is used
 for all sorts of things like playgroup
 for the over 3s and toddlers for the  
 under 3s.There is a typewriting class 
 for people who want to learn how to   
 type,and there is a youth club for 10s
 and over and there is a computer club 
 for grown ups. There is a Scottish    
 Dancing class for juniors.There is a  
 painting class for the over 15s.The   
 centre is open daily from 10am to 5pm.
