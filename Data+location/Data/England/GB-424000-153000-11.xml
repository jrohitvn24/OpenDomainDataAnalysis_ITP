 A custom which has been kept up for   
 over a century is known as Bun and    
 Penny. The origination is unknown and 
 the earliest records are to be found  
 in th school log books. In the 1870's 
 the children were taken to Penny Hill 
 on December 21st to be presented with 
 sweets,buns or pennies. The           
 distribution was made by the          
 wealthier ladies of the village. In   
 return the children danced around the 
 tree on the green.                    
 During the 1920's Mrs. Bridgeman of   
 Court Farm took over the giving of    
 Buns and Pennies to the school        
 children and this custom has been     
 followed by Mr. and Mrs. P. Gordon the
 present occupants.Now the children go 
 to Court Farm on the last day of the  
 Christmas Term when they are presented
 with buns and newly minted pennies.   </content>
