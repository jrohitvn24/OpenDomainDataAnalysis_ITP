		<title>11Christ Church, Coatham</title>
		<content> The church was built in 1854 and was  
 paid for by Mrs Teresa Newcomen.      
 There are services held every day     
 apart from Thursday and Saturday. The 
 attendance on Sunday is good with 160 
 attending the 3 services. During the  
 rest of the week the attendance       
 varies from 4 to 10. Once a month     
 there are church parades for Scouts,  
 Cubs, Guides and Brownies.            
                                       
 The church spire was in recent danger 
 of collapsing. The cost of the repairs
 was Â£20,000 raised by donations. The  
 spire is an important landmark for the
 local fishermen.They line it up with  
 the Coatham Hotel to find the channel 
 into the shore and a good place for   
 fishing. There is a graveyard around  
 the church but it's now full and so   
 all burials take place in the cemetry 
 on the other side of Redcar.          </content>
