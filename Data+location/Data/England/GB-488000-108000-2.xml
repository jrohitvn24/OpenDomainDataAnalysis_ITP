 In Goodwood House there are many      
 fascinating family portraits. There   
 are paintings of London and Venice and
 three horse hunting at Goodwood.      
 There are many objects once owned by  
 famous people.  There is a plate that 
 Napoleon used at breakfast on the     
 morning of the Battle of Waterloo.    
 There is also Queen Victoria's walking
 stick and Bonny Prince Charlie's      
 travelling moneybox.                  
 Goodwood house was originally built as
 a hunting lodge in 1616.  In the long 
 hall there is a picture of the local  
 hunt (by Stubbs) and a picture showing
 the hunting lodge as it was in 1746   
 (by Wooten).  The house was bought by 
 the first Duke of Richmond in 1694 and
 has been the home of the Dukes since  
 then.                    By Rebecca G </content>
