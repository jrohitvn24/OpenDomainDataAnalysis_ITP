		<title>06HENFIELD PARISH COUNCIL.</title>
		<content>   The Chairperson of Henfield Parish  
 Council came to talk to us.  She told 
 us about her job. It is not easy      
 looking after Henfield because it is a
 big village.  In many places it would 
 be considered a small town.  The      
 Parish Council looks after the general
 care of the village.  On the Parish   
 Council are doctors, teachers,        
 professional people, the Vicar and    
 some housewives.  They are elected by 
 the people of Henfield who are over   
 18.  There are 11 meetings a year held
 once a month apart from August.  There
 are sub-committees who meet regularly.
 There is the Cemetery Committee, the  
 Museum Committee, the Lighting and    
 Open Spaces Committee, the Planners   
 Advisory Committee and the Finance and
 General Committee.  The Chairperson   
 said she spends about one day a week  
 working on Parish matters.            </content>
