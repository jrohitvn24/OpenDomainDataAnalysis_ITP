		<content> The main railway line from Liverpool  
 Street station to Cambridge runs      
 alongside the canal and was opened in 
 1848. Local trains from London to     
 Bishop's Stortford use overhead       
 electric power lines suspended from   
 gantries, but the express trains going
 beyond Bishop's Stortford are hauled  
 by type 47 diesel-electric locomo-    
 tives.                                
 The A414 has recently been re-numbered
 and as we write there are extensive   
 roadworks in progress at the          
 junction of the road up from Roydon   
 and the A 414 to divert the road round
 Stanstead Abbots in order to avoid the
 level-crossing at St Margaret's       
 station.                              
 Traffic counts were taken on Elizabeth
 Way and the A 414. The results are    
 shown on the following page.
