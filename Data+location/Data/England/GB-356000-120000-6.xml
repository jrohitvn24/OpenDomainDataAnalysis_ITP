 the Manor grounds or by the church    
 attended by most of the villagers.75% 
 of the profits are given to the church
 and the remaining 25% is sent to a    
 different charity each year. Local    
 school children give a demonstration  
 of Maypole and Country Dancing.There  
 are also the usual stalls and games.

 Harvest Supper is held in the village 
 hall.All the food given is auctioned  
 and the money raised is donated to a  
 charity.A village concert is held in  
 November and the Women's Institute and
 the British Legion perform a play.Any
