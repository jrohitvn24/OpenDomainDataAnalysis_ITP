		<title>02History of Shutford/Balscote</title>
		<content> The name Shutford is derived from     
 Scytta's Ford. In the fourteenth      
 century the village was quite large.  
 20 people were assessed for tax in    
 1327. In 1377 there were 86. A fire in
 1701 destroyed 24 houses. Some houses 
 were rebuilt and modernised. In 1774  
 71 houses were recorded. In the middle
 ages there were 3 manors in Shutford. 
 The manor house appears to have been  
 built in the 16th century. In the     
 Civil War, Viscount Saye and Sele     
 supported the Parliamentarians. Plush 
 and shag weaving was established in   
 1747 and became the villages main     
 claim to fame. The name Balscote is   
 derived from Baell's Cot, ie the      
 homestead of Baell.
