		<title>02Agriculture in Exbourne</title>
		<content> In the last twenty years farms have   
 become bigger.Lots of hedges and trees
 have been taken out.Farms have become 
 more industrialized.Cows and sheep are
 the most common farm animals.There are
 fewer cows now because of the Milk    
 Quotas.Most of the fields are seeded  
 pasture for grazing,silage or hay.Some
 corn is grown.Our survey showed that  
 nowadays only two or three people work
 on each farm,although the farms are   
 the same size or slightly larger.     
 Farms, which up to the second World   
 War employed up to a dozen men, are   
 now farmed by the owner, his wife and 
 usually a son or relation.            
  This area has been farmed since Saxon
 times.We think it will continue to be 
 farmed.The Common Market has affected 
 farming in this area and will change  
 it as the Policies alter and farmers  
 follow suit.                          </content>
