		<title>12New Orton transport</title>
		<content>   The estate was only started in 1972 
 so all the transport facilities are   
 new.                                  
   {Cars }Use the large Parkway road   
 which loops round the outside of the  
 area.  Smaller roads  link wach       
 neighbourhood.  Cars are kept         
 deliberately from driving through     
 neighbourhoods for safety.            
   {Buses }which run every 15 minutes  
 till 6 pm. and every hour after have  
 a special road which goes right       
 through each neighbourhood.  It costs 
 50 p. to ride into Peterborough.      
   {Cyclists }have a system of cycle   
 tracks which run alongside pavements  
 and serve all areas of the new        
 township.  When they cross a large    
 road they  go under it in a subway.   
 There is a cycleway that goes along   
 the river Nene, linking the Ortons to 
 the City Centre.                      </content>
