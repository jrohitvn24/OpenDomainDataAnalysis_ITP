		<title>13Recreation in Hartlepool</title>
		<content>      Leisure inb Hartlepool caters for
 people of all ages and all interests  
 except in the field of theatre and    
 cinema.                               
{1. Can I see a play?}  No, you could  
 not see a play performed in a theatre 
 by a professional company.  However   
 many local amateur groups put on      
 plays, musical comedies and light     
 operas in small theatres in the       
 colleges and on stages in schools and 
 the Town Hall.  Some small            
 professional touring companies bring  
 productions to the town using the same
 stages as the amateur societies.      
{2. Can I see a film?}  No, a cinema   
 does not exist.  However the film     
 society meets fortnightly in the      
 College of Art and shows a variety of 
 films.
