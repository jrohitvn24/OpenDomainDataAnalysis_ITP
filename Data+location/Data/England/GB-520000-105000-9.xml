		<title>09Fire station</title>
		<content> We surveyed square 2306 and found it  
 was partly residential but largely    
 farmland.The most interesting feature 
 of this area is the fire station. The 
 fireman told us they get about 10     
 calls a week,and 415 calls a year.It  
 was the first computerised station in 
 Britain.A fire engine can hold 400    
 gallons of water.The ladder is 14     
 metres triple extension.Some fires    
 cannot be put out by water.They use   
 foam made of pigs bones and cows      
 blood,or carbon dioxide.They had been 
 called to the Grand Hotel bombing.We  
 were allowed to go on the fire engine.
 It was quite big and can carry 5      
 people.The seats were very hard. He   
 also showed us the hats and coats they
 wear. By Tara.
