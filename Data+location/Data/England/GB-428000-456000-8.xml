		<title>08HOME LIFE IN KILLINGHALL</title>
		<content>   A survey showed that there were     
 approximately 250 houses in the       
 village and as there are 146 children 
 of school age the village is thriving 
 rather than declining. Although new   
 estates have brought in young people  
 (63 have lived in the village for less
 than ten years) many people have spent
 most of their lives in the same house.
 81 have live here for over 50 years.  
   Most houses are less than 40 years  
 old and two thirs are houses with most
 of the remainder bungalows. There are 
 only 16 cottage type dwellings.       
   Although there are enough shops to  
 supply the needs of the village our   
 survey showed only 33 families used   
 them solely, with another 40 doing all
 their shopping elsewhere, mainly the  
 supermarkets in Harrogate.
