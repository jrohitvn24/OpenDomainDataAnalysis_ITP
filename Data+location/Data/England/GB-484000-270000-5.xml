   On June 25th we conducted a traffic 
count in Orlingbury Road,Little        
Harrowden at 10.30 a.m. until 11.00a.m.
 The road was not a main road but does 
connect between two main roads.The     
results are as follows.                
 MOTORBIKES  2                         
                                       
 LORRIES    10                         
                                       
 VANS       18

THE TOTAL NUMBER OF VEHICLES =110      
  Most of the cars we saw were passing 
through the village probably travelling
between the main roads.We saw the      
mobile library van in the village.
