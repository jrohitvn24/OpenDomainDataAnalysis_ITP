		<content> There are{132}dwellings most of which 
 are detached and arranged in "ribbon  
 development" along the main roads. The
 majority of houses are pre 1940       
 although over a third of the total    
 have been built since 1940. 16        
 properties have been erected in the   
 last 10 years.Building materials for  
 walls vary from brick and flint,brick 
 and stone,mixtures of brick,factory   
 produced stone,rough cement to pebble 
 dash.There is also a wide range of    
 roofing materials with the majority   
 being tiles but thatch,slate and      
 cement tile are also being used.A few 
 dwellings remain "tied"to the         
 occupation.Some of the farms and farm 
 houses belong to the Holford Estate   
 whilst others belong to the council   
 and the rest are privately owned.
