		<content> The area has grown up around the      
 pit.{Frickley hospital}was opened by  
 the pit as a surgical unit in 1905.It 
 was used for treating mining          
 accidents and was maintained by a     
 miners' levy.It was a cottage hospital
 at first.It is called{Warde Aldam     
 after the local landowner who owned   
 most of the land in the area.It is now
 run by the Health Authority and is in 
 the process of becoming a{psychiatric 
 unit for a wider area,much to the     
 dismay of many local people.Once a    
 year a garden party is held in the    
 local grounds.There also used to be a 
 maternity hospital nearby but this is 
 now the{Frickley Colliery Officials   
{and Staff Social Club.}This is        
 nicknamed{"The Nudge and Whisper".}If 
 you were talking about an official you
 would get a nudge and a whisper.
