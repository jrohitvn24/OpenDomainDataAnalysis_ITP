		<content> Ideford is a nucleated village with a 
 present population of 308.It is       
 smaller in size than in 1801 when it  
 was an important farming community.Now
 it is mainly a village occupied by    
 people who commute to nearby centres  
 of employment such as Newton Abbot and
 Exeter.The village has experienced    
 some recent growth, with the building 
 of a small group of modern detached   
 and semi detached houses.These are at 
 the south east end.Older              
 buildings dating back 200-300 years   
 are found along the main street of the
 village and grouped around the        
 Church,while at the western end there 
 is a small area of postwar council    
 housing.The village supports a very   
 small range of shops probably because 
 of competition from nearby villages   
 like Chudleigh,and towns like Newton.
