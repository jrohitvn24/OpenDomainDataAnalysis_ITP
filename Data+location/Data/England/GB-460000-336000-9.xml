		<content>    The{Nottinghamshire County Council 
 owns the 270 acre site which is the   
{Holme Pierrepont Watersports Centre.  
 The old gravel workings were          
 transformed into the Centre which was 
 opened in 1973. If the 1992 Olympic   
 Games are held in Britain, the rowing 
 and canoeing events will take place at
 Holme Pierrepont.                     
    There is a large rectangular       
 stretch of water which is 2,125 metres
 long and 135 metres wide. There is    
 special equipment for starting races, 
 an electronic scoreboard and          
 electronic timing equipment. There is 
 a stand for spectators but people can 
 also sit on the grass along the side. 
    At the end of he course is a large 
 boathouse where the various craft used
 on the water can be kept. Local       
 organisations use the facilities which
 are also the venue for regattas.      </content>
