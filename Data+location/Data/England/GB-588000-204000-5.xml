		<title>05MUNDON FARMING PROBLEMS</title>
		<content>          THE SOIL                     
 Much of the farmland we surveyed was  
 not particularly fertile and a lot of 
 it was reclaimed Marshland.           
   Freshfields Farm was bought in      
 1953.It was almost a wilderness and an
 awful lot of work had to be done      
 before any profitable farming could be
 carried out.                          
   The land had to be drained and      
 infilled.Dykes were dug and they lead 
 to ditches which eventually drain into
 the Estuary.Then the land had to be   
 infilled and Maldon Council dumped a  
 lot of household rubbish there. Then a
 lot of topsoil had to be brought in   
 and the land enriched with mushroom   
 compost and other fertilizers. The    
 fields then had to be reorganized so  
 machinery could be used.This work is  
 now complete.
