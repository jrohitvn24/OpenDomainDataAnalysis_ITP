		<title>08Our work on the farm</title>
		<content> Our dads are glad of our help on the  
 farm.Martin shuts the cows into the   
 field,he scrapes the yard clean and   
 helps with the fencing.               
 David helps with the fencing,puts     
 sacks on a bonfire, sits in the cab   
 and watches the hydraulics and        
 fertiliser as his dad drives.         
 David W. sits in the cab and helps his
 dad with the pedal work, he sometimes 
 scrapes the cow shed.We get 50 p. a   
 job.                                  
 We like helping our Dads on the farm  
 and we want to work on a farm when we 
 grow up. The busiest time is harvest  
 when the corn is combined it is a very
 dusty time.
