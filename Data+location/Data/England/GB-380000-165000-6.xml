		<content> We went to interview Ian at Monkton   
 Stores _the{only shop}in our survey   
 area . He has been working at the shop
 for five years. Ian likes being his   
{own boss,}and making friends with     
 people that use his shop regularly.The
 shop is open on Mondays, Tuesdays,    
 Wednesday mornings, Thursdays, Fridays
 and Saturday mornings.In the days when
 the shop is closed he does paperwork  
 at home. There are always{two}people  
 in the shop:one to run the{post office
 and to serve{groceries.}There are two 
 part-time assistants.At one time there
 would be specially baked bread and    
 other locally- produced food for sale 
 but now convenience foods are popular 
 with customers.Almost all the         
 customers come from Monkton Farleigh, 
 Farleigh Rise or South Wraxall.They   
 like the personal service in a village
 shop.                                 </content>
