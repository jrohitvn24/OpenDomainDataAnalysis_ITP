{UPS AND DOWNS}: To  play this game you
 can  use the  netball pitches  because
 you  need two  circles  as home areas.
 One person is {IT}in the middle of the
 playing  area  and  the  rest  are  in
 either  of  the circles. These have to
 run from one  circle to the  other and
 are chased  by the  one in the middle.
 If you are  touched whilst outside the
 circle  then you  are{IT }as  well. If
 players  refuse  to  run, or  run only
 rarely, then the people who are{IT}can
 give  them  a  countdown  during which
 they  must  run, if  not they  are {IT
 automatically. The first person caught
 is{IT}to start the next game.
