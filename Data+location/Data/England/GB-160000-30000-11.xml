		<content> Cont'd.                               
 The Godolphin male line died out in   
 the 18th century and the property     
 passed via marriage to the Duke of    
 Leeds.  He never lived in Cornwall and
 took little interest in the estate.   
 In 1805 a large part of the house was 
 demolished leaving the remainder to   
 serve as a farmhouse and fall into    
 decay.                                
 In 1937 the house was bought by Mr.   
 and Mrs. Schofield who have preserved 
 and restored the property.  The house 
 boasts several ghost stories and is   
 open to visitors at certain times of  
 the year.
