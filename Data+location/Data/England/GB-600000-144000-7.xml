		<title>07 HOUSING IN KENNINGTON</title>
		<content> Most houses in Kennington are detached
 or semidetached (detached houses are  
 houses totally on their own.          
 Semidetached are joined to another    
 house on one side.) The oldest style  
 of houses still erect are Victorian.  
 Today, houses are being built more and
 more like the older types. In the last
 20 years, very many new houses have   
 been built. Many of these houses have 
 been built by the Ashford Borough     
 Council for families who have moved   
 from London to settle here. Some      
 houses are installing double glazing  
 and building extensions.{BRODADHURST  
{DRIVE}is the most recent estate. Old  
 people's homes have been built near   
 THE PASTURE and in{LOWER VICARAGE
