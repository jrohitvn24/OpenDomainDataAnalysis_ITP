		<title>07A Day in Grimsby, Part 1.</title>
		<content> A day in my life would be to get up at
{7.00}(my usual time) and get dressed. 
 Almost every day I sit and listen to  
 my mum, dad and family talking ( so   
 for today ). At about{7.20}I have my  
{breakfast}which consists of three     
 rounds of{toast,}a few{biscuits}and a 
 glass of{milk}or{orange.}I get my     
 school bag ready for school which     
 takes about{10 minutes.}By that time  
 it is{7.40,}and in another{5 minutes}I
 leave for school. On the way I pass my
 best friends house  but I don't call  
 for her as I have{prefect}duties to do
 and have to go in school straight     
 away. As I near the gate I always meet
 with another of my friends  and we    
 walk in school together. In school I  
 have a variety of things to do, first 
 I put the chairs down in the{dining   
{room,}then I set out the school       
                                       </content>
