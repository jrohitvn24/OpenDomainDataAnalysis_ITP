		<title>19NORHEADS FARM BIGGIN HILL</title>
		<content>There has been a farm at Norheads since
Norman times. The old spelling of the  
word was NORRADS.Agriculture on the    
western slopes of the valley has       
generally been dairy and cereal        
farming,the strawberry and raspberry   
growing on the CUDHAM side of the      
valley.The fine Queen Anne style       
residence built for John Clover about  
1715 indicates the prosperity of the   
farm and lifestyle of the gentleman    
farmer of that period.The Clover       
family are buried in Cudham            
churchyard.There are still the fire    
marks issued by the early insurance    
companies fixed to the outside of the  
house.The Norman family of Bromley     
Common owned the farm in the late      
1800's.
