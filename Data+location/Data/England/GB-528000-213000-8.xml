		<content>    The church of St.Michael and All   
 Angels was built to the order of      
 Robert Smith of Goldings  in 1871-2.  
 All the oak used in the construction  
 of the church was cut from trees      
 growing within the Goldings estate.   
 Constructed of Kentish Rag, cornered  
 with dressed Bath stone, the church is
 built in the style of Early English   
 Gothic.                               
   The stained glass windows are       
 particularly fine.  The most          
 noteworthy are those on the south wall
 by Sir Alfred Burne-Jones depicting   
 the prophetess Miriam &amp; King David.   
 The East window, consisting of three  
 lights with medallions above, is the  
 work of Burne-Jones, Dante-Gabriel    
 Rossetti and William Morris.
