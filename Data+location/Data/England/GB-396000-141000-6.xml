		<title>06HOUSING IN CHITTERNE</title>
		<content> There are several large houses,       
 notably Manor House, which is a Grade 
 II, Elizabethan building, and The Old 
 Vicarage, now a private dwelling.     
 Throughout the remainder of the area  
 there are only a few scattered        
 farmhouses and associated farmworkers'
 cottages.                             
 House prices are steadily increasing  
 and there are only a few properties on
 the market, including one or two      
 building plots. In the West Wiltshire 
 Rural District Policy Statement,      
 Chitterne qualifies for limited       
 residential development. The local    
 view is that small scale housing      
 should be encouraged and the Structure
 Plan for the area allows for infill   
 housing only.
