		<content> INTRODUCTION.                         
 This block is a rural area, it has a  
 lot of farms. There are about two     
 squares of residential area which is  
{Cheriton Fitzpaine}itself.Cheriton is 
 a lively village it has a friendly    
 atmosphere and lots of things         
 happen,like the carnival.The other    
 small residential areas are{Stockleigh
{English}and{East Village.}There isn't 
 much unemployment in the villages but 
 it is hard to get a job.Many people   
 work on farms but most of the employed
 work in Exeter,a few of them going to 
 Tiverton or Crediton.There are quite a
 lot  of builders here like the Martin 
 Bros.,the Whites and the partnership  
 between T.Harvey and B.Tucker.        
 Cheriton Fitzpaine has a village      
 store,a Post Office,a saddlers and a  
 blacksmith which is going to reopen   
 soon.                                 </content>
