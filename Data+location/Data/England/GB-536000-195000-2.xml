		<content> To the{west}of the reservoir,the      
 housing is a mixture of privately     
 owned and council property.There are  
 several blocks of{12 storey flats.}The
 houses are mainly{terraced or         
{semi-detached}and nearly all have     
 gardens.Much of the housing was built 
 between the two world wars.           
 Although there are good transport     
 links with London,many of the people  
 living in the area find employment    
 locally.                              
 To the{east}of the reservoir housing  
 is confined to the{Yardley council    
{estate}built at the end of the 1940's 
 and to strip development along the    
 Sewardstone Road.The village of       
 Sewardstonebury is largely composed of
 large detached residences close to    
 the local recreation facilities.
