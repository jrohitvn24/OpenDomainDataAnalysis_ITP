		<title>20BUILDINGS IN BURWELL AREA.</title>
		<content> Many of the oldest buildings such as  
{Hall Farm}in Swaffham Prior's North   
 Fen have{clunch (locally quarried     
{upper chalk)}and timber framed walls. 
 The{oldest house in Burwell,}on the   
 corner of Isaacson Rd, has walls made 
 of clunch and some later brick.It has 
 an attic and a cellar.It was probably 
 built in the 14th century .           
  Opposite it the{old Maltings}are now 
 being repaired and re-thatched by new 
 owners.                               
  The clunch was probably obtained from
 the pits behind Isaacson Rd.A newer   
 material is{Burwell 'white' brick     
 which used to be made here till quite 
 recently.
