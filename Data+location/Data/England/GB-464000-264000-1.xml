		<content>   The rectangle allocated to Kilndown 
C.E. Primary School contains parts of  
the Villages of Kilndown, Goudhurst    
and Lamberhurst. It lies in the Civil  
Parishes of Goudhurst, Lamberhurst and 
Horsmonden, and is administered by the 
Tunbridge Wells Borough Council. We    
are in the constituency of Tunbridge   
Wells and our M.P., Sir Patrick Mayhew,
lives in Kilndown.                     
   The area is covered by woodland,    
managed by the Scotney Estate, and     
farms, growing mainly hops, cereals    
and grass, although some soft fruit    
and potatoes also occur.               
   The churches of Kilndown and        
Lamberhurst are in this rectangle,     
along with Scotney Castle and the S.E. 
Regional Offices of the National Trust.
Finchcocks House contains a museum of  
keyboard instruments, open to the      
public.                                </content>
