		<content>  Army trucks at the Ministry of       
 Defence are driven onto a             
 platform.This platform lifts from one 
 side very gradually.The trucks are    
 chained to the platform.This test is  
 to see how many degrees the truck can 
 tilt,before its wheels come away from 
 the platform.                         
  The trucks also have to pass through 
 deep water before they pass the       
 test.This is to check for leaks,and   
 faulty equipment.The trucks also go   
 through different, some bumpy and some
 very dusty. Speed is another thing the
 trucks are tested for. Only when the  
 trucks have passed all the tests,     
 they can be used.
