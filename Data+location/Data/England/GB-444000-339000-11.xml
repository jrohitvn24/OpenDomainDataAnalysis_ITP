		<title>11Ilkeston Shopping - Town</title>
		<content> The main shopping area in Ilkeston is 
 a ribbon development stretching along 
 South Street to the Market Place and  
 from the Market Place down to the     
 bottom of Bath Street.  Along South   
 Street, the shops are mainly small    
 family businesses, whereas on Bath    
 Street most of the shops belong to    
 nationwide retailing establishments.  
 e.g Fine Fare, Argos, Marks &amp; Spencer.
 The only large departmental store is  
 the Co-op and even this is now sub-let
 to different concerns. e.g. Redmayne &amp;
 Todd Sports Equipment, Goldfinger     
 Jewellery.  On Thursday and Saturday  
 there is an open-air market with      
 stalls selling mainly fruit and       
 vegetables, household goods or        
 clothes.
