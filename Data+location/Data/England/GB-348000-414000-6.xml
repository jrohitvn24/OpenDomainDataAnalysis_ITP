    Walking Day started in 1874. Since 
then all church officials and members  
have taken part. It always begins with 
a service in church. This is followed  
by a walk to Bispham, back through the 
village to the Black Bull pub and then 
back to church. A hymn is sung and then
everyone goes to the field for tea and 
the fair. Every year it takes the same 
format. Several stops are made along   
the way for refreshments and for the   
morris dancers to perform. Walking Day 
always takes place on the second       
Saturday in July, and a full meal is   
provided. The marquee comes from       
Formby, and the hire firm erects it.   
The fair comes from Bolton. The fair   
arrives a week before Walking Day and  
it leaves a week after. The church     
council organises the event.
