		<content>{Yorkshire Main}coal is a natural      
 product formed from prehistoric       
 forests.{Yorkshire Main}in{Edlington} 
 sits on the{Barnsley Seam,}and has    
 approximately five years coal         
 production remaining. The main shaft  
 is 1 000m deep. There are twenty      
 workers who actually mine the coal,   
 which is taken to the bottom of the   
 shaft by conveyor, where it is taken  
 to the surface by the cage, signalled 
 by the ringing of a bell. The foot of 
 the shaft is large and well lit. Away 
 from the shaft the men carry their own
 lighting equipment. On the surface the
 coal is then washed and graded ready  
 for distribution.{Miners}are shift    
 workers starting their eight hour     
 shift at either 6 am, 2 pm or 10 pm,  
 with time allowed for changing.
