		<title>14A MUSLIM'S HOLY DAY</title>
		<content> We wake up at sunrise on our Festival 
 Day.We go into the bathroom and have a
 bath,clean our teeth,then get dressed.
 Next we go down into the kitchen to   
 make our breakfast.When we have       
 finished eating we put our special    
 praying caps on and go to the Y.M.C.A.
 Sports Centre to pray Namaz.After we  
 have prayed,we put on our best        
 clothes,then visit people's homes     
 to eat.At 3.00 we go to the mosque to 
 pray Namaz.After we have prayed,the   
 young people go to their local town   
 centre to spend the money which they  
 have been given on this holy day.At   
 6.00pm we return to the mosque to     
 pray.On this special day we have      
 a supper in the mosque after which we 
 go home to go to sleep.During this    
 time some of the important men of the 
 mosque(the elders)remain praying till 
 the next Namaz at 10.00pm.            </content>
