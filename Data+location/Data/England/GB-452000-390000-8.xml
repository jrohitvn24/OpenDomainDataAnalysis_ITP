		<title>08Maltby Model Village</title>
		<content> The Model Village was built to house  
 the workers at Maltby pit. Its        
 circular plan is derived from the     
 garden city movement. The brick houses
 once ringed a round green called the  
 bandstand,but this has now been       
 redeveloped with bungalows for the    
 elderly.                              
 I like living in the Model Village    
 because the air is clean and it is    
 near the country. There are grassy    
 play areas,but it is safer to play on 
 the road because of tins,glass and the
 nuisance of dogs. People in the Model 
 Village should train their pets and   
 stop them roaming around. On the back 
 streets there are hardly any lights   
 and it is not safe to go out at night.
 Nearby is Crags School and the Church 
 of the Ascension. Many miners still   
 live in the Model Village, but many   
 have bought their own homes.          </content>
