		<title>19Kettlethorpe Parish Council</title>
		<content> Kettlethorpe Parish Council covers the
 Kettlethorpe and Laughterton villages 
 and usually has seven elected members.
 If there are not enough nominees when 
 re-election is due after a three year 
 term, anyone who has been proposed and
 accepted automatically serves on the  
 Council. A clerk is employed to deal  
 with all correspondance etc. Various  
 planning and building applications are
 sent to the Council for their         
 consideration and the chance to voice 
 anxieties over any problems is given  
 by the West Lindsey District Council. 
 With limited funds allocated by West  
 Lindsey District Council, the Parish  
 Council looks after the needs of the  
 local community. The villages are     
 encouraged to enter the "Best Kept    
 Village" competition and the annual   
 inter- village Cricket and Rounders   
 matches.                              </content>
