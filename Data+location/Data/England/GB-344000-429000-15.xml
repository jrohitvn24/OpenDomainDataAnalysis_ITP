 Very few of these are                 
present; the finest is Clifton Hall,   
built in 1833 by Thomas Clifton, whose 
family owned the soil from mediaeval   
times until 1916, on the site of a     
former hall. Evidence of this can be   
seen in the cellars which are much     
older than the hall. Clifton windmill  
was built in 1785 and is a brick tower 
mill.Lund church dates back to 1824    
and is on the site of an earlier       
chapel. ANCIENT ROADS                  
The great Roman road running from      
Ribchester westwards passes through the
block through 44 31, 45 31, 46 31 and  
47 31;it is all underground and there  
is little left of it.                  
AGRICULTURE                            
85% of farming is either dairy or      
beef, the   the remainder is corn,     
poultry or horticulture.               </content>
