		<title>20Morwenstow - Playgroup</title>
		<content> This was founded  in 1978  to  provide
 children  with a  range of toys  which
 they would  not normally find at home.
 We also hope it  enables the  children
 to accept the  idea of sharing  before
 they go to primary school.            
 The playgroup is open to all  children
 up to  school age, but if the child is
 under  2\ a  parent  or  guardian must
 stay during the session.              
 There are two  sessions  weekly during
 school term, each lasting two hours.  
 The playgroup is run by volunteers who
 must be  qualified and approved by the
 local Social Services department.     
 There are  21 on the register; average
 attendance is 15 per session.         
                                       
                                       
    These pages were compiled by the   
    children parents  and friends of
