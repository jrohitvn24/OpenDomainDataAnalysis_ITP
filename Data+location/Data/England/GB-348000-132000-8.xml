		<title>08Butleigh Monument</title>
		<content> Butleigh monument towers above the    
 treeline in a clearing in the woods   
 about 30 feet above the road which    
 passes over the ridge dissecting the  
 vale. Above the road a steep wooded   
 bank leads up to an opening in the    
 wood. Butleigh monument towers about  
 150 feet into the air a tall, thin    
 column, which supports the celebrated 
 statue of{Sir Samuel Hood.}It         
 dominates the whole of the surrounding
 area with its size. It was set up to  
 commemorate the thoroughly eventful   
 and important life of Sir Samuel      
 Hood, a high_ranking officer of His   
 Majesty's fleet, who lived locally.His
 contributions politically and         
 militarially were vast, without which 
 England would not have held such a    
 commanding naval position in his time.
 He died at Madras on the 24 December  
 1814.The monument honours a great man.</content>
