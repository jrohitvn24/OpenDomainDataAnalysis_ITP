		<content>   As you first come into Seaton from  
 the main road you see a lovely view of
 the Axe Valley. When you walk to the  
 town centre you can then walk down to 
 the sea. You can also walk to the     
 harbour and follow the river Axe to   
 Colyford. You can also go across the  
 oldest concrete bridge in England.    
                                       
   Seaton is a pleasant town with      
 attractions like the Tramway, sea,    
 golfcourse, bowls, tennis, cricket,   
 football pitches, playing grounds,    
 fishing trips, windsurfing and all the
 pubs, restaurants, shops and gardens. 
                                       
   There is a lot of bird life on the  
 river Axe, like Curlews, Herons,      
 ducks and swans. You can see all the  
 marshes from the tramway, the Parish  
 Church of Seaton and all the rough    
 grazing fields of the marshes.        </content>
