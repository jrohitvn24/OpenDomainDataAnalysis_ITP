		<content>  Our community is very dependent on   
 the{Coal Mining Industry}for          
 employment. For many generations past 
 it was traditionally accepted that son
 would follow father into some sort of 
 occupation with the NCB.              
                                       
  In recent years there has been a     
 steady decline in mining operations,  
 partly due to the exhaustion of coal  
 seams and the closing down of pits    
 that have become uneconomic. This     
 decline has and will further be       
 accelerated by the national NUM strike
 of 1984/85.                           
                                       
  Rumours prevail in the community     
 that Frickley Colliery may be in      
 danger of closing in the near future. 
 Many men of 55 years and less are     
 being compulsory retired.
