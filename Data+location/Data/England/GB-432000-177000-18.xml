 sometimes do get injured,but only cuts
 and bruises.They do repair work on the
 vehicles.They have been building      
 coaches for 50 years.The company      
 employs about 38 men.The big coaches  
 cost Â£100,000 and the small ones      
 Â£15,000.This job involves much        
 paperwork.Because you need to be      
 skilled,you are paid very well.A large
 coach takes 3500 hours to build.      </content>
