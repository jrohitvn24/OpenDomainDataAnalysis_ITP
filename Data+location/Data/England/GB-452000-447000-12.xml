		<title>12Adventure Game Books</title>
		<content> Adventure game books started in 1983  
 and now are very popular with both    
 children and teenagers.They are       
 different because you are the hero or 
 heroine.I enjoy the books because they
 are like a game and a book at the same
 time.There are fifteen in the series  
 and they are all good.Here are just   
 some of them:The Warlock Of Fire Top  
 Mountain,The Citadel Of Chaos,The     
 Forest Of Doom,The City Of            
 Thieves,Scorpion Swamp and Starship   
 Traveller.You need a pencil, two dice 
 and of course one of the books.They   
 are written by Steve Jackson and Ian  
 Livingstone.At the start of the book  
 there is an Adventure Sheet where you 
 jot down your score and details like  
 what weapons you have and how much    
 gold you own.
