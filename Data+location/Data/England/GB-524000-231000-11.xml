    In the 1970's a central area of    
 Baldock, the site of Pryor's (later   
 Simpsons) brewery was redeveloped.    
 Most of the brewery buildings were    
 demolished, and replaced with a       
 housing estate, with access to the    
 High Street. Part of the brew house   
 was retained and converted into a     
 community centre.                     
    A large housing estate is now under
 construction on Clothall Common, land 
 NE of the Clothall road. The          
 associated increase in population     
 required the construction of a new    
 primary school.                       
    No housing estate development is   
 allowed in other parts of the area,   
 which forms part of the Hertfordshire 
 green belt.
