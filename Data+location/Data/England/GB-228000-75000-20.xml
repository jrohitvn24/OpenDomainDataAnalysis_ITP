		<title>20Coads Green Methodist Chapel</title>
		<content> Tha chapel is intimately tied in with 
 the life of the community in this     
 grid.The original chapel(now one of   
 school classrooms) was built in 1826. 
 The present chapel sited next to the  
 school was built in 1849.             
 In 1985 the number on the chapel roll 
 is 84 with an average congregation of 
 55.During this year activities have   
 been organised to raise money for the 
 starving people of Ethiopia and Sudan.
 The Shell Group(Methodist Jnr.Youth   
 Club) held a sponsored stinging nettle
 pick for Ethiopia which reached the   
 national radio news.                  
 The present minister Rev.Webber is    
 responsible for the services at 11    
 chapels(this includes Trewint John    
 Wesley's Cornish accomodation).       
 The chapel holds its Sunday School for
 two age groups in the village school.
