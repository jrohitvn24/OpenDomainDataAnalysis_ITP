		<title>08PETS IN SHIPSTON</title>
		<content>  There is currently a campaign in     
 the town of Shipston-on-Stour to      
 discourage people from letting their  
 pet dogs foul the pavements.          
  We interviewed people in the town    
 centre about their pets.Approximately 
 two out of every three people we      
 interviewed had a pet of some sort.   
  Cats and dogs were equally the most  
 popular,35% of the people interviewed 
 had one or the other(or both.)        
  Here is a list of the most common    
 pets in order of popularity: cats and 
 dogs,fish,rabbits,budgerigars,hamsters
 parrots,mice and guinea pigs.         
  Some people kept quite unusual pets. 
 One lady kept 80 newts.There were also
 snakes chameleons,spiders,terrapins   
 and tree crabs.                       
  One person kept 700 assorted birds.  
                                       
                                       </content>
