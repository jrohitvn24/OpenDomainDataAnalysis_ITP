		<title>17A MORNING IN LYNDSAYS LIFE</title>
		<content> In the morning when I wake up,I sit in
 bed for a minute then I get some      
 clothes from my wardrobe and put them 
 on my bed.I get washed,then put the   
 television on.I leave my bed unmade   
 and my pyjamas in the room but the    
 rest of the bedroom is tidy.I have my 
 Rice Crispies and go back upstairs to 
 watch television.If my little sister  
 wakes up its trouble,first I have to  
 make her breakfast and make her a     
 bottle of tea.Then I tell her to wake 
 up my big sister Sarah so she goes    
 running into her bedroom and shouts   
 "Sarah" and hits her.When I have      
 finished watching television and my   
 mum and dad are up I go into the Beer 
 Garden and play.Then I call for my    
 next door neighbour and play with her 
 at tennis.Sometimes we play in a tent 
 that her dad has made us.Then I go in 
 for dinner,a sandwich and some crisps.</content>
