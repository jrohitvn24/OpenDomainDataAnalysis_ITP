		<content>      Because this is an area of       
 traditional farming with relatively   
 little pollution and destruction of   
 the countryside, wild life is         
 abundant.  Some of the species more   
 commonly observed include deer,       
 rabbit, hare, pheasant, buzzard,      
 salmon and trout.  Members of the     
 local community have varied interests 
 in wild-life - there are active       
 conservation groups as well as        
 poachers and fox hunters!  Wild mink  
 and heron are considered nuisances by 
 fishermen.  One local character       
 interviewed described how he trapped  
 mink and then put his gun through the 
 bars of the cage.  As the mink grabbed
 the end of the gun with its mouth he  
 shot it.  This same man has a badgers'
 set above his house which is regularly
 observed by a conservationist.
