		<content>   One of the problems of building new 
houses in our area is that local people
are not always very happy about where  
these homes are built.Recently there   
has been a great fuss over made over   
the development of a piece of land     
behind my house.The grass has been cut 
and the trees chopped down.All the     
houses in our road have lost half of   
their back gardens so we haven't got   
much garden left.People feel very angry
about this.the local newspaper has been
up to interview people living in the   
road and take photographs and Southern 
Television has sent a camera crew to   
fil report for the news programme Coast
to Coast.People think that too many    
houses are going to be crammed into the
field and that will spoil things for   
everyone else.Local children are also  
 ngry because they have lost a good    
place to play.                         </content>
