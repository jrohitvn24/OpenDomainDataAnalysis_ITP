		<content> Internally many terraced houses have  
 been rebuilt to match the developments
 since their building,e.g.connection to
 main services,the last one being      
 electricity, and inside toilets and   
 modern kitchens. Central heating has  
 replaced the open fires and the houses
 are now bright and clean.             
    In the 1930s and 1950s semi        
 -detached brick built or cement       
 rendered houses were constructed,     
 sometimes in large estates for the    
 town council, sometimes in small      
 groups by local builders. Since 1965  
 the pattern has been estates of 20 or 
 30 similar,not identical houses in    
 brick with tiled roofs. Attached      
 garages reflect the use of the motor  
 car. Garden provision has become      
 almost universal as well. The latest  
 change is the use of plastic window   
 and door frames.                      </content>
