		<content> The farming in this area is mainly    
 arable with wheat,barley,oats,rapeseed
 oil and potatoes being the main crops 
 grown.There are 14 farms in the Roos  
 and Tunstall area,most of them being  
 mixed farms with arable and livestock 
 sections.The main livestock are pigs  
 and cattle with small herds of sheep. 
 The farmers with livestock tend to use
 the local markets of Hull and Beverley
 when buying and selling.There is an   
 abbatoir in Roos, which is used by    
 local farmers and butchers.It is only 
 7 years old.                          
 The majority of farms in Roos are     
 situated at Northend,although there   
 are some in "old" Roos, near the      
 church.At Tunstall there 5 farms;these
 being situated in the village itself. 
 Some of the farmers have fields which 
 cannot be cultivated,as they are too  
 near to cliffs,affected by erosion.   </content>
