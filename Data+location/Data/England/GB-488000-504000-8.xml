		<content> This area of the North York Moor      
 National Park abounds in wild life.   
 The wild moorland is the home of      
 grouse and pheasants, rabbits, hares  
 and the only poisonous snake in       
 England, the Adder.                   
 The forest areas are the homes of     
 foxes, birds, squirrels and deer.     
 The Red Grouse amd Pheasants attract  
 the attention of sportsmen who help in
 the conservation of the area by       
 rearing birds every year and releasing
 them on the moor.                     
 Foxes are not welcomed by the farmers 
 as they do much damage at the farms by
 killing chickens and ducks.           
 Many birds nest in the trees including
 woodpeckers, snipe, sparrows, blue and
 great tits, tawny and barn owls.      
 Sparrow hawks can be seen hovering    
 over the moor looking for food.
