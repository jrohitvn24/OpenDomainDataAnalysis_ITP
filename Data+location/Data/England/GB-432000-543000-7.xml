		<title>07LITTLETOWN HOUSE by T.Taylor</title>
		<content>   Littletown House,built of local     
 stone and standing in some 2 acres of 
 land,was built in 1820 as a residence 
 for the Owner of the newly-discovered 
 coalmine.It remained the Owner's or   
 Manager's house until after           
 nationalisation in 1946,when the NCB  
 used it as the HQ for their current   
 Manager and staff.                    
   Littletown House is now privately   
 owned and split into three freehold   
 properties:Groom's Cottage,the old    
 stable block;Main Wing and Gardener's 
 Cottage,the previous original         
 building;and East Wing,where I now    
 live,consists of the servants'        
 quarters together with an 1897        
 addition which includes a pitch-pine  
 balcony and verandah commanding views 
 down to Durham Cathedral.
