		<title>15Mining near Gunnislake</title>
		<content> The{Gunnislake Clitters Mine}was      
 started in or about 1820 for copper.  
 The adit which  cut across several    
 lodes was  eventually 3/4 mile long   
 and more than 600 feet below surface. 
 In 1900 the company was amalgamated   
 with other mines in the locality of   
 Chilsworthy/Latchley under the name of
{Clitters United.}Today a group of     
 engine houses is still standing, one  
 close to the River Tamar with dressing
 floors.Above these in Clitters Wood   
 are two arsenic stacks and the old    
 gunnis workings.A tramway which used  
 to link up with other mines and       
 quarries to carry copper ore is now   
 part of a footpath leading to         
 Bitthams.{The proposed recovery of tin
{from the waste heaps by the Company of
{S.W. Minerals could create up to      
{40 jobs lasting approximately 2 years.
