		<content> THE SLACKS ARE LOW AREAS BETWEEN THE  
 DUNES, WHICH ARE OFTEN DEEP ENOUGH TO 
 HAVE FRESHWATER PONDS FOR MUCH OF THE 
 YEAR.THESE ARE THE BREEDING GROUNDS OF
 THE FAMOUS NATTERJCK TOAD. THIS IS    
 MAINLY A NOCTURNAL ANIMAL WHICH HAS A 
 YELLOW STRIPE DOWN ITS BACK. IT IS    
 BECOMING SO RARE THAT IT IS NOW       
 PROTECTED BY LAW. TO ENCOURAGE THE    
 SUCCESSFUL BREEDING OF THE NATTERJACK 
 TOADS IN THIS AREA A NUMBER OF        
 ARTIFICIAL TOAD-SCRAPES HAVE BEEN DUG 
 IN THE SLACKS.
