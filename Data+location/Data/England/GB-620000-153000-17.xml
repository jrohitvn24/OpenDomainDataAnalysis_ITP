		<title>17Adisham: Entertainment</title>
		<content>   Adisham village provides little in  
the way of entertainment. About eight  
dances a year are held in the hall,    
which is also used for wedding         
receptions and parties.  A flourishing 
drama group has recently collapsed     
without a producer. The public house   
provides live music most evenings.     
  The life style of the younger        
members of the community and their     
ownership of cars means that enter-    
tainment is mainly sought outside,     
although some go by train. Cinemas in  
nearby towns are used, and theatres or 
concert halls as far afield as London. 
  Visiting friends and relatives for a 
meal is the most common form of enter- 
taining, with meals at a restaurant    
very popular.  Holidays were taken at  
home or abroad, and caravans were      
taken abroad, especially by families   
with children.                         </content>
