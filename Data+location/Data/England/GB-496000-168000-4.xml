		<title>04A VISIT TO SAVILL GARDENS</title>
		<content> In Savill Gardens they grow flowers   
 like Camellia,Magnolia,Primula,irises,
 Daffodils,Bluebells,Hydrangia and     
 Japanese Maple.They all have to be    
 grown in acid soil otherwise they     
 wont grow.The Queen and many other    
 members of the Royal family either    
 walk or ride through the gardens.They 
 have about 100,000 visitors a year    
 and 80% of them are local and live    
 around the area.Mr Bond, the man who  
 we spoke to,is in charge of the park  
 and gardens, he has worked there for  
 26 years, he would not want to change 
 to another park or garden.Savill      
 Garden is very busy on Sundays and    
 Bank Holidays especially.The garden   
 opened in 1948 and is still open      
 now.Eric Savill took charge of the    
 gardens.Then the Queen knighted him   
 and when he died the gardens were     
 named in his honour.                  </content>
