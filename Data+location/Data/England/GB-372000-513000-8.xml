		<title>08Farming in this area</title>
		<content> Most farms in this area are medium    
 sized,stocking cows and sheep.Most    
 of the cows are Friesian cows which   
 supply milk.The milk is collected     
 and taken to the dairy in Appleby.    
 Some cows breed calfs which are sold  
 for meat.Some farmers keep Leicester  
 sheep too.Most land is used to grow   
 grass which is cut for silage or hay  
 and stored for winter feed. A few     
 farmers grow turnips.Most farmers have
 a lot of machinery.Many farmers have  
 a tractor and a chopper,mower,trailer 
 and a hay bob used at silage time.    
 Most farms at hay time have a         
 bail sledge,bailer and mower.         
 Many farmers in this area have been   
 upset by the cuts in the amount of    
 milk they can produce.
