		<title>04TRANSPORT:RURAL NEEDS</title>
		<content>  In an area with small isolated       
 communities it is vital to have some  
 form of transport. With no shop,no    
 public house and one Post Office it   
 is almost impossible to cope with     
 modern life unless some form of       
 transport is used. Many fathers are   
 employed outside the area and they    
 drive or ride to work. Farmers        
 frequently visit the local markets and
 use{tractors}as their means of        
 tranport.{Pick-up vans}and{estate cars
 and{Land Rovers}are well-suited to    
 winter driving in narrow lanes.       
  Any vehicle going by usually merits a
 gaze and the passage of the day can be
 measured by the timing of the{milk    
{lorry or the school bus.}A visitor's  
 car is soon spotted but familiar faces
 and vehicles are greeted with a       
 friendly wave.Neighbours help each    
 other out if transport problems arise.</content>
