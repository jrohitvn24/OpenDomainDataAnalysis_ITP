		<content>  {We'll Meet Again} A while ago a film
 all about the Second World War.It was 
 shot in Lenham.The village square was 
 used as the main setting and for a    
 while the residents of Lenham had to  
 put up with having the film crew      
 around the place.The village library  
 was used as the Roxy Cinema and       
 Rebecca's the antique shop,was the    
 Post Office and general store. The    
 Dog and Bear Public House was used for
 the Plough.The Village Hall was used  
 for the dances and entertainment.     
   Although it was exciting to see our 
 village used it was rather annoying as
 vehicles could not be parked in the   
 square.When the programme was shown it
 was fun seeing all the shops and the  
 country lanes near Chilston Park that 
 we know.
