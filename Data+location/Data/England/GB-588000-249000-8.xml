		<title>08Lavenham First School</title>
		<content>Lavenham has a primary school built in 
1896. The building originally housed 3 
separate schools catering for children 
of all ages who lived in the village.It
replaced the school which was held in  
the Church Rooms and it augmented the  
British National School on the Market  
Place.This building has since been     
demolished but the present school      
benefits from a residual trust.During  
the late 1950s children of secondary   
school age were removed to Stoke by    
Nayland. Educational provision in      
Suffolk was reorganised in 1972.Now    
the village school has a roll of about 
100 children,aged 5 to 9, from Lavenham
and surrounding villages. At 9 most    
chilren transfer to Stoke By Nayland   
Middle School,where they remain until  
they move to Great Cornard Upper       
School,Sudbury at the age of 13.
