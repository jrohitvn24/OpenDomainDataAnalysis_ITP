		<title>12THE WILTSHIRE RIVER TILL</title>
		<content> The river Till rises from springs     
 upstream at Tilshead. It flows through
 Orcheston, Shrewton then meanders     
 through the meadows to Winterbourne   
 Stoke and on to Berwick St James to   
 join with the Wylye at Stapleford.    
 This 'winterbourne' got its name from 
 the upper reaches of the chalk streams
 which dry up during the Summer months,
 and the springs start to bubble and   
 seep up into the dry courses during   
 November and December, and the brooks 
 are at their highest level in February
 The level though, does depend on the  
 rainfall during the previous Summer   
 and Autumn.                           
 All the streams of Salisbury Plain are
 crystal clear, and even when one flows
 past a muddy farmyard, it purifies    
 itself quite quickly. Cattle are often
 seen drinking from it and moorhens and
 ducks nest regularly along its banks. </content>
