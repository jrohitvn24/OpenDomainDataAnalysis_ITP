		<title>07Windsurfing</title>
		<content> My family hobby is windsurfing and we 
 all go windsurfing at{Stonar Lake,    
 Sandwich. The boards, made of         
{fibreglass}cost about Â£100 each. A    
 windsurfer originated from a boat when
 an architect had an idea to make a    
 craft lighter than a boat with the    
 person on the craft{standing up.}But  
 as the craft was so light there could 
 not be a fixed mast. So that problem  
 was solved by putting a bendy piece of
 rubber onto the bottom of the mast    
 which was connected to a hole in the  
 board, so when the man on the board   
 let go of the boom the mast fell into 
 the water. This craft was called a    
 windsurfer because it is made mainly  
 out of a surfboard and it uses wind to
 move it along. It does not really     
 matter what clothing you wear but most
 people wear a{wetsuit.
