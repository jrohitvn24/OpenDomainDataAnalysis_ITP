		<content> Mrs Lane and class 4 visted MacBrides 
 farm.                                 
      We went to vist a farm. First we 
 looked at the goslings and the geese, 
 the goslings were fluffy we stroked   
 them.We saw sheep and they were fluffy
 too.We went near a tractor,and went on
 it.There were lots of buttons and     
 levers to press,I pretended to drive  
 it.We went in the milking shed where  
 the cows get milked. We saw a box it  
 was metal and there was creamy milk in
 it.We saw a heifer and there was one I
 liked best because it was funny.
