		<title>14CWM DALE SPRING   STRETTON</title>
		<content>    The Cwm Dale Spring is owned by    
 Wells Drinks Ltd. but is known locally
 as the Pop Works.                     
    The Pop Works has very special     
 water because of the pureness of the  
 spring water. Their factory is in     
 Church Stretton and they bottle the   
 water there. They also sell coke,     
 orangeade and some other things.      
                                       
    Outside there is a notice saying   
           {S.H.M.W.CO                 
{  Manufacturer of mineral waters      
{       The Cwm Dale Spring            
{This is one of the purest waters      
{which has ever come under my notice   
{or of which I have seen any record.   
{   Francis Sutton. F.C.S.F.I.C.       
                                       
    The water is bottled and sent all  
 over the world and people come from   
 a long way to get it.                 </content>
