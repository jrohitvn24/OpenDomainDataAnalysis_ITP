		<title>01Summary of Area</title>
		<content> Our area follows the winding course of
 the{River Tamar}which is the natural  
 border of the counties of Devon and   
 Cornwall.The whole of our survey area 
 has a history of mining mainly for    
 copper and arsenic.On the Devon side  
 there used to be the{Devon Consol     
{Mines}which finished mining for       
 copper in 1902 but continued working  
 for arsenic until 1940. This is now   
 surrounded by a large area of forestry
 which is known as Tavistock Woodlands.
 On the Cornish side we have the       
{Clitters Mines}which helped in the    
 development of the town of{Gunnislake.
 There is the  village of{Chilsworthy  
 and the four small hamlets of{        
{Latchley, Townlake,Horsebridge}and{   
{Cox Park}which are surrounded for the 
 large part by agricultural land.      
 The whole area is scenically          
 beautiful.                            </content>
