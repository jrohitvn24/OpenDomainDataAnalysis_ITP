		<content>  The older part of Chipstead is on a  
 hill, but below a number of roads have
 developed near the station, where     
 there is also a row of shops called   
 Chipstead Parade.                     
  The roads are of tar and concrete and
 they are in very good condition. There
 are good bright lights along the      
 pavements. If you took a walk along   
 the street you would see people       
 reading their daily newspapers and    
 walking their dogs.                   
  Nearby there is a large golf course. 
 If people don't play golf, they might 
 be found playing football. There are  
 also six tennis courts in Chipstead,  
 three of which have been built very   
 recently.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
