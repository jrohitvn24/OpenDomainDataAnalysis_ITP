		<content> In St Mary's west tower is a font and 
 around the edges of the walls are     
 piles of crumbled bricks. Separating  
 the west tower from the nave is a     
 glass screen. The main nave and north 
 and south aisles are full of oak pews.
 In the chancel is an alter and to the 
 keft is an original organ. An electric
 organ now stands in the nave. In the  
 vestry are props and to the left is a 
 doorway leading to the north aisle.   
 The windows are war memorials with    
 sebmarines and planes. Underneath are 
 some brass rubbings. The south aisle  
 has windows of Jesus and brass        
 rubbings beneath. St Cyriacs is empty 
 and the walls are bare. There is a    
 memorial plaque. There are also wooden
 pillars separating the aisles. At the 
 entrance is a staircase which leads to
 the balcony.                          
                                       </content>
