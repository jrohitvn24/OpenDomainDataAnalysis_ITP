		<title>11LIFE IN WOODFIELD DONCASTER</title>
		<content> As a 14 year old girl I find this area
 very pleasant. Our house is within    
 walking distance of my school, shops  
 and large open spaces including a golf
 course. There is also a regular bus   
 service to Doncaster.                 
   The school has a youth club with all
 the modern equipment in a nice new    
 building and discos are run regularly.
 Some of my friends attitude is that   
 life here is boring but I only get    
 bored when it's raining.              
   In the summer it is nice because you
 can walk round the golf course or just
 sunbathe. There is plenty of space    
 everywhere. The sewage works may smell
 a bit unpleasant in the summer but    
 after living in a place for 14 years  
 you can get used to anything.
