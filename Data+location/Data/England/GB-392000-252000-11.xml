		<title>11Religion; Upton Snodsbury.</title>
		<content> Each of the four villages is centred  
 round a church of ancient foundation .
 St Kenelm's, Upton Snodsbury has a    
 fine square 15th century tower with a 
 full peal of 6 bells, and an older    
 nave and chancel. Kenelm was a local  
 8th century saint who is buried at    
 nearby Winchcombe Abbey and there are 
 5 churchs dedicated to him - reputedly
 each founded where his body rested on 
 the way to Winchcombe from the Welsh  
 border.   St.Leonard's, Broughton     
 Hackett, is a tiny church dating from 
 the 13th and 14th centuries with a    
 small half timbered tower.            
 These two parishes share a vicar with 
 3 other parishes outside this area, as
 the present trend is for adjaceent    
 small villages communities to be      
 grouped together under 1 incumbent.   
 The present vicar lives at Grafton    
 Flyford.                              </content>
