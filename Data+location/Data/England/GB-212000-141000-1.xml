		<title>01Lundy Island-the South.</title>
		<content> Lundy Island falls into 3 D blocks.   
 For reasons of convienience and space 
 all those things that relate to the   
 ecology of the island are dealt with  
 in the north,as are the children's    
 experiences. Likewise the history of  
 the island and information regarding  
 tourism are dealt with in the south.  
 The central block contains the main   
 settlement.                           
 Lundy lies 11 miles off the North     
 Devon coast.It is owned by the        
 National Trust and run by the Landmark
 Trust.It has a small resident         
 population and its main industry is   
 tourism-with some farming.The island  
 has its own supply ship and a weekly  
 helicopter service.                   
 Although only 3 miles long and about  
 half a mile wide the island has a     
 wealth of interest- and the scenery   
 and peace are magnificent.            </content>
