		<title>09A TYPICAL DAY:SCHOOL BOY</title>
		<content>   I wake up at 7.30a.m. I get         
 straight up and have a wash(including 
 my hair!). I go downstairs and eat    
 cornflakes with milk and sugar for my 
 breakfast and then leave for school.  
 It takes me 1/2 an hour to walk to    
 Evelyns Comprehensive School. School  
 starts at 8.45a.m. and finishes at    
 3.35p.m.We start by having the        
 register taken in our form rooms.Twice
 a week we have assembly which is not  
 religious.A typical day's lessons     
 would be Science,Maths,History,French 
 and English.After school I generally  
 goes to the computer room to play     
 games.In the evenings there is not    
 much to do around this area.What it   
 really needs is a leisure/sports      
 centre.I usually go to bed at around  
 11 p.m.
