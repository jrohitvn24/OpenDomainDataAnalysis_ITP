		<title>15PIGEON RACING IN HAUGHTON</title>
		<content> Pigeons are raced in the summer months
 and shown in the winter. There are 6  
 pigeon fanciers in our area who enjoy 
 their sport very much. They are all   
 members of Bunbury Homing Society     
 which in turn is a member of the      
 Cheshire Plains Federation. The racing
 season is divided into three sections 
 which are; the Inland Old Bird races, 
 the Water races - again with the old  
 birds - and inland young bird races.  
 The birds race from the south - the   
 nearest race point being Hereford, and
 the furthest being Niost - a distance 
 of 476 miles. The federation owns a   
 transporter which collects the pigeons
 from the clubs and transports them to 
 the race point. The fanciers are then 
 informed of the time of liberation and
 the prevailing wind. A good pigeon on 
 an easy flight can travel at a speed  
 of a mile a minute.                   </content>
