		<content> Our school is for children with a     
 physical disability and is named after
 a former mayor of Rochdale. Until     
 recently, children in Rochdale with   
 severe physical handicaps had to go to
 residential schools. In 1974          
 Fieldhouse School opened for these    
 children and was known as a 'special' 
 school. In 1978 the Warnock Report    
 said that children with special needs 
 ought to be able to integrate into    
 ordinary schools and so our new school
 was built to join with Whittaker Moss 
 Primary School. We join with the      
 children next door for singing, P.E., 
 swimming and other lessons. We also   
 have special facilities such as a     
 hydrotherapy pool and physiotherapy.  
 Whittaker Moss children come from     
 Norden but we are transported to      
 school from all over the district.
