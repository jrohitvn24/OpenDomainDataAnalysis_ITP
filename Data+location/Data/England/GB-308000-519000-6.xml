		<title>06ST. MICHAEL'S LAMPLUGH</title>
		<content> St. Michael's church is one of the    
 churches in the parish of Lamplugh    
 with Ennerdale. There has been a      
 church on the site for 800 years. The 
 present church is a 100 years old.    
 There are about 25 people working for 
 the church. They include 12 sidesmen, 
 1 cleaner, 1 grave digger, 1 vicar, 2 
 organists and 1 grasscutter. There is 
 one service every week and it lasts 1 
 hour. About 16 people come each time  
 unless there is a wedding or a        
 funeral. The Reverand Simpson works in
 Lamplugh, Kirkland and Ennerdale      
 church. There isn't a choir unless    
 there is a very special occasion. The 
 members of the church take it in turns
 to put flowers in the church.
