There has been a church in Mendlesham  
since 1060 and the oldest part of the  
present church was built in 1200.  It  
is built from flint and stone.  It has 
a high, square tower with four bells.  
Mendlesham  has an armoury.  It is in  
a little   room over the porch which   
is 500 years old.  It has some         
armour leg and body  pieces and some   
helmets.  There are also three chests, 
part of a long bow and many other      
interesting things. Inside the church  
it is painted white but many years ago 
the walls  had pictures painted on     
them.  There are some carved wooden    
bench ends.  There  is also nice       
carving on the   pulpit and over the   
font.  The church   has a vinegar      
bible and there are two  funeral       
biers. Set on the floor is a brass     
figure of John Knyvet.                 </content>
