		<title>12Helen's day in Wishford.</title>
		<content> I wake up at about 6.45am I fetch my  
 dog to bed or I read until I am told  
 to get up at 7.30am.I have my         
 breakfast,wash and dress for school.  
 Then I feed my rabbit and walk my dog.
    At 8.45am I leave for school in    
 mum's car.At school I enjoy writing   
 and like the Domesday Project.At      
 3.15pm my sister and I are picked up  
 by mum.                               
    At home I change and play with my  
 sister on the bike or I take the dog  
 for a walk.Sometimes I look at my     
 horse things or my stamp collection   
 with my dad,or I help my dad in the   
 garden.                               
   At 5.30pm I go in for my tea.I watch
 television for an hour then I have a  
 bath and go to bed at 7.30pm and read 
 until 8.00pm.
