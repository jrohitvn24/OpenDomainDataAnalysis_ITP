		<content> AT SCHOOL MY FAVOURITE GAME IS        
 SKIPPING.WE PLAY I'M A LITTLE BUMPER  
 CAR WHERE YOU HAVE TO JUMP IN ,THEN   
 JUMP OUT AND RUN ROUND THE BACK OF THE
 SKIPPERS ,THEN JUMP BACK IN AGAIN.WE  
 PLAY BLUEBELLS AND COCKLESHELLS,AND   
 DOWN THE MISTER ZIPPY.SOMETIMES WE    
 JUST DO SKIPPING ON OUR OWN AND SEE   
 HOW MANY TIMES WE CAN SKIP OVER THE   
 ROPE.                                 
 MY FAVOURITE GAME IS HORSES.YOU NEED  
 AROPE AND YOU TIE IT ROUND YOUR FRIEND
 AND THEN RUN ROUND THE PLAYGROUND LIKE
 A HORSE AND A RIDER BEHIND.           
 MY FAVOURITE GAME IS OFF GROUND       
 TAG.YOUCHASE AFTER SOMEONE AND TAG    
 THEM BUT IF THEY JUMP OFF THE GROUND  
 ONTO SOMETHING YOU CAN'T TAG THEM,YOU 
 HAVE TO WAIT TILL THEY RUN OFF AGAIN.
