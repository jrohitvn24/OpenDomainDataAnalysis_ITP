		<content> The Hoppa bus service was started in  
 November 1984 as a new circular       
 service of mini-buses around          
 St.Austell.These buses,made by        
 Mercedes and carrying up to 19        
 passengers,start at 6.30a.m.to        
 take early morning workers and        
 those catching the first trains.They  
 continue until 11p.m.on weekdays and  
 between 8a.m. and 6p.m. they run every
 ten minutes.They link the main        
 residential areas of St.Austell with  
 the station and centre of the town.   
 Hoppas are allowed to travel along    
 Fore St.to pick up and put down       
 passengers,although other traffic is  
 banned.Outside the town centre these  
 buses can be hailed by putting your   
 hand up,and the driver will stop      
 anywhere providing it is safe to do   
 so.
