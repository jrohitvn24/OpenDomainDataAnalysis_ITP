		<title>16A Day in My Life in Ingleton</title>
		<content> This is a typical day in my life. This
 morning I awoke at 8.00am.I had       
 cornflakes for my breakfast,I followed
 this with two digestive biscuits and a
 cup of tea. I left for school at      
 8.30am and arrived at school at       
 8.45am.School started at 9.00am and   
 for the first quarter of an hour I    
 read my book. I followed this by      
 writing my play for our final assembly
 of the year,my play was about a fire  
 in school.We pretended there was a    
 fire in the hall and we discussed how 
 we would deal with it.My next lesson  
 was mathematics and we all worked out 
 on which day of the week we were born 
 using a formula. My date of birth is  
 16th December 1974 and I worked out   
 that I was born on a Monday.At 12 noon
 it was time for dinner, I have school 
 dinners and on this day we had risotto
 and for pudding we had semolina.      </content>
