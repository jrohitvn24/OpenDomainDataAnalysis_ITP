		<title>01TENTERDEN</title>
		<content>   Tenterden is a country town with a  
 population of over 6000 people. During
 the day it is very busy as people from
 round about come to the shops.The car 
 parks are very expensive so there are 
 always lots of cars parked in the     
 streets which makes it difficult to   
 cross the road.The traffic warden is  
 always busy in Tenterden.There is only
 one safe place to cross the main road 
 in Tenterden and that is the Pelican  
 Crossing near the church,and although 
 we have a lollipop lady at the end of 
 the school road in the morning and    
 after school, at other times it is    
 difficult to cross the road and you   
 have to be careful and use your Green 
 Cross Code. Our church is called      
 St.Mildred's it's tower and clock can 
 be seen from all over the town.The    
 church was started in the 12th century
 but the tower was built in the 15th.  </content>
