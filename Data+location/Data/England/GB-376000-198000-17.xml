 Little remains of the Middle Ages in

 During the mid 19th Century,Uley      
 became an important woollen centre. It
 was during these times that the school
 and the village hall were built. The  
 biggest mill belonged to a family     
 called the Sheppards. However,the     
 collapse of the woollen industry      
 brought dreadful unemployment and     
 poverty which drove quite a few       
 families to emigrate to America and   
 Australia. The present day descendants
 of these people are currently being   
 traced by the school. The collapse of 
 the woollen industry gradually        
 returned the village to a sleepy rural
 place with just a few cottage         
 industries and residential houses.
