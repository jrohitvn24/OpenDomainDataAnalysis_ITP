		<title>13MANOR FARM,BARNSTON</title>
		<content> This farm was built in 1849.The farm  
 is approximately{82 acres,}spreading  
 as  far as Dale Meadow,Crewn Croft and
 Railway Field in the north and to     
 Whitehouse Lane fields in the south.  
 Back Field and Lodge Field are near to
 the farmhouse.                        
   This is a{dairy farm}with a herd of 
 124 British Fresians;80 milking cows, 
 2 bulls,42 calves and calving cows.   
   In{summer}the cows graze in fields  
 and return to the new milking parlour 
 twice daily. In{winter}they are housed
 in a large barn.                      
   The{new milking parlour}was         
 necessary because of mastitis in the  
 cows and the size of herd was limited 
 until the building was complete.New   
 E.E.C.regulations then prohibited     
 restoration of the herd to its former 
 size,thus making paying off the bank  
 loan for the parlour very difficult.  </content>
