AKELEY WOOD is made up of a mixture of 
larch, crab, holly, conifers, rhododen-
drons, oak, ash and sycamore.  The cen-
tral area is used for rearing young    
guinea fowl and game birds.  A shooting
syndicate of local people own the Wood.
Land cover is mainly grazing with small
areas of crops and rough pasture plus  
10 active bee hives, producing some    
200 lb of honey in a good year.        
                                       
STOWE CASTLE was built in the early    
18th century for Lord Cobham.  It is a 
group of two-storied cottages with     
lean-to roofs against a curved, turret-
ted stone wall with 5 square towers.
