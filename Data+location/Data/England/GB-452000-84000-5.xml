		<content>     Hale Manor was built in 1560.  The
 house is unusual because the original 
 structure still stands.               
     At present the house is lived in  
 by Mr David Brown, his wife Mandy and 
 their 3 children.  The surrounding    
 farm is part of a family farming      
 company involving Mr Brown and his    
 three brothers.  The farming          
 enterprise runs to 2,300 acres and    
 comprises Hale Manor Farm, Haseley    
 Farm, Combley Farm, Alerston Manor    
 Farm, Pagham Farm, Great Budbridge    
 Farm and Waightshale.                 
     There are two dairy herds of 120  
 cows each.  All the calves are reared 
 on the farms _ the steers reared for  
 beef, and the heifers are put in calf 
 at about 2 years.  The livestock takes
 up about 800 acres.  The remaining    
 acreage is used for arable crops.
