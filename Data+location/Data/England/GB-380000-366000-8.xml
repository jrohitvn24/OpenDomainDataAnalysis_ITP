		<content>  We also found within our area 8 old  
 cottages built 150-200 years ago.These
 have recently been renovated with     
 added extensions.However, they have   
 all kept their character and blend in 
 with the neighbouring buildings.      
 The number of rooms varied            
 considerably according to the size and
 nature of the buildings.The larger    
 farmhouses had up to 18 rooms, whereas
 the the smaller houses had 6-8 rooms  
 of average size.All were fitted with  
 neccessities and luxuries, a far cry  
 from what life would have been like   
 way back in 1086.Duration of living in
 their houses ranged from 5 months,    
 this being a small, modernised        
 cottage, to 60 years, this being a    
 farmer and his family.Overall, all the
 houses were equipped with a large     
 garden, particularly the farm houses.
