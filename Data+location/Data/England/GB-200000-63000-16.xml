		<content> The houses in our 12 square kilometres
 are made of several building materials
 -stone, brick and granite. Some of the
 houses are decorated outside with     
 ornaments, baskets of flowers or      
 cartwheels. The gateposts are often   
 made of granite and granite blocks are
 sometimes used in garden designs.The  
 oldest houses are near the Green and  
 church, some looking like old mining  
 cottages. (There used to be mines near
 Lamorick - one was called Wheal       
 Prosper). There are new housing       
 estates at Woodland View and Woodland 
 Glade built within the last fifteen   
 years.Some of the businesses in the   
 area benefit from the summer tourism- 
 B and B, two fish and chip shops, the 
 petrol filling station and a pub.There
 are two old people's homes, one       
 private and one council, both some    
 distance from the shops and centre.   </content>
