		<content>  This is a sparsely populated area of 
 scattered owner-occupied farms.The    
 farms are traditionally run by family 
 heirs and therefore there is little   
 movement of population.Some farmers do
 employ local people,but usually only  
 on a seasonal basis.                  
  Boldron Village is the only area of  
 any significant population.It has 30  
 properties of which 5 are farms.The   
 older type of houses are occupied in  
 the main by local inhabitants,whilst  
 the people who have recently moved to 
 the area tend to live in the newer    
 properties.                           
  Of the 64 adults who live in Boldron 
 10 are retired people.23 children make
 up the total population of 87 persons.
 The largest family contains six people
 and the average family numbers four.  
  Newcomers mix very well.They attend  
 church and join in local activities.  </content>
