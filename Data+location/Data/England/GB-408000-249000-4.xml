		<content> Nothing more was recorded until the   
 farm was auctioned in September l920, 
 when it was quoted as a substantially 
 built residence and an excellent set  
 of farm buildings together with a     
 thriving fir plantation of about      
 eighteen years growth known as Campden
 Gap Coppice, extending to fifteen     
 acres.  The total farm area amounted  
 to one hundred and forty two acres and
 was let on an annual tenancy of One   
 hundred and twenty five pounds. The   
 present complex was built in l970,    
 when the original farmhouse was       
 divided into two dwellings, and five  
 units were built from the outbuildings
 which were then joined together by    
 three new dwellings, and together with
 the garaging, the whole forms a       
 square.
