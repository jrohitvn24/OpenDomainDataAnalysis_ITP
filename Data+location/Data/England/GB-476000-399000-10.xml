		<title>10EMMA'S DAY IN HAXEY</title>
		<content>  A day in the life of an 11 year-old. 
    I like Saturdays they,for me,are   
 the best day of my week.I always have 
 a good time then.I'm now going to tell
 you about one Saturday in my life.    
     When I wake up,I usually read for 
 a while.One of my hobbies is          
 reading.I've quite a few hobbies.They 
 are reading,writing,cycling and       
 dancing.At about 8.00am,mum and dad   
 wake up.They just talk about various  
 things and eventually decide to get   
 up.Bruce,my naughty little            
 brother,will nearly always get out a  
 car or two,and play baddies running   
 away from goodies.                    
       It is usually about 8.45am      
 before I decide to get out of bed,well
 unwillingly crawl out of bed."Are we  
 going to town today,mum?"I shout."No, 
 not today",mum'll answer."And don't   
 shout,your not still in the school    </content>
