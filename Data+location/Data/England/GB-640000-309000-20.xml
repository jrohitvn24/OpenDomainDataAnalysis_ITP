		<title>20THE CHURCH KEY</title>
		<content> ST EDMUND'S,ACLE,LIKE MANY OLD        
 CHURCHES,POSSESSES A HUGE MEDIAEVAL   
 KEY WHICH UNLOCKS THE FRONT DOOR.     
 IN THE PAST,SHOULD A LOCAL COUPLE     
 BE UNABLE TO AFFORD A WEDDING RING,OR 
 SHOULD THE BEST MAN FORGET TO BRING   
 ONE TO THE CEREMONY,THEN THE BRIDE'S  
 FINGER WAS SLIPPED THROUGH THE KEY    
 INSTEAD.IN 1930 A YOUNG COUPLE (MUCH  
 TO THE DISAPPROVAL OF THE GIRL'S      
 FATHER) ANNOUNCED THEIR INTENTION OF  
 MARRYING.THE FATHER,BEING WELL-AWARE  
 OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE KEY,REMOVED
 IT FROM THE CHURCH.FOR 37 YEARS ITS   
 WHEREABOUTS REMAINED A MYSTERY NO-ONE 
 COULD SOLVE,UNTIL FINALLY IT WAS      
 DISCOVERED AT BRISTON CHURCH IN NORTH 
 NORFOLK AND RETURNED TO ACLE.         
 (PRESUMABLY TO THE RELIEF OF THE STILL
 UNMARRIED COUPLE!)                    
                                       
                                       </content>
