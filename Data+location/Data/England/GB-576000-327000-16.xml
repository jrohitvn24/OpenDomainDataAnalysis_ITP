		<title>16A GAMEKEEPER-HOUGHTON ESTATE</title>
		<content> Although now a contracting industry on
 this estate, game shooting is still   
 important.The estate employs 2 keepers
 and provides enough gamebirds for 8-1O
 guns (each paying Â£1OOO per annum)at 9
 shoots a year.Each shoot takes roughly
 15O brace, most of the bag is sold to 
 a local game-dealer to help offset the
 enormous cost of rearing, feeding and 
 protecting the birds.The keeper buys  
 day old partridge and pheasant chicks 
 to rear under gas lamps, gradually    
 they are moved to outside pens and    
 finally released but still fed        
 regularly. A vital part of the keepers
 job is to protect the game from vermin
 and poachers.Fox ,stoat, weasels,grey 
 squirrel &amp; magpies all prey on        
 gamebirds.Although he liases with     
 neighbouring keepers,his is a solitary
 life spending long hours listening and
 watching, alert to the signs of nature</content>
