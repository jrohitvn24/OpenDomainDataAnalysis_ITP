		<content>   I joined{Marlow Rugby Club}when I   
 was nine back in 1982. I have been    
 going for about three years. At first 
 I played in the 'B' team, which is the
 second team, but when I got better I  
 was promoted to the 'A' team.         
    We train on Sundays from 10.00am   
 till 12.00pm. In training we do lots  
 of different exercises to improve our 
 strength and coordination. Sometimes  
 we play matches.                      
    I have five medals for rugby and   
 lots of certificates.                 
    In a rugby team there are nine     
 players, that is because I play       
 mini-rugby.                           
    Next season I play 15 a side Rugby.
 Rugby is a great game and I like it   
 very much. In mini-rugby they play    
 seven minutes each way, but they play 
 forty minutes in each half in the full
 game.                                 </content>
