		<content> There has been a{Post Office}in the   
 village for 70 years. Mary Bugg has   
 been{postmistress}for 10 years.       
 Thursdays are the busiest days as     
{pensions}are collected and there      
 are a lot of casual customers.        
                                       
 Usually the mornings are busiest. The 
 Post Office opens at 9.30 and closes  
 at 5.30, with a break for lunch at 12 
 noon.                                 
                                       
 Mrs Bugg has seen changes in the      
 job of the postmistress.{Child        
{allowances}and{pensions}have increased
 and the{DHSS}strike of 1984 caused    
 much extra work.                      
                                       
 The building has not always been a    
 Post Office. Poultry and pigs were    
 once kept there.
