		<title>01 THE EASTERN AREA</title>
		<content>My name is Therese.Thank you for       
selecting our area. I live in part of  
the eastern development of Northampton 
known as Thorplands. It is fairly new. 
There is a big shopping precinct called
Tesco's in the Weston Favell Centre,   
close to where I live. Near the Centre 
is a church called the "Sacred Heart"  
which is shaped like a pyramid. The    
priests live downstairs. There is also 
a community hall and a large upper     
school for pupils aged between 13 and  
18 years. Part of that school is known 
as Lings forum which is a community    
sports and recreational centre. Not far
from where I live is Billing Aquadrome.
Here there is a big fair with lots of  
rides and things to do. Recently, they 
have built a large swimming pool.I like
where I live.
