		<title>13A Boy's Home Life</title>
		<content> On Wednesday 5th June my brother got  
 up at about 5 o'clock as usual, fell  
 off his top bunk and yelled  his head 
 off and woke us all up in the process.
 In about five minutes he was charging 
 round the house,watching television,  
 eating breakfast,and jumping up and   
 down on his teddy bear.When we got to 
 school Jenny and I watered our plants 
 and went indoors . Then we got our    
 swimming kit and went swimming.
