		<content>   At last they found a patch of       
 land.It was going to be a fire station
 but when they built one in Telford the
 idea was scrapped.The scouts and      
 guides asked if they could use the    
 land and the county council agreed.   
   But they needed Â£26,000 in order    
 to build the hut.They began all sorts 
 of fund raising such as coffee morning
 bazaars(one Christmas bazaar raised   
 Â£900!).They had a sponsored cycle ride
 down the newly built M54 before it was
 opened.A cub leader Mrs.Lowe made lots
 of furry animals and Christmas cards  
 to be sold at fetes and bazaars.They  
 were given Â£6,000 by the council and  
 other small charities.In April 1982   
 they started building the hut.The     
 building was used for the guides 75th 
 birthday party.The building should be 
 ready by 1986.
