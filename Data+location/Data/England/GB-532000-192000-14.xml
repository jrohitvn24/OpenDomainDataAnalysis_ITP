    I am looking forward to Secondary  
 School because you can make new       
 friends and see new teachers. I also  
 like it because you have to go to     
 different classrooms for different    
 subjects.My favourite subject is      
 cookery because I like making food.I  
 go to Latymer by two buses and as my  
 brother goes to that school I can go  
 with him. Latymer is a large school,I 
 will not be able to find my way around
 for the first week. I am the only     
 person going to Latymer this year so I
 will have to make a lot of new        
 friends. In the first year I will be  
 learning German and in the second year
 I will be learning German.
