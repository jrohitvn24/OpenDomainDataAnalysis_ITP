  There is a close village community in
Harlestone and Church Brampton and it  
was evident in the surveys carried out,
that local people enjoyed the friendly 
atmosphere.                            
  New residents are welcomed as a way  
of maintaining the population and      
therefore the existence of the villages
but have the usual "reservations".     
                                       
{SOCIAL CONCERNS}                      
  There are plans to build a new golf  
course in Harlestone if planning       
permission is granted.Despite creating 
more employment it could also cause the
eviction of some people.               
  There are suggestions by the council 
to open a disused quarry for tipping.  
The Parish Council and residents of    
Harlestone are worried about problems  
from vermin and "fly tipping".         </content>
