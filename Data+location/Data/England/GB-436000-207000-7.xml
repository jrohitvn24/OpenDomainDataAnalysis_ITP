		<title>07Langel Common</title>
		<content> Langel Common is the sretch of land   
between the two branches of the river  
Windrush. The river separates Witney   
from Cogges. In ancient times Langel   
Common was called Witta's Island.The   
river branches here and almost joins   
up again soon after Langel Common.     
There used to be a forded crossing     
just up river from here .In ancient    
times anyone could graze his cattle on 
the common.In the future, Cogges will  
probably end up as part of Witney but  
now, on the Common, there is just a    
wild area. It is very unusual and very 
pleasant to have such a natural area   
so close to the centre of a town. The  
area is used by residents for walking  
and sometimes as a picnic area. Along  
the river banks are willow trees which 
have been pollarded. Wild flowers,     
shrubs and meadow grasses grow. There  
are wild swans and ducks on the river. </content>
