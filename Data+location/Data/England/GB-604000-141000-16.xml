		<title>16MERSHAM HATCH ESTATE 2</title>
		<content>The Estate Manager gave us his typical 
day:-"I get up at 0615 and visit the   
first dairy.Then it is into the Office 
to plan the day's work until breakfast 
time at 0830.After breakfast back to   
the Office to arrange meetings and deal
with post until 1030. I visit the other
two dairies and look over the young    
stock until lunch.Between 1530 and 1730
there are meetings and appointments.   
After that I deal with the arable side 
of the farm including more interviews  
until 1930.On the rounds of the farm I 
drive a Land Rover with radio contact  
to people in key positions.I sometimes 
miss being able to do some of the jobs 
such as ploughing or combining"        
There is a wide variety of crops grown.
Cereals form the bulk of the income    
after milk.Crops include:Winter wheat, 
barley and oats;dried peas,vining peas 
and oil-seed rape as break crops:      </content>
