		<content>     Entered in the Domesday Book of   
 1086 as Morehusum ({Houses on the     
{moor}). The character has changed very
 little since the 19th. century due to 
 by-passing road links.  The former    
 Station Hotel is a reminder of the    
 1860-1900 ironstone mining boom in the
 area. It was built to cater for       
 expected trade from the proposed      
 Cleveland Extension Mineral Railway,  
 known locally as Paddy Waddell's      
 Railway.  The name being derived from 
 its contractor, John Waddell and his  
 Irish engineer (Gallaher). The        
 railway, with the intended ironstone  
 mining along its route from Kilton to 
 Glaisdale, could have brought about   
 social and economic changes to        
 Moorsholm. The work was never finished
 due to lack of public funding.        
 Evidence of cuttings and embankments  
 still remains.                        </content>
