		<title>03GENERAL SURVEY RAVENGLASS</title>
		<content> This area lies on the Cumbrian coastal
 strip between the Irish sea and the   
 central massif of the Lake District   
 National Park in which the area is    
 included. Ravenglass,built at the     
 junction of the estuaries of the Irt, 
 Mite and Esk,has been a settlement    
 since Roman times and is still the    
 main village for the area.Farming and 
 tourism are important as sources of   
 income and employment,but the main    
 employer is British Nuclear Fuels at  
 Sellafield and contractors on that    
 site.The village school was closed in 
 1981 and the Primary school children  
 are now bussed to Waberthwaite school 
 (5mls).Secondary school children      
 travel to Millom Comprehensive(15mls).
 The climate is warm and wet.The       
 estuary forms an excellent harbour    
 used by many small boats.
