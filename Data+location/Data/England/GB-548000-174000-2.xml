		<title>02BEXLEYHEATH TRANSPORT (RAIL)</title>
		<content> The Bexleyheath railway opened in 1895
 as part of the North Kent line built  
 by South Eastern Railway.  Travellers 
 in the 1890's would have seen wide    
 open spaces with a few houses dotted  
 about. They would also have seen the  
 farm labourers working in the orchards
 and glass houses. People travelling   
 from Bexleyheath in the 1980's see a  
 very different scene. Houses,gardens, 
 shops, offices and factories have     
 developed along the line. Most of the 
 open space has gone.  Most of the     
 train passengers are travelling       
 towards London for work or shopping.  
 The journey takes about 35 minutes.   
 Although many people are satisfied    
 with the service, others wanted to see
 cleaner and more comfortable trains.  
 Many people walk to the station but   
 those who drive want larger car parks.
