 THE ENTIRE BLOCK IS MOSTLY ARABLE     
 FARMING.   THERE WAS A PIG FARM UNTIL 
 THIS SUMMER WHEN THE OWNER MOVED TO   
 THE ISLE OF SKYE.   MATTHEW TURKEY    
 FARMS TAKE UP A GOOD PORTION OF THE   
 OLD WARTIME AIRSTRIP AT BEESTON AND AT
 DUNHAM THERE WAS A DAIRY FARM SELLING 
 DAIRY PRODUCE BUT THIS ALSO CLOSED    
 THIS AUTUMN DUE TO THE OWNER MOVING   
 FOR HEALTH REASONS.                   
                                       
 THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR WAS        
 EXTREMELY WET AND HARVEST WAS         
 DIFFICULT AND LATE, GRAIN STARTING TO 
 GROW AGAIN BEFORE CUT, BUT THE LATER  
 MONTHS HAVE BEEN VERY DRY AND THE     
 GROUND HAS BECOME VERY HARD AND ROOT  
 CROPS DIFFICULT TO LIFT.              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
