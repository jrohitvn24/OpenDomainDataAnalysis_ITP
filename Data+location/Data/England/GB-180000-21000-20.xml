 Many people come to Cornwall to       
 retire. Here is an account of one such
 person. I chose this part of Cornwall 
 because it is quiet and has unspoilt  
 country side. I spent many happy      
 holidays in the neighbouring village  
 of Coverack but decided to settle here
 because it is on the level and offers 
 easy access to village shops, church, 
 doctors surgery and the farm for dairy
 produce unlike some of the fishing    
 villages which have very steep hills. 
 St. Keverne is a good starting point  
 for cliff walks which lead down to    
 many isolated coves and well kept     
 National Trust land.  There are       
 disadvantages without a car namely    
 distance to a railway station,        
 airport, hospital, live theatre but   
 this community helps each other and   
 it is a haven of peace after the city.</content>
