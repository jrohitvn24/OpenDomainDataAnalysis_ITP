		<title>13CRAFTS IN L. STAUGHTON</title>
		<content> Traditional{lace making}is still being
 practised in Little Staughton. It is  
 made on a pillow filled either with   
 hay, sawdust, or polystyrene. Cotton  
 is wound on a bobbin with a shank at  
 one end and a spangle made up of seven
 beads at the other, except for the    
 Honiton bobbin which does not have    
 this spangle.Bobbins used to be made  
 of bone (often from the Christmas     
 ham!) but are now usually made of     
 plastic, brass or glass. The pattern  
 is pricked onto the pillow from a     
 parchment and paper pattern which is  
 followed in the actual lace making.   
 People from 8 to 80 years enjoy this  
 ancient craft.                        
{Cake icing and sugar craft}is also    
 practised. Celebratory cakes of all   
 kinds are made. They are richly       
 decorated with flowers and other      
 motifs.                               </content>
