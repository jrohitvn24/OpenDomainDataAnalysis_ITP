		<title>06Ash Manor.</title>
		<content>   Ash Manor dates back to the original
 Domesday Book. The building which     
 stands today dates from Elizabethan   
 times although some of the original   
 foundations still stand today. It is  
 possible that monks from St. Peter's  
 Church lived there for some time      
 although the manor was not a          
 monastery. Later the local squire     
 would have lived there. The manor is  
 now owned by Mr and Mrs Smith who have
 lived there for 6 years. Surrounding  
 this beautiful beamed building is the 
 original moat. It is about 3 metres   
 wide and 2 metres deep. Beside the    
 moat grows a yew tree which is        
 believed to be about 500 years old.   
 There is a theory that one of the     
 fields belonging to the manor might   
 have been the village green and could 
 have been the origin of the name Ash  
 Green which is the name of the area.  </content>
