		<content> We are very lucky in our school to    
 have games painted on our playground. 
 These are a few of the games  we play.
 Evaporation,Snake,Hopscotch and       
 Rocket.Our favourite game is called   
 Ladybird.There is a painted Ladybird  
 but with numbers instead of coloured  
 spots.One person is on and the other  
 people stand on a number.The person   
 who is on turns around and the others 
 run around till the person on shouts  
 STOP!Then they each stand on a number.
 One of the people who are on the      
 numbers shouts out the numbers on     
 which the people are standing.        
 Supposing you were standing on 6 and  
 the person called out 6 you have to   
 run and touch the wall and get back   
 before they touch you.If they touch   
 you you become on,if they don't touch 
 you,they stay on.
