		<title>04The Hamlet of Sewards End</title>
		<content>  The square consists mainly of the    
 hamlet of Sewards End.Gates, the      
 agricultural suppliers (tractor sales 
 and repairs), a sub Post Office in the
 local shop,The Green Dragon Pub with a
 beer garden and an unusual {Chapel}   
 where you can only be christened and  
 buried (not married) are the main     
 non-residential buildings. Many people
 were out on the day we called (a      
 Tuesday) as some had gone to market in
 Saffron Walden and others are         
 commuters.Those residents who did talk
 to us had either just moved in or had 
 lived there for up to sixty years.Some
 wished for a bigger shop, and others  
 for a childrens' playground.
