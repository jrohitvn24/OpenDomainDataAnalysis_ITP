		<title>03AMUSING OURSELVES</title>
		<content> To keep ourselves amused in 1985,these
 are some of the things we do.         
 We play games on the computer or type 
 things in and invent our own games.   
 Sometimes we just watch the television
 or video.We like listening to pop     
 music.We like going to disco's.Disco  
 is the shortened word for discotheque.
 At the disco people dance to the      
 records the disc jockey plays.There   
 are lights flashing round in different
 colours and sometimes there are       
 pictures.Some girls go to guides and  
 boys go to scouts.They learn to cook  
 on open fires and to camp in          
 tents.There are brownies, beavers     
 and cubs for younger children and     
 rangers and ventures for older        
 children.Some people go to the        
 swimming baths to swim.There are two  
 baths in the area.
