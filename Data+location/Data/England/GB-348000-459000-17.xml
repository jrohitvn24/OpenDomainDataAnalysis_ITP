People interviewed were:               
Mark Doggett aged 10, his grandmother  
and his great-grandmother age 91.      
Both Mark's nana and great-nana like   
living in Lancaster because of the     
interesting buildings. His grandma     
dislikes the waste and the litter. His 
great-grandma dislikes the weather.    
The greatest change they have seen is  
in the landscape. When they were young 
there were fields where now there are  
houses and offices. Mark's nana said   
that when she was young she used to    
have a bath in a tub in front of the   
fire. Instead of an electric blanket   
or hot-water bottle, they had a pan    
with hot coals in it which they put in 
the bed. Mark goes to school every     
day. In his spare time he plays with   
his friends and with his computer.
