		<title>17EMPLOYMENT SURVEY</title>
		<content>   The employment survey took place in 
 two different places:- Ickenham and   
 Denham.                               
    ICKENHAM: We found that in Ickenham
 more people tended to be in           
 professional jobs i.e.:- teachers,    
 doctors and businessmen. They tended  
 to be higher earners than in Denham,  
 and in Ickenham not many women worked.
 We also found that in Ickenham more   
 people commuted to London than in     
 Denham.                               
    DENHAM: We found that more people  
 in were employed as drivers or        
 builders etc... and far more women    
 worked. Also in Denham there were far 
 more people unemployed.{
