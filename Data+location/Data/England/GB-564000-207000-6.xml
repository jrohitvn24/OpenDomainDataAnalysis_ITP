		<title>06BRITISH GAS SECURITY</title>
		<content> There is a British Gas compression    
 plant on the Roxwell Road about a     
 mile from the village of Roxwell. The 
 security is very tight all the way    
 around the place. Magic eyes are      
 everywhere and some of them you cannot
 see. At the gate there is a speaker so
 you can talk into it and let the      
 guards know who you are and your      
 reason for entering the plant.There   
 is also a video camera which looks    
 down at the gate so the guards can se 
 who is there. Even if you did manage  
 to get over the fence two dogs would  
 get you. Just in front of the gate    
 there is a beam which you cannot see  
 so when you walk through it an alarm  
 goes off in the building. In case of  
 emergencies there are two of          
 everything, leaving one on standby.
