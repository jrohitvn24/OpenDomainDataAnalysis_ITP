		<content> There are plenty of leather shops in  
 Cornwall but there is only one        
 leather shop in St.Merryn.We          
 interviewed Peter a craftsman who     
 ownes the leather shop.Peter started  
 making and selling leather in 1980 .  
 He started making leather because he  
 needed a job and he had been offered  
 one working in leather .              
 Last year apart from his leather      
 job he worked in a meat factory.He    
 makes his own leather goods but he    
 buys already tanned skins.Peter makes 
 belts and key rings.Peter uses cowhide
 leather.He sells his leather goods in 
 St.Merryn .He knows two other people  
 who sell their own crafts.They are    
 Mr.Rutherford at Harvose and Mr Roddis
 at Rainbows end.The sort of tools he  
 uses are knifes,stamps,hole           
 punches,stain,plyers,mallets,needles  
 and thread.                           </content>
