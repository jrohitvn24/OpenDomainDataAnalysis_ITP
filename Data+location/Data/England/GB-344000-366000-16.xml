 prevailing south westerly winds, mild 
 because of the influence of the Gulf  
 stream and protection of the Pennines.

 populace and is generally good.       
{POLLUTION}No direct pollution occurs  
 in this given area, however water     
 supplies from the River Dee at Chester
 have been polluted, occasionally to   
 dangerous levels by industry upstream.
 Also Petrochemical industry at        
 Ellesmere Port emits waste which      
 effects the area when prevailing wind 
 drops.

 and are served by general provision   
 shops. Several businesses have their  
 origins in agriculture, a freezer     
 centre, horse drawn carriages &amp; an    
 agricultural supplier.
