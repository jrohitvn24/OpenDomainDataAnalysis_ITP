		<title>05St Annes - Housing</title>
		<content>     Third year pupils gathered        
 information to assess the houses in   
 the St Annes and Ansdell area.        
 Information was obtained from property
 magazines and by surveying maps of the
 area                                  
     The property on South Park has    
 been built in the last 20 years.It    
 caters for both young and old and has 
 easy access to Lytham and St          
 Annes.Property in Ansdell varies in   
 age and style.The houses nearest to St
 Annes are more modern than those on   
 Commonside,some of which date from the
 late 19th century.                    
      The biggest and most expensive   
 property is on Clifton Drive and the  
 Inner Promenade.These vary in age but 
 all have many rooms and large gardens.
