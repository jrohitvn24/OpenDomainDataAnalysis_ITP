		<content>   In l960 Christopher Booth, then aged
 16, drove his first Morgan 3-wheeler  
 car.  So began a hobby which grew     
 until he now has probably the best    
 collection of these cars in the world.
 Passing tourists and enthusiasts from 
 many countries come to visit the{Motor
{Museum}which he has built behind his  
 antique shop in the High Street.      
   As well as the 10 Morgan cars, most 
 of which he drives regularly, he has  
 other motor vehicles, motorcycles,    
 bicycles and toy cars on display. The 
 museum was opened in 1972 and Mr Booth
 is still busy renovating Morgan cars. 
   He found one car in the attic of a  
 London house, with the engine and     
 chassis in the spare bedroom! Mr Booth
 has to build many of the spare parts  
 himself. In one case he had to build a
 replica body for one car which had    
 been left out for nearly 40 years.    </content>
