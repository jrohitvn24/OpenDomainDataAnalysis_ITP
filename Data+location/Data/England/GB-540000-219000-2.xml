		<content>   The 4 X 3km block does not encompass
 the whole of Much Hadham but runs     
 North of the Primary school, along the
 drive of Moor Place (dated 1775) to   
 Hadham Ford south of Little Hadham. It
 encompasses the hamlets of Wellpond   
 Green and Westland Green. It is       
 predominantly an agricultural area of 
 intensive farming, mainly arable, with
 high return cash crops.               
   The land cover is open fields,      
 meadows and woodlands, with many      
 desirable residences dotted about.    
 About 150 years ago, because of easy  
 access to London, Much Hadham became  
 very popular as a weekend retreat for 
 the wealthy London merchants. They    
 came and built fine houses in and     
 around the village.
