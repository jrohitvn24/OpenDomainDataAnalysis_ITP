		<content> Most housewives work part_time and    
 only on a couple of days.My Mum gets  
 up at 6.00am,makes my packed lunch,my 
 brother's dinner and my Dad's.She     
 catches the bus at about 7.00am.My Mum
 doesn't get home until about 3.00pm.  
 When she does get home she has to cook
 the tea and then wash the dishes.She  
 doesn't sit down until about 7.30pm.  
 My Dad is an architect.He works every 
 day of the week including Sunday and  
 he only stops when we go on holiday.  
 My brother has to go to college for a 
 week then go on to work.To get a good 
 job nowadays you need to get O levels 
 when you're 16,A levels when you're   
 18 and spend 3 years at college.      
 There are{3,000,000}people unemployed 
 in England.
