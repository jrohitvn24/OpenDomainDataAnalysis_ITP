		<title>05FARMING: LAVENDERS FARM</title>
		<content> The Common Market milk quota limits   
 the number of cows, mainly Jersey     
 breed, to 35 on this dairy farm. An   
 Aberdeen Angus bull is also kept.     
 Electric fences divide the fields to  
 control the grazing. The soil is sandy
 and soon dries out.                   
     Behind the 150 year old farm house
 is a diesel-pump well, 15 feet deep,  
 which is used regularly. Two swans    
 Beatrice and Benedict, live in the    
 pond at the end of the orchard. The   
 farmer, Mr. Whitehead, has planted    
 about 2000 trees on his farm. He and  
 his wife promote conservation.        
     Interesting features include a 500
 year old stone barn, a 4th Century    
 B.C. statue of a man, the site of the 
 former village butt and the drained   
 millrace.
