		<content> This block is very much rural in      
 aspect and traditional employment was 
 previously associated with farming and
 coal mining. Through mechanization job
 opportunities in the former have de_  
 creased whilst mining has all but van_
 ished. The majority in work now travel
 to the nearby towns of Spennymoor and 
 B.Auckland. Even here opportunities   
 are limited. For the young this seems 
 especially true. The following data on
 unemployment was given by the REGIONAL
 MANPOWER INTELLIGENCE UNIT, Newcstle _
 on_Tyne (Tel. 0632 326181).

 able for this block any improvement   
 in job vacancies must come not from   
 traditional industries but new ones.  </content>
