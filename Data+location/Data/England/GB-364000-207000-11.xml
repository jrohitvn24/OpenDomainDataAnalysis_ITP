		<title>11SHEEP IN THE FOREST</title>
		<content>   In the Forest of Dean sheep         
 wander around freely on the roads, in 
 the woods and picnic sites and        
 sometimes into people's gardens ! The 
 sheep are very useful because they    
 keep the grass down and prevent paths 
 from getting overgrown. Sometimes     
 sheep stray on to the road and cause  
 accidents so please drive carefully.  
 When you go into the forest please    
 keep your dogs on a lead because some 
 dogs chase sheep. This is called sheep
 worrying. The people that keep sheep  
 in the forest are called ship (sheep) 
 badgers; they are members of the      
 Commoners' Association and they have  
 had sheep in their families for       
 generations. The ship badgers each    
 have a different identification mark  
 for their sheep which makes them      
 sometimes appear very colourful !
