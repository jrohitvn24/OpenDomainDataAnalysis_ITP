		<title>08TUNNEL CEMENT W.THURROCK.</title>
		<content>    To develop the Lakeside area it has
 been necessary to demolish the old    
 cement factories that were already    
 there as part of the site.            
  My uncle worked in the Tunnel Estate,
 but in 1935 when he first worked there
 it was called the Tunnel Cement.He    
 helped to build the tall chimneys up  
 to 550ft tall, also the kiln          
 foundations and slurry basins used in 
 the making of cement. He also worked  
 in other factories so he was not at   
 the Tunnel all the time.He worked     
 there on and off until he retired.He  
 is now 76.He usually worked in a gang 
 of about 12 men,working only the      
 dayshift.                             
 He wore overalls and boots for work   
 and went to work on his bicycle. He   
 enjoyed his work.
