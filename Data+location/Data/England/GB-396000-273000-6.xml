 The building of the M42 has created   
 problems:the destruction of beautiful 
 countryside and traffic chaos. The    
 building of the A38 interchange has   
 delayed much of the traffic on this   
 main road.                            
{M5                                    
 The widening of the{M5}has caused     
 delays.Many diversions have been put  
 up to bypass the roadworks.At stages  
 the motorway has been closed          
 completely.                           
{Marlbrook Landfill Site               
 This has caused a lot of distress.The 
 lorries trundling up and down         
 Alvechurch Highway are damaging the   
 roads with their weight.Also the      
 vibrations damage houses as the       
 lorries go past and cause noise       
 nuisance.
