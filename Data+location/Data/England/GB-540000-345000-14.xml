		<title>14Ecology(4) in Leverton</title>
		<content> The whole of our area,including the   
 outmarsh,is used for shooting,both    
 wildfowling and game,and many birds   
 are shot,deliberately or by mistake,  
 which should not be shot.Pheasants and
 partridges are reared for shooting and
 the only vermin now disposed of are   
 foxes and rats.Pesticides,however,are 
 responsible for other "accidental"    
 disappearances.Butterflies are now not
 as common as they once were because   
 their food supply is no longer allowed
 to grow as it used to do.Only one     
 small patch of phragmites reed still  
 grows and has a small breeding        
 population of sedge warblers.Frogs and
 toads are non-existent but newts can  
 still be found in one or two places.  
 Progress in farming methods have their
 casualties and not all progress has   
 been for the better,particularly for  
 the wildlife.                         </content>
