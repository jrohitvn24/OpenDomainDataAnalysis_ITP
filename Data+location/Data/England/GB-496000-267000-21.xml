<title>21update on the tearful bouquet presenter</title>
<content>

My daughter was this lucky girl. I remember our mobile hairdress arriving very early. My daughter chose not to wear school uniform. We had a lovely day choosing her outfit A tammygirl pink 2piece. I made her some pink lace gloves which managed to get tangled up in with the queen, my daughter, and the bouquet. I did not see much of it at all as I was at the back of the crowd someone put the 2yr old with me on their shoulders so she could see the queen. She cannot remember what the queen said to her just that everybody was very kind. I was given a photo taken by one of my daughters friends it as been on my dinning room wall ever since. When my daughter came home from school a few weeks before the queens visit she asked me, 'Mum what does the queen get everywhere she goes?' I nearly died when she finally told me. Thanks Domesday for the memory.   &lt;br />
