		<content>__Cont.-I have a small garden with a   
pond with fish in.There are quite a lot
of factories East-the-Water like A.M.P.
Leisure Industries,Atlas and toy factor
-ies along the Alverdiscott Rd.There   
are some lovely country lanes leading  
to Weare Giffard,Torrington and Barnsta
-ple.The Kingsley Hospital for mentally
handicapped people is just along the   
road.The most popular place to walk to 
is the reservoir(Gammaton)where you can
swim.At the Community Centre in Avon   
Lane there are some swings and slides  
and a B.M.X.track.Near where I live    
there are, a wool-shop,a newsagents,a  
greengrocers and a clothes shop.A bit  
further down the road there is a fish  
and chip shop and an off-licence.(th-  
ough these are just out of the area).  
The next account of home-life East-the-
Water, is from a short distance away by
an older girl with help from a friend. </content>
