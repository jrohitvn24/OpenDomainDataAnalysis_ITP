		<content>{Carlton House}is an{Old People's Home.
 There are rooms for{forty residents;  
 there are{7 men and 33 women.}The     
 oldest person is 96 and the youngest  
 69. In the Home there are 3 sitting   
 rooms, 1 dining room, lots of         
 bedrooms and bathrooms; most of the   
 bedrooms are shared by 2 people. The  
 house has a lift as well as stairs.   
 Most of the residents like the Home   
 and have lots of friends; quite a few 
 of the old people use walking frames  
 and some are deaf. They play Bingo    
 every 2 months. The residents pay{part
{of their State Pension}to live at the 
 Home. Family and friends come to visit
 them; they get presents at Christmas  
 but just cards on their birthdays. I  
 think that old people's homes are a   
 good idea but{I don't want to live in 
{one when I get old.
