		<content>   When asked what, if anything, made  
 them come into Thorney during         
{holiday-times}or{week-ends, shopping  
 was the main reason given. Those that 
 lived nearest the village occasionally
 cycled in to{play}with their friends, 
 but none of them came in to the       
{library.}Visits to the{doctor}were the
 only other reason. The{dykes}were the 
 main playground of the children, with 
 some enjoying playing in the{fields.  
 Most of them have brothers or sisters 
 to play with, or another youngster    
 within a mile or two of their house.  
 The one advantage they all agreed on  
 was that it was{peaceful!
