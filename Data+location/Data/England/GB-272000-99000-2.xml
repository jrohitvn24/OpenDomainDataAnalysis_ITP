		<content>{Bow}is situated half way between      
 Crediton and Okehampton.The village   
 name comes from Bow Bridge over the   
 River Yeo-the word means that the     
 bridge is built of round stones not   
 flat ones used for clapper bridges.The
 village comprises one main street,the 
 sites having been occupied since the  
 time of{WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR.}Many   
 houses are named after former         
 occupants such as Tozers and Godfreys.
 The villagers were employed in        
 agriculture and the Tannery which for 
 150 years,until 1887,was a thriving   
 industry.Two mounds by the road near  
 Bow Bridge were erected over the      
 bodies of men who died in a skirmish  
 between Parliamentary Forces and the  
 Royal troops in 1643.On 29th July 1644
 Charles I left Crediton and slept in  
 Bow for a night before going on to    
 Okehampton.                           </content>
