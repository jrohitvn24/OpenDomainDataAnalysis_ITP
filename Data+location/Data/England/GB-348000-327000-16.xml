		<title>16The Story of Wem Baths</title>
		<content>   There is a swimming pool in Wem down
 Bowen's Field.The local people had the
 idea of building it in 1969. Many     
 clubs and individuals helped raise the
 money over a period of five years. The
 pool is 25 metres long and 10 metres  
 wide. The Wem Town Council took over  
 the pool in 1974 because it was  so   
 expensive to run. Everyone in Wem has 
 been upset to see it shut after their 
 hard work.It shut in 1982 because it  
 had a very poor flat roof and water   
 came in rusting the metal beams. It   
 was a long time before anyone spotted 
 this so eventually the whole roof     
 needed replacing. This has been an    
 expensive job, costing many times more
 than the original building,and the    
 architects and council still have not 
 been able to agree who is responsible.
 It has taken over 3 years to put right
 but should open in August this year.  </content>
