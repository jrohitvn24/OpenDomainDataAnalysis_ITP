 rural,consisting mainly of farmland or
 woodland. A large proportion of the   
 land belongs to the{Chatsworth Estate 
 of the Duke of Devonshire.            
      Parts of three settlements are   
 included in the area, namely{Whaley,  
{Upper Langwith}and{Hillstown.         
      The main industry of the area    
 tends to be{farming}or services       
 associated with{agriculture}but there 
 is also a{limestone quarry}near       
 Whaley. The nature of the area is     
 slowly changing as a number of farms  
 have been split up and sold.

 area is the building of a{community
