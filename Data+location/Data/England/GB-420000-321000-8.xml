		<title>08A REDUNDANCY CASE IN BURTON</title>
		<content>   A local man worked for a cold-store 
company as a  labourer. He and three   
others from a work-force of fourteen   
were given one week's notice of        
redundancy, because the firm had very  
few orders. They got no redundancy     
pay because they had not enough        
service to qualify.                    
   He lived on social security and     
unemployment benefit, applied for nine 
jobs, and luckily got one in three     
weeks. His family suffered little in   
this time, but his social life was 'cut
in half', and he thought the future was
bleak.                                 
   He blames the Government for his    
lay-off, and says, "They don't concern 
themselves with England, but think of  
other countries like the Falklands and 
Ireland".
