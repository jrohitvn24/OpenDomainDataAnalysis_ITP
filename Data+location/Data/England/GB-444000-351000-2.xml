		<title>02A CHILD'S DAY AT HOME</title>
		<content>   My name is Gaynor. I am a girl aged 
 11. At 7.30 am I get up, dress, have a
 wash and clean my teeth. Then I go    
 downstairs and put my dog outside and 
 feed her. At 7.45 I get my baby sister
 Isobel up and give her something to   
 eat. At 8.00 I check that Gabrielle,  
 my other sister is awake. At 8.35     
 Gabrielle and I set off for school. It
 is a 15 minute walk.                  
   We return from school at 4.00 pm and
 for 30 minutes we have to tidy our    
 bedrooms. Then we have to help mum for
 another 30 minutes. After that we can 
 play. When our mum is at work in the  
 evening we have to go to stay with our
 grandma. Dad collects us from there at
 7.15 pm. When we arrive home I put the
 baby to bed. Mum gets home about an   
 hour later. Then we have a drink and  
 Gabrielle goes to bed. I go to bed at 
 about 10.00pm.That is 30 minutes later</content>
