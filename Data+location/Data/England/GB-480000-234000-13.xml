		<title>13Farming Shenley &amp; Whaddon</title>
		<content> There are 12 farms in the area, of    
 which only one , Shenley Dens Farm is 
 outside the area controlled by the    
 Milton Keynes Development Corporation 
 which now owns all the other farms.   
 Future development plans for the area 
 cover the eastern half of our grid    
 square, although the farms affected   
 still expect to be working for the    
 next 2 years at least. Farming shows a
 mixture of types. About half the area 
 is down to cereal crops with only one 
 known field of vegetables. The        
 remaining land is used for grazing,   
 either intensively or for rough       
 grazing and there are both dairy and  
 beef cattle to be found &amp; sheep. Quite
 a few of the farm buildings are very  
 old. Westbury farm in particular has  
 as its front door a ship's door dating
 from the time of the Spanish Armada,  
 and has the remains of a moat.        </content>
