		<title>02WILD LIFE AROUND GRAFTON</title>
		<content> Temple Grafton is a quiet village and 
 it is not very large but it has plenty
 of wildlife.  At the beginning of     
 Spring celandines start to bud.  Later
 on you can see them looking up to the 
 sky.  Around the middle of Spring     
 daisies become the most common flower,
 and you can see them almost           
 everywhere.  Even later on you can see
 the bright yellow petals of buttercups
 and dandelions.  These two flowers are
 different in the way that their petals
 are set out.  Speedwell is a small    
 light purple flower which spreads     
 across the ground.  It comes out about
 the beginning of summer.  The         
 population of trees in Temple Grafton 
 is quite large.  Plum trees are early 
 in budding so that the plums have time
 to ripen.  The Horse Chestnut has     
 white blossom which is in the shape of
 candles.                              </content>
