		<title>07LIVING AT LOWER HIRST FARM</title>
		<content> My name is Marie Walker and I am ten  
 years old. Our family has lived at    
 Lower Hirst Farm since 1945 but the   
 farm is 200 years old. The farm is on 
 the northern outskirts of Sheffield   
 but inside the city boundary. The     
 fields are on a hillside called Back  
 Edge, above the River Don. There are a
 few cottages around the farm and some 
 of our relatives live there. We don't 
 live far from Parson Cross School     
 where Howard and I go. There is a lot 
 of industry and houses around the     
 farm.                                 
                                       
 The farm covers 42.5 acres, 40 acres  
 for grazing and 2.5 acres for potatoes
 this year. My Dad has his own         
 machinery for mowing, turning and     
 bailing hay. He used to grow crops but
 he said it was a waste because there  
 are too many birds around.            </content>
