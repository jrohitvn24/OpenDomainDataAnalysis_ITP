		<content> There are 15 farms in the block,      
 varying in size from 50 - 250 acres.  
 Of these 12 are owner-occupied and    
 the remainder have different          
 landlords.                            
 These family farms are very self      
 sufficient, none employs outside      
 labour except on a part-time basis.   
 Half have contractors in to make      
 silage, 2 go out silage contracting,  
 and 2 do combining.                   
 They have to buy in concentrates and  
 perhaps beet pulp and barley straw.   
 Some rent summer grazing land.        
 Sons and daughters work on the family 
 farm when they leave school.   They   
 will learn their craft from day       
 courses at the local farm school at   
 Newton Rigg.   The Young Farmers Club 
 will provide both education and a busy
 social life for them up to the age of 
 26.                                   </content>
