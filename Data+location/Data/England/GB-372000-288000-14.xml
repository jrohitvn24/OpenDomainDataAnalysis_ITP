		<title>14FARMING EAST OF THE SEVERN</title>
		<content>  The land here is undulating,rising to
 around 100 metres,with a large amount 
 under forest cover at Dudmaston forest
  Although modern agriculture is now   
 mainly mechanised,hand tillage is     
 still used at one farm in Mose,where  
 hoes are used on land near farm       
 buildings.Farming is mainly arable    
 especilly sugar beet and barley.The   
 fields are between 12_20acres (smaller
 than west), with hawthorn hedges and  
 linked by rough tracks. The gates at  
 each field entrance are iron rather   
 than wood.{                           
{ LODGE FARM}covers 260 acres with     
 crops of onions, cereal, sugar beet,  
 with a main crop of potatoes that are 
 sold to Everest Frozen Foods. There   
 are two types of soil; sandy, which   
 requires fertilizer and silt soil from
 the river. 8.8 million gallons of     
 water are used for irrigation.        </content>
