		<title>03THE SOUTHLAKE AREA</title>
		<content>Fifteen years ago the area which is now
known as Thamesmead was marshland.It   
was a place where bombs could be       
brought for safe disposal and a place  
for gypsy encampments. Much of the     
housing consists of long terraces      
built of large concrete slabs.Many     
have a garage at ground level,with the 
living area above to minimise damage   
in the event of flooding. Also there   
are 12 tower blocks. Most houses can   
be reached by walkways, mainly above   
ground level, leading to Tavy   Bridge 
where the shopping centre is situated. 
Also there is a Police Office,         
Lakeside Health Centre and nearby      
Newacres Library, The social centre is 
the Pyramid Club. There is a scarcity  
of leisure facilities,although man-    
made Southmere Lake is used by anglers,
canoists and yachtsmen.The grassy areas
are unsuitable for football or cricket.</content>
