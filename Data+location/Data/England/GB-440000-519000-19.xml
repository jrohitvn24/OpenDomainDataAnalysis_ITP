		<content> On Friday at school we do L.S.S. which
 stands for life and Social Skills. We 
 do rugby or swimming; rugby is alright
 but swimming is best. Our next lesson 
 is music which I like. It is fun. My  
 next lesson is Humanities, my         
 favourite lesson. Our last lesson is  
 Science and Technology which is       
 alright but I am not very good at it.

 I like television because some        
 programmes or films are exciting. I   
 only watch it when I have the time    
 because I am mostly out. I like sport 
 like rugby, basketball etc. because it
 keeps you fit and it's enjoyable to   
 play. Music I listen to a lot because 
 it is good. I usually listen to The   
 Jam and Style Council because it's the
 music I am into.
