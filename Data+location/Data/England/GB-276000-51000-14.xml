		<title>14ECOLOGY OF HALWELL&amp;MORELEIGH</title>
		<content> For centuries in Halwell and Moreleigh
 farming,wildlife,people and transport 
 have had to exist together,but in 1985
 there is a growing awareness of       
 problems connected with such aspects  
 of rural life as:                     
 1.Stubble burning-now much regulated  
 and discouraged.                      
 2.Silage and other pollution of rivers
 3.Overuse of pesticides and herbicides
 4.The uprooting of ancient hedges and 
 trees.                                
 5.Neglectful and wilful closure of    
 footpaths and ancient rights of way.  
 6. The constant encroachment of the   
 motor vehicle into every aspect of    
 daily life-noise pollution being a    
 particular worry.                     
 7.Indiscriminate and unsuitable       
 development on farm and green belt    
 land.                                 
                                       </content>
