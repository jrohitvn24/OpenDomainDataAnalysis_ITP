		<title>07COMMUNICATIONS at Blindcrake</title>
		<content>   Being a small village most people   
 know each other so "word of mouth" is 
 the favourite medium of communication.
 In the centre of the village is The   
 Notice Board, read by most each day as
 they collect their newspaper from the 
 box underneath where they were left   
 after delivery from Cockermouth.      
   The monthly Church Magazine is taken
 by almost everyone and the Chapel also
 has a notice board.                   
   Travelling shops, almost one a day, 
 and the Library Bus also provide a    
 focal point. There is a public phone  
 in the village but most homes have    
 their own. Postal delivery is once a  
 day and collection from the one box   
 twice a day (Sundays excepted).       
   Television reception can be poor due
 to local hills so most houses have,   
 unfortunately, large aerials.
