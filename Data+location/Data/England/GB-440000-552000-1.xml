		<title>01Ryhope and South Grangetown</title>
		<content> The area of{Ryhope &amp; South Grangetown,
 on the north_east coast, began life as
 a farming community centred on the    
 village of{Ryhope}and{Grange}Farm. The
 earliest written record of settlement 
 is to be found in the Boldon Book of  
 1183.The area was dominated by farming
 until 1859 when{Ryhope Pit}opened. The
 population rose rapidly,leading to the
 expansion of both Ryhope &amp; Grangetown.
 A large{industrial estate}has recently
 emerged at{Leechmere,}near Grangetown}
 (now a suburb of{Sunderland);}but the 
 increase in industrialisation and the 
 emergence of housing estates has not  
 destroyed the beauty of the area.There
 is still plenty of green belt and farm
 land; the beach and the dene are very 
 scenic and{Ryhope Pumping Station}is  
 now a working museum. Even the closure
 of the pit in 1966 has led to the site
 being transformed into a beauty spot. </content>
