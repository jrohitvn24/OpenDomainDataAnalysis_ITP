		<title>07WARMINSTER'S ADVICE CENTRE</title>
		<content>   The Citizen's Advice Bureau was     
 founded in 1939 to help people with   
 war problems. People thought it would 
 fade away but it is still running     
 today, with 900 branches nationwide.  
   The Warminster branch opened in the 
 High Street, behind St Laurence's, in 
 1981. Local Organiser, Mrs Jean Swift,
 who is helped by 15 men and women     
 volunteers, reports that about 15 to  
 20 people come for advice every day.  
   The Bureau deals with all sorts of  
 problems, including social security,  
 consumer complaints, employment,      
 housing and family problems. Staff    
 can consult a "library" of detailed   
 information, and obtain more help from
 Head Office in London. Confidentiality
 is guaranteed: even if the problem    
 involves a law-breaker,the Bureau will
 offer advice, but not divulge clients'
 details without a court subpoena.     </content>
