		<title>15THE WOODHOUSE NEWS</title>
		<content> The Woodhouse News is a free{         
{community newspaper}delivered to every
 household on the large Woodhouse Close
{council estate.}The paper is run by an
 editorial committee from the{Social   
{Services Advice Centre}which occupies 
 two adjoining semi-detached houses on 
 the estate.                           
 The idea for the paper came from the  
 local vicar and a number of people on 
 the estate who felt that the issues   
 facing them were not well enough      
 understood. The{aim of the paper}was  
 to inform everyone of these issues and
 to publicise any events or functions  
 on the estate, as well as the social  
 services available from the Advice    
 Centre. Since 1974 then paper has been
 delivered to{2000 homes every four to 
{six weeks.}The local council provided 
 funds but has now withdrawn them and  
 finance comes from advertising, &amp;c.   </content>
