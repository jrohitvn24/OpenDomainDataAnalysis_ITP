		<content> The local history of the area has been
 dominated by the occupants of         
 Englefield House. They have owned most
 of the land in the area and been      
 actively farming it since the early   
 medieval period. In the 16th century  
 the Englefield family were Roman      
 Catholic recusants and were           
 dispossessed of their estates in the  
 reign of Queen Elizabeth I. A         
 succession of people held the house   
 and the estate until it came into the 
 Benyon family in the 18th century.    
 Since then, and particularly in the   
 19th century, the Benyons were        
 improving landlords. Many of the      
 churches and most of the social clubs 
 in the area were built by the family  
 and they built houses of a very high  
 standard for their workers. The       
 present occupant of Englefield House  
 is William Benyon M.P..               </content>
