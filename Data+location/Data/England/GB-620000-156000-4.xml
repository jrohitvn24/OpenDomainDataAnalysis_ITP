		<content> This is dependant on the type of      
 farming + the way its is carried out. 
 At the NW, bordering Trenley Park     
 Woods has areas of pasture + cereal   
 crops interspersed with patches of    
 woodland. Wild flowers are allowed to 
 grow along verges and hedgerows- Cow  
 Parsely, Wild roses, Clematis,        
 Honeysuckle, Wood anemones, Bluebells 
 and Campions. The orchards are        
 beautiful in blossom time. Many       
 footpaths are confined between fences 
 but trees have been planted for       
 shelter. An area of Pine Wood has been
 replaced by orchard with a fringe by  
 the main road. By the river some of   
 the old water meadows remain, at      
 Seaton, L'bourne Mill + Garrington.   
 Towards Ickham it is more arable +    
 flat, hedges and trees have suffered  
 from stubble burning. The old gravel  
 pits are being recovered for wildlife.</content>
