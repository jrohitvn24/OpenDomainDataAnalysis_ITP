		<title>07HOUSING IN MARTON/NUNTHORPE</title>
		<content> The most numerous type of dwelling, be
 it house or bungalow, appears to be   
 the semi-detached (60% in the survey) 
 followed by detached (31%). A great   
 variety in both design and size of    
 house exists. The largest houses, set 
 in their own grounds, are to be found 
 along Guisborough Rd., Nunthorpe. Many
 of the houses in both Marton and      
 Nunthorpe are of 'open plan' frontage 
 reflecting the housing style of the   
 l970's. As far as building materials  
 go brick is certainly the most used   
 material for house walls (99% of the  
 houses in Marton have brick walls),   
 although there are some recently built
 rough-stone houses at Grey Towers,    
 Nunthorpe. Roofs are predominantly    
 tile (98% in Marton) with some slate  
 on the older houses (2% in Marton). In
 Nunthorpe, near the library, stands a 
 house with a thatched roof.           </content>
