		<content> My school,is a modern open plan       
 school.It has four units upper        
 junior,lower junior,upper infant      
 and lower infant. There are three     
 teachers in every unit and these      
 teachers work as teams in their       
 units.All the teachers teach a        
 wide range of subjects like maths,    
 language,french,science,P.E. and      
 topic.We also do art,story,R.E.and    
 games.The three main subjects are     
 maths,language and topic.The children 
 work in groups or on their own.This   
 means they can work at their own      
 speed.In maths we sit in groups which 
 seperates us from the people who are  
 doing different things.In language    
 we're usually writing a story or      
 poetry, we can sit where we want to.In
 french we learn by having             
  conversations with the teacher and   
 other children.                       </content>
