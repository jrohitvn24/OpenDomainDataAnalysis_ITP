		<title>17Canoeing on the Severn</title>
		<content>    The River Severn at Jackfield and  
 Coalport is used by many canoeists.I  
 belong to Shrewsbury canoe club.The   
 river here is dark brown and quite    
 murky.Its good for canoeing on because
 there are big rapids formed by rocks  
 with water flowing very fast over     
 them.At Jackfield the Severn is       
 flowing at its fastest rate from the  
 mountains to the sea.                 
   We put gates up for slalom          
 courses.These are two wooden poles    
 dangling from wire stretched between  
 the banks about five feet above the   
 water.We wear life-jackets because the
 river is very dangerous with its      
 strong currents,stopper waves and pot 
 holes.
