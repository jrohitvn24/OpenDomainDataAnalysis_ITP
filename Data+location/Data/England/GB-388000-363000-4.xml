		<title>04BUGLAWTON HALL SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Buglawton Hall School used to be a    
 hunting lodge about 400 years         
 ago.People came  to stay the night    
 there when they went hunting at       
 Wildboarclough.Over the years it      
 changed into a farm and then into a   
 hall.In 1950 Manchester City Council  
 bought it and  converted it into   a  
 school for boys with discipline       
 problems.There were two rooms for the 
 butler.They were both small pantries  
 ,and there was a family room.There    
  was a stage on which the family      
 would perform.There were some         
 stables and the groom used to sleep   
 above.Now there are only 6 classrooms 
 in the school.When building is done,  
 it has to be done with the original   
 materials.If it is not the builders   
 are fined.When Manchester bought it,  
 it cost Â£50,000 .Today it would cost  
 about half a million pounds.          </content>
