		<content>   There are several new estates in the
 area.In Brandlesholme, such an estate 
 is the Barratt estate that consists of
 detached individual houses and        
 bungalows, some still under           
 development.Towards Lowercroft there  
 are some recently finished estates.   
 They are expensively priced from      
 Â£45000 to around Â£70000.Just across   
 from our school in Elton, there are   
 some estates that have been recently  
 completed and they will soon be       
 occupied.                             
   The western outskirts of the town   
 are dominated by cottage farm houses. 
 They were built around the early 19th 
 Century.Though some houses still      
 survive from the 1760's.This area is  
 built on the slope of a hill. Here    
 there are compact streets built around
 the 1920's.The area north-west of the 
 town is mainly pre-war terraces.      </content>
