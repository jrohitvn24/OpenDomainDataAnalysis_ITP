		<title>04Mr.Powell, the Forester</title>
		<content> A man called Mr.Powell came to talk to
 us about the Forestry Commission.     
{In the whole of the Forest there are  
{about 27000 acres, 22500 of which are 
{used for timber production. The Forest
{is carefully managed with a balance of
{45% deciduous and 55% coniferous trees
{being maintained.Mr Powell told us the
{trees are a living renewable resource.
 Mr. Powell's job is concerned with    
 recreation, tourism and fencing of old
 mine shafts some of which are 200m    
 deep.He told us about forest fires and
 litter bugs. He said tourists don't   
 leave much litter,but the local people
 leave fridges, cookers, sinks and     
 tumble dryers lying around in the     
 forest. They are starting to put up   
 fencing to keep the sheep out of      
 Cinderford but it is not doing any    
 good because the local council will   
 not put cattle grids across the roads </content>
