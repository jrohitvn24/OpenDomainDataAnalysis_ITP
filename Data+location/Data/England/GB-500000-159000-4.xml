		<content>  Crossroads Care Attendant scheme,    
 which began in Woking in January 1981,
 supports people who care for a        
 physically or mentally disabled person
 at home. It aims to relieve stress in 
 the family of the disabled person and 
 so avoid admission to hospital.       
  There are several Old People's Homes 
 in the area.Our School,Halstead, gives
 Harvest gifts to Arreton House, to    
 The Pines where we also sing carols at
 Christmas and to Beechcroft, a        
 hospital for the elderly.             
  The Westgate Centre, Chobham Road, is
 a Day Centre for the elderly and the  
 handicapped. We support the Multiple  
 Sclerosis Society which meets there   
 regularly and has an annual Garden    
 Party in our grounds each summer.     
  The Friends of the Elderly run an Old
 People's Home in Lavender Road and the
 Bernard Sunley Nursing Home,College Rd</content>
