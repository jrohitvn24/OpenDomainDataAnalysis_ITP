		<content>   The Borough has a population of     
 199,200 and is in between Birmingham  
 and Coventry. It covers 44,495 acres. 
 It is mainly residential but does have
 one large rural area in its boundries.
 The motto on its coat of arms is{Urbs 
{in Rure.}                             
   It is in the centre of a motorway   
 network and is very close to          
 Birmingham Airport and a main line    
 station. In 1970 it was chosen as a   
 site for the{National Exhibition      
{Centre.                               
   Most of the people who live in      
 Solihull own their own homes and 80%  
 of the working population are         
 proffessionals.                       
   To our surprise our survey showed   
 that most people were born in the     
 Birmingham area,but not surprisingly  
 are now better accomodated.
