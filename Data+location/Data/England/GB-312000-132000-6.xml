		<title>06THE BAKERY</title>
		<content> Mr Pullen is a master baker.          
                                       
 His Dad and Grandad were bakers before
 him.                                  
                                       
 When we went to the bakery we saw big 
 machines.  We saw the big bread oven. 
 We saw a man making sausage rolls.    
 There was a man making jam tarts.  The
 baking that Mr Pullen does is French  
 Sticks, and Wholemeal and Cottage     
 loaves, finger leaves, granary bread, 
 doughnuts, pasties, marshmallow ice   
 creams and cakes.                     
                                       
 When we went to the bakery we saw big 
 bags of flour.  One of the men put a  
 whole bag of flour into a big mixing  
 bowl.  There are lots and lots of bags
 of flour.  Mr Pullen gave us some     
 bread to eat.
