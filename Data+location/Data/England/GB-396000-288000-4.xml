		<content>  A small stream runs alongside        
 Broadwell Road, Oldbury, which is part
 of the River Tame. Starting at Rowley 
 Regis the river flows northwards to   
 eventually join the sea in the Humber 
 estuary. Before the Victorian age, the
 Tame was a good fishing river, but    
 waste dumped from factories polluted  
 it. Now in 1985 the Severn Trent Water
 Authority are cleaning up the river,  
 keeping a close watch on the amounts  
 and kinds of toxic waste dumped by    
 local factories. The Tame in Broadwell
 Road is, however, often yellow because
 it has iron in it from the Bromford   
 Iron Works. The ground still contains 
 the acid which was used 50 years ago  
 to pickle steel and this is still     
 slowly seeping into the river.
