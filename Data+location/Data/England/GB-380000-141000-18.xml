		<content> The congregation numbers about ten to 
 fifteen on average. There is no priest
 in charge so services are taken by the
 clergy of Minster Church in           
 Warminster. There are normally three  
 services a week. Last year there were 
 six weddings and four burials.        
                                       
 At Christmas time most of the village 
 attends a Carol Service followed by a 
 party at Forest House which was       
 formally the Vicarage.                
                                       
 There are no clubs or associations    
 connected with the Church at present  
 as there are with the Chapel.
