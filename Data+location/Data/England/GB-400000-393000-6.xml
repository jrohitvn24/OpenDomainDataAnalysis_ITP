		<content> At{break}crisps are sold and there are
 stalls and games in aid of{C.A.F.O.D. 
 or we go out and play games like{Rush.
 At{10.45am.}we start work again until 
{   12.15pm.}- lunchtime. After dinner 
 we have a long play out.              
 At{ 1.20pm.}we go back to work until  
    {3.20pm.}when we pack up, and if   
 there is any time we listen to a story
 (At the moment we are reading{....'The
{Year of the Worm'}by Ann Pilling)     
 At {3.30pm.}we put our chairs on our  
 tables and it is time to go home.     
   I walk home with three or four      
 friends, and when I get there{I feed  
{the cats,}get a cereal, watch Tv and  
 read a little. Often my friend Rachael
 rings up and asks me to come out. We  
 go to the{local park}and play on the {
{swings etc.}I go home to watch a      
 little Tv or read till my parents kiss
 me goodnight.         &lt;cont.from p5.) </content>
