		<content> This land consists of undulating      
 fertile clays and heavy loams split   
 into an average of 20 acre fields with
 hedges containing deciduous trees. The
 holdings are mostly mixed family run  
 farms. Corn grown is about 80% winter 
 wheat, 20% barley with some oil seed  
 rape and lupins. There are no dairy   
 cattle but beef and sheep are popular.
 Lambing is done under cover. Most     
 lambs go for meat. Horses for riding  
 are kept, the old working horses being
 replaced by tractors costing about    
 15000. All corn growing farms have a 
 combine harvester costing about       
 30000. Hay is made and carted using  
 mechanical handling equipment. Market 
 gardening is mostly winter greens,    
 spring and salad vegetables. The      
 orchards are apples and pears for     
 direct farm sales and retail, the main
 outlet being a supermarket chain.     </content>
