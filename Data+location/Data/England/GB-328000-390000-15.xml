		<content> On an estate near our school are two  
 stores.These are B&amp;Q,a "D.I.Y" store  
 and M.F.I.,a fruniture store.They are 
 about 4 miles from Birkenhead but are 
 close to Bidston Station and the M53  
 motorway.                             
 On Fri. June 28th. we went to find out
 why people want to shop there.We      
 decided that it would help the survey 
 if we interviewed the store managers. 
 Before the visit we divided into four 
 groups;two to interview the managers, 
 the others,the customers.We drew up a 
 list of suitable questions.           
       These are some of them.         
       _______________________
