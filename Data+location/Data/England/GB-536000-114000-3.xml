		<content> There was once a smugglers route from 
  Newhaven to Plumpton.There was once a
 cottage called Greencross. Once in    
 Plumpton,near the station,there was a 
 blacksmiths shop. Then it changed into
 a tuckshop.Since then the building has
 been made into a small hairdressers   
 shop. The station is very old and     
 opened in 1863.The people who looked  
 after the station had to walk to      
 Newhaven and back.The station is still
 open today but the gates are old and  
 rusty and are made of rotten wood.Not 
 many trains stop at Plumpton.They come
 from Brighton or Eastbourne and go to 
 London.Plumpton Place was once        
 surrounded by a moat but this was made
 into three lakes in the reign of King 
 Henry The Eigth.
