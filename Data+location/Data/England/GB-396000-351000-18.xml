		<content>   Cheddleton was linked with the      
 national railways until closed by Mr. 
 Beeching. The lines are still intact  
 and are used by the local railway     
 museum to exercise engines and        
 carriages they have renovated.        
   The canal was used extensively in   
 bringing coal to the paper            
 mills,collecting goods &amp; transporting 
 them to Ivy House, Hanley, another    
 paper mill. The canal fell into       
 disrepair when road transport was     
 found to be much cheaper and more     
 convenient. Around 1963 the canal was 
 cleared and repaired for recreational 
 purposes.                             
   Two bus companies serve the village-
 Berisfords and Proctors.Many residents
 run their own transport and commute to
 surrounding towns and Stoke-on-Trent. 
   The main road divides the village,  
 going south to Cellarhead.            </content>
