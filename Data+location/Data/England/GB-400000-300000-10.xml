		<title>10RUSHALL LOCAL HISTORY</title>
		<content> Rushall and Shelfield were recorded in
 the original Domesday Book; the former
 as a hide, six farms, two cottages and
 a mill, the latter as a hide of waste 
 land. In the sixteenth century there  
 was a road leading from Walsall to the
 Rushall mill. Rushall Hall was built  
 in the twelth century and was involved
 in the civil war. In 1776 the Turnpike
 Trust widened the road to Walsall so  
 traffic could pass through busy       
 Rushall. A canal was opened in 1840   
 and later extended to Birmingham. In  
 April 184 the South Staffs Railway    
 Company opened a line from Walsall to 
 Wichnor. Limepits, tanneries and coal 
 mining provided work for local people.
 Much of the area, including Shelfield,
 Goscote and Blakenhall was mainly     
 farmland and the twentieth century has
 seen the gradual encroachment of      
 housing and industry.                 </content>
