		<title>19Steam Rally,Near Pimperne.</title>
		<content>  For weeks each September the roads   
 round Pimperne are jammed by steam    
 rollers,steam engines, ancient farm   
 machinery, trailers and caravans.The  
 Stourpaine Bushes Great Working of    
 Steam is about to take place, an event
 very reminiscent of the old country   
 fair.Not only can one see farm        
 machinery powered by steam but country
 crafts,hurdle making,cheese and cider 
 making,wood and metal work,thatching. 
 The cacophony of sound of steam       
 organs,the rhythm of engines,the      
 magnificent sight of shire horses,    
 the a acrid smell of smoke and oil go 
 to make an unforgettable              
 experience.One is thrilled by the     
 explosion of sound from the           
 fairground,seduced by the insistent   
 calls of stall holders, intoxicated by
 the macabre anticipation of the ghost 
 train.A day to remember.              </content>
