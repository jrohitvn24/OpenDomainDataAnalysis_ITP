		<title>02High St.,Gt.Ayton + Area.</title>
		<content>  This is the lower part of the High   
 Street,away from the true central     
 business district of the village, so  
 there are more houses than shops,     
 though these latter include the       
 Riverside Wine Lodge (an off-licence),
 an estate agent that also acts for the
 Halifax Building Society, a bookshop, 
 a butcher, a cafe, a hairdresser, a   
 newsagent and a Do-It-Yourself wood   
 and materials shop. The street is     
 narrow and residents' parking of cars 
 causes traffic congestion. A          
 Congregational chapel has been        
 converted to residential use, but most
 houses are 18th. or 19th. century     
 brick with pantile or slate roofs,    
 built in terraces. The High Street    
 runs along the north side of the River
 Leven, to the south of which          
 'sheltered' accomodation is provided  
 for old people.                       </content>
