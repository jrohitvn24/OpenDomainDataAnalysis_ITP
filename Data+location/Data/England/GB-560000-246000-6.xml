		<title>06THE VILLAGE POST OFFICE</title>
		<content> The Post Office is in many ways       
 the centre of the village             
 community. .The people who own the    
 post office are new to the village    
 having only been there for 8 months   
 Their busiest day is Thursday.There   
 were 107 people in on Thursday.The    
 quietest day is Wednesday 45 people   
 came(because it is half day closing.) 
 The post office was built in 1880 so  
 it is 105 years old.It is also an off 
 licence and a general store so it is  
 quite busy.The post office is the only
 shop in Horseheath(for the elderly of 
 the village, with no cars, the        
 nearest shops mean a bus ride to      
 Haverhill or Cambridge) .They         
 open from 8.15a.m.until 6.0pm.Mon to  
 Sat(close 1.15pm Wed)Of the 28        
 households responding to a survey,19

  where,&amp; 5(all retired)at the P. O.   </content>
