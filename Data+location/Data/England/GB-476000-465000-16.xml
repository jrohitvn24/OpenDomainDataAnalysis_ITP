		<title>16ARABLE FARMING II.</title>
		<content>    This year our summer season began  
 late,and many of the crops are not as 
 far on as they have been in previous  
 years.This will make harvesting time  
 late and many farmers are hoping for  
 an improvement in the weather.A wet   
 Autumn could spoil a lot of the root  
 crops if they are still in the fields.
    Not all the farmers have their own 
 Combined Harvesters and Balers,and    
 hire machinery from local Agriculural 
 Suppliers in{MALTON,DRIFFIELD}or{YORK.
 Harvest-time is a very busy time and  
 some of the farmers work together to  
 get all their crops in before the bad 
 weather comes.                        
    The{AGRICULTURAL SHOWS}are popular 
 with all areas of the public as they  
 include many things,eg.Gymkhana,Pets, 
 and Flowers as well as all the trade  
 tents for the farmers.They provide an 
 enjoyable outing for all communities. </content>
