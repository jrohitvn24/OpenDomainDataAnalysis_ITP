		<title>01Introduction - Broxwood Area</title>

 This block of countryside is almost   
 wholly devoted to farming. It is      
 quiet, undulating and very pretty.    
 Main roads pass outside the area      
 except where the A4112 crosses its    
 south-east corner. Lower Broxwood is  
 the only assemblage of houses big     
 enough to be called a hamlet. The     
 nearest large village is Weobley just 
 south-east of the block, and the      
 nearest town is Kington, about 5 miles
 away to the north-west.
