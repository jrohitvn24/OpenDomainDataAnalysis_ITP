		<content> AT SARUM CENTRE THERE ARE 130 MENTALLY
 HANDICAPPED ADULTS BUT THEY DO NOT    
 LIVE THERE.  THEY HAVE NO RESIDENTIAL 
 ADULTS.  THE MENTALLY HANDICAPPED     
 PEOPLE WHO ATTEND SARUM CENTRE LIVE   
 ALL OVER THE SOUTH OF WILTSHIRE.  THEY
 GET THERE BY MINIBUSES AND CARS.  THEY
 GO FOR THE WHOLE DAY FROM 9 AM TO 4   
 PM.  THEY HAVE DINNER THERE.  THE MEN 
 AND WOMEN DO A LOT OF SORTING FOR     
 FIRMS IN SALISBURY.  THEY ALSO DO     
 IRONING AND GARDENING.  IN SALISBURY  
 THERE IS A HOSPITAL CALLED SALISBURY  
 GENERAL INFIRMARY.  THERE ARE NO      
 DOCTORS' SURGERIES WITHIN OUR BLOCK.  
 IF ANYBODY NEEDS A DOCTOR OR DENTIST  
 THEY HAVE TO GO INTO THE CITY.  THE   
 SCHOOL DOCTOR AND THE SCHOOL DENTIST  
 VISIT THE SCHOOL AT REGULAR INTERVALS 
 TO OVERSEE THE GENERAL HEALTH OF ALL  
 THE PUPILS IN THE SCHOOL.
