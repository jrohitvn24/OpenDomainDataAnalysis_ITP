		<title>09THE ABBEY GATEWAY</title>
		<content>  The most interesting building in     
 Kingswood is the Abbey Gatehouse which
 is part of the gateway to the old     
 Abbey. When the Abbey was built, it   
 took up a lot of space, but this was  
 before King Henry V111 knocked it down
 in 1640. All that was left was the    
 Gateway. Some of the old stones were  
 used to build the Upper School Room, a
 building at the top of the High       
 Street. The Gateway has houses joined 
 on to it now but it is still a tourist
 attraction. The key can be borrowed so
 people can unlock it and look around. 
 The Abbey Gatehouse is now used for   
 meetings of Kingswood Parish Council.
