		<content> From research carried out into the    
 activities offered at the leisure     
 centre, for 7-8 year age group and    
 10-11 year age group, there were      
 similarities. Swimming and physical   
 education were the most popoular,     
 perhaps because these are part of     
 their schooling. Children of the      
 younger age range normally only attend
 under parental supervision or with    
 friends, whereas later they attend    
 unaccompanied and so the number       
 increases.                            
{SWIMMING CLUB-}The club, held on      
 Mondays and Fridays, costs 30p per    
 night or Â£1.50 for the year. The club 
 swimming costume is black with a      
 yellow stripe down the side and a     
 matching hat.                         
{BALLET-}This class(six girls)is held  
 on a Saturday morning and costs 75p   
 for 45 mins. For this we wear a tutu. </content>
