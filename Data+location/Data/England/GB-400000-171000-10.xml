		<title>10    THE PARK - CALNE</title>
		<content> The park is a nice place to play but  
 some people cannot play there because 
 it is too far away.It has baby swings,
 very low swings  and it has very big  
 swings.It has a slide which you can   
 sometimes slide off the end.There is a
 climbing frame which some children use
 as a space ship becasue it has seats  
 in it.There is a roundabout which I   
 never go on because I saw a little    
 girl get trapped under it.There is a  
 see-saw which never goes unless       
 someone pushes it.There is a place    
 where some adults play bowls. In      
 the pavillion there is a bar and you  
 can play darts or snooker.Nearby there
 are two tennis courts with a hut where
 tennis players can have a drink or get
 changed.You have to pay ten pence for 
 the use of the court. There is a big  
 field to play on which is also used as
 a rugby pitch.                        </content>
