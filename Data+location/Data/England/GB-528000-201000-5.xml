		<content> The Hook was built by Benjamin Cherry 
 in 1859 incorporating material from   
 "Gobions" in Brookmans Park. From 1931
 to 1980 it was owned by The Greyhound 
 Racing Association who then sold it to
 The Oshwal Association of The U.K. the
 house at present is being modernised  
 and refurbished by the Architect John 
 F.Griffiths as a community centre for 
 the Jains,an Indian religious sect who
 came mainly from East Africa.It is    
 planned to organise the whole site    
 around the house to make it the       
 group's headquarters in Britain and   
 planning consent has been obtained for
 Assembly Halls and eventually a small 
 temple in the gardens.                
  Most of the meetings of the sect take
 place in July,August and September and
 marriages are performed during these  
 meetings.
