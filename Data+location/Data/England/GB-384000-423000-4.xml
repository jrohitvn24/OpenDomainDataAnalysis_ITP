		<title>04Bacup and its problems</title>
		<content> There is a good deal of vandalism in  
 our area. Certain parts of the main   
 town are almost derelict because so   
 many windows have been broken and the 
 buildings are in a bad state. We will 
 be glad when it is done up because it 
 has a bad reputation as the scruffiest
 place in Bacup.                       
 The back of the Leisure Hall has been 
 on fire. Some lads were seen playing  
 about with matches and set fire to it.
 The local council of Rossendale will  
 have to rebuild most of the roof.     
                                       
 There has been a fight between two    
 families. We are not allowed to name  
 the families so we will call them     
 family A and B. The fight first       
 started when one of family A stabbed  
 one of family B in the back at a local
 pub. There were running battles in the
 street.                               </content>
