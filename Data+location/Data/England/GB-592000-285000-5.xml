		<title>05Shopping, Bridgham</title>
		<content> Bridgham's last shop closed in l984;  
 therefore, the people of Bridgham have
 to travel to the surrounding towns and
 villages for their provisions.        
                                       
 Our survey of shopping trends showed  
 that Thetford (7 miles away and served
 by a Petch of Hopton coach on         
 Tuesdays) is the most important       
 centre, with East Harling (2 miles) a 
 close second.  Third in popularity is 
 Bury St. Edmunds (21 miles and served 
 by Petch's coaches on Wednesdays and  
 Saturdays).  Norwich, the county town,
 (25 miles) is fourth and Diss (14     
 miles) is fifth.  Our survey revealed 
 that people also visit places as far  
 away as Yarmouth, Cambridge and King's
 Lynn.  We are also served by mobile   
 shops; there are regular visits from  
 mobile baker, grocer, fishmongers and 
 the County Library.                   </content>
