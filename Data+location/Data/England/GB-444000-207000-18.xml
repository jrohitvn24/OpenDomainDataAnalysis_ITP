		<title>18Children in Wytham</title>
		<content> Nineteen children live in Wytham.They 
 form 14% of the total population,and  
 range from 6 months to 16 years of    
 age. Girls predominate in the older   
 age group, and boys in the younger. As
 there is no school in Wytham, a       
 Parents' Association was recently     
 formed to bring the children together 
 socially. Hallowe'en and Bonfire Night
 parties, Christmas concerts, Easter   
 cards, May celebrations, summer       
 picnics and walks are organised.      
 Sundays bring an opportunity for      
 singing, or playing a musical         
 instrument in the church choir or     
 attending Sunday School. Whether they 
 live in the Abbey, the lock, the farm 
 or one of the cottages, the children  
 enjoy the peaceful country life. A bus
 to school and having a small group of 
 friends are more than compensated     
 for by country pleasures.             </content>
