		<content>  { Central Avenue}is our main shopping
 centre in{West Bridgford.}There are   
 lots of different shops. They are     
 mainly food shops, but some sell toys,
 clothes, videos and furniture. There  
 are several shops joined together in a
 great long row.                       
   {Asda}is a very big shop where lots 
 of things are sold under one roof.    
 People walk round with shopping       
 trolleys and help themselves from the 
 shelves. Then they have to queue up at
 one of the check-outs to pay for their
 things. In the summer Asda has        
 gardening things near the entrance but
 in the winter they are replaced by    
 toys. There is a cafe inside Asda     
 where you can have a drink or some    
 food. Outside there is a petrol       
 station.                              
    There are several small shops      
 around West Bridgford too.            </content>
