   The most important activity in the  
 area is{walking}and East Hill Strips  
 is the most popular area offering fine
 views of the Otter Valley. There are  
 approximately 20miles of regularly    
 used{footpaths}in the block and       
 several publications advertise walks. 
                                       
   Local people make most use of the   
 area for recreation but a large car   
 park on East Hill encourages the      
 tourist to enjoy the area as well.    
 Footpaths are the only{managed        
 recreational facilities in the block. 
{Hunting}is an important pursuit for   
 many local people.                    </content>
