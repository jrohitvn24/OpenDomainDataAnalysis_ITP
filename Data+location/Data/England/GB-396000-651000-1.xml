		<content> Berwick is a small market town set    
 at the estuary of the R.Tweed.It is   
 approximately 60 miles from a major   
 city - Newcastle to the south and     
 Edinburgh to the north.The town is set
 in a rural area dominated by mixed    
 farming in the Merse of the Tweed.It  
 is the focus of much of the E.Borders.
 The population of the Town is about   
 12500 and has remained relatively     
 stable for many years.                
 There are many buildings of historical
 importance in the Town.The better     
 examples have been protected by being 
 declared as listed buildings.The Town 
 has a good name for preserving and    
 restoring old buildings including the 
 Barracks (museum for the King's Own   
 Scottish Borderers) and the Quay Walls
 (including the Customs House).        
 Being remote,Berwick has its own      
 culture,traditions and even dialect.  </content>
