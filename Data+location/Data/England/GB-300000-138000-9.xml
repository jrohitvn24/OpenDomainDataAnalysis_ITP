		<title>09       VILLAGE CRICKET</title>
		<content> In a game of cricket there are eleven 
 players on each side. Amateur games   
 have been played in villages for      
 a many years and each league has its  
 own particular rules as all matches   
 are played in the evenings or on one  
 day of the weekend.                   
 The players try to stick to the usual 
 rules of the game but there are always
 small changes made to keep the game   
 lively and interesting to everyone.   
 The village teams score points and    
 can make as many as 26 for each match.
 Sometimes the boundary is very close  
 and the batsmen find it easy to make a
 high score. At other times the sheep  
 or cattle have to be chased off the   
 field, even during a match.           
 At{Roadwater}they have to be careful  
 that the ball is not lost in the river
 or the trees, and that any cars are   
 parked well away from the pitch.      </content>
