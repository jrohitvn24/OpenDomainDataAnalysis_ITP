		<title>06LIVING IN GROBY.</title>
		<content>    Groby is a pleasant place to live  
 in,with plenty of friendly people     
 surrounding you.When I first came to  
 Groby I was very nervous but everybody
 made me very welcome.I gradually made 
 friends with helpful people showing me
 round the village.You can always find 
 something to do in Groby,for instance 
 a walk in Martinshaw Wood that we are 
 now fighting to keep,I don't think    
 Groby would be the same without it.   
 You don't have to walk far to the     
 shops and those in the centre of the  
 village include a newsagent,jeweller, 
 greengrocers,chemist,bank,small       
 supermarket,bank,building society and 
 post office.                          
    People come from miles around to   
 visit Groby Pool and Bradgate Park    
 both well known beauty spots.There is 
 also a Pick-Your-Own farm where you   
 can get fresh fruit and vegetables.   </content>
