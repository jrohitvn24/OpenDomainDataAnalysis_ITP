		<title>16Commercial Activity</title>
		<content> There is very little commerce in      
 Shorwell apart from a general store   
 which also serves as the post office. 
 There is one public house, "The       
 Crown", which has recently been       
 rebuilt and modernised but in a way   
 which fits in with surrounding        
 cottages. Bar meals are served there  
 as well as drinks. There is also a    
 builder's yard which has a good stock 
 of building materials. Farming        
 dominates the landscape and is by far 
 the major activity. In Shorwell, based
 around Northcourt manor, there is a   
 market garden which is particularly   
 busy in summer selling "self pick"    
 fresh fruit and vegetables,           
 especially raspberries and            
 strawberries. At Yafford the mill,    
 zoo, museum and adventure playground  
 make up a considerable and profitable 
 tourist attraction.                   </content>
