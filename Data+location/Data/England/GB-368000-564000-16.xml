		<title>16Haltwhistle Library</title>
		<content>   The Library is on the main street   
 and is open for part of each day      
 except Wednesday and Sunday.  When the
 librarian has her summer holiday it is
 closed for two weeks but we are       
 allowed to take double the normal     
 number of books out.  On a wet day it 
 is a warm, comfortable place to be.   
 There are armchairs to sit on and     
 games such as chess and dominoes to   
 play.  We can read the magazines and  
 books that we are not allowed to take 
 away.  There is a BBC computer.  The  
 librarian likes us to be there so long
 as we behave ourselves.               
   For very young children there are   
 some tiny chairs and a low unit for   
 books.  Sometimes they get excited and
 shout out loud.                       
   If you enjoy listening to music you 
 can borrow records.  Local groups take
 turns to put up displays.             </content>
