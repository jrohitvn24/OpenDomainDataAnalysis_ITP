		<title>18Pets in Walmer</title>
		<content> Most people in Walmer have pets. The  
 most common pet is a dog. The         
 pensioners do not have pets mainly    
 because they can not get out to buy   
 the food. The{pet food shop}is liked  
 by many people but it is not used a   
 great deal. Most people think they    
 should sell pets as nearly everyone in
 Walmer likes pets.                    
                                       
 Deal has two{pet shops}in the High    
 Street. I asked the owners lots of    
 questions about the shop, the animals 
 and how they got their jobs. The      
 owners told me that they liked their  
 jobs because they love animals. The   
 most popular pets are{rabbits}in      
 summer and{hamsters}in winter.        
                                       
 A survey of the school showed that{75%
 of the school have pets. The most     
 popular animals are{cats and dogs.    </content>
