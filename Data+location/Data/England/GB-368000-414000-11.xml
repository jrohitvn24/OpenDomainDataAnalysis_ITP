		<title>11TRADE AND SHOPPING, EGERTON</title>
		<content>     The village has few shops, and    
 these tend to cater for daily         
 requirements such as groceries,       
 newspapers, tobacco, confectionary,   
 green groceries and drinks.           
     Whilst 45% regularly, and 55%     
 occasionally use the local shops,94%  
 buy the bulk of their requirements at 
 supermarkets or major stores in       
 Bolton.                               
     The post office is regularly used 
 by 70% of the population, and there   
 are two mail collections daily.The    
 sole telephone box is not used often, 
 as 93% of houses have a private       
 telephone.                            
     The majority of residents,79%,    
 consider the local shopping facilities
 to be adequate.                       
     There are no banks or financial   
 institutions in the village.
