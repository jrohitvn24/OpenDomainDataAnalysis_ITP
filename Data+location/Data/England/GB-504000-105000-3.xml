 Mindless idiots  have been blamed for 
 a crash on the A27 at Poling which    
 fatally injured a horse and wrote off 
 a car. Vandals broke down a fence     
 letting three horses escape and stray 
 onto the dual carriageway.            
   The car driver escaped unhurt. The  
 two loose horses ran back to their    
 stable unharmed.                      
   It was not the first time the       
 fence had been torn down and the      
 horses let free. A couple of years ago
 exactly the samething happened.       
   Vandalism is a feature of the 1980's
 even in this rural area.              
   Pets have been killed,school windows
 smashed and a pond which children had 
 built was destroyed.                  
   Nobody seems to know the solution to
 this problem.
