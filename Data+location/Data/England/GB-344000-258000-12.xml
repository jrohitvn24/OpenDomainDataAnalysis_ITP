		<title>12LOCAL HISTORY W. LEOMINSTER</title>
		<content>   Barons' Cross, the main residential 
 part of West Leominster, derives its  
 name from the Marcher Lords in King   
 John's reign.  The Marcher Lords met  
 there to discuss plans which resulted 
 in the signing of the Magna Carta.    
   Nearby is Cursneh Hill, an ancient  
 fortified earthwork.  During the Wars 
 of the Roses the Yorkists were        
 entrenched on Cursneh Hill and were   
 driven off by mixed forces of Welsh   
 and Irish troops.                     
   During the Wars of the Roses many   
 troops came through this area, as the 
 Battle of Mortimer's Cross was only   
 about half a mile outside the area.
