		<title>12TAKING THE DRIVING TEST</title>
		<content> If you want to drive a car, you have  
 to pass a test to show that you are   
 safe on the road. This is what it felt
 like.                                 
 September 5th, the big day. I hope I  
 pass -I couldn't stand the jokes at   
 school.The instructor arrives and     
 says,"I know you're good enough to    
 pass, but anything can go wrong on the
 day." Reluctantly I drive into the    
 test centre; when I see the others    
 waiting I know my feelings are not    
 unique. Off we go -take the third     
 turning on the right, please- missed  
 it! Oh well,the test only cost me     
 twenty pounds. Turn the car           
 here,please -I reckon you could turn a
 bus here. Hill start, reversing into a
 side road, Highway code- the test     
 passes in a frenzied whirl. A voice   
 says, "Well,Miss Heyes, I'm pleased to
 say you passed!" What a relief!       </content>
