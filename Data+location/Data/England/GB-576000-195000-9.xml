		<title>09MEADOWCROFT NURSERIES</title>
		<content>  The Meadowcroft Nurseries occupy a   
 site on the Old Woodham Road.  The    
 nursery has been trading for twenty-  
 five years and is now run by two      
 brothers.  The overall area of the    
 nursery is 2.8 hectares, 1 hectare    
 being under glass or plastic tunnels. 
 There is a large farm shop in which is
 sold a large variety of garden        
 sundries, tools and ornaments.  Due to
 the poor soil on the site, all topsoil
 has to be brought in and after        
 sterilisation it is mixed with peat   
 and various fertilizers to make the   
 compost.                              
 The nursery specialises in a large    
 range of conifers and also fancy      
 heathers of many colours and types.   
 It employs five people full-time and  
 up to twenty part-time workers.
