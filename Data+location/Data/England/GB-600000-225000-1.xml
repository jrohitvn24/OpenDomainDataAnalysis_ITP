		<content> Cowdray and St Andrews Avenues were   
 Colchesters' by-pass.They take less   
 traffic since the A12 now by-passes   
 Colchester.In Colchester there are    
 lots of cream and maroon buses.The    
 farthest they go North is Mile End,   
 East is Wivenhoe,South is Blackheath. 
 Through Colchester flows the river    
 Colne.It is the lowest bridging point 
 before it becomes tidal.One industrial
 area in our part of Colchester is near
 East Gates,another is beside Cowdray  
 Avenue.The Siege House,dating back to 
 before 1648,has little discs on       
 its walls which mark 15th century     
 bullet holes.There is one very large  
 secondary school in our area.There is 
 still a large amount of farmland to   
 the north and east but large areas are
 being developed for housing at        
 Longridge Park and High Woods.
