		<content> About 90 pupils aged 5-11 years attend
 the Church of England Primary School. 
 At 9.15am they arrive on bicycle or   
 foot or by car. They begin their day  
 with a spirited talk and a song with  
 meaningful purpose. Each week the     
 Rector takes assembly  and teachers   
 and children accompany the singing    
 with guitars, recorders and           
 percussion. The three lady teachers   
 and the headmaster teach English,     
 reading, writing and mathematics.     
 All the children study the Natural and
 Scientific world they live in and     
 express this in Art, Craft and Music. 
 After their lunch break the children  
 sometimes learn to swim in their own  
 pool and play organised games until   
 home time. The school is lucky to have
 extensive grounds.
