   This area is mainly  council houses.
 Types  of homes are flats, maisonettes
 and  terraced &amp; semi detatched houses.
  {Many people  have moved out of their
{houses  because  they  are  now  being
{demolished. When they build new houses
{they move back to the area.           
{ }There are quite a few building sites
 and  some  houses  near us which  have
 recently been built. The people prefer
 houses to high rise flats because they
 can have a garden  and they don't have
 stairs to climb  if lifts  break down.
  {There is a home for  old people  and
{it is called Thomas  Winder  Court. If
{old  people  are in  trouble an  alarm
{sounds and a red light flashes  'HELP'
{ }People  mostly cook on gas,  because
 it's cheaper than electricity and heat
 their  homes  with  gas too.  Some use
 electricity  and only a few use  coal.</content>
