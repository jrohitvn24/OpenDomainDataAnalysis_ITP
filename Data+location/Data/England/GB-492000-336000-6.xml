		<content> Londonthorpe is a small settlement on 
 the edge of the Lincolnshire Limestone
 Hills, NE of Grantham. An ancient     
 village mentioned in the Domesday Book
 in 1086 as Lunduntrop. It has a Danish
 origin, a hilltop encampment for Norse
 settlers overlooking the wooded Witham
 Valley. Today it has 30 houses &amp; a pop
 of 100. St Johns church dates from    
 1100 AD and is Saxon in style as far  
 as the tower portion which remains can
 tell us. It was rebuilt and extended  
 at later times especially in 1879 when
 the bulk of the present building was  
 made. The west wall still has a Norman
 window and on the south side is a     
 stone crusader. Earlier this century  
 there was a village school, now a     
 bungalow.Newgate Lane used to have a  
 stone wash house belonging to 4 of the
 dwellings, now a reading room for     
 children. Now a dormitory settlement. </content>
