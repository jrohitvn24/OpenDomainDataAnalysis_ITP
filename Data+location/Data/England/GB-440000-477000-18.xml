		<content>    In such a scattered area           
 communications are not easy, and      
 almost every home has a telephone as a
 link with the outside world. Ordering 
 for animal feeds, grain and other     
 necessities can be done easily by     
 telephone, as well as calling the     
 Doctor, Vet, emergency services or    
 just a social call. The car is also an
 essential method of communication and 
 every home has one.                   
    The postman calls once a day, in   
 the morning and will take any letters 
 for posting, as well as delivering the
 daily post and possibly the newspaper.
 No newsagent would consider delivering
 to such outlying homes.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
