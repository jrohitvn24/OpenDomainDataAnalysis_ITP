		<title>18A HISTORY OF BISPHAM</title>
		<content> Since 1418, Bispham has been an       
 ill-defined area lying within         
 Blackpool. Before the Romans arrived  
 it was an area of impassable bogs. In 
 the Domesday Book, the ancient parish 
 of Bispham is recorded as Biscopham.  
 The parish prospered and grew, though 
 it was nearly wiped out by the Black  
 Death in 1349. The first amusement    
 centre to be built in Bispham was     
 Uncle Tom's Cabin, mentioned on       
 another page.                         
 Bispham has now grown into a thriving 
 community, with its own community     
 centre,where all kinds of people and  
 groups meet. The bogs and barren land 
 have been replaced by modern houses   
 and amenities; nowadays, although it  
 is still a part of Blackpool, it is   
 often called Bispham Village.
