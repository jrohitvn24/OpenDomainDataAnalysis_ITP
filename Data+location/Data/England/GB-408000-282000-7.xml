		<content>The largest factory in our area is     
Lucas, it is situated in Formans Road  
and employs 1000 people. It is the     
transport division for the Lucas Group 
and both heavy goods vehicles and vans 
are based there. The factory produces  
components for the home market and     
export. It manufactures batteries, die 
castings, which requires a foundry, and
plastic mouldings which are the light  
and indicator covers.                  
      The factory has its own canteen  
facilities but it shares its recreation
facilities with the whole Lucas Group. 
In recent years there have been        
suggestions that the Lucas factory     
poses serious health hazards during the
manufacture of batteries from the lead 
pollution in the air.
