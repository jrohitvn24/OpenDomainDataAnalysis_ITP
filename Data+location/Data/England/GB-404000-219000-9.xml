		<title>09HAMPEN,THE HAMLET</title>
		<content> Hampen,in the parish of Shipton       
 Oliffe,is a hamlet a mile west of     
 Salperton.It consists of three groups 
 of dwellings,Hampen Manor with its    
 farm buildings and 3 cottages,Hampen  
 House with outbuildings and 3         
 cottages,2 of which have been sold to 
 private owners,and Hampen Fam,near the
 A436 Andoversford-Bourton road which  
 is now a private house with no land   
 attached.                             
 Hampen Manor,built of Cotswold stone  
 and about 500 years old,is in a valley
 and surrounded by trees.It has an air 
 of solid practicality,while Hampen    
 House,just above it,is an imposing    
 residence with a Georgian frontage.It 
 is no longer a farm and its 11        
 hectares are used as pasture for      
 horses.
