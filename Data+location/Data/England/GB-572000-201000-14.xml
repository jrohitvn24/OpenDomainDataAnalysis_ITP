		<title>14THE MUSHROOM FARM GRT.BADDOW</title>
		<content>                                       
 During the last war the army was      
 billetted in Baddow Park House. The   
 family who bought the house and land  
 decided to go into the mushroom       
 business, as mushrooms then were a    
 luxury item.                          
   The mushrooms are grown on horse    
 manure which mostly comes from the    
 stables at Newmarket-about 60 tons a  
 week. The manure is put into piles and
 sprayed with water. It is turned three
 times a week. Then it is sterilised   
 and put into crates with the mushroom 
 spawn. The spawn is grown on          
 sterilised wheat. The wheat grain has 
 to be sterilised so that the wheat    
 will not grow.This is then mixed with 
 the compost and when the spawn has    
 grown through,a mixture of peat and   
 chalk is put on top.
