		<content>8.00 I woke up and went to the bathroom
and had a wash. I cleaned my teeth and 
went back to my bedroom. I got dressed 
and went downstairs for breakfast. I   
left home at 8.40. I walked to school. 
It took me 5 minutes. The school bell  
rang at 8.55. I go into school, hang my
coat up and go to the classroom. In    
class we are registered. At 9.05 we go 
into the hall for assembly, which ended
at 9.40. We returned to the classroom  
and got changed for P.E. After P.E. we 
did S.R.A. until morning break at      
10.40. We had play in the playground   
until 10.55. We then had Maths Sets    
until 12.00 when it was time for lunch.
I had my lunch in the dining room and  
then played football in the playground 
until 13.00. After registration we went
to our English Sets until 14.15. we had
play until 14.30. In class we drew     
pictures until end of school at 15.30. </content>
