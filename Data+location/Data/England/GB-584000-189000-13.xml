		<content> There used to be lots of nurseries in 
 Hawkwell like Potash, Rawal-Pindi and 
 Spencers. Now there are only two,     
 Potash and Rawal-Pindi.Rawal-Pindi is 
 open all week.It sells, shrubs,       
 trelis, bedding plants and wood.      
 Rawal-Pindi is run by the family      
 who live in a house nearby.They sell  
 tomato plants. In one of the          
 greenhouses they have 30 big tomato   
 plants.When the tomato plants are     
 fully grown they can not lift         
 them.They can get 5-8lbs of tomatos   
 off the plants.The plants are put on  
 benches with holes in, which lets the 
 air come through. They take the       
 flowers off their Geraniums to make   
 them grow better.They don't get many  
 people in the winter because they     
 don't have many plants. They have an  
 old sheep. Rawal-Pindi has been there 
 since the first world war.            </content>
