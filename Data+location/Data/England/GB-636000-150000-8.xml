		<title>08Computer Games</title>
		<content> My hobby is playing computer games. My
 favourite kinds of games are humorous,
 cartoonistic games, but I like almost 
 any type. My family obtained our      
 computer on Christmas Day as a gift to
 my Mum. But I got an{interface}and my 
 Dad got a{joystick.}Most of my games  
 are bought but some are copied. There 
 are new peripherals being produced all
 the time like{ROM cartridges}and      
{speech synthesizers.}The computer     
 companies are Sinclair, Commodore,    
 Dragon, Oric, Apple &amp; Acorn. My       
 favourite game at the moment is{Daley 
{Thompson's Decathlon.}It comes in two 
 parts and part one does not load. Part
 wo consists of the 110 metres hurdles,
 pole vault, javelin, discus, and the  
 1500 metres run. To play, you have to 
 get as many points as possible and    
 qualify on each event. I like computer
 games a lot.                          </content>
