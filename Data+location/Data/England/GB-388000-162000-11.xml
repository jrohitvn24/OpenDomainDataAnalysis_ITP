		<title>11MY NAN IN MELKSHAM</title>
		<content>   My nan is an old aged pensioner and 
 a widow.  She lives in a council      
 bugalow opposite Lowbourne Junior     
 School, which is my school.  My nan's 
 bungalow was built on the old canal in
 1981.  The foudations are beginning to
 move and my nan's bungalow is rising. 
 West Wiltshire County Council are     
 coming once a week to measure how much
 it moves in a month.  They have not   
 said what they will do when they know 
 how much it has moved.  There are 6   
 rooms in the bungalow: a lounge,      
 kitchen, bathroom, 2 bedrooms and a   
 spare room.  My nan lives in sheltered
 accommodation.  She can pull a cord in
 any room if she is in trouble and     
 someone will come round immediately.  
 She gets a widow's State Pension of   
 Â£37.74 a week and her rent is Â£32.72 a
 fortnight.                            
                                       </content>
