		<title>12ST.PETER'S CHURCH</title>
		<content>                                       
On Tuesday 2nd July 1985 we visited    
Church Hanborough with Mrs Jones. At   
the church we met Miss Gibson who lives
at 'Mylors' behind the pub, and who    
keeps the church keys. Above the door  
is a Norman carving of St.Peter. On    
one of the pillars inside the church   
are some pieces of glass to measure the
structural faults. The hassocks on the 
floor were all hand-made, and in the   
church there is a small kitchen. There 
is an old clock which hasn't got a     
face. We sat in the seat where the     
churchwarden sits, opposite the organ. 
                                       
Outside in the graveyard are graves of 
the Wastie family which is a very old  
family in this area. There are two boys
called Wastie at our school and their  
dad owns the garage on the A40.
