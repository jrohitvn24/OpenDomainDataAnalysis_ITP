		<title>10Living in Bearwood (7)</title>
		<content>  We asked people in Bearwood some     
 questions as to{why they chose to live
 here.                                 
  About{80%}of the families had lived  
 here for over{10}years. Many had two  
 or even three generations living close
 by.                                   
  People liked this area for several   
 reasons. The most common was that     
 Bearwood has a nice{friendly community
 where it was easy to make new friends.
 Other reasons were the wide variety of
{shops and the two nice parks.         
  Most people didn't like the{noisy and
{dangerous traffic}nor the{dirty       
{pavements.                            
  Many said they would not move even if
 they were able to. The favourite area 
 to move to was Worcestershire.
