{ }Flockton school, a 5-10 First       
 school, is dated 1696, but it is known
 that one existed earlier in the       
 village. Written records go back to   
 1864 in the present school, and during
 1984-85 improvements costing some     
 Â£120,000 have been made to the school 
 to give the children more modern      
 facilities.                           
   The majority of children in the     
 remaining villages attend schools not 
 in this block as Netherton and        
 Middlestown Junior and Infant schools 
 are just out of this area, and the    
 older children attend Horbury         
 Comprehensive.
