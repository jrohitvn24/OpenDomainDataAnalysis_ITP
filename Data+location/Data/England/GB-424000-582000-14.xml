		<title>14The Caravan Site</title>
		<content>      There have been caravans on the  
 site for  3O years.  There are 4O in  
 the winter and 2O in the summer.  All 
 are occupied by show people.  Lorries 
 pull the caravans.  The show people   
 travel around the North of England and
 some to Scotland.  The furthest they  
 go in England is to Leeds and         
 Stokesley, and in Scotland to Glasgow.
  All the people are related to each   
 other.                                
      The settled people, who live on  
 the site all year, have central       
 heating run on solid fuel.  They have 
 a water supply plumbed in.  All the   
 caravans have electricity with        
 ordinary meters and most have flush   
 toilets.  The land at Choppington     
 belongs to the Showmans Guild.  A     
 Caretaker collects the rent.
