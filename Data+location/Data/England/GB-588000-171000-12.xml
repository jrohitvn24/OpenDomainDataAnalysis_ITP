		<title>12QUEENBOROUGH BOAT SURVEY</title>
		<content>    On July 3rd we went and looked at  
 the boats moored at{Queenborough Hard.
 We estimated that there were about 27 
 yachts, 52 motor boats, 2 catamarans  
 and 7 fishing boats.                  
    There is one small slipway which   
 reaches down to the water even at the 
 lowest tide. As it is only about 3m   
 wide, cars are not allowed on the     
 slipway. Lots of people have a hard   
 job pulling their boats up.           
    There are few rings to tie the boat
 to once it is in the water. It costs  
 Â£120 to moor your boat there for eight
 months.                               
    There are lots of buoys attached to
 chains anchored to the bottom. It is  
 very sheltered at{Queenborough}though 
 the tides are strong. We thought there
 should be more safety facilities.
