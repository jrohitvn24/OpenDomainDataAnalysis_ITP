		<title>14A Day in the Life of Joanne</title>
		<content> At 8.45 a.m. I set off for School     
 which starts at 9.15.  The bell goes  
 and we walk into class.  Mr. Hughes   
 marks the register and tells us that  
 Mrs. Keeling is coming in the         
 afternoon to show us some of her      
 animals.  Tina and I take the dinner  
 book to each class so that Mrs.       
 Wright, our cook, weill know how many 
 are staying for dinner.  Tina and I   
 give out the hymn books at Assembly,  
 and then we have English and Maths    
 until dinner time.  After dinner-play 
 it is quiet time and I read my book   
 called "Gemma Alone".  Then Mrs.      
 Keeling talks about the owl,          
 salamander, rat and snake she has     
 brought.  I like the owl best.  During
 the last lesson the boys play cricket 
 and the girls play rounders.  We all  
 go home at 3.45.
