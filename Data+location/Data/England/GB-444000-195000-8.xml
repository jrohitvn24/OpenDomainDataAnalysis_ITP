   During the year we have made a lot  
of visits to Manor Farm. This belongs  
to Mr Cumber who has a son at the      
school.                                
   The farm has about 1,000 acres with 
21 fields. This is divided into about  
300 acres for wheat, 180 acres for     
maize,190 acres for grass and 330 acres
for barley.                            
   He has 160 Friesian cows. These give
milk and the young bulls are sold as   
beef. He has a big cubicle house which 
takes 80 cows at a time for milking. We
let the calves suck our fingers.       
   Each cow gives on average 6,000     
litres each year. He gets 14p for each 
litre.
