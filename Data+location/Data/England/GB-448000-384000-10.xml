		<title>10Recreation -Todwick.</title>
		<content> In  Todwick there are two{playing     
{fields,}called the 'rec and the park. 
 The grounds can be used by adults for 
 football and cricket and for children 
 there are  swings, a slide, a         
 roundabout, and a B.M.X track for     
 bicycle riding. People go to clubs    
 like Teenyboppers, which is for       
 younger children, and for teenagers   
 there is the{Youth Club.}Gardening, or
 tending an allotment, is mostly for   
 older people who enjoy it because it  
 relaxes them. Taking a dog for a walk 
 in a field or somewhere like that is  
 relaxing. Children might go cycling on
 the B.M.X course and adults might ride
 cycles for sport. We also have        
 horseriding stables. Adults might go  
 to a pub or restaurant for a meal or  
 drink. There are cinemas,theatres and 
 sports facilities in nearby towns.
