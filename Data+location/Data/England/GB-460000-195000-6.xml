  At Brownies we play lots of games. In
winter we play "Murder in the Dark".   
  Our leader, (we call her Brown Owl), 
tells one of us to play the murderer,  
but we are not to tell anyone else. She
then turns the light out; the murderer 
pretends to kill someone, who screams  
and lies down dead. Then the light is  
put on. Then a detective has to        
question everybody. Only the murderer  
is allowed to tell fibs. The detective 
must guess the murderer but is only    
allowed three guesses.                 
 On Remembrance Sunday we march to the 
War Memorial and join in a Service with
scouts, cubs, brass band and British   
Legion.
