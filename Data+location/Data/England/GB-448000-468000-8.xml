 The biggest single employer of people 
 in the area is farming.Even           
 when people have taken other jobs they
 often do so reluctantly and because   
 they have been unable to raise the    
 capital for their own land.The idea of
 dividing up large farms into smaller  
 units rented out by the council, as   
 happened at Manor Farm just after     
 World War I, seems very popular, but  
 there are not enough of these to go   
 round.Often families take a plot of 2 
 or 3 acres to work on part time and   
 take another full time job.Some of    
 them have been farm workers but as    
 rents,rates and wages have risen, they
 have been increasingly replaced by    
 machines.At busy times farmers make up
 their work force with their           
 parents,grandparents,cousins and      
 friends.                              </content>
