		<content>    The River Severn flows through the 
 area from north to south in a curve   
 that takes it past the villages of    
 Jackfield and Coalport,which are rich 
 in the relics of the clay industries  
 of the 19th.Century.The Coalport China
 Works and the Craven Dunhill Tile     
 Works are open to the public and form 
 part of the Ironbridge Gorge Museum . 
    The banks of the river are heavily 
 wooded while away from the river the  
 land is mainly arable and mixed       
 farming.                              
    At the western edge of the area are
 the outskirts of the town of Broseley 
 where new housing estates have been   
 and are being built over land         
 previously  used for the old tile     
 works and clay industries.A primary   
 school built in 1976 serves these     
 areas.                                
                                       </content>
