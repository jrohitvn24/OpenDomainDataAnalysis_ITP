		<content> Riding Mill village is near to the    
 River Tyne in a valley.Nearly every   
 way you look you see trees,hills and  
 fields. Many of the houses are quite  
 old. One of the oldest buildings is   
 the Mill.Next to the Mill is The      
 Wellington Public House which used to 
 be the house of the Mill owner.Next to
 the youth centre there is a building  
 which used to be the old school.There 
 is a church next to the old school and
 new school which is in use now.The    
 church is about 100 years old which   
 is not very old compared to Bywell    
 church.Which was built in the Norman  
 times.The Village Hall is probably the
 most used place in the Village.It is  
 used for gym, badminton and the Drama 
 Club plays.The Youth Centre is used   
 for Play school,Cubs and Brownies.    
 Riding Mill is a good place to play.
