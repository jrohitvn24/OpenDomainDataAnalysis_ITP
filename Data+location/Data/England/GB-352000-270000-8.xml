		<content>  The area around Ashford is mainly    
 countryside.The nearest town is three 
 miles away,Ludlow.There is a bus      
 service to Ludlow on a Monday,        
 Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. We    
 conducted a survey to find out how    
 many people owned their own           
 transport.This is what we learned from
 our survey:We found out that only two 
 houses in our survey area had not got 
 a car. It is essential that you have a
 car if you live in Ashford because    
 there is a very limited bus           
 service and you would be unable to    
 get about , to do shopping or         
 follow leisure activities or go to    
 work.There is a train line that       
 runs through Ashford but no           
 station.If there was a station it     
 would provide access to Hereford      
 and Shrewsbury.
