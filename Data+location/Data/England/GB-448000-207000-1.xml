interesting aspects for the Domesday   
project,for one thing it is one of the 
few cities with its own radio          
station.Oxford is most famous for its  
colleges;the oldest colleges date from 
the 12th Century.Oxford also holds the 
head quarters of Oxfam the world       
famous famine relief centre.Oxford is  
also famous for its traditions:it still
has a sheriff and a mayor.             
  One of the oldest things in Oxford is
probably Port Meadow.It was mentioned  
in the original Domesday book and was  
an Iron age burial ground.The sheriff  
of Oxford still has horse races on the 
meadow once a year.                    
  Our twelve squares consist of common 
land,(Port Meadow),farmland,and        
residential.
