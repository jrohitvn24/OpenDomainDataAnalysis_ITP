		<content>          *** THE GREAT OAK ***        
  {The Great Oak} is the oldest tree in
Weedon and grows in Croft Way.It is 400
years old.In the time of the {Black    
Death} our oak was only a baby.The     
children who managed to escape from the
city came to dance around the oak.The  
oak today is old and knobbly but people
still respect it.Even though it is very
old it has no ivy growing on it.       
         *** ST. WERBURGH ***          
  In the seventh century {Werburgh}    
supervised the nunnery at Weedon.It is 
said there was a shortage of corn      
because geese were eating it.Werburgh  
summoned the geese and instructed them 
never to return.To this day "no wild   
geese ever settle in Weedon field".
