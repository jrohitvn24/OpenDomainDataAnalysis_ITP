		<title>08LAINDON COMMUNITY HALL BURNS</title>
		<content> One of the most unfortunate events in 
 Laindon this year has been the burning
 of the{Community Centre in Aston Road 
 on 14th February 1985. The fire was   
 discovered at 3 a.m. by a police      
 patrol. Firemen had to come from      
 Basildon, Billericay and Corringham.  
 It took them over an hour to bring the
 blaze under control. The firemen's job
 was made more difficult by the cold   
 weather. Hoses were frozen to the     
 ground and the water turned to        
 icicles.                              
 Between sixty to seventy local        
 community groups used the centre.     
 Basildon Council have tried to get    
 them temporary accommodation.         
 No one knows the real cause of the    
 fire.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
