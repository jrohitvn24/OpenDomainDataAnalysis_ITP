		<title>10FARMING IN THE WEDMORE AREA</title>
		<content>   In the area many houses bear farm   
 titles but they are no longer working 
 farms. Of the 17 major farms remaining
 most have between 50 and 200 acres    
 with a few around 300 acres. The      
 holdings consist of a large part of   
 the land around the house and some    
 (often rented) on the flat moorland.  
   The farms are mainly dairy of       
 predominately Freisian herds with a   
 ratio of one acre per head of cattle. 
 Most farms rear a small percentage of 
 beef cattle (Herefords) and some also 
 have a few sheep. The cattle are fed  
 in the winter on silage, hay and      
 concentrates and on grass from April  
 until October.1/3 of the farmers use  
 Artificial Insemination for their cows
 while 2/3 use A.I. in conjunction with
 a bull (usually a Hereford).          
   There are a number of small holdings
 one of which has 17 goats.            </content>
