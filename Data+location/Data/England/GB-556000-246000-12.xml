		<title>12LOCAL HISTORY OF LINTON</title>
		<content>   The earliest settlement of Linton   
 dates from the Iron age.Various bone  
 implements were discovered at the     
 site.There is also evidence for Roman 
 and Saxon settlements.Skeletons and   
 artefacts from both periods have been 
 found. The word Linton means          
 "flax-town"in Anglo-Saxon.            
   The earliest written record of      
 Linton dates from the Domesday        
 book of 1086,but we can see many      
 buildings and sites that give us      
 clues to Linton's age. The church     
 (St.Mary the virgin) dates from the   
 early 12th century.Near to the church 
 we can see evidence of a ford.        
   Along the High Street,which follows 
 an ancient routeway,there are many    
 timber framed buildings.Chandler's,one
 of the oldest,dates from the 13th     
 century.The Guildhall,dating from the 
 16th century is another fine example. </content>
