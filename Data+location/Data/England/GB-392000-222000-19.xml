		<title>19REGENT ARCADE, CHELTENHAM</title>
		<content>  Built on the site of The Plough, an  
 old Coaching Inn, the Regent{Arcade  }
 was opened in the Spring of 1985 by   
 HRH The{Princess Anne,}only daughter  
 of Queen Elizabeth 11.                
  CHILD'S VIEW. "It looks very big from
 the entrance but it is not really that
 big inside. My dad is an{architect,}he
 has been working on the plan for eight
 years. It took three years to build.  
  There are lots of clothes and card   
 shops. There is a very shiny, slippery
 marble floor. There are mirrors       
 everywhere, even on the umbrella like 
 tops over the seats. There is a glass 
 lift which gives a good view of the   
 Arcade. There is a multi-storey car   
 park with six or seven levels. You are
 dizzy by the time you get to the level
 you want. A sign near the entrance    
 shows where the first jet plane was   
 built forty years ago".               </content>
