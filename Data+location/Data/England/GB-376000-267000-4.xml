		<content>    One futher part of Astley, also not
 in the block, deserves mention. Almost
 1km due South of the church lies      
{GLASSHAMPTON MONASTERY,}which now     
 belongs to the{Society of St. Francis,
 an Anglican order. It has been a      
 religious house since{1920}and was    
 established in its present form in    
{1947.}The stables and gardens are all 
 that remain of a large mansion, burnt 
 down in 1810, built on an ancient site
 mentioned in the Domesday Book.       
                                       
   The Brothers are familiar figures in
 the area, and help to take services at
 the local churches. Their Christmas   
 Eve Midnight Communion is attended by 
 neighbouring villagers.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
