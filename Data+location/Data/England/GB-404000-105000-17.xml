		<title>17Monmouth's Ash</title>
		<content>     The Duke of Monmouth was Charles  
 the 2nds eldest illigitimate son.     
     Monmouth himself was in exile     
 in Holland when the crown was taken by
 his catholic uncle James 2nd.         
     The Duke, a protestant set sail   
 from Holland in 1685 and landed with  
 Dutch mercenaries at Lyme Regis,where 
 he recruited further local militia to 
 fight the king and gain the crown.    
     The two sides met near Bridgewater
 at a place called Sedgemoor.          
     A supposed surprise attack ended  
 in disaster, the Duke and his army    
 were put to flight. On July 8th he was
 captured close to a hollow ash tree   
 between Horton and Verwood.Monmouth   
 was found crouching in a ditch.       
     Although the ash has long since   
 died,saplings have grown from the bowl
 &amp; the spot has ever since been refered
 to as Monmouth's Ash.                 </content>
