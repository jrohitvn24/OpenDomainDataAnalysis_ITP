		<content> In Borehamwood there are various      
 churches of differing denominations.  
 These include Church of England, Roman
 Catholic, Congregational and          
 Presbyterian, Baptist and Evangelical.
 There are more{Church of England      
 places of worship than for any other  
 denomination.                         
   In addition there are some Jewish   
 believers and a{Synagogue}has been    
 established for this community.       
   More people in Borehamwood go to    
{Free Churches}than any other kind of  
 church. However not many people attend
 church in this town. In fact, one     
 particular C of E church has only one 
 service each Sunday instead of two.   
 They also have some financial problems
 since the church costs Â£1,500 per week
 to run. The new church roof cost      
 Â£19,000. Vandals are also a problem.  
 They break the stained glass windows. </content>
