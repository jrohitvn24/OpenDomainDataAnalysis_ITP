		<content>  The church has always been important 
 to village life. The three parishes of
 Belchamp St.Paul, Ovington and Tilbury
 Juxta-Clare are combined with one     
 Vicar who lives in the new Vicarage in
 Belchamp St.Paul. The builings are    
 historical monuments and are lovingly 
 maintained. Â£36,000 was recently      
 raised to repair St.Andrew's B.St.Paul
  A Church of England family communion 
 service is held on Sundays at 10.00 am
 and there are extra services at Easter
 Harvest and Christmas. Christenings,  
 weddings and funerals also take place 
 as necessary. Many people visit the   
 churches at Harvest Festival time when
 they are beautifully decorated.       
  It costs over Â£2000 to run a church  
 so money is raised by collections, a  
 grant from the Parish Council and     
 functions such as a Fete in the summer
 and a Social Afternoon at Christmas.  </content>
