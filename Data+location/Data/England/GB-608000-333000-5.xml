		<title>05FARMING IN EDGEFIELD &amp; AREA</title>
		<content> Agriculture is the prime concern of   
 the area. The main crops are cereals, 
 root crops including potatoes and     
 sugar beet, and grassland for grazing 
 of both cattle and sheep.One farm     
 concentrates on chickens and another  
 on pigs. Edgefield Hall has a trout   
 farm. Most of the farms are owner-    
 occupied, but some belong to the Stody
 estates. (Stody is about 2 miles west 
 of our area.)                         
 There is also managed woodland: some  
 of the plantations are of conifers    
 with an edging of deciduous trees, so 
 that visually they appear in the      
 landscape as an older style of        
 planting. There is still a Little Wood
 &amp; once there was Great Wood which     
 belonged to Binham Priory. The felling
 of Great Wood during the Napoleonic   
 wars affected the population of       
 Edgefield as it provided employment.  </content>
