		<title>07The day of a farmer's boy 4</title>
		<content> Usually a job like this may carry on  
 tight the way through the rest of the 
 evening. Sometimes the engine in the  
 Fiat tractors don not stop working    
 until 10.00 pm. In the case of last   
 Thursday it was just after ten o clock
 before we reached the farmhouse for   
 supper.Supper is made by my Mum who   
 starts to boil the kettle as soon as  
 she spots the tractor entering the    
 gate in the huge yard. I had a cup of 
 coffee and some chocolate biscuits.   
 After a quick look at the television  
 it's up to bed for a good night's     
 sleep. Until the alarm wakes me the   
 following day.
