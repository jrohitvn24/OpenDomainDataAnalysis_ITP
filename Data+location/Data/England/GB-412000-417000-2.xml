		<title>02HUDDERSFIELD OPEN MARKKET</title>
		<content> Our block has many different types of 
 shops. Out of town shoping streets,two
 large Hypermarkets,and several large  
 D.I.Y. stores, but we thought the most
 interesting was the Open Market.      
 Tuesday and Saturday are second-hand  
 markets with clothes, materials,      
 shoes, jewellery and many other       
 intersting things. People come because
 it is close to where they live and    
 they can get bargains.                
 The Monday and Thursday Market is much
 busier with about 18O stalls selling  
 mostly clothes, materials and         
 vegetables.                           
 The market is in the old wholesale    
 vegetable market built in 1888 and    
 renovated in 1980.  It is a large     
 Victorian, iron and glass building,   
 painted in maroon, yellow and gold.   
 It is a very popular and busy market.
