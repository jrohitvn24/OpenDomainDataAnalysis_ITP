		<title>18LINDLEY CLOCK TOWER</title>
		<content>  The clock tower in Lidget Street,    
 Lindley was built in 1902. It was     
 built by a man named James Nields     
 Sykes who lived at Fieldhead, Lindley.
 He owned a large factory there and his
 workers were always late for work.    
 Their excuse always was that they had 
 not got a watch,therefore he built the
 clock tower so they knew the time.    
  Above the door of the clock tower is 
 a small foundation stone which says{  
{"For the purpose of his village"}as   
 well as who it was built by. On the   
 walls there are four statues, two of  
 farmers sowing and harvesting and two 
 angels praying. At each corner of the 
 green roof there are dragon heads.    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
