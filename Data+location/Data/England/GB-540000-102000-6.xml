		<content>  Piddinghoe is a small semi-rural     
village between Newhaven and Lewes. It 
is largely a dormitory today with most 
travelling outside the village to work.
  It has very few amenities a pub, a   
public  green (known as the Hoe), on   
the river are a few private moorings   
and a pond for wind-surfing and        
sailing.                               
  There is no library in the Village   
but the rural service visits the       
village approximately every three      
weeks.                                 
  Piddinghoe is an ideal place from    
which to view the annual Lewes to      
Newhaven Raft Race.                    
  Piddinghoe is full of narrow streets,
which the local buses sometimes have   
great difficulty in getting along.     
  The main Lewes Newhaven road bypasses
the village keeping most traffic out of
Piddinghoe.                            </content>
