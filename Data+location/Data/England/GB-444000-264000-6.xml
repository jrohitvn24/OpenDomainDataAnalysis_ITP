		<content>  Broadwell has just one main street   
with the houses built along both sides 
of it.The houses are roughly split     
between ones built in the 1800's and   
those built since the 1960's.          
  Traditionly Broadwell was a farming  
village but few of the inhabitants work
on the land now,most people work in the
neighbouring towns.                    
  The 3 largest houses in the village  
are still farms with "Broadwell House  
Farm" being the largest.               
  There do not appear to be street     
names but the houses themselves usually
have names.                            
  Evidence of Broadwell's past can be  
found in the rows of terraced cottages,
which were originally built for the    
farm labourers to live in.
