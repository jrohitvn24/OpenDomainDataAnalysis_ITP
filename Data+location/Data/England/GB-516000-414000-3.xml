		<content> There are two taxi ranks in Immingham;
 the Civic Centre and the County Hotel.
 During the day, the Civic Centre is   
 the busiest but the County Hotel is   
 the busiest at night.                 
 Many of the taxi drivers in Immingham 
 are part-timers and they may have     
 another job as well.                  
 One of the most annoying incidents    
 when driving a taxi is the time when  
 the fare you go to pick up has already
 taken another taxi or has simply      
 disappeared when you arrive.          
 There are many amusing things which   
 can happen especially when people have
 had too much to drink.Many taxi       
 drivers are regularly called out in   
 the middle of the night but it is all 
 part of the job.

 and John Mummery.)
