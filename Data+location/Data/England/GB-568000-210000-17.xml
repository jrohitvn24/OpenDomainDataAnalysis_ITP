{Long Huzz}is a ball game. Anyone can  
 play the game but that is if you are  
 over 4 years. You can play on the     
 netball court. What you do is throw   
 the tennis ball and if it hits the    
 fence at the other end the person who 
 threw it gets a point. If you throw   
 the tennis ball and it hits the fence 
 and then  the other people catch it,  
 it does not count as a catch.So the   
 person who threw it gets another      
 point.If you throw the tennis ball and
 the people at the other end catch it  
 they would score a point. You can have
 as many people playing as you want. If
 the little ones play it they just     
 throw it and don't  have scores.      
   The only problem with this game is, 
 it hits teachers' cars.
