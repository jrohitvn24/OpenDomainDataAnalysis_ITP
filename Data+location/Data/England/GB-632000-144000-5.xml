		<title>05MARTIN MILL VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Martin Mill owes its existence to the 
 railway station. It grew up after 1881
 whereas the parent village of Martin  
 is at least 1000 years older. The     
 station now provides a good service   
 along the London to Sandwich line. At 
 peak times the trains call there every
 30 minutes. There are 57 houses in the
 village more than half_post war. There
 is a public house;"The Ugly Duckling",
 and a farm shop which is part of the  
 Hawthorn Caravan and Camping site.    
 Once a farm,it's 25 acres to the      
 south of the village have been laid   
 out to cater for 153 static homes many
 occupied by retired people in the     
 summer. This contrasts with rest of   
 the village where only 14% are retired
 folk. The station has made the village
 a dormitory but 2 out of 3 people use 
 cars to get to work,school and        
 shops,chiefly in Dover.               </content>
