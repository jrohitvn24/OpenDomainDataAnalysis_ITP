		<title>20The School Fete</title>
		<content> One day I like most after Christmas   
 and my birthday is the day we have our
 school fete which is usually held in  
 July.It really is a smashing day.Every
 body is rushing around getting the    
 things ready for putting in the       
 competitions of which there are many  
 such as cakes,bread,eggs,flowers ,and 
 vegetables.We also enter a drawing    
 competition from each of our classes. 
 I am hoping the sun soon starts       
 shining so it will help my plants and 
 seeds to grow.Then I can have a stall 
 of my own on the day.Mum has said she 
 will make me some small jars of home  
 made jam to put on my stall.We all    
 have a lovely time going around all   
 the other stalls and shows.At the end 
 we are all very tired.
