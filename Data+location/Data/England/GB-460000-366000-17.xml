{Sherwood Forest.}He also robbed the   
 rich and gave to the poor,he roamed   
 the trees till he got to{Nottingham}  
 and crept sneakily into{Nottingham    
{Castle}and then he robbed.Sometimes he
 ambushed stage coaches like highwaymen
 do.Robin Hood is believed to steal but
 when you think about it we must       
 remember that he gave it to the poor. 
 He was believed to get married in{    
{Blidworth Church}not{Edwinstowe Church
 and the most common weapon he used    
 was the{bow and arrow}he would have   
 killed the{Deer}and eaten all he      
 killed.Yes,Robin Hood did come to     
 Edwinstowe.He did have{Merry Men}like{
{Friar Tuck,Little John and Will       
{Scarlet.}No-one knows he existed      
 really"                               </content>
