		<title>10Interview with a resident.</title>
		<content> Mr. Frank Howell has lived in Moreton 
 Morrell since 1950. He was formerly   
 Vice-Principal of the College of      
 Agriculture, but has now retired.     
 The children asked him about houses   
 built in the last 35 years. They are:-
 3 council houses at the top of Duffus 
 Hill, the houses in Fuller Place,     
 8 houses on the southern side of Brook
 Lane, Nicholaston' Brook Lane, 48     
 council houses in Oak Tree Close,     
 4 houses for workers on the College's 
 Estate.                               
 Bearing in mind the huge developements
 in Wellesbourne the village has       
 changed very little. It has responded 
 minimally to the desire of those      
 wishing to live away from towns.      
 Because of the lack of facilities the 
 County Council, prompted by a strong  
 Parish Council, has not been keen to  
 see any large scale development.      </content>
