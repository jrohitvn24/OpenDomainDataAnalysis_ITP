		<title>01BROADWELL: GAZETEER</title>
		<content>  In this rural area of the North      
 Cotswolds, land falls from 190m-110m  
 above sea level. The River Evenlode   
 flows S.E. to the Thames following the
 valley which also provides the route  
 for the London-Hereford railway. Most 
 of the land is used for mixed farming.
 The villages of Broadwell &amp; Oddington 
 have houses for about 250 families.   
 Both villages have parish churches.   
 Broadwell, listed in the 1086 Domesday
 Book, has a village school. People    
 create their own recreational         
 activities. Family cars are necessary 
 transport. There are few bus services.
 Many tourists visit this scenic area  
 as customers of the Pottery, the      
 Alpine Nursery, to order a hand-      
 crafted chair or to visit the ancient 
 church of St.Nicholas at Oddington.
