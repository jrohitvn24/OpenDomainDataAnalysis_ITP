		<title>10Buses Vital to Emborough</title>
		<content> Being in an agricultural area, the    
 people of Emborough live mainly on    
 farms and therefore often have their  
 own transport.  This is necessary as  
 the only bus service detours the      
 village. However a walk of a few      
 minutes brings would be travellers    
 within range of the route.  The       
 service is an hourly one between Wells
 and Bath.  Having no local shops      
 within walking distance can be        
 awkward, especially for old people and
 mothers with young children if they   
 are without the use of a car.  The    
 buses theefore are a vital link and   
 despite the relatively low number of  
 people using them,  they must be      
 maintained. People living on the outer
 edges of our square, however, have    
 access to shops at Chewton Mendip and 
 Chilcompton.                          
                                       </content>
