{ }Typical of the larger houses in the 
 area is The Old Rectory at Whiston.   
 The house stands near Whiston Parish  
 Church and was built by the Earl of   
 Effingham for his son in 1840.He was  
 the Rector of Whiston and his former  
 Rectory was overcrowded owing to the  
 fact that he had thirteen children.   
 On the ground floor there are eight   
 rooms and eight rooms on the second   
 floor. In the attic you find the rooms
 where the servants used to sleep.In   
 the cellars where slaughtered beasts  
 were hung on a series of hooks,blood  
 would drain through a series of       
 channels cut in the floor.A secret    
 passage that led to the local woods   
 has been bricked up. The house set in 
 extensive and beautiful grounds is a  
 home and a base for Rotherham         
 Saddlery,selling equestrian equipment.</content>
