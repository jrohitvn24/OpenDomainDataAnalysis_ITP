  {Cinderella Farm,}plant their crops  
 between winter and May. The crops they
 grow are{strawberries and raspberries 
 which when ripe, they pay people to   
 pick, so that they can sell them to   
 markets. They also make some of them  
 into raspberry or strawberry jam for  
 people who come to their little shop  
 and buy them. Sometimes they sell     
 strawberries in punnets so people can 
 take them home and eat them for tea.  
                                       
   Their land covers nine acres. The   
 crops start to fruit between May and  
 August when they are ready to pick. A 
 long time ago{Cinderella Farm}didn't  
 grow crops, instead they kept animals 
 such as sheep, cows, chickens and pigs
 and when they were old they used to   
 kill them and sell their meat for     
 money.                                </content>
