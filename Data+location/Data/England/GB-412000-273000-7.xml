		<title>07THE VICARAGE</title>
		<content> The vicarage is a very interesting    
 building.It is about 145 years old.The
 present vicar is the Reverend Degg and
 he has lived here for about 7 years.  
 The vicarage now has ten rooms but    
 centuries ago there were many more    
 rooms.Only two people live in the     
 vicarage now plus a very big dog.     
   Outside, the old coach house and    
 stables have been changed.Extensions  
 to the vicarage have been made and    
 windows have been altered.            
   The vicarage is not next to the     
 church because the people who built it
 did not own the land next to the      
 church,so it is a short walk away.    
    In October 1985 the Rev.Degg will  
 be having a very important visitor to 
 the vicarage,the Bishop of Birmingham.
