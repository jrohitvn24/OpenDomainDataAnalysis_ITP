		<content>Although Tean does have a small Co-op  
Supermarket, two butchers shops, a     
general grocers,a bakers, two          
newsagents,a D.I.Y. shop and a post    
office, most people travel to Cheadle  
or Stoke for their shopping needs.     
Cheadle was especially popular for food
buying. Tean shops were generally used 
by elderly people or those without     
their own transport.                   
The biggest complaint about shopping   
was the lack of specialised shops such 
as a Chemists, although there is a     
dispensary in the Surgery in Old Road.
