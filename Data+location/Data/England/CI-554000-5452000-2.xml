		<title>02SUNKEN FOREST - ST OUEN</title>
		<content> Between the Watersplash Night club and
 the Milano Bars there is a peat area  
 which was once a forest. The forest   
 grew after the last glacial period    
 finished some 10000 years ago.  It    
 flourished until well into Neolithic  
 times when it was eventually buried   
 beneath blown sand.                   
                                       
 The sea level rose to its present     
 level about 2,000 years B.C.and since 
 then the sea has eroded the peat      
 areas. In the future these may be     
 eroded away from the beach but the    
 forest will still exist in the area   
 because it extends under the sand     
 dunes. In the peat we have found      
 worked flint and Neolithic pottery    
 which shows that the area was         
 inhabited all that time ago.
