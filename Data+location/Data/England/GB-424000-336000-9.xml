		<content> Cottage Farm, Osliston, consists of 54
 acres of grassland.  It has been in   
 our family since the late 1800's.  At 
 present I, Anne, and Eric Parkinson,  
 son Andrew (14) and daughter Rachel   
 (11) live here.  My Grandfather,      
 William Sessions, came here as a      
 tenant farmer, then bought it later   
 on.  My father, George Sessions,      
 youngest son of eleven children was   
 born here in 1902, and attended Long  
 Lane School and Church.  30 members of
 the Sessions family have attended Long
 Lane School between 1888 and 1985.    
 During my father's life_time it was a 
 mixed farm.  He died here in 1974,    
 whereupon we took over.  We modernised
 the buildings and put up a cubicle    
 shed, making it an intensive dairy    
 unit, although milk is not as         
 profitable since the introduction of  
 quotas in 1984.                       </content>
