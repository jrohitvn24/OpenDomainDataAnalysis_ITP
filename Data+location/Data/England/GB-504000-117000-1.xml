		<title>01PULBOROUGH, WEST SUSSEX.</title>
		<content> Pulborough could be described either  
 as a large village or a small town. It
 is situated on a low sandstone        
 escarpment, overlooking the extensive 
 flood plain of the River Arun, in the 
 Weald. The site has always been one of
 importance, being at the crossroads   
 of the main London to Chichester (A29)
 route and the Shoreham to Midhurst    
 (A283) road. There is a railway       
 station affording easy access to      
 London and Portsmouth. Commercial     
 river traffic ceased earlier this     
 century, the tidal waters of the Arun 
 now being used for leisure craft and  
 fishing. Just south of the village is 
 the confluence of the Western Rother  
 with the Arun, and it is the former   
 that supplies the village with water. 
 Focal points are the 13th.century     
 church, village hall and recreation   
 ground.                               </content>
