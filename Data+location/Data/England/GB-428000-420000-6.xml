		<title>06SILCOATES SUMMER SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Every year there is a summer          
 school at Silcoates School for        
 children aged nine to thirteen. There 
 are 12 activities like archery, art,  
 badminton, canoeing, computering,     
 cricket, golf, rugby, squash,         
 swimming, table tennis and tennis. If 
 you want to do canoeing you have to be
 able to swim at least 50 metres. You  
 can swim in the afternoons and do     
 canoeing in the mornings. The course  
 costs Â£42.50 and includes lunch every 
 day. Each day is split into four      
 sessions: 9.30_10.30, 10.45_11.45,    
 1.00_2.00, 2.15_3.15. Boys and girls  
 may choose 4 activities, one for each 
 session or 3 activities, spending two 
 sessions on one activity. I am hoping 
 to take part in canoeing, archery, art
 and swimming. I am looking forward to 
 it very much.
