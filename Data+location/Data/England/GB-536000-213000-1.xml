{Ware}is a small town with a rapidly   
 expanding population.Situated in the  
 Lea Valley,twenty one miles north of  
 London and three miles from the shire 
 town of Hertford its growth can be

 its original buildings dating back    
 hundreds of years and the town was    
 declared an outstanding conservation  
 area by the  Historic Buildings       
 Council in 1973.
