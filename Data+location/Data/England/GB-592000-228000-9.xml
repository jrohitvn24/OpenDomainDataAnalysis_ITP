		<title>09FORDHAM FETE</title>
		<content> On Saturday the 8th of June the       
 Fordham fete was held.The procession  
 was shorter than usual and was led by 
 the bagpipes, followed by people in   
 fancy dress.I  do not like the sound  
 of the bagpipes so I did not enjoy the
 procession.When I got into the field  
 it looked very colourful.The first    
 thing that caught my eye was the crane
 because it was so big and brightly    
 coloured.Having a ride on this crane  
 was the first thing I did.Then I      
 walked round the stalls and played the
 nail game which was very easy to play.
 After this I looked at the other      
 stalls, the tombola, the coconut      
 shy,bowling for the pig,ice cream van 
 and lots more.The stall which made the
 most money was the raffle,  it raised 
 Â£170.You could also watch eggs        
 hatching out in an incubator.The  most
 exciting thing was the crane ride.    </content>
