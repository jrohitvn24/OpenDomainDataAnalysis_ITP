		<content>  Before 1820 most of the land was     
owned by the Marquess of Anglesey and  
there were no houses except one called 
Lamb Lodge, with a few surrounding     
thatched cottages which owners of      
various pieces of land lived in. Some  
of these cottages remain.              
  About 6 months after a mine at       
Chasewater called "The Marquess" was   
opened, in 1849, the manager of the pit
asked for some cottages to be built and
these were the beginning of Chasetown .
As Chasetown became more of a coal     
producing area many more miners'       
terraces were built.                   
  Chasetown continued to grow around   
the mining industry and about 1950 the 
Oakdene Council estate was built. This 
lead to more private estates being     
built with the majority of houses being
semi-detached and very few detached.   
All developement has been low-rise.    </content>
