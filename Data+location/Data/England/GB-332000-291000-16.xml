		<title>16RECREATION - Lydham/More</title>
		<content> Part of Shropshire Hills Area of Out- 
 standing Natural Beauty,{walking, pony
{riding, botanising, bird watching}are 
 popular with tourists and residents,  
 also{paddling and bathing}in West Onny
 river. Cars drive along our quiet     
 roads, and tourists picnic on verges  
 or drive into fields. Heavy through   
 traffic uses the main A488 and A489 to
 Mid-Wales and Welsh Coast.{Camps}for  
 Scouts, Guides and Pony Clubs are     
 allowed by some landowners; Ramblers' 
 Association and Naturalists' Trusts   
 arrange{guided walks.}Fossils abound  
 in the Pentamerus beds of Silurian    
{Rocks}from which are built many homes 
 and farm buildings. Collecting fossils
 is easy - samples can be picked up in 
 fields, gardens and several small dis-
 used quarries.{Tourism}is attracted by
 outdoor{recreation}and we enjoy       
 gardening}as a useful pastime.        </content>
