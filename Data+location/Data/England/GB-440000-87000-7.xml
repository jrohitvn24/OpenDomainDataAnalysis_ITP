		<content>    The{milking parlour}is 7 years     
 old.12 cows come in at a time.        
    The Guernseys come in first. They  
 feed on concentrates in troughs. The  
 person doing the milking stands in the
 middle and puts the machines on the   
 cows. Sometimes they kick.It takes    
 just over{2 hours}to milk{100 cows.  }
 Your hands and feet get very cold in  
 winter. It takes 2-3 minutes to milk  
 each cow.                             
    The first milking is at 6 o'clock  
 and the second at 4 o'clock in the    
 afternoon.                            
    The milk is kept cool at 40        
 degrees.The{tanker}comes every day and
 the milk is piped into it.            
    The milk is tested for bacteria and
 antibiotics. There has to be some     
 bacteria in the milk for cheese       
 making.
