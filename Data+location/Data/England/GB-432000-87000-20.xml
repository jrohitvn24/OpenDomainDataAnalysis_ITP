{Conservation Work at Totland          
{Recreation Ground.                    
 On the 17th April we began our work at
 Totland Recreation Ground. We met the 
 third year and two classes went on the
 yellow bus.We arrived and Mr Collis   
 showed us our bit of hedge to         
 clear.Some of it was taller than us   
 and very thick.We had a pair of large 
 secateurs with long handles.It was    
 very hot and we needed some           
 refreshment after walking home.We also
 saw a donkey that we called Fury after
 one on a TV programme                 
                                       
{ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS }The work on this    
 project was undertaken by pupils aged 
 5-9 of Yarmouth Primary School.Edited 
 by Headteacher Mrs S Sharp.Work on    
 Freshwater was submitted by pupils of 
 West Wight Middle School.             </content>
