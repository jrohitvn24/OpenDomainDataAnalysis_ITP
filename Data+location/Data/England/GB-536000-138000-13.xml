		<content> There has been an increase in the     
 overall number of employees during the
 last year against the national        
 trend,although an individual          
 industrial company has made cuts to   
 its work force. At the present time   
 there is a total of 800 registered    
 unemployed in East Grinstead. Of the  
 workforce 80% work full time, with    
 another 1,300 people being employed on
 a temporary basis mainly in the       
 building and construction industries. 
 The average annual holiday is 4 weeks.
 The businesses who replied have very  
 few employees who are Trade Union     
 members.The very infrequent strikes   
 were usually shorter than three weeks 
 and involved problems arising from    
 pay, working conditions and new       
 technology.
