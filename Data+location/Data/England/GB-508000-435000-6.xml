		<title>06Wawne, village housing.</title>
		<content> Long established village families live
 in the older houses, farm workers     
 cottages, the lodge to Windham        
 Manor, old farm-house lying within the
 village or the council owned estate,  
 (built in the 50's).                  
                                       
 The newer privately-owned housing     
 estate is inhabited by 'newcomers',   
 many with young families. These       
 people work in Hull or Beverely and   
 work in, mainly, either professional  
 or business capacities. The newer     
 houses are semi-detached chalet       
 bungalows or houses, with a few larger
 detached ones here and there. Many    
 were built on old church land or the  
 site of Windham Manor (demolished in  
 the 50's) and the new roads of Glebe  
 Road, Church Rd and Windham Cresent   
 reflect their origin in their names.
