 On the 1st of June Byley church held a
 Rose Fete at Byley C.P. School to     
 raise some money for the church funds.
  There was a procession to the school 
 field where there were games like     
 dares and rolling marbles through a   
 hole in the bottom of a plant pot with
 a spoon.  There were games of bowls   
 and a few stalls.  There were handmade
 toys and sweets.  There was a raffle  
 at 6.00 PM after which the field was  
 closed.  The church raised Â£600.
