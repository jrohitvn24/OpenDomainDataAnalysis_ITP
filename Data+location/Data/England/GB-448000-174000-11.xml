		<title>11Roads &amp; effects:World's End</title>
		<content> The World's End area was originally a 
 fairly peaceful little rural area, but
 now it has changed:due to the M4 and  
 the A34.                              
    The M4 has changed the area into   
 what is known as rurban (partly rural,
 partly urban). It is slowly turning   
 into a dormitory town for those       
 commuters who wish to use the M4 and  
 the A34.                              
    To some people these roads have    
 given great benefits and to others,   
 great disadvantages. Pub owners, for  
 instance, have either gained customers
 who stop to drink, or lose customers  
 if their road is used less (Don's Cafe
 is an example). Noise and pollution   
 affect most people although there is  
 not much pollution. The roads have    
 also brought new industries to the    
 area (the M4 is known as{silicon      
{valley})                              </content>
