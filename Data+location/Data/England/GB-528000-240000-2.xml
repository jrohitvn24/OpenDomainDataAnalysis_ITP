		<content>  Steeple Morden is perfect for country
 walks and trails.There are many       
 bridle-ways where anyone can take     
 their pony or dog.At the bottom of my 
 garden their is a small stream,and the
 dogs love to go for a run down        
 there.As long as I keep to the        
 edge of the fields the farmer         
 doesn't mind a bit.                   
  At the bottom of Bogs Gap Lane is a  
 bridle-way leading to Abington        
 Piggots,half way down the bridle-way  
 is a small patch of roughage which is 
 now a conservation area.Young trees   
 have been planted to take place of the
 old ones that have been cut down.All  
 sorts of wildlife is in that area,and 
 I think it is a very good idea to     
 conserve it.
