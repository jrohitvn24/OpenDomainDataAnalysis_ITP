 Most children live at least half a    
 mile from school and have transport to
 and from school. This is usually      
 parents'cars or a bike.               
 The traffic one the minor roads in our
 area is usually quite light, 7 were   
 counted in one 10 minute period. In   
 contrast the A1 is much busier with   
 337 in one 10 minute period.          
 On the country roads you have to slow 
 down because of all the bends, people,
 rabbits , pheasants and partridge. On 
 the A1 traffic travels much faster    
 because it is a dual carriageway with 
 two lanes of traffic in each          
 direction. You would have to slow down
 though when a slow lorry is being     
 overtaken by another lorry.
