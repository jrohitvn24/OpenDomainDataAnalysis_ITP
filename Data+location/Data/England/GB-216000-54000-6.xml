		<content> There is always a day-long educational
 outing in the summer,near the end of  
 the summer term.The children also     
 each invite an elderly person to tea  
 in school.The school organises a {    
{Village Concert.}The children take    
 part as well as other local people.We 
 swim each week all through the        
 year.The school owns a B.B.C.computer.
 School clubs are Recorder,Computer,   
 Maths and Games.We have an end-of-year
 service in church,when parents,       
 Governors and children all take part. 
 During the summer term 5 or 6 children
 make an exchange with children from a 
 school outside the county.The children
 are "matched" and stay with their     
 "friend" and go to school for the week
 with him or her. Special activities   
 are arranged in each school when the  
 children make their visits.
