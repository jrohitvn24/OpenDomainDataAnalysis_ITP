		<content> Of the seven lodges and farms shown in
 the block only three are still        
 occupied. Leigh Lodge Farm (829040) is
 occupied by a tenant farmer. It is    
 subject to a Restrictive Preservation 
 Order and therefore can't be allowed  
 to fall down should it become         
 vacant. This farm is one of the most  
 accessible by road which accounts for 
 it's continued habitation. In winter  
 the area is exposed due to lack of    
 hedgerows and is susceptible to       
 drifting snow. The road to the farm is
 metalled and straight and joins a     
 public road 2 Km away.                
 The other lodges owe their demise to  
 their inaccessibility, especially in  
 winter. Swintley Lodge (825045) was   
 occupied until 15 years ago. It had   
 access only by bridlepath.            
 Those employed on the land tend to    
 live outside the area.                </content>
