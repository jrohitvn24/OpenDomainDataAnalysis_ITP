		<title>12SPOONER ROW STATION</title>
		<content> A group of us visited the station and 
 saw lots of interesting things. While 
 we were there the shift changed. Three
 people work in the signal box, one    
 lady and two men, who take it in turns
 to be on duty. The lady has worked for
 British Rail for one year and one of  
 the men has worked for 35 years for   
 BR. Each shift lasts for 9 hours 45   
 mins. During the day 39 trains go     
 through each weekday, with fewer      
 trains at weekends. They go to        
 Cambridge,  Peterborough, Norwich,    
 London, Ely and Birmingham. Only 12 of
 these trains stop at Spooner Row      
 station each day, as only a few people
 get on and off there. The signal box  
 is made of wood with a brick base and 
 is about 90 years old. Inside there   
 are two telephones and a fire         
 extinguisher. There are 15 levers     
 (only 7 work) and two gate locks.     </content>
