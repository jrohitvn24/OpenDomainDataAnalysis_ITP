		<content>      As a selected settlement under   
 the Humberside County Council's       
 Structure Plan, Bempton is expanding. 
 Housing needs are at present being met
 by the operations of two building     
 sites. One of the sites  is comprised 
 of 2 and 3 bedroomed bungalows; these 
 are aimed at the first time buyer and 
 the retired. The second of the sites  
 is for 3, 4 and five bedroomed family 
 houses. As a non selected settlement, 
 Buckton experiences very little       
 development.                          
      The population of the area at the
 last census was 760 but this figure   
 must have increased since then by     
 something in the region of 50 more    
 residents.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
