		<content> My school has two playgrounds, 7      
 classes, a playing field, a sandpit   
 and a swimming pool. We are losing two
 teachers this year and are employing  
 one teacher so next term we will have 
 6 classes instead of 7.The school     
 doesn't have a hall but we rent the   
 village hall across the road. We hold 
 events in the hall connected with the 
 school, like discos and exhibitions of
 childrens work. Every morning we have 
 an assembly in the hall. The juniors  
 have their lunch hour at 12.10, most  
 of us stay for sandwiches.We come to  
 school 5 days a week for 6 hours and  
 15 minutes a day including 1 hour 20  
 minutes playtime. There are           
 approximately 190 children in the     
 school. We are very lucky to have 3   
 classroom assistants who help out in  
 the classrooms. We have 2 other dinner
 helpers, 2 cooks and 4 cleaners.      </content>
