		<content> The vegetation is mostly purple moor  
 grass and mat grass.  Where it is     
 drier heather flourishes and in a few 
 places one occasionally finds         
 bilberries.  Lower down on the        
 improved pastures there are rushes,   
 where there is better grazing.  In the
 marshy parts, cotton flowers flourish 
 in spring, and later wild yellow iris 
 form a splash of colour just to the   
 side of the road above the reservoir. 
 The woodland in the north-east is     
 mainly deciduous and there is some new
 planting of beech copses, extending up
 the inflow stream at the bend of the  
 Tockholes road.  This has been done by
 the North West Water Authority.
