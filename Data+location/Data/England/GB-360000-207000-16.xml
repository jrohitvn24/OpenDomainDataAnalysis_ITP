		<title>16Swimming At Parkend School</title>
		<content> On Wednesdays we go swimming and I    
 think it is fun.We go on a bus to     
 Cinderford to Heyward Comprehensive   
 School.We have three different groups 
 of children - learners, where the     
 infants get used to the water; the    
 middle group who can all swim a little
 bit and who are trying to improve and 
 the top group who can all swim at     
 least 25 metres and are learning to   
 dive and how to different strokes.In  
 the summer we also have a Swimming    
 Gala where different Forest Of Dean   
 Primary Schools join together.It      
 doesn't matter if we win or lose      
 because it is only for fun.
