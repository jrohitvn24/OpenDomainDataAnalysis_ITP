		<title>13Newperran Tourist Park</title>
		<content> Newperran Tourist Park is between     
 the villages of Goonhavern,Rejerrah   
 and Rose. It is out in the country but
 quite near to the beaches of Perran-  
 porth and Newquay. We visited this    
 site in June. We saw 12 fields marked 
 out for campers. It looked very clean 
 with all the facilities campers would 
 need. There are free heated swimming  
 and paddling pools.There are swings,  
 roundabouts,see-saws,slides,an adven- 
 ture playground and a full size       
 tractor to play on. There is a shop,  
 cafe,off licence,baby rooms, launder- 
 ette and a ladies hairdressing room.  
 There is course fishing at Trevella.  
 They have rules like all dogs are to  
 be kept on leads, no noise after 10pm 
 and a speed limit of 5m.p.h.There are 
 lots of pubs nearby. It used to be a  
 farm but the people make more money   
 from having  holiday makers.          </content>
