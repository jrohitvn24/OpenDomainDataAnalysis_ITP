		<title>04New Forest-Deer and Trains</title>
		<content> I visited{Hawkhill}with my family and 
 we saw some deer. We had to be very   
 quiet otherwise the deer would not    
 come out of the woods. The deer were  
 brown with beige spots. We saw a lot  
 of deer. When the trains come the deer
 are frightened.                       
 The engine driver of the train waved  
 to me and sounded his horn. The train 
 went very fast. We crossed over the   
 railway tracks at the level crossing. 
 We saw more deer on this side. The    
 deer could hide from us and the trains
 in the trees. The trees also shade    
 them from the sun in the summer.      
 We had a picnic and I played games    
 with my big brother.
