		<content> Stepping into the Post Office at      
 Michaelchurch is like stepping back in
 time.It still has the{original        
{shelving and effects}from when it was 
 one of the two shops in the           
 village.Then it was called "Mill      
 House" and at the rear of the house   
 you can still see the{old bread oven }
 which 3 times a day baked 30x4lb and  
 6x2lb loaves.This oven used wood or   
 gorse to heat it.                     
    Back in 1935 the owner bought up   
 "Church Cottage" ,a hardware and      
 haberdashery shop,in order to close   
 down local competition for trade.     
     Today its main trade comes through
 the{postal services}it offers. A few  
 foodstuffs,especially{sweets,}are kept
 but it is not by any stretch of the   
 imagination a village grocery shop.The
 present Postmistress,Mrs.Smith has    
 lived in the area for 36 years.       </content>
