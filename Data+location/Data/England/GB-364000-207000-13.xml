		<title>13BLAKENEY RED PEARS</title>
		<content>   Blakeney Red pears are small, hard  
 and dry tasting. They are used for    
 making cider and wine. To make perry  
 the pears have to be cleaned but to   
 make cider with apples and Blakeney   
 Reds it does not matter. Local people 
 stew the pears in lemonade. The pips  
 have to be black otherwise it tastes  
 sour. The fruit has to be pulped and  
 put into the press. Then the juice is 
 pumped into the barrels. It starts to 
 froth and after seven to eight weeks  
 it turns itself over then it's nearly 
 ready to drink. Local people believe  
 that the trees grow better on the     
 hillside, and produce better fruit.   
 Most of the trees are very old. New   
 ones are grown by grafting, and don't 
 fruit for 15 to 20 years. The Awre    
 Parish Council is planting some new   
 trees beside the A48 at Nibley because
 they are in danger of dying out.      </content>
