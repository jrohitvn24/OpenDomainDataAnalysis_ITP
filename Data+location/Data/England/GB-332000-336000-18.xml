		<title>18GAMES ON THE PIT MOUNT</title>
		<content> 'The{pit mount}is the biggest and most
 famous.The other two are called the   
 mini pit and the B.M.X.track.If I had 
 to move away from the village I would 
 never forget the pit as it means a lot
 to me.In the summer we go to the{pit  
{mount}for{picnics}and afterwards play 
 games like{tig}and{hide and seek.}Then
 we go down to the{waterfall.'         
 'I think that if the{pit mount}wasn't 
 there, there would be nothing to do.No
 really{good walks}to take your dog or 
 puppy on.I have a puppy and up there  
 it's safe for me to let him off the   
 lead.In the winter when there is snow 
 on the ground it's great for{sledging.
 We use peat bags or plastic bags.'    
 'My dad used to go{jogging}up there   
 and I go to{fly my kite.'             
 'Sometimes we just go up there for a  
{rest}and{quiet.'
