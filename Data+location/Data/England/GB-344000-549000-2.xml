		<title>02VILLAGE HALL,COTEHILL</title>
		<content> In one of the squares in the          
 block there's a village called        
 Cotehill with a village hall which is 
 used for lots of things like          
 bingo,dancing,disco,committees and the
 over 60-club.There's a committee that 
 looks after the village hall.They are 
 based in the hall.Discos come every so
 often to the village hall.I go to a   
 lot of them.They are always on a      
 Friday night.The village hall is quite
 big.It has stage.There's a coffee room
 ,a main room,kitchen,two toilets and a
 little hall at the front.It has two   
 doors.Our school uses the village hall
 for P.E. because the school hasn't got
 a room big enough room for it.There   
 used to be  keep fit.They have shows  
 every April.We used to have a youth   
 club but we moved to the chapel       
 because they couldn't pay the heating 
 bill.                                 </content>
