 GET OUT OF BED AT ABOUT 8 O CLOCK.I   
 HAVE TOAST OR CEREAL FOR BREAKFAST.I  
 USUALLY CALL ROUND FOR MY FRIENDS     
 AND WE PLAY.SOMETIMES WE GO WALKING.WE
 COLLECT TADPOLES AND INSECTS.I HAVE A 
 BIKE.IT IS A BMX BIKE.SOME OF MY      
 FRIENDS HAVE BIKES AND WE GO CYCLING  
 TOGETHER.WE SOMETIMES PLAY FOOTBALL IN
 THE PARK OR IN THE STREET.WE HAVE TO  
 BE CAREFUL IN THE STREET BECAUSE OF   
 THE TRAFFIC.ON HOT DAYS WE PLAY       
 CRICKET.WE ALSO HAVE A GAME CALLED    
 HIDE AND SEEK.ONE PERSON COVERS THEIR 
 EYES AND THE OTHERS HIDE.THEN THE     
 PERSON MUST FIND ALL THE OTHERS BEFORE
 THEY CAN GET BACK TO HIS SPOT.        
 SOMETIMES WE PLAY THIS GAME ON OUR    
 BIKES.SOME DAYS I GO SHOPPING WITH MY 
 MAM AND DAD.I'M OLD ENOUGH NOW TO GO  
 TO THE SHOPS FOR MY MAM ON MY OWN.
