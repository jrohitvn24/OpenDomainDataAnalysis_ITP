		<title>11THE OLD RAILWAY</title>
		<content> The land in this area varied a great  
 deal.All the fields in the area are   
 used for crops,but there were no      
 animals in the fields because the     
 fields were for Arable farming.One    
 field looked like grass,but turned out
 to be sweet-peas.                     
    Another area was derelict,it was   
 where an old railway used to be,the   
 track that used to connect Lincoln    
 and Grantham.It is very rocky and in  
 some place very muddy.This square     
 contains an old tower in a dereiict   
 brick yard, 2 gas holders near the    
 common land,known as the south common,
 (which is also in this square)which   
 has a golf course,and an area where   
 ponies can graze.Near here is         
 Coningsby Crescent-a residential area,
 and a hotel named Eardley's hotel.    
{ The Viking Way}passes through this   
 area.                                 </content>
