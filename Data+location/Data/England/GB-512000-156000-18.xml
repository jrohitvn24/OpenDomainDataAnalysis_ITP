		<title>18Fetcham:Computers and Videos</title>
		<content> COMPUTERS:Over the years computers    
 have became more popular,the price    
 more reasonable and so more people are
 buying them.I made this survey out of 
 twenty-three people.The most popular  
 computer was the ZX Spectrum with six 
 people.Fourteen people have computers.
 My school has three computers.We've   
 got two BBC'S and a ZX 81.            
 VIDEOS:Out of twenty-three people,    
 fifteen people owned videos.The       
 most popular was VHS.Only one person  
 in my class has a Betamax.Once again  
 I did a survey.Five years ago only two
 people in my class owned a video,where
 as two years ago ten people had a     
 video.But this year two people have   
 bought videos.Most videos cost over   
 300 pounds.
