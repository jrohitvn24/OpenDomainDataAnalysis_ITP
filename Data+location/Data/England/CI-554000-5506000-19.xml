		<content>  In Alderney there are twelve hotels -
 nine of them are fully licensed and   
 two residential and restaurant        
 licensed.The number of hotel beds is  
 226 though in winter most of the      
 hotels close.All the guest houses     
 together can sleep 106 people.Self    
 catering has become increasingly      
 popular and 16 people and businesses  
 have property available.There is a    
 very attractively sited camping site  
 which is reasonably priced though     
 facilities are rather limited.Tents   
 can be hired at the site.             
   Many visitors in the summer are     
 relatives of people living on the     
 island and stay as their guests.Even  
 more important every year are the     
 people who sail in and bring their own
 accomodation with them(their boats!)
