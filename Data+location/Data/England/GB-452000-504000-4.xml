		<title>04Living in Kirkby and Busby</title>
		<content>   The area where I live is between    
{ Kirby}and{Busby.}It is called        
 Dromonby. Dromonby goes back to the   
 medival times and when{William the 1st
 invaded. There are only four buildings
 the house, hall, cottage and coach    
 house. The big house was owned by the 
{Dobsons,}they lived there for years.  
 The old hall dates back to norman     
 times, but now is been made into a    
 luxury house. The house is now very   
 modern and is having tennis courts    
 built in the paddock. In Kirby there  
 is a church and a good post office.   
 Kirby is a very old village and has a 
 Public house. The village now has     
 about thirty modern houses. There are 
 still old houses in Kirby.{The name   
{Kirby dates back to the vikings.}It is
 a small country village, surrounding  
 it is  the Wainstones, Cold moor and  
 Cringly.                              </content>
