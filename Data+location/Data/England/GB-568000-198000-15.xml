		<content> The Present secretary of Stock        
 Cricket Club is Tony Bradbury         
 and they field four teams whose       
 members live in or around Stock.During
 the First World War no Cricket was    
 played because the cricket ground was 
 used by the army as an Artillery      
 Range.After the war the War Office    
 payed Â£10.11 shillings to repair the  
 pitch. The unemployed men in the      
 village did the work.50 years ago     
 houses in Stock had no piped water.The
 foot path to the village pump ran     
 right across the middle of the pitch  
 so the game often had to be stopped   
 while villagers went to collect       
 water.The pitch is on common land with
 rent payable to Lord Petre of         
 Ingatestone Hall.
