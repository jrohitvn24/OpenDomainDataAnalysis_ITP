		<title>03HULLBRIDGE</title>
		<content> Hullbridge is a place with lots of    
 houses  and lots of shops.It is very  
 hilly and lots of people live         
 there.There is hardly any grass or    
 field land.When we went to Hullbridge 
 we made a long list of shops down     
 Ferry Road.Also we made a list of how 
 many banks and other shops there      
 were.It was very tiring walking down  
 Ferry Road because it is so long but  
 we enjoyed looking at the shops and   
 seeing the different names.Some of the
 names were quite stange like Seperate 
 Ways,Budgen,The Ferry Pharmacy,Ivory  
 Cosmetics,Claydons,The Ferry Fishers  
 and the Sweat Oak.Down Ferry Road     
 there are 22 shops.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
