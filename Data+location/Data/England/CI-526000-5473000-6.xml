		<content> the area when asked said that it was  
 worth every inconvenience, as they    
 felt that if the roads were widened it
 would spoil the image and effect of   
 the area.                             
                                       
    The cliff paths in the area are all
 kept in good repair without having to 
 be tarmaced. They are kept wide enough
 so as to cause no inconvenience with  
 people passing each other. On average 
 the paths are one to two metres wid   
 One major factor is that all folliage 
 and plants are kept trimed at all     
 times and not left to overgrow and    
 overhang the pathway.                 
                                       
    Transport plays a very important   
 part in the life and income of the    
 island, including the tomato growing  
 and tourism industries.
