		<title>05SETTLEMENT SITE 2, HOCKLIFFE</title>
		<content> Towards the end of the{Middle Ages}the
 hill settlement of early Hockliffe    
 became deserted. The nearby{Roman     
{Watling Street (A5)}became used as a  
{Drovers Road}to move cattle from{Wales
 to the{London markets}.{Inns such as  
 the{Falcon,}the{Unicorn}and the{Cross 
{Keys}whose sites have long been       
 forgotten, were built on either side  
 of the road because the{drovers}needed
 nourishment.                          
  By the time the{eighteenth century   
{coaching era}arrived Hockliffe could  
 boast some{thirteen inns.} The area   
 around the inns grew in size and      
 population. This settlement is        
 called{lateral development}because it 
 has grown on either side of the{A5.}  
 1985, this second and larger site of  
 Hockliffe maintains its linear        
 development, with four of the original
 inns used as pubs.                    </content>
