		<content> 3 sayings from the area.  "If there   
 are 2 funerals in a week then there   
 will be three in the fortnight.""A    
 green Christmas makes a full          
 churchyard." If some-one fails to do  
 something properly then a sympathetic 
 by-stander may well say "Tha' didna'  
 hod tha' moth reet." ie "you didn't   
 hold your mouth in the correct way for
 that particular job." Pilling Coffee  
 Feast now resembles the local Galas   
 (pronunced "gaylas") like Preesall    
 Gala.In the past it centred round the 
 church.Now there is a Rose Queen,a    
 procession,sports,morris dancing,and  
 lots to eat for the children.The      
 origin is medieval,a survival of the  
 village "feast" to celebrate the      
 Saint's Day of the parish church.A    
 couple of Centuries ago it was the    
 custom to give children coffee to eat 
 with their buns,hence the name.       </content>
