		<content>   Most people in the area have their  
 own cars.  Buses run three or four    
 times a day to Leamington and Kineton.
   In Chadshunt there is one public    
 telephone box and one post box. Most  
 houses have private phones.           
   Public footpaths are seldom used,   
 poorly signposted and have been       
 ignored by farmers.                   
   Since there is little to keep people
 in the area by way of employment and  
 recreation, most people commute       
 heavily. The main centres that people 
 look towards are Kineton (a small     
 town) and Leamington, where they will 
 travel for shops, work, entertainment.
