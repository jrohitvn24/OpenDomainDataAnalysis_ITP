		<title>05The new school.</title>
		<content>     From 1968, the village began to   
 grow, and a lot of new estates were   
 built. The numbers in the school grew 
 every year. Four temporary classrooms 
 were built, but in 1982 it was decided
 to build a new school at the back of  
 the old building.                     
     A new playground was made, and a  
 large hall and kitchen were built on  
 the old playground. On the original   
 school field four new classrooms were 
 built. The rooms are carpeted, with   
 large windows.                        
     The two large old classrooms were 
 altered, given larger windows and     
 modernised, and the small clasroom    
 became our new library.               
     One temporary classroom block was 
 retained, to be used as a classroom   
 and a music/needlework room.          
     We now have three infant classes  
 and four junior classes.              </content>
