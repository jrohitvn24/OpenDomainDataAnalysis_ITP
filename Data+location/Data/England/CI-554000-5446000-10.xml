		<title>10A farmer's life.</title>
		<content>   Mr.Peter Bisson was born at "The    
 Poplars" which is a farm his family   
 has owned since 1690. He showed us the
 deeds that were writen on pigskin, and
 has the names of Sarah Josue          
 Bisson. He farms 65 vergees (30       
 acres), with the aid of               
 machines, by himself. After 1945 he   
 grew tomatoes and potatoes but, with  
 the advent of glasshouses, he changed 
 to growing cauliflowers. Then         
 he moved to spring vegetables and     
 later to winter ones. He now grows rye
 in order to rotate his crops. He keeps
 cockerels and 4 pigs for home         
 consumption. He used to have a direct 
 selling vegetable store but now has a 
 tea-room instead.  Bread is baked on  
 the premises at the rate of 100 loaves
 a day.He has 5 children and hopes a   
 son will take on the farm.
