		<title>16COLD NORTON M.O.T CENTRE.</title>
		<content> The M.O.T centre has been working for 
 three years   Before its 'present     
 use as an MOT Centre  the site was    
 a contractors .                       
   The centre tests ,on average, about 
 eight cars a day and of these         
 approximately thirty three            
 percent fail the M.O.T. Three people  
 work there. Their major tools consist 
 of a bench grinder a valve facer, a   
 battery charger, a compresor, a       
 welder, a rolling road and two car    
 jacks. They have three thousand pounds
 worth of spanners. An MOT Centre tests
 how safe a car is. If it is unsafe it 
 fails, for example it would fail on   
 rotten suspension mountings or lights 
 that didn't work.  These faults then  
 have to be put right before the car   
 will be given its' certificate. All   
 cars over three years old have to be  
 tested once a year.                   </content>
