		<title>10THE HEYFORD HORNETS</title>
		<content>The Athletics Club is called the       
Heyford Hornets A. A. Club. The club   
has its own shirts and shorts with the 
name on them. Every Wednesday night the
children and the adults meet at the    
Green to train. The children pay 15p   
per week to the club. They start at    
6.30 and finish at 8.30. At the moment 
the club hasn't got any equipment but  
they do sponsored runs and fundraising.
Usually the adults put the children    
into these races. On Sundays the       
children usually run to Bugbrooke and  
back, a total of 3 miles. The Hornets  
had a float in the mini-carnival that  
started the {Village Hall Silver       
Jubilee Fete} on Sat 29th June. On     
Sun 30th June there was the annual     
Round the Village Road Race and many of
the Hornets entered. I won the Junior  
Girls' Race for the third year in      
succession.                            </content>
