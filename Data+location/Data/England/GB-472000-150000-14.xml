		<title>14THE BURY AND SURROUNDINGS</title>
		<content> The primary land cover around the area
 is farmland which is used for growing 
 cereal crops. The secondary land cover
 is mainly residential. Recreational   
 land covers the rest of the area, with
 many public foot-paths. The main      
 housing area borders the farmland and 
 there are many magnificent Oak and    
 Copper Beech trees scattered around.  
 Odiham Cricket Club is situated       
 nearby. Buryfield Infants' School is  
 in King Street, nearby in the Bury is 
 the Mayfield Junior School. Near the  
 school is the All Saints Parish Church
 surrounded by the churchyard. It is   
 the largest church in the  north-east 
 of Hampshire. At present the tower is 
 being repaired. The ancient Almshouses
 have recently been extended to house  
 more elderly folk in Odiham. Nearby   
 the Cottage Hospital has had a small, 
 new, out-patients' department built.  </content>
