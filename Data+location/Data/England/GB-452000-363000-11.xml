		<title>11A day in my life</title>
		<content>   At about 6.15a.m. I wake up,and go  
 downstairs for a cup of tea and to    
 watch television programmes, moving   
 pictures ona screen, on the video     
 cassettee recorder. My favourite shows
 are Ready Steady Go, 1960 music, and  
 Fame, about the people in the New York
 School of Arts. 7.15a.m. is the time I
 go to have a wash. I use soap,        
 flannel,toothbrush,toothpaste, and    
 towel. On schooldays I wear black     
 corduroy trousers, white socks, a     
 shirt or tea shirt and cardigan or    
 sweatshirt. I the go down for         
 breakfast and have eggs on toast with 
 several cups of tea. At approximately 
 8.30a.m. I set off to school with my  
 brother and sister. I arrive at school
 at 8.45a.m. and go straight into the  
 classroom and read or write the days  
 work. In the morning we have an       
 assembly to worship God.              </content>
