		<content>{EDUCATION.}Dunalley Street Primary    
 School is a very old school,built in  
 1859. The school is mainly one large  
 building, we have a hall and canteen. 
 The canteen was built during the      
 Second World War when it was used as  
 an emergency feeding centre for those 
 people whose homes had been bombed.   
  In the morning we have Assembly when 
 we have hymns and prayers. Sometimes  
 we listen to records or to children   
 playing flutes,clarinets and recorder 
  We have milk during morning playtime 
 At lunchtime some have a hot school   
 dinner (cost 65p),some bring their own
 sandwiches and others go home.        
  Like other schools we enjoy school   
 trips. This year we went to Slimbridge
 Wildfowl Centre.
