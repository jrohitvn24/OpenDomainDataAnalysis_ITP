 Hundreds of people were affected by   
 the miners strike. One night before I 
 went to bed I checked the coal in the 
 coal shed. In the morning I checked it
 again and noticed half of it was gone 
 and I found a picket's badge on the   
 floor. I told my mum and she said that
 we would have to get a bolt on the    
 door so that no more coal would go.   
 During the strike the children of the 
 striking miners were getting toys and 
 clothes from miners in other countries
 like Sweden. They also got tickets to 
 see films. My dad said it wasn't fair 
 and that they should buy their own    
 tickets.
