		<content> Our unit is situated SW of Crewe Town 
 Centre. Even areas close to the town  
 are rural in character, having        
 well-matured trees in abundance.      
 Housing developments are pleasantly   
 designed and varied. There is a       
 predominance of farming and arable    
 land. The village communities are     
 Wistaston, Shavington, Rope, Basford  
 and Hough. The village of Shavington  
 is not the largest settlement but its 
 recorded history dates back to the    
 original Domesday Book, when it was   
 known as Santune. It is a true        
 community having a variety of local   
 shops, a Post Office, a Church and a  
 Chapel. The residents have a strong   
 community spirit. The block is an     
 extremely pleasant one; residents take
 pride in their houses and gardens and 
 it is therefore a sought-after area,  
 begirt with pretty countryside.       </content>
