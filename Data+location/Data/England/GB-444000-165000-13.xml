		<title>13GAMES WE PLAY</title>
		<content> In the playground at school we play   
 one two three in, it, ball games and  
 bulldogs.                             
                                       
 At home we play computer games, roller
 skating, cycling and skipping.        
                                       
 There is a ball game called           
 'sevensies'. To play this we do seven 
 throws against the wall without       
 dropping the ball; six throws against 
 the wall letting the ball bounce once;
 five bounces on the ground without    
 stopping; four throws under your leg  
 letting it bounce once; three bounces 
 on the ground and then against the    
 wall; two throws in the air; one throw
 against the wall turn around and catch
 the ball without dropping it.         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
