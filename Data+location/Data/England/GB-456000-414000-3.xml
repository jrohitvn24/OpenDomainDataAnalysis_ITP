		<content> In{Moss}there are some old people's   
 bungalows. They are modern and the    
 gardens and lawns are very nice. The  
{brickworks}closed down in the 1900's. 
 The last bricks that were made were   
 for the front of Doncaster Station.   
 The{Star Inn}(Pub) has been in the    
 same family for about 200 years. At   
 the back there is a small adventure   
 playground for the children. Sometimes
 this pub is the meeting place for{The 
{Hunt}before they start their run. The 
 railway is the main Edinburgh to      
 London line. It is quite busy. There  
 used to be a school in{Moss}but it    
 closed down in 1978. Also there used  
 to be a church but one was built in   
 Fenwick and the one in Moss closed    
 down in the early 1980's. The roads in
 Moss are very quiet but sometimes when
 bridges close down they become quite  
 busy.                                 </content>
