		<content>     At home the entertainment is quite
good.  I usually entertain myself by   
watching television, working on the    
farm, playing cards or riding my bike. 
                                       
     There are not a lot of leisure    
activities outside the home.  There is 
just the pub, but they are meant to be 
building a BMX track in the old school 
yard.  They are starting a Youth Club  
in the school which is closed down.    
                                       
     Country and Westerns are usually  
held once a month in the old tin       
village hall which has a lot of        
facilities, like a stage and toilets.  
There are groups and solos which reach 
quite a high standard.  There is also  
a bar which sells bar snacks and       
drinks. Most of the villagers come and 
they have a really good time.
