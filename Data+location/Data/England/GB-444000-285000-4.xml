		<title>04WIBTOFT VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The village has about 19 dwellings and
 a population of about 50.             
 The dwellings are a mixture of modern 
 detached houses, old terraced         
 cottages, old farmhouses and modern   
 terraced houses.                      
 Two of the cottages are Elizabethan in
 origin.                               
 There is a large potato farm in the   
 village. They not only grow there own 
 potatoes, but also buy them in for    
 resale.                               
 Until recently the village and        
 surrounding land was owned by a family
 called Marvin. They also are the      
 present owners of the above mentioned 
 potato farm.                          
 The village dates back to Viking      
 times, the Vikings went upstream from 
 the Humber estuary and got as far     
 Wibtoft, the watershed of England.
