		<title>06THE LAUGHTON COUNTRYSIDE</title>
		<content> Laughton is in the heart of Sussex and
 is surrounded by the South Downs. A   
 typical view of the landscape would   
 comprise open farmland, with perhaps  
 some areas of woodland.               
 In one of the fields there is a flock 
 of rooks which can be seen every day. 
 Magpies and jays are also very        
 common.                               
 There are over a hundred different    
 types of tree in Laughton, including  
 oaks, spruce, ash, willow, pine and   
 fruit trees such as apple, pear,      
 cherry and damson.                    
 The number of rabbits has increased in
 recent years: they are now very       
 common. Grey squirrels can be         
 frequently seen. Foxes, hedgehogs and 
 other small mammals inhabit the area. 
 Grass snakes can be seen in the local 
 fields.                               
                                       </content>
