 The sports we play in Chalford are    
 tennis,football,cricket,badminton and 
 rounders.Tennis and badminton can be  
 played with two or four players.      
 Football is a good team-game and so is
 netball.There are two teams in a      
 football match,with eleven players on 
 each side.Netball has two teams of    
 seven and rounders two teams of nine  
 players.For this game you have to hit 
 a hard ball with a narrow bat and run 
 round a circle of posts to score a    
 rounder.Cricket is a summer game for  
 two teams of eleven.One bats and the  
 other fields.The idea is to hit the   
 ball and score runs.All these games   
 can be played at the Chalford Sports  
 and Social Club.We also have school   
 competitions of football,netball and  
 rounders when we play against other   
 schools in the district.              </content>
