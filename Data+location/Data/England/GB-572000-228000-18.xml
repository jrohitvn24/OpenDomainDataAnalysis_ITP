		<content>      An invitation to comment on the  
{W.I. questionaire}sent to all the     
 houses in{Shalford}produced these:    
      "Living in an area of delightful 
 countryside, it is worth noting that  
 very few people appear to view and    
 enjoy it 'au pied'. Most people seem  
 to drive even the shortest of         
 distances. It might be reasonable to  
 observe therefore, some rural areas   
 are in danger of becoming 'dormitory  
 villages'. However,in this area there 
 are many groups and organisations, run
 and supported by local residents which
 clearly helps to guard against that   
 situation developing to its most      
 extreme."                             
      "I think we need a machine to buy
 time! There are so many opportunities 
 open especially to teen-agers who seem
 to fill every moment of their waking  
 time."                                </content>
