		<content> Two of{Thomas Hardy's}major novels are
 set in the area. One called{"The      
{Return of the Native"}is set on{Egdon 
{Heath}(Hardy's name for{Puddletown}and
{Bhompston Heaths}). At the time which 
 he set the story, these were not      
 covered with trees, as now, but were  
 covered by rough grass, heath, furze  
 and scrubby trees. The inhabitants of 
 neighbouring villages would get some  
 rough grazing there for their animals 
 and to encourage the growth of grass, 
 would clear the furze and burn it. The
 bonfires from furze burning are       
 mentioned several times in the novel. 
 The principal characters are the      
 Yeobrights who lived at{"Blooms-End". 
 This has been identified with         
{Bhompston Farm.}Another place         
 mentioned is the{"Quiet Woman Inn"    
 which is tentatively identified as    
{Duck Dairy House.                     </content>
