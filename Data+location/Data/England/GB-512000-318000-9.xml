		<content>    The one{major source of employment}
 in this area is the separate foundry/ 
 scrapyard and haulage businesses owned
 and managed by the brothers{Laud}of   
{South Fen}near Tongue End, Bourne who 
 live and work on adjoining properties.
 Very often the total number of workers
 is in excess of seventy, more than the
 total population of the area.         
    The{foundry}is sited to the rear of
 a fairly large scrapyard.Lorries bring
 the scrap metals/objects to the yard  
 where it is separated and the iron    
 sent to the foundry for smelting. The 
 molten metal is then made into manhole
 and drain covers for resale all over  
 the country.The unused scrap is taken 
 by lorry to Dover or Felixstowe for   
 shipment to many European countries.  
    Next door, the{haulage business}is 
 run as a separate company to the      
 owner's farm.                         </content>
