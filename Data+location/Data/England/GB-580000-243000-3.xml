		<content>   The village is really just the one  
 main street. Some little old cottages 
 have been demolished in favour of     
 modern bungalows; but, since being    
 designated a Conservation Area, the   
 centre cannot be altered much. The C15
 Hall still has part of its defensive  
 moat. The biggest house is the early  
 Victorian old Rectory; the Lodge at   
 its gate is pretend Tudor. The only   
 shop and the blacksmith's forge have  
 had to close, and so has the little   
 brewery - but the red brick arched    
 entrance remains. The windmill - gone.
 The Congregational Chapel is now used 
 as a garage. There used to be a spire 
 on top of the church tower; it was    
 blown off in a freak whirlwind. Among 
 saints painted on the rood screen is  
 Apollonia, carrying some forceps; she 
 kept her faith though her teeth were  
 pulled out - dentists' patron saint!  </content>
