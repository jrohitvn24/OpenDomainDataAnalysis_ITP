		<title>13FARMING IN MARSTON.</title>
		<content>{Burnt Mill Farm}has been owned and    
 farmed by the Ward family for 30      
 years. They breed cows on the farm    
 and there are about 100 in all. The   
 calves are sold after a year. Mr Ward 
 owns about 30 acres of grassland.     
 He thinks the farm is too small to    
 warrant use of computers.             
                                       
{Park Farm}is called this because of   
 the University Parks nearby. The farm 
 buildings were built in about 1900. It
 is a livestock farm with 100 acres of 
 grassland. They use modern machines   
 but not computers for the paperwork.  
 They sell the calves at the market in 
 Banbury.                              
                                       
 There are 4 other farms in Marston,   
{Cannons Farm, Hill Farm, Colthorns}   
{Farm}and{Cherwell Farm.}
