		<content> Langwathby  School is a large  primary
 school  with a  nursery. We  have 175 
 children and 8 teachers.It has been an
 area school for twelve years. Children
 from thirteen  different villages come
 to our school because  smaller schools
 have  closed. Most of them  travel by 
 special  bus,some of them  come by car
 or walk. Edenhall school closed before
 Langwathby school was extended so they
 had  to  go to  Penrith. Parents  are 
 always  welcome to  help at  school in
 various ways, hearing reading, backing
 books, helping with needlework, craft,
 art and classifying  the library. They
 help to raise  funds for extra  equip-
 ment and activities. It is a church of
 England  school. The  vicar  comes and
 takes an assembly every week and stays
 to  teach  the  upper  juniors. We all
 have  to  go  to  secondary  school in
 Penrith when we are eleven.           </content>
