		<content> Transport in the Maplesteads and      
 Wickham St.Paul. Transport has changed
 considerably for those living in this 
 rural area and now people are much    
 more dependent on the motor car.Buses 
 no longer run at all in               
 Gt.Maplestead,although Wickham        
 St.Paul still has four buses a week   
 going to nearby towns. In order to    
 overcome the problem of lack of       
 transport particularly for the        
 elderly,Eastern National buses run a  
 Country Car.This seven seater car     
 takes people between Halstead and     
 Lt.Maplestead and Gt.Maplestead on a  
 Tuesday and Friday.The cost of 70p    
 single Â£1.05 return is however        
 prohibitive to many old people.The    
 Parish Council now is looking into    
 ways of producing a volutary service  
 to transport people to Halstead.
