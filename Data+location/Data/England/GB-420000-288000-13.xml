		<content>  Maxstoke Mill,at Dukes End was built 
 in the 1780's.The original mill is on 
 the River Blythe,since then no changes
 have been made.It is about the same   
 age as Blythe Mill but it is more     
 derelict.Maxstoke Mill stopped working
 in 1949 because farmers began to use  
 more modern machinery to grind their  
 corn.Mr Jones doesn't own Maxstoke    
 Mill but he is the manager of it.The  
 owner of Maxstoke Mill is Captain     
 Fetherston-Dilke.This family have     
 owned the land and mill since the     
 14thC the last people to live in the  
 mill was the Antrobus family.Mr Jones 
 told us that it would take about 30-40
 thousand pounds to restore the mill.Mr
 Jones also farms the land around the  
 mill.He owns 110 cows and farms 280   
 acres of{arable}and{pasture}land.
