		<title>18THE VILLAGE SHOP</title>
		<content> There are two small sub-post office-  
 shops in this area.One is the village 
 shop at Swaffham Bulbeck.             
 Altogether seven people work in the   
 shop.Including 4 part time.           
 They get most of their stock from     
 Copeman and Ridley.It makes supplies  
 from Iswitch.They also deliver things.
  The shop is owned by Mr. and Mrs.    
 Upton.Their hours are : on weekdays   
 7am-6pm and on Saturdays 7.30am-1pm.  
 The post office is at the far end of  
 the shop and is small but most of the 
 village uses it.They sell stamps and  
 have a small post-office bank account.
  The sub-post-office-shop all in all  
 is very handy for the people of the   
 village                               
      Unfortunately for the village    
 shop most people get their groceries  
 from supermarkets in Cambridge and    
 Newmarket.                            </content>
