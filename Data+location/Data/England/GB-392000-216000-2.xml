		<content>{                                      
 Fruit growing was{formerly the main   
{occupation of farmers}immediately to  
 the west of the escarpment in the     
 valley.                               
{Apples, plums and cherries}were grown 
 in abundance and a{Cherry Picking Fair
 in July or late June brought many     
 visitors to Shurdington and children  
 were{given a holiday from school}to   
 help with the harvest.                
 Most orchards have made way for       
{housing developments}but there is     
 still evidence of the old apple and   
 plum orchards, now greatly reduced in 
 area, and cherries have disappeared   
 altogether.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
