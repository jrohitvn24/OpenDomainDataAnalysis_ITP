		<title>03HISTORY OF ST ERME CHURCH</title>
		<content> There is mention of a church in St    
 Erme in the original Domesday book.It 
 was in the manor of Alwin.The style   
 and openings in the southern wall of  
 the church suggest it is of Saxon     
 origin.When a church was first built  
 on the site must be open to           
 conjecture.                           
 During the 18 century St Erme church  
 fell into disrepair,like so many other
 churches in the country.During the    
 reign of George 111 the church was    
 rebuilt.                              
 In 1905 the church underwent a further
 rebuilding.                           
 During early 1985 the parish of St.   
 Erme was incorporated into the team   
 ministry of Probus.One member of the  
 team, Rev.A.Wright,had moved into a   
 house on the new estate during 1984.
