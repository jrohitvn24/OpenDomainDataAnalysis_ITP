		<title>13TWO FACTORIES - HAMPTON HILL</title>
		<content> Work shops are not a prominent feature
 in this area which is largely         
 residential. However we discovered two
 in Hampton Hill                       
 1. ABC ENGINEERING                    
 make hydraulic components of steel.   
 Handsaws are used for cutting steel.  
 Goods are mainly sent to local        
 outlets.300 pieces are made daily by  
 7 workers who get to work mainly by   
 public transport or walking to the    
 factory. Reported to be in decline and
 not a good place for young people     
 wanting jobs.                         
 2.LONGFORD TOOLS LTD.                 
 makes press tools of steel produced by
 British Steel Corporation. A lathe is 
 used and goods are sent worldwide. 12 
 pieces are produced each month by 6   
 shop floor workers and 1 office clerk.
 They get to work by cycling.
