		<title>11ST. MARY'S CHURCH NORTHOLT</title>
		<content> Situated on an ancient mound, in a    
 conservation area, stands the Parish  
 Church of St. Mary's Northolt.        
 Looking out from the church one can   
 see the{Race Course Estate}and Central
 London.  Serving an urban parish of   
 40,000 people it acts as 'an oasis of 
 peace in a jungle of noise'.  Due to  
 increasing{vandalism}and break-ins the
 church now remains locked.  This was  
 not the case 20 years ago.  The       
 congregation is drawn from Northolt   
 and Southall and{attendance}at all but
 Evensong is increasing.  The average  
 attendance for Morning Service is     
 between 12 - 20 and for Family        
 Eucharist 100, with between 50 - 60   
 communicants.  There has been         
 Christian Worship at St. Mary's for   
 over 700 years, and it is expected    
 that this will continue into the      
 future.                               </content>
