  On the 24th May,1985 the Queen came  
  to open Furness General Hospital.As  
 well as going to open the hospital she
 came to visit Ulverstons'Cumbria      
 Crystal factory and Urswick Grammar   
 School.To reach Urswick she passed    
 near Pennington and I went to see     
 her.Before she appeared the police    
 cleared the street and then some      
 policemen on motorbikes went past and 
 two police vans.Then a car with       
 Ladies-in-waiting in went past.Finally
 the Queens7 car came.I saw the        
 Queen.The Queen was in green.She was  
 wearing a mint hat with a net on and a
 mint jacket and scirt and gloves.After
 she had driven past a lot of other    
 cars with important people in went    
 past.Later all the ordinary cars      
 started to drive on the road again.
