		<content>There are 2 farms in Deene;-Home Farm, 
which is farmed on a partnership basis 
by Mr Brudenell,Lord of the Manor,and  
Mr Saunders,winner of the 1983 Grand   
National.The farm is almost entirely   
arable,with a few sheep in Deene Park. 
Manor Farm is a mixed farm with 1100   
acres of arable and 700 acres of grass.
Because of the large acreage of        
reclaimed ground (iron-ore quarries)the
emphasis at Manor Farm is placed on    
grazing-with 500 cattle and 700 sheep. 
There are 150 milking cows on the farm,
which calve from Sept. to Christmas.   
Lambing starts in January and goes on  
until March.During May and June Silage 
making takes priority.July until Sept. 
is harvest time.Three brothers run the 
Manor Farm, and they employ five other 
workers.
