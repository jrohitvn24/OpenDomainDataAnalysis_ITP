 From 1873 when work first began,up to 
 1893, 40,761 tonnes of lead were      
 extracted from the{mines.}There       
 were three main{lead}veins; the Joicey
 shaft,St.Andrew's vein and Bewick vein
 Of these, the Bewick vein was the     
 largest and was 4,400 ft.long and     
 about 175 ft.wide.Today, all that     
 remains of a once-valuable mine are   
 two{spoil heaps.}These are heaps of   
 waste and mud which came up with the  
 lead.these heaps are very             
 valuable,however and were last        
 estimated to be worth 5 million pounds
 The heaps are valuable because of the 
{lead}and{barytes}they still contain.  
 Various companies have taken interest 
 in the heaps, and plan to extract the 
{lead}and{barytes}which is used on{oil 
{rigs.}                                
                                       </content>
