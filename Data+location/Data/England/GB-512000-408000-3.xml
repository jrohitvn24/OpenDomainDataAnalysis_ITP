		<title>03BROCKLESBY PARK SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The school is comprised of two        
 teachers,myself(head) and Mrs. Wall   
 who is responsible for the infants.   
 At present we have 39 children on roll
 many of whom come from the village of 
 Limber. Children from outlying homes  
 are trasnsported to school by coach   
 each day. The school day begins at    
 0845 and ends at 1500 with an hour for
 lunch.                                
 With so few children on roll there is 
 a great danger that the school may one
 day be forced to close. Closure nearly
 took place in 1982 when the number of 
 children fell to 27. Had it not been  
 for the influence of the Earl of      
 Yarborough the school would have had  
 to close.                             
 Chidren bring a packed lunch to school
 each day as there are now no catering 
 facilities. Mrs.Wall is intending to  
 purchase the school house this year.  </content>
