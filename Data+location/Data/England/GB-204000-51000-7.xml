		<content>     Employment in the Par area is very
 low. There are few major employers,   
 but many small ones. Although there   
 aren't many employers in Par, il must 
 be noted that many people work in the 
 nearby centre of St. Austell, and the 
 china clay mines to the North-West.   
     The main employers are:- Par      
 E.C.C. docks, Carlyon Bay Leisure     
 World, major hotels in Carlyon Bay,   
 two garden centres, plant nurseries,  
 building and catering merchants,      
 garages and filling stations, a coch  
 firm, a manufacturing plant building  
 pressure hoses for E.C.C., two 'Sunday
 Markets', a craft centre, a           
 hospital dealing with disabled        
 children, and many small employers    
 such as shops, etc.                   
     Many jobs in Carlyon Bay and Par  
 are seasonal.
