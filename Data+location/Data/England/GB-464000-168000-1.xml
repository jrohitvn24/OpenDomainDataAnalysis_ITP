		<content>{Once primarily farmland, gravel       
{extraction and light industry now play
{a part in changing the landscape.     
{Farming still dominates.  Privately   
{owned farms exist along side several  
{managed by tennant farmers who lease  
{land from the Benyon family's         
{Englefield estate.  Cereal crops and  
{dairying predominate.  Gravel beds are
{plentiful.  Its extraction is a major 
{activity.  Newbury District Council   
{stipulate exhausted quarries must     
{revert to farmland although many have 
{been flooded to provide inland water  
{areas for recreation and conservation 
{of wildlife.  A recent feature is the 
{industrial estate funded by the       
{Norwich Union Insurance Co.  Units are
{leased to firms for manufacturing and 
{warehousing.  Wooded areas still exist
{and there is a feeling of resistance  
{to furthur development.               </content>
