		<content>   {ALLOTMENTS}                        
  Within our area is a large section   
 set aside for allotments. Many of our 
 dads, grandads and uncles have        
 allotments where they grow vegetables 
 and flowers in their spare time.      
  Some people have greenhouses on their
 allotments where they can grow        
 tomatoes, grapes, greenpeppers or     
 flowers. Others keep pigeons, rabbits 
 or hens. The pigeons are usually used 
 in races, and the rabbits can be taken
 to shows where the best one will get a
 prize.                                
  Many allotment holders grow leeks to 
 enter in the leek shows held in the   
 local clubs each September. In the    
 leek show you have to get the white of
 your leek at least 5 inches long and  
 as fat as possible and if you win you 
 get prizes or money.
