		<title>05LINTON MANOR HOUSE</title>
		<content> Linton Manor is named in the original 
 Domesday Book.It is said to be haunted
 by Dorothy De Bath.Her blood stain    
 marks the kitchen floor after she was 
 murdered by her lover.Her restless    
 spirit now haunts the manor drive and 
 spinney on a moonlight night.It takes 
 a brave man to walk past the manor at 
 night.The manor has twelve big rooms  
 two very big attics.Part of the       
 building is understood to be          
 Elizabethan.In 1910 Mr.John Beard     
 brought the manor and enlarged        
 it.About that time John Beard owned   
 part of Linton and Gresley and he     
 owned the brewery known as Beard and  
 Hill.The present owner is Mr.Julian   
 Whittaker.
