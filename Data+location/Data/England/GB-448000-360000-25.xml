<title>25Mansfield Town FC</title>
<content>May 2011 once again sees Mansfield Town visiting Wembley. After having been successful in the Freight Rover Trophy in 1987, defeating Bristol City on penalties, this time it's Darlington in the F.A. Trophy Final.&lt;br />&lt;br />The Field Mill ground was redeveloped during 2000-2001 season only to see the Stags fall out of the football league into the Blue Square Premier at the end of the 2007-2008 season.&lt;br />&lt;br />The Stags' 'goal' is to return to the football league but this past 3 seasons have seen them occupy a mid-table slot.&lt;br />&lt;br />Another 'goal' is to own their own ground which may even see them leaving Field Mill.&lt;br />&lt;br />Attendences are around the 2,000 mark.&lt;br />
