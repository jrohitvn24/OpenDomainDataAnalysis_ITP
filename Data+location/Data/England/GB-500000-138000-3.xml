<title>03Update about Hascombe</title>
<content>

Hascombe has changed very little since this description was written except that the vineyard no longer exists.  I have lived opposite the deer park, where the white deer still roam, since 1988.  We have a new village hall, completed in, I think 2001.  It has a large, fully equipped kitchen, a small meeting room upstairs, disabled toilets and changing rooms for the cricketers, on whose field it is now located and a large car park; all things the old village hall, located on the B2130 running through the village, never had.  Nanhurst School, mentioned as lying in the south east corner, closed and was converted into luxury apartments in 2000 set in communal grounds of approximately 7 acres.&lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
