		<title>16Shopping, N. Lopham</title>
		<content>     Shopping can sometimes be a       
 problem in a village, especially if   
 you don't have a car.  In North Lopham
 itself, there are two full_time shops 
 - a Post Office/Village Stores and a  
 Newsagents/Grocers.  There is         
 also a Butcher, open every morning.   
 The following mobile shops call in    
 vans: Fish _ Thursday, Ice Cream -    
 daily, Grocers - Tuesday, Bakers - 2  
 different firms cover every day       
 between them, Fish And Chips - Monday 
 and Friday.                           
      We did a small survey to find out
 which of the surrounding shopping     
 areas were used by parents of our     
 schoolchildren.  The most popular     
 shopping centre was Diss (7 miles),   
 followed in order of popularity by    
 North Lopham, Norwich (24 miles),     
 Thetford (13 miles) and Bury St.      
 Edmunds (18 miles).                   </content>
