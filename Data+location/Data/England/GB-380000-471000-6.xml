		<content> Horton in Ribblesdale has always been 
 a popular place for visitors and this 
 popularity continues to grow.         
 Penyghent, Ingleborough and Whernside 
 are known as the Three Peaks, and     
 Horton is an obvious starting and     
 finishing point for hikers walking the
 Three Peaks.  This is also the venue  
 for an annual running race and an     
 international cycle race, attracting  
 many participants and spectators.  The
 Pennine Way comes through Horton and  
 walkers find the village a convenient 
 place to stay overnight.  Fishermen   
 are attracted by the trout and salmon 
 in the River Ribble.  Many potholes   
 and cave systems in this limestone    
 area attract cavers.  The Norman      
 church also brings visitors.  Railway 
 enthusiasts form another group,       
 attracted by the Settle-Carlisle line 
 and steam engines.                    </content>
