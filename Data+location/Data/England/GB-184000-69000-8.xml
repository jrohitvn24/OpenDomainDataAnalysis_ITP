		<content> The Vet.around here can travel around 
 to see animals like cattle, sheep or  
 horses. What happens is you 'phone the
 Vet. and he or she will come to your  
 house and bring all the instruments he
 might use, then he will come and have 
 a look at the animal and decide what  
 to do. My pony was lame and he spent  
 half an hour looking for signs of what
 is wrong,then he found out and started
 to make a hole where the infection was
 in the hoof and then he found the     
 place and puss was pouring out.  He   
 made the decision and said it was a   
 thorn had gone in and then out and    
 left infection. The Vet. has never    
 left our farm without success.It is   
 more expensive to the Vet.to come over
 because of petrol etc.The Vets. are   
 kind and helpful and so is all his    
 staff.
