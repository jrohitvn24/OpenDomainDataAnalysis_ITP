 years old and he works for{Derek      
{Crouch}construction LTD.Derek Crouch  
 is a building company.My dads part is 
 a construction manager.He gets up     
 every morning at 6.45 and gets        
 washed.Then he has his breakfast and  
 at about 7.30 he goes to work.He has  
 to travel very far everyday.He is in  
 charge of all the other sites where   
 houses are being built.All the sites  
 are in the North East of England.The  
 main office is in Birtley Co.Durham.He
 drives a{Ford Granada}which is owned  
 by the firm.He usually gets back home 
 about 6.30pm.When he gets home he     
 sometimes has to make a lot of phone
