		<title>07Farm Survey (cont)</title>
		<content> Farming in Lockerley varies from area 
 to area because of the soil, the level
 of the land and the drainage. The soil
 is mainly clay, gravel and chalk. The 
 drainage is very good on the slopes of
 the valley but the river does flood.  
 Hence the existence of the water      
 meadows. The types of farm are dairy, 
 pig, beef, arable and sheep.          
                                       
 On Monday 24th June we visited Hatt   
 Farm grid ref. 318266. The farmer     
 breeds Hereford cross bulls for beef. 
 At first the bull calves are kept in  
 separate pens and fed on dried milk.  
 Then at ten weeks they are put        
 together and fed on concentrated nuts.
 At eight months they are moved further
 away from the farmhouse and fed on    
 silage and barley. At one year, they  
 are heavy enough to be sent for       
 slaughter (approx 425 kg).            </content>
