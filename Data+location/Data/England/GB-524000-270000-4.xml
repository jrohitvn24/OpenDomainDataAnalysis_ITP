 During the rebuilding of              
 Hinchingbrooke                        
 House in 1832     the skeletons of two
 nuns were found and are now on        
 exhibition at Hinchingbrooke Upper    
 School.There are several legends about
 this one of which is that when Henry  
 8th dissolved the monasteries two nuns
 escaped from the nunnery.They were    
 persued to a bridge by soldiers and   
 upon being surrounded jumped off the  
 bridge.Legend has it that each night  
 the nuns walk across the bridge.Two   
 more legends about Hinchingbrooke     
 House are (1)James 1st visited with   
 his son Charles who met Cromwell in   
 the garden and fought.(2)When Cromwell
 was young he visited his grandfather  
 at the house and a monkey is alleged  
 to have carried Cromwell across the   
 rooftops.                             </content>
