 We had to come back to school on      
 Friday at 6.20. All the Mums and Dads 
 were in the hall. We sat on the       
 blocks. We all had to wear our school 
 uniforms. We sang lots of songs. My   
 favourite songs were the cowboy songs 
 and the Trolley Song. The little ones 
 sang  There was a princess long ago   
 while I played it on the recorder. I  
 also had to play the triangle. We did 
 some Country dances. I did "Oh        
 Johnny". Then the leavers did a play, 
 it was funny. At 7.30 we went home.
