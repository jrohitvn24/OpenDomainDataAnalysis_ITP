		<title>12HOUSING</title>
		<content>  The housing in our block is a mixture
of ages and styles.In the countryside  
around Aldham you can see mostly       
cottages,some with thatched roofs and  
others with red tiles.Most of the walls
are construted with brick although a   
few are plaster covered.The cottages   
with thatched roofs and plaster walls  
were usually built before 1800.        
  Some of the houses we looked at were 
more regular in shape and design.They  
were Georgian brick houses built in the
1700's,as well as Victorian houses     
built in the late 1800's.Since 1920    
many new houses have been built;most of
them are semi-detached and on the edge 
of the town or on estates.They are     
usally built of brick and tile but some
are concrete framed.
