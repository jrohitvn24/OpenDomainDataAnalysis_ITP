   Apart from a little seasonal shrimp 
netting and trawling fishing is mainly 
whelk catching.                        
                                       
   Once the fleet consisted of open    
boats and converted lifeboats but now  
larger specially designed craft are    
used by the 5 crews operating from the 
East Quay.                             
Tides dictate the trips so each is up  
to 13 hours; the whelks are found up to
50 km off shore. The whelks are caught 
in pots baited with cod's heads, 40 to 
a line with a boat working 6 lines at a
depth of 30 metres. The lines are left 
on the sea bed between trips.          
On return to harbour the whelks are    
boiled in the Whelk Houses and         
despatched to markets mainly in the    
industrial towns of the Midlands and   
North.                                 </content>
