		<title>14Social Life Near Goonhavern.</title>
		<content> There is a tendancy to centre social  
 life in events in the area.This is    
 partially because of limited transport
 facilities; in many parts of the area 
 there is no public transport service  
 readily available in the evenings.It  
 is partially because of preference.   
 People enjoy meeting at coffee        
 mornings,garden parties and barbeques.
 Numerous events are held to compare   
 food,plants and flowers grown         
 locally.Groups meet to share and      
 develope country crafts and a lot of  
 enjoyment in derived from creating    
 attractive ornaments and displays for 
 the house.The Church is important and 
 most families attend at least on the  
 main festival days.Children are       
 encouraged to go to Sunday school.    
 Social activities connected with the  
 Church are numerous for both adults   
 and children.                         </content>
