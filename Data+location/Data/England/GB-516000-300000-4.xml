		<title>04THE HISTORY OF PASTON</title>
		<content>   At the time of the first Domesday   
 survey, Paston did not exist as an    
 area worthy of mention. A church has  
 been present since about 800 A.D. The 
 present church dating from 1217.Paston
 at the beginning of the century was a 
 small hamlet of around 30 houses, many
 of the inhabitants connected either   
 with the church or with farming.The   
 only buildings remaining of any age in
 1985 are the old rectory and Paston   
 Farm which is now used as a Youth and 
 Play Centre.A branch of the M. and G. 
 N. railway ran through Paston calling 
 at the brickworks at Dogsthorpe and   
 Eye Green.It closed many years ago    
 now.Paston was chosen as a development
 area by the Peterborough Development  
 Corporation.Paston School was built in
 1969. In 1972 the development of      
 housing estates began with a new      
 school,shops and health centre.       </content>
