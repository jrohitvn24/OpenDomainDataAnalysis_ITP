   The Staff &amp; Worcs Canal runs through
the centre of the area in a North-South
direction.                             
    It is no longer used for transport 
of bulky loads but is only used now for
recreation. Pleasure boats and canal   
narrow boats which have been converted 
into floating holiday homes travel up  
and down it. Often they tie up near    
the pumping station at Dimmingsdale    
Bridge.  Water from the canal feeds the
two pools used for fishing by private  
owners.                                
    Of course the canal itself is used 
by anglers who are not members of the  
angling club or do not wish to pay a   
fee other than the annual water board.
