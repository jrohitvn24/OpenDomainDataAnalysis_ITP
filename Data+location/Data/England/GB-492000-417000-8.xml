		<title>08WINTERTON, ATTITUDES</title>
		<content> Most people are satisfied with        
 Winterton because it is friendly. They
 like the shops but they don't like the
 dirty people and the litter. You can  
 buy most things in Winterton but there
 tends to be a wider choice in         
 Scunthorpe. Most people think it is a 
 shame there isn't a market any more. A
 majority wanted a chemist as the      
 nearest one is in Scunthorpe. Lots of 
 people wanted better sports facilities
 We already have some tennis courts at 
 the comprehensive and Rangers football
 field, which are used fairly well.    
 Winterton has more than doubled in    
 size in the past 15 years. There is an
 argument over whether to have a       
 playing field or not. A recent        
 referendum went against it but not    
 many voted. Bus services satisfy most 
 people. People go to Hull more often  
 now the Humber Bridge has opened.     </content>
