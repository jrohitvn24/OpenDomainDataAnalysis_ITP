		<title>12THE RAFT RACE</title>
		<content> During July every year a raft-race    
 takes place on Walney Island,from the 
 Ferry Hotel to Piel Island.The        
 distance covered is about 7.5 kms.The 
 race is organised for charity,at      
 present the majority of the money is  
 going to the "Gamma Scanner Appeal."  
 The event is organised by the Crown   
 Hotel.                                
 All the rafts are hand-built out of   
 any materials people can find,the only
 rule being that the rafts are         
 sea-worthy!Some people that take part 
 in the race do so in fancy-dress.     
 When the race has finished the rafts  
 are burned at a big party on Piel     
 Island.
