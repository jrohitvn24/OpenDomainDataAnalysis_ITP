		<content> 11 June, 1985, as experienced by a    
 nine year old.                        
                                       
 Daddy goes to work at 7.10 in a bank  
 at London.  I am still asleep.  Mummy 
 always wakes me up at 7.30.  I get up,
 get dressed and have breakfast.  I    
 have Weetabix and a drink of milk.    
 Then I go upstairs and get washed.  I 
 get my things ready for school.  We   
 get in the car and take Kirsty to her 
 swimming lessons at 8.15.  Mum works  
 at Hassocks Pre-School Playgroup, so  
 she leaves us with her friend who     
 takes us to school.  We go to school  
 at 9.00 and come home at 3.30.  When I
 get home I have a drink of milk and a 
 biscuit.  Then I do my homework and   
 watch television.  I play in my       
 bedroom and help mum with the dinner  
 and set the table.
