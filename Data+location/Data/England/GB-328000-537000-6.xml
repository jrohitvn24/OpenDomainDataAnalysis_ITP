		<content> The area is managed grassland with    
 some open common. The few tracts of   
 woodland are mainly small shelter-    
 belts. Marshland is common in the     
 valley bottoms; heather and whins on  
 the upland moors. There are many      
 footpaths including the north-south   
 Cumbria Way part of which passes      
 through the area from Greenhead to    
 Potts Gill. all paths are well walked 
 and maintained. Pollution is low but  
 people and stock are disturbed by     
 aircraft on low-flying training       
 flights. Rainfall is high and snow    
 must often be cleared from roads in   
 winter before people can get to work  
 or to feed stock.                     
 Resident and breeding animals include 
 badger, bat, fox, hare, field &amp; wood  
 mouse, mink, mole, rabbit, shrew, red 
 squirrel, stoat &amp; weasel. The roe deer
 is a visitor (not breeding in area).  </content>
