		<title>17BUNYAN CHAPEL, PRESTON</title>
		<content> Preston has had a long connection with
 the Baptists. About 1640_1650 Colonel 
 Sadleir,Lord of Temple Dinsley and Sir
 John Read,Lord of the manor of Minsden
 were open and professed Baptists. John
 Bunyan's family were associated with  
 the district long before he began     
 preaching locally. He held meetings in
 Wain Wood,Preston,at dead of night,to 
 avoid discovery. A cottage still      
 stands in the wood where Bunyan is    
 said to have hidden his bible in the  
 inglenook. In 1689,the Toleration Act 
 was passed enabling people to worship 
 as they pleased,  and at the beginning
 of the 18th century,a Baptist meeting 
 place was set up in Preston. During   
 the ministry of John Aldis of Hitchin,
 from 1868_1877,it was decided to build
 a Bunyan Chapel in the village. This  
 chapel is still in use today.
