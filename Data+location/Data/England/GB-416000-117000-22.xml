<content> At school each of the classrooms has a white board at the front which is linked to a laptop computer.  The teachers use them for our lessons to show us what we will be learning.  They are interactive - you can touch the white board to control and change what is on the screen.  &lt;br />We learn how to use computers at school as part of our lessons and learn how to practice our writing and do presentations with photographs and drawings.   Each of the children at school have a password to use a system called Wizkid.  We can use it at home to do our homework or see the projects we have been doing at school.
