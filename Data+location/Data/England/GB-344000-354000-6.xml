		<title>06Our Hopes And Fears</title>
		<content>  I see the jet aeroplanes go overhead 
 and the modern equipment in houses,   
 with videos and microwave ovens       
 becoming more popular.Man is sending  
 astronauts to the moon and becoming   
 very clever,yet in 1985 we have all   
 this unemployment. This causes        
 uncertainty and is a stress factor    
 giving heart problems and other       
 diseases.We worry whether it will all 
 end in a nuclear war. We all hope our 
 sons and daughters will find          
 employment by the time they leave     
 school.We hope to see less violence   
 which builds up because of the pent-up
 energy of youth due to unemployment.  
  The people in jobs get colossal wages
 compared with yesteryear and regard   
 themselves as lucky.Ido not think     
 people work as hard or for such long  
 hours,but I wish they could all find  
 work.                                 </content>
