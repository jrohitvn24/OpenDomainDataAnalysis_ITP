		<content> Woodhall Spa is not close to any      
 important centre of employment and nor
 does the village provide much         
 employment itself.Surveys of the main 
 wage earners in village households    
 show that fewer than one quarter of   
 them work within Woodhall Spa and many
 travel over 20 miles to work.         
 These large distances together with   
 poor public transport mean that most  
 people in the village are car         
 owners.Few people who do not own a car
 could think of living in the village  
 due to its isolation from major       
 facilities and jobs.                  
 Thus the population is largely middle 
 class and wants high quality,expensive
 housing.Woodhall Spa has become one of
 the most expensive villages in        
 Lincolnshire in which to live.Although
 the village is in a farming area few  
 farm workers can afford to live in it.</content>
