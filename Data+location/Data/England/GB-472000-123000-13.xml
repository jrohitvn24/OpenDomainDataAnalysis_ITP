		<title>13CHURCHERS, PETERSFIELD</title>
		<content> Churchers College was founded in l722 
 by Richard Churcher, an East India    
 Company merchant, and was opened in   
 buildings at College Street,          
 Petersfield.  In 1881 it was moved to 
 new buildings on the present site next
 to the A3.  In l95l it became a       
 Voluntary Aided school maintained by  
 Hampshire County Council, but reverted
 to Independent status in l976.  There 
 are about 450 boys at the school, and 
 about a quarter are boarders. Since   
 l980 girls have been admitted to the  
 Sixth form.                           
 The aim of the school is to provide   
 the means by which each boy's         
 qualities are developed to the full,  
 and the activities and discipline of  
 the school are directed towards this.
