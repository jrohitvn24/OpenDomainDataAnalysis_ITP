		<title>15COLD ASHTON'S HOPES OR FEARS</title>
		<content>    In general, people in this area are
 very{happy}with the life they         
 lead.Most of the area is conservation 
 area which prevents further building. 
 There are two{types of people}- the   
 families who have lived in the area   
 for several generations and the new   
 comers. The former have worries       
 concerning their off- spring  being   
 able to find houses in the area at a  
 reasonable price.                     
    There are fears about the future of
 the{Church}in Cold Ashton, which has  
 difficulty in paying its Diocesan     
 Quota. Not only the church goers want 
 to keep the church, nearly all the    
 residents want to see it maintained   
 and used.Some fear the entrance from  
 the{A46}will be lost. This is the only
 usable access to the village in bad   
 weather.All hope the countryside will 
 remain as unchanged as possible.      </content>
