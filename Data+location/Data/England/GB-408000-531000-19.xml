		<title>19NON-CONFORMIST CHURCHES</title>
		<content>  There are 2 non-conformist churches  
 in the village.The Baptist Church,    
 founded in 1663 and rebuilt in 1774 is
 a listed building.The Church meets    
 only once a month,as, of the 8 members
 only 2 live in the village.The others 
 have moved to a nearby town but still 
 attend the services regularly.A lay   
 preacher oversees the running of the  
 church affairs.Land and the Manse     
 owned by the church are rented out.   
  The Methodist Church,built in 1887   
 has a weekly service,attended by 8-12 
 mainly village residents.It runs the  
 only Sunday School in the village     
 which has 17 regular scholars.The     
 church is cared for by a circuit      
 minister,and is one of a group of 6,  
 all of which contribute to a central  
 fund.Occasionally these churches get  
 together to share a service.At other  
 times local preachers officiate.      </content>
