<title>13Tanfield Village</title>
<content>

Tanfield Village is a small settlement of just over 100 houses, there are two major estates St Margret's Drive and Tudor Drive with a smaller estate called The Hayricks. There are also numerous rows of houses Hawthorne Terrace and Maude Terrace. There are two Public Houses The Peacock and The Pack Horse Inn. There is no longer a Village shop. The Church, St Margret's,  is a very prominent feature of the Village with two grave yards one situated directly across the road. There is a church hall where both summer and winter fairs are held. Another prominent feature of the Village is Tanfield Hall, which was narrowly missed by a bomb on either Sunday, 11th/Monday, 12th May 1941 which caused minor damage to the windows and doors of the hall.   &lt;br />
