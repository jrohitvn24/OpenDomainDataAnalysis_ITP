old and houses one engine which is nine
years old. It is a part time station,  
the officers having other jobs which   
they can be called from. There is a 50'
practice tower. The engine carries 20  
hoses, most of which are 75'long, and 3
ladders of which the longest is 10.5ms.
The engine carries about 400 gallons of
water and has a maximum speed of 70mph 
though 40mph is considered a safe speed
on the way to a fire.It has 6 equipment
compartments and can carry 8 firemen   
though 6 is the normal number. The     
station receives about 200 calls a year
most of which are local incidents, but 
the engine can be called out to fires  
over a wider area. Equipment is        
standard throughout the country. The   
helmets are made of cork and plastic.
