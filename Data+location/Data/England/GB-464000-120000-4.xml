		<title>04PIG FARMING AT WHITEWOOL FM.</title>
		<content> We are engaged in an "intensive"      
 system where the animals are housed   
 for the whole of their life.Sows are  
 housed in a large building with       
 moderate temperature and served by    
 boars housed seperately in the same   
 house.Farrowing takes place in another
 building consisting of several        
 rooms,each containing 12 crates.Births
 can be synchronised by the use of     
 drugs and we aim for more than 10 pigs
 per litter.Weaning is at 17 days when 
 the piglets are transferred into a    
 smaller house which has a very        
 accurate controlled environment.After 
 four weeks they are moved into further
 accomodation and are feed on a liquid 
 diet until sale at 80 kilos live      
 weight.
