 This is part of an area of outstanding
 natural beauty unspoilt by commercial 
 activities. Agriculture and Tourism   
 are the major activities of this area.
 The major land use is for grazing and 
 crops for the dairy industry and  very
 little grown for human consumption.   
 Housing is concentrated in one village
 which houses 1000 people the majority 
 of whom live on 3 Council estates.    
 There is scattered housing on the 16  
 farms and hamlets in the area. Much of
 the housing is used during the Summer 
 months to accommodate tourists in bed 
 and breakfast.  There are 3 centres   
 for self-catering accommodation but no
 caravan or tent parks.
