		<title>12TEDSTILL COTTAGES</title>
		<content>    {Tedstill cottages}are three       
 kilometres south of Bridgnorth in the 
 countryside.They were built in{1805.  
                                       
   There used to be four houses but now
 there are only three.Both ends of the 
 cottages have been modernized.The back
 of the homes used to each have a wash 
 house, and each house also had its own
{pigsty.}There used to be a{well}in the
 back yard which supplied them with    
 water.For a{bath,}they used a tin bath
 in front of the fire.                 
                                       
    At number three in the sitting room
 there used to be a pantry, and in the 
 pantry was a salting slab where they  
 salted the pigs to store the meat.
