		<content> The spiritual needs of the residents  
 are mostly met by 4 denominations,    
 Church of England, Catholic, Methodist
 and Pentecostal. The Parish Church St.
 Margarets is the oldest denomination. 
 Its building is used by Church of     
 England members and Roman Catholic    
 worshippers. A special dispensation   
 was given by the Bishop of Southwell  
 so that the Catholics could hold a    
 weekly service. The Methodist Chapel  
 in Valley Road is used for Sunday     
 Morning worship and Sunday School plus
 evening prayer. It has a midweek Youth
 Club for 2 age groups and a Mums and  
 Toddlers Fellowship. The Pentecostal  
 Church is the newest group, run under 
 the auspices of the Assemblies of God.
 They meet in a wooden hall in         
 Mickledale Lane, which belonged to St.
 Margaret. Their congregation is small 
 but growing.                          </content>
