		<content> A LITTLE WAY OUT OF WEST TANFIELD,    
 NEAR LOWSIDES FARM, IS A FISH         
 HATCHERY.  THE FISH ARE REARED FROM   
 EGGS AND THE YOUNG TROUT ARE PUT INTO 
 THE RIVER URE, TO PROVIDE SPORT FOR   
 THE ANGLING CLUB MEMBERS.  THE FEE TO 
 JOIN THE CLUB IS Â£250 FOR NEW MEMBERS 
 PLUS Â£250 EACH YEAR.                  
 MR STURDY, THE WATER BAILIFF, SHOWED  
 US THE PONDS IN WHICH THE YOUNG TROUT 
 ARE REARED.  THE RAINBOW TROUT ARE    
 BROUGHT FROM CALIFORNIA AND THE BROWN 
 TROUT COME FROM MALTON IN THE VALE OF 
 PICKERING.  THE EGGS, ABOUT 15,000 ARE
 PUT IN THE PONDS IN EARLY SPRING.     
 ABOUT 70% OF THE EGGS DIE EACH YEAR.  
 TO PROTECT THE YOUNG FISH FROM        
 DIPPERS, KINGFISHERS AND WATER VOLES, 
 MR STURDY HAS A WIRE NET ABOVE EACH   
 POND.  SPRING WATER IS CONTINUALLY    
 RUNNING THROUGH THE PONDS.
