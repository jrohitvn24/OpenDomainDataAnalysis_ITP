		<title>14CHILDRENS' GAMES</title>
		<content> THE GAME IS CALLED{MURDERBALL.}IT     
 CONSISTS OF ONLY ONE RULE. IT CAN GET 
 ROUGH AT TIMES.THE OBJECT OF THE GAME 
 IS TO TOUCH A BALL DOWN IN THE MIDDLE 
 OF 2 POSTS BUT TO DO THAT YOU HAVE TO 
 FIGHT YOUR WAY THROUGH ABOUT 10       
 PEOPLE.                               
 THE 2 POSTS ARE AT THE OPPOSITE END OF
 THE COURT FROM YOUR TEAM.YOU ARE      
 ALLOWED TO GO BEHIND BOTH GOALS BUT   
 YOU CAN'T SCORE FROM BEHIND THE       
 GOAL.THERE IS A LOT OF VIOLENCE AND A 
 FEW PEOPLE GET{HURT!}THE STRONGEST    
 SIDE ALWAYS WINS.WE REALLY TOOK THE   
 IDEA FROM RUGBY.YOU CAN HIT OR KICK   
 ANYONE ANYWHERE IN THE BODY BUT IF YOU
 DO IT TOO MUCH YOU GET SENT OFF FOR   
 TWO MINUTES.SOMETIMES PEOPLE GET      
 BRUISED AND ARE ALLOWED A REST OF     
 ABOUT THREE MINUTES.
