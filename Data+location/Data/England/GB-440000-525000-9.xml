		<content> THE NORTH EASTERN RAILWAY LINE WAS    
 OPENED IN 1880. IT JOINED UP          
 BOWESFIELD JUNCTION, STOCKTON, THORPE 
 THEWELS, WYNWARD AND HURWURTH BURN    
 WITH WELLFIELD, SUNDERLAND, CASTLE    
 EDEN AND HART.                        
      PASSENGERS BECAME NON-EXISTANT ON
 THIS LINE IN 1931 AND THE SAME        
 HAPPENED TO THE GOODS IN 1951 AND     
 EVENTUALLY THE FINAL STOPPAGE WAS MADE
 TO MINERALS IN 1966.                  
      CLEVELAND COUNTY COUNCIL TOOK    
 OVER FROM THE NORTH EASTERN RAILWAY   
 COMPANY.                              
      IN 1979 AND THE RAILWAY'S        
 VIADUCT WAS KNOCKED DOWN AND THE TRACK
 PULLED UP. IT WAS THEN TRANSFORMED    
 INTO A NATURE TRAIL.                  
      OVER 60,000 PEOPLE VISITED THE   
 WALKWAY IN 1983 AND EVEN MORE IN 1984.
 THE WALKWAY FOLLOWS THE EXACT TRACK OF
 THE CASTLE EDEN RAILWAY FOR 3\ MILES. </content>
