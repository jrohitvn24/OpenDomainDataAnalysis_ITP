		<title>19HOUSING IN CLACTON</title>
		<content> There are a wide variety of types of  
 housing in Clacton-on-Sea. As with    
 most towns, there are a number of     
 council-owned houses and bungalows,   
 which appear in groups together.      
 Most houses in Clacton are            
 owner-occupied, however, although the 
 range of architectural style is vast. 
 Certain areas of the town are better  
 sought after areas, and thus house    
 prices can easily exceed Â£100,000.    
 However, in much of Clacton an average
 three bedroomed house could be found  
 for between Â£30,000 and Â£40,000. Many 
 developments of new houses have been  
 built by major contractors such as    
 Wimpey, and there are a growing number
 of small 'starter homes' being built. 
 Because of the large number of elderly
 residents in Clacton, there are a     
 large number of bungalows in the area.
