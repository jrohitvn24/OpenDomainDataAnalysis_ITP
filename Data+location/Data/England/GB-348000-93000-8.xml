		<title>08LODERS PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Loders School is a small primary      
 school in nice village. The school    
 owns a playground and its neighbours  
 lend us a field in which we hold our  
 May Fair and Sports Day. The field    
 contains a games shed, two storage    
 sheds, a sandpit and a climbing frame.
 Hopefully it will hold more soon.     
 The school itself has three classrooms
 one for infants, one for 1st and 2nd  
 years and one for the 3rd and 4th     
 years. It also has a cloakroom and an 
 office.                               
 The staff is made up of three         
 teachers, one part-time teacher, one  
 welfare assistant and a secretary. All
 of them are very nice.                
 The school's average population is    
 around 70.For transport a mini bus is 
 supplied for children who are not in  
 walking distance and have no other    
 means of transport.                   </content>
