		<content> Employment has changrd very much in   
 the villages in the last 50 years.Most
 people in the village used to work on 
 local farms or at home,but now most   
 people have to go to nearby towns for 
 employment.There are still some       
 farmers and farm workers but only     
 about 3 or 4 people are needed to run 
 a farm as the machines now do most of 
 the jobs that were done by men and    
 boys.Women and girls now go to work in
 offices and factories.Most of the men 
 in the villages who go to the town are
 professionals or skilled workers.The  
 others work at nearby cheese factories
 where Stilton cheese is made or       
 dairies.The women used to work for    
 rich households but now they too work 
 in the local factories or offices,or  
 are professional people.Most people   
 travel to work by their own car or one
 belonging to their company.           </content>
