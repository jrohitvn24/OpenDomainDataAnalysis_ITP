		<title>11LOADS OF RUBBISH COVENTRY SW</title>
		<content> Rubbish is an important problem in a  
 large city like Coventry in 1985.     
 65,000 tons of household rubbish alone
 is collected every year by a fleet of 
 refuse lorries &amp; teams of refuse      
 collectors.Much of it is buried in    
{land fill sites}which are then covered
 with soil and grassed over to make    
 attractive parkland.                  
 On the London Rd.we have an enormous  
{incinerator plant}which burns vast    
 quantities of rubbish.The heat from   
 the furnace is sold to a nearby       
 factory.                              
 We now have a{bottle bank}at Whitley  
 waste disposal site.Instead of        
 throwing away our used bottles we can 
 put them into a specially designed    
 skip.The glass is sold and recycled.  
 A{can bank}is a possibility in the    
 future.
