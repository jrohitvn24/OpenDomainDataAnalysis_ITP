		<title>19Coleshill: A Village Study.</title>
		<content> Coleshill has a church,which was built
 in 1450.There is an average of 2      
 Weddings, 4 Christenings and 2        
 Funerals each year.The church altar   
 and most houses are owned by the      
 National Trust.Some years ago a famous
 potter died and left Â£7000 to the     
 church.They give it to all school     
 leavers.There aren't many             
 children,because there are no         
 jobs.There's a post office, a         
 general store and a nursery with      
 about 30 children.There is 1          
 pub called Radnor Arms,named after    
 Lord Radnor,who lived in Coleshill    
 House which was burnt down in 1952.The
 grounds are now used as nursery       
 gardens.There is a war memorial in    
 memory of those who died in the 1st   
 and 2nd World War.Also there is 1 bus 
 stop.
