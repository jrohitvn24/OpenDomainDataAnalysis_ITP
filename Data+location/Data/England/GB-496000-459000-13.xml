		<title>13The East Riding Dialect</title>
		<content> Some of the oldest inhabitants of     
 Garton,particularly farm-workers,     
 still naturally speak a dialect.      
 Younger villagers can understand it   
 but the children have very little     
 knowledge of it.                      
 As one might expect farm folk have had
 very little 'bewk-larnin' over the    
 centuries.This has resulted in a      
 language which has changed very little
 in the last 4 or 5 hundred years and  
 has much in common with the English of
 a 1000 years ago.At that time the East
 Riding was heavily invaded by Norsemen
 particularly from Denmark.An analysis 
 of the dialect shows few French or    
 Latin words but many Danish.          
 We interviewed 82 year old Mr W with a
 tape recorder.We found that he        
 naturally spoke a dialect and knew and
 used words  spoken by the Norsemen of 
 a 1000 years ago.                     </content>
