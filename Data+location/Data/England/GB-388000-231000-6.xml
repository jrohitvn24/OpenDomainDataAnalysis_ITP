		<content>  The town mayor's duties consist of   
 presiding over council meetings and   
 representing the town on such         
 occasions as the carnival and the     
 festival.The mayor does not have a    
 chauffeur driven car,but usually does 
 not travel far as his duties are      
 generally confined to the town or     
 local area.                           
  The mayor does not receive an annual 
 salary,but as help,the mayor has the  
 aid of a deputy mayor and a mayoress. 
  There has been a mayor in Tewkesbury 
 since 1836,when a new charter by      
 William III succeeded one by James II.
