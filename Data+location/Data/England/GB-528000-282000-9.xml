 big,well built and they thought the   
 appearance of each house own different
 character.They liked the area because 
 it was handily placed inbetween       
 Peterbourgh and Huntingdon.They moved 
 because of,a change of job.When they  
 buy another house they will buy a new 
 house.They think a new house is better
 than an older one because you don't   
 have to do any repairs.
