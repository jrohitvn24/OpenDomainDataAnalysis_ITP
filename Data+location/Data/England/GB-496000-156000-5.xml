		<title>05CLIFF HATCH STABLES, WOKING</title>
		<content>      Cliff Hatch Stables is situated  
 in Saunders Lane in Mayford.They own  
 about sixteen acres but they lease    
 about fourteen acres.The horses are   
 fed on cubes, their old diet consisted
 of sugar-beet, oats, chaff and barley.
 They have field and stable liveries.  
 The horses are shod every five weeks. 
 The weekends are the bussiest times at
 the stables.                          
      They own about thirty horses,    
 The favourites are a mare called      
 'Ferhanoush' and a stallion called    
 'Arabian Gold'. The only time the     
 horses play up is when it is windy.   
 The owner, is hoping for              
 an indoor riding school but she needs 
 planning permission.                  
      The stables have recently been   
 replaced and are in very good         
 condition.                            
                                       </content>
