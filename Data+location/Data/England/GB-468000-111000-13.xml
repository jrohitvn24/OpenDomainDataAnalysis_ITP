		<title>13JOBS IN HORNDEAN AND WECOCK</title>
		<content> A local man founded a road haulage    
 company in 1964. It was a family firm 
 which moved from Shoreham. He owned   
 and directed it for 17 yrs, until 1981
 when he retired. At one time there    
 were other depots in England.The best 
 customer was the Guernsey Tomato      
 Board. He also had other contracts    
 with ITS Rubber and Havant Joinery.At 
 one time the company had 30 vehicles. 
 The company is now being bought out by
 a Plant Hire firm. Business has       
 declined due to loss of the tomato    
 trade and competition from small      
 operators with few overheads. Locally 
 some small businesses are disappearing
 but others needing fewer workers are  
 gradually taking their place. A survey
 of 134 people in the Wecock area      
 showed 46 were unemployed and that    
 painting and decorating were popular  
 self employments.                     </content>
