		<title>20A walk up Haltwhistle Burn</title>
		<content>   The footpath follows the track of a 
 railway line on which a small "tankie"
 steam engine used to pull loads of    
 whinstone from Cawfields Quarry.  In  
 the past the narrow valley formed by  
 the Haltwhistle Burn was the centre of
 local industry and reminders of this  
 are all around.  Stone walls show     
 where a woollen mill once made good   
 use of a ready supply of wool.  Spoil 
 heaps and a chimney mark the spot     
 where fireclay goods were once        
 made.A lime kiln can be seen where    
 farmers used coal to burn limestone to
 spread on sour land to help the grass 
 grow.  Entrances to a drift mine can  
 be seen, and the chimney and platforms
 for the winding gear.  The energetic  
 can count the 125 steps of the        
 Catstairs while the rest of the party 
 enjoy watching dippers feeding in the 
 Burn.                                 </content>
