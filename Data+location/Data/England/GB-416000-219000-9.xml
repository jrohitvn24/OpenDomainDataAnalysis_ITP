		<title>09Soil content around Bourton</title>
		<content> Most of the land in the valleys of the
{River Windrush}and its tributary, the 
{Dikler,}is down to{pasture.}In the    
 east the{land rises steeply}from{140  
{to 240 metres}with a{spring line      
 occurring at{210 metres.              
{Soil samples}taken and analysed from  
 twelve sites over the area, six to the
 west of the Dikler and six to the     
 east, show a{considerable variation}in
{humus}and{moisture content.           
 To the west of the river the{moisture 
{content}varied from 7.07% to 16.41%   
 and in the east between 8.82% and     
 11.67%. The dampest soils were found  
 near Moore Lane Farm, north-east of   
 Bourton.                              
{Humus content}varied between 5.32% on 
 the wettest soils and 31.83% south-   
 east of Wyck Rissington.
