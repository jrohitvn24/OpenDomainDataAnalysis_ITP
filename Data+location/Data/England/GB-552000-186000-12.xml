		<title>12HORNCHURCH SWIMMING POOL</title>
		<content>      Hornchurch Swimming Pool is just 
 at the edge of Harrow Lodge Park.   It
 was built in 1956.   It was the first 
 swimming pool to be built in Britain  
 after the Second World War.  This was 
 because all building materials were   
 being used to replace bomb-damaged    
 property.   It was built to a new     
 design with the changing rooms away   
 from the poolside and a spectator     
 gallery along one side. This design is
 still used for most swimming pools    
 today.                                
      An additional pool was built     
 alongside the main pool in 1981 for   
 learners and disabled swimmers with   
 toilet and special changing           
 facilities.                           
      It is interesting that more      
 people have swimming lessons at       
 Hornchurch Swimming  Pool than at any 
 other pool in Britain.                </content>
