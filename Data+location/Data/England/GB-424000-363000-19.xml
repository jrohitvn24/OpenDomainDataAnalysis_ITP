		<content>   The Surgery,situated at the bottom  
 of Whitworth road in Darley Dale,was  
 converted from an old house.The       
 surgery being moved because of its    
 small size.In the surgery there are   
 five people including Dr.Martys.This  
 group of people consists of three     
 doctors and two secretarys.Dr.Martys  
 ,who was the doctor we interviewed,has
 now been working there for fifteen    
 years.He finds it a hard working      
 job,starting at eight a.m. and        
 finishing at six p.m..He mainly treats
 elderly people, who suffer,mostly,from
 rumatism and diebetes."The patients   
 themselves can prevent these by more  
 exercise,eating less fatty foods and  
 having less sugar in their meals,"He  
 says. Some diseases are spread by     
 human contact so cleanliness in the   
 area is all important.
