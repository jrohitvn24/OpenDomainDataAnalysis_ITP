		<content>The Saxons built a Church out of wood  
on the site of the present Church in   
about 700 A.D. for followers of the    
Christian religion. The wooden church  
was destroyed and a stone church was   
built in about 977 A.D.. The Normans   
built the present church on the same   
site in the 12th century. In 1716 the  
Lady Chapel became the Dashwood family 
chapel. The Lady Chapel was built in   
the 13th century. There is a wall      
painting of St.George and the Dragon   
which was painted in the 15th century. 
There is an 18th century sundial on    
the south side of the church. The      
church can hold 250 people if they are 
sitting down. Rev D. Wilcox is the     
Rector of the United Benefice of       
Kirtlington, Bletchington,             
Weston-on-the-Green and Hampton Gay.
