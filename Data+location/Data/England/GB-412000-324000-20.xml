		<title>20The Community of Newborough</title>
		<content>  The majority of people living here   
 were not born in the area; they live  
 with parents or came here to work or  
 to retire. Farming and timber felling 
 are obvious occupations but there is a
 wide spectrum of other professions.   
  Almost everyone living in this area  
 enjoys being here; they like the peace
 and quiet of the pleasant village, the
 unspoilt countryside and the decent,  
 interesting people of the small,      
 friendly community where almost every-
 one knows everyone else.              
  There are however some disadvantages:
 Some would like more public transport,
 more sports facilities &amp; entertainment
 for the younger end. There are too few
 small, cheap houses and too much heavy
 and fast traffic through the narrow   
 lanes.It would also be pleasant to    
 have our own resident policeman and   
 dispensing chemist.                   </content>
