		<title>05Farming in St. Levan (1)</title>
		<content> Farming in St. Levan is undergoing a  
{continual change}and modernization as 
 in other parts of the country. Once   
{almost exclusively dairy-farming,}with
 some cashcrops as a sideline, it is   
{now diversifying into other areas.    
 Reduction of manpower leads to more   
 mechanization; contract machinery hire
 is now a feature of some cashcrops,   
 once almost unknown except for cereal 
 crops harvested for use as cattle     
 food.{Landowners are amalgamating     
{small farms into bigger,}more economic
{units as tenants vacate them.}Owners  
 buy up adjacent smaller farms and also
 amalgamate. This has{lead to reducing 
{the number of families living in the  
{traditional life style of the parish. 
 Only nine separate farm units operate 
 within the block area; Raftra/Sawah,  
 Bosistow/Rospletha, Roskestal/Higher  
 Bosistow being all combined.(Cont p.6)</content>
