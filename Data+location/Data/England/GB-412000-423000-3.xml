		<title>03MR FIELDHOUSE'S VISIT</title>
		<content>{                                      
 Mr Fieldhouse is 72, has lived in Hove
 Edge all his life, and went to our    
 school. He came to St Chad's to talk  
 about the history of the district.    
 The school was built in 1894, and was 
 used as a church as well, until St    
 Chad's Church was built in 1912.      
 When he was a boy, there were very few
 houses. In those days most local      
 people worked in the quarries. Whilst 
 in school, all day long he could hear 
 the noise from them, and of the trams 
 which ran along Upper Green Lane.     
 Once, Mr Fieldhouse was caned for     
 climbing onto the school roof to      
 retrieve a football. Children were    
 often caned in those days.            
 Gradually, over the years, the        
 district became more residential and  
 more and more, people went to work out
 of the district.                      </content>
