 FRIENDLY ATMOSPHERE. YOU CAN HAVE A   
 LESSON IN THE INDOOR OR OUTDOOR

    THEY HAVE APPROXIMATELY TWENTY     
 PONIES AND HORSES, AND ABOUT FIVE     
 QUALIFIED INSTRUCTORS WITH LOTS OF    
 HELPERS.                              
                                       
    RIDES ARE OVER THE MENDIP HILLS,   
 THROUGH THE WOODS AND FIELDS,OR ON    
 ROADS OR TRACKS. IF YOU  ARE NEW TO   
 RIDING THERE ARE LOTS OF SMALL PONIES
