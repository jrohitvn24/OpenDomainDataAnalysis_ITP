 The 14th Century church of All Saints 
 stands on a tree and flower covered   
 hill on the site chosen by God (see   
 Supernatural - Godshill). The Island's
 largest Medieval church, it has twin  
 naves, chancels and transepts and a   
 fortified square tower. The S.transept
 chapel has a 15th Century mural of    
 Christ crucified on a 3-branched lily 
 cross, unique in England. Once the    
 monastic church of Appuldurcombe,     
 ancestral home of the Worsleys, it is 
 rich with Worsley monuments; Sir James
 and Lady Anne kneel in the E.chancel; 
 Sir Richard is commemorated by a 30   
 ton sarcophagus; Sir John and Lady    
 Agnes Leigh,parents of Lady Anne, lie 
 under a stone canopy, his feet resting
 on a pig, their soles carved with "The
 Weepers", counting their rosary beads.
