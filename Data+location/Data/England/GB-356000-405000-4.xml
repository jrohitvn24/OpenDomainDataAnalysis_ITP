		<content>  Approximately 400 metres along the   
 Canal Bank is the{Trencherfield Cotton
{Mill}built in 1908. This was a cotton-
 spinning mill, one of several in the  
 Wigan area. The main feature of the   
 mill is the{steam engine}that powered 
 all the machinery within the mill.    
  The mill engine was built in Bolton  
 by J &amp; E Wood Ltd., and it gives 2100 
 horse power. The boiler operates at a 
 pressure of 200 pounds per square inch
 and the huge 25 foot diameter flywheel
 rotates at 65 revolutions per minute. 
  The Metropolitan Borough of Wigan    
 have spent a lot of money on the      
 renovation of the Trencherfield Mill  
 site. They have refurbished the mill  
 engine room and restored the engine so
 that it is now the only working engine
 of its kind in England as well as     
 being the largest working mill steam  
 engine in the world.                  </content>
