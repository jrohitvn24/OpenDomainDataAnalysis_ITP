		<content> Donna an 11 year old writes about The 
 Rec. We did a project on our Rec.     
 because there was no good equipment.We
 visited the Rec. measured it drew     
 plans, took photo's and wrote about   
 it.We invited Parish Councillors to   
 talk to us about money that could be  
 spent on equipment.We also found out  
 that there was some extra space, but  
 that was  to be used to extend the car
 park.We did surveys with children to  
 find out which equipment was most     
 popular.We made a book of our work and
 entered it for a competition run by   
 The Daily Mirror.                     
 We had an exhibition of our work and  
 invited Parish Councillors, parents,  
 children and representatives from     
 local newspapers.They took photo's    
 and printed a piece the following     
 week.They said that before adults buy 
 equipment they should "Ask The Kids." </content>
