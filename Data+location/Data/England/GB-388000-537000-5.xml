		<title>05ST.JOHNS CHAPEL MART (2)</title>
		<content>    There were lots of farmers outside 
 looking at the animals in the pens.   
 Most of them were Charolais cows. Some
 of the local farmers had walked their 
 cattle to the mart and we saw some    
 going past school at playtime.        
    Inside it was noisy, smoky and     
 quite dark. Lots of the farmers were  
 sitting on the wooden benches that are
 around three sides of the ring. Some  
 were standing around the rail on the  
 outside of the ring. They wore caps,  
 waterproof-jackets and wellingtons,   
 some carried sticks.                  
    The cows were moved around the ring
 by a man using a stick. The floor was 
 covered in sawdust.                   
    Mr Peart was the auctioneer and he 
 was talking very fast. He had a       
 microphone fixed to his shirt so that 
 people could hear his voice more      
 clearly.                              </content>
