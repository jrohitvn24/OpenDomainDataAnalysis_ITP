   or Middleton-in-Teesdale, passing   
 through Winston.  Royalty visiting    
 nearby Raby Castle would alight there 
 .  Cattle and farm produce were       
 despatched from Winston.  It was once 
 a very busy little station.           
 In 1964 when the railway was closed,  
 the stationmaster's son bought it and 
 established a very successful haulage 
 business.                             
 The booking office and waiting rooms  
 are now used as offices.  The engine  
 house remains, but on the track beside
 it there is a concrete ramp for the   
 inspection of lorries.   Large work   
 sheds and storage sheds have been     
 built and alongside the small railway 
 cottages there is a big modern house.
