 largely during the 1960's of which the
 former consists of terraced and semi- 
  detached properties and the latter of
 semis and detached houses.The S.E.area
 of Stivichall contains semis, terraced
 and flat dwellings, some council owned
 together with old peoples'            
 bungalows.The S.W. area of Willenhall 
 is basically of maisonette and        
 terraced homes privately owned and    
 with a substantial retired
