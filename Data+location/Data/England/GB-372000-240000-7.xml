		<title>07Colwall 50 Years Ago &amp; Today</title>
		<content>  In the thirties Colwall was a tightly
 knit, insular rural community with its
 interests and activities agiculturally
 based. An almost self-supporting place
 the shops were good, services  and    
 repairs of all kinds were immediately 
 available. In 1985 the pattern is     
 quite different. Apart from becoming a
 dormitory for Worcester and Malvern   
 there has been a great influx of      
 'outsiders' who have settled here for 
 their retirement. Two major changes   
 occured,both concern traffic. The busy
 double-tracked railway line has been  
 replaced with a single one carrying   
 little freight and few passengers. The
 pretty station with its colourful     
 flower beds is now a drab halt with a 
 tiny tin hut. Road transport has grown
 alarmingly. Through traffic is noisier
 and much faster while parked vehicles 
 have transformed the peaceful village.</content>
