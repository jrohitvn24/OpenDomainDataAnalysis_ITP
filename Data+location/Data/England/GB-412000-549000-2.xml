		<content> We went to Security Laminator Ltd, on 
 the Leagate Industrial estate. We     
 went in and they were unloadiing      
 glass. These were carried by overhead 
 cranes, they lifted the glass with    
 suckers. The glass is measured to     
 size.                                 
 The glass was put in a big washing    
 machiine. It went on through a room   
 where they put a sheet of glass and   
 then                                  
 plastic a few times. Then they put it 
 into a large electriic oven. After    
 that they put it into a pressure      
 chamber.Now t is bullet proof. They   
 test it with various guns.
