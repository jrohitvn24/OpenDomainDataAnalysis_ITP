		<content>We have stables to put the horses in in
winter. Our stables are made out of    
wood, we put straw in them for the     
horses to lie on.Horses have metal     
shoes nailed to their feet. The        
blacksmith puts on the horse's shoes.  
When we take our horses to shows we    
always make them look nice.We put some 
dark oil on their hooves to make them  
shine.                                 
 Every month we go to the vets and get 
a kind of medicine called Wormer. This 
is a medicine that comes in a long tube
You put the tube in the horses mouth   
and press the bottom, you have to hold 
the horses chin and hold their head up 
to get them to swallow the medicine.   
 Worms are long red things that horses 
get if they eat too much grass. When   
you give them the medicine the worms   
come out in their droppings.
