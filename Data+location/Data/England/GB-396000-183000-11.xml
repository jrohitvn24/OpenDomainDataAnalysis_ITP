		<title>11TRANSPORT, SOMERFORD AREA</title>
		<content>   Because this is a rural area,several
 miles from the nearest towns,transport
 is very important.In the late 19th    
 century a branch line of the Great    
 Western Railway was extended to Great 
 Somerford,and in this century to      
 Little Somerford,providing what Portia
 Hobbs,a local historian,has described 
 as "the best public transport this    
 village has ever had".Sadly,because it
 did not pay the line was closed and   
 those who do not own cars now depend  
 on the local bus services.            
   At present there is a bus service to
 Swindon 5 times a day,and one to      
 Malmesbury which runs 6 times a day.A 
 mini-bus also provides a service to   
 Chippenham.                           
   Since the 2 Somerford schools were  
 replaced by our school,many children  
 have to come by bus.This coming year  
 they will have to pay 25p a day.      </content>
