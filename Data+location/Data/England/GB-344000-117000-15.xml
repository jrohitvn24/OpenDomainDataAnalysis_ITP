		<title>15Poultry Farm, Martock</title>
		<content>     This chicken farm owned by        
 Hebditch is one of the largest in the 
 country.  It has over 40,000 chicks of
 which half of them (the males) get    
 gassed, processed, then fed to other  
 animals at zoos.  The males are the   
 darker coloured birds.  The males are 
 thrown into a bin.  The  ones at the  
 bottom suffercate and die before they 
 are gassed. Bad eggs are thrown into  
 another bin and some explode leaving a
 nasty smell. The female chicks are    
 sold all over the country to farmers  
 for egg laying.  The chicks although  
 good egg producers do not put on      
 enough weight for them to be sold for 
 the table. This is why it is not      
 economical for them to keep the males.
 They have 8 incubators and they stay  
 in these for about 25 days.  The farm 
 also own some land which is used to   
 grow crops, mainly barley and wheat.  </content>
