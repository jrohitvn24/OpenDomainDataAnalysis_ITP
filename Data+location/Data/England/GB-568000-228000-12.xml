		<title>12BEE-KEEPING</title>
		<content>  Near Bluegate Hall is Mr. Ridgewell's
 apiary, which is situated in a small  
 copse which is reached by a field     
 track. There are 6 hives containing an
 average of 7O,OOO bees and 4 smaller  
 hives which house 4O,OOO bees which   
 are used for rearing queens. The bees 
 are from an Italian stock and came    
 originally from Northern Italy. These 
 bees are calmer and more productive   
 than the native black bee. The honey  
 that Mr. Ridgewell collects each year 
 from his hives is usually from rape,  
 field bean and wild rose. The queens  
 are reared by grafting queen bee cells
 and removing the original queen from  
 the hive. This encourages the workers 
 to feed the new queen bee cells on the
 necessary food, royal jelly. The queen
 bees are sold with 12 workers to start
 new colonies for other bee keepers.
