		<title>06EMPLOYMENT AND LEISURE</title>
		<content> In the Collingham area about 70 %of   
 the adult population work full time or
 part time.Nearly 20% of the people    
 were retired whilst 10 % were         
 unemployed.                           
 This figure is slightly below the     
 national figure for 1985.             
 In their spare time 30% of the people 
 watched T.V regulary.This figure seems
 to be rather low and was based on a   
 small sample.Sport was an important   
 leisure pursuit with half the         
 population participating in their     
 spare time. The village attracted     
 people as residents because it has a  
 pleasent environment surrounded by    
 countryside.The most consistent       
 dislike in the village was the busy   
 A58.It is a not particulary religious 
 village as only 30% attend church.    
 The small sample were unanimous in    
 liking the village.                   </content>
