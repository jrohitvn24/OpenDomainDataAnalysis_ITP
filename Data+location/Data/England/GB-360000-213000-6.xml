		<content> Technological Equipment at Home.A     
 class of infants and first and second 
 year juniors decided to find out what 
 pieces of technological equipment they
 had in their homes.The results were as
 follows:telephones 11,televisions 24, 
 videos 8,computers 2,recordplayers 24.
 The survey shows that over half the   
 children in the class have tetephones 
 in their homes.Each home has a        
 television and a record player.Some   
 homes have more than one of these     
 probably having an extra set in the   
 child's bedroom!Eight families have   
 video recorders at home.Video films   
 can be hired from the nearby          
 towns.Only two households have        
 computers.However considering the low 
 socio_economic area this is perhaps   
 not so surprising.
