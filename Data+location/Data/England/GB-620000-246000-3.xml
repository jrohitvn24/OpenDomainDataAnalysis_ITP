		<content> The majority of the families have     
 telephones, possibly those who have   
 not are those in greatest need of them
 but find the charges expensive.  Five 
 telephone boxes are in the area and   
 local people have backed the Women's  
 Institute7s countrywide camp@aign to  
 keep an adequate number of boxes on   
 the roadsides.  A new technique, fibre
 optic cable, is laid underground lon  
 the small section of A12 road 23/46.  
 This feeds into Kesgrave telephone    
 exchange.  There is an adequate number
 of pillar-boxes for letters.  Two     
 collections and two deliveries of     
 letter post are made daily, except on 
 Saturday - one of each.  parcel post  
 has one delivery on six days but there
 are no postal services at all on      
 Sunday.
