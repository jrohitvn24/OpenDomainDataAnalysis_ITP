		<content>{                                      
{  }This block covers a completely     
 rural area of the S. Downs of great   
 interest to botanists &amp; conservation- 
 ists. The N. face of the Downs is     
 covered with rough grass, scrub and   
 mainly deciduous trees, while the S.  
 facing slopes are thickly planted with
 a mixture of conifers and deciduous   
 trees forming the Charlton &amp; Singleton
 forests, criss-crossed by many grassy 
 footpaths and bridle ways.            
{  }Along the top of the Downs the S.  
 Downs Way runs through a wide stretch 
 of flatter land, formerly covered with
 short downland turf but now mostly    
 ploughed &amp; planted with cereal crops. 
{  }Chalk flowers, including many now  
 rare, still grow on the northern      
 slopes.  Many species of butterflies }
 &amp; insects flourish &amp; birds &amp; animals  
 enjoy the quiet habitat.              </content>
