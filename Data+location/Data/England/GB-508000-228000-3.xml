		<title>03Farming Machinery</title>
		<content> Mortgrove and Barton Hill are farmed  
 by brothers. They share all their     
 machinery including{14 tractors.}They 
 have{3 cultivators}for loosening the  
 soil ready for ploughing and one huge 
 machine for spraying oil seed rape.   
 The cab is high in the air. To get in 
 you tread on the gigantic wheel and   
 then jump up. Beneath the cab and     
 between the wheels is a six foot high 
 space so that the machine can pass    
 over the rape which grows as high as  
 the farmer. Farmers have constant     
 trouble with{weeds}in their other     
 crops. They control these by{spraying 
 with special sprays. Peas have waxy   
 leaves which makes water run off so a 
 spray is used which drips off their   
 leaves but clings to weeds and kills  
 them.{Combine harvesters}are used to  
 cut{cereal crops}in August and        
 September.                            </content>
