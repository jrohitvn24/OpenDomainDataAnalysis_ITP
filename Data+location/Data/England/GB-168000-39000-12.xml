		<content> Barncoose Hospital is situated between
 Redruth and Camborne. It has been     
 helping the older people of the area  
 for over 100 years. It takes people   
 from a ten-mile radius.               
    The hospital has had an extension  
 built and the old section has been    
 modernised.There is a kitchen for the 
 patients which is a bit cramped but a 
 good idea.There are different wards   
 for the patients, one for male and the
 other for female.Outside the door are 
 steps for people who can walk and a   
 ramp for wheelchairs.Each ward has a  
 day room which has a television and a 
 video,a radio and some books.The      
 hospital is only used for elderly     
 patients and I would recommend it to  
 my own Grandparents. It is a very good
 and clean hospital.
