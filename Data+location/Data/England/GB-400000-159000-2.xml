		<title>02THE CASTLE AT DEVIZES.</title>
		<content> Devizes Castle may best be described  
 as a Victorian folly built in 1860 by 
 Robert Valentine Leach.It was bought  
 in 1950,the lead removed from the roof
 and the building converted into one   
 main flat with nineteen rooms,owned by
 Mrs.Kemp and two smaller flats.       
 The Castle is thought to be haunted,a 
 ghost having been sighted by a member 
 of the Kemp family.                   
 The main flat still uses oil stoves   
 and large open fires and the Castle is
 connected to the mains for electricity
 and drainage.                         
 Surrounding the buildings are         
 extensive grounds of three acres      
 mainly grass and shrubs,the upkeep of 
 which is shared by the tennants.      
 During the last war,the Italians were 
 imprisoned between its walls.
