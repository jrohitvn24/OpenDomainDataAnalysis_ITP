		<title>02PAKEFIELD PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content>Thousands of years ago a large sarcen  
stone was brought hundreds of miles by 
glaciers, deposited on this site and,  
later, became a centre of worship. The 
church of All Saints and St. Margaret, 
built over this stone is, to-day, a    
prominent {landmark}, being situated on
the very edge of the cliff. The        
{church} is unusual in that it was     
once two medieties with two parallel   
naves separated by a wall.  Parts of   
the present church date from the 14th  
century. The two churches were         
combined into one in the 15th century. 
During World War II a German           
incendiary bomb ignited the thatch and 
almost completely destroyed the        
church. It was rebuilt in 1951 in the  
original style using the same local    
flint. The square tower houses 8 bells 
which are rung regularly for services.
