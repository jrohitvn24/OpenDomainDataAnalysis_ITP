		<title>04TRANSPORT IN SADDLEWORTH</title>
		<content> 4 trans-Pennine routes originally     
 crossed this area: 2 turnpike roads,  
 the Huddersfield Canal and the Leeds- 
 Stalybridge railway.                  
 Present main roads are to Huddersfield
 (A62) &amp; Holmfirth (A635) both from    
 Manchester. There is a bus service    
 through Diggle village to Oldham.     
 The Huddersfield Narrow Canal was the 
 second navigational system to cross   
 the Pennines and was completed in 1811
 amidst great celebrations, but was    
 officially abandoned in 1944 due to a 
 decline in traffic. Conservation work 
 is now in progress to restore it.     
 The main railway line from Stalybridge
 to Huddersfield was opened in 1849 &amp; a
 branch line carried passengers, called
 "Delph Donkey Line". There was once a 
 station at Diggle, now closed, and the
 last passenger train ran in April 1955
 so the main line now is freight only. </content>
