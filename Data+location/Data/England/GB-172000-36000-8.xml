		<title>08Stithians Parish  Council.</title>
		<content> The Parish Council which has eleven   
 elected members meets on the first    
 Monday of each month. The public can  
 attend as observers. The Council tries
 to make improvements e.g. in street   
 lighting and providing litter bins.   
 It maintains the playing fields and   
 public footpaths. Much of the work of 
 the parish council e.g. the conditions
 of the roads is passed on to the      
 county council. They would like more  
 people to take interest in the        
 village and would attend the meetings.
 They would also like more people to   
 write letters to them. The work of the
 council is going to be helped by a    
 newly formed residents association    
 which will be able to raise its own   
 money for things it wants to do,      
 something the parish council can't do.
