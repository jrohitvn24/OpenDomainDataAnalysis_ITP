		<content>   The company was started in 1920,    
 and it is run by Mrs Whitehouse.      
 The company makes greenhouses out of  
{Western Red Cedar.} They buy the wood 
 in lengths of between 8 and 22 feet   
 long (2.5m-7m).  There are 14 people  
 working for the firm.   They take 4   
 days to make a small greenhouse, and  
 up to a month to build a large one.   
 A small greenhouse will cost less     
 than Â£100.  They make about 200 green-
 houses per year.                      
   They sell greenhouses all over the  
 UK, but{deliver}them only in the      
 South-East.  They{export}to Germany   
 and Canada.  Before it is delivered   
 to the customer every greenhouse is   
{erected}at the factory; then it is    
{dismantled}to be taken to the         
 customer.                             
   Wooden-framed greenhouses are in    
{competition}with aluminium-framed.    </content>
