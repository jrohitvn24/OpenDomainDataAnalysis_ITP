		<content>{EMPLOYMENT QUESTIONNAIRE; FOR D-BLOCK.
                                       
     As part of our Domesday survey we 
 sent out a questionaire through pupils
 in our school who lived in the survey 
 area concerning employment and        
 migration. We recieved 54 replies,    
 which was less than half of those sent
 out,but is still a usefull sample     
 size.                                 
     The questionaires were interpreted
 using bar charts for each of the ten  
 questions,allowing us to work out     
 averages and trends from the raw      
 data.These,along with conclusions     
 drawn up by a Sixth-Form Geography set
 can be seen on pages 2-7.             
     The nature of the survey was quite
 sporadic and the results are by no    
 means comprehensive,but it is felt    
 that the conclusions can be taken as  
 being representative of the area.     </content>
