		<title>07BLACKPOOL BRIDGE</title>
		<content>   Blackpool Bridge is the part of the 
 forest where 'the forest's most scenic
 road' joins the B4431. The bridge once
 carried the railway line from the     
 forest's mining areas to the main line
 from Gloucester to S. Wales. Near the 
 bridge there is an exposed section of 
 Roman road some 20 metres long and 2.5
 metres wide. Some people believe the  
 road existed in pre-Roman times and   
 that they adopted it and re-paved it. 
 This exposed section reveals the road 
 to be well edged; the original line of
 the road through Blackpool Brook      
 is clearly visible as is the later    
 easterly diversion over a narrow      
 bridge which now carries this scenic  
 road.                                 
   The nearby notice reads,"ROMAN ROAD 
 - LYNDEY TO MITCHELDEAN - KNOWN LENGTH
 10\ MILES - PROBABLY 1ST OR 2ND       
 CENTURY A.D."                         </content>
