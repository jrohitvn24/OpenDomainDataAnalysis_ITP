		<title>03LIFE AT HORTON SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   I do not want Horton School to close
 because I would lose  my friends. My  
 other school was much bigger and the  
 Infants and Juniors were split up. In 
 the morning,after the register, we go 
 to Assembly and have a story out of   
 the Bible and sing hymns. I think     
 Horton School is good compared with   
 most other schools because of the     
 activities. Behind the school is a    
 hill where people put cows in the     
 Spring. We go for walks to look at    
 interesting things. We have a little  
 bit of garden each where we have      
 planted flowers. Inside we do Maths,  
 English,Reading,Painting,Science and  
 Handwriting.We have very good trips   
 and learn to play brass instruments   
 and the recorder. We also have a      
 B.B.C.computer and do woodwork.I can't
 see just because it is small why      
 anyone should want to close it down.  </content>
