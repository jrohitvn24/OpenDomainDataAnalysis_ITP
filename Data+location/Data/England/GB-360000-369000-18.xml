		<title>18GOLF CLUB,SANDIWAY</title>
		<content> The club has competitions every week  
 with prizes for each and one main     
 tournament where people from other    
 clubs come to play.  For the          
 competitions the course is kept in    
 good condition by 6 full-time         
 groundsmen.                           
 The shop there is owned by a          
 professional golfer.  People can have 
 lessons and hire or buy all golfing   
 equipment from him.  Each Sunday he   
 gives lessons to enthusiastic juniors.
  In the future new changing-rooms and 
 lounges for the lady members are to be
 built.
