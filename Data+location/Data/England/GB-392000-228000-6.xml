		<content> There are few opportunities for       
 employment inside the area. Even      
 farming which is highly mechanised and
 family run employs very few people.   
 The 1981 census shows less than two   
 percent employed in agriculture. The  
 area is influenced and indeed         
 dominated by the nearby towns and     
 industries. People travel out of the  
 area to work in factories such as     
 Smiths aerospace and in the shops and 
 offices of Cheltenham. The majority of
 people work in service industries;    
 insurance, banking, local government  
 and the Government Communications     
 Headquarters in Cheltenham are all    
 particularly important. The motor car 
 has allowed the wealthier members of  
 society a much greater freedom of     
 choice as to where they live and work.
