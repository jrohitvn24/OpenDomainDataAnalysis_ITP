		<title>20Millfield Nursery.</title>
		<content> Mr. John Miller owns the Millfield    
 Nurserys in Olveston. He opened the   
 garden centre in 1977. His days start 
 at 9.00a.m. and finishes at 5.30p.m.  
 He is open seven days a week but does 
 close for two months in the Winter.   
 His stock mainly consist of shrubs,   
 conifer trees, bedding and vegetable  
 plants. The most popular plants he    
 sells are his bedding plants. Many of 
 these can be seen in gardens in and   
 around Olveston. A large amount of    
 trade comes from just passers-by      
 because the nursery is conveniently   
 positioned on one of the roads which  
 passes through the village. Mr.       
 Miller's personal preference in his   
 stock are his bedding plants and      
 conifers.
