		<title>16THE MAYOR'S WEIGHING IN</title>
		<content>{The Weighing-in}is a very old and     
 colourful tradition of the Borough    
 Council, which takes place every June 
 outside the{Falcon Hotel}in the High  
 Street. The ceremony is belived to    
 date from{Medieval times,}but it died 
 out in 1500 and was not revived again 
 until 1917. The weighing machine used 
 to take 24 stone. The present machine 
 is a scale with a red velvet seat,    
 suspended from an overhead dial which 
 hangs from a large brass canopy.      
{The heaviest weight}ever recorded was 
 in 1960 when{Councillor K.A.Wood      
 weighed in at 20 stone 4 pounds. If   
 the Mayor has gained weight over the  
 year the mace-bearer, shouts the      
 weight with the words{"and some more" 
 the crowd then jeer and boo because it
 is said the Mayor lived well at the   
 ratepayers expense. If weight is less,
 the Mayor is said to have done well.  </content>
