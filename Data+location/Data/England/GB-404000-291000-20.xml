		<title>20LIVING IN GREAT BARR-Emma</title>
		<content>My name is Emma Lewins and I live in   
Great Barr.I like living in Great      
Barr because my mom and dad run a      
shop.We live above the shop.I don't    
like living in Great Barr for a few    
reasons:one because you have to do hard
work.Two, there is hardly anywhere     
to play out.Three, it is by a main     
road,and my brother keeps going on     
about cars.There is a row of shops     
along on the same side.There is also   
another row of shops on the other      
side.The road I live on is the Walsall 
Road.Next to the Walsall Road are four 
roads.One is Queslett then there is one
called Calshot and there is also two   
other roads but I can't remember their 
names.Also next to us is the motorway.
