		<title>05 Soap Operas On T. V.</title>
		<content>    Soap operas are some peoples       
enjoyment , yet some peoples non       
enjoyment . Some peopleturn them off   
the T.V saying they don'tseem anything 
likepeoples way of living but most     
enjoy and live on them . Most soap     
operas are from America , like Dallas  
and Dynasty , but there are some from  
Britain like Coranation Street and the 
latest one East Enders . The T.V       
programes are about a family or        
something and are acted out by acters  
. They show happenings of things that  
may happen in our life . Because it is 
on T.V it has to be exciting  , thats  
why some people turn them off saying   
its not true to life , but whats the   
point in makingthem so exciting ? When 
soap operas are shown on T.V it        
sometimes shows on little kids , but it
shos enjoyment to some people like me
