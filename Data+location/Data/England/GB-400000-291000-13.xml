		<title>13Housing in West Bromwich</title>
		<content> The area features a variety of        
 accommodation ranging from a 19th     
 century farm-house to bedsitters in   
 the YMCA.                             
 Sandwell council provides a higher    
 than national average of council      
 housing. This council accommodation is
 mainly semi-detached houses but also  
 includes maisonettes and high-rise    
 tower blocks. Currently there is a    
 policy to move families out of these  
 blocks into houses and to replace them
 with single people. Vandalism like    
 graffiti and broken lifts has proved a
 problem in tower blocks and some are  
 now being demolished. Housing         
 associations provide for single people
 and couples.  Private houses range    
 from                                  
 villas at Â£10,000 to large detached   
 houses with gardens and garage        
 costing Â£50,000                       </content>
