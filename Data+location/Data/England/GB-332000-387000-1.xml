		<title>01ST. CLEOPAS SCHOOL</title>
		<content>  Our school is called{St. Cleopas     
{School.}There has been a St. Cleopas  
 School on this site since 1871. St.   
 Cleopas church was a famous local     
 landmark with its very tall spire. The
 church was demolished this year as    
 extensive repairs were required which 
 were too expensive to carry out. Our  
 school is a modern single storey      
 building of an Open - Plan design. We 
 are a{Church of England}Junior and    
 Infant Mixed school. Our school has a 
 reputation for work in{Science,}      
{Environmental Studies and Computers.} 
 We have been involved, this year, in  
 work for a Primary Computing Fair,    
 a local Art and Craft exhibition and a
 choral performance at the Liverpool   
 Festival Gardens (the re-opened       
 International Garden Festival.)
