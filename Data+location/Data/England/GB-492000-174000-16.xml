		<title>16Private Housing in Windsor.</title>
		<content>   West Windsor is a very{expensive    
{place to live}in. The houses cost a   
 lot of money because there are a{lot  
{of jobs}in the area and because{travel
{is so easy.}There is the M4 to London,
 a{good train service}and{Heathrow     
{Airport}is nearby.                    
   Most of the houses were built in the
 1960's and 1970's. They cost between  
{Â£40000}for a terraced house with two  
 bedrooms to{Â£100000}for a detached    
 house with four bedrooms. There are   
 only a few luxury houses costing more 
 than that.                            
   The price of the houses has gone up 
 a lot in the last ten years and in the
 last two years it has{gone up by      
{fifteen per cent each year.           
   There are not many new houses being 
 built because most of the land is     
{Green Belt.
