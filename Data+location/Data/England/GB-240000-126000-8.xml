 In the village of Abbotsham there is a
 flourishing infant and Primary School 
 (church of England foundation) serving
 the children of Abbotsham or the      
 neighbouring parish of Alwington.     
 Alwington School closed some years    
 ago,but a successful amalgamation     
 followed. In addition to the          
 Headmaster, the staff consist of 3    
 full-time teachers and one part-time, 
 to serve 100 children. Although the   
 buildings are not modern-indeed they  
 form a pleasing architeclural group   
 with the church-they are conveniently 
  placed next to the playing field and 
 the parish playground.
