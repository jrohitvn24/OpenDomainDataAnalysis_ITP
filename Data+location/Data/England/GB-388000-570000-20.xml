		<title>20HUMSHAUGH  HOPES AND FEARS</title>
		<content> THE FEAR OF POSSIBLE ILLNESS AND      
 INCAPACITY IS REFLECTED IN A          
 FREQUENTLY EXPRESSED HOPE FOR A CURE  
 FOR{CANCER}IN THE NOT TOO-FAR-DISTANT 
 FUTRE.                                
 IN WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY AN AGRICULTURAL
 COMMUNITY, THE INCONSISTENCY AND      
 UNPREDICTABILITY OF THE{WEATHER}IS A  
 PROBLEM, PERHAPS HIGH-LIGHTED BY THE  
 VERY WET SUMMER OF 1985 WHICH HAS     
 CAUSED MAJOR PROBLEMS TO CROP{FARMERS:
 THE SHEEP FARMERS TOO HAVE THEIR      
 PROBLEMS, PARTICULARLY IN THE EARLY   
 PART OF THE YEAR WHICH BRINGS THE     
 "LAMBING STORMS".  IN THIS AREA, TOO, 
 ALL FARMERS (AND OTHERS!) HAVE TO COPE
 WITH THE SUDDEN NOISES OF LOW-FLYING  
{AIRCRAFT}TAKING PART IN THE FREQUENT  
 MILITARY EXERCISES WHICH ARE HELD.    
 DESPITE ALL THE PROBLEMS MOST PEOPLE  
 IN THIS AREA WOULD RATHER LIVE IN THE 
 COUNTRY THAN IN A TOWN.               </content>
