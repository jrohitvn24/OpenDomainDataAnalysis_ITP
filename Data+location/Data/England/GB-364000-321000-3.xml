		<content> Farming is important in the area of   
 Great Bolas.  We interviewed four     
 people at four farms,they were very   
 helpful.The people we interviewed were
 at Dodecote grange,Common farm,Manor  
 farm and Burliegh farm.The helpful    
 people were Mr.Lee,Mr.Maddocks,Mr.    
 Mitchell and a farmer who didn't tell 
 us his name.Mr.Maddocks who owns      
 Common farm also owns Burliegh farm.  
 His farming area consists of 850      
 acres.Mr.mitchell has 158 acres of    
 land.Mr.Lee has 110 acres,the other   
 man had 58 acres.Mr.Lee's crops were  
 barley,sugerbeet and wheat.The other  
 farmer had sugarbeet,potatoes,wheat   
 and barley.We asked the people whether
 they had been a farmer all their adult
 life.Most of them said they had exept 
 for Mr. Maddocks and Mr.Mitchell.It   
 was interesting to find out all about 
 Agriculture that day.                 </content>
