		<title>11THE OLD VICARAGE</title>
		<content> All the doors were made of pine. I    
 noticed that all the ceilings were    
 very high.Some of the doors were      
 arched which is very unusual, but     
 looks very nice. In some of the       
 bedrooms there were window seats which
 were low wide window sills  and you   
 could sit on them and store things in 
 them. Also upstairs there was a       
 bathroom which used to be a powder    
 room or wig room. It was called this  
 because women used to take off their  
 wigs in there and powder their heads  
 which had nearly all the hair shaved  
 off to stop their heads itching. The  
 wigs used to be in great fancy hair   
 styles. I thought that it was very    
 interesting and I would love to visit 
 'The Old Vicarage' again.
