		<title>02Willoughby's Legendary Horse</title>
		<content>  As a busy junction Willoughby had    
 sidings and shunting shire horses.    
 The story has it that such a horse    
 called "Dobbin" was killed by a train 
 while working in the yard about 60    
 years ago. A local poet records the   
 story. This is part of that poem:-    
  "It rushed through Alford's busy     
 station,hissing,blowing,wagons        
 clanking,                             
  A living thing, a powerful thing     
 driven on by fire and steam and cared 
 for by its driver.                    
  A thud, a shout, brakes screech,     
 sparks fly as metal wheels scrape     
  Metal lines grating to a halt too    
 late as further up the line it        
 stopped."       (Stuart Reder)        
  While the site of the yard was being 
 cleared  10 years ago a very large    
 horseshoe was found that is reputed to
 have belonged to Dobbin.              </content>
