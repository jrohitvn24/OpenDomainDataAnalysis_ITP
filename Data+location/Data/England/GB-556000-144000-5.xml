		<title>05The River Medway (cont.)</title>
		<content> Looters stole goods from shops but    
 most were arrested. By Monday morning 
 Tonbridge was a lake with little      
 islands. A herd of cows grazed on the 
 Castle lawn.{Â£1,000's}of damage was   
 caused, the Library lost{6000 books}  
 but, miraculously, no-one died.       
 Emergency Radio was used as telephone 
 lines were broken. As a result of the 
 flood the Flood Barrier was built. It 
 was begun in l978 and finished in 1981
 at a cost of Â£3.5m. It is controlled  
 electronically from Chatham.  The     
 Barrier provides reservoir storage    
 up-river. Many damaged buildings were 
 removed or rebuilt. Today the Medway  
 is used for leisure, fishing and      
 boating. New moorings have been       
 provided for narrow boats and lakes   
 developed from gravel pits on either  
 side of the town. Industry still uses 
 the wharfs as distribution centres.   </content>
