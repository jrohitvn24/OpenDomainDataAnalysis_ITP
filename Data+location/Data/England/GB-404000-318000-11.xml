		<title>11EVOLUTION OF RUGELEY</title>
		<content>   Rugeley owes its life to the market,
 transport and industry.               
   Rugeley had a livestock market which
 no longer exists. The market hall has 
 been demolished and replaced by a new 
 building housing 43 stalls selling    
 food and general goods.               
   The Trent Valley is a transport     
 corridor. Rugeley was on the coaching 
 route between Stafford and Lichfield  
 running parallel to Watling Street.   
 The River Trent is shallowing near    
 Rugeley but provided a passage for    
 boats. The Trent and Mersey Canal     
 provided much improved transport. The 
 railway had a lesser effect, the small
 station is 1 mile out of town.        
   Industry served local needs - iron, 
 leather, brewing etc. Industry is now 
 mainly coal mining, power stations    
 and electrical goods but with many    
 small service companies.              </content>
