		<title>13Sea Water Distillation Plant</title>
		<content> The distillation plant run by the{    
{Jersey New Waterworks Company}at      
 Corbiere was built in order to provide
 additional drinking water in times of 
 high demand or extreme drought. It was
 completed in{1970}at a cost of{Â£1.3   
{million}(it would cost Â£9 million     
 today).                               
 The plant distils water from the sea  
 by using a 47 "multi-flash" process at
 a{purity level}of{50 parts per million
 for drinking water. Sulphuric acid is 
 used in the scale control. It's       
 special feature is that it is a       
 completely self contained installation
 which includes the steam raising and  
 electrical generatng equipment. Its'{ 
{output capacity}is{1.5 million gallons
{per day}and it is capable of being in 
 operation for more than{300 days per  
{annum. It uses Â£8,000 worth of oil}and
{Â£175 worth of acid}per day.           </content>
