		<title>13Lower Denby Area</title>
		<content> Lower Denby is now a{small hamlet     
 comprising mainly of private houses   
 and cottages surrounded by farmland.  
 Some of the houses are very old being 
 originally weavers cottages, a smithy 
 and a small village school. One of the
 large houses in the area was built by 
 Sir Zachariah Hinchliffe who founded  
 the cloth mills in Denby Dale and was 
 knighted for the excellence of his    
 cloth that was sent to the Crimean    
 War. The parkland that he created is  
 now used for cattle grazing. The pub  
 at the junction of 5 roads changed its
 name in 1984 from The Junction to The 
 Dunkirk which is the local name for   
 the road junction. The house called   
 Papist Hall was originally called     
 Papist Hill Farm and legend says that 
 there is a{secret passage}from this   
 house to Gunthwaite Hall.
