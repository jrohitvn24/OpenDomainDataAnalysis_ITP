		<content>    Saturday  the 3rd of August was the
 day of the annual Flower Show held on 
 the recreation ground. There were     
 classes for adults in photography,    
 horticulture, cooking, wine making    
 needlework,floral art, besides some   
 for children in handwriting, craft and
 illustrations.                        
     Although the weather was uncertain
 it was well attended.                 
    A recipe for Old Sussex Carrot Cake
 using raw carrots and walnuts was to  
 be made for  class 63. The use of     
 marmalade with an orange helps to give
 it a delicious flavour.               
    All the profits from the show go   
 towards the upkeep of the village hall
 and the recreation ground.            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
