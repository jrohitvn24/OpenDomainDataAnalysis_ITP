    The Drawing Room is separated from 
 the Billiard room by some imitation   
 marble columns.  The fireplace is made
 of marble with a huge mirror framed in
 gold above.  There are statues all    
 around the room and paintings on the  
 walls.  This is a very beautiful room.
                                       
  {The Dinning Room                    
    Here you can see the Small chairs  
 that belonged to the Royal children.  
 Each chair has the name of the child  
 carved on the back.  The Queen layed  
 in state in this room before being    
 taken to Winsor.  There are lots of   
 pictures in here of the Queen's       
 children.
