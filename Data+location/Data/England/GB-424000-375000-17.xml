		<title>17HAYWOOD FARM</title>
		<content>  Haywood farm had no machinery        
 as it was only a small holding so     
 machinery and the tractor were        
 borrowed from Mr Crosslands big farm. 
  We made silage.Silage is when you do 
 not make hay.Grass is{silage}when you 
 cut the grass green and put mollases  
 in it, it is a sort of treacle and    
 that lasts for the winter.It smells   
 revolting but the animals do not mind 
 it. Long ago the pigs  were given pig 
 swill which was left over food or     
 rubbish but now pigs  are not given   
 this because of disease.              
  You also had to do{fencing and       
{walling.}The walling is made of grit  
 stone. Keeping the animals in was a   
 problem .{Water was a problem }as it  
 had to be brought to the animals from 
 the spring.{The spring was our water  
{supply.                               
                                       </content>
