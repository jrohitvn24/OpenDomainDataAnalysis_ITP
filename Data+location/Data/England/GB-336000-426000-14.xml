		<content>   Approximately 80 buses serve Lytham 
 per day.These are a mixture of Fylde  
 Ribble and Blackpool Borough Transport
 Some routes are; lla, l93,l67, 22a,   
 llc.  All bus routes stop in Lytham   
 Square.  There is no planned link     
 between bus and rail services.        
   The revolutionary railbus has saved 
 the closure of Lytham   and St. Annes 
 rail lines.  When the railbus enters  
 service in May l986 a new Blackpool   
 South-Ormskirk line is also to be     
 introduced.This service will operate  
 the latest bus-trains.The rail buses  
 are designed for a "Hop on Hop        
 off"service.The trains run from       
 Blackpool South to Kirkham;26  through
 Lytham each day.The station is now    
 delapidated and unmanned.Plans have   
 been made for the station to be       
 converted into a new shopping centre  
 /restaurant keeping Victorian style.  </content>
