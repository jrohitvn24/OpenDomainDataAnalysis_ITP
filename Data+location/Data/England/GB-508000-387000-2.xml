   From its early beginnings as a tiny 
 hamlet in the 11th. century, Market   
 Rasen has become the most important   
 settlement of the three bearing the   
 name Rasen(from the word meaning a    
 plank bridge). The present village of 
 Middle Rasen was originally the       
 'mother' settlement, Rasen Media. It  
 was not until 1180 that Rasen Parva   
 became a parish in its own right. The 
 church of St. Thomas was confirmed to 
 the Priory of Sixhills in 1189. Just  
 after this the power to hold a market 
 at East Rasen, as it was now called,  
 was given in 1219 as it was a suitable
 distance from other markets. By 1400  
 the name of Market Rasen was in use   
 and the village had become a centre   
 for the wool trade although Middle    
 Rasen had double the population(200 in
 Market Rasen)                         </content>
