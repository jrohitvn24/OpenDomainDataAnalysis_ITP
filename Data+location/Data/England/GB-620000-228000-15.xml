		<title>15Domesday and Dovercourt</title>
		<content>  The origins of Dovercourt gave us a  
 chance to look at some real{Local     
 History,and at the same time to see an
 original{Domesday}entry.              
 We found that our area is mentioned   
 although Harwich is not;an interesting
 piece of local rivalry!It seems that  
 the name is based upon the old Celtic 
 word "doer" or "dwrr",which meant     
 water.                                
 At the time of the Battle of Hastings 
 the land was held by the brother of   
 Harold Godwinson;one{Ulwin.}We didn't 
 discover what became of Ulwin,but the 
 land was given as one of many packages
 to{Aubrey de Vere}who was also the    
 Earl of Oxford and one of the         
 principal figures,in the settlement of
 East Anglia.In 1086,the land was      
 valued at the exhorbitant sum of      
 Â£12.00;a pity that the pound doesn't  
 purchase quite as much today!         </content>
