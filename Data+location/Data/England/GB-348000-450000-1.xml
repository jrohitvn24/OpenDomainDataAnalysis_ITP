		<title>01HOUSING IN FORTON</title>
		<content>  Most of the older houses are situated
 on Hollins Lane because this road used
 to be the main road before the A6 was 
 built in 1824. Most of these houses   
 are cottages and are quite            
 small,because a long time ago people  
 were either very poor or extremly rich
 and the poor ones could not afford    
 large houses.                         
  The houses round the school are more 
 modern,they are mostly semi_detached  
 though there are quite a few detached.
 There are only 3 people in our class  
 living in terraced houses,most of the 
 terraced houses in Forton are on      
 Coronation Avenue.The houses on this  
 avenue are council houses and can be  
 rented.                               
  Most of the semi_detached houses are 
 on Troutbeck Avenue and Lunesdale     
 Drive which are both Cul_de_sacs.
