		<title>05THE GREAT LAKE AT BEDGEBURY</title>
		<content>   This is an artificial lake, with a  
 dam at its north end, on a tributary  
 of the River Teise.  It has an area of
 about 7 hectares and is about 3 metres
 deep over much of this.  Besides      
 amenity and recreation, the impounded 
 water was used from 1855 till recently
 to drive a hydraulic ram to pump water
 to a nearby reservoir for supply to   
 local farms and dwellings.            
   The lake is used by the Cranbrook   
 and District Angling Club and by the  
 Bedgebury Park Sailing Club which has 
 a fleet of six Torch sailing dinghies 
 and a motor boat.                     
   Wildlife at present includes a pair 
 of mute swans, mallard ducks,         
 freshwater mussels and several species
 of fish.  In 1984 there was also a    
 pair of herons.  There are some areas 
 of water lilies and there is woodland 
 along three-quarters of its perimeter.</content>
