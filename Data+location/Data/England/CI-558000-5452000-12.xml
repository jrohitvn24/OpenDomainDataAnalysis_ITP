		<title>12The Jersey Cow</title>
		<content> The Jersey cow is coloured mainly fern
 brown and white and has an average    
 weight of 390kg and is about 120cm    
 high. A cow can produce ten times its 
 own body weight in milk annually. The 
 breed is thought to have originated in
 France. Jersey cows tend to live      
 longer than other breeds. The cows are
 fed on nuts, bran and water during the
 milking period. During 24 hours about 
 470 gallons is collected from 30      
 milking cows. The milk is kept in a   
 cooler and must stay at 5 degrees     
 C. During the morning the Jersey milk 
 tanker arrives to collect the milk. It
 is taken to the dairy at Five Oaks    
 where it is checked for purity and    
 what is not required as milk is made  
 into yogurt, butter, cream or ice     
 cream. The milk is put into waxed     
 paper containers and distributed to   
 shops and houses.                     </content>
