		<title>11Houses &amp; Housing in Clun</title>
		<content> We carried out a house to house       
 survey to find out what we could      
 about dwellings in Clun. The survey   
 covered almost all the houses in      
 the township of Clun, but not the     
 surrounding area in our block. 65 % of
 the houses in Clun are made of stone, 
 31% are made of brick and 4% of other 
 materials.                            
 Approximately 56% of houses are owner 
 occupied, 21% are council tenants, 9% 
 are private tenants, 5% are holiday   
 homes and the rest are occupied under 
 other arrangements.                   
 35% were built before 1800, 18%       
 between 1800 and 1900, 15% between    
 1900 and 1930, 16% between 1930 and   
 1970 and 16% since 1970.              
 43% are semi detached houses, 37% are 
 detached, 15% are terraced and there  
 are a small number of flats which have
 been converted from bigger houses.    </content>
