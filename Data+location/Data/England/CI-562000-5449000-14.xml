		<title>14ST THOMAS'S CH. &amp; GLASS CH.</title>
		<content>{St Thomas's church }is the main {     
{Catholic }church in Jersey.It was     
 built in 1884 and renovated in 1983.  
 It is called the {French Church }     
 because mostly French people used it, 
 and all the priests are French.       
 Nowadays{French,English and Portugese}
 people use it.                        
{                                      
{The Glass Church}(1842) is next to{   
{Coronation Park}.It is unique because 
 of the major 1930s renovation with    
{glass font} and {chancel}designed by {
{Rene Lalique}..The church is not only 
 glass - the floors are Portland stone 
 and the walls are Bath stone.The glass
 work bears a lily which is the sign of
 purity. As you enter the church you   
 see two beautiful lamps.On the door   
 panels are two angels and there are   
 two glass doors by the chancel.
