		<content> Bullenshaw Old People's Home used to  
 be a farm. We interviewed  three      
 ladies who said they liked the home   
 and company very much. They looked    
 happy and well cared for.             
 They had strong opinions on what they 
 liked and disliked, for instance,they 
 liked old money, modern music and     
 modern fashion, but they did not like 
 Punk hairdos. They said that the      
 teachers at their schools weren't very
 strict but instead the pupils had to  
 do a daily drill. They were taught    
 English and maths but no cookery. The 
 ladies left school at thirteen and got
 jobs in factories. Men worked in the  
 pit or in a factory.
