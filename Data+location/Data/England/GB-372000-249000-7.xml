      Educational provision began in   
 Suckley in 1628, when a Mr. J. Palmer 
 bequeathed Â£100 to provide for a      
 schoolmaster to teach ten boys 'read- 
 ing, writing and the rudiments of     
 arithmetic'.  The school was in a room
 adjoining the church until 1877, when 
 the church was demolished.  It was    
 replaced by a Board school, which     
 opened on 12th February, 1877 to      
 accommodate 136 children and which    
 cost Â£1,900.  It was extended in 1905 
 to house 150 children.  Suckley       
 Primary School now caters for children
 from the district and, since 1984,    
 from Alfrick when that school closed. 
 Children of secondary age are         
 transported to high schools at        
 Malvern.
