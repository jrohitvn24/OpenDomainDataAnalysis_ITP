		<title>14THE OLD FORGE COTTAGE</title>
		<content> The Old Forge Cottage is situated in  
 the Borough of Eastleigh.The outside  
 of the house is painted white with    
 Tudor style wooden beams.In the garden
 there is a Yew tree,it is shaped like 
 a bell.It is 30 feet high and is      
 trimed every year.The garden once     
 contained two thatched stables,a few  
 pigstyes,and a Black-smith's shop.    
 Inside the cottage there are ten small
 rooms:a kitchen,a dairy, three        
 bedrooms,a dining room,a study,a      
 lounge,a hall and a loft room.Half of 
 the lounge was the Black-smith's shop.
 Underneath the lounge floor there is a
 box which the present owner hid for   
 people in the future to find.The      
 contents are some pictures of the     
 owner's family,a bus ticket,an old    
 penny and an old pound note.          
 Some of the walls are made of wattle  
 and daub.                             </content>
