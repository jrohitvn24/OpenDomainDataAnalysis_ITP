		<content> When our parents were our age they    
 played games like,tinwhip,deligo,and  
 marbles.33% then had a car,now 75%    
 have one.Since those days schools have
 changed.Dicipline was more strict and 
 you got the cane.Village life has     
 changed very little,there used to be a
 brook in the street but now it's      
 blocked up and some old houses have   
 been knocked down.The pub replaces    
 them now.1/6d,2/6d and a crown was    
 usually their pocket money.Some got   
 none.They usually spent it on sweets  
 or the pictures.The fashions were bell
 legged trousers and mini skirts.In    
 their spare time they would go for a  
 walk or listen to the radio.50% had   
 bikes then,now 80% have bikes.Our     
 living conditions have changed a lot  
 since then,because now we have modern 
 machines to use.
