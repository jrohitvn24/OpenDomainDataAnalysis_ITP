		<title>07   KINGSWEAR LOWER FERRY</title>
		<content>                                       
 There has been a ferry in Kingswear   
 for a long time.The first ferry was   
 probably a rowing boat.The first      
 record of the ferry was in 1805.It is 
 now owned by South Hams District      
 Council.                              
   The Lower Car Ferry crosses between 
 Dartmouth and Kingswear.The ferry     
 really is a float with a tug that     
 pulls it across the river.The float   
 can fit two rows of four cars and 65  
 people on.When the ferry is empty it  
 can carry 100 people.The car ferry    
 crosses the river eight times an hour 
 for 16 hours a day.                   
   In July and August nearly 1000 cars 
 cross each day.                       
   To cross the river it costs:        
  15pence for children,25 pence for    
 adults,Â£1.15 for cars.
