		<content> Buck's Mills,overlooking Bideford Bay,
 was once a "living village", but now  
 has only nine cottages permantly      
 occupied.The remainder are second     
 homes or holiday lets.It is a small   
 linear village approached by a steep  
 road with woods on both sides.The wood
 on the righthand side is run by the   
 Forestry Commission.A stream which    
 runs down the right hand side and ends
 in a waterfall on the beach,forms the 
 boundary between Woolsery parish and  
 Parkham parish.The land rises sharply 
 to the east of the stream and is      
 mostly scrubland and more woodland.A  
 striking feature of the village is    
 that there are no children there.Many 
 years ago there was a public house    
 near the slipway known as the Coffin  
 Arms now it is a holiday cottage.
