    THE PARK IS SET OUT IN A SERIES OF 
 AVENUES.{THE BROAD AVENUE RUNS FROM   
{CIRENCESTER TO SAPPERTON FOR SOME SIX 
{MILES AND IS THE LONGEST IN BRITAIN.  
 THIS IS  CROSSED  BY  THE  TEN  RIDES.
 THERE ARE OVER SIXTY MILES OF GRASS   
 RIDES .                               
     THE WOODLAND LANDSCAPE HAS CHANGED
 LITTLE SINCE IT WAS FIRST PLANTED. THE
 HARDWOOS,{SYCAMORE, ASH AND BEECH}GROW
 NATURALLY. ALTHOUGH FAMOUS FOR ITS    
 BEECHES,{LARCH, SCOTS PINE AND SPRUCE}
 ARE PLANTED AMONG THE HARDWOODS TO    
 CONTINUE THE MIXED PLANTATIONS OF THE 
 ORIGINAL PLAN.                        
     TWO FOLLIES WERE BUILT.ONE WAS    
{POPE'S SEAT A 'RUSTICATED BUILDING'}  
 TYPICAL OF THE TIMES.IT WAS A STONE   
 SUMMER HOUSE CONSTRUCTED AT THE       
 JUNCTION SO THAT THE VIEW DOWN THE    
 SEVEN RIDES COULD BE ENJOYED.         </content>
