		<title>01AN INTRODUCTION TO QUERNMORE</title>
		<content>                                       
Our area is hilly,with Clougha Pike    
1325 feet high and the fells beyond    
rising to 1500 feet.From Clougha you   
get a lovely view of Quernmore         
valley,the city of Lancaster and the   
Lake District hills.On a really clear  
day you can see the Isle of Man.Quite  
a lot of the fells belong to the Duke  
of Westminster and his gamekeepers rear
grouse.                                
     There are six farms which mostly  
have sheep because it is hilly but they
also have cattle.On one of the farms   
lives Mr.Tim Longton who is a very     
famous sheep dog handler.              
     In Roman times the Romans made    
quernstones from the hard rock and     
that's where Quernmore got its name    
from.It isn't pronounced like you'd    
expect,it rhymes with warmer.
