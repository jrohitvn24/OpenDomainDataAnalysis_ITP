		<title>06Christy Towels of Manchester</title>
		<content>    The factory was built in 1830 and  
 was opened in 1837. It was a shirt    
 factory to begin with.                
    About 340 people work there. They  
 make 50,000 towels a week. Cotton,    
 yarn, trimmings and labels are used in
 the making of towels. The yarn comes  
 from Portugal, Spain, Russia and      
 Turkey, and the trimmings come from   
 Switzerand. Tools used in the         
 manufacturing processes are scissors, 
 reed hooks, snips, electric shears and
 knotters. Machines are used too. The  
 workers do not have to wear overalls, 
 but they are allowed to if they want. 
 The weaving is noisy and people who   
 work on the weaving machines have to  
 wear pops which are a kind of ear muff
 for protecting their ears. Christys   
 only sell their goods in Britain. The 
 canal used to be used for transport   
 but now it is used for power.         </content>
