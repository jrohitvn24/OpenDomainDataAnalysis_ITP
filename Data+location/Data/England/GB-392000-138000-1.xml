		<title>01Typical Rural Wiltshire</title>
		<content> This area holds three small villages, 
 all in the valley of the River Wylye. 
 The surrounding countryside is mainly 
 agricultural; in the valley almost    
 entirely grazing pasture for cattle   
 and sheep.   The Bristol-Southampton  
 railway runs through the valley, as   
 does A36 main road (Salisbury-Bath).  
 To the north and south the land is    
 undulating downland, mainly           
 agricultural with some natural        
 deciduous woods.   The area is        
 designated an area of outstanding     
 natural beauty and contains           
 conservation areas.   The population  
 is very mixed, some retired, some     
 agricultural, some employed in nearby 
 towns such as Salisbury, Bath,        
 Warminster.   Also a few weekenders.
