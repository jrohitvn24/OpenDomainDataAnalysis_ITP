		<content> The Kennet and Avon Canal connecting  
 Bath with Newbury was opened in 1810. 
 It passes through Devizes and at      
 the Wharf two warehouses were built.  
 In the 1840's trade dropped when the  
 railway line and the warehouses were  
 leased out to merchants.              
 In the 1970's the County Council      
 leased the area to the Kennet District
 Council for recreation and amenity    
 purposes.  In 1979 the Wharf Theatre  
 established itself in the Canal Side  
 Wharehouse.In the early 1980's the    
 Kennet and Avon Canal Trust took over 
 the other warehouse which now houses  
 the Tourist Information Office,       
 meeting rooms, a canal museum, and    
 rooms for storage and workshops.  In  
 the Theatre plays are put on once a   
 month.Theatre company members act     
 there, but invited societies also     
 perform.  {(See also page 20.)}       </content>
