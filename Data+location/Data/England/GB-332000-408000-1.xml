		<content> THE THREE MOSSES                      
 The designated area is to be referred 
 to as the 'Three Mosses' consisting   
 of, at the lower or southern section  
 of the area - Downholland Moss, Barton
 Moss at the centre and Plex Moss at   
 the top or northern section.  This    
 section of land is drained peat moss  
 and used for agriculture. Small       
 coppices of mixed trees afford cover  
 to game birds such as pheasant &amp;      
 partridge which roam freely.   The    
 narrow roads usually of the single    
 track variety, are built across the   
 mosses on a causeway type of          
 structure, and are now, due to        
 drainage, several feet above the      
 surrounding land.  The remnants of a  
 disused railway track disect the lower
 eastern and western two sections of   
 this area, part of which is a Nature  
 Reserve.                              </content>
