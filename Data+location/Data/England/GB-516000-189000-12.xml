		<title>12HOUSING IN EAST HARROW</title>
		<content>    Semi-detached houses are the most  
 popular type of house in this area.   
 Terraced houses are the second most   
 common.                               
    Houses in Stanmore and northern    
 Edgware are larger and more expensive 
 than in other parts of the D-Block.   
 People who live in these districts    
 tend to be well-off and rather older  
 than elsewhere. Many of the larger    
 houses have between 12 and 15 living  
 rooms.                                
    In other parts of the D-Block,     
 houses have fewer habitable rooms.    
 Many of the roads surveyed have a wide
 variety of housing types in them. All 
 but a few were built of bricks and    
 mortar.                               
    There are relatively few blocks of 
 flats in the area. A large proportion 
 of houses are privately owned.
