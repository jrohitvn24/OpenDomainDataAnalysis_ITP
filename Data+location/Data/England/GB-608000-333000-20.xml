		<title>20AND EDGEFIELD NOW</title>
		<content> The farmer's  wife went on,"It's like 
 two generations missing, there are so 
 few teenagers and 20year olds. The    
 youngsters have to go, not just for   
 work, but to get a house. The council 
 isn't building any, and the old ones  
 are too expensive. Nearly all the     
 young men who were at school with my  
 boys have gone now. Farming's changed 
 -the hedges have gone to make bigger  
 fields, everything gets sprayed with  
 weedkillers and pesticides, where     
 there were five men working there's   
 now only one. It's nearly all retired 
 people moving in, from all over the   
 country -foreigners." She said the    
 last word with a twinkle, and one     
 knows that she is still happy to live 
 in Edgefield and welcome 'foreigners' 
 to it.
