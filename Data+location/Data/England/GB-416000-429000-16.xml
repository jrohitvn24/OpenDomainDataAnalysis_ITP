		<title>16Farming in South Bradford.</title>
		<content> Up to{1939}there were about{14 farms,}
 average size 40 acres,in the vicinity 
 of East Bierley.These small farms were
 mainly concerned with{dairying}and the
 growing of{corn and wheat.}Root crop  
 growing often provided food for cattle
 therefore growing{mangolds}was        
 popular.The soil is generally quite   
 poor and stoney being boulder clay.   
 After the 2nd World War many small    
 farms went out of business because of 
 a shortage of cheap labour and the    
 raising of rents.By the{1950's}only a 
{few}local{farms}existed.Dairying and  
 agricultural farming are the main     
 forms of farming today with           
 considerable areas given over to grass
 growing for{hay}making and{silage.}   
 There are{now}only{2 farms}in our     
 'block'.Any other farms are now       
 smallholdings or specialist grass     
 growing.                              </content>
