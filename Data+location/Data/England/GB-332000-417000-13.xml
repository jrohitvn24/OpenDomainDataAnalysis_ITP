		<title>13The Queens Visit in 1985</title>
		<content> On 29th June at 10 o'clock the Queen  
 was visiting Southport.She arrived at 
 Southport Station,and the Mayor       
 greeted her.Many people took          
 photographs.The Queen entered her car 
 and it drove down London Street.When  
 the Queen came from her train Colonel 
 Hesketh and Lady Hesketh were there.  
 Her Majesty was on a brief visit      
 because she was going to inspect      
 troops at Altcar.When they passed the 
 Scarisbrick Hotel the staff let       
 hundreds of balloons go.Alot of people
 watched the Queen pass and waved the  
 Union Flags.Our estimate of the number
 of people present is over 1,000.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
