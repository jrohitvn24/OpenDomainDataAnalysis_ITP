		<content> In Torquay there are many small hotels
 and guest houses. There are also some 
 whoppers like The Imperial and The    
 Palace. The small places only have    
 'Bed and Breakfast'. Prices range from
 Â£5-8 per night. Many people earn extra
 money through this way or by working  
 on the beach and so on. In summer the 
 population nearly doubles with        
 Grockles (holiday makers) and foreign 
 students. Torquay has a lot to offer  
 the average tourist: hot weather,     
 night clubs, parks, a marina, ice     
 creams and sand. Those who live here  
 don't have quite such a view of it    
 because it's so crowded in summer!!!  
 Five minutes from the beach is the old
 village of Cockington with lots of    
 thatched cottages. People (in summer) 
 pay Â£'s just to go there in a horse   
 and cart. Still, if not for the       
 tourists Torquay wouldn't be here.    </content>
