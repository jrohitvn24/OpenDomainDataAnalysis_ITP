		<title>01 ROSSENDALE</title>
		<content>  Our area of Rossendale is made up of 
 a string of settlements dotted along  
 the valley of the{River Irwell.}The   
 main town of {Rawtenstall             
 (pop.approx.30 000)is in the the west 
 of the valley while to the east are   
 the suburts of Newchurch and Cloughold
 .These in turn merge into the small   
 town of Waterfoot to the east of our  
 area. The countryside is of high      
 moors{(Cowpe Hill 439m)}with the main 
 routes in the valley bottom.          
  The decline of the local{shoe/slipper
 industry,along with the opening of a  
 motorway link{(M66)}south,has seen    
 Rawtenstall become a dormitory of     
 Manchester.This commuter population   
 has been the cause of a large private 
 house building programme.With         
 goverment assisted 'Enterprize Zone'  
 status the valley has seen some growth
 in small businesses.                  </content>
