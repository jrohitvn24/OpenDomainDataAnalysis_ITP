		<title>05LAND COVER AT MEDMENHAM</title>
		<content> This area of mainly woodland is       
 bisected by the A4155 Marlow-Henley   
 road.                                 
   The woodland is mainly beech due to 
 the chalk and flint deposits but      
 oak,fir,pine,elderberry,silver birch  
 and hawthorn are also found and in May
 many patches are covered in bluebells.
 It is the habitat of many small       
 mammals such as squirrels and         
 rabbits.It is well served by          
 footpaths.                            
   Between 10.50 a.m and 11.50 a.m on  
 the 4th July 1985 816 cars travelled  
 along the road.This is much heavier   
 traffic than usual due to the Henley  
 Regatta.
