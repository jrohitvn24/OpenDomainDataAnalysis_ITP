		<content> Many theories are held as to the      
 origin of the name of the town which  
 was first mentioned in the Doomsday   
 survey of 1086 as Fredston.The most   
 recent theory being that it comes from
 a compound of four and stan meaning 4 
 stones,depicting an ancient cromlech  
 consisting of 3 uprights and a head-  
 stone which at one time may have been 
 situated there.The old mansion of     
 Aketon Hall is of some historic       
 interest having been the home of the  
 Fetherston family during the          
 Plantagent period.The date of the     
 foundation of the Parish Church is    
 unknown but the church is mentioned in
 The Domesday Book.This church was     
 given Robert De Lacey to his newly    
 founded Priory of Nostell until the   
 Reformation,when it was given by Henry
 V111 to the Dean and Chapter of Christ
 Church Oxford,who are todays patrons. </content>
