		<content>Both villages are served by small      
shops. Barby has a Post Office, a      
garage, two grocers, a butchers shop   
and a nursery garden but a survey has  
shown that people prefer to shop in    
the neighbouring towns.  The village   
shops are generally used only as a     
back up facility.  Prices in the       
village shops are higher but this may  
be offset by a saving in transport     
costs. Our survey has found that       
56% of the consumers shop in Rugby,    
14% shop in Daventry, 16% shop in      
Northampton and 14% shop in Coventry.  
Occasionally people travel to Milton   
Keynes, Birmingham, Leamington and     
London and some people shop through    
mail order catalogues.
