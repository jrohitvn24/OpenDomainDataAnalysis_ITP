		<content> We do not have the chance to see many 
 live plays in Rothbury. However, when 
 the Northumberland Theatre Company is 
 touring the county, there is always a 
 performance in the village.           
 This generally happens two or three   
 times a year.                         
 The third and fourth yer children in  
 our school also take part in play     
 productions which are performed in the
 school hall for parents.              
 We have had two plays this year. First
 there was the "Spindlestone Dragon"   
 which was very successful, then we had
 "The Root of Evil" which is a medieval
 play.                                 
 "The Root of Evil" was also performed 
 one Sunday morning outside Brinkburn  
 Priory. As it was a sunny day, we were
 able to have our picnic lunch on the  
 grass after the performance.
