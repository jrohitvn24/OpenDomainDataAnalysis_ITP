     "WREA GREEN FIELD DAY" is the name
given to the local Gala day.   It has  
been held annually for 60 years on the 
village Green at the end of June.      
The afternoon starts with a procession 
of villagers in fancy dress but before 
the procession starts the entrants are 
judged and prizes given to the best.   
                                       
     After the first circuit of the    
Green the Rose Queen is crowned on a   
small decorated stage.   The next      
event is a Morris dance by the village 
girls followed by childrens races on   
the Green.                             
     After this is the chidrens tea    
which is held in the school.  The      
children then go on the fair which has 
many rides such as the Scrambler,      
Speedway and Waltzer.     An Adult     
Sports is held in the evening.         </content>
