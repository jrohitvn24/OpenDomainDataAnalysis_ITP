		<title>18PAPER MILL TO HOME IN N.CAVE</title>
		<content>    We knocked and the door opened.    
 Mrs. Judge said she had first come to 
 live at the mill in 1976 but had owned
 it previously.  She went on to talk   
 about how the walls had been changed  
 from wood to breeze blocks and the    
 Yorkshire slide windows were renewed. 
 Mostly the things are still original  
 like the pantile roof.  Inside you can
 tell as you move from the living to   
 the old mill working area.  When      
 builders were widening the drive they 
 dug up an old millstone now used as a 
 washing line base.  It must have been 
 used for corn milling too.  The mill  
 has been renovated beautifully.   Mrs.
 Judge said that the floor had to be   
 black asphalt to prevent damp rising. 
 She had rugs not fitted carpets.   It 
 all looked very nice.
