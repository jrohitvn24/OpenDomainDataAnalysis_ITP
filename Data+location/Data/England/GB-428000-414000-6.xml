		<content>  Painthorpe house was built during the
 1700's and was the Vicarage to        
 Chapelthorpe Curch before becoming a  
 country club. There is an old wall    
 running around the grounds and a gate 
 way shows where the main entrance once
 was. Inside, the grounds have been    
 converted into a golf course and the  
 convertion took place during the      
 1900's. At the back of the club, an   
 out-building has been converted into a
 canine beautitions and a hairdressing 
 salon. although an extension has been 
 added to hte front of the building,   
 the origional building is still used  
 and a gas lamp and several coloured   
 pain windows are traces of the old    
 house. On the second floor of the club
 is a store room. An outside staircase,
 which is reached by old stone steps,  
 leads to the store room which is said 
 to be haunted.                        </content>
