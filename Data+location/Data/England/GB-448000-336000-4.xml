		<title>04STAPLEFORD LIBRARY</title>
		<content>   The new Stapleford library was      
 opened in November,1983. It is an     
 open-plan building of two storeys, and
 is proving popular with all sections  
 of the reading community.             
   Besides containing books, the       
 library also has cassettes and records
 for loan. There are daily newspapers  
 and bus timetables for people to      
 consult.                              
   The library has special computers, a
 television which shows 'Ceefax', and a
 lift to take the elderly and the      
 handicapped to the upper floor.       
   A special feature is a small play   
 area for young children to use while  
 their parents are choosing books.     
   This, and the pleasant atmosphere   
 have combined to make it very popular.
