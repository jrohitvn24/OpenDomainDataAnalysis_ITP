		<content> A District Councillor from W. Grove   
 says he does not want any more houses 
 erected after those being built in    
 1985 are completed, as existing       
 amenities in Grove will not support   
 further growth. A new complex of 28   
 flats for the elderly, being built by 
 the Vale of White Horse District      
 Council are almost complete. A        
 Shopping Centre and possibly a church 
 is planned, but the site originally   
 reserved for a school, now has houses 
 built on it, since the birthrate has  
 declined. Alongside the BNF and Metal 
 Box factories may be put some starter 
 unit factories. The District Council  
 is currently battling with the County 
 Council for road improvement in W.    
 Grove. An appeal by the Council to    
 have moved the Early Warning Siren,   
 which is unsightly, may be successful.
