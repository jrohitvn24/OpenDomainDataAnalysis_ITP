		<title>04Wem Carnival</title>
		<content>   Long ago, people used to have       
 carnivals as a form of entertainment. 
 Wem Carnival began in 1927, and went  
 on to 1956. It was revived in 1981. As
 well as a form of entertainment, Wem  
 Carnival is also a fund raising event.
 The money raised goes to local        
 organisations. The carnival is run by 
 a committee of twelve local people.   
 The procession includes floats,dancing
 troupes and different types of        
 bands-people dressed up in bright     
 clothing. This year between 3 and 4   
 thousand people will take part with   
 70 floats, 52 dancing troupes and a   
 Carnival Queen all led by Wem Band.   
 This year the Carnival is on September
 7th-11th. The procession starts at    
 2 o'clock on the last day and takes   
 about an hour and a half to pass      
 through the town centre. It repeats   
 the route at 7.30 that night.         </content>
