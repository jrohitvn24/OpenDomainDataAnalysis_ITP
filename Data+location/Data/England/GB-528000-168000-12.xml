		<title>12In The Streets</title>
		<content> Sometimes in a quiet street children  
 play cricket. They use a lamp-post for
 the wickets, they might draw wickets  
 with stone on the lamp-posts.  It can 
 be very very annoying if a car is     
 parked right in front of it. Sometimes
 cars come along and you will have to  
 stop. Children play footbal against a 
 fence, but you have to be careful of  
 losing the ball, or they might smash a
 window.  They might even ride their   
 bikes around.                         
 IN PARKS OR OPEN FIELDS - They could  
 play football,or cricket. Sometimes   
 people play golf.  You will have to be
 careful that you don't lose the ball. 
 There are tennis courts and you have  
 to pay to play.  They climb trees.    
 They make ramps to jump over with     
 their bikes.
