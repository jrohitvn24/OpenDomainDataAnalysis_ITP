		<title>20Corporal Thomas's Day</title>
		<content>   Corporal Thomas gets up at six      
 o'clock, goes running, has a shower   
 and gets ready to go to work. He is a 
 section commander in the transport    
 corps. He makes sure that everybody is
 doing his job, it could be cleaning   
 cars or driving, and he sees no one is
 wasting time.                         
   Corporal Thomas has a tea break at  
 10:00 and is back at work by 10:30. He
 goes running at 12:30 and has a snack 
 lunch. He goes back to work at 13:30. 
   In the evening he goes to play      
 darts, goes for a run in the woods or 
 he goes to have a drink.
