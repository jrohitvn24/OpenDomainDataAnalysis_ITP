		<title>12My hobbies and Collections</title>
		<content>My hobbies are playing snooker         
collecting little boxes and collecting 
soldiers. I play snooker with my       
brother because we have a snooker      
table. My highest break so far is 32. I
am not sure what my brothers is, but it
is quite high. Nan and Pop's when they 
come, pops, Richard and I play snooker 
tournament. I collect little boxes like
match boxes and other small boxes. When
ever we finish a match box I always get
it and take it upstairs. When I've got 
a bit of time I always make something  
or put somethink in I've already got   
that is small. I like collecting       
soldiers because I like army. I have   
got about 350 soldiers which are about 
5 cm in height and I've got some       
smaller soldiers about 1.5 cm high.    
I've got a castle, tanks, ships,       
lorries and jeeps. I collect army stuff
as well.      NICKI PEEBLES            </content>
