		<title>05Textiles in the Colne Valley</title>
		<content>    Weaving woollen cloth was an       
 important cottage industry in the     
 Colne Valley. The industrial          
 revolution saw an expansion of        
 textiles in the valley with many large
 mills being built. Many are now       
 closed, but some like John Crowthers  
 still produce woollen cloth.          
    The raw wool at John Crowthers now 
 comes from Australia and New Zealand. 
 The wool is first blended and mixed   
 before being spun into yarn.The yarn  
 is dyed before being woven into cloth.
    Crowthers mill today employ 400    
 people but only 15 years ago provided 
 work for 2000 people. Some of the mill
 buildings are now rented to other     
 businesses outside the textile trade. 
 Crowthers' cloth is sold and made into
 a variety of woollen products.
