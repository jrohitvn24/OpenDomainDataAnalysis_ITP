		<title>17Attitudes to Sheering</title>
		<content> Most people seem to like living in    
{Sheering}and find the village a       
 friendly place. They are especially   
 fond of their houses. They think the  
 village is usually quiet,but they find
 the main street busy  with all the    
 traffic especially between 8 and 9    
 o'clock in the morning and 5 and 6    
 o'clock in the evening. Most people   
 find the village shops useful but do  
 their bulk shopping in{Harlow}or      
{Bishop's Stortford. }One newcomer to  
 the village pointed out the importance
 of owning a car because of the limited
 bus service. Without a car it is      
 difficult for people to visit the     
 theatre or cinema because of the high 
 cost of taxis.If a member of the      
 family is ill it is difficult to go to
 a Doctor's surgery unless you own a   
 car,although other villagers are      
 extremely helpful in times of trouble.</content>
