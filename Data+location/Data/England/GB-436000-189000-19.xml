		<title>19Employment D/W. Grove</title>
		<content> About 120 adults live in Denchworth   
 but the only employment is in farming.
 Villagers, therefore work in the local
 towns, mainly Swindon, Wantage,       
 Harwell, Oxford, while some people    
 travel to London. Grove has 5 main    
 employers. Two are industrial research
 establishments which employ over 600  
 people. Most of the workforce live in 
 Grove itself. There are 2 dairies,    
 processing and selling locally        
 produced milk, and a sewage plant.    
 Grove has a large number of           
 inhabitants who work in the scientific
 establishemnts at Didcot, Harwell and 
 Culham. These are mainly young        
 graduates. There is not a high level  
 of unemployment in either areas, the  
 only incident of industrial unrest was
 in 1983 at the sewage works, part of a
 national campaign.
