 suspicion of outside interference.    
 This applies to diverse groups, such  
 as pro-animal rights factions, who    
 wish to stop hunting or limit the     
 right of commoners to run stock on the
 Forest; or big business, anxious to   
 explore for oil or build profitable   
 houses; or central planners wishing to
 build faster roads.

 criticism comes from the younger, less
 affluent commoner. Working long hours

 peers seek work very actively. He     
 suspects that they manipulate social  
 benefits &amp; the black economy to
