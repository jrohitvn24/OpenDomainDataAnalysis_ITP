		<content> There are many mineshafts in the      
 area,many mapped and some             
 unmapped. Most shafts are{500m deep.  
 The area had to be surveyed to note   
 all of the shafts and aerial          
 photographs were also taken. They     
 found{2,300 shafts}altogether. Some   
 were very dangerous because they were 
 hidden by the trees and shrubbery.    
 Some could not be filled with cement  
 because of the working mine nearby,   
 also because of their depth or the    
 importance of the drainage in the     
 area. Part of the mineshafts were dug 
 out until they hit some solid rock.   
 Some{steel girders}were placed across 
 the shafts. They placed some cement on
 top of the girders and a{large steel  
{mesh cone}was placed on top of that.  
 Some shafts had the{Greater Horseshoe 
{bat}living in them between 15m and 60m
 deep in the mine.                     </content>
