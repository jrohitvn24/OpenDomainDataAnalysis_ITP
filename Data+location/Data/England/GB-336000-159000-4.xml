		<content>    On 31st May 1980 Banwell's first   
 museum was opened by the Banwell      
 Society of Archaeology. It was in a   
 small rented cottage in Church Street.
 It had only two rooms, a small kitchen
 and some space on the landing.        
    Exhibits dated from the Iron Age   
 (flints and pottery from the hill     
 forts), the Romans (coins, jewellry   
 and a mosaic from the villas at       
 Winthill and Riverside),the Middle    
 Ages, and from the last two hundred   
 years. There were displays about the  
 mills, the pond, farming, military    
 uniforms and the fire brigade.        
    The 1983 Easter exhibition was the 
 last time the museum opened as the    
 building was sold. It is hoped that in
 1986 a new museum display will be seen
 in Banwell Fire Station, organised by 
 the Friends of Banwell Fire Station   
 and Museum.                           </content>
