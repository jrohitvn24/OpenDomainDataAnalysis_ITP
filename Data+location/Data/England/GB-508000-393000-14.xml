		<title>14WOMEN'S INSTITUTE CLAXBY</title>
		<content> Although our Institute is small we are
 a very active and friendly group. We  
 meet once a month, except August. Each
 month we have a different speaker on  
 topics of interest, coffee, stalls and
 raffles. Apart from regular meetings  
 we have various outings both          
 educational and pleasure, which       
 include canvas, painting, sewing and  
 flower arranging classes; gliding,    
 walking the countryside, also we      
 attend various festivals and          
 exhibitions. Always there are new     
 opportunities for members to try. We  
 are one of the few institutes which   
 own our own hall, therefore. we have  
 to maintain it. Money is usually      
 raised by coffee mornings and various 
 other events. We go carol singing at  
 Christmas and donate proceeds to a    
 local charity.                        
                                       </content>
