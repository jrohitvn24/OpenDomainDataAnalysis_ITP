		<title>11Names: Chinnor Area</title>
		<content>   Joe Malin was reputed to be the last
 of the Norman family, De Malyn, which 
 lived in the area. Brasses in St      
 Andrew's Church, Chinnor, of 14th and 
 15th Century date, are said to be     
 those of his ancestors.               
   Several names seen in ancient       
 records are still existent; the       
 Croxfords, Witneys and Saws, amongst  
 others, play a full part in Chinnor   
 village life today.                   
 The Civil War in Chinnor and Emmington
   The Manor House at Emmington-said   
 to have been blown up-was the home of 
 John Hampden's family. This area was a
 Roundhead stronghold during the Civil 
 War. Just prior to the Battle of      
 Chalgrove, Prince Rupert sacked       
 Chinnor, burning houses and killing at
 least 50 people. He took 100 prisoners
 and many cattle.
