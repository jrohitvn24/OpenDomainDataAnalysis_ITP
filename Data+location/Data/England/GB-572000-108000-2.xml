		<content>    Until about 150 yrs ago the        
 population was relatively small and   
 largely rural. With the growth of     
{Victorian seaside holidays,}Bexhill   
 became a resort attracting the more   
 affluent visitor. It's still noted for
 it's healthy climate and longevity of 
 inhabitants. It soon became a         
{retirement centre,}predominantly for  
 the monied south Londoner. It's heyday
 was in the 1930s.                     
    The population in 1985 is still    
 largely of{retirement age,}but our    
 block also contains expanding private 
 and council housing on the northern   
 outskirts of town, which attract      
 younger and less affluent families.   
 New industrial estates in nearby      
 Hastings and Eastboure provide some   
 employment. Further{development}of    
 farmland is planned by the end of the 
 century.                              </content>
