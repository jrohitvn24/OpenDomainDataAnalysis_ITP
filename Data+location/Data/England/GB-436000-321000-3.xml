		<content> This 1000 acre park, to the south of  
 Ticknall, provides an ideal setting   
 for Calke Abbey &amp; is owned by the     
 National Trust. The majority of the   
 park is grazing land for sheep,       
 including the rare Portland breed,cows
 and deer.Fallow &amp; red deer are        
 enclosed near the abbey.Roe deer,for  
 which a shelter has been provided, run
 freely. To the north are a chain of   
 ponds which contain rudd, gudgeon &amp;   
 tench. Beyond that the land is rougher
 ground covered with bracken. There are
 many ancient plantations of deciduous 
 woodland &amp; a few conifers. The park   
 became open to the public in October  
 1985. There is one road through the   
 park from Ticknall to Calke and       
 several internal tracks.
