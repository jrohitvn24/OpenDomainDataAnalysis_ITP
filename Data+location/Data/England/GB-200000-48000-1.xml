		<title>01Porthpean area</title>
		<content>   This is an area of undulating       
 countryside which reaches the coast in
 a series of sandy bays interrupting   
 shell and slate cliffs.               
   There were tin mines here,though now
 farming and tourism are the principle 
 activities.                           
   Two roads traverse the district from
 North to South,the B3273,which carries
 most traffic,especially during tourist
 season,follows the wooded valley of   
 the White River.                      
   The second is a minor road used by  
 local traffic.                        
   There are two small hamlets-London  
 Apprentice and Lower Porthpean-though 
 the area is devoted mainly to farming.
 New building is severely restricted.  
 Inhabitants depend upon St.Austell for
 most amenities and jobs.
