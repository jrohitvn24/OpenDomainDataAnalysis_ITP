 miles from Huntingdon and 3 miles     
 north of the main A604 Camridge to    
 Huntingdon road.                      
 It is a fenland edge settlement which 
 stands on a ridge of higher land      
 rising out of the southern edge of    
 the fens.Nearly all the built up area 
 of the village is above the 70ft.     
 contour.The village is sited on       
 Ampthill clay.                        
 In 1969, as with other Cambridgeshire 
 villages, a development plan was      
 produced. Since then, the erection of 
 new housing estates has increased the 
 population rapidly to 2,400.          
 As well as agriculture, there is now  
 work for people on a small industrial 
 estate. Many commute to Cambridge.
