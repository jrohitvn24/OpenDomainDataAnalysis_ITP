		<content> I arise between 7a.m.-7-30a.m.Make a  
 cup of coffee and get breakfast.Pack  
 school lunch for Carl and take him to 
 school 2 miles away in Horncastle.Do  
 any shopping at same time.Back to     
 housework.My day always depends on the
 season.At hay-making time and         
 harvest-time I help by putting the    
 bales on the elevator.There are       
 usually a few trips backwards and     
 forwards fetching my husband from the 
 farm.Lunch is 12-30pm to 1.0pm.I fetch
 Carl from school at 3-15pm.If beasts  
 are going to slaughterhouse I help    
 sort them out and pen-up seperately . 
 Tea is at 5pm.There are usually jobs  
 like gardening or cutting grass to be 
 done after tea.Carl gets ready for bed
 at 7pm.and has a story.I finally relax
 at 8pm.I usually sit and read or knit.
 Bedtime is usually 10-30pm. to 11pm.
