		<title>19Pollution in Fremington Area</title>
		<content> Fremington is on the estuary of the   
 Taw and Torridge rivers. All the      
 people want a cleansing plant for the 
 sewage. There is also an abbatoir on  
 the quay and lots of blood and guts   
 pour out of pipes into the water. Last
 summer and the summer before when it  
 was very hot lots of seabirds died of 
 a virus called Botulism. Silage       
 effluent comes from farms into the    
 estuary and kills the fish. We don't  
 like to swim in the sea because of all
 the muck in it. On 'Watchdog' they    
 said 'the coast around here is so     
 dirty that it's just like bathing in  
 six cups of sewage'. I think the whole
 area around here is messy and needing 
 a good clean up.
