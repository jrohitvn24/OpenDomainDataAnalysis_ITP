		<content> Our area is situated where Wiltshire  
 meets Hampshire; where the broad      
 sweep of Salisbury Plain merges       
 imperceptibly into the wooded hills   
 of the Hampshire basin.               
 The main settlements follow the course
 of the Wallop Brook with an occasional
 outlying farmstead. The village       
 blacksmith has his forge beneath a    
 majestic horse chestnut tree. The     
 houses, many still thatched in the    
 traditional manner of the area,       
 snuggle in the valley.                
 Trout, ducks and moorhens swim in the 
 river where ancient fords still make  
 the easiest crossings.Farming is the  
 main occupation of the people, as it  
 was in the time of the Domesday Book  
 1085 although tractors,not oxen,now   
 pull the ploughs.
