		<title>01  HATFIELD AND DISTRICT</title>
		<content> Our D-block covers the Hatfield &amp;     
 Dunscoft area.Hatfield the largest    
 settlement,is a dormitory village of  
 Doncaster, which is 8-9 miles away.It 
 is mentioned in the original Domesday 
 Book,and for hundreds of years it was 
 like {"an island surrounded by        
{marshland"}.The marsh has been        
 drained, but even so, Hatfield hasn't 
 lost all of its medieval buildings and
 scenery eg,the Manor and church       
 situated next to the High Street.     
 The area is flat and land use is      
 dominated by crops,although earlier   
 use icluded a large royal hunting     
 ground (Hatfield Chase)               
 Coal Mining is a major source of      
 employment in our area,Hatfield Main  
 Colliery being situated on the border 
 of our D-Block.Many people are        
 recovering from the ravages of the    
 longest ever coal strike.(1984-5).    </content>
