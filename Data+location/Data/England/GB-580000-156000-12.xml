		<content> The library has a varied collection of
 books including both fiction and non- 
 fiction titles. The adult section is  
 designed mainly for leisure reading   
 and interest. It also has a small     
 selection of reference books. The     
 children's section caters for all     
 ages. The fiction includes old favour-
 ites like WINNIE THE POOH and MARY    
 POPPINS, while new titles and authors 
 appear all the time. The non-fiction  
 proves a good source of information   
 for homework and hobbies. The library 
 issues about 45000 books a year. It   
 provides a service to the local       
 schools and nurseries which use the   
 library regularly. There is a courier 
 service for elderly members of the    
 village unable to visit the library.
