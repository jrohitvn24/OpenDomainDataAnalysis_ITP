		<content>{A STATE MIDDLE SCHOOL}                
   The headmaster of the{Raleigh School
 has been there for 4 years,during     
 which there have been changes in      
 teaching methods.Practical work and   
{enviromental studies}have increased   
 and there has been growth in tech_    
 nology due to{computers.}There is also
 more oral work although reading and   
 writing are still considered vital.   
   Now 300 pupils attend the school,   
 this figure has decreased over the    
 past decade although it is now rising 
 again.This slight increase is due to  
 the fact that Raleigh is a first and  
 middle school.There has also been a   
 rise in the{birth_rate}and parents may
 choose which school to send their     
 children to.The increase is more or   
 less the same as other schools.       
   The{school hours}are:_8:55 to 3:15.
