		<title>19Ulverston and Albert,France</title>
		<content>   The Ulverston-Albert{twinning       
 started in September 1976 and is cel- 
 ebrating its 10th anniversary this    
 year. The twinning was developed by   
 both Town Councils in order to promote
 better Anglo-French understanding     
 which is now encouraged by annual     
 football competitions,school and choir
 exchanges,and excursions to places of 
 interest in each region. The people   
 who have taken part have made new     
 contacts and developed long-standing  
 friendships and thus achieved a firmer
 understanding of each other.          
   At first the exchange was of an     
 educational nature,but now it has exp-
 anded and involves people from all    
 walks of life. The twinning has made  
 each town more keenly aware of the    
 other's way of life and has developed 
 a stronger bond between them.Ulverston
 hopes it will continue to thrive.     </content>
