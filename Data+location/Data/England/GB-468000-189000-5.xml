		<title>05Old School at Cookley Green</title>
		<content>Until 1985 there was a small village   
school at Cookley Green. Because there 
are so few residents the school only   
had two teachers to teach the age range
of pupils from 5-11 years. The number  
of pupils fell during the last few     
years until there was only one class   
and one teacher.                       
Most of the pupils were children of    
gypsies camping near by; because of    
their nomadic life their level of edu- 
cation was poor. Local people with     
children of school age began to take   
their children away from this school   
and send them to a Primary School in   
Nettlebed, 4 miles distant, objecting  
to the general behaviour of the gipsy  
children. Eventually the school was    
closed because of lack of pupils. The  
old school building is now being con-  
verted into a private house.
