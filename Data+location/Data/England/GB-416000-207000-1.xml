		<title>01Macaroni Downs Farm.</title>
		<content> This is an area of Cotswold farmland, 
 primarily under cereal production, but
 where the fluvio-glacial valleys of   
 the river Leach occur, steeply rolling
 banks of grassland provide dramatic   
 landscapes &amp; grazing usually for      
 sheep. These slopes are beloved by the
 local hunt, lone walkers &amp; winter     
 tobogganers. In the southern portion  
 the scattered copses, primarily of    
 beech, enhance the panorama as well as
 providing good cover for pheasant &amp;   
 partridge. The fields are bounded by  
 dry stone walls which are expensive to
 maintain &amp; no longer stockproof. The  
 farmhouses, cottages &amp; older barns all
 use the local limestone, but recent &amp; 
 probably transient agricultural       
 buildings are constructed with        
 corrugated tin &amp; asbestos roofing.    
 Only three of the five farm houses are
 lived in by farming families.         </content>
