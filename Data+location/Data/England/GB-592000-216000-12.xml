		<title>12LIFESTYLE IN LAYER BRETON</title>
		<content> The village is poorly served by public
 transport and so a car is essential   
 for everyday life. Children of school 
 age have to travel to schools in near-
 by villages, some by school bus. There
 are very few jobs locally and people  
 have to commute to work. Women have to
 travel to Colchester(the nearest town)
 for main shopping, although there are 
 two small shops and a travelling      
 green-grocers for everyday needs. The 
 main recreation centres around 'The   
 Hare and Hounds' pub, but most other  
 activities are linked to Birch, the   
 adjoining village. Breton activities  
 include fishing,horseriding,gardening,
 beagling and television. There is a   
 church service every 3rd Sunday in    
 St.Mary's Anglican Church and Sunday  
 School every Sunday. Although the     
 amenities are few, most people are    
 content with the village as it is.    </content>
