		<title>10The Dane in Shaw Valley</title>
		<content> The old Biddulph Valley Railway runs  
 through this valley.It closed in 1968.
 It is now a bridleway and footpath.It 
 is covered by Sycamore,Silver Birch,  
 Willow and Elder.The damp,shady       
 conditions encourage Nettle,Hogweed,  
 Vetch and Bramble to grow.            
 Dane in Shaw Mill lies empty.It last  
 produced printed towels and fabrics.  
 Brookhouse Lane is an old road from   
 Timbersbrook to Congleton.There is a  
 house called The Limes made of        
 millstone grit  with Lime trees in the
 garden.Brookhouse Farm is a dairy farm
 built of stone.Hoofridge Farm has been
 renovated.The outhouses were made of  
 brick.There was a notice saying 'Dogs 
 kept on lead if seen among sheep      
 liable to be shot'.Opposite to Dane in
 Shaw Mill there was a stream pouring  
 raw sewage into the polluted Dane in  
 Shaw Brook.                           </content>
