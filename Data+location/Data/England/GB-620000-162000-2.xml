		<title>02THE VILLAGE OF HOATH</title>
		<content> Hoath is a small village . It only has
 93 homes including 12 flats for old   
 people . In the middle of the village 
 there is a post office which sells    
 sweets,groceries and household        
 items.Also in the middle of the       
 village there is a church which was   
 built in the 14th century.Next to the 
 church there is Hoath Court Farm which
 has been there over 3 hundred         
 years.They built a village school in  
 1860 and now it is used as a village  
 hall by people for many activities.   
 There is a pub called the Admiral     
 Rodney which is next door to the      
 church. There is a village school     
 which is still being used now in 1985.
 On average the school takes in 6 five 
 year olds each year.This is similar to
 the number of baptisms recorded in    
 Tudor times and shows how little Hoath
 has grown.                            </content>
