		<title>18Harvest customs</title>
		<content> Essentially harvest customs are much  
 the same as they used to be in the way
 that people like to present things to 
 the church which represent harvest.   
 These are still mainly things grown in
 their own gardens and fields like veg,
 fruit etc. but the emphasis has moved 
 away from the corn stocks of old as   
 these are no longer available with    
 combined corn.Even if they no longer  
 attend the local church regulary most 
 residents like to attend the annual   
 harvest service with its cheerful     
 deorations and its familiar hymns.    
 Nearly all the villages also have a   
 harvest supper in conjunction with    
 this festival where the people can    
 meet together over a simple meal      
 provided from the fruits of the earth.
 After the festival there is a         
 distribution of harvest gifts to the  
 elderly of the area who enjoy them.   </content>
