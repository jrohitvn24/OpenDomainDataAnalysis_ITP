		<title>12Westbury Court Gardens</title>
		<content> Westbury Court Garden is unique, it is
 almost the only remaining Dutch water 
 garden in the country. The present    
 entrance is from the A48 road through 
 the two lion topped pillars to the end
 of Court Gardens where, by a car park 
 is the gate embellished by a pair of  
 burogue urns from Ebworth Park and set
 up here in 1983.                      
                                       
 The National Trust accepted the       
 gardens in 1967 in a deplorable state 
 and now in 1985 it has been restored  
 as near to an engraving, recorded     
 around 1705 by Johanes Kip. The road  
 wall and west wall have wrought iron  
 "clairvoyees" inserted so that the    
 enclosure of the garden can been seen 
 from many angles - most especialy from
 those residents who have rooms on the 
 upper floor of the Home.
