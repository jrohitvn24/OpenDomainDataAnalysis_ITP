		<content>    There are two Primary Schools, one 
 in Butleigh, one in Baltonsborough.   
 Butleigh School was built in 1845     
 as a National School. Today there are 
 85 pupils in the age range 5_11 and it
 is mixed. The pupils come from mainly 
 Butleigh but also Butleigh Wooten,    
 Street, Barton St.David, Keinton      
 Mandeville, Baltonsborough, Wedmore   
 (10 miles away) and Glastonbury. There
 are four teachers, one is part time.  
    Baltonsborough School was started  
 in 1850 to cater for 100-125 children.
 There are 78 there now mostly from    
 Baltonsborough, West Pennard, Keinton 
 Mandeville and Barton St.David. There 
 are three teachers and one part timer.
    Both schools get their school      
 lunches from Glastonbury in hot-locks,
 as neither have their own kitchens.
