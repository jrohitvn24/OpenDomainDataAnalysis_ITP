		<content>Throughout Staffordshire during August 
Police Officers and  volunteers        
organise  a scheme called S.P.A.C.E.   
This is a scheme for young people      
between the ages of 10 and 16.         
S.P.A.C.E. stands for Staffordshire    
Police Activity and Community          
Enterprise.                            
Once the young people have registered  
they can join in activities such as    
swimming ,various sports,cinema visits,
discos,rambles,day trips to resorts and
places of interest.In 1984 more than   
25,000 children took part.From our     
school this year 24 children out of    
42 that are eligible have enrolled.    
The scheme was started by the police to
help prevent crime amongst young people
who are bored during the long summer   
holiday.Since the introduction of the  
scheme the level of reported crimes has
fallen each year.                      </content>
