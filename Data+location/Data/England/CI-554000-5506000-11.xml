		<title>11Alderney Week.</title>
		<content> The first week in August is           
 set aside for Alderney Week.Alderney  
 Week is designed both for locals to   
 have fun and to attract tourists in   
 many ways. The local people help as   
 much as they possibly can.They help   
 with games and stalls , organise      
 events and prepare drinks and food,   
 sweets, toffee apples etc.            
   Some of the regular events are _{   
 Miss Alderney,Daft Raft Race ,Safari, 
 Cavalcade,plays,Man_powered           
 Flight,talent show, odd spot          
 competition ,torch light procession,  
 baby show and swimming sports.The     
 tennis courts are open to have a      
 game.There are beach parties. The     
 great thing for the children is Percy 
 Penguin, and the mini-marathon.       
   For one week the variety of events  
 belie the small size of the island's  
 population.                           </content>
