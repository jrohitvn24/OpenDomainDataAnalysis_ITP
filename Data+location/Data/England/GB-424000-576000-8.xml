		<content> Concordia Leisure Centre was built in 
 1977 at a cost of two and a half      
 million pounds, paid for by Blyth     
 Valley Council. It provides           
 opportunities for many activities     
 including various sports, a play      
 group, a sauna and solarium and a     
 leisure pool. It has catering         
 facilities and many people use these  
 to hold events such as parties and    
 wedding receptions.                   
    The results of a questionnaire show
 that:                                 
 a)Most people in the area use the     
 centre at least once a week.          
 b)The facilities are good, but rather 
 expensive, particularly for families. 
    Mr.Tuthill, the manager, would like
 to see a theatre or cinema added at a 
 future date.
