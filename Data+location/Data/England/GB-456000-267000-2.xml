		<title>02The Poplution of Ashby.</title>
		<content>   The population of Ashby ST.Ledgers  
is 110.There are 92 adults and 18      
children.Their numbers by age-group    
are:  Under 5 years old - 6            
      From 5 to 11 years - 7           
      From 11 to 16 years - 5          
   Clearly there are not enough        
children for the village to have its   
own school,so young children have to go
to Welton primary school while older   
ones go to Daventry Comprehensive      
School.                                
   Ashby is a lovely village and most  
of the residents have lived there for  
years - not just two years,but twenty  
years or more.The Kirton family have   
been there for at least four           
generations.                           
   Although there is work for 25 of    
the adults in the village,the others   
have to travel to work in Daventry,or  
even be commuters to Rugby or London.  </content>
