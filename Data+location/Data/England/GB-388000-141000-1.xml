   We live in a rural area.It is mainly
 farmland and is part of the Wylye     
 Valley.  There are some hamlets and a 
 village called Sutton Veny.  In       
 the centre of the village is a church 
 and a school with a large field for   
 playing sports, and an adventure      
 playground by the side.  The hall next
 to the school is shared by the school 
 and the village.  Sutton Veny is      
 mainly a linear village with a        
 population of about seven hundred     
 people.                               
   There are lots of hills surrounding 
 Sutton Veny.  The River Wylye runs    
 nearby, where you can fish for trout. 
 We have quite a few farms in the area 
 and lots of big houses as well as     
 cottages and some new houses.  There  
 is a lot of woodland, one large wood  
 is called Southleigh Woods.           </content>
