		<title>03A DAY IN THE LIFE OF ...</title>
		<content> My name is Tim Mackenzie and I live in
 Tarrant launceston and this is how I  
 usually spend my Saturdays.I get up   
 about 9 o'clock being careful not to  
 wake my brother up who sleeps in the  
 same bedroom.I dont have much for     
 breakfast,usually a cup of coffee and 
 then I go 'rookie hunting'.A rookie is
 a bird scarer,a bit like a firework   
 and they are often lying about the    
 fields I collect as many as I can find
 and then go home for an early lunch I 
 have to change two ponies haynets.We  
 have lots of animals,ducks,hens,goats 
 and dogs.After tea I watch television 
 or I go out in the garden for a game  
 of frisby throwing with my brother.I  
 usually go to bed at 10pm.            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
