		<title>03THE PIER HERNE BAY (part 2)</title>
		<content> unsafe and during violent storms in   
 1978 parts of the pier collapsed.     
 Rebuilding costs were so high that the
 pier seaward of the pavilion was      
 demolished and only the cafe was left 
 as an island, taken over by the       
 seagulls. In 1985 the future of this  
 cafe is undecided. There are two      
 councillors who are governors of      
 Hampton School one of whom thinks that
 the building should have been         
 dismantled and possibly re-erected on 
 the shore, while the other feels that 
 if it were dismantled it would just   
 rot in a council yard. Perhaps a      
 proposed scheme to take tourists to   
 the cafe by boat will be tried but in 
 1985 the building stands as a reminder
 of the length of the World's second   
 longest pier.
