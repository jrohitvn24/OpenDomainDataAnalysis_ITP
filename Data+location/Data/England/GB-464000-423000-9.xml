		<title>09The Village Hall - Carlton</title>
		<content> Carlton Village Hall was built in l956
 and opened by Baroness Beaumont, the  
 mother of the Duke of Norfolk.The main
 area is the hall,with a stage,kitchen 
 and bar.The fund raising events have  
 altered over the years.At first there 
 were Whist Drives,Old Tyme dancing,   
 Drama group and Jumble sales.Now the  
 hall is hired for Discos,Bingo and    
 Weddings,Birthdays and Engagement     
 parties although it is still used for 
 jumble sales.The Village Hall is not  
 run for profit-all the money goes into
 running costs.This is difficult due to
 inflation.The current cost is Â£5/hour 
 plus an extra Â£lO for the bar.All work
 is voluntary.Only the caretaker is    
 paid.The Play-School hire the hall 3  
 times a week at reduced rates and the 
 Senior Citizens are given the hall    
 free on Tuesdays.
