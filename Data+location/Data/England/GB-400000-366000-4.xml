		<content> Last winter there was a landrover     
 stuck down our lane. The snow was one 
 metre deep. We had to put a stone     
 behind the wheel and put some grit on 
 the road. We pushed it. The snow came 
 suddenly and this is how the landrover
 got stuck. Another landrover came and 
 tried to help us. He had a rope in    
 his landrover. Ted hooked it onto his 
 landrover and the other landrover     
 pulled Ted's landrover out. And when  
 he was pulled out Ted unhooked the    
 rope and put it back in the landrover.
 The wind came harder and the snow     
 came harder.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
