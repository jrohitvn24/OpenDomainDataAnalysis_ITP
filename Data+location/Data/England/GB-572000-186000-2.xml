		<title>02St.Michael's Church,Pitsea.</title>
		<content> I think the church is the most        
 important building in the area.The    
 church has a tower which is 16th      
 century.The church is mainly made of  
 large and small grey bricks and most  
 of the church was rebuilt in 1871.Now 
 the church is locked and no services  
 are held.Basildon council have the    
 keys and want to turn it into a       
 museum.                               
 There is a legend that a purple       
 monk hung himself and if you run      
 around the church 3 times backwards he
 will appear.Some people also think the
 church is haunted by a headless nun.  
 Local people call it the"Church on the
 hill",because it is on a hill and it  
 has lovely views.The church has been  
 vandalised and several of the windows 
 are broken,but plants surround the    
 church and ivy grows around part of   
 the church.   By Kirsty Whitelaw.{    </content>
