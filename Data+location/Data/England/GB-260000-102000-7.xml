		<content> Until a few years ago,there used to be
 a{Guy Fawkes Night  Bonfire.}There was
 a big Parade up the hill to the       
 bonfire,which was on the playing      
 field.                                
       A brass band led the way.The    
 people carried flaming torches. At the
 field there was a competition for the 
 best Guy.There was a prize for it,    
 usually a box of fireworks.Then all   
 the Guys were burnt and the fireworks 
 let off.                              
         Hot dogs and soup were sold.  
 It was an exciting night and nearly   
 all the village joined in.            
       It stopped when the people who  
 organized it moved away and nobody    
 else would take it on.                
  The elderly remember a{MAY  QUEEN}on 
 Mayday,but noone does it now.
