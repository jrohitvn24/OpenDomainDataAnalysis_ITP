     This worm farming is the lastest  
thing that has  started in farming.    
It began in the United States of a     
America.These worms are quite amazing, 
because they will eat almost anything. 
They breed with themselves and not with
each other.                            
     The idea of worm farming is to    
help put goodnees into the manure.     
     Most farmers keep them in for a   
while,but now people are building pits 
for them outside.This makes them breed 
more as well.                          
     Worm farming wasn't heard of      
before long ago,but they ar'nt the     
everyday worms.
