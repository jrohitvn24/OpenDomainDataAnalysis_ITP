		<content>   In our rural area of Herefordshire  
 nothing much has changed in the last  
 fifty or a hundred years.             
   The majority of houses are situated 
 in the two villages of Bromsash and   
 Aston Crews and the small hamlet of   
 Ryeford.                              
   There were a lot of farmhouses,we   
 counted 14.The most common type of    
 house was detached and built before   
 1900.There were also a lot of pre 1900
 semi-detached and 7 rows of terraces. 
   Between 1900 and 1945 there was a   
 little building,mainly semi-detached; 
 after 1945 there was a development of 
 26 bungalows on an estate at Bromsash.
   All together in our area we counted 
 153 houses.Of these 77 were pre 1900, 
 43 were pre 1945,and 33 were built    
 since 1945.
