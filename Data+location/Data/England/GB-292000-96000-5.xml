		<content> MR. BRIAN FORDHAM                     
 Brian Fordham is our postman and owner
 of our local shop. He comes round with
 the post whether its raining, snowy or
 sunny.Together with his green van and 
 Postman Pat jumper he gets round on   
 time with the post. If its sunny or   
 dry and warm Brian will come around on
 his bike but the post will still get  
 there on time. Brian's wife is Avril. 
 They have two children called Pippa   
 and Joanne.Pippa and Joanne still go  
 to school, and although they still go 
 to schoolthey help deliver the papers 
 if there are any difficulties.When    
 Brian was a bit younger than he is    
 now,he used to be the royal postman.I 
 am sure that the Parish of Stoke Canon
 is so pleased to have such a nice     
 owner of the local shop.
