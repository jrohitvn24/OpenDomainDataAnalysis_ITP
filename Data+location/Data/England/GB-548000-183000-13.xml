		<title>13MEMORIES FROM THE PAST</title>
		<content> Today Dagenham is very built up area  
 on the outskirts of London. It is very
 industrialised and built-up. It was'nt
 always like this in the past however, 
 Dagenham was'nt always a part of      
 London.                               
 An old resident of Dagenham described 
 it like this:-"In 1925 the Church Elm 
 pub,a little place,beside it was a    
 narrow track,there were no pavements  
 but there was white wooden fencing    
 on either side. Into the distance     
 stretched the open countryside with   
 many old Elm trees and a few old      
 cottages." The resident goes on to say
 that there were only a few shops about
 and also there was the Union Cable    
 works in Chequers Lane which used to  
 sound a siren .                       
 From 1926 onwards many people from    
 London began to move to Dagenham.
