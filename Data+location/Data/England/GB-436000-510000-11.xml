		<title>11PARISH CHURCHES</title>
		<content> This is a small parish church several 
 kilometres by road from the villages  
 of Middleton-St.-George and Middleton 
 One-row,but central to a number of    
 farms and fairly close to Low         
 Middleton village which used to have a
 larger population than now. Before the
 runways of the airport to the north   
 were extended in 1945 people came     
 across the fields from                
 Middleton-St.-George. The church built
 on high ground above the Tees valley  
 is believed to be a pre- Christian    
 worshipping place. The earliest stone 
 work dates from the 13th century. Much
 alteration and extension took place in
 the 18th century. Today a Sunday      
 service is held once a month          
 when,between ten and a hundred people 
 attend.There has been only one wedding
 in the last 10 years and about one    
 funeral and christening each year.    </content>
