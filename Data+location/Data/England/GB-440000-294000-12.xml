		<title>12HOW I SPEND MY DAY</title>
		<content> Today, the 25th June 1985, I got up at
 7.00 am. I fed my fishes and my gerbil
 and went to do some viola practice.For
 breakfast I had 2 slices of bread and 
 a bowl of cornflakes.I did my hair and
 went to school.                       
   At school we sorted out sports day  
 and I have been entered in the 75m    
 sprint. After watching 'Zig Zag' on   
 the T.V. we did our maths and         
 English and went for dinner.I had     
 salad sandwiches and a drink of milk. 
   After dinner we continued with our  
 'castle' project work and tidied our  
 desks for parents evening.            
   After school I went shopping with my
 mum and I bought a new pair of shoes  
 and then went home for dinner.        
   After dinner I played with Tracy.I  
 came back and cleaned out the gerbil  
 cage. Then I had supper and went to   
 bed.                                  </content>
