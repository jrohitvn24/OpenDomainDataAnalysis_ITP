 The school swimming pool was built in 
 1964 in the small play ground.        
 The swimming pool is used regularly in
 the summer term. It has a heater that 
 does not work very well so sometimes  
 the water feels quite cold.           
 Two awards are taught in the pool     
 (grade one and grade two )and the     
 classes take turns in swimming once   
 every day.                            
 There is after school swimming and    
 holiday swimming in the summer. The   
 after-school swimming is held from    
 3.30 to 4.15. The holiday swimming is 
 from 2.30 to 4.30 and the parents take
 turns in organising the swimming and  
 clorination.
