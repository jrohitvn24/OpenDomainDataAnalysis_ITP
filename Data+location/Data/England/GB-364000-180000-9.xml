		<content> St. Michael's church is very old and  
 it is thought that the foundations    
 were put down before the Norman       
 Conquest. In 1983 there was an 'It's a
 Knockout' contest to help raise money 
 for the church bells. Our school took 
 part and came first. A good deal of   
 money was raised and the bells were   
 rehung. This year there was a         
 churchyard festival to help raise     
 money towards the upkeep of the       
 churchyard. Many things went on during
 the week of the festival including    
 guided tours of the church and a      
 demonstration by a stone mason.       
 Children from our school helped by    
 providing work for a display inside   
 the church. We did rubbings of        
 gravestones, drew pictures of the     
 churchyard and wrote poems about our  
 visit to this beautiful old church.
