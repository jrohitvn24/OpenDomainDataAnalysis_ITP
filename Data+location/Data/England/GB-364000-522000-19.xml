		<title>19Neighbouring villages</title>
		<content> Brampton and Crackenthorpe are the on-
 ly other villages in the Long Marton  
 block.                                
    Brampton is about three three miles
 from Long Marton.It is smaller and has
 fewer houses,fewer people,but it has  
 it's own pub,chapel and village store.
 There is a small village where they   
 hold Whist and Domino drives and some-
 times parties.The children are taken  
 by bus to Appleby school.             
    Crackenthorpe is much smaller than 
 brampton and has no pub,store or ch-  
 urch,children who live there are taken
 to Appleby school but there is no oth-
 er bus servise.                       
    Other than the three villages there
 are only scattered farms in the whole 
 of our block.If we put all these tog- 
 ether there would only fill about 1km 
 square.
