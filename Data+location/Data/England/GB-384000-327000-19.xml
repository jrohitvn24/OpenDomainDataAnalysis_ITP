		<title>19CHEBSEY: FARMING SUMMARY</title>
		<content> The area has a fairly even spread of  
 farms mostly between 200 and 300      
 acres.  Many belong to Lord           
 Lichfield's estate but some are       
 privately owned.  Permanent pasture   
 and crop land are in nearly equal     
 proportions with smaller amounts of   
 seeded grassland.  Most of the farms  
 have a strong dairy bias and the      
 cropped land is often for fodder      
 although there are some cash crops,   
 especially barley.  The south western 
 corner is more cultivated than the    
 north eastern corner which tends to   
 have a larger amount of permanent     
 pasture.                              
 Despite the emphasis on dairying, most
 farms could be classified as mixed, as
 they often also keep a number of sheep
 and breeding bulls.
