		<content> What particular likes and dislikes do 
 you or members of your household have 
 about the area in which you live?     
                                       
 These comments were varied.   17 found
 nothing at all to dislike!   8        
 respondents liked aspects of the      
 village life: the atmosphere; rural   
 setting; peace and quiet and the      
 village school.   Others liked the    
 proximity to the coast and large      
 shops, the mild climate and the fact  
 that the area suffers few of the      
 effects of tourism.   Dislikes        
 noticeably included comments about the
 increase in traffic - too much for the
 road conditions in the area.   There  
 was concern about the cuts in         
 government spending while the rates   
 were still high.   The planes from    
 Goodwood were disliked as were the    
 thunderbugs - prolific before harvest!</content>
