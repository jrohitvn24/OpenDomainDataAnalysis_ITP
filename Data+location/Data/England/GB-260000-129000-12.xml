		<title>12Village Changes</title>
		<content>   In many ways the village of         
 Swimbridge has changed tremendously   
 duriny the last century but there is  
 much which has altered little. The    
 greatest changes seem to have occured 
 during the last twenty years.         
   Mrs.{Pam Hutchings}is in her early  
 forties and lives opposite the Jack   
 Russell pub at Bridge View. For many  
 years she was the cleaner-in-charge at
 the local school where she still works
 as a meal-time supervisor. She has    
 seen many changes including the       
 closure of the railway line in 1966   
 and an enormous increase in the volume
 of road traffic although she feels the
 roads have been improved. The tannery 
 has also closed as has the Coach and  
 Houses. The population has changed,   
 she feels, with few of the original   
 families remaining although there are 
 more young families at the moment.    </content>
