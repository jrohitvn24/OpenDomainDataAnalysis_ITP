		<content> Middlezoy County Primary School was   
 opened in February 1875. It is still  
 in the same building, but there have  
 been some additions such as a         
 temporary mobile classroom. In July   
 1985 there were 48 children in the    
 school. The infant children are taught
 by Mrs Crosier and the Junior children
 by the Headteacher, Mr Hamlin. For one
 day a week the juniors are taught by  
 Mr Wannell so that the headteacher can
 deal with the administrative work.    
 The school is built of brick. There   
 are two rooms and the cloakroom in the
 main building. There used to be a     
 house for the head but that has now   
 been converted to make offices for the
 head and the secretary and a  woodwork
 room, a kitchen and a music practice  
 room for the use of children. The     
 school uses the Community Playing     
 Field for sports and games.           </content>
