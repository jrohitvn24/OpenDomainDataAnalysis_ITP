Church Hanborough is now a very small  
village with few facilities.  There is 
the church of St.Peter with a rough    
surfaced area to the east which is a   
car park for the church and for the pub
opposite. In the churchyard there are  
sheep grazing amongst the tombstones.  
The pub on the opposite side of the    
road is called the Hand and Shears     
which recalls the importance of sheep  
farming in the district. Nearby is a   
post box, and a public telephone by    
the bus stop. The bus service goes to  
Witney, Woodstock and Oxford, but we   
looked at the timetable and the best   
description of the service would be    
"infrequent". We sat on a bench which  
had been placed there in 1977 to       
celebrate the Silver Jubilee of Queen  
Elizabeth II.
