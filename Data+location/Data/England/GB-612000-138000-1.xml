 This area is situated midway between  
 Ashford &amp; Folkestone &amp; is mostly      
 devoted to farming. The area is most  
 pleasing to the eye with fertile      
 farmland in undulating countryside on 
 the edge of the North Downs and with  
 small scattered communities dotted    
 along the narrow winding lanes. Old   
 and established oak,beech &amp; ash trees 
 in hedgerows &amp; woodland give beautiful
 scenes.                               
 The public have access to the grassy  
 slopes of the Downs by the ancient    
 Pilgrims Way &amp; the North Downs Way,   
 which cross the whole district in a   
 south easterly direction.The area is  
 rich in small springs;it has also the 
 source of the East Stour,which rises  
 from several spout holes near the     
 twelfth century church at Postling.   </content>
