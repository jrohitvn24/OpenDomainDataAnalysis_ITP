		<title>12Education In Tolworth</title>
		<content> I go to Tolworth Girls School. It is a
 school for girls between the ages of  
 11 to 18.The uniform is navy          
 blue.Rules about the uniform are very 
 strict.The girls come from:Tolworth,  
 Chessington,Kingston,Worcester        
 Park.Nearby is a boys school called   
 Southborough.Fleetwood and Hollyfield 
 are the two mixed schools.There are   
 also some privat schools(fee paying   
 schools)such as Surbiton High Girls   
 school.There are many junior          
 schools:e.g St. Andrews and           
 St.Marks,St. Pauls,St. Matthews and   
 Malden Manor.Children,to get placed in
 a secondary school are tested when    
 they are in their last year of Junior 
 school. This test is called the       
 "eleven plus". If you pass this you go
 to either of the two selective        
 schools: Tiffin Boys or Tiffin Girls.
