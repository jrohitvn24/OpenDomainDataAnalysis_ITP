		<content> The average age of the local          
 population is quite high, but the     
 people are very healthy. Our          
 researchers have found that many      
 people produce their own vegetables,  
 make their own bread and take plenty  
 of exercise. Doctors, dentists and    
 opticians have practices in Ledbury,  
 but some people are registered with a 
 doctors' practice at Staunton, both   
 places are some four miles away.      
 There are two rest homes, one at      
 Eastnor at Bircham's Grange, which was
 previously a children's home, and one 
 at Bromesberrow called the Laurels.   
 Bircham's Grange has 17 residents aged
 between 70 and 95, the Laurels has 20 
 residents with 16 over 70. All        
 patients receive regular visits from  
 their families. Both homes offer good 
 facilities for their residents, many  
 of whom had interesting hobbies.      </content>
