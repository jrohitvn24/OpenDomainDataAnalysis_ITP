		<content>    This block takes in the city centre
 and most of the inner-city residential
 areas.The focal point used to be the  
 Market Square,the shops being grouped 
 round it and along streets radiating  
 from it.The Victoria and Broadmarsh   
 Centres have taken trade away from the
 central area,resulting in shops       
 standing empty or changing hands.     
   The Council is promoting tourism.The
 Square is being refurbished and       
 buildings cleaned externally.Many     
 streets have been closed to traffic to
 improve the environment.              
   The area is multiracial including   
 West Indians,Pakistanis and Indians.  
   Housing varies from Victorian       
 terraces to new council estates and   
 includes the Victoria Centre flats and
 the Park private estate.              
   The Lace Market produces world-     
 famous Nottingham Lace.               </content>
