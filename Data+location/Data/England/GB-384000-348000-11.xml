		<content>  Wolstanton police station closed in  
1965 because Newcastle station was     
bigger,and they decideed to run        
operatioom there.Policing is done by   
area constables,and by car patrols.    
Northern patrol officers do the traffic
duties.The police stations 118 men and 
women include 2 dog handlers,and  18   
C.I.D.officers.Sometimes police        
officers come into school to talk to us
about road safety or not talking to    
strangers.Next term they are going to  
come in and show us how the police     
work.There will be a police-car and    
radios and uniforms to try on.They are 
going to take our fingerprints,but we  
will be able to take them home         
afterwards.Apoliceman also comes into  
school every year to test the children 
who have been doing cycling            
proficiency.
