		<content>   Much Hadham is a fine example of a  
 roadside settlement. It is a long     
 straggling village lying along the    
 shallow valley of a small stream named
 the Ash. The valley is about one km   
 wide, and on either side low hills    
 rise, somewhat sharply in places, to a
 flat stretch of tableland. The stream 
 winds through water meadows, creating 
 some water-cress beds and good        
 pasture.                              
   The main road runs North-South      
 straight along the valley linking Ware
 and Bishop's Stortford, and in bygone 
 days there was a single line railway  
 which followed a similar route through
 the village, linking Buntingford and  
 St. Margaret's, but this line was     
 closed in the 1960's as part of Dr.   
 Beeching's railway strategy.
