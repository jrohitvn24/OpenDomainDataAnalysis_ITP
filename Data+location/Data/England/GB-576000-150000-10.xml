		<title>10BOUGHTON AND VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content> The name Boughton Monchelsea derives  
 from the Anglo-Saxon 'Bocton', meaning
 'clearing in a beech wood', and the   
 name 'Montchensies', from the Norman  
 family who owned the estate in the    
 12th century.                         
 The village hall was built in 1978,   
 the result of a great deal of local   
 effort, time and money. It stands on  
 the edge of the village playing field 
 and is used for many different        
 activities. Various sports clubs use  
 it: football, cricket, netball, squash
 and badminton. A playgroup operates on
 Monday and Thursday mornings, and     
 Scouts, Cubs, Guides and Brownies also
 meet here. In the evenings there are  
 Parish Council meetings, Beetle Drives
 and the occasional dance, play or     
 other entertainment. The hall has     
 shower facilities, a stage, a kitchen 
 and a small committee room.           </content>
