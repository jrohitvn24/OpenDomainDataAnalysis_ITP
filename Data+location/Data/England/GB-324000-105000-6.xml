		<title>06FARMING STOCKLAND/COTLEIGH.</title>
		<content> Mostly dairy farming and beef.One     
 farmer breeds Arab strain horses and  
 has a flock of Jacob sheep.Winter     
 sheep population is greater as farmers
 in the Midlands send flocks for winter
 grazing.Most are cross bred.Cattle    
 feed crops and some corn are grown.   
 Farms are very mechanized,usually run 
 by one man with his sons.The last     
 horse powered farming died out in the 
 sixties.There are two annual grass    
 crops,mostly silage with some hay.    
 Milking cows are Friesan but Hereford 
 bulls are favoured being gentler.Very 
 little hand milking.Straw for bedding 
 comes largely from the Midlands.Rare  
 breeds are bred on a small scale.A    
 goat farm sells the milk and          
 cheese.There are some pigs,some are   
 Landrace cross.Most farmers keep free 
 range  hens.Some cider is made.Ducks  
 geese and turkeys kept seasonally.    </content>
