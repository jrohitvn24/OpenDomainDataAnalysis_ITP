		<title>12  THE SALING OAK</title>
		<content>   The Saling Oak is on the A120. The  
 original Saling Oak used to be across 
 the road that leads to Stebbing Green 
 before is was knocked down and rebuilt
 on the opposite side of the road. The 
 Saling Oak used simply to be called   
 The Oak but there was a pub with the  
 same name in Braintree and many of the
 customers got confused. Therefore Mr. 
 and Mrs. Tarrington , the present     
 owners , changed the name. There have 
 been eight previous owners. Their     
 regular customers come mostly from    
 Rayne , Felsted and Dunmow. They      
 don't get any truly local trade       
 because there aren't any villages     
 with in walking distance. There is    
 also a cafe , called the Diner , which
 lots of passing traffic uses. This is 
 a major source of income helping to   
 keep the pub going.
