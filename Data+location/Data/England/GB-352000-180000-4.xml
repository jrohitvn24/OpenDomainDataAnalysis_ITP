		<content> Of the small number of residents in   
 the area only about half are of em-   
 ployment age. The majority work in    
 farming and very few are employed by  
 the chemical works. The large number  
 of people employed by the industry    
 and in the trading estates come from  
 outside this area.                    
 ENERGY                                
 Electricity is supplied by the South  
 West Electricity Board and the large  
 number of pylons stretching through   
 Severnside connect to the Berkeley    
 Power Station. South West Gas has a   
 non-working site in this area and is a
 branch of British Gas which pipes and 
 stores natural gas through the village
 of Hallen. There are also petrol      
 storage tanks and a pumping station in
 the vicinity.
