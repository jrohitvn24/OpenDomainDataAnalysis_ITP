		<title>01General Review - Strensall</title>
		<content> Our block consists of four major      
 elements.  These are the{growing      
{village of Strensall, the Army camp,  
 the edge of{Strensall Common}and the  
 surrounding{farms}with the{River Foss 
 winding its way through the           
 countryside.  A great deal of new     
 housing with few additional amenities 
 has appeared in the last ten years.   
 This growth will continue for at least
 five more years.  The Depot, the      
 King's Division is used for training  
 purposes and Strensall Common is      
 M.O.D. property with some access to   
 the general population.  Strensall has
 a{great many new people}due to the    
 camp and new housing.  A major problem
 at this time is trying to integrate   
 everyone into a community.  Property  
 changes hands quite quickly and the   
 soldiers families change at least     
 every two years.                      </content>
