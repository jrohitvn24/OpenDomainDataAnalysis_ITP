		<content>   This farm is a{general farm,}       
 covering 40 hectares.  There are 80   
 beef cattle which are Hereford cross  
 Friesian and one{house cow}from which 
 the farmer and his wife get their     
 milk. There is also an old family     
 horse and two geese.                  
   The farm produces potatoes, hops,   
 grass, wheat and barley.  The farmer  
 has specialised equipment for potatoe 
 growing, including planters and       
 harvesters.  The usual rotation is 4  
 years of arable crops and then 4 years
 of ley.  The cattle are fed on raw    
 barley as well as silage in the       
 winter.                               
   The farm is a family farm.  The     
 farmer and his old father worked it   
 together.  The family had been on the 
 farm for 50 years.  The farm is not   
 typical of its neighbourhood.
