		<content>      {HYLAND PARK}is a public park.   
 It is open from sunrise to sunset.    
 It has its own football pitch, cricket
 pitch, 4 tennis courts, a pavilion and
 toilets.   It has three entrances.    
      There are many different trees   
 all the way round.   It has swings and
 slides.   Lots of children play there.
 People walk their dogs there. It is a 
 good place for watching birds and for 
 getting away from traffic.            
      We saw greenfinches, wood pigeon,
 a hooded crow, mistle thrush, dunnock,
 house sparrow, starling, blackbird and
 a lapwing.                            
     {HARROW LODGE PARK}has a boating  
 lake, playground, criket pavilion,    
 tennis courts, swimming pool and an   
 old manor house called Harrow Lodge.  
 There are four entrances.   We saw    
 ducks, swans, dogs and cats.   There  
 was a little playground with swings.  </content>
