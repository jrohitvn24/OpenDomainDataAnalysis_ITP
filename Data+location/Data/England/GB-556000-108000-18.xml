		<title>18HAILSHAM SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Hailsham School is a Comprehensive and
 is usually called "Battle Road"       
 because it is in Battle Road! It      
 is a very big school. There are       
 about 1,500 children and 90 teachers. 
 At our Primary School we have the     
 same teacher for most of the day      
 but they go to different classes for  
 each lesson. The children have a break
 time for a quarter of an hour at 10.00
 and an hours lunch time at 12.00. Mr  
 Quinn is the headmaster.              
   Battle Road has a Drama Studio,     
 Science block, Maths block and lots   
 more facilities. It has three halls, a
 dinner hall, and an assembly hall.    
 Battle road has a big library and a   
 studying room for those who want to   
 study quietly.                        
  They do all sorts of sports there,   
 and have many out of school clubs.
