		<title>07SCHOOL BELL RINGS AGAIN.</title>
		<content>   On Thursday,September 5,1985 at     
 9 o'clock,when we came to school,the  
 mums did not go home, because the bell
 was going to be rung for the first    
 time in many many years.              
   It had to be repaired because a long
 long time ago two brothers stuffed the
 bell with cow dung so it would not    
 work.The boys were my friend's Grandad
 and Great Uncle.                      
   One of the Dads mended the bell but 
 our teacher is not too sure if the mud
 they found in the bell was the same   
 cow dung.                             
   We invited our parents,the governors
 of the school and friends to a service
 to bless the bell and we made up a    
 poem about the bell.We also added our 
 own verse the the hymn,we sang,       
 "Give me chime in my bell,keep me     
 ringing."
