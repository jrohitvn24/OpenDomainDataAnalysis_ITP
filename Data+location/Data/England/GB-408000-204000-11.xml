		<title>11BIBURY CHURCH AND CHAPEL</title>
		<content> The church today, like many village   
 churches, is not used to the extent   
 that it was fifty years ago, apart    
 from baptisms, weddings and funerals. 
 It is very popular with visitors for  
 its Saxon and Norman arcitecture and  
 the beautiful rose trees lining the   
 paths. The priest in charge lives in  
 Bibury, and serves Bibury, Winson and 
 Barnsley churches. There is mainly    
 only one service on Sundays but there 
 is a small but happy Sunday School.   
 The Baptist Chapel is in Arlington    
 near the Green. There is no longer a  
 resident clergyman but regular Sunday 
 services and women's meetings are     
 held. The people who lead these groups
 and these services are from outside   
 the village.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
