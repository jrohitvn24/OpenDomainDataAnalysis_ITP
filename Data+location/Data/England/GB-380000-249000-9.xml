		<content>  Although the area is crossed by 3    
 major communications routes,there     
 remains poor access for the public.   
 a) The Worcester - Malvern railway is 
 rumoured for closure by B R. The      
 nearest stations are Malvern Link and 
 Foregate Street, Worcester.           
 b) The main A449 Worcester - Malvern  
 road has been greatly improved during 
 the past 20 yrs. It was marked as a 3 
 lane road,but it was changed back to 2
 lanes after numerous accidents. It    
 carries many thousand vehicles more   
 each day than it was designed for.    
  The new bridge across the R. Severn, 
 2km to the NE was opened in 1984 and  
 has improved access to the M5,reducing
 delays for through traffic.           
 c) The B4424 Upton Rd from Powick     
 roundabout is busiest in June,on the  
 3 days of The 3 Counties Show,near    
 Malvern Wells.                        </content>
