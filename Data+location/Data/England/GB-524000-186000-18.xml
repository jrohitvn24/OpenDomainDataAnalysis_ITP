		<content> Children's opinions of Golders Green: 
 "It has big roads which are very      
 dangerous."                           
 "We have very big litter problems in  
 Golders Green. People think it is a   
 dustbin. It is full of old cigarettes,
 cans, food and lots of rubbish."      
 "There are plenty of old age homes and
 guest houses around the area."        
 "There are plenty of accidents in     
 Golders Green because people drive too
 fast and double park."                
 "People like the name of Golders      
 Green. It makes people want to live   
 there because it sounds so glorious." 
 "In Golders Green you cannot really go
 for a walk as there are few nice      
 places."                              
 "Golders Green is mostly a Jewish     
 community but still there are plenty  
 of other people."
