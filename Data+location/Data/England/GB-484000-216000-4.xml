		<content>     The old church rooms were used for
the infants school from 1877-1918.  The
infants were then transfered to the    
community centre which was then the    
school.  There were three teachers Mr. 
stubbs, his wife and Mrs.Rickard.      
     In 1974 a new school had been     
completed at the other end of the      
village.  There were many more teachers
employed and the population of the     
school started to expand               
     The school won several            
competitions, but the most remembered  
was when a class 1 pupil won a         
nationwide computer competition in his 
age group.  For the prize the school   
recieved some computer equipment to    
the value of 3500 pounds.              
     The school has also done well in  
athletics and swimming galas.
