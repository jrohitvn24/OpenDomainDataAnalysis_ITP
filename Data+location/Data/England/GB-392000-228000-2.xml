		<title>02Court Farm, Bishops Cleeve</title>
		<content>     Court Farm is a farm of 300 acres 
 (124 hectares), and marks the western 
 edge of the parish of Bishops Cleeve. 
 It is a long narrow farm bordered to  
 the west by the main line railway     
 between Birmingham and Bristol.       
{The farmer and his family:            
{    } The farmer is Fred Knight. His  
 wife Vera and two sons Raymond and    
 Peter work full time on the farm.     
 Raymond married to Denise has a son   
 Simon aged one year whom he hopes will
 one day follow the family tradition on
 the farm. Raymond is particularly     
 interested in animal husbandry, and it
 was his wish after studying           
 agriculture at Hartpury College to    
 change the farm from beef to milk     
 production.
