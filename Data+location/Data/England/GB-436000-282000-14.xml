		<title>14kYLIE THOMPSON'S DAY 1985</title>
		<content> I get up in the morning between 7.00  
 and 7.30,wash and get dressed.Then I  
 make breakfast for my brother and     
 myself-usually toasted cheese and     
 cherryade.After breakfast I play with 
 my dogs,Gemma and Bodie before leaving
 for school at about 8.30.At school the
 first lesson is English,then assembly 
 then playtime.After play is Maths-I   
 enjoy that. I go home for my dinner   
 and have something like bacon,fried   
 bread and fried potatoes.I go back to 
 school at 12.30 and we start at 1.00  
 with project and then do P.E.When I go
 home at 3.15 I watch television until 
 5.15 then have my tea(usually a salad 
 or something).After that I play(maybe 
 two-ball or something like that) then 
 I watch television again until 10.00. 
 I read for about 30 mins until its    
 bedtime at 10.45.
