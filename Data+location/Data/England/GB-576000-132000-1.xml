		<title>01BENENDEN WEALD, INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content>   Benenden Weald is a rural area lying
 between the settlements of Cranbrook, 
 Hawkhurst, Benenden and Iden Green.   
 Settlement is in the form of scattered
 farm houses, many dating back to well 
 before Tudor times, one of which we   
 studied. Some of its few amenities are
 connected with education for leisure, 
 such as its two riding schools and    
 Swattenden Field Centre. We chose to  
 spend much of our time studying Forest
 Farm, particularly the changes which  
 have taken place under the present    
 owner, as this fitted in very well    
 with our sixth-form geography course. 
 The pleasant landscape of the High    
 Weald provided us with several pages. 
 We selected the name because of its   
 connection with school and the        
 generally wooded nature of the land.  
 Local people were unable to provide us
 with a better one.                    </content>
