		<title>19EASTON WEIR</title>
		<content> Easton is a small village outside     
 Huntingdon with a population of       
 approximately two hundred people. It  
 is a very old site with a lot of      
 history behind it.                    
  There is an old weir there which is  
 now filled with sewage.Once it had    
 pure water in it,and when the Black   
 Death came to Easton from the         
 neighbouring village of Grafham clean 
 water was very rare. People came from 
 all around to drink the water, so a   
 cobbled path was built leading down to
 the weir.                             
  The wier is used for dumping rubbish,
 and it is black with rotting leaves.  
 it is marshy and boggy, and no attempt
 has been made to clear it up, although
 it has so much history behind it.
