		<title>11Wheatley Hill Fire Station</title>
		<content>    The Fire Station was built in 1955.
 At the time it was built it had one   
 fire engine and this was welcomed by  
 the community for the security it     
 provided. Before this a fire engine   
 had to travel ten miles to the fire.  
    The only addition since 1955 has   
 been the provision of an extra        
 appliance. The large doors needed to  
 be altered because the new engine was 
 too high.                             
   {Sixteen men}work at the station    
 working shifts to give round the clock
 protection.                           
    There are{eleven rooms}including   
 the drying room, engine room, watch   
 room and officer-in-charge room.      
    When asked about improvements the  
 men said that they would like more new
 equipment, especially a training tower
 to help with their practice.
