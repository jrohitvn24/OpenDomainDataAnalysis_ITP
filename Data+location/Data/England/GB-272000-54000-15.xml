		<content> The Devonshire {Dialect} is a         
 complicated one to speak, but sadly   
 the accent is disappearing from our   
 language because people are coming    
 down from Scotland and other Counties 
 and bringing their own {accents} into 
 the area. So now it is mainly the old 
 who speak with a Devonshire accent.   
 Some of the  young people  do speak   
 with a true Devonshire accent because 
 they come from families with strong   
 accents. The people who are true      
 Devonians speak the Dialect in the    
 true way. Many words are different and
 not easily understood. Every effort is
 being made to make sure we  keep our  
 dialect by the formation of           
 Devonshire Dialect {Societies.}
