		<title>20The Wreck off Sheerness</title>
		<content>       The{wreck}of the American       
 Liberty ship, the Richard Montgomery, 
 containing unexploded bombs, lies in  
 the Thames Estuary just to the north  
 of Sheerness.                         
       Built in 1943 in Florida it     
 dragged its anchorage and sank on the 
 Nore Sands on the 20th August 1944    
 during a storm. The sands broke the   
 back of the{ship}snapping the hull in 
 half. Next day only the tips of the   
 masts were showing. Its contents were 
 3691 U.S.tons of aerial fragmentation 
 bombs for use in{World War 2.}        
       Today the ship's masts are still
 visible from Sheerness and it remains 
 a constant hazard to the thousands of 
 merchant ships which{transport}goods  
 along the Thames.                     
      It is thought that if the bombs  
 were to explode the town of Sheerness 
 would be destroyed.                   </content>
