		<title>07Industry In Our Area.</title>
		<content> Up until the last war the cotton      
 indusry dominated life in our area.   
 Over the next two decades there was a 
 massive decline in this industry due  
 mainly to cheaper imported cotton     
 goods from overseas.Many mills closed 
 down and there was much unemployment. 
 The famous saying 'England's bread    
 hangs on Lancashire's thread' no      
 longer was true.                      
        Some former mills, previously  
 engaged in cotton, are now producing  
 other things e.g.jute, industrial     
 containers,or employed in light       
 engineering.                          
     One firm, Fothergill and Harvey,  
 did not close down.Fortunately for our
 area they had seen the light-and      
 diversified.This firm is so important 
 to our area-we visited it to find out 
 what they produce and why they        
 survived.                             </content>
