		<content>    The Queen Elizabeth Training       
 College is the biggest residential    
 college for the disabled in Britain.  
 It is owned by the Queen Elizabeths   
 Foundation for the disabled, and is   
 used to train the disabled to do a job
 most suited to them. Their patron is  
 the Queen Mother. She visited the     
 college in 1970 and again in 1984.    
 Every disability except total         
 blindness is accepted here and the    
 disabled are trained individually.    
 The courses available include Business
 Studies and typing.The college,       
 situated in several acres of grounds, 
 is beautifully kept by the gardening  
 students. Their course lasts for a    
 year because gardeners need to know   
 how plants grow in each season. The   
 college can take up to 330 students at
 any one time, and having been trained 
 most students find jobs.              </content>
