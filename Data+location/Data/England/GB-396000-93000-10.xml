		<content> It is Sunday afternoon and I am       
 looking out of my sitting room window 
 my mum opens the window so I can hear 
 all the sounds. The wind is rustling  
 the leaves on the trees and the bushes
 and the grass is swaying from side to 
 side. I can see a bee taking pollen   
 from a flower. I can hear the drone of
 traffic on the main road. All the     
 bungalows along the road are painted  
 different colours. I can see cars     
 parked on driveways behind brightly   
 coloured gates. The sky is blue with  
 white clouds drifting about. It looks 
 like rain as same of the clouds are   
 darker than others. There are red,pink
 and white roses in my garden. My mum  
 weeds the borders while dad cuts the  
 grass.There is a lamp post outside our
 gate. The light shines into my mum's  
 bedroom at night.
