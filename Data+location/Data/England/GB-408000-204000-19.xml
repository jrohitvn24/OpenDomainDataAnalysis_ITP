		<title>19TOURISM IN BIBURY</title>
		<content> Local people feel that tourists  are a
 mixed blessing. If they treat the     
 countryside with care by taking litter
 home,respecting privacy and parking   
 considerately, tourists are welcome   
 but not if they walk on the roads and 
 fields when footpaths are available.  
 Tourists help support trade and       
 employment in local shops, hotels, and
 other attractions.                    
        A survey conducted recentlty   
 by the village children found that    
 nearly 40% came from neighbouring     
 counties.About 14% were from overseas,
 particularly from U.S.A. The majority 
 came by car and parked by the river.  
 Most had been before and were         
 returning for further visits.About 60%
 had visited the troutfarm and from    
 this it was estimated that about      
 100,000 people visit Bibury each year.
