		<title>01DESCRIPTION OF BLOCK.</title>
		<content>The block is situated in Lancashire in 
agion called "the Fylde". As the       
derivation of the name suggests it is  
mainly composed of fields.             
  To the north of the block are the    
outskirts of the village of Wrea Green 
and the southerly edge of the old      
cotton and flax spinning town of       
Kirkham. The main A583 Preston to      
Blackpool trunk road passes through    
this section.                          
  To the south of the block is the     
northerly edge of the village of       
Freckleton which at one time was a     
thriving port on the River Ribble. The 
main A584 Preston to Lytham St.Annes   
trunk road passes through this         
section..                              
  The remainder of the block abounds   
with typical fields except for Kirkham 
Open Prison situated on the Freckleton 
Road.                                  </content>
