		<title>13NATURE TRAIL, SOUTHWELL (2)</title>
		<content> To the east, was Kirkilington Station,
 similar to Farnsfield, but wothout a  
 warehouse.  There is now a car park   
 and picnic area in the yard.  Over a  
 cutting are two bridges, one of which 
 used to carry Nottingham Corporation's
 water supply.  This now runs          
 underground.                          
   About a mile further east, is       
 Maythorne crossing.  A crossing next  
 to the bridge had to be made because  
 the bridge was too low for high farm  
 loads.                                
   The old Southwell level crossing    
 marks the end of the trail.  There is 
 the old Greet Lily Mill - flour used  
 to be produced here by grinding.  It  
 was owned by the Booth and then the   
 Cauldwell families.  The Newcastle    
 Arms public house here was set up for 
 passengers on the railway.
