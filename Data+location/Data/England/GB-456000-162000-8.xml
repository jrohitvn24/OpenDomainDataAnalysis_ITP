		<title>08HOUSING AROUND TADLEY</title>
		<content> Outside Tadley and Baughurst the      
 survey area is sparsely populated. A  
 small council estate in Brimpton and  
 the hamlet of Brimpton Common are the 
 only 'major centres of population'.   
 Every size and shape of house from the
 mansion to one bedroom bungalows are  
 represented, however. Apart from the  
 council houses and ten farm workers   
 houses all the houses are owner       
 occupied and very expensive. A few    
 small cottages, costing in 1985       
 Â£50-60,000 still exist but mainly they
 are the larger, modern five bed, three
 bath types or 'three-knocked-into-one'
 cottages, with prices starting around 
 Â£100,000. This is a very desirable    
 area in house agents jargon. People   
 are generally concerned about the     
 possibility of urban sprawl spreading 
 into the country, they tend not to    
 want more facilities locally.         </content>
