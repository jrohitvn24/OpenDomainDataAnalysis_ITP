		<title>13DERBYSHIRE HILL FARMING 1.</title>
		<content>   A typical Derbyshire hill farm rears
 calves for meat and sheep for both    
 meat and wool.                        
   At one local farm, the hardy        
 Gritstone sheep live out during the   
 winter months with extra feed during  
 bad weather. Most of the flock lamb in
 April or May, although a few are      
 brought in early to lamb.             
   Shearing is done in mid-June, when  
 the fleece must be completely dry.    
   It is compulsory to dip sheep twice 
 each year, in August and October,     
 against scab and other skin pests.    
   Some of the lambs and older ewes are
 sold at the end of August at local    
 markets e.g. Bakewell and Hartington. 
   The native Gritstone sheep are bred 
 for their good quality fleece and for 
 meat, whilst a Swaledale/Suffolk cross
 is bred mainly for its meat.
