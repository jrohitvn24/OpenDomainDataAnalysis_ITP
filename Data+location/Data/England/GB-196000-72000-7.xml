		<content> Since the new sewerage system has been
 installed the building embargo on     
 houses , shops and offices has been   
 lifted. This has led to the building  
 of several new shops in an arcade off{
{The Platt}and{Polmorla Road}. The     
 shops are small and include a fruit   
 shop, delicatessan, jewellers, shoe   
 repairers and an auction room and art 
 gallery. There is a restaurant and    
 take away food shop, antiques, health 
 foods and a high class butchers       
 selling venison, partridge, quail,    
 salmon and trout.                     
 There is an attractive wind vane over 
 the entrance on{The Platt}which is in 
 the form of a golden camel. The camel 
 disappeared one night and then was    
 mysteriosly returned. The second phase
 of the development is now under       
 construction and will include an area 
 for outdoor theatre .                 </content>
