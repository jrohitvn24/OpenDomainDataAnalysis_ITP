		<content>  We interviewed two ladies who have   
 lived here for a long time.When they  
 first lived here it was not so nearly 
 as built up as it is now.The first    
 estate was built about 24 years ago   
 and the next one about 15 years ago.  
 There was a big outcry when the       
 estates where planned.Some poultry    
 farms were knocked down.It also meant 
 a lot more cars were introduced to the
 area.                                 
 Longmoor Lake,now California Country  
 park,was bought in 1935 and made into 
 a holiday camp which took in coach    
 loads of children from London every   
 day.The facilities included a zoo     
 ,boats,a miniture railway and speedway
 racing every weekend.There was also a 
 pavilion in which dances took         
 place.The pavilion was burnt down 15  
 years ago and the Council bought the  
 camp and turned it into a country park</content>
