		<title>11Batley Feast</title>
		<content>  The feast (fair) comes to Batley     
 twice a year.It is held at the Branch 
 Road Site,next to the bus station.    
  There are a lot of things to do at   
 the feast.There are space             
 invaders,bandits,hot dog stalls,      
 shooting galleries,etc.You get lots of
 chances to win prizes like soft toys, 
 mugs and goldfish.                    
  There are lots of rides at the feast.
 My favourite is the dodgems-where you 
 can ride around bumping into other    
 cars.I don't like the waltzer,it makes
 me feel sick.                         
  The feast usually stays for about a  
 week.I usually go down at night with  
 my friends.After it has finished at   
 Batley,the feast moves on to another  
 site in another town.
