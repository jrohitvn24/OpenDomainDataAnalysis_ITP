		<title>10BURWELL LEARNER POOL</title>
		<content> A new swimming pool is going to be    
 built near the Village College site   
 because an existing school with a pool
 is closing and so one is required.The 
{Swimming Pool Committee}is organising 
 the fund raising.                     
 The Chairman of the Committee said    
 there has been no opposition to the   
 idea although if they had gone for a  
 really ambitious pool costing Â£60,000 
 they may well have had some.The       
 smaller{splash pool}will be 5 metres  
 by 7 metres  by 0.9 metres and the    
{big pool}will be 15 metres by 7 metres
 by 1.4 metres.The big pool will take  
 130,500 litres or 29,000 gallons.The  
 splash pool will take 27,000 litres or
 6,000 gallons.The pool will be{used in
{the summer months}by the scool,clubs  
 and the public.Families can also book 
 it privately.                         
 It should be{ready}for{summer of 1985.</content>
