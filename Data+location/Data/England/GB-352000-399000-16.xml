		<title>16A DAY AT NUGENT HOUSE</title>
		<content>  At 7.30a.m.I get up and air the beds.
 We wash and dress in school uniform,  
 it is grey with black and red tie.It  
 is then breakfast, cereal, toast and  
 coffee.We eat it all because there is 
 nothing else to eat until 12.00 lunch.
 Then back to house units to make beds,
 they all have continental quilts. We  
 each have a set job, if it is not done
 properly I can't go out for playtime. 
 My job is to tidy the common room,    
 others are cleaning toilets and       
 hoovering.At playtime we play on B.M.X
 on the fields or playground.Assembly  
 is 9.15 to 9.30, then it is the       
 dreadful time when lessons start      
 english and math before lunch, after  
 it is science,history, geography,     
 and crafts. At 4p.m.house parents take
 us back to the unit where we change   
 and have tea,then homework.Activities 
 are electronics and modelling,bed 9pm </content>
