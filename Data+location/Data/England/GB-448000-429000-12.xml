                     It is dedicated to
{St.Wilfrid}(Bishop of Ripon) and      
{St.Mary,}and built of locally quarried
 limestone.Between 1889 to 1891 the    
{Hemsworth}family gave money for the   
 Church to be restored,and put in      
 stained glass windows.

{Monk Fryston Chapel. }                
                     Methodism has been
 in Monk Fryston since{1808,}but the   
 present building was not begun until  
 1845 with money provided by a local   
 family called Roadhouse.The original  
 shape was{hexagonal.}In 1875 it was   
 too small for all the members and so a
 rectangular end was added.With        
 dwindling numbers part of it has been 
 closed off for a number of years      
 until  this year when renovations have
 been done.                            </content>
