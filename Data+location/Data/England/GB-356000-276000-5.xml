		<content>     We asked people in our block      
 about their eating habits.            
     More people have cereal than      
 cooked breakfast.We think that because
 a lot of people have to go to work    
 very early,they only have time for    
 a drink and biscuit.Toast was quite   
 popular because it's warm and  doesn't
 take long to prepare.                 
     Most people have their main meal  
 in the evening because a lot of people
 go to work.Many people have their     
 main meal at lunch time because a lot 
 of men work on farms near to where    
 they live. Most people have{3 meals}a 
 day they are probaly breakfast,lunch  
 and tea.A few people have{4 meals}a   
 day probably they count supper        
 in.Nobody has more than{4 meals }a day
 and nobody has less than {1 meal}a    
 day. Many people have{only            
{2 meals.}                             </content>
