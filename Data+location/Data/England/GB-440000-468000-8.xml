		<title>08MY HOUSE - AN OLD ONE.</title>
		<content>    My house was built in 1748.   It   
 has pantiles on the roof not          
 slate,and is built by a farmer who    
 kept horses and cows. It had 11       
 rooms                                 
 when it was built but will have 14    
 when we finish it. They kept it warm  
 by open coal fires, but we are having 
 central heating which burns oil.   It 
 is two storeys high at the front but  
 is single storey at the back.   There 
 is a long garden at the back with old 
 fruit trees at the bottom.   The house
 has been altered many times in the    
 last 237 years.
