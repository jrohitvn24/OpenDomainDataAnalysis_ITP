		<title>13Transport around Brafferton</title>
		<content>    The area surrounding the A167 is   
 well served by{public transport.}There
 are some 6 services passing along the 
 road that provide a bus every 10      
 minutes. However Brafferton itself    
 lies about a mile from the main road  
 and has only 1 service on an hourly   
 basis. This service is erratic and the
 elderly residents of the village in   
 particular complain of the            
 inconvenience.                        
                                       
    For farmers and other locals,      
{private transport}is essential        
 especially where there are children to
 be taken to school or to the main road
 for the school bus.                   
                                       
    There is also a{mainline railway   
{ line}(but no station) in the area    
 which is on the London to Scotland    
 route.                                </content>
