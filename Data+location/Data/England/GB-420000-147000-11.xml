		<title>11EMPLOYMENT IN TIDWORTH</title>
		<content>  The Ministry of Defence is the main  
 employer of people in the Tidworth    
 area. Soldiers form the greater part  
 with civilians employed by the Civil  
 Service as clerks,drivers or cleaners.
 Civilians also work in the Officers'  
 Messes and in the retail trade,shops, 
 garages,cafes and pubs. Many school   
 leavers find it difficult to get a job
 and some have to travel to larger     
 towns,Andover or Salisbury,to find    
 employment. A small number of men work
 on the land for local farmers. A      
 number of service wives work locally  
 and endeavour is always being made to 
 introduce new trade and employment    
 opportunities. A careers service is   
 run at Ordnance House for school      
 leavers and the Army run resettlement 
 courses for officers and soldiers     
 leaving the service. Plans are in hand
 to attract light industry to Tidworth.</content>
