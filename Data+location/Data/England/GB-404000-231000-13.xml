		<title>13Kingstone Minerals Quarry</title>
		<content> The quarry has been operating for     
 about 70 years and is owned by        
{Kingstone Minerals Ltd.}25 people,    
 including a manager and weighbridge   
 operator, are employed. The quarry    
 totals about 55 acres in area,        
 including a new field of 23 acres.    
 They start quarrying the new field by 
 first taking off the topsoil. The     
 second layer is hardcore, the third is
 used as walling stone which is a      
 creamy white colour. The fourth layer 
 is used as building stone for houses  
 or it is crushed for making concrete  
 slabs and roadways. The building stone
 is cut into manageable pieces and     
 taken into a barn to be cut to size by
 a clipper saw. There it is cut into   
 brick-like pieces for house building. 
 The lime is the waste from the crushed
 stone which is put through a mill and 
 ground into dust.                     </content>
