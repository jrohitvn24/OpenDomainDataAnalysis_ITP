		<title>07EAST MERSEA OYSTER FISHERY</title>
		<content>   The oyster fishery is run as a joint
 venture with one in Scotland.The      
 oysters are bred there and then       
 cleaned,purified and salted in East   
 Mersea.Two different types of oyster, 
 the Native and Pacific are cultivated.
 Some 90 tonnes or about 10800 oysters 
 are sold annually. All of the oysters 
 are sold alive. The most important    
 market is London.Other shellfish are  
 kept in tanks as the market is growing
   At present twenty people are        
 employed,most live in Brightlingsea   
 and come to work by boat.The owners   
 would like to build a restaurant and  
 car park on the site of the fishery   
 but the development is controversial. 
 When planning permission was          
 originally granted it was agreed there
 would be no further commercialisation 
 in this area of Special Scientific    
 Interest.                             </content>
