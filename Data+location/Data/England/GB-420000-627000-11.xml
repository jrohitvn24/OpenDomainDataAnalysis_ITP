		<title>11VILLAGE LIFE</title>
		<content> If one is willing to participate in   
 village life,( see text 7) life can be
 busy and active.                      
 A good community spirit here.         
 Large proportion of residents over    
 60's,mainly retired business people,  
 friendly,a good social mix,a relaxed  
 pace of life.                         
 Very little crime.                    
 Disadvantages - Large section of the  
 community is ageing.                  
 People with no car face a long journey
 for hospital appointments or visits.  
 No doctor, no school,no police in     
 village, buses infrequent.            
 Young people have to move away for    
 work &amp; houses.                        
 More Council Houses needed to provide 
 influx of younger people as houses    
 here too expensive for 1st time       
 buyers.
