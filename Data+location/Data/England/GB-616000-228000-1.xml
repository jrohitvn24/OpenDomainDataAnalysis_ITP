		<content> OUR SURVEY AREA CONTAINS PARTS OF     
 THE SMALL VILLAGES OF WIX AND WRABNESS
 IN NORTH EAST ESSEX.THE REMAINDER OF  
 THE AREA IS FARM LAND MAINLY UNDER    
 CULTIVATION FOR CEREAL AND VEGETABLE  
 CROPS WITH A LITTLE GRASSLAND. THE    
 LAND BELONGS TO ABOUT TWENTY FARMERS. 
 SOME RENT THEIR LAND FROM THE COUNTY  
 COUNCIL,OTHERS HAVE OWNED THEIR LAND  
 FOR GENERATIONS AND SOME IS OWNED BY  
 LARGE COMPANIES  BASED ELSEWHERE IN   
 ESSEX.THE MAIN ROAD  FROM COLCHESTER  
 TO HARWICH CARRIES  HEAVY GOODS       
 TRAFFIC AND TOURIST  TRAFFIC THROUGH  
 OUR AREA. IN THE EARLY 1970'S A NEW   
 BY-PASS WAS CONSTRUCTED TO EASE       
 CONGESTION IN WIX. EMPLOYMENT IN THE  
 AREA IS BASED MAINLY IN AGRICULTURE,  
 THE PORT OF HARWICH AND IN LOCAL      
 SERVICE INDUSTRIES IN NEARBY TOWNS    
 SUCH AS IPSWICH,COLCHESTER AND        
 CLACTON-ON-SEA.                       </content>
