		<title>07Torquay Museum-Local History</title>
		<content> In 1844 eighteen Torquay men got      
 together because they liked history,  
 and formed The Torquay Natural History
 Society.They kept on getting more and 
 more artefacts so they decided to     
 build a museum to keep them in.Torquay
 Museum was built in 1874 near Lisburne
 Square.Robert Sheddon built the museum
 which took two years to build.The     
 Museum has many photographic          
 plates,flowers,insect collections and 
 geological and archaeological         
 specimins.There is a mummified child  
 which was aged between 6 and 8.People 
 used to believe if you put them in a  
 tomb they would rise from the dead.A  
 display shows that the earth was      
 formed 4,600 million years ago.First  
 came shellfish and then fish 450      
 million years ago.Some of the         
 artefacts come from Kents Cavern.The  
 Museum arranges lectures and walks.   </content>
