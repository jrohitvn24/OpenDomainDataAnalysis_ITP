		<title>17SUPERNATURAL IN LINTON</title>
		<content>   There are not many people in Linton 
 who know much about ghosts and haunted
 houses,but we did get a few stories.  
 Here is a list of the haunted places  
 and their ghosts.Richmond's House-a   
 headless horseman,a house on Linton   
 High Street-two figures,Queen's House-
 Robert Webbe,13 High Street-a hooded  
 lady(possibly the virgin Mary).       
   Quite a few people in Linton are    
 superstitous.One lady in Linton said  
 she was superstitous. Here are some of
 the superstitions she knew-do not put 
 an umbrella up in the house,do not    
 walk under a ladder.                  
   A house in Linton was being         
 modernized and in one of the walls a  
 jar of coloured thread was found.The  
 story emerged that when the house was 
 being built the jar of thread was put 
 into the wall of the house to protect 
 it against witches.                   </content>
