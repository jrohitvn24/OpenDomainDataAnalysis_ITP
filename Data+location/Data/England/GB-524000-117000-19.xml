		<content> Further information from the "Evening 
 Argus" (Brighton), w/c 14th October   
 1985.                                 
  Millionaire Hickstead owner Douglas  
 Bunn is making a bid for a cut in the 
 Â£18,000 rates bill for his famous     
 jumping course. He believes he has a  
 strong case for reduction because of  
 fewer meetings are now held. Hickstead
 has fought to keep its prices down for
 the public. 20 years ago a ticket cost
 Â£1, it is now Â£2. Mr. Bunn said,      
 "Tickets would be Â£6 each now if they 
 were linked to inflation."  Mr. Bunn  
 added that the rate application had   
 nothing to do with the proposed change
 to the A23 next to the ground. Two    
 years ago, meetings at the course,    
 which attracted the world's best      
 riders, were cut from four to three to
 save on costs                         
                                       </content>
