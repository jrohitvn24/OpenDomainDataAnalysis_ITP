		<content> In 1940 during the war, a Royal       
 Ordnance Factory was built on the     
 outskirts of Liverpool near the       
 village of Kirkby. It was dispersed   
 over a wide area and made ammunition  
 detonators.                           
 In April 1946 the factory site was    
 handed over to Liverpool Corporation  
 to develop as an industrial estate.   
 The town of Kirkby was built as an    
 overspill centre for people being     
 rehoused from clearance areas in      
 central Liverpool and as a home for   
 employees of the rapidly expanding and
 thiving industrial estate.            
 The estate's area was 380 hectares and
 in 1959 over 27,000 people were       
 employed in a multitude of firms      
 engaged in the manufacture of a       
 tremendous variety of domestic, light 
 and heavy engineering and food        
 products. {                           </content>
