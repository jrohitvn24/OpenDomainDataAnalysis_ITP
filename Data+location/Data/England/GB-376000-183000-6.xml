		<title>06HORTON CHURCH CHOIR</title>
		<content>    A few weeks ago I joined Horton    
 church choir.We go to practice at the 
 Rectory on Friday nights. We sing     
 hymns and psalms,which are sometimes  
 too fast for me.On Sunday I go to     
 church at 10.30a.m. At the back of the
 church there are curtains.I go behind 
 them and get out my red cloak and hat 
 and white sleeves and collar and put  
 them on. When the other girls and boy 
 arrive the Rector says a prayer. Then 
 we open the curtains, sing a verse and
 walk up to the choir seats. The Rector
 says prayers and reads out of the     
 Bible, and we sing psalms and hymns.  
 We use a big book for the hymns,and   
 the book of Common Prayer for the     
 psalms and prayers.When the Rector    
 goes into the pulpit we move to the   
 front seats.We open our Bibles and he 
 talks about it. I like singing the    
 hymns and saying prayers. Kellyrose   </content>
