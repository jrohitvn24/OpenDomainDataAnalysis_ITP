		<content>  {RELIGIOUS ASPECTS IN OWSTON         
  The parish of Owston, which is       
 combined with Withcote, shares a      
 Church of England vicar with four     
 other parishes. He lives at           
 Tilton_on_the_Hill and is appointed by
 the Bishop of Leicester.Three services
 a month are held in St.Andrew's Church
 Owston. Three families in the village 
 are Roman Catholic and go to Oakham;  
 the village is regularly visited by   
 Jehovah's Witnesses.                  
  The churchyard is maintained by two  
 villagers who mow regularly and keep  
 it tidy. The church is cleaned by     
 ladies of the congregation who work on
 a rota system. They arrange the       
 flowers and at Christmas, Easter,     
 Harvest and any other festival they   
 all combine to decorate. The organ is 
 played by young people of the Parish. 
 Weddings are solemnised in the church.</content>
