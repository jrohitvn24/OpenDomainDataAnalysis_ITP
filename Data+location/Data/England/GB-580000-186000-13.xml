 football,tennis,French cricket,netball

 touch. Some children have games       
 on their home computers or video games
 for their T.V.sets.                   
  For{French skipping}you need a long  
 piece of elastic knotted into a       
 circle. 3 or more people may play. Two
 players stand one each end with the   
 elastic around their ankles. Then the 
 third player jumps in and out chanting
 a rhyme, such as "England,Ireland,    
 Scotland,Wales.In-bobble,Out-bobble,om
 pom poufay".If she succeeds in jumping
 the elastic it is raised higher until 
 she is out. To play{marbles,}you roll 
 them along a drain cover in the play- 
 ground,obeying certain rules.         </content>
