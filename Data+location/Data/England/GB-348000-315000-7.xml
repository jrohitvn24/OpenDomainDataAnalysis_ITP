		<content>   Battlefield Church was built on the 
 site of the Battle of Shrewsbury.     
   The actual building was constructed 
 on the site of the burial pit where   
 many hundreds of men were put into a  
 mass grave.                           
   The church was a chantry church     
 where priests were employed to say    
 prayers for those who died in the     
 Battle.                               
   It is built in the Perpendicular    
 Style and has had restoration added   
 during 1985.                          
   Inside there are the Coats of Arms  
 of those great nobles who fought in   
 the Battle of Shrewsbury including the
 Kings of England.                     
   There is also a pieta of the Virgin 
 Mary holding the dead Christ, it is   
 said to be older than the church      
 itself. The Corbet Family have        
 associations with the Church.         </content>
