		<content> Following work done by 1st.Year       
 Humanities last year,one of the local 
 studies was urban geography.O-S maps  
 obtained from the Technical Offices   
 were 'scaled up' in order that groups 
 of children might identify house types
 and building materials.This was       
 considered important since local      
 roadswere an extension of the Nash    
 Estates built as part of the new      
 Collier Row in 1938 and keeping to    
 much the same style of building of    
 building until 1948.                  
                                       
 Children observed that with increased 
 interest in D.I.Y. many tenants were  
 changing the exterior fabric of their 
 houses and building extensions.
