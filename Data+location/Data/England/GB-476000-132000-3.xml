 which is called Blackmoor Church of   
 England Primary School.The school is  
 church aided and the Reverend R.J.    
 Inkpen comes and teaches us about the 
 church.Blackmoor School was built in  
 1962 to replace the old school which  
 was in Village Hall.There are four    
 classrooms in the main building and   
 two in a temporary one. There         
 are plans for a new room to be built  
 onto the main building which will     
 house the library,video,computer      
 and television.A porch is also going  
 to be built onto the entrance.In      
 each class there is a teacher and     
 30-35 children.Mrs Kuchemann teaches  
 the 4-5 year olds in class one.Mrs    
 Holland teaches the 5-6 year olds in  
 class two.Miss Gray teaches the 6-7   
 year olds in class three.  By Hilary
