		<content> There are only 2 activity centres,    
 Sutton Barton Country Club and Umborne
 Village Hall.There is no public house.
 The village hall is used for bingo,   
 farm produce,poultry &amp; meat are prizes
 There is an active WI concerts, dances
 &amp; jumble sales are regularly held.Over
 the years funds have been mounting for
 a new village hall. Until recently    
 local children used to swim in the    
 summer in the 'pool' a specially dug  
 out deeper part of the Umborne Brook. 
 A new pool in Honiton has caused a    
 cessation of this activity. The Young 
 Farmers Club at Honiton and Axminster 
 appeal to teenagers who engage in raft
 building for the Axe River race &amp; make
 floats for the local carnival season. 
 Sutton Barton appeals to the younger  
 element with its pub like activities  
 of darts, pooletc, whilst the retired 
 people support the village hall.      </content>
