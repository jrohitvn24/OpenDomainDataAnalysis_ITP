		<content>{Lady Foxwell,}whose country house is  
 on the fringe of Sherston, has, by her
 many connections with the Entertain_  
 ment Industry, provided the village   
 with a steady supply of{well known    
{"personalities" for their Carnival}day
 festivities.                          
    Famous actors, actresses and       
 pop_stars have appeared to crown the  
 Carnival Queen and to take part in the
 day's activities,{at no expense to the
{village}(and this when appearance fees
 begin at Â£250).  The suspense of      
 wondering who will come to join the   
 colourful and sophisticated house     
 parties of dancers and singers of     
{international fame}provide a focus of 
 interest which adds greatly to the    
 crowd pulling appeal of the Carnival &amp;
 is a talking point for the village for
 many weeks afterwards.
