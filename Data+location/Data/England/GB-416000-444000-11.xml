		<content> The River Wharfe flows through the    
 Wharfe valley, and is surrounded by a 
 flood plain. North of the river is    
 Weston park, a large wooded area, and 
 a part of Otley, called Newall. South 
 of the river is another part of Otley 
 called Westbourne. West of Otley is   
 another town called Burley. The       
 highest point of the land is Beacon   
 Hill which is 232 metres high. It is  
 situated on the West Chevin, a hill   
 South of Otley. The main roads in the 
 area are, the  A660 from Otley to     
 Burley and the A65, which runs from   
 Burley, going South East towards      
 Menston. Another main road is the     
 A6039, going North East from Menston  
 to Otley.The is good farmland and     
 there are about 19 farms in the area. 
 There is now one railway in the area  
 as the Otley station was closed down  
 in the sixties.                       </content>
