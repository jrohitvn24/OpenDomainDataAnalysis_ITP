		<title>14A nice place to live</title>

   We have written whether we like     
 living in Whitchurch or not.Here is   
 one piece of work about this.         
   Whirchurch is the third place that I
 have lived in,most of the people who  
 live here are very friendly.They      
 usually say Hello and have a chat when
 you meet them in the street.          
   The shops are altogether in the     
 centre of the town.The International  
 Store is a kind of small supermarket  
 where you can go when you haven't much
 food shopping to do.For the big weekly
 shop we go to Andover.                
   The Hangings is a nice piece of     
 countryside,it is called this because 
 the trees overhang the path you walk  
 on.The countryside around is very     
 peaceful and there's hardly any       
 litter.                               
                                       </content>
