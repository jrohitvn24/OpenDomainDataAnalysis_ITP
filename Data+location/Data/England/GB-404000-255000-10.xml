		<title>10 Cookhill Priory (cont.)</title>
		<content>  The farm covers an area of 100 acres 
which includes a Gazebo and an army    
burial ground.The army burial ground is
a mound surrounded by a ditch and the  
Gazebo is a summer house where the     
monks who occupied the Priory would    
spend their Sunday afteroons as a kind 
of holiday.There is also a sundial     
which has been part of the Priory ever 
since it was built. Hidden in the ivy  
surrounding the house is a silver bell 
which dates from 1619 A.D.On the bell  
is written "William Fortescue August   
9th Anno 1619." This shows that it was 
the personal property of the Fortescue 
family.In the south west corner of the 
garden is a garden house which dates   
from the 17th century.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
