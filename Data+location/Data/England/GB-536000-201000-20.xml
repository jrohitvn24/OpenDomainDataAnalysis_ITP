		<title>20Why Live in Cheshunt?</title>
		<content>Many families moved to Cheshunt        
because they wanted a larger house     
than they could afford in London.They  
had relatives living in the Cheshunt   
area and also found it a more peaceful 
relaxed environment than in London.    
Cheshunt is also convenient for those  
who travel to work in London as there  
is a frequent train service and a good 
road system.                           
There are many recreational activities 
in the area for all age groups to      
enjoy.These include:fishing in the     
River Lea and in the disused gravel    
pits;tennis,squash,horseriding,swimming
football,cricket,BMX riding and        
trainspotting.
