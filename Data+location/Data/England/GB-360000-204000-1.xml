		<content> Within the boundary of the Royal      
 Forest of Dean some people claim the  
 right of Common,to graze sheep on the 
 open forest known locally as Commoners
 rights.they are called in local       
 dialect "Sheep Badgers".It is thought 
 that this claim dates back to Norman  
 times,when local landowners on the    
 forest edges were allowed to graze    
 animals on the forest in compensation 
 for damage done by the Kings deer.    
 Grazing is not allowed in the enclosed
 forest. There are 10 "sheep badgers"  
 in this area running about 800 sheep. 
 Many road accidents are caused by     
 wandering sheep.                      
 Local people may claim the right of   
 Pannage ie: to turn loose on the open 
 forest, pigs to eat the acorns during 
 the Autumn months.
