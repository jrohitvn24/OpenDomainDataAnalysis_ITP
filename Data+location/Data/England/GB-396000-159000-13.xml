 other half of the team had slithered! 
 We were fortunate that the boat had a 
 rope by which we could haul it up     
 these difficult slopes.               
    The boats stood up well to the     
 battering they received unlike their  
 crews who suffered a variety of       
 injuries.  These ranged from nettle   
 stings and minor cuts to a broken arm 
 and two cases of hypothermia.         
    My team reached the semi-finals.   
 We felt that we were unlucky not to   
 reach the final, but we were          
 disqualified because a crew member    
 fell out of the boat!
