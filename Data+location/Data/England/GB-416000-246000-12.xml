		<title>12TRANSPORT:          QUINTON</title>
		<content>   The only{public transport}to visit  
 Quinton is a{bus service}running      
 between{Stratford}and Chipping        
 Campden. This operates infrequently.  
   On Tuesdays there is a private bus  
 to Moreton in Marsh market.           
  {Older children,}most of whom attend 
 Shipston on Stour High School, are    
 carried by a local authority hired    
{school bus.                           
   The army does provide some extra    
 buses for soldiers and their families.
   Although some people are able to    
 travel quite widely by bicycle, most  
 village dwellers seem to rely on      
{family cars for local transport.      
   There are a number of older         
 inhabitants who rarely travel beyond  
 the village.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
