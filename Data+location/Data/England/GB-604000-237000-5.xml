		<content>The railway line between Capel         
and Hadleigh was closed in 1966.Since  
then Babergh district council have     
allowed the line to develop as a nature
walk.It is therefore a good example of 
controlled ecological succession.The   
walk cuts across farmland,in some parts
high above the neighbouring fields.The 
central path has not become overgrown  
because it has a solid base of stone   
andnd  clinker with little soil to     
support young seedlings and it is      
used frequently by people exercising   
their dogs.                            
Along the edges of the line Hawthorn,  
Hazel,Blackthorn,Oak,Field maple and   
Elder trees have developed             
unrestrained.In some parts these have  
grown across the path to form a canopy.
This has allowed shade loving plants   
such as lesser celandine,herb bennet   
and wood anemone to develop.           </content>
