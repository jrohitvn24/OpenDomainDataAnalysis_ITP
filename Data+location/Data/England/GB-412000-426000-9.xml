		<title>09PEOPLE IN WYKE - JACK (POEM)</title>
		<content> Jack is old and frail.                
 His back bent forward,                
 And his head facing the pavement,     
 He walks down the street.             
 Laying his hand upon a lamp post      
 To rest his fragile body.             
 It begins to rain.                    
 Jack feels cold,                      
 So he makes his way home              
 Slowly!                               
 When he finally reaches his house,    
 He digs deep into a pocket for the    
   door key.                           
 Jack steps inside his dull and lonely 
   home                                
 And sits back in his chair            
 Tired and sleepy.                     
 He has had his day out for this week. 
 Now he'll go back into his own world.
