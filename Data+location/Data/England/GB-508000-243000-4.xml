		<content> It is noticeable that the fields in   
 this area are reasonably small by     
 todays standards.  The hedges are well
 kept, thick and well managed which    
 helps to provide shelter for small    
 mammals and birds.  In some of the    
 fields small copses have been allowed 
 to remain; farmers have ploughed      
 around them.  These areas again afford
 shelter to the wildlife. However, one 
 can still find evidence of the dutch  
 elm plague which invaded a few years  
 ago.  Several skeleton trees remain   
 standing today.  Many footpaths and   
 bridleways criss-cross over this land,
 both across fields and through the    
 woods.  These paths afford their users
 beautiful walks with lovely views and 
 an abundance of flora and fauna to    
 enjoy.
