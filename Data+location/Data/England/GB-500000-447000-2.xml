 The village is dominated by the Hall, 
 standing to the west of the main

 street, is the parish church of St.   
 Margaret. There is also a small       
 Methodist chapel in the village.

 situated on the premises of P.H.      
 Sissons &amp; Sons, Joiners and           
 Undertakers.                          
 Housing comprises the Hall, 3 farm    
 houses, 10 council houses (some now   
 privately owned), 6 older detached    
 houses and 6 cottages. There are also 
 3 new detached properties, 2 of which 
 are not yet completed.                </content>
