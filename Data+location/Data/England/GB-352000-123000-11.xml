		<title>11The Podi Plod</title>
		<content>   This route for{joggers}is near where
 I live. Every day people from the Air 
 Base jog around this{three mile       
 course.It starts at the Base,then goes
 down the road to Podimore.Then you    
 turn right and follow the road to     
 Stockwitch Cross,then right again and 
 you're back at the Base.              
   Every morning before I go to school 
 I see about ten people jogging around 
 it at irregular intervals and more    
 people jog around it during the day.  
   My house is about halfway round so  
 usually the joggers are still brisk   
 when they get to Podimore.Some fat    
 people are puffing though,especially  
 on hot days.One man who was jogging   
 was wearing Union Jack shorts and he  
 looked ridiculous.In the summer most  
 men don't wear shirts,only shorts for 
 jogging.Sometimes they stop for a     
 drink at the Podimore Inn. ANNA HILL. </content>
