		<title>09 CHILDREN'S GAMES - CALNE</title>
		<content> There are different kinds of marbles. 
 When I lived in Chippenham they called
 a "gosher" a "gobber", and they called
 a "king kong" a "German gobber". When 
 we play marbles the aim is to roll    
 your marble to hit your opponents     
 marble. If you hit it you win their   
 marble.Only two people play.You should
 play on a flat surface, the school    
 playground is best. I play on the lawn
 at home. It is not a good idea to play
 by a drain.There are different rules  
 in Calne from Chippenham. There is a  
 rule here called "levelsies" which    
 means if the marble is in a position  
 round a corner and the opponent cannot
 hit it  he can win the marble by      
 taking his marble level with the other
 and then rolling it.Another rule which
 many people think is not fair is      
 called "Nearly levels". You can level 
 your marble close to the opponents.   </content>
