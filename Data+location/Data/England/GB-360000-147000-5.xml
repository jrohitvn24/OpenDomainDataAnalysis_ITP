		<title>05GURNEY SLADE QUARRY</title>
		<content> With the increase in road building    
 from the begining of the 20th.century 
 there was an increase in the demand   
 for roadstone and three quarries      
 opened in Gurney Slade to help        
 meet it. Stone used to be transported 
 from Binegar Station, but the quarries
 eventually closed, as did the railway.
 Now there is only one quarry remaining
 in operation in the village. Once     
 known as Francis Flowers Lime Works,  
 it was originally used to provide     
 stone for lime-burning. The remains of
 the old lime kilns can still be seen  
 among the new quarry buildings by the 
 roadside. However in 1962 it was      
 bought by Mr. Perry of Morrris and    
 Perry and since then has been quarried
 for road stone and cement products    
 which are crushed on site. At present 
 some 50 acres are actively used for   
 the extraction of stone.              </content>
