		<title>18Transport in Elsworth</title>
		<content> There is no daily bus service from the
 village and so a car is needed for    
 work. There are buses on certain days 
 to Cambridge, Huntingdon and St. Ives 
 which makes it possible to use public 
 transport for shopping. The services  
 are provided by Whippet Coaches of    
 Fenstanton.                           
                                       
 The lack of transport makes it        
 particularly difficult for young      
 people going to work and so most have 
 motor bikes. The County Council       
 provides transport for Junior children
 coming into Elsworth and for secondary
 children attending Swavesey Village   
 College.                              
                                       
 It would be difficult to live in      
 Elsworth without a car, and this      
 presents problems for old or poor     
 people.                               </content>
