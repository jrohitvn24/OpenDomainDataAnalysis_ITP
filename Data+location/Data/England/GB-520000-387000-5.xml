		<content> Idyllic area set deep in countryside  
 on opposite bank of River Bain to     
 Girsby. Wykeham Hall is Victorian on  
 site of earlier Jacobean House, in    
 Parkland overlooking lake made only 30
 years ago in bog area and stocked with
 trout for private fishing. Near the   
 Hall are remains of small Church dem_ 
 olished in 17th C but still with 2    
 memorial tablets and vaults below     
 said to have been looted by troops    
 billeted there in W.W.2. Still signs  
 of early settlements at West &amp; East   
 Wykeham, decimated by Black Death     
 Plague in 14th C. Today 14 adults &amp; 7 
 children live here, all in Estate     
 property. In addition to the Hall with
 a self contained flat retained by the 
 owners, there are 9 houses, 2 being   
 empty, 5 occupied by employees and 2  
 by people working elsewhere.
