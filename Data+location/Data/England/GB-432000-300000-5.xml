 only exists in 1985 the Anglican      
 Church. The main church of the        
 ecclesiastical parish is All Saints   
 Sheepy Magna but there is a chapelry  
 at Ratcliffe Culey. In Sheepy there is
 a good childrens' Sunday School with  
 an age range between 5 and 12 years   
 and attendance is about 30.Church     
 membership in Sheepy is about 50. Men 
 and women both hold responsible posts 
 in the church though not in the       
 ordained ministry.There is one        
 ordained rector and he is responsible 
 for the churches of Sheepy Magna,     
 Ratcliffe Culey and Sibson.           
 Other religions are catered for       
 outside the area for example in       
 Atherstone 3 miles away.
