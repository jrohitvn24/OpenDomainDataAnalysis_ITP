		<content> Titchfield Haven Nature Reserve.      
 The Haven is run by the National Trust
 and has a permanent warden who lives  
 nearby.                               
 The grounds cover about 280 acres.The 
 River Meon runs through it and the    
 area is very marshy.                  
 The Reserve is open to the public from
 late August til March by appointment  
 with the warden.The reserve is closed 
 during the summer so as not to disturb
 the birds in the breeding season.     
 In the winter up to 3000 ducks visit  
 the Haven.Redwings and ducks visit in 
 January,February and March on their   
 way from Africa to Scandinavia.       
 The Warden also traps and rings birds 
 for identification.The rings have a   
 number and British Museum printed on  
 them. There are a number of hides on  
 the site to watch the birds from as   
 ducks are very nervous birds.         </content>
