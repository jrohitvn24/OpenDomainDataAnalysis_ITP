 When people use water,it becomes      
 dirty.When it flows down the drain,it 
 becomes the business of the treatment 
 plant to re-cycle it.The plant first  
 removes rubbish from the water by     
 using screens,which are metal bars    
 placed close together.When the rubbish
 has been removed the water is put into
 large tanks called clarifiers;there   
 the solids settle to the bottom and is
 called crude sludge.The clarifier     
 makes it cleaner by adding coagulant. 
 Chlorine is then added which destroys 
 bacteria.Sulphur dioxide is added to  
 reduce the chlorine.When the water is 
 clean it is put into a service        
 reservoir from where it is taken to be
 used or put back into the water cycle.
 Water consumption in 1972 was 225     
 liters per head per day,and this      
 figure is still rising.               </content>
