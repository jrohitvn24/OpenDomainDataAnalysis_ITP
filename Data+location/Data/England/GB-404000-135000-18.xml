		<title>18Population,Wishford area.</title>
		<content> The last census in the area was held  
 in 1981 and the population was        
 recorded as Stapleford 260, and Great 
 Wishford 328 people.                  
   The population of Little Langford is
 recorded as part of the population of 
 The Langfords and together the total  
 is 526 people.                        
   In all the villages in the area     
 there is a common trend, the majority 
 of people tend to be of the older     
 generation. The younger people move to
 the towns to find jobs, while retired 
 people move into the quiet of the     
 villages. In particular long serving  
 officers on retirement from military  
 garrisons in nearby areas have chosen 
 to settle in Stapleford. This pattern 
 is repeated in Wishford, though the   
 military element is less.             
   The younger population is largely   
 housed in council housing estates.    </content>
