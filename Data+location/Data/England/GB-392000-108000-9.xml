		<title>09TARRANT MONKTON CHURCH</title>
		<content> The parish church at Tarrant Monkton  
 is called ALL SAINTS and the vicar was
 going to give us a talk about it but  
 he had to go to another church the    
 week before we visited.An old man told
 us the oldest part of the church was  
 built in 1400 and the rest of it      
 later.It was very grey looking with   
 lots of hints in between blocks of    
 stone.It had a slate tile roof and a  
 square tower.Inside the church there  
 were modern things like heating,lights
 and a microphone.It looked like a     
 religious disco.There were old oak    
 pews with new kneelers and bibles in  
 every seat and a small organ tucked   
 away in the back.Outside the oldest   
 grave was dated 1813 and the newest   
 was 1984.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
