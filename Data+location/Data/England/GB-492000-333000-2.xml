 The Barracks is situated              
 along-side the A52 towards Boston.The 
 Prince William Of Gloucester Barracks 
 is one of the major depots of the     
 Territorial Army,providing the        
 headquarters of the Royal Corps of    
 Transport T.A.The barracks also house 
 the headquarters of the 54th Infantry 
 Brigade. Meetings for the Army Cadet  
 Forces are held there e.g. the        
 Colsterworth Detachment 17/21st       
 Lancers and Grantham Detachment       
 attached to the Royal Corps of        
 Transport.In 1914 an airfield was     
 constructed on this site which        
 remained in operation as a training   
 airfield until the advent of          
 jetplanes.Modern aircraft proved too  
 heavy for the grass runways and today 
 the airfield is now grassland.
