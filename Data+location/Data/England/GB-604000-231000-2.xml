		<title>02Tourism - Constable Country</title>
		<content> One of the reasons Dedham is famous   
 and tourists come here is that John   
 Constable went to school and painted  
 there. Constable was born in 1776 in  
 East Bergholt near Dedham.His father  
 owned water and wind mills and wished 
 John to follow in his footsteps.In    
 1795 he went to London to study,and   
 four years later became a student at  
 the Royal Academy.Until he was about  
 30 he learnt by imitating famous      
 painters.Then he started painting     
 landscapes of the beautiful Dedham    
 Vale,which made him and Dedham famous.
 His paintings looked very realistic.  
 "Dedham Vale","The Haywain"and the    
 "The Cornfield"are among his most     
 famous works.                         
 Sir Alfred Munnings lived in the      
 village. Castle House, where he lived 
 has many of his paintings and is open 
 to the public twice a week.           </content>
