		<content>   Growth since the war has meant much 
 new building in our D-block. Few old  
 houses remain, even 19th Century ones.
   There are 197 houses on the two     
 50s-built{service family estates:     
 Magdalene Close and Thornhill Place.  
 Although comfortable, these houses    
 seem a little austere in the 80s. The 
 estates are spacious, but the lack of 
 front gardens and mature trees leads  
 to a certain drabness. Probably these 
 homes are on a par with the village's 
 96{Council Houses.                    
    The new{private-ownership houses   
 are mainly on three estates: Prentice 
 Close, Ladywalk and Colesfield. These 
 attractive houses, 98 in all, go to   
 middle-class affluent newcomers who   
 can consider prices often over Â£50000.
 It is a grievance of village people   
 that there is little here when their  
 own children are first-time buyers.   </content>
