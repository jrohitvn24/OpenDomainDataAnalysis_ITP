		<content> Mr Pickles has a farm on Whitworth    
 Road.He has lived in Rochdale on      
 Pickles farm all his life (61 years). 
 He owns twelve and half acres of      
 land.He has four cows,lots of calves,a
 pig and twelve hens.After the cows    
 have been milked Mr Pickles feeds the 
 milk to the calves.The farm is on     
 the opposite side of the road to      
 the fields where the cows used to     
 graze and they used to have to stop   
 the traffic whilst the cows crossed   
 the road to be milked. Barratts       
 have now built houses and a school    
 (see page 7-Thrum Hall) and used a lot
 of the land ,and there is no longer   
 enough acreage for him to have his own
 milk round.Mr Pickles does not like   
 the parking in Rochdale and he does   
 not like the climate;he prefers       
 Clitheroe and places like that.
