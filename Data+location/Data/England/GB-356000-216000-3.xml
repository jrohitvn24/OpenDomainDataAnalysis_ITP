		<content>    When interviewing people in various
 areas we found that  out of our five  
 interviews,1 person had, before her   
 present job,been at school.The other 4
 had been doing various jobs.          
                                       
  The jobs were: barman                
                 postman               
                 supervisor            
                 shop assistant        
                 secretary.            
  Two people had been doing their jobs 
 for less than 6 months.Another two    
 had been doing it for three years.    
 After the other 4 interviews,we were  
 very surprised to learn that the shop 
 assistant had been doing her job for  
 15 years.
