		<content>                                       
This area is a mainly arable farming   
area. The main crop this year was      
wheat, the reat was barley and oil-seed
rape. It was a fairly poor cereal      
harvest this year due to the cold wet  
conditions this summer. There are one  
or two small meadows in Cowlinge, these
are used to graze small herd of        
bullocks and also a small flock of     
sheep. There is a prdigree herd of     
Golden Guernsey dairy cows at Little   
Bradley.The herd is now too big for the
EEC milk quota and is having to be     
reduced. They are also crossed with a  
Hereford bull to produce good beef     
cattle.
