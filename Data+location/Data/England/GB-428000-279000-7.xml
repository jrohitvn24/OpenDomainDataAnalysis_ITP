		<title>07WINDMILL FARM</title>
		<content> This 40 acre farm adjacent to the A45 
 is mainly used for grazing a pedigree 
 herd of Charolais cows, with a small  
 acreage set aside for growing         
 potatoes.                             
                                       
 Most interesting however is the farm  
 building itself; this is 265 years old
 and served as a coaching inn between  
 1720 and 1820 on the main London to   
 Hollyhead route. There is also        
 evidence that it may have been a      
 school in the 1880's. Now at a cost of
 Â£100 000 it is being transformed into 
 a 28 bedroom motel with a 50 seat     
 restaurant - a return to the modern   
 equivalent of its original use.
