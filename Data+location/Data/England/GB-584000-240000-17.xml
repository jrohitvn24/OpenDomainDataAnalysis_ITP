		<content>   Sudbury has a 3-tier system of      
education, First Schools (5-9);Middle  
(9-13);Upper(13-16 or 18).             
   I get up at 7am and reach the bus   
stop at 8. I catch the All Saints bus  
even though I go to Uplands. This is   
because I moved from Acton to Walding- 
field but wanted to stay at Uplands.The
bus drops me near Uplands. The bell    
goes at 8.45 to start school. Our      
lessons are 35 mins long with breaks   
for play and lunch.We finish at 3.30pm.
We often have Design- Woodwork, Metal- 
work,Art,Cookery,Science.We will carry 
on with these when we move to the      
nearby Upper School next year.We are   
split into ability groups for Maths    
and French, but not for English and    
Humanities.First Years have 1 teacher  
for nearly every lesson,like First     
Schools but we have several different  
ones,like the Upper.DARREN CLARKE 4T.  </content>
