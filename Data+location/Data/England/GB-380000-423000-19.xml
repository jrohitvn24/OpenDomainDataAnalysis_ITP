		<content> Groundwatch is an organisation        
 officiated to the Royal Society for   
 Nature Conservations watch groups and 
 is interested in encouraging young    
 people to care about wildlife and     
 their environment in the countryside  
 and in towns. It is run by various    
 members of Rossendale Groundwork plus 
 adult volunteers.                     
 Ponds have been dipped in and         
 discoveries have been made of         
 Rossendales very own shrimps, leaches,
 water crickets, newts, water voles and
 freshwater sponges. On drier ground a 
 variety of insects, long tailed field 
 mice and badger setts were discovered.
 In the air red admirals,              
 tortoiseshells and orange tipped      
 butterflies, bats, larks, curlews,    
 lapwings, kestrels and owls have all  
 been spotted.
