		<title>19SPORTS DAY.</title>
		<content>   Every year we have a School Sports  
 Day.  This takes place just before the
{end of term.}All four years in the    
 school take part. It takes about four 
 hours to{practice}for sports day.     
   Everyone is divided into{houses.}   
 They have colours like red, green,    
 blue and also yellow.                 
   We start off with the one hundred   
 metres run. Then we have skipping for 
 the girls.  The sack race is next and 
 the main race is the two hundred      
 metres long run.                      
   Both boys and girls take part in the
 obstacle race, but in other races the 
 boys and girls run separately.        
   Some other events are - bean bag    
 race, egg and spoon race, wheelbarrow 
 and a throwing competition.
