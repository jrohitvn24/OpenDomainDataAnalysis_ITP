		<title>18A DAY IN THE LIFE OF</title>
		<content> I'm one of five children of a farmer. 
 My day begins at 7.30, when I'm woken 
 up. I wash, dress and have breakfast  
 by 8 o'clock. Then we all go outside  
 to wait for the school taxi, which    
 takes us to Zoar Garage, where I get  
 on a mini-bus for the final part of   
 the journey to school. We reach school
 at 8.45. School begins at 9 o'clock   
 and finishes at 3.30, when we are     
 taken home in the mini-bus. I get home
 at 4 o'clock, change into playing     
 clothes, then ask Dad where the cows  
 are. I take Driver, my collie, and if 
 they are far I take my bike. When the 
 cows are safe in the milking parlour  
 yard I go in to play swing-ball. At   
 5.45 I feed the two farm dogs then    
 have my own tea. Around 6.45 - 7.0    
 p.m. two of us drive the cows into the
 field. Then I have a bath and watch   
 television until bed-time at 9.0 p.m. </content>
