		<title>05Life in Easington Colliery</title>
		<content> Alyson wrote - Easington is not a     
 place for youth. It is spoiled by     
 unemployment. As the future of the pit
 is uncertain the colliery is not      
 taking on any school leavers.         
 Easington is a close knit community.  
 During the long strike everybody was  
 helping each other. There are 5       
 churches in Easington Colliery though 
 there are very few parishoners.       
 Tristan is a choir boy at the local   
 parish church. He wrote "being a choir
 boy is quite nice and I enjoy singing.
 I have earned my second medal, a dark 
 blue one. On Sundays I lead the choir 
 into church with a cross. When our    
 choir master left I was upset because 
 he took the choir over to Durham      
 Cathedral. We are having a new central
 heating system put into our church.
