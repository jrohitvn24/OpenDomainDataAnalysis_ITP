		<title>19ALAN TITE _ CHIMNEY SWEEP</title>
		<content> My father is a chimney sweep.He has   
 been doing this job for about 4-5     
 years.He took over the job from my    
 Grandad.He works around this area     
 and often goes to Henham and Bishop's 
 Stortford.It usually takes him about  
 an hour to sweep a chimney.If he does 
 a big house, with maybe 6 chimneys,it 
 takes him about three hours.He uses a 
 vacuum cleaner and he has to use at   
 least 10 rods.He collects at least Â£20
 a day depending on the amount of      
 chimneys he sweeps.If he does four    
 chimneys he will get about Â£24.He     
 charges Â£6 for normal people and Â£4   
 for old age pensioners.He usually puts
 the rate up every year by Â£1.         
 He might have to clean out his vacuum 
 cleaner depending on the amount of    
 dust he has collected.
