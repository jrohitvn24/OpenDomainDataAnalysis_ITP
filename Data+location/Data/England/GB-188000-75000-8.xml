		<title>08PADSTOW CAROLS</title>
		<content> During the month of December, on      
 Sunday evenings,and after Evening     
 Service, a small group of people meet 
 in Market Square to carry on the      
 age-old tradition of singing the{     
{Padstow Carols.}The Carols are a      
 collection of songs,many unique to    
 Padstow,which are now,thankfully,     
 published by a local-born printer on  
 his press in Padstow so that they are 
 in no danger of being lost.           
  Having sung two or three of the      
 Carols in the Square the group,by now 
 joined by more people,move off around 
 the town singing one of the Carols at 
 a street corner or outside the house  
 of an older Padstow resident who might
 not otherwise have a chance of hearing
 them.On Christmas Eve the singers walk
 up to Prideaux Place where they sing  
 to the Prideaux-Brune family,who have 
 lived there for over 300 years.       </content>
