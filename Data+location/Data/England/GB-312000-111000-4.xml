		<title>04Where our water comes from.</title>
		<content> Hemyock's water comes from            
 Churchstanton out of the under ground 
 springs. At the moment they are       
 building a new pipeline. The new      
 source of water will be from          
 Wimbleball Reservoir. Many farms have 
 their own wells or springs. In our    
 square there are two wells and there  
 is one spring in our square. The old  
 water source came past Shuttleton Farm
 and it went past the butcher's.       
 Hemyock has                           
 a pump in the centre of the village.  
 They used to get their domestic water 
 from there and the water to put out   
 fires. The pump was built in 1902.    
 The pump does not work anymore.
