		<title>10The Parish Council.</title>
		<content>The Parish Council consists of 9 unpaid
members who meet once a month except   
for August.The clerk is paid 597 pounds
per annum.The council is responsible   
for open spaces and the closed church- 
yard.One person is employed to mow the 
grass and he is paid 1,100 pounds p.a. 
The District Council contributes 2,300 
pounds p.a.This means that there is not
much money to work with.They are       
responsible for footpaths and if stiles
are broken they ask the landowner to   
repair them.They keep a careful watch  
on the environment such as noise level 
created by the local aerodrome.If the  
roads are in a bad state of repair,the 
Council reports this to the County     
Council.The main project in 1985 is the
clearing of Pheasants Hill Common where
no-one will take responsibility of     
ownership.This will take 10 years.They 
also give advice on planning.          </content>
