		<title>07Local customs in St. Agnes</title>
		<content> The inhabitants of St. Agnes still    
 keep the Feast Day held as a feast of 
 dedication of the Church.  Originally 
 it was declared a holiday, but this is
 not so today.  Feast Monday is the    
 Monday nearest to the 21st January;   
 and each day of this week the Church  
 organises some form of entertainment -
 mostly in the evenings.               
 Also traditional is the Midsummer     
 Bonfire, held on St. Agnes Beacon.    
 This is one of a chain of fires       
 throughout the County; and is now     
 organised by the Old Cornwall Society.
 The Victorian Fayre, revived in       
 Jubilee Year, is held on the May Bank 
 Holiday (the old Whit Monday).  Stalls
 are erected in the main street and the
 square (which are closed to traffic); 
 and entertainment is provided by the  
 St. Agnes Silver band, clog dancers,  
 buskers, and a travelling jester.     </content>
