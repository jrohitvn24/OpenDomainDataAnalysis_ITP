		<title>19Smith's Green Farm.</title>
		<content> The farmhouse was built in the{17th   
{century}of lathe and plaster,         
 altered in Georgian times and added   
 to in the 1950s.  At{Smiths Green     
{Farm,}they've got 75 sows, including  
 gilts, 5 boars and 600 piglets.  The  
 boars are all named. 4 of them are    
 Landrace, 1 large white.  The gilts   
 have their first litter at 10 months. 
 A gilt has 7-8 litters. The piglets   
 stay with the sow for 3-4 weeks. They 
 are sold at 17 weeks weighing about 60
 kilograms to a slaughter house in     
 Chelmsford. The red brick farmworkers'
 cottages were made  from locally made 
 bricks. {The kiln}was still in use    
 until 1889.  Outside the village are  
 two bungalows, originally farmworkers 
 cottages.  Midway between the two     
 is a{small brick bakehouse,}with the  
 original oven inside, and a{well}which
 was still in use until 40 years ago.  </content>
