		<title>02HEMEL HEMPSTEAD INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content> The factory estate to the N.E. has    
 changed and some larger places have   
 closed to be replaced by diverse small
 units, although the trend is still to 
 skilled engineering and  high         
 technology.  Employment figures are   
 good for these times but many people  
 travel out of Hemel to work.          
 The moor near the town centre is park 
 like with grass and flowerbeds.       
 Further out the canal and moor seem   
 almost rural. Nowhere is far from the 
 countryside and a striking feature is 
 that buildings stop suddenly right    
 next to open land.This is closely     
 farmed to the N. and E. but to the S. 
 it is mostly well wooded and          
 attractive.  The town seems to have   
 more than its fair share of vandalism 
 and litter but is well liked by those 
 who can remember the old housing      
 conditions.                           </content>
