		<title>15Family Life in Knockholt</title>
		<content> There are families in Knockholt whose 
 antecedents have grown up here for    
 generations. Homes vary from small    
 cottages to large houses, some modern.
 Few families still make their living  
 from the land, but many commute to    
 larger towns and London. This is a    
 good place for growing families. Young
 children, should their parents wish,  
 are taken to Mother and Toddler Group.
 At the age of three  there is a       
 Kindergarten with trained staff. At   
 five they join the state assisted     
 Church of England School. At eleven   
 there are many schools a bus ride     
 away. Most families have interests in 
 the various village activities which  
 cater for all ages and tastes. Some of
 these have their roots in the Church  
 or the Village Club, still others are 
 independant. Most families benefit    
 from items using modern technology.   </content>
