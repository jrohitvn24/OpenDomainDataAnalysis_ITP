		<content>{By Mr.Yeomans &amp; Class 1.              
 Our area is a rural community.It      
 comprises of one main village Barcombe
 Cross,plus outlying farms and hamlets.
 The agricultural land is mainly cereal
 crops and grazing land for cattle.A   
 small amount of land is used for      
 seasonal soft fruits. Barcombe Cross  
 is fortunate in its quiet location,due
 mainly to the exclusion of many major 
 roads or housing developments.It has a
 mixture of private and rented         
 accommodation of various ages,most    
 being modern.It acts as a dormitory   
 village for nearby Lewes and Brighton 
 plus commuters to London. The local   
 junior school was re_built in 1962 and
 is one of the focal points of the     
 community.The hamlet of Barcombe is   
 the original founding village and is  
 mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1066
 under its previous name_"Bercham".    </content>
