		<content> Methodism at Diggle began under the   
 influences of the Uppermill Methodist 
 Society (est.1811) and the Bailey     
 family, methodists from Holmfirth, who
 moved to Diggle in 1864. James Bailey,
 with John Sykes,( a manufacturer who  
 lived at Holly Grove and owned Wrigley
 Mill), together established a Wesleyan
 Chapel and Sunday School at the mill. 
 Previously some Methodist Services had
 been held occasionally at Kilngreen   
 Day School, near Diggle Station. The  
 movement grew fast and a new building 
 was created in 1868 on its present    
 site on Huddersfield Road at Weakey.  
                                       
 Anglicanism was based at Uppermill    
 with Saddleworth Church as its focus. 
 It was built around 1200 &amp; was founded
 as a dependent chapelry of Rochdale.  
 It is still a popular place of worship
 for local people and visitors.        </content>
