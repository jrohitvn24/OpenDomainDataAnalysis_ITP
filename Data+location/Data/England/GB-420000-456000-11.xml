		<title>11Kettlesing - Bus v. Car</title>
		<content>   Like most rural areas, the block    
 suffers from a diminishing public     
 transport system.                     
   The West Yorkshire Road Car Company 
 provides Kettlesing village and Men-  
 with Hill with an average of two buses
 daily to Harrogate, and a connection  
 to Otley on Saturdays. High Birstwith 
 has no bus service, the nearest being 
 at Birstwith village.  Menwith Hill   
 Station has its own regular private   
 bus service to Harrogate, for all     
 station personnel.                    
   Car transport is, therefore, virtu- 
 ally indispensable, and there is a    
 growing problem of social and physical
 isolation for many groups of society, 
 i.e., the old, young mothers and      
 teenagers.
