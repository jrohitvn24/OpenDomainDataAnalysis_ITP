 Sunday 31st. March. I woke up at 9    
 O'clock, but it was really 10 O'clock 
 because we put the clock forward.I had
 my breakfast of Weetabix and toast. I 
 went upstairs to get dressed,brushed  
 my teeth and went out to garden. I got
 out my rabbit and he ran round our    
 garden. I went to plant seeds. At 1.10
 I went and helped Mum make the dinner.
 I set the table and we sat down to    
 eat. We had beef,roast and mashed     
 potatoes, carrots, cabbage, yorkshire}
 pudding, and gravy followed by Lemon  
 Bakewell. Then I went to Emma's house,
 where we talked played  games which   
 were Spellbound and Magic,and listened
 to WHAM! When I got home I watched a  
 video. At 7.30 I returned the video. I
 then watched television, but I was    
 tired so I went to bed.{
