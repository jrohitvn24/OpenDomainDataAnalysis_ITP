		<title>03How the area has changed</title>
		<content> Truro has expanded with new housing,  
 new shops, a shopping precinct, the   
 cattle market has been moved out of   
 the centre and the town always appears
 to have a traffic problem, and a      
 parking problem for cars especially in
 Summer when the tourists visit. Some  
 schools have got larger especially    
 Richard Lander School, a Comprehensive
 set up some years ago to replace the  
 Grammar and Secondary Modern Schools. 
 Equipment available to pupils includes
 TV, overhead projectors, videos, and  
 computers. School provides schemes of 
 work experience just as the state has 
 Youth Training Schemes for school     
 leavers unable to find work. Teachers 
 do not appear to be so strict today   
 as in the past; and are at present    
 involved in Industrial Action over pay
 and conditions. Unemployment is a     
 problem in Truro as in Cornwall.      </content>
