		<content> The ordinary rate for wholetime       
 workers and part-time workers         
 regularly working over 30 hours per   
 week excluding overtime is Â£2.24 per  
 hour for workers over 20 years of age.
 In an industry as well mechanised and 
 technologically advanced as farming   
 provision is made to reward, with     
 higher rates of pay, employees who    
 develop certain skills and crafts.    
 To meet the higher labour demands     
 created during the growing of many of 
 the crops in this area large groups of
 casual workers are organised by       
 gangmasters and hired out to farms as 
 and when required, thus allowing farms
 to grow crops which need high seasonal
 inputs of labour without having to    
 hold an uneconomically high number of 
 permanent employees.
