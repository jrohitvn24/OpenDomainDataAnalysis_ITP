		<content>    When you drive up the Grizedale    
 or Dale Park valleys you can see      
{forest}on both sides, and lower down  
 there are{grass fields}which          
 are walled, hedged or fenced off. Some
 of the fields will have cows or sheep 
 grazing, but others are left for hay  
 and silage. The{buildings}are made of 
 Lakeland slate, but some have been    
 rendered or pebbledashed.             
                                       
    The farms sell their{milk}to the   
 Milk Marketing Board which allocates  
 some of it for{butter}and{cheese}     
 making or just leaves it as milk. Some
 cows are slaughtered for{beef,}while  
 the sheep and the lambs are sold for  
 mutton and lamb chops. The sheep's    
 wool is bought by the British Wool    
 Marketing Board to be made into cloth 
 and knitting wool.
