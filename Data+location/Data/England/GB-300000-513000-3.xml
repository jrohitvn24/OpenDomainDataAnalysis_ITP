		<title>03A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A CHILD</title>
		<content> When I wake up in the morning I have  
 my breakfast which is cereals.Then I  
 get washed and clean my teeth.Once I  
 have done this I get dressed into my  
 school uniform.Once I am ready for    
 school I sit down and watch television
 for a while till it's time to go to   
 school.When I arrive at school I go   
 and talk to my friends till the bell  
 is rung which means you have to go to 
 your classes.In class we learn things 
 like how to do Maths and English and  
 things like that properly.After school
 I go to my Nana's for my tea then I go
 home.At home I play out with my       
 friends and build camps. I go in the  
 house about nine o clock. When I go in
 I get ready for bed then I watch      
 television till it's time to go to bed
 which is about ten oclock at night.
