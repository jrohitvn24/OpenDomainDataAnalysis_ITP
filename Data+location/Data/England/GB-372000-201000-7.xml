      In an area so exposed and so     
 intensively farmed there is not much  
 room for wildlife although there is a 
 certain amount of "overflow" from the 
 Wildfowl Trust.  The almost complete  
 lack of woodland - there are one or   
 two very small clumps of trees - means
 that the sort of habitat which would  
 support mammalian wildlife hardly     
 exists.  In addition, local farmers   
 have done their best to make sure that
 anything whose interests conclict with
 those of the cattle and crops is dealt
 with.                                 
      The few country lanes support a  
 limited number of wild plants but     
 these are all of a common nature.     
 There are one or two interesting      
 waterside plants to found along the   
 banks of the River Cam.
