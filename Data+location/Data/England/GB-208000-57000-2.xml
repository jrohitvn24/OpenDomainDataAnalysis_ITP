		<content>   After the building of the Cornish   
 Unit houses at the end of WW2         
 residential building was arrested     
 until the construction of a{sewage    
{disposal}plant in the mid 1960's.     
 Since that time six small housing     
 estates have been developed.          
   Except for the almost continuous    
 holiday traffic along Queen St. during
 the summer holidays the town has an   
 air of tranquillity.                  
   There is some evidence that the town
 is slowly becoming a tourist          
 attraction and the River Fowey        
 provides recreation and fishing for   
 salmon, trout, bass, and mullet.      
  {Restormel Castle,}to the west of the
 area is an additional attraction.
