		<title>10 SCHOOL &amp; RUSHMORE HILL</title>
		<content> {Pratts Bottom County Primary School} 
is a typical rural village school,built
in 1895 it stands in Hookwood Road,    
formerly known as Old Rushmore Hill.   
 Some 60 pupils attend it for primary  
education and apart from an annexe     
added to the original building it has  
changed little in outward appearance   
over the years.                        
 During the 1980's the school was part 
of a successful {Co-operation Project} 
involving the other local village      
schools of Downe, Cudham and Chelsfield
in developing new curriculum ideas.    
 {Rushmore Hill} was the main London to
Dover road, until Polhill was cut, and 
coach drivers used to put up at the    
local inns overnight.  Reports of      
Highwaymen abounded, the most famous   
robbery taking place in 1798. Even     
Dick Turpin is said to have travelled  
this road.                             </content>
