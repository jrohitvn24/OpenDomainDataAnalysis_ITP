		<title>05HOUND TRAILS FROM THE MOOR</title>
		<content> One of the most popular sports        
 in Cleator Moor is Hound Dog TRAILING.
 The youngest age for a hound dog to   
 race is 12 months.The pups run about  
 5 miles and the dogs run about 10     
 miles.We train the dogs by making them
 follow a scent which is aniseed and   
 paraffin.Our local trail takes place  
 over the fells it is called Wath Brow 
 Trail.The prize money ranges from Â£11 
 to Â£300.There can be anything from 10 
 to 100 hounds in a race. These canine 
 athletes have to have a special diet  
 such as shin beef,steak,eggs,sherry   
 and mince.We take the dogs for 3 walks
 a day. They run about 2 to 3 times a  
 week. The best season for racing is   
 March to October.
