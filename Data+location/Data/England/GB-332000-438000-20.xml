		<content> Our community policeman is a school   
 governor and comes to see us often in 
 school. His job is to patrol the      
 community and keep it safe for us all.
 He works from Poulton-le-Fylde police 
 station and is very friendly. The     
 police in our area are always very    
 busy especially on the first Saturday 
 of May as it is the annual Poulton    
 gala.
