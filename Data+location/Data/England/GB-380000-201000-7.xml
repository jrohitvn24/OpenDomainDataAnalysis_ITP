		<title>07WORK IN KING'S STANLEY</title>
		<content> There is a woollen mill in the village
 which employs a number of villagers.  
 It is one of the few remaining woollen
 mills in the Stroud Valley and its    
 premises are of historical interest,  
 having been built in the early 1800s. 
 A number of local people work in the  
 village shops, of which there are     
 about a dozen.                        
    There are also local services such 
 as a bakery and a garage also two or  
 three milk-delivery rounds. However   
 the majority of village people work   
 outside the village, in Stroud  and   
 Gloucester or even further afield.    
    King's Stanley people feel that the
 village could do with its own Library,
 and Doctor's Surgery.                 
 Car-parking facilities are poor.      
 Most people do a weekly 'big shopping'
 in Stroud,or Gloucester at the        
 Supermarkets.                         </content>
