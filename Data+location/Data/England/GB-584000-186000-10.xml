		<title>10RECREATION IN OUR TOWN</title>
		<content> In our town near our school,there are 
 alot of different things for us to do 
 after school and during the holidays. 
 There are two Brownie packs and a     
 Guide company,Boys &amp; Girls Brigade,   
 Scouts and Cub Scouts;these are all in
 the evening after school.             
 At the weekends some of us go to      
 dancing classes.                      
 We have a big park where we can play  
 cricket or football in the field.There
 are some courts for badminton and     
 tennis,and also putting and bowling   
 greens.                               
 There is a pond for fishing and a     
 brook where we can play and explore.In
 the middle of the park there is an    
 interesting old priory that is a local
 museum.
