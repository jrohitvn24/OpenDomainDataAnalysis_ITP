		<title>11Walks from Kirtlington</title>
		<content>There are a lot of walks for recreation
from Kirtlington. If you don't want to 
walk a long way you can go round South 
Green, past the ancient Manor House to 
the Church, up Troy Lane, past the     
Oxford Arms, Dashwood Arms and back to 
the school. For another walk start from
The Pound, go along Crowcastle Lane to 
Northbrook. Then you cross the Oxford  
Canal and the River Cherwell to        
Tackley. Cross the railway and fields  
back towards Kirtlington via Mill Lane.
For a third circular walk, enter the   
Park from South Green. You can walk    
across the Park, past the big house,   
down to the polo ground, across Akeman 
Street and to Slade Farm. From the farm
walk to Northbrook and back to the     
village, by Crowcastle Lane. Another   
walk is part of the Oxfordshire Way. It
comes from Tackley, crosses Kirtlington
Park on its way to Weston-on-the-Green.</content>
