		<title>07PLANTOME  NURSERIES</title>
		<content> Plantome Nurseries is situated on the 
 old Woodham road. It covers an area of
 approximately one hectare.  The       
 buildings on the site are one large   
 glasshouse used as the shop area, and 
 four plastic tunnels.  The nursery is 
 retail only, buying in the large      
 majority of its stock mostly from     
 Holland, but some plants come from as 
 far away as New Zealand.They sell over
 1000 varieties of vegetables and 50   
 different conifers and 50 types of    
 broad-leafed trees.  In the shop they 
 sell a large selection of gardening   
 tools, fertilisers and tender plants. 
 They sell a range of garden ornaments,
 many of which come from China.        
 They provide employment for 5 fulltime
 workers plus a seasonal variation in  
 part-time employees.  The nursery has 
 been in existance for 25 years under  
 the same ownership.                   </content>
