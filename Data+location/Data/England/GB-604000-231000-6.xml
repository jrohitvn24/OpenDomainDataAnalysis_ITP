		<title>06Parking in Dedham</title>
		<content>                                       
 A particular problem in Dedham today  
 is parking which is very difficult    
 because tourists come and park in the 
 High Street and in front of other     
 peoples houses and driveways. Dedham  
 has no parking area.The village       
 police man puts bollards up and down  
 the street by the Dedham Centre.Dedham
 is having a car park built in Pig     
 Meadow.                               
 A lot of people have trouble even     
 getting to the shops in the High      
 Street. It is even worse on a Saturday
 and Sunday.The Afternoons from midday 
 to tea time are the most crowded times
 but the Marlborough and Sun Inn have  
 quite a lot of cars in the evenings   
 also.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
