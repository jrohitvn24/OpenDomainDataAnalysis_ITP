		<content>The station is popular with commuters. 
About 1500 tickets are sold each week  
day.Approximately 80% of the people    
using the station have season tickets. 
The majority of the commuters travel to
London but some go to Maidstone or the 
coastal towns.                         
It is an important junction            
particularly because of its link with  
various industries.These include       
Rowntree Mackintosh,the Transfesa      
terminal and Mack and Edwards.British  
Railway's Red Star Service uses the    
station for a good reason.It is also   
near the motorways.The Orient Express  
sometimes passes through Paddock Wood  
on its way to the Continent.           
The live rail holds 750 volts and      
partly for this reason there are       
warning signs that trespassers will be 
prosecuted.
