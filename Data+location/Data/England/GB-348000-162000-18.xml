		<title>18Row of Ashes farm</title>
		<content> This 300 year-old stone farmhouse has 
 a slate roof on an original wooden    
 pegged structure.Some of the original 
 mullioned windows still exist - two   
 bedroom windows were sealed up because
 of the 1696 window tax.The original   
 underground water cistern still exists
 - piped water arrived in 1932.        
   The house (and gate piers of 1700)  
 are 'listed'.The farm was originally  
 called Butcombe Farm and owned by     
 Butcombe Court until about 1700.      
   About 10 years ago an archeological 
 teaching excavation investigated a    
 "simple Romano British settlement" and
 also found pre-historic remains.This  
 summer(1985) a 3-part TV serial was   
 filmed here - to be shown next April. 
   A mother and daughter live in the   
 house.The farm(mostly cattle,wheat and
 barley) is worked by the son who lives
 in nearby Row of Ashes cottage.       </content>
