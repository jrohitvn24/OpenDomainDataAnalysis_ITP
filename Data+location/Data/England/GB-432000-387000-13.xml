		<title>13CROOKES, SHEFFIELD, 1985</title>
		<content> Crookes is one of the districts of    
 Sheffield. The{buildings,}which are   
 mainly houses, are built of stone and 
 brick with welsh slate roofs. A lot   
 are now in need of repair. Crookes is 
 quite close to the city centre and is 
 also a good, modern, shopping centre. 
 It has its own{schools, churches,     
{public houses}and{cemeteries.}A       
 supermarket is now standing where the 
 old Crookes picture palace used to be.
 Although the{streets and roads}are now
 tarmac covered, in places where the   
 tarmac has worn away you can still see
 the original cobblestones. One of the 
 local schools was called Crookes      
 Endowed, it has now closed and been   
 converted into a{community centre     
 which is used for a variety of        
 activities. Crookes is a very busy    
 area with lots of traffic going up and
 down.                                 </content>
