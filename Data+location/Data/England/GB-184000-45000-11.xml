		<title>11Changes in Tresillian (1)</title>
		<content>  The most immediate and visible       
 changes in this area are the changing 
 of a few houses into a commuter       
 village.The reasons for this are      
 probably the wider use of the road.   
 This was widened to cater for a larger
 number of vehicles and as more people 
 went into Truro the more crowded Truro
 became.So Tresillian became a commuter
 village, populated by a lot of people 
 who work in Truro.                    
    Shops too have changed through the 
 past four decades.Some have diminished
 ,others have newly opened. Travelling 
 shops have totally disappeared now    
 ,these include laundry vans, grocer   
 vans, fish man, oil man etc. Other    
 standing shops have gone and the post 
 office is the only shop in use after  
 40 years.Now there is a recently      
 opened farm produce shop and this has 
 made up a little for the lack of shops</content>
