		<content> The majority of the block lies in a   
 plain bouned on the north by hills.   
 The soil is a heavy loam with a       
 subsoilof chalk and clay.  It is a    
 well cultivated and used mainly for   
 growing grain but it does support some
 cattle, sheep and horses.  The area is
 sparsely populated and very rural with
 around seven farms, the largest of    
 which houses the well known Tanhill   
 herd of pedigree Limousin cattle.  The
 Kennet and Avon canal runs east to    
 west and provides a leisure area for  
 fishing and boating.  Houses range    
 from the very old thatch-roofed type  
 to modern brichk-built buildings.     
 Farmwork is the main employment but   
 some people travel further afield for 
 work.  A normal amount of retired     
 people remain in or move to the area  
 because of the relative calm and      
 pastoral nature of the surroundings,  </content>
