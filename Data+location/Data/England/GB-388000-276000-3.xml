		<content> It is a fairly small church with a    
 congregation ranging from 16 to 60    
 depending upon the occasion. There are
 regular attenders and those who       
 only come on special occasions        
 like Christmas and Easter. There      
 are four different services; Matins,  
 Family Service ( a fun service when   
 the children attend and help out),    
 Holy Communion and Family Communion.  
 There is also a Sunday School for the 
 children. There are two clubs         
 associated with the church. The       
 Tuesday Club is for the younger       
 members and Wreckers for those in the 
 choir. At present the choir comprises 
 ten females.                          
 Churchill and Blakedown produce a     
 monthly combined Parish magazine at a 
 cost of 10p. It lists all the services
 and events that are taking place in   
 the near future.                      </content>
