		<content> Area has an equable climate, generally
 mild winters and fairly warm if not   
 always dry summers.  Underlying rock  
 formations are cretaceous with some   
 upper layers of clay with flints.     
 There are several areas of deciduous  
 woodlands where oaks and beech        
 predominate, but small coniferous     
 plantations are becoming more         
 prevalent. Flowers are generally of   
 calcerous loving species  typical of  
 which are knapweed, scabious,         
 marjoram, St.John's wort, harebells   
 and cowslips. Of rarer butterflies    
 purple emperor, white admiral, brown  
 argus, and marbled white, are present 
 but no fritillaries. Of larger mammals
 roe deer, foxes, badgers, hares,      
 rabbits and squirrels are known.      
 Shutts Copse, a hazel coppice, is     
 actively managed by the Hampshire and 
 Isle of Wight Naturalists Trust.      </content>
