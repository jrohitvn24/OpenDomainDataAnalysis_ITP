		<title>15The Band ,Kingsbury.</title>
		<content> There has been a band in Kingsbury for
 over 100 years.At present there are 43
 members,ranging from 10 to 77 years   
 old.The uniform is black with red and 
 gold trim.The band plays at church and
 school fetes,carnivals,concerts and   
 some church services.This involves the
 members in travel over a wide area of 
 Somerset and Dorset.One whole day trip
 was to the Harvest Home in Brent.We   
 went to talk to a local man who has   
 been in the band since 1945.He plays  
 the tuba.He explained how he looks    
 after his instrument by polishing it  
 and washing it out regularly with     
 boiling water.Although it is heavy he 
 tries hard not to drop it,as a dent   
 affects the quality of sound.Band     
 practice is held in the church hall   
 one night a week in summer,two in     
 winter.His wife says he has to be     
 really poorly not to attend.          </content>
