		<content> Mill and Mining Blackhead.            
 In the Downas Valley is still evidence
 of the Mill building and stones. It   
 was working in living memory.There is 
 evidence of old field walls and ridge 
 and furrow cultivation to the east of 
 the valley.                           
 Near the head of the valley tin and   
 copper may have been mined in the     
 18thC and nearer the sea audits,a leat
 and a water wheel pit can still be    
 seen.                                 
 These were worked for some years in   
 the 19th C.                           
 There are also some old shafts near   
 beagles point.                        
 Look for butchers broom growing round 
 the Mill ruins.
