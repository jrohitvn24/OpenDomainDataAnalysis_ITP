		<title>10A DAY FOR GARETH SWANAGE</title>
		<content>   After our playtime we do Country    
 Dancing. At midday we eat our lunch. I
 usually have sandwiches and some      
 orange juice. Sometimes I have a piece
 of cake. When we have finished eating 
 we play for half an hour.             
   After lunch we work on our reading  
 scheme. At 2.30pm we play football but
 when the first bell rings we have to  
 stand still until the second bell     
 rings when we walk to our lines.      
 Before going home at 3.30 we have     
 Singing, Art or Religious-Education.  
   I walk home with my sister and my   
 Mum. When I get there I have my dinner
 and play with my friends or watch     
 television until 7 o'clock when I go  
 to bed.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
