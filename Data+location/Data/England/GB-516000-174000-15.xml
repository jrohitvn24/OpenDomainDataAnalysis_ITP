		<title>15THE TERRACE GARDENS</title>
		<content> The Terrace Gardens is one of the     
 loveliest places in Surrey. Before the
 Terrace Gardens were built there was a
 large building on that site. The      
 building was called Lansdowne House.  
 It was knocked down and they built the
 Terrace Gardens there in 1880. The    
 Terrace Gardens are large Victorian   
 gardens. There is a cafe there where  
 you can have a small snack. There are 
 passages leading to different parts of
 the garden. When you go to the Gardens
 there is a pond and on one side of the
 walls there are archways. In the      
 Autumn the leaves on the trees are    
 beautiful and their many colours      
 attract many visitors. I like to roll 
 down the hill at the Terrace Gardens  
 or look from the top of the hill down 
 to the River Thames. People picnic in 
 the sunshine on the hillside. They    
 feed the squirrels from their hands.  </content>
