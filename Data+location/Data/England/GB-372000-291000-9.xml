		<content> Linking up with the A.442 is the main 
 Wolverhampton road. As a large number 
 of the towns population commute each  
 day,these roads are in constant use.  
 Our school is the only primary school 
 on the eastern side of the river.The  
 Queens Parlor over looks our school   
 and Lowtown which is built up with    
 houses, a few shops and some small    
 buisnesses. Lowtown is not the oldest 
 part of Bridgnorth as is the Hightown 
 of Bridgnorth, but this once important
 inland port carried all the raw       
 materials for the raging furnaces of  
 the Industrial Revolution which had   
 found its birth upriver.
