		<title>02River Ouse   North Yorkshire</title>
		<content>  The river is tidal to Naburn lock    
 and is bounded by ings land which is  
 either grassland or high grade arable 
 protected by earth flood defences.    
  Flooding is frequent during the      
 winter months and after heavy         
 rainfall.  Large areas of Grassland at
 the confluence of the Ouse and the    
 Wharfe, and the village green         
 bordering Stillingfleet beck are most 
 affected.{                            
{ It has frequent traffic, the majority
{of vessels being pleasure craft.      
{Commercial traffic has been reduced to
{the occasional loads of newsprint     
{being transported to York.            
{ Members of the water_ski club based  
{at Cawood use the river, as do        
{anglers.  Their catch includes chub,  
{eel,and "flatties".}
