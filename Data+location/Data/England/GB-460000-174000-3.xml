		<content> sprayed with chemicals.               
 The farm has two major problems.  The 
 deer from the nearby National Trust   
 Woodland often feed on the barley.    
 The rabbits from the woods have eaten 
 nearly 2 acres of crops this year.  An
 expensive chicken mesh fence about 2  
 miles long around the field has been  
 used to deter the predators as neither
 shooting nor gas has helped matters in
 the past.                             
 The farm ownership has changed hands 3
 times in less than 5 years for no     
 apparent reason.
