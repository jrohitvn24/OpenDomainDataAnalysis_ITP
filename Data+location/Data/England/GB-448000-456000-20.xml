		<content> FEW PEOPLE IN THE AREA ARE OF ORIGINAL
 STOCK WHICH WERE YEOMAN FARMERS AND   
 AGRICULTURAL WORKERS. NOW THEY ARE    
 MAINLY PROPERTY OWNERS, HOUSES FARMS  
 OR LAND. ALTHOUGH MANY HAVE COME FROM 
 OTHER AREAS AND LEAVE TO WORK THE     
 COMMUNITIES ARE MORE ISOLATED THAN IN 
 FORMER TIMES WHEN FERRIES PLIED AND   
 RIVER TRANSPORT PREVAILED. THOUGH A   
 BRIDGE TO REPLACE THE FERRY BETWEEN   
 THE MONKTONS WAS PROPOSED IN 1947 IT  
 WAS NEVER BUILT.MOST FAMILIES OWN     
 CARS. PRIVATE CONTACTS ARE THEREFORE  
 SIMPLE WHILST THE VILLAGES REMAIN     
 ISOLATED CUL-DE-SACS. DURING WORKING  
 HOURS THEY APPEAR DESERTED SPECIALLY  
 MOOR MONKTON WHICH HAS NO SCHOOL. THEY
 ARE DEVELOPING INTO DORMITORY VILLAGES
 THOUGH OLD FOOT-PATHS AND             
 BRIDLE-PATHS EXIST RIGHTS OF WAY ARE  
 OFTEN UNDER DISPUTE. THE INHABITANTS  
 APPEAR TO ENJOY THE QUIET LIFE.       </content>
