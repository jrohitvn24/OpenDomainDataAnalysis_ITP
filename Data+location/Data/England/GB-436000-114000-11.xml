		<title>11Southampton Water Bailiff</title>
		<content>   We went to the{River Test}for the   
 day to study nature and interview Mr  
 Vic Foot, the water bailiff.          
   Police Constable Stenton was with   
 him on a metal bridge over the river  
 and they told us they work closely    
 together. They are good friends.      
  "We are always trying to keep off the
 undesirable elements. The people who  
 trespass, cause a nuisance to the     
 fishermen and damage to the river."   
  "The worst problem is{poaching}. We  
 see some pretty nasty things done to  
 fish with great hooks, and also traps.
 We've had some adventures alright!"   
   Vic Foot has been water bailiff for{
{43 years}. There are{Trout,Salmon,Eels
 in the river. It's very expensive to  
 fish here with a licence. What was the
 best thing about his job?             
  "All of it really. I like the freedom
 and the river itself is very special."</content>
