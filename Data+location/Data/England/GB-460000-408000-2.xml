		<content>{Thorpe Marsh Power Station}was        
 officially opened in 1967.The site was
 chosen because it satisfied these four
 requirements:-1.adequate source of    
 cooling water available(River         
 Don)2.sub strata capable of supporting
 heavy loads.3.good road and rail      
 access 4. sufficient area available   
 for ash deposition.The installation   
 has two generators each capable of    
 producing{500 meggawatts.}Each unit   
 has a pulverised coal fired steam     
 raising boiler.There are three cooling
 towers to each boiler.Because of silt 
 in the River Don three{settling ponds 
 are provided between the river pump   
 house and the cooling water system.A  
 total of approximately 100 tons of ash
 per hour is produced and this is      
 disposed of on the station ash fields.
 These ash fields are the site of
