		<title>14A school caretaker's work</title>
		<content> Mrs Bedford is the caretaker of       
 Witherley Primary School. She comes to
 school each morning at 7 o'clock and  
 opens up. She checks the school and   
 does a little cleaning, and then goes 
 home.  She returns to school at       
 quarter past 3, which is when the     
 children finish their lessons. Her    
 main job then is sweeping the floors, 
 though she says that perhaps her most 
 important job is cleaning the toilets.
 She finishes work at 6 o'clock.       
                                       
 In her work she uses dusters,         
 brushes, a mop and bucket, and a lot  
 of disinfectant.                      
                                       
 She says that she likes her job.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
