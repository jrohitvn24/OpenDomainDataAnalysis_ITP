		<content> ABOUT 60% OF THE POPULATION IS OVER   
 RETIREMENT AGE. MANY OF THEM ONLY     
 MOVED HERE ON RETIREMENT, AND AGREE   
 THAT IT IS A QUIET, PEACEFUL, PLEASANT
 AREA. HOWEVER, MOST PEOPLE WOULD LIKE 
 MORE FACILITIES FOR BOTH YOUNG AND    
 OLD. THER ARE THREE AREAS OVER WHICH  
 THERE IS EXTENSIVE DISAGREEMENT: THAT 
 THE CRIME RATE IS HIGH OR LOW; THAT   
 THE LOCAL SHOPS ARE ADEQUATE OR NOT;  
 AND THAT THE LOCAL TRANSPORT IS OR IS 
 NOT ADEQUATE. LOCAL CRIME IS MOSTLY   
 BURGLARY. OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS MANY 
 NEW HOUSES HAVE BEEN BUILT. THE PEOPLE
 HERE HAVE ELECTED CONSERVATIVE        
 REPRESENTATIVES FOR BOTH LOCAL AND    
 NATIONAL GOVERNMENT. THE BIGGEST      
 IMPROVEMENT EVERYONE WOULD LIKE TO SEE
 IS AN AVAILABLE SWIMMING POOL; THE    
 NEAREST ONE IS 6 MILES AWAY IN        
 HASTINGS.                             
                                       </content>
