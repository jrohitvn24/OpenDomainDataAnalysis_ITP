		<content>  On the Cadland Estate conservation   
 has been given quite a high priority. 
 Work that is going on includes:-      
 1.{Gravel Extraction.}Gravel extracted
 in Blackfield is used for making paths
 and concrete. Where gravel has been   
 extracted there is a programme of     
 restoration including the creation of 
 new footpaths and bridleways.         
 2.{Forestry.}Amenity woodland,mainly  
 hardwood,has been planted to improve  
 the estate E.G. the belt of Ash trees 
 planted to screen the Fawley by pass. 
 There are several plantations of Scots
 Pine &amp; Western Hemlock which are used 
 for fencing and coastal defences.     
 3.{Nature Reserve.}The southern part  
 of our survey area is designated as an
 area of outstanding natural beauty.The
 estate looks after the reserve in     
 conjunction with the warden of the    
 North Solent National Nature Reserve. </content>
