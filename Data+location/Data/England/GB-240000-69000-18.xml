		<content>       In  the  old days  the community
 spirit  was  very   strong   as   most
 villagers were  interrelated.  Today's
 ease  of  transport  has  altered this
 completely.On Saturday nights the main
 street  of  Gunnislake  was busy  with
 people talking  and  being entertained
 by the Salvation Army  or  local brass
 band.  This area  always used to be  a
 musical area.                         
       On  Sunday  evening  people from
 all the villages  in our area went "Up
 Turnpike". This was the main road from
 the  station  to the end  of  St Ann's
 Chapel.  Many  local  romances started
 here.                                 
       People  were prepered  to sit up
 all night with the sick and dying  and
 help out in times of need. In the 20's
 and 30's the poverty for some families
 was  shocking   especially  one-parent
 families.                             </content>
