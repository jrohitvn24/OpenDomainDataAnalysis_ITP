		<title>07KIVETON PARK STATION</title>
		<content> Kiveton Park passenger station is     
 situated between Shireoaks and Kiveton
 Bridge stations on the Sheffield to   
 Lincoln line. The freight line that   
 runs through Anston, Dinnington &amp;     
 Laughton stations joins at Brancliffe 
 Junction, just east of Kiveton Park   
 station. That line was closed to      
 passenger traffic in 1929.            
   The old station yard has been       
 redeveloped as a storage warehouse for
 Fyffes bananas. The old station       
 building which stood empty for        
 years is now being used by DMS        
 Electronics, a company specialising in
 computer sales, maintenance and       
 development. The Station Hotel ,now a 
 pub, which used to provide            
 accomodation for travellers is on the 
 other side of the minor road          
 (B6059).
