		<title>19 CLIFTON - BUILDINGS</title>
		<content>   The {HOUSES} in Clifton are mainly  
built of stone. About half are older.  
Of the 30 or so modern houses, 20 are  
on estate called County View.          
   There is a terrace of brick built   
houses.                                
   Most of the houses are big and      
nearly all are built along the main    
road.                                  
   There is a {PUBLIC HOUSE} called the
'Duke of Northumberland's Head'        
   Other interesting buildings are the 
old {WATERMILL} ,the {CHURCH} of St.   
James (now a jewellery factory) and the
{CHAPEL} which is now redundant. One   
house of note is 'White Gables' which  
has gable ends extending to the ground.
