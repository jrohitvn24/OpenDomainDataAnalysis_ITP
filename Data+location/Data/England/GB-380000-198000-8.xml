		<title>08Crops at Upper Lutheredge.</title>
		<content>   The crops the farmer grows are wheat
 and barley.Wheat and barley have been 
 grown on the same land for 25 years.  
 In the Middle Ages they practised     
 rotation of the crops which enriched  
 the soil so the next year's yield was 
 greater. At the bottom of the barley  
 crop there is a diseased leaf. To     
 prevent the disease spreading up, the 
 crops are sprayed with modern         
 fungicides. The top leaves work hard  
 to use the sunlight to create starch. 
 Nitrogen is put on the soil to make   
 the crop a darker green with bigger   
 leaves. It has to be given the correct
 amount of fertilizer to make it grow  
 as well as possible.The yield has been
 increased from 1.25 tonnes to 3 tonnes
 per acre. The barley is planted in    
 mid-September and harvested in        
 mid-July so it has{10 months}to grow. 
 The barley grows from October onwards.</content>
