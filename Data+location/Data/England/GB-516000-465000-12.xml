		<title>12Day in the life, Bridlington</title>
		<content>   My dad is a Tourist officer. The    
 first thing he does when he gets to   
 work is look through the post. He     
 usually gets around twenty letters a  
 day. Then he talks to the staff and   
 tells them what to do. Then he answers
 complaints. He looks through the      
 newspaper adverts and takes money from
 the people who want to advertise in   
 the holiday guide. He then has lunch, 
 sometimes with a newspaper reporter.  
    After lunch he may design a poster 
 which will be printed in Trinity Rd.  
 There are over 300 poster sites in    
 Bridlington. Over a million posters   
 and leaflets are produced in a year.  
 My dad's job is to sell Bridlinton,   
 that means persuading people to come  
 here for their holiday.               
    Often he goes away to talk about   
 Bridlington and he shows slides of the
 area.                                 </content>
