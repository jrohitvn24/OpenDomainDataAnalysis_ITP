		<content>            GOTHAM CHURCH              
                                       
  St Lawrence church is just over eight
 hundred years old.It stands to the    
 right of the village square.The old   
 graves surround the church  but the   
 newer graves are in the cemetery on   
 the other side of the main road.The   
 church is made of stone and an early  
 type of broach spire is believed to be
 the only one of it's kind in          
 Nottinghamshire.                      
  Some architectural changes have been 
 made to the church over the last      
 fourteen years.One major improvement  
 has been made to the west entrance,   
 which was the addition of a tower door
 and a floor for the bellringing       
 chamber.
