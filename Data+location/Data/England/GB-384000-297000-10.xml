		<title>10THE CANAL</title>
		<content>Running across the survey area is the  
Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal;
which runs from Stourport to nearby    
Wolverhampton.                         
  The Canal was engineeered by James   
Brindley soon after the completion of  
the Trent and Mersey Canal. Opened in  
1772 the Canal is no longer an         
important source of transport. It is   
today a source of leisure-Boating      
Holidays and Fishing.                  
  The section of Canal runs from Pool  
Hall Fartm rising to Wightwick Mill    
LOck(this is apparently one of the     
oldest sections of the Canal). A total 
of two locks and four bridges. At      
Wightwick Bridge there is still a      
Boatyard and Hire Centre. Down at Pool 
Hall Farm  there is a large resevoir   
which is well used by the local Angling
Club.                                  
                                       </content>
