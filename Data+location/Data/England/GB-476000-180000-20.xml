have found it to be a worthwhile,      
exciting &amp; enjoyable experience.We see 
ourselves in the unique position of    
linking the past of William I &amp; his    
Domesday Book,1085,to the future       
through us - the children,the teacher &amp;
all the people involved in this Survey,

out in cars and minibus to survey the  
area.From our studies,we have made our 
own Domesday Books in writing &amp; drawing
