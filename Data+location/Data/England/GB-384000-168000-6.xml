		<title>06H.M.S.ROYAL ARTHUR,CORSHAM</title>
		<content> H.M.S Royal Arthur is not a ship but a
 land base for training sailors        
 and Petty Offices for leadership. The 
 Commander is in charge of training.   
 There are 102 sailors and some        
 civilians who work there. Some live on
 the base,others in Corsham. The       
 assault courses are to train leaders. 
 They also have lectures and parade    
 drills. This all takes on average 10  
 hours a day. They start work at 8am.  
 They train for 2,3 or 4 weeks and then
 go back to sea. The base covers 450m  
 x250m,is all above ground and was     
 built in 1939. In 1945 it was used as 
 a Polish Refugee Camp and the Navy    
 took over in 1947. One of the first   
 officers to work at the Royal Arthur  
 in 1947 was Prince Philip,the Duke of 
 Edinburgh. There are 36 buildings in  
 all,including classrooms and offices.
