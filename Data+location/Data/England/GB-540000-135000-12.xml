		<title>12MY SATURDAY</title>

 I get up at 8:00 and have cereal for  
 breakfast. After washing and dressing,
 I watch a T.V. programme called No.73.
 My grandmother usually visits on a    
 Saturday and she arrives a 11:00.She  
 sits in our large leather chair and   
 knits.We then have lunch at 1:00.In   
 the afternoon  I go to Boots or W.H.  
 Smith's to do some shopping.If the    
 weather is poor I might be forced to  
 do some homework! If I can I watch the
 old films on Channel Four.They are    
 very different from today's films.At  
 6:00 we have tea and then I watch T.V.
 throughout Saturday night. I prefer a 
 lazy Saturday doing little as I do a  
 lot of work on a Sunday.              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
