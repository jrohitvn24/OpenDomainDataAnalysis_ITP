 During half an hour there were two    
 phone enquiries about hotels and      
 flights.The agent said that the most  
 popular holiday resorts were in Greece
 and Portugal.The most popular holidays
 in Britain are coach tours.The average
 number of customers in a day is 15 and
 in a week 90.There were 2 special     
 offers available,a trip down the Nile 
 and a cruise on the liner QE2.
