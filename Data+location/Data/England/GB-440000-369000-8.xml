		<content> Our school was built with a Community 
 Centre joined onto it. It is for      
 anyone in the village to use and there
 are many different activities each    
 week.In the daytime we help to get the
 room ready for the play and toddler   
 groups and for the Baby Clinic on a   
 Wednesday afternoon.This is for the   
 mums of Calow and Arkwright to see the
 Health Visitor with their babies.The  
 centre is used most evenings for      
 dancing classes,pottery,keepfit,Drama,
 Brownies,Beavers,Slimming Club,Youth  
 Cluband for many different meetings.  
 There are Jumble Sales,Childrens      
 Parties,Weddings and Dances too.      
 At lunch time some of the Senior      
 Citizens come into school and have    
 their lunch with us.                  
 In the centre there is a large room   
 that can be made into two small rooms,
 a kitchen and a quiet reading room.   </content>
