		<title>14Farms around Willingham</title>
		<content> There are four main farms in the      
 village area.Each employs no more than
 3 people. One farm grows only wheat,  
 the other 3 a combination of{wheat,   
{barley, potatoes, carrots, peas and   
{sugar beet.}Very{few animals}are kept 
 except cats for rodent control.       
 Woodhall Farm is 120 acres and has    
 turkeys. Bridge Farm is approximately 
 234 acres, Glebe farm is 170 acres and
 Middle Farm 250 acres.                
 Extensive use is made of tractors.    
 Some of the other machinery such as   
 fertiliser spreaders and sprayers is  
 often loaned.                         
 All the farms have been in the same   
 family for more than{30 years.        
 Apple orchards, which were once a     
 feature of the area, are disappearing 
 as the trees are grubbed up to make   
 way for more profitable cereal and    
 root crops.                           </content>
