		<title>02HISTORY OF THE AREA</title>
		<content> All of this area was owned            
 by                                    
 Glastonbury Abbey from the 7th Century
 to 1539. The village of West Pennard  
 was part of a manor that was given to 
 the Abbey by King                     
 Ealdred. Thus,instead of being ruled  
 by a lord, the manor was ruled by the 
 Abbot.In the original Domesday survey 
 (1086) West Pennard was included under
 East Pennard which is situated about  
 4km away on the east side of Pennard  
 hill. The manor continued in the      
 possession of the Abbey until the     
 dissolution of the monasteries in 1539
 when it was seized by the crown. Later
 it was granted to the first Duke of   
 Somerset. The same thing happened to  
 Norwood Park which is in the west of  
 our area. The original Norwood Park   
 was a rural retreat, owned and enjoyed
 by the Abbots of Glastonbury.         </content>
