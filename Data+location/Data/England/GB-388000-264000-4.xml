 Today we visited the Berry Hill       
 Industrial Estate.We noticed that the 
 Postal Delivery Office was on the     
 Estate.We went to look around.As we   
 entered the public visitors room we   
 found it was like a jail keeping the  
 mail safe.A man came to the door and  
 showed us a postcode book.He explained
 that the first three numbers were the 
 area postcode and the last three were 
 the street numbers.For instance the   
 Droitwich postcode is WR9.Hampton     
 Lovett Farm -WR9 OWL, Thatchers Piece,
 Boycott - WR9 9EF and Rashwood Farm - 
 WR9 OBW.                              
 All the mail for Droitwich comes from 
 Worcester.At Droitwich it is sorted   
 into areas and streets using the      
 postcode.
