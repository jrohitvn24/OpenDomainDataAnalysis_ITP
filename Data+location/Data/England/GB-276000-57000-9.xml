		<content> All children have to travel out of the
 area for their education. Primary     
 school aged children go either to     
 Harbertonford, Diptford, or           
 Dartington, while secondary education 
 is provided by a comprehensive school 
 and sixth form college in Totnes.     
 Further and adult education is        
 available mainly outside the area     
 although a few village based classes  
 have recently started up.             
 All health care facilities are        
 available in Totnes, with Doctors,    
 a group practice, clinics, Dentists   
 and a small cottage hospital.         
 For emergency treatment etc patients  
 have to be transferred to Torbay or   
 Plymouth.
