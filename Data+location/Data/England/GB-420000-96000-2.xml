		<title>02A Day in the Life of Jennie</title>
		<content> This morning I got up at 7.45 and went
 back to sleep till 8 0' clock.I got   
 dressed and went downstairs for       
 breakfast-I had cornflakes.I went to  
 get all my school belongings ready and
 set off for school at about           
 8.40,arriving at 8.50.We waited for   
 the whistle to go and then lined up at
 8.55.In the cloakroom I took my coat  
 off and went down to assembly.In      
 assembly we talked about teams,this   
 lasted for half an hour.Afterwards I  
 went back to class and did some maths 
 for about twenty minutes.The fourth   
 years went to another teacher because 
 the third years in our class go       
 swimming.At 12 o'clock I had lunch.I  
 have a packed lunch but some children 
 have school lunches.Afterwards the    
 whole class went onto the field to    
 play rounders.This is a game where you
 have a bat and a ball and two teams.  </content>
