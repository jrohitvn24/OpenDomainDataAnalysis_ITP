		<content> The area lies on the southern flank of
 the{Mendip Hills,}between the market  
 towns of{Wells and Shepton Mallet.}The
 post-war suburbs of eastern Wells     
 extend into the study area, but the   
 other settlements are{picturesque     
{hamlets}built in attractive local     
 stone, often with distinctive{pantile 
{roofs.}Indeed, one of its outstanding 
 characteristics is the{variety of     
{landscape}found in such a small area. 
 In the south,the{Sheppey Valley}within
 2km, changes from a dramatic          
 tree-lined{gorge}into a broad, gentle 
 valley of meadowland; rising to the   
 north is a wooded ridge which provides
 an attractive backdrop to the villages
 of{Dulcote, Dinder and Croscombe.}In  
 the N.W, however, post-war growth by  
 Wells has raised{conservation}issues. 
 To the N.E., an ancient beach now 150m
 O.D. gives fine{panoramas of Somerset.</content>
