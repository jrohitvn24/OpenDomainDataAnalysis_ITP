		<title>17Woodham Ferrers Conservation</title>
		<content> The farming land in Woodham Ferrers is
 divided up between five farms. The    
 change since the second world war has 
 been from dairy farming to arable and 
 now few cattle are left. The main     
 crops grown are wheat, rape, beans,   
 peas for canning. The appearance of   
 the countryside has changed. Hedges   
 have been removed in large numbers and
 fields have been integrated. Much     
 natural cover has been removed so that
 nesting sites for small birds have    
 been drastically reduced. The road    
 verges are sprayed so wild flowers are
 very scarce. Conservation groups are  
 active and are trying to make the     
 community aware of the problems facing
 the countryside. Many ponds have been 
 filled in by farmers. There have been 
 many campaigns aimed at the general   
 public such as plant a tree year,     
 build a pond year &amp; nature programmes.</content>
