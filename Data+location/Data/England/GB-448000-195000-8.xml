		<title>08THE FAIRS OF ABINGDON</title>
		<content>The first of the charters to be        
connected with Abingdon was granted    
by Edward 1 in l290. It was giving the 
King's permission for a seven day fair,
beginning on the 9th June, to be held  
in honour of St. Edmund.  The money    
raised from this fair to be used for   
the upkeep of the chapel of St.        
Edmund,which was possibly in West      
St. Helens Street.  By 1609 Abingdon   
was allowed to hold seven fairs, each  
for a different purpose.  The fair was 
moved to Ock Street mid-way through    
the l8th century, by which time it was 
held on Michaelmas, and was a hiring   
fair,where men looked for work.  A     
week later the runaway fair is held,   
when labourers could be re-hired, who  
had run away from their new employer   
after the Michaelmas Fair.  These two  
fairs are still held today.(see page 9)
