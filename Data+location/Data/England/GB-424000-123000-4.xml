		<title>04Cowesfield House Pig Farm.</title>
		<content> Cowesfield House Farm belonged to     
 Mr.Jewell for 30 years until 12 years 
 ago when he made a partnership with   
 his son Colin.The farm is used for    
 breeding pigs.When the pigs have been 
 fattened up they are{sent,at 18 weeks 
{old, to the abattoir}to be killed for 
 pork .When piglets are born they      
 usually  weigh 3_5 pounds,while the   
{sows weigh 400 pounds}and the{boars   
{about 500 pounds.}After the first 3   
 weeks of mothers milk  the piglets go 
 onto barley and wheat pellets which   
 the other pigs eat as well.There are  
 21 boars and 580 sows.Each sow        
 produces about 2.3 litters of 11 or 12
 piglets per year.No pigs ever see a   
 field although the whole farm covers  
 about 10 acres.There are just never   
 ending lines of sties,nearly all      
 indoors.
