		<content> To the north of the town, is the      
 Industrial Estate. This is separated  
 from the housing areas by a park and  
 open space. Several large factories   
 are there, like Fords and Yardleys.   
                                       
 These factories provide employment for
 many of the people that live in       
 Basildon. Many of the wives also work.
                                       
 New factory sites are being developed 
 around the other edges of Basildon,   
 and these are attracting more of the  
 high technology sort of industries.   
                                       
 Gordons Gin have just opened the      
 biggest distillery in Europe to the   
 west side of Basildon.                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
