   A popular game locally is called    
 40.40.in. To play you need four or    
 more players. You choose a post and a 
 person to be 'on' and that person     
 counts to 40 at the post while the    
 others hide. After having counted to  
 40 the person who is on looks for the 
 others, and if they see anyone they   
 run back to the post and shout,"40.40.
 in, I see xx hiding at such and such a
 place." The first person caught is    
 then the person who is on next time.  
   To avoid being on any of the players
 can run undiscovered to the post and  
 call, "40.40.in.", and so guaranteeing
 that they will not be chosen to be    
 "on" next time.
