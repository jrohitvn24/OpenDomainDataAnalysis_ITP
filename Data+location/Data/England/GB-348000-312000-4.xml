		<title>04FARMING BY THE RIVER.</title>
		<content> Farming in the area is controlled  by 
 the actions of the{River Severn.}The  
 silt carried down by the floods makes 
 the soil close to the river very      
 heavy.{Cultivation}of this land is    
 unsuitable so most of the land close  
 to the river is used as pasture land  
 for cattle and sheep.In the northwest 
 of area{Gravel Hill Farm}is able to   
 cultivate its land because of its soil
 make-up .Sugar beet,barley and wheat  
 are their main crops .The barley is   
 harvested in July and delivered to the
 local Maltings.The wheat harvested at 
 the same time is shipped out of the   
 area to be used in bread production.  
 The sugar beet is harvested in        
 September and sent to Allscott sugar  
 beet factory.{Birds}attacking the     
 ripening barley cause the farmer a lot
 of problems.
