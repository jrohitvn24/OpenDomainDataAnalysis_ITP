		<content>   There were many houses. Mr clarke   
 lived in hykeham all  his life and he 
 only left when he joined the army.he  
 has had many jobs like a solier and a 
 baker.As a baker Mr.Clark got up at 1 
 a.m. to make the bread by mixing the  
 ingredients by hand in a wooden       
 trough;16 stone of flour(112kg),and   
 15 gallons of water (75 litres).      
 It was cooked in an oven over a       
 wooden fire and it took about 2\ to 3 
 hours to reach the correct temperture 
   The bakery was where the present    
 post office is now .He delivered the  
 bread by horse and cart to            
 Bracebridge,South Hykeham and to      
 Whisby.There were no convenience foods
 then ,mostly vegtables that they have 
 grown in their own gardens.           
   Every sunday they would have a large
 joint of meat such as beef or pork    
 that would last for most of the week. </content>
