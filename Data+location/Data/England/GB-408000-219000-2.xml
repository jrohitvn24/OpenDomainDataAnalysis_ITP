		<title>02Visitors Guide To Notgrove</title>
		<content> Superb views from the main A436 road  
 greet the visitor entering this area  
 from the West. Just behind a layby    
 near West Field Farm, is the Notgrove 
 Long Barrow open to the public. Taking
 the Notgrove road the visitor soon    
 enters this charming and peaceful     
 village, with its neat cottages well  
 restored and surrounded by attractive 
 gardens full of flowers and           
 vegetables. No modern development mars
 the view of the mellow Cotswold stone 
 buildings, between which are glimpsed 
 grazing sheep and growing crops. The  
 parish church of Saint Bartholomew has
 a small octagonal spire, and is of    
 Norman origin, although it is said to 
 stand on the site of a Roman burial   
 ground. It has much to show the       
 visitor, including a Needlework       
 covering the wall behind the Altar.
