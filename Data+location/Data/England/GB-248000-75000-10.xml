		<title>10Quarries in Peter Tavy Area</title>
		<content>                                       
   There are quite a few disused       
 quarries in this area.Two of the      
 largest are at Pitts Cleave and       
 Wilminstone.The Pitts Cleave quarry   
 was closed five to ten years ago.It   
 only employed about fifteen people.It 
 quarried igneous stone used for roads 
 and buildings.This quarry closed down 
 because the owners, E.C.C., had too   
 many quarries.Wilminstone quarry      
 closed in the late Fifties, early     
 Sixties when the quarry was almost    
 worked out.The stone was used only for
 roads.They employed only a small      
 number of people.The site of          
 Wilminstone quarry is now used as an  
 Industrial Estate with three factories
 there.The old quarry itself is now    
 used for an adventure training area.
