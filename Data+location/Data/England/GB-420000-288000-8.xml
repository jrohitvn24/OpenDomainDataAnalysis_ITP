		<content> The church has a lot of different     
 activities for the young,the youth    
 club is the main attraction which is  
 held on Wednesday at 7.30pm.In the    
 winter the meetings are in the town   
 hall and in the summer on the         
 croft.The"church" often goes on walks,
 outings and visiting places.In the    
 actual church there are two main      
 activities that the young can be      
 involved in,the choir which is growing
 and the bell ringers which quite a few
 children enjoy.The ringers for a      
 wedding get Â£2.00 each.All of the     
 churches in Coleshill come together   
 occasionally and the young meet new   
 people and make new friends within the
 churches.There is a Sunday school     
 which meets every Sunday morning in   
 the town hall,they come to church     
 every first Sunday in the month,that  
 is when we all have coffee afterwards.</content>
