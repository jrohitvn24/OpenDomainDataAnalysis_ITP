		<title>10THRIFT FARM</title>
		<content> Thrift Farm is an establishment for   
 severely educationally subnormal      
 people. In the main they come from    
 Queen's school in Bletchley. It is the
 only one of its kind in the country.  
 The farm is not run to make a profit  
 but by selling its produce it does    
 manage to break even. There are 52    
 acres of land. A range of animals are 
 kept including 25 cattle, 60 sheep,   
 200 chickens, producing roughly 160   
 eggs per day, a donkey and some goats.
 A variety of crops are grown and sold.
 They include bedding plants,          
 herbaceous plants and vegetable       
 plants.
