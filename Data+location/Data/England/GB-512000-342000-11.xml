 We saw some wild bees which had a     
 hive in an old fallen down tree.I got 
 stung by a bee in the neck.We saw an  
 old sundial which had come from the   
 walls of the old manor house.It was an
 hour slow.It works when the sun shines
 on the sundial and the shadow of the  
 hand moves.Winkhill Farm has got three
 tractors.There was a shed where you   
 throw bales of straw from a trailer.In
 the garden we saw a ha-ha which is a  
 wall which goes down and there was a  
 ditch with grass at the bottom.It is  
 to stop cattle from getting on the    
 garden and it gives a good view of the
 cattle and the fields.
