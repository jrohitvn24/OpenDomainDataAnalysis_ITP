		<content>  Farming is the principal industry of 
 the area.  Most farms are owner -     
 occupied.  Crops grown include        
 cereals, potatoes and other root      
 crops, cider apples, hay, silage, oil 
 seed rape and soft fruit (pick your   
 own).  The majority of the area is    
 arable.  Beef cattle are bred,        
 including a pedigree herd of Hereford 
 cattle in Kingsland.  There is one    
 local dairy herd.  Breeds of cattle   
 in the area include Herefords,        
 Charolais, Friesian and Simmental.    
 Sheep, poultry and bees are also kept 
 locally.  Breeds of sheep include     
 Suffolk/Clun, Welsh half-breeds and   
 other cross breeds, Kerry and Jacob.  
 Sheep dogs are bred locally and are   
 sold by auction.  Poultry includes    
 geese and guinea fowl as well as      
 chickens.
