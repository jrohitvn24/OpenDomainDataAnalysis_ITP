		<title>12THE DEWEY MUSEUM, WARMINSTER</title>
		<content> Inside Warminster's new Library is a  
 Museum, with a workroom, storeroom and
 public display area run by the local  
 History Society. Its collection of    
 local material has come about mainly  
 through donations, but the displays   
 and conservation work are paid for by 
 the Society, partly supported by the  
 County Council. Volunteer Museum      
 Curator Mr Jack Field is putting on   
 special displays in 1985 for the 40th 
 anniversary of VE Day, and for a      
 Deverill Valley Festival. Apart from  
 the Museum, the Society arranges      
 lectures and outings for members, and 
 in 1984 published a book of old       
 photographs of the town. Mr Field     
 believes the town has a fascinating   
 history unharmed by recent building   
 developments; but he will be keeping  
 an eye on the new by-pass "to see what
 turns up"!                            </content>
