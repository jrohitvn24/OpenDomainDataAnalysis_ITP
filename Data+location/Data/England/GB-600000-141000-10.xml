industrial area is Brett's Gravel      
Quarries, where sand and gravel are    
quarried .                             
   This sand forms a ridge which lies  
north-west to south-east across the    
valley and forms a ridge on  which     
Lord's and Sweet Willow woods stand.   
A woodland area of mainly Sweet
