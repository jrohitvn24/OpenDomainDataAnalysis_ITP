		<content> A TRAFFIC SURVEY CARRIED OUT AT       
 VARIOUS POINTS AND TIMES DURING THE   
 DAY (10 JULY 85) REVEALED SOME        
 INTERESTING INFORMATION.THE GREATEST  
 VOLUME THROUGHOUT THE DAY WAS THAT OF 
 PRIVATE CARS.THE NUMBER WERE          
 PATICULALY HEAVY BETWEEN 9a.m.        
 AND10a.m. THIS IS SUPRISING SINCE IN A
 SEPARATE SURVEY OF EMPLOYMENT A HIGH %
 OF PEOPLE TRAVLE 5 MILES OR MORE TO   
 WORK BY CAR.WHAT WAS SLIGHTLY         
 SURPRISING WAS THE HIGH NUMBER OF     
 HEAVY VEHICLES USING ROADS IN WHAT IS 
 ESSENTIALLY A RURAL AREA.THERE IS NO  
 DOUBT THAT MOST OF THE ROADS ARE      
 INADEQUATE FOR SOME OF THE JUGGERNAUTE
 USING THEM.THIS WAS CONFIRMED BY      
 SEVERAL INHABITANTS WHO FELT THAT     
 HEAVY TRAFFIC THROUGH THE VILLAGES OF 
 BUMBLES GREEN AND EPPING GREEN  WAS   
 EXTREMLEY DANGEROUS
