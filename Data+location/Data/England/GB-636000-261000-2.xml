		<content>Saxmundham is bi-sected by the A12     
trunk road,although it is very shortly 
to be by-passed on its western side.   
The town was on the former Great       
Yarmouth to Ipswich Mail Coach run. The
coaches stopped at the Bell Hotel 4    
times a day, 2 times travelling to     
Yarmouth and 2 times to Ipswich.       
The Eastern Counties Omnibus Company   
has a bus station in the town and runs 
about 18 buses out of Saxmundham to    
Ipswich and a similar number from      
Saxmundham via the local villages to   
Leiston and Aldeburgh. There are 4 taxi
services operating in the town.        
Out of 82 families interviewed 69 had a
car and of them 14 families had 2 cars.
