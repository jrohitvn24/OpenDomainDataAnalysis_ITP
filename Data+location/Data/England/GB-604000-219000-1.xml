		<content>  This area has an estuary and a tidal 
 creek and large areas of salt marsh   
 and low lying land.                   
  The geology is dominated by glacial  
 sands and gravels which have triggered
 the development of extractive         
 industry. While some quarries are     
 active and even expanding others have 
 been reclaimed for agriculture and a  
 few have become attractive lakes      
 providing a habitat for water birds.  
  There is much arable land, some woods
 and several large orchards. The area  
 of orchards has been much reduced over
 recent decades due to residential     
 development. The connection is        
 retained by the naming of roads after 
 varieties of apple.
