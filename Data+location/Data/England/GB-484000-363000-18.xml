		<title>18Local History _ The Vicarage</title>
		<content>  Records show that a vicarage existed 
 next to the church in 1736."A vicarage
 house consisting of three bays or     
 something better,there is some little 
 brick a stone about it,and the greater
 part of it with clay walls and it is  
 covered with thatch".The vicarage has 
 been rebuilt at least once and the    
 present building is mostly Georgian.In
 1932 the vicarage was sold into       
 private hands,in actual fact the new  
 owner exchanged his substantial       
 residence near Lincoln Cathedral for  
 the Vicarage and about 80 acres of    
 land.The Vicarage has since changed   
 hands on several occastions and within
 the last two years it has been sold   
 again to become a private school for  
 mentally handicapped pupils.A newer   
 smaller vicarage now stands in Station
 Road.This is a modern building        
 reflecting the life style of 1985.    </content>
