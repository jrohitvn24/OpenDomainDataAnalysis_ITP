		<title>17POWLESLAND FARM</title>
		<content>   Powlesland  Farm is owned by the    
 Powlesland family.The farm house was  
 built in 1240 and today they have     
 157 acres.                            
   We visited the farm to find out what
 sort of crops they grow and what      
 stock they keep.We found out that they
 grow wheat,barley and grass to feed   
 their stock.While the cereals are     
 growing,the fields are sprayed with   
 chemicals from a helicopter to prevent
 disease.When the crops are harvested  
 the farmer uses tractors,trailers,    
 combine harvesters and balers.        
   This summer has been a bad year for 
 cereals because it has been very      
 wet so a blower was used to dry the   
 grain.If the grain is not dried and it
 is stored wet,it will go mouldy and   
 rot.Powlesland Farm produces this     
 grain as feed for their herd of 150   
 calves.                               </content>
