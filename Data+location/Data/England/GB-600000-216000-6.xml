		<title>06HOUSES IN LANGENHOE AREA</title>
		<content> In this area there are few houses     
 outside the village of{Abberton and   
{Langenhoe.}Originally the village of  
{Langenhoe}was centred around the      
 Church, which is no longer standing,  
 but its site is to the south of the   
 present village. A new housing estate 
 was built in the 1970's in{Abberton.  
 Many of the children who attend       
{Langenhoe School}live on this estate. 
                                       
 Until the early part of the 20th      
 century, there were some cottages on  
 the marshes, probably belonging to    
 fishermen.                            
                                       
 Apart from a few houses and bungalows 
 on the main road, there are now only a
 few large houses, most of which are   
 farm houses.{Sir A. Buck,}Conservative
 M.P. for{Colchester North,}lives in   
 this area.                            </content>
