		<content>    The main industry in this area is  
 farming.Most of this is very mixed and
 noone relies on just one crop or      
 animal.                               
    The microfilm centre is the largest
 employer.                             
    There are several self_employed    
 builders and one employs at least     
 three other men.However this is all   
 small scale; repairs,extensions       
 conversions,with the occassional new  
 building.                             
    There are three agricultural       
 machine and car workshops.            
    Mr. Smith operates an earth moving 
 plant business from Milltown.         
    Little Silver Quarry,(small amounts
 of silver were found) has been closed 
 for several years,but recently test   
 blasting has been carried out again.It
 supplied chippings but now there is   
 only the Readymix concrete works there</content>
