		<title>03The Canal</title>
		<content>    The canal was built because        
 a) Chelmsford was the main market town
 of the area and the canal provided a  
 cheap, quick way to export the main   
 produce of the locality (mainly cereal
 crops) to other parts of the country. 
 b) Similarly, Chelmsford needed       
 commodities such as coal and timber.  
 c) The roads were in a dreadful       
 condition and goods took too long and 
 were too expensive to transport in    
 this way.                             
 d) Imports were previously unloaded at
 Maldon who imposed taxes which further
 increased the price of goods.         
  The effects of the canal include :-  
 Chelmsford became richer, Maldon      
 poorer; Heybridge Basin was           
 established and Heybridge grew in size
 and became more cosmpolitan;{Bentall's
 moved to Heybridge changing it from a 
 farming village to an industrial one. </content>
