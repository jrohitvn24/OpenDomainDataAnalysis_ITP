		<title>06GEDDINGTON'S NEW ARRIVALS</title>
		<content>Most of the new arrivals moved to      
Geddington to take up work in the area.
The   village was chosen by some       
because it has its own school, albeit  
small. It is an ideal place for        
children. The new arrivals were        
usually made to feel at home and       
settled in rapidly.  Others missed the 
company of close friends left behind.  
All the new residents are glad they    
came to live in Geddington, praising   
the friendly atmosphere and the Village
Hall leisure complex for lectures,     
keep-fit, badminton, tennis and bowls. 
Many looked forward to the opening of  
the new school with its increase in    
facilities. Some mentioned that they   
would like the school to be larger.
