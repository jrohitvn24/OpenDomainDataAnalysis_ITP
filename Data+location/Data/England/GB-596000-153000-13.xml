		<content>  Throwley is in the North Downs       
 Conservation Area. There are numerous 
 footpaths and bridle ways which       
 attract walkers to the area. Many     
 local people ride for pleasure. The   
 paths provide access to many fine     
 stretches of woodland.                
   Particular places of interest       
 include Throwley church with its fine 
 tombs and Tudor figures of the Sondes 
 family, as well as the memorials to   
 the Harris family of Belmont. There is
 also Arnolds Oak, where a man trap can
 be seen embedded in the base of a     
 large oak tree.                       
   Belmont Park, on the Northern fringe
 of Throwley may eventually open to the
 public, following the recent death of 
 the 5th Lord Harris. His unique       
 collection of clocks from around the  
 world may be on show.
