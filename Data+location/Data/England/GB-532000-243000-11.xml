		<title>11TO BE OLD IN BASSINGBOURN</title>
		<content> The old people's homes are situated in
 Spring Lane. They provide a community 
 for the aged. There is a meals on     
 wheels service to feed those who can't
 get around or fear the outside world. 
  Each year some of us visit the old   
 people's centre to sing carols and    
 share our Christmas happiness with    
 them. The village has an Over 60's    
 club where people go to play cards,   
 talk and have a general get-together. 
  Here are some ideas about being old. 
{ To be old is to be lonely,to live in 
{fear of being mugged. Some depend on  
{others, for work,food and play.       
{They plead to their sons and daughters
{to bring their grandchildren to stay. 
{They need love, care and attention in 
{their last years of life.
