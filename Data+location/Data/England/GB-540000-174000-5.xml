area.There is little industry in Eltham
and many of the residents commute to   
work in central London by train or car.

The Rochester Way Relief Road is being 
built because they want to build a     
bigger and better road because the one 
that we've got now cannot cope with the
amount of traffic.At Well Hall,Eltham  
Well Hall station and Eltham Park      
station have just been demolished(July 
1985) and a new Eltham station has     
replaced them as part of the relief    
road improvements.The demolishion of   
the fine Edwardian station ,Eltham     
Park, caused some local protest.
