		<content>   The sheep that took over the fields 
 in the autumn were store lambs and    
 ewes bought from Scotland,Hereford,   
 Kent,etc.Popular breeds were Border   
 Leicesters and Suffolks,with some     
 handsome Jacobs here and there.       
   Some of the autumn intake           
 disappeared to market before Christmas
 but most were with us till Easter.As  
 winter wore on and snow came,extra    
 food was taken out to the flocks.From 
 January on,tiny lambs appeared.By     
 March the winter-fattened store lambs 
 were being sold.                      
   Spring being late,the cows were not 
 back in the fields till May,and       
 tractors were not clattering up and   
 down the lanes with silage till early 
 June.Hay was made late,if at all,this 
 year,but an Indian summer meant that  
 second silage was successfully cut.
