		<content>  There are two swimming pools in      
 Ilford. One is an indoor pool. The    
 outdoor pool is in Valentines Park.   
 Also in Valentines Park is a boating  
 lake, bowling greens, tennis courts,  
 football and cricket pitches and a    
 miniature golf course. A survey shows 
 that 52 local people visited the park 
 in one hour. Of 26 interviewed, 10    
 went everyday and the others once a   
 week. People went for walks, to       
 entertain chilren and for sports, but 
 wanted improved toilets and more      
 benches.  There are two snooker clubs.
 The Kenneth More Theatre has 365 seats
 and a 50 seat restaurant, a licensed  
 bar, coffee bar and 50 seat studio    
 theatre. The under 35's enjoy discos, 
 eating out and sport while over 35'S  
 prefer walking, gardening and         
 knitting.
