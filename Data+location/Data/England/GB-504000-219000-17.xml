		<title>17TRADE SHOPS IN LUTON</title>
		<content>Our area has many shops in Luton and in
Caddington elsewhere there are few. In 
Luton there are lots of corner shops   
especially in the older parts. One     
pupil lives in a shop her father gets  
things to sell from a Luton Cash and   
Carry or from London. The shops sells  
mainly food but also some toys. It is  
open from 9am to 6.30pm and is part of 
the SPAR group.   There is a small set 
of shops at the end of Dallow Rd which 
has been there for 15 years. On Farley 
Estate the shops are a little older,   
they are at Rockley Rd, Cross Ways and 
Whipperley Ring. The latter is the     
largest and is near a petrol station,a 
pub and the community centre. Most     
people go regularily to Luton's main   
shops, the Arndale, which is indoors.  
There is an indoor market, Debenhams   
department store, Sainsbury and Tesco  
supermarkets and a large car park.     </content>
