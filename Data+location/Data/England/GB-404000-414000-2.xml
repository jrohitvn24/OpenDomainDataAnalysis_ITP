		<title>02FARMING:DARTMOUTH ESTATES.</title>
		<content> Over half of the farming land in the  
 block is owned by the ninth Earl of   
 Dartmouth whose ancestor acquired it  
 by marriage around 1720.The Dartmouth 
 Estate has 3500 acres mostly to the   
 south of the A640 Rochdale to Halifax 
 road and extending into the next block
 south.The Water Authority owns about  
 one sixth of the land while the rest  
 is in private hands or is moorland;-  
 unsuitable for viable farming.        
   Lord Dartmouth rents his land to    
 tenants who, through historical       
 circumstance, own the buildings.These 
 rents depend on the quality of the    
 property's grassland.The tenants hold 
 a 'Candlemas Tenancy' which expires on
 February 2nd.Rent increases are based 
 on land values and the profitability  
 of the acreage.EEC.quotas which limit 
 production have led to a 'nil-growth' 
 period in dairy farming.              </content>
