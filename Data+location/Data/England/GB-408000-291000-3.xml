		<content> The area was chiefly agricultural land
 before 1910, producing both root and  
 cereal crops.  After the middle of the
 nineteenth century the village of     
 Erdington started to grow rapidly and 
 gradually agricultural land was       
 swallowed up.                         
 Today the area is largely suburbs     
 consisting of a variety of housing    
 including modern, private and council 
 estates but with some houses surviving
 from the turn of the century.  The    
 older houses are chiefly along the    
 main roads from the City, Slade Road, 
 George Road, Gravelly Hill and some in
 what was the centre of the Village of 
 Erdington.                            
 There is no heavy industry in the area
 but there are a number of good        
 shopping centres and other facilities.
