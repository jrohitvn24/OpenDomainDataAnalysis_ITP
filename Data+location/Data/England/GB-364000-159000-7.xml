		<content>     Most of the people we interviewed 
 were old people. Most of them did a   
 lot of knitting but not a lot of      
 sport.                                
   Nearly everybody watched a lot of   
 television.'The news'was by far the   
 most popular programme.               
   Half of the people we interviewed   
 liked to read books.People read       
 newspapers most of all.               
   Fishing was not very popular and    
 nobody went to the beach very often.  
   Gardening,however, was very popular 
 indeed.
