		<content>   The M.1 motorway, Britain's first,  
 is a very important feature of this   
 area. The motorway runs from{London,  
 through the centre  of England,to     
{Leeds.}It passes close to many  major 
 cities, providing quick and easy      
 connections for industry and personal 
 travel.This area has benefitted from  
 the motorway because of families and  
 industry moving in to take advantage  
 of the easy access to the motorway    
 system. It is possible to drive from  
 Loughborough to London in little over 
 an hour.                              
 This section of the M.1 is at the     
 centre of Britain's motorway system   
 and it is possible to reach most      
 corners of the country just using the 
 fast, continuous dual carriageway     
 roads. New industry has been attracted
 by this prospect of fast economical   
 movement of materials and products.   </content>
