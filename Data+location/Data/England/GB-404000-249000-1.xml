		<title>01THE AREA OF SALFORD PRIORS</title>
		<content> The area we surveyed is a rural part  
 of Worcestershire and Warwickshire    
 with about 3000 inhabitants.          
 The two villages Salford Priors and   
 Harvington and the hamlet Abbots      
 Salford have grown up around the      
 farming and market gardening industry.
 Salford Priors itself is so called    
 because it once lay on an important   
 saltway from Droitwich where the road 
 crossed the river Avon. Then Priors   
 was added when the village and        
 surrounding land belonged to          
 Kenilworth Priory. Abbots Salford was 
 given its prefix when the hamlet was  
 retained by the abbey at Evesham.     
 Farming in the area is mainly arable  
 with orchards and market gardening as 
 well. The nearest market town is      
 Evesham, the centre of an important   
 agricultural area famous for its fruit
 and vegetable produce.                </content>
