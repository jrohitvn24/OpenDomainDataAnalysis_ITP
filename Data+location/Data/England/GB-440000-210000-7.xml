Freeland Primary School is a small     
school that looks like a house with    
yellow bricks and a pitched roof and   
fairly small windows. It was built in  
1967. The school is surrounded by a    
wall but it is not very high, the      
grounds are mostly grass and they have 
a lot of sycamore trees.  The field is 
on a slope and they have a football    
pitch and a running track. There is a  
netball court of tarmac which also has 
a 5-a-side football pitch marked on it.
At the back of the school is a small   
swimming pool. There is a climbing     
frame in the school grounds. The       
school used to have a pet corner but it
has over grown. They have four bird    
boxes next to the kitchen. There is a  
bike shed for 18 bikes, but there were 
no bikes in it even though the children
were all at school.                    </content>
