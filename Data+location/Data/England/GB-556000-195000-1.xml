		<content> The area surveyed is a mixed          
 residential and agricultural area to  
 the north of the dormitory town of    
 Brentwood which provides all main     
 services apart from small shopping    
 parades, primary schools and the      
 mobile library. Much of the through   
 traffic has disappeared following the 
 opening of the M25 in 1983. The       
 outlying villages are largely         
 populated by middle class people      
 working in London or locally and most 
 of the older houses have been modern_ 
 ised. A few farms have been bought by 
 businessmen ofen uninterested in      
 cultivating land but hoping to sell   
 some for development. The farms still 
 working produce arable crops. The area
 is generally affluent with high car   
 ownership and poor public transport.  
 Most residents find it a quiet        
 pleasant area to live in.             </content>
