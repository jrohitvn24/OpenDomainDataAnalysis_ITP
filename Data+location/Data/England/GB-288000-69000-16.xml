		<content> Stokeinteignhead has a primary school 
 (5 to 11) which serves the village and
 also Combeinteignhead, Netherton,     
 Haccombe and Rocombe. Five years ago  
 numbers were up to 70 children and    
 three teachers but numbers have now   
 dropped to 30 with two teachers. There
 has been a school in Stokeinteignhead 
 since 1870. The primary school in     
 Combeinteignhead closed in l926.      
 Secondary age children normally go to 
 the comprehensive school in Teignmouth
 although some, by parental choice go  
 to schools in Newton Abbot or Torquay.
 The local authority provides free     
 transport for children going to       
 Teignmouth High School but not for    
 children going to other secondary     
 schools. Children can be considered   
 for the Torquay Grammar schools if    
 their parents so wish.
