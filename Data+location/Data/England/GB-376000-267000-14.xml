		<title>14ABBERLEY HILLS PRESERVATION</title>
		<content>{  ABBERLEY HILLS}are part of a range  
 which stretches southwards to the{    
{Malverns}through {Woodbury}and {      
{Ankerdine. }                          
                                       
   There were several small quarries   
 whose stone was used in local         
 building, but in{1951}permission was  
 granted to quarry the south-east side 
 of Abberley Hill facing Astley. Local 
 people became progressively more      
 alarmed as huge bites were taken out  
 of the hill with old woodlands being  
 destroyed in the process.             
                                       
   Such was the concern that in {JULY  
{1977}the {ABBERLEY HILLS PRESERVATION 
{SOCIETY}was formed. Its objects are to
 promote interest in the Abberley      
 Hills, in their history and natural   
 history and to preserve the amenities 
 of the area for the public benefit.   </content>
