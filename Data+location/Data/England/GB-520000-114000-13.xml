		<title>13THE COMMON, HENFIELD.</title>
		<content>   The Common is a large expanse of    
 land which grows fairly wild and      
 free.There is a cricket pitch and     
 bowling green.  Sometimes there are   
 Circuses or Fun-fairs on the Common.  
 It is funny to see llamas and camels  
 roaming about!  The Summer Show used  
 to be held here under a big marquee.  
 There was a big Firework Display held 
 here during the Silver Jubilee        
 Celebrations and an Elizabethan Fair. 
 There is an old horse trough.  There  
 are bridle paths and footpaths about. 
   There is plenty of wild-life.  When 
 I went I saw different insects and    
 grasses.  There were spiders and      
 stag-beetles.  I picked up a log and  
 underneath was an ants' nest but it   
 wasn't very big.  There  were moths   
 and butterflies and grasshoppers.     
 There was plenty of cuckoo spit. I saw
 blackbirds and blue-tits.             </content>
