		<title>17VISITORS' CENTRE, STONEHENGE</title>
		<content> Fargo plantation has been proposed as 
 a vistors' centre and would have the  
 usual facilities, plus a              
 re-construction of the stone circle,  
 giving information to the tourist. A  
 series of footpaths leading the       
 visitor from one point of interest    
 to another have been opened up with   
 walks clearly marked and stiles       
 provided where necessary.             
 The main stumbling block seems to be  
 the close proximity of two busy roads 
 the A303 and A344 - closure of the    
 latter causing controversy amongst    
 local residents. As this road bisects 
 the site its' closure appears         
 inevitable whichever plan is adopted. 
 The site must be improved and a       
 compromise must be reached in which   
 way we develop the site for future    
 generations, but at the same time we  
 must preserve the past.               </content>
