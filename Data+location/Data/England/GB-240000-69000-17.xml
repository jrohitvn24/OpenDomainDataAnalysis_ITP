 the Juniors  and the  Infants. We have
 15 minute playtimes at 10.40 and 2.15,
 dinner time is  from  12.00 until 1.15
 and we finish school at 3.30.         
         On   Monday   mornings  we  go
 swimming at Launceston Leisure  Centre
 which  is   about  16  miles  away. We
 have  games   on  Tuesdays,  craft  on
 Thursdays   and   Art  on  Fridays. We
 do  Maths  and English  every day. Our
 Enviomential   Studies  include  Local
