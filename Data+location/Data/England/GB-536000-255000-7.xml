		<title>07POPULATION SURVEY</title>
		<content> In the 12Km area all the population   
 lives in either Comberton or Toft,    
 apart from those at 3 isolated farms. 
 We estimate the population is about   
 3400.The number of children is about  
 2000.There are about 1000 married     
 adults and 400 unmarried. There are 40
 people who live in the old people's   
 home in Toft.The old people get       
 cheaper fares on trains and buses.If  
 it's freezing in Winter they get      
 cheaper electricity.Some people are   
 willing to give others practical      
 help,some are not.Most people drive   
 but the elderly don't often.The       
 elderly go out about twice a day      
 shopping or walking.A lot of old      
 people like a cup of tea or coffee    
 instead of cold drinks.Of the         
 pupils at the Meridian School 110 have
 parents who commute to Cambridge or   
 further.                              </content>
