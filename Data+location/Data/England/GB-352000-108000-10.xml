		<title>10Pendomer: Footpaths</title>
		<content> The map shows a number of footpaths   
 and bridleways. Most of these evolved 
 to serve a population which travelled 
 on foot, or occasionally on horseback.
 One at least was a drove road for     
 taking beasts to market. Now, most are
 little used and difficult to follow   
 for those who wish to use them. This  
 is not because farmers have           
 deliberately blocked them; rather it  
 is that unused paths across land which
 is intensively grazed or cultivated   
 soon disappear, or a best become      
 almost impassable in wet weather. Even
 the dog walkers find them unrewarding 
 - one cannot let a dog loose in a     
 field where there are animals, and    
 dogs are not good with stiles. For    
 horse riders, apart from the often    
 soft or uneven going, there are gates 
 to be opened and shut so they often   
 prefer to keep to the quiet roads.    </content>
