		<title>16HEALTH- NORTHLEACH HOSPITAL</title>
		<content> Northleach hospital was originally a  
 workhouse built in 1834. In 1948, it  
 was converted to a cottage hospital,  
 reducing the beds to thirty-eight,    
 divided into 5 wards; each was named  
 after a Cotswold river. The hospital  
 is now a G.P unit, taking local       
 patients, with daily visits from local
 practicioners. They care for a variety
 of patients, mostly elderly, but also 
 the terminally and acutely ill. They  
 are looked after by various staff,    
 from opticians and dieticians to a    
 hairdresser. The staff run a yearly   
 fete in Northleach, organised by the  
 hospital, and take part in church     
 services held in Northleach Church. It
 is obviously important for the        
 hospital to be involved in town life.
