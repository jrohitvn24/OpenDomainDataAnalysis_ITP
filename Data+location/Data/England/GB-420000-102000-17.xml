		<title>17Why Burley is Popular.</title>
		<content>   Burley is a popular tourist village 
 and we asked groups of tourists in one
 day why they liked Burley. Eleven     
 people were interviewed. They came    
 from:                                 
 Leicester,Staines,Watford,Wareham,    
 Kent,Essex,Devonshire,Ashley Heath,   
 Lancashire,Chesterfield and           
 Stevenage. Most people had seen the   
 village.The things that they liked    
 best were the ponies,forest,cleanness,
 shops and Burley being peaceful and   
 quiet. Everybody we talked to liked   
 Burley very much. They were all here  
 for a holiday apart from the people   
 from Wareham and Ashley Heath.They    
 would all come to Burley if they had  
 the chance.Most of them come here     
 every year for a holiday.They come    
 here for the forest and the rest and  
 the sunshine.
