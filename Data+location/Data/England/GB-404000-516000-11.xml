		<title>11OLD BUILDINGS-BARNARD CASTLE</title>
		<content> For both local people and visitors to 
 Barnard Castle there are buildings    
 of historic interest.The most obvious 
 one is the Norman Castle from which   
 the town got its name.Founded in 1112 
 by Bernard,son of Guy de Baliol a     
 Norman knight.The Market Cross or     
 "Buttermarket" as some locals call it,
 now serves as an unusual traffic      
 island. It is an octagonal building   
 dating from 1747 and was once the Town
 Hall and covered market.Not far down  
 the Bank is Blagraves,dating from the 
 early 16th century,it is now a high   
 class restaurant and was once the inn 
 where probably Oliver Cromwell stayed.
 Some of the hotels were built in the  
 17th century and the King's Head,which
 is the largest hotel,is where Charles 
 Dickens stayed in 1838 when collecting
 material for Nicholas Nickleby.
