		<title>19A DAY AT SCHOOL</title>
		<content>{This is a normal school day for a     
{secondary pupil.                      
    At 9:00 I go into my form room,    
 then I have 1 hour 10 minutes of      
 mathematics in which I am working on  
 linear graphs. Then I have Craft for 1
 hour 45 minutes. I have made a mobile 
 in metal.                             
    Dinner is next (55 minutes),       
 followed by French in which I learn   
 some new words. Next is History - we  
 are doing the Anglo-Saxons. In music  
 we play the recorder, then I go to my 
 form room for ten minutes while we are
 registered.                           
    At 3:30 I go home and get changed. 
 I do my homework and, at 5:45, I have 
 my tea.                               
    Later on I do more homework before 
 going to band practice.               
    I go to bed at 10:00.
