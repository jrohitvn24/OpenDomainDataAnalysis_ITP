		<content> Area to the North of the river Ribble.
 This area is mainly Farmland and      
 Marshland reclaimed from Tidal        
 Marshes. The farming is Dairy and     
 sheep.                                
 The marshland contains a Sewage plant 
 which decontaminates sewage from the  
 surrounding areas of Penwortham,      
 Freckleton and Leagate.               
 The plant processes on average 26.25  
 million gallons of sewage per day with
 a maximum of 48 million gallons. The  
 semi sewage water is pumped into the  
 river Ribble whilst the sludge is     
 concentrated. This solid waste is used
 as land infill along with household   
 and industrial refuse. The main       
 tipping area being 'Lagoons' on       
 Freckleton Marsh. The area to the     
 East- Clifton Marsh- is being prepared
 for future tipping. This area is      
 expected to be in use for 25 years.   </content>
