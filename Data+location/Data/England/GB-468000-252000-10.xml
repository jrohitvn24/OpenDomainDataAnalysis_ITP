		<title>10St Mary's Church, Gayton</title>
		<content>The Church of St Mary the Virgin stands
in the north-east corner of Gayton.    
It has a Saxon tower and walls that    
were built about 800 years ago. Much   
has been added since. There are a      
number of carved tombs in the church.  
One, of Sir Philip de Gayton,          
is wooden. Another statue was probably 
carved by Wm. de Ireland who also made 
"Queen Eleanor's Cross" just outside   
Northampton.                           
Although Gayton has a population of    
about 490 only 50 people are actively  
involved in the church today. The      
attendances at services rage from 30   
on Sunday mornings to 6 in the         
evening.These figures have not changed 
for 15 years.The Church has a regular  
choir of 4 but no other organised      
groups. During the year there are      
usually 2 weddings, 6 funerals, 5      
christenings and 5 confirmations.      </content>
