		<content> The 'D' block is situated a little to 
 the West of Reading.The largest urban 
 area is the village of Pangbourne     
 situated on the river Thames on the   
 opposite bank from Whitchurch.There   
 are two further villages in the block,
 Tidmarsh and Upper Basildon. Tidmarsh 
 situated in the valley of the river   
 Pang. Upper Basildon is up Pangbourne 
 hill on the edge of the Berkshire     
 Downs. The area is largely rural,     
 containing farmland and woodland. In  
 rural areas most of the housing is for
 those in the middle to upper income   
 brackets, although there is a council 
 estate, Wakeman's near Upper Basildon.
 The area is changing,both because of  
 the building of the M4 motorway and   
 the gradual expansion of nearby       
 Reading. In most cases the surveyors  
 received a warm welcome from the      
 inhabitants.                          </content>
