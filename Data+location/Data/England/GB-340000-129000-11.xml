		<title>11HOUSING, HIGH HAM AND AREA</title>
		<content> There are 172 dwellings within the    
 block, in the villages of High Ham and
 Aller and the hamlets of Henley, Low  
 Ham and Beer. The vast majority of    
 houses were built between 1850-1900.  
 Blue lias stone is the main building  
 material, with roofs of red pantiles. 
 Modern builders are required to follow
 this style using reconstituted blue   
 lias stone. 115 of the dwellings are  
 detached; 19 are semi- detached; 7 are
 terraced; 28 are bungalows and 3 are  
 mobile homes. 7 houses are under      
 construction in 1985. These are 3-4   
 bedroomed houses which will sell for  
 some Â£70,000. Bowdens has a site for  
 40 holiday caravans, used for 6 weeks 
 in the summer season. There are       
 several 'listed' buildings dating back
 to the 16th century,e.g. Manor Farm,  
 High Ham. House names reflect past    
 use:"Wheelwrights","Old School House".</content>
