		<title>01PYRFORD AREA: INTRODUCTION.</title>
		<content> This block, 30 miles S.W. of London,  
 contains the villages of Ockham and   
 Wisley and parts of Pyrford and       
 Ripley, each different in character.  
 PYRFORD, though much developed with in
 filling &amp; a large housing estate,keeps
 its rural identity. WISLEY,belongs to 
 the Royal Horticultural Society. Its  
 Saxon name, "Wet Meadow",explains lack
 of development. RIPLEY, now by-passed,
 is still a busy area with shops, inns 
 and a large green. OCKHAM remains an  
 undeveloped real village. All these   
 communities are low-lying, with no    
 hills, Pyrford being 130ft above sea  
 level. All have attractive old        
 buildings but are short of low cost   
 housing. It is an affluent area with  
 cars rather than public transport. The
 future of this farming-cum commuting  
 area depends on the effect of the M25,
 and Wisley airfield/green belt policy.</content>
