		<content>    In all of our villages there is a  
 Post Office and General Stores. In    
 Butleigh and Baltonsborough there is  
 also a butcher. This contrasts with   
 both villages a hundred years ago. In 
 Butleigh one hundred years ago there  
 was a carpenter, a blacksmith, a co/op
 with a bakery, two more bakeries, a   
 person who sold alcohol, a shoemaker, 
 a tailor, one butcher, a saddler and a
 Post Office. Then it was self         
 sufficient but now all major shopping 
 is done outside the village.          
    In Baltonsborough there were seven 
 blacksmiths, seven dressmakers, six   
 shopkeepers including four butchers,  
 five masons, six basketmakers, five   
 washerwomen, two millers, two bakers, 
 three gardeners, three thatchers, a   
 wineseller and a rugman. Nowadays,    
 Baltonsborough is no longer           
 self sufficient.                      </content>
