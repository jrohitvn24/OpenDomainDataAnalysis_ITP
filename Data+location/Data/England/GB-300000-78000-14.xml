		<title>14SANDY BAY DAY OUT.</title>
		<content> We left the coach and met Mr.         
 Freestone at the Country Life Museum. 
 There were 3 sixth formers there to   
 take a group.First we had to find     
 Sandy Bay beach.When we got there,the 
 6th formers went along the clifftop,we
 went along the beach.After a while, we
 sat down and were told what to do.Mark
 had to walk along the first tide line 
 and record the litter he saw.Denise   
 and Elizabeth tried to find seashore  
 creatures.Tom and I went with Mr.     
 Freestone to find some types of       
 plants,we took a plant book.The three 
 most common plants were Plantain,     
 Horsetail and Bramble.There was one   
 plant that we didn't know and wasn't  
 in the plant book.We had our lunch at 
 Orcombe Point and afterwards, some of 
 us went swimming.At 2.30, we had to   
 walk back to school.When we got       
 back,we were very tired.              </content>
