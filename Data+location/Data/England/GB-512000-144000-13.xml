 The South-East corner, which has a    
 spectacular view to the South Downs,  
 has the site of Anstiebury Camp,      
 dating from l800 B.C.  It has been    
 excavated by archaeologists in recent 
 years.  The only reference available  
 is from a previous 'dig': "Hanstie or 
 Anstie Bury" by R. A. C. Godwin-Austin
 published by Wyman &amp; Sons in "Surrey  
 Archeological Collection", Volume 5,  
 pages 2l - 23.                        
                                       
 However, a local archivist states that
 this and Holmbury Camp were probably  
 built as defence fortifications       
 against an invasion by Julius Ceasar  
 and date from the first century B.C.
