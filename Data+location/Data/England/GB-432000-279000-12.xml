		<title>12Cathedral and Old Ruins.</title>
		<content> The new cathedral towers above the old
 ruins. Epstein's statue of St. Michael
 and Satan hangs outside. Engraved     
 glass doors lead into the cathedral   
 which has an airy atmosphere. To the  
 right are beautiful coloured glass    
 windows. There is a sacred boulder of 
 rock, imported from Bethlehem.        
 A corridor leads to a circular room   
 with a great model of the Crown of    
 Thorns which hangs around a giant     
 cross. Small stools are around it.    
 There is an ernormous tapestry by     
 Sutherland , much bigger than you can 
 imagine, at the East End. The ceiling 
 is so high you have to bend your neck 
 right back to see the top. There are  
 holograms which look as though the    
 picture is coming out towards you. The
 ruins are the walls, tower and spire  
 of the old cathedral.
