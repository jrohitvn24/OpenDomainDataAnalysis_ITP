		<title>14A CHURCHILL TEENAGER</title>
		<content>  I have lived in Churchill all my life
 of 17 years.   When I was 3 I attended
 Playgroup until I was 5 when I joined 
 the Primary School here which has now 
 closed. Aged 11 I went to Chipping    
 Norton Secondary School.   I was a    
 member of Churchill Brownies and then 
 went to Kingham Guides as there were  
 none in Churchill.                    
  Churchill is not exciting for young  
 people;  it is a small village with a 
 high proportion of elderly people.    
 There are not enough teenagers to     
 support Youth activities.   We have no
 shop, only a sub-Post office, a pub   
 and a garage.   Public transport is   
 limited, so one needs a car.          
  I am now in full-time education on a 
 catering course at Banbury Tech.      
 When it finishes I will have to leave 
 the village to find employment as I   
 doubt if there will be any here.      </content>
