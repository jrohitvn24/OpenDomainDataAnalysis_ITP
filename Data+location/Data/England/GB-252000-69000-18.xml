		<content>  The area covered by the grid contains
 great physical contrasts. Peek Hill   
 and Sharpitor display the wild        
 tussocky appearance typical of the    
 western side of Dartmoor - some ferns 
 but little or no heather.             
   The southern slopes are covered by  
 forestry commission woodlands sweeping
 down to Burrator reservoir. The       
 northern slopes carry on them the     
 Yelverton-princetown road (B3212),    
 from which both the disused railway   
 and the bronze age hut circles near   
 Leeden Tor can be seen.               
  Walkhampton Church  is quite separate
 fom the village but dominates it from 
 its hill. Walkhampton lies in a little
 saucer, separated from the Walkham    
 valley by a miniature gorge.          
  The Walkham valley is deep and       
 remote, with very narrow lanes and    
 patches of mossy, rock strewn woods.  </content>
