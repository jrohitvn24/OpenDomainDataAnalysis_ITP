		<title>01General Description of Area</title>
		<content>    This is an industrialised area     
 which contains two major oil          
 refineries. One of these is owned by  
 Shell and the other by Mobil. These   
 refineries are supplied by tankers    
 which dock at one of the sixteen      
 jetties which are reached by sailing  
 up the Thames.                        
    The Shell refinery is in two parts,
 Shellhaven and Thameshaven.The area   
 called Shellhaven gets its name not   
 from the company but from the shell   
 bar whuch protects the entrance to the
 creek by which it stands.             
    The Mobil refinery occupies the    
 site of the old village of Coryton and
 so retains this name.                 
   The main access route is the A1014, 
 but direct access to the refineries   
 cannot be gained.                     
   At GR7382, some pasture is to be    
 found North of the A1014.             </content>
