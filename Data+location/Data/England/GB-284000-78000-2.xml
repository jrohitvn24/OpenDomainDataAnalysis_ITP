		<title>02Changes in Chudleigh</title>
		<content> We interviewed Bob Taylor, a lifelong 
 resident of Chudleigh who recalled    
 some of the changes since his boyhood 
 55+ years ago.  When he was a child   
 visitors were taken to Chudleigh      
 Rocks, a series of caves and stories  
 were told about the place where       
 ancient Britons lived.  There used to 
 be a stone wall around Ugbrooke Park  
 which was an old Iron Age or Roman    
 fort.  Bishop Lacy was the last bishop
 of Exeter resident in Chudleigh who   
 lived at the Bishop's Palace near     
 Chudleigh Rocks at Palace Farm.       
    When Bob was a child of 5 or 6     
 there were 6 slaughterhouses in       
 Chudleigh where each butcher          
 slaughtered his own animals.          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
