 it owned by{Lord Cowdray}and belonging
 to the{Paddockhurst Estate. The London
{to Brighton}railway runs though the W.
 side of the block, with the entrance  
 to the{Balcombe tunnel}to the south.  
 The{M 23}cuts across the north west   
 corner. There are 3roads, the{Balcombe
{Rd.}going from Pound  Hill, Crawley to
 Balcombe. Off to the west is the{High 
{Street}which goes to Handcross,and to 
 the east{Paddockhurst Rd}which goes   
 past{Worth School}to Turners Hill.    
 There is also a private school called 
{Worth School}with land that is let out
 to a farmer. On the corner of the     
 Balcombe Rd and the Paddockhurst Rd is
 a pub, the{Cowdray Arms.}In the N.W,  
 corner is part of{Tilgate Park}with a
