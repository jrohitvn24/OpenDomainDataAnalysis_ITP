		<content>   The{roads}in our area are very{busy 
 with{traffic.} The{lollipop lady}does 
 her best, but people who are driving  
 don't always take notice.             
   There aren't enough{signs}near the  
 roads, and car drivers go very{fast}on
 the main roads.                       
   The roads are flat in some places   
 and hilly in others. They are very old
 and are the cause of many{accidents,  
 some very serious.                    
   There have been a lot of accidents  
 in our area, like breaking legs, and  
 one boy is now in a wheelchair for the
 rest of his life.                     
   The{condition}of the roads seems    
 very bad to me. There are lots of     
 brake marks, which mean people drive  
 too fast.                             
   There is a main road close to our   
 school and some children from our     
 school have been in accidents.        </content>
