		<title>19Totternhoe Farms</title>
		<content> There are seven farms around the      
 village.  They vary in size from very 
 small to large.                       
 The largest one belongs to Mr.        
 Linney.The farm-house is across the   
 road from the school and has a        
 thatched roof.  The farm includes many
 fields which stretch from the village 
 up towards Dunstable.  Mr. Linney has 
 been a farmer for many years.  He     
 grows all sorts of crops including    
 wheat, barley and oil seed rape.  This
 turns the country-side yellow in the  
 early Summer.  He also keeps some     
 animals including cows and sheep.  The
 latter sometimes stray through a stile
 and into the school grounds.          
 He owns tractors and other farm       
 machinery which can be seen out on the
 roads at times.  He has several large 
 barns and silos for storage.
