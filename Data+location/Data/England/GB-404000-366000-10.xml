		<content>In the seventies there were 50,000     
vegetarians, now there are 1.5 million,
probrably about 95% of vegetarians are 
put off by the cruelty to animals and  
5% by health considerations. Recipes ar
getting more international; People a   
century ago would never have thought of
cooking lasagne or spaghetti.          
Junk Food (e.g. chips) is more popular.
Sunday lunches are going out partly    
because of vegetarianism and partly    
because of the time and effort         
involved.       Sausage Surprise
