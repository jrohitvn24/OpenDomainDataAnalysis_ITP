		<content> We wanted to look at the different    
 forms of transport in our district.   
 Motor cars are the chief form of      
 transport within the U.K..70 m.p.h. is
 the fastest speed permitted. We did a 
 traffic count on a nice sunny day at  
 2.15 p.m.on July 9th 1985, near to the
 traffic lights on the A38. We counted 
 for ten minutes. Counting in both     
 directions there were 67 cars, 3 moter
 cycles, 0 coaches or buses 11 lories  
 and 7 vans, totalling 88 vehicles.    
 Most of the lorries were transporting 
 building materials, including stone   
 from the local quarries.              
          We surveyed all 11 year old  
 children in our district attending    
 Avon primary schools to discover the  
 number of cars in each household. 1   
 household had 5 cars and 2 had 4 cars.
 4 households had 3 cars. 26 households
 had 2 cars and 5 had 1 car.           </content>
