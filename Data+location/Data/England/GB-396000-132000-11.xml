		<title>11WILD ANIMALS IN CHILMARK</title>
		<content>{Roe Deer}are commonly seen around the 
 villages. They come at first light and
 at dusk to graze in grass and         
 cornfields.{Hares}are occasionally    
 seen but are becoming rare due to     
 monoculture of grass for hay and      
 silage They like rough pastures and   
 stay in a grass nest or form most of  
 the day.{Foxes}prowl round at night   
 hunting for mice and birds and will   
 kill chickens unless these are sec_   
 urely housed.{Hedgehogs}live in our   
 gardens and eat slugs and snails.     
 Moles dig tunnels in the fields and   
 throw up earth mounds as they hunt    
 for worms.{Rats}are a pest as they eat
 stored corn and vegetables. Sometimes 
 they have to be poisoned. We also have
 house and garden{mice, badgers}in the 
 woods,{stoats}and{weasels, grey       
{squirrels}and a few{rabbits.
