 Our school is called {Clanfield       
{Petersgate County First School.}It was
 built 8 years ago.                    
 The grounds measure approximately 100 
 metres X 150 metres. There are places 
 to park 23 cars in the car park.      
 The building is an open-plan design.  
 There are 7 teaching areas, 3 in lower
 school wing and 4 in top school wing. 
 There is a hall connecting the two    
 wings that is also used as a dining   
 area. There is a kitchen but meals are
 no longer cooked on the premises but  
 brought from Emsworth.                
 There is a 'wet' area and a 'quiet'   
 area connected to each teaching area. 
 Each teaching area has cloakroom      
 facilities. There is also a music     
 studio, a computer room, a television 
 room, an office for the secretary and 
 another for the headteacher.          </content>
