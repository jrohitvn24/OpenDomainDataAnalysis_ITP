We went inside the church, it was a    
small room measuring 42ft by 14ft. It  
isuilt of stone supported by brick     
buttresses,two of them were built in   
the fifteenth century.It has a wooden  
turret on the West side which contains 
a bell. The bell has an inscription    
which says PETROS DEVESTON ME FECIT    
which indicates that there was a church
on the site in 1347.  However, the     
present church was built in 1540 out of
the ruins of Snelshall Priory.  In 1960
new roof was put on the church.  It was
noted that the wood in the old church  
was Deal.  The walls in the church have
pinkish wash on them and the eight     
mullioned windows are white.  In the   
North wall is a small alcove and there 
are traces of a door.
