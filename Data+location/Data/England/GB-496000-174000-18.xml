		<title>18CHURCH VERGER</title>
		<content> At Old Windsor Parish church Mrs.     
 Violet Baker has been the verger for  
 32 years and in 1985 attended her     
 434th wedding;she wears a special hat 
 and gown for her work.Christenings and
 weddings are her favourite services;  
 she finds that modern brides prefer   
 the old-fashioned service.            
 Her main job in the church is to put  
 out hymn books for services,make sure 
 the church is tidy and assist at      
 services.                             
 This Summer(1985)she is travelling to 
 visit a church built by Bill Cody in  
 Wyoming,America.                      
 She thinks that 1985 will be          
 remembered for the continuing         
 changeability of English weather,wars 
 around the world and space flights.
