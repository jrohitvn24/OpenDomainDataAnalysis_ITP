		<content> 1985 Saw the tenth Longtown Gala which
 owes its inception to the Youth Club  
 Management Committee,who also organise
 the choice of the Gala Queen, from the
 membership of the Youth Club.The      
 centre-piece of the event is the      
 Parade of Children,in fancy dress and 
 of decorated floats,led by the bands  
 through the streets of Longtown.In    
 this year's gala there was the added  
 attraction of horses and riders,led by
 Lochinvar and his bride.Many local    
 people are involved in the planning   
 ,design,and construction of the floats
 .The vehicles on which they are       
 mounted are kindly loaned by local    
 firms,whose drivers also volunteer    
 their services free.In addition their 
 are many other organised activities,  
 such as,Tug O'War,Darts,Round The     
 Holme Race ,Clay-Pidgeon Shoot,Pool,
