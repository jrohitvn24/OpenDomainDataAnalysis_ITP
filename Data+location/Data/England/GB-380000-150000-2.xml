		<content>{ Beckington   desperately    needs   a
{by-pass.                              
  'When  we  go  to  school  we have to
 cross  the  main  road  but  next year
 there is going to be a by-pass and the
 road will be a lot less noisy.        
  'When  the  by-pass  is  made it will
 make the  village  happier and I  will
 walk to school on my own and walk home
 by myself'                            
{ 'Beckington is where I live. My house
{is very old. On Thursdays I go to cubs
{which is held in the village hall.    
{ Where  I  live  there   are  not  any
{children to  play with so I play  with
{my brother and sister. There is a main
{road outside  our  gates and I am  not
{allowed to go out of the gates. I like
{living  in Beckington but  not where I
{live at the  moment  because I have to
{cross  the  main  road  to  get to the
{other children.'                      </content>
