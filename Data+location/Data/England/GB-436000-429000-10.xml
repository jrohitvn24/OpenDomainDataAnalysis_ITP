		<title>10THE NEW ESTATE,SWILLINGTON.</title>
		<content> The building of the new estate began  
 in November 1982. The piece of land   
 used was previously the site of       
 Primrose Hill colliery and later      
 wasteland. The new estate was built by
 the council. It was built in three    
 sections.There are{sheltered bungalows
  3 and 5 bedroom{detached houses}and  
{flats.}In the middle of the new estate
 there is a{community centre}where     
 bingo is held every Friday night.     
 Every now and again they have coffee  
 mornings and jumble sales. There are  
 appoximately 220 buildings on the new 
 esate.Most people who live there think
 that the facilities around Swillington
 are very poor. A lot of the older     
 people said that they would like to   
 see a supermarket built on Astley     
 Lane. Some people think that the new  
 estate is planned very well as estates
 go but others think its like a maze.  </content>
