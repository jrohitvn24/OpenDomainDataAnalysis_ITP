		<content> We went to Red Post Garage.  They are 
 the only garage around that have a    
 Sun engine tuner.  It is a family     
 business and he wants to keep it.  He 
 can make a living but not a good one  
 but he enjoys the job.  Selling cars  
 is not the main business.  His main   
 business is M.O.T. and servicing so he
 has all the special equipment.  He    
 does up cars.  His hobby is camping   
 and running a canoeing club.  He keeps
 some sheep and he is a special        
 constable in his spare time and at    
 weekends. We enjoyed this visit very  
 much.
