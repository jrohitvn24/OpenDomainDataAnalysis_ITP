		<title>01THE MINSTERLEY AREA</title>
		<content> The area is mostly farmland &amp;forest.It
 has part of the Rea Valley with hills 
 to the South.The River Rea joins the  
 Severn in Shrewsbury.                 
                      One main road    
 runs through the bloc, the A488 from  
 Bishops Castle to Shrewsbury.         
       There are four small residential
 areas, the village of Minsterley,plus 
 a  corner of the much larger village  
 of Pontesbury,  &amp; the hamlets of Plox 
 Green &amp; Habberley.                    
       Three factories are in or around
 Minsterley, one producing animal      
 foods, another that processes meat,   
 mostly ox tongue, &amp; a large           
 creamery.Many  villagers have to      
 travel to their work either to        
 Shrewsbury, the nearest large town,or 
 even beyond.                          
       Focal points for social life are
 the churches, pubs,&amp; village hall.    </content>
