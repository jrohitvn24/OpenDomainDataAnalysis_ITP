		<content>   I don't like doctors waiting rooms. 
 We have to wait so long and everyone  
 is quiet and sad looking.  Last time I
 went to the doctor for a rash on my   
 tummy I had to have two medicines.    
 They were both lovely. I had to have  
 them three times a day and my rash    
 went away.                            
                                       
                                       
 The dentist I go to has a lovely      
 waiting room with green velvet seats  
 and a T.V. to watch and magazines to  
 read. There are toys in another room  
 for children to play with.  I go for a
 check up every six months.  If one is 
 bad I have to have a filling or have  
 one out.  I have gas to put me to     
 sleep, some people have an injection  
 of novacaine and I wouldn't like that.
