		<title>16A BOY'S DAY IN GRETTON</title>
		<content>                                       
    I am a boy of 12 and live on a farm
 just outside Cardington. I am going to
 tell you about a typical Saturday in  
 my life.                              
    Normally when I get up at 8.30a.m. 
 my dad has just come in from doing the
 milking. After breakfast I go outside 
 and scrape the muck up with the       
 tractor,then I bed the cubicles down  
 with straw so that the cows don't get 
 dirty.                                
    After dinner I help my dad to do   
 odd jobs. About 3 o'clock I sneak into
 the house to listen to the football.  
 At about 5 o'clock I fork out silage  
 to the cows. After tea I don't usually
 do anything special,except perhaps    
 watch T.V. I don't go to bed very     
 early!                                
                                       
                                       </content>
