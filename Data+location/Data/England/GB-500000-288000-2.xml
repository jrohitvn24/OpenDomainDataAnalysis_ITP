Glapthorn has no shops now apart from  
the pub but that is not really a shop  
but there is a Garden Centre.   The    
Bakers house has gone and the          
Wheelwrights has gone.   Glapthorn     
School is much bigger now.   The Chapel
that we talked about in Old Glapthorn  
has gone.    There was a Chapel but    
that went in the war.  Now the drains  
are much better.   There was no        
electricity before the war but there is
now.   The washing facilities are      
better now.   School times are         
different.   There have been about     
twenty houses built and most houses    
have been  been modernised.
