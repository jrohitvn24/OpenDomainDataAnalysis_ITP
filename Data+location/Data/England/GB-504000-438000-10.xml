		<title>10Housing in East Beverley</title>
		<content> The housing in the area is mostly     
 post-war.  The houses on Swinemoor    
 Estate are mainly semi-detached       
 private houses and terraced council   
 houses which are in blocks of four.   
 They are made mainly of brick.  There 
 are also other materials, tiles for   
 the roof, metal for the window frames,
 wood for the doors,glass for the      
 windows,cement to hold the bricks in  
 place and steel for the gutters.  They
 are mainly early post-war but some    
 low-rise flats and semi-detached      
 private houses have been built in the 
 last 3-15 years.  Many houses do not  
 have chimney pots because they have   
 central heating using gas or          
 electriity. Some houses without       
 central heating burn coal in an open  
 grate,they have chimney pots.
