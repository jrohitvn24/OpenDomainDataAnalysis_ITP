		<title>02Light Hall Farm, Solihull.</title>
		<content> The 240 acres of{Light Hall Farm}are  
 owned and worked by Mr. and Mrs.      
 C.D.Smalley and son. Only on Fridays  
 do they employ an extra hand. The     
 farmhouse, barn, "herringbone" milking
 parlour and winter cow shed are       
 situated close to{Dog Kennel Lane,    
{Shirley.}The land is divided into 17  
 fields. The inner six, in which can be
 found three ponds and a stream, are   
 used for grazing the 96 Fresian cows, 
 66 calves, a bull and several horses. 
 Thus the cows do not have far to      
 travel or roads to cross each milking 
 time. The remaining fields are used   
 for growing wheat or barley on a      
 rotational system and 4 are reserved  
 for growing animal fodder. To improve 
 efficiency machinery used includes 4  
 tractors, a combine harvester, grass  
 cutter, hay turner, fertilizer        
 spreader, cultivator and others.      </content>
