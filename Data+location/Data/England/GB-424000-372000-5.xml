		<content>     A house extension being built by a
 local builder was studied in the      
 course of construction. The two metre 
 deep concrete foundation was built on 
 solid rock. Fibre-glass filled a two  
 inch cavity between the two courses in
 the twelve- inch thick walls. The     
 work team included one skilled,one    
 semi-skilled, and one unskilled       
 worker. When finished, the extension  
 would contain a lounge, bedroom and   
 stairs. It was begun in April and was 
 expected to be finished in October.   
   { A housing survey was carried out, 
 including the part out of the D-block.
