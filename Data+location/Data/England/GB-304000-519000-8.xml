 In the garden there is a sun dial,and 
 a holly tree which is the same age as 
 the house itself.                     
 There is also a vine and a peach tree.
 Under the roots of the vine there was 
 buried a dead sheep.This is because in
 the old days it gave nourishment to   
 the tree.Occasionally bones from the  
 sheep appear at the surface.          
 The estate includes 575 acres of      
 farmland and 125 acres of woodland    
 making 700 acres in all.              
 This house is the nearest we have to a
 mansion in the area.
