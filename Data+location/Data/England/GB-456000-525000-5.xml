		<content> The children of Coatham C.E.Primary   
 School play a variety of games. It was
 noticed that the boys and girls in the
 Infants played together a lot. The    
 opposite happened with the Juniors.   
 Lines on the Junior playground are    
 used for many games such as  Tigs on  
 Lines and  Hopscotch.                 
                                       
 Queenie is a popular ball game with   
 the older children. The aim is to     
 throw the ball and hit somebody who   
 was playing. Once you are hit you then
 join up to throw the ball at others   
 playing the game. The game is over    
 when everyone is hit.
