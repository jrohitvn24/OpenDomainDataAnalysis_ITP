		<content> The ancient church of St Michael      
 towers over the village and the bells 
 cast closeby are rung every week.There
 are 160 on the Roll and on festivals  
 it is filled with some 300 people.    
 Prayer Book services prevail but the  
 ASB is popular. The Methodist Church  
 is shortly moving to a new building   
 combining church and youth centre.    
 Both churches have groups for study,  
 women and young people. The churches  
 share regular services, particularly  
 for national and local celebrations,  
 often outside on the Green. Christian 
 Aid and the annual fete are joint     
 affairs gathering much support from   
 the village generally. Many people,   
 even if not members, look to the      
 churches for family events such as    
 weddings and funerals. The Poors Gorse
 and other ancient charities have been 
 combined to provide fuel at Christmas </content>
