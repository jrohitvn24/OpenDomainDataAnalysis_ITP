		<content> Leighton/Linslade is close to the M1. 
 This enables many people to commute by
 car to places of work in the          
 surrounding areas, Bus services are   
 very poor, only one bus linking       
 Soulbury to Leighton on Tuesdays only.
 Traffic congestion is a major concern 
 for people in Leighton/Linslade. An   
 action group, TRAC, has been fighting 
 for a town by-pass for 9 years. More  
 than double the number of vehicles use
 the Leighton/Linslade bridge per      
 traffic lane than the M1. It is hoped 
 that the by-pass will be started next 
 year and then 58% of the traffic      
 should use it. However 2300 commercial
 vehicles will still be based in the   
 town. The haulage trade has flourished
 in the area hauling bricks, sand and  
 cement, 23 haulage companies being    
 based in the town.
