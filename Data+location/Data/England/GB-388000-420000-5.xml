		<title>05A Shawforth Farrier</title>
		<content>   Mr. C. Thompson has been a farrier  
 in Shawforth for 10-12 years. He      
 became a farrier because he was very  
 interested in horses. He has travelled
 as far away as North Wales shoeing    
 horses.                               
                                       
   He also likes being a farrier       
 because he enjoys working with hot    
 metal. Mr. Thompson makes his shoes by
 heating a piece of metal in a forge   
 and putting it over the anvil. He hits
 it with a hammer and bends it to the  
 correct shape.                        
                                       
   Next he puts holes in it for the    
 nails to go through. The shoe is then 
 plunged into cold water. If somebody  
 wants the shoe on hot he burns it onto
 the horse's hoof.                     
                                       
                                       </content>
