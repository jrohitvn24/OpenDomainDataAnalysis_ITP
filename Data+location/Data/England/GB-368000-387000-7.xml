		<title>07Manchester Ship Canal</title>
		<content> In{1896}the Manchester Ship Canal was 
 finished and it was opened by Queen   
 Victoria.The cotton merchants provided
 enough money to build it, but over the
 years it became cheaper to send the   
 cotton from{Liverpool to Manchester}by
 road,and finally they could buy it    
 more cheaply abroad,so the amount of  
 traffic has decreased. These days     
 there is only one ship which sails    
 down the canal and that is the        
 sewerage ship.The canal is now very   
 polluted and few fish can survive.The 
 builders said that the canal would    
 last for hundreds of years but that   
 will never happen as the{Manchester   
{Ship Canal Company}are thinking of    
 closing the canal by 1990.
