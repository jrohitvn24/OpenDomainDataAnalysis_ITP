		<title>16THE FARMS AROUND PONTESBURY</title>
		<content> The majority of farms are owner       
 occupied and farming has been in the  
 families for up to five generations.  
 Everyone enjoys farming in 1985       
 although they all work a minimum of 10
 hours each day and have little or no  
 hired help, except at harvest time.   
 All of the farmers use chemicals to   
 eradicate pests and the main problems 
 are insects, rodents and parasites on 
 both animals and crops.  The average  
 size of the fields is 20 acres and    
 there is only one pond for each 500   
 acres.  The hedgerows are generally   
 maintained with a flail mower although
 some are grown and then layed in the  
 traditional manner.  All the farmers  
 seem concerned about conserving       
 wildlife and either plant trees       
 regularly or leave areas of rough land
 untouched.                            
                                       </content>
