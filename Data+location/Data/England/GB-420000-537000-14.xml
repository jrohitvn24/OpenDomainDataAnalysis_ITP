		<title>14GOLF CLUB SECRETARY</title>
		<content> Brancepeth's 18 hole golf course was  
 once the scene of many top tournaments
 in the North of England.It was formed 
 in 1924 when the land bought from     
 McLaren's farm by the castle owner.The
 course follows the natural layout of  
 the land.As secretary, Mr.Carver lives
 at the club which has 550 members.    
 Nine employees work all the year and  
 temporary staff are taken on during   
 the busy March-October time. He       
 teaches novices and the club has many 
 visitors who pay Â£9.00 per round.     
 There is a small ravine on the course 
 and one day a storm washed away the   
 bridge leaving some golfers stranded. 
 Mr.Carver would like to see the course
 improved and despite the fact that    
 there is little to do in the village, 
 he would not like to move.
