		<content> On the 22nd of June a group from 4R   
 interviewed Mr and Mrs Jupp, who own  
 Walshams{Craft Shop.}The shop is in   
{Sun Street,}the main shopping street  
 in Waltham Abbey.                     
 The shop is very old - just over 200  
 years old. Previously, when Mrs Jupp's
 father owned it, it used to be a{sweet
 shop. Mr and Mrs Jupp changed it to a 
 craft shop because there were a lot of
 other sweet shops in the area.        
 At the back of the shop there is now a
 video shop, it used to be a stable    
 where Mrs Jupp's father kept a horse  
 and cart.                             
 Mrs Jupp said that the town had       
 changed a lot in the last 20 years. In
 particular the amount of traffic had  
 increased, although it was now fairly 
 peaceful outside the shop, because Sun
 Street has been{pedestrianised.
