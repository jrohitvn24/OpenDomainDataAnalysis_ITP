		<title>16WYCH WOOD</title>
		<content> Wych Wood is a private wood lying to  
 the south of Adlington estate.A small 
 brook called Red Brook flows across   
 part of the wood .This area is fairly 
 thickly wooded,the most common tree   
 being oak.Other examples are          
 ash,larch,alder,beech,sycamore,rowan  
 and yew.Beneath the tree cover is     
 bracken and grassland.Bluebells,red   
 campion,cranesbill,bramble and        
 foxgloves were also observed.The wood 
 contains a good deal of wildlife      
 including grey                        
 squirrel,fox,rabbit,tawny owl,jay and 
 common garden birds.                  
  The soil is mostly leaf mould beneath
 the trees,but the stream has cut down 
 into the clay subsoil.Around the      
 stream the land is rather swampy.     
  Local people stroll through the wood 
 often taking their dogs for walks.
