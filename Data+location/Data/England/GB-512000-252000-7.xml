 spiders,woodlice,ants,hoverfly,wasps, 
 greenfly,wasps,bees,earwigs and       
 froghoppers.Butterflies are not as    
 common as they used to be but you can 
 see plenty of Cabbage Whites.Small    
 Tortoishells,Red Admirals and Peacock 
 butterflies can also be seen in this  
 area.                                 
 Larger animals often spotted include  
 bats,hedgehogs(although lots get      
 killed by cars),foxes,frogs and toads,
 shrews and mice.Local farmers complain
 about the rabbits and we have         
 sometimes seen a hare running across  
 our school playingfield.In the few    
 wooded areas you can occasionally see 
 a deer.                               </content>
