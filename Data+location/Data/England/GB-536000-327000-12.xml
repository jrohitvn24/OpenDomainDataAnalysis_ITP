		<content> The village school at Holbeach        
 Hurn,St.Lukes,was closed in           
 1967.Primary school children are now  
 taken by bus to Holbeach Bank school 3
 miles away.Some go to Holbeach        
 St.Marks,Fleet Wood Lane or Holbeach  
 but they are not entitled to free     
 transport.At 11,depending on 11+      
 results,children transfer to the      
 George Farmer secondary modern school 
 in Holbeach,or the Boy's Grammar      
 school or Girl's High school in       
 Spalding.Free transport is provided   
 for these children.For the under 5's  
 there is a playgroup in the village   
 hall(the old primary school) on       
 Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.This  
 began in 1970.In July 1985 there were 
 25 children on roll.The cost is 50p   
 per session and the playgroup leader  
 is Mrs. Hazel Blyth.
