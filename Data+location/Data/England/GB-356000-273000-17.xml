		<title>17HELP FOR HEDGEHOGS_KNOWBURY</title>
		<content>     In 1981, a Councillor, who lives  
 in Knowbury, took an interest in      
{hedgehogs.}He decided to put ramps    
 into cattle grids, so that if         
 hedgehogs and small animals fell in,  
 they could escape. When news of{      
{hedgehog ramps}reached people, money  
 was sent to him at Knowbury House. It 
 couldn't be returned because none of  
 the letters were addressed. Other     
 causes couldn't benefit because it had
 been sent especially for hedgehogs.   
     So{The British Hedgehog           
{Preservation Society}was founded.     
 Nobody knows much about hedgehogs, so 
 some of the money went towards        
 research, which was done by a         
 professor in London. Now money is     
 raised for the society by selling     
 T-shirts, cuddly toys and hedgehog    
 flavoured crisps. The society has     
 donated Â£1,000+ to help the research. </content>
