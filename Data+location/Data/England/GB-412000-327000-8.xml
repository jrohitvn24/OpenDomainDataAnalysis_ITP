		<title>08Marchington Indust. Estate</title>
		<content> This recently opened industrial estate
 occupies the site of a former army    
 camp built in the 1940's. Although it 
 covers 72 acres (29 hectares) its     
 opening has made little impact on the 
 community.                            
                                       
 In addition to warehousing there are  
 many smaller units including one which
 produces printed circuit boards for   
 computers and another which repairs   
 mining cables.                        
                                       
 The site includes the largest single  
 site grain store in Europe, with grain
 worth several million pounds.         
                                       
                                       
 A walk around the now empty barracks  
 takes one back in time to the days    
 when they were a bustling community.
