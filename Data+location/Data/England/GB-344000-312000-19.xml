		<title>19A DAY IN THE LIFE OF LISA.</title>
		<content> A typical day for me would be to get  
 up at 7.30 a.m. and go down for       
 breakfast which consists of cereal,   
 toast and a cup of tea. After I have  
 washed and dressed it is usually 8.15 
 a.m. We start out for school at 8.30  
 a.m. School starts at 9.00 a.m.       
 Sometimes we have an assembly held by 
 one of the teachers or their class.   
 Some of the subjects we do at school  
 are maths, english, study, R.E.,      
 arithmetic and creative writing.      
 School finishes at 3.30 p.m. Some days
 there are after school activities for 
 example, gymnastics, netball, running,
 rounders, cricket and swimming. When I
 come home from school I change into   
 shorts or trousers and go out to play 
 with Catherine and other friends. One 
 game that we enjoy playing is         
 rounders.
