		<title>04MONT ORGUEIL CASTLE (3)</title>
		<content>    After the pay desk, in the 13th    
 century{Southern Tower,}we come into  
 the{Lower Ward.}On either side of this
 tower are slits in the walls, where   
 there would have been guards. To      
 strengthen these defences from the    
 south side a cannon was brought in    
 about 1462.                           
    Part-way up the 198 steps we come  
 to{Sir George de Carteret's Rampart,  
 where we can see his coat-of-arms     
 engraved on the great wall. Carrying  
 on up the main steps we come to an    
 arch with a notice saying that Prince 
 Albert visited the castle in 1846. On 
 up the steps we pass another arch,    
 with three coats-of-arms, those of    
 Queen Elizabeth 1 and the Paulets     
 (Governors of Jersey) above it. After 
{Queen Elizabeth's Gate,}built in 1593,
 we pass through{St. George's Tower,   
 built in the 13th century.            </content>
