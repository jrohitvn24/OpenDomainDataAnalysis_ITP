		<content>{HOME LIFE.}Most people live in private
 houses ranging from large farm houses 
 to detached and semi_detached houses  
 on the new estates.Older types of     
 houses are along the main roads and   
 near the town centre.People can rent  
 houses.Most houses are brick built    
 except the older wood and plaster     
 ones.Almost everyone in Coggeshall has
 a garden.Life is made easier by labour
 saving equipment, washing machines,   
 vacuum cleaners,foodmixers,irons,micro
 wave ovens,automatic kettles and      
 toasters. We have both electricty and 
 gas in the home.Beaumont House and    
 Prail Court are old peoples homes,    
 divided into individual flatlets with 
 community rooms. They have a warden   
 who is always there to supervise and  
 help the elderly people .Coggeshalls
