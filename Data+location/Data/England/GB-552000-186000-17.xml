		<content>      At the back of our playground    
 there are allotments.   These plots of
 land are used for many things like    
 planting vegetables, fruit and        
 sometimes flowers.   They use rods for
 measurement instead of metres.   One  
 rod equals nine feet.   Ten rods cost 
 seven pounds.   There are 49          
 allotments.                           
      Most people grow potatoes,       
 carrots, parsnips, leeks and tomatoes.
 One man keeps bees.   Some people     
 share a plot and all the gardeners    
 live locally.   They love keeping     
 their plots clean and tidy.   There is
 a small shop which sells tools, seeds 
 and peat.   Each day people are       
 working on the land and one man spends
 2 hours a day there.                  
      The allotments are surrounded by 
 houses.   In the centre it is like a  
 large field in the country.           </content>
