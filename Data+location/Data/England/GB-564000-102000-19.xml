		<title>19Holidays, the Pevensey area.</title>
		<content> Pevensey,Westham and Pevensey Bay are 
 very quiet during the winter months,  
 50% of the population is over         
 retirement age.The population is      
 doubled with summer visitors.The area 
 does not provide all the amusements   
 and amenities of a seaside town,being 
 a{small rural seaside resort,}this is 
 why it is popular with families with  
 young children.The area is also ideal 
 for those who want{a healthy outdoor  
{life}free from the noise and          
 congestion of large holiday resorts.  
 The land is open and there are well   
 kept public footpaths from which to   
 enjoy it.There is a{wealth of         
{historical interest}in the many old   
 buildings and links with the past.The 
 aim of the Local Councils is to       
 provide necessary public services,and 
 recreational facilities,but to        
 preserve the{rural athmosphere.       </content>
