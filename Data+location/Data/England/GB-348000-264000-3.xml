		<title>03  TRAFFIC SURVEY - B4361</title>
		<content> The B4361 is known as the old Ludlow  
 Road.It goes from Ludlow to           
 Leominster.We went on this road on a  
 lovely Monday afternoon to{count}     
{traffic}travelling between the two    
 towns.It was a perfect day for traffic
 spotting.This is what we saw - 62 cars
 , 9 vans, 2 lorries, 0 coaches or     
 buses, 1 bicycle and 5 pedestrians. Of
 the cars, 19 were red, 7 green, 11    
 blue, 3 yellow, 1 black, 6 white and  
 15 were other colours. We stayed by   
 the side of the road for one whole    
 hour. We think that a lot more traffic
 now uses the A49 which is a{main trunk
 road connecting South Wales with the  
 North West of England. This road      
 passes through the other side of our  
 Domesday Area. Another group are doing
 a traffic survey of that road.
