		<title>16TRAFFIC IN BUNGAY</title>
		<content>As Bungay is a small town, public      
transport is limited. There are direct 
services to                            
Earsham,Halesworth,Southwold,Harleston,
Beccles and Norwich.Connections have to
be made for Lowestoft,Ipswich,Great    
Yarmouth and Diss.                     
     Until 1984 Bungay centre has      
congested with heavy traffic, but in   
this year the long-awaited by-pass was 
completed.This now alleviates the      
problem.By considerably reducing       
traffic congestion,pollution and       
travellers unnecessary time and        
trouble.The by-pass has proved to be a 
great asset to Bungay.                 
     The decision to build the by-pass 
was made in 1980, the planning and     
building took about 4 years altogether.
It has opened 11 months ahead of       
schedule.
