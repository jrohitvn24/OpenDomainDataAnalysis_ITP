		<title>17SHOPPING AREAS</title>
		<content> This part of Workington does not have 
 many shops as it is largely a         
 residential area and industrial       
 region.The shops that do exist are    
 mainly found along the{main road}that 
 runs through the area.Here can be     
 found shops selling{convenience goods 
 such as bakers,grocers newsagents and 
 fish and chip shops.For more expensive
 items such as{consumer durables}the   
 people of this area have to travel to 
 the town centre of Workington which is
 about 1 mile away.                    
 The village of{Harrington}has it's own
 shops including a post                
 office,newsagents and small           
 supermarket.Again most of the shops   
 are found along the main road through 
 the village,this is so that the       
 shopkeepers can catch{passing trade}as
 well as the local trade.
