		<title>17BUCKNALL PARK AND CHURCH</title>
		<content>The park at Bucknall was opened in l953
and in 1973 Finney Gardens was added.  
It is popular with families because the
adults can play bowls,tennis,football  
and cricket and there is a playground  
and many animals for the children to   
see like ducks,birds,goats and pigs.   
Bucknall park makes a weekend in       
Bucknall more exciting.I(Charlotte     
Heath)think that all the money that has
gone into the park is worth the        
enjoyment that it gives.St Mary's      
Church Bucknall dates from 1856,but    
there has been a church on this site   
since the sixteenth century.Major      
repair work from 1981-4 has saved it   
from closure and the Manpower Services 
Commission have undertaken the clearing
of the vandalised churchyard.An average
of one hundred and twenty people attend
Sunday Services.Local people are       
pleased the church has been restored.  </content>
