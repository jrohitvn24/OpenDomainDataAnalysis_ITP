		<title>04FISHING IN ST. IVES.</title>
		<content>   St.Ives was traditionally a fishing 
 village,but the importance of fishing 
 has declined as tourism has increased.
  Recent changes have seen a{decline}in
 the number of small part-time         
 hand-lining{mackerel}boats. The larger
 boats with full-time crews(about{30   
 men in total) catch crawfish, lobster,
 monkfish, ray and turbot with{tangle  
 nets. Monofilament{gill-nets}are      
 used for pollock, ling and cod.{Pots  
 are used for crabs and lobsters.      
  Boat designs have changed to{smaller 
 faster craft with{powerful}engines to 
 reach the further fishing grounds more
 quickly.                              
  There two local fishmongers but most 
 is taken by lorry to be sold on the   
{market}at Newlyn.                     
  Some boats take{tourists}on fishing  
 trips and scenic trips to Seal Island.
