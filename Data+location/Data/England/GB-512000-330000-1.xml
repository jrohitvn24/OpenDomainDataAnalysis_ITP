		<title>01Land around Little Wisbeach</title>
		<content> All the land is used for arable       
 farming.  there are around ten farms  
 now in the block, and eleven houses.  
 the land is flat with only a few trees
 and very few hedges.  Several wide    
 drains which take the water away to   
 the forty foot drain to the east.     
 part of the Carr dyke drain which was 
 cut by he romans is still there.  Most
 of the people who live in the block   
 work on the land.  One farm is a      
 cereal plant breeding station.  One   
 farm yard is now a rabbit farm.  The  
 majority of the land is used for      
 growing barley, wheat, rape and sugar 
 beet.  Two farms are part daily are   
 arable.  About half the land is owned 
 by the crown, very little is rented,  
 and the remainder is owned by the     
 farmer.
