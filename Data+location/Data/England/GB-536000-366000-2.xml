		<title>02Hundleby Village.</title>
		<content>    Hundleby is a very ancient village;
 it's Nordic name suggests that it was 
 started in the ninth century a.d.     
 Hundleby is situated on the ridge way 
 of the Wolds and the north facing bank
 of the river Lymn which was probably  
 used as the water supply.             
    The buildings in the village are   
 varied in style as the old have been  
 pulled down to make way for the new.  
 There is now only one mud and stud    
 building with a thatched roof left    
 althouth there is no doubt that there 
 were many others.                     
    In the eighteenth century, a brick 
 pit was opened and many of the        
 buildings in the village were rebuilt 
 using home made bricks.               
    There are forty eight houses with  
 pantile roofs. The tiles were probably
 imported from Holland as ballast for  
 otherwise empty returning ships.      </content>
