The main items of news in the Dartford 
Reporter dated 1/6/1985 were about an  
armed robbery on a Post Office Van, and
about an old woman of 86 who was       
tricked out of 300 pounds by conmen.   
There was a major article about" The   
Fin and Kentish Maid" about a ceremony 
honouring some of the oldest human     
remains- over quarter of a million     
years old - which were found at        
Swanscombe near Dartford.              
The T.V. personality Magnus Magnusson  
unvailed a memorial tablet recalling   
the discovery of what used to be called
Swanscombe Man and which should now    
perhaps be called Swanscombe Woman.    
Other articles in the papers concerned:
Tributes made to a 78 year old

died on Saturday;And a choir visiting  
Dartford from the U.S.A.               </content>
