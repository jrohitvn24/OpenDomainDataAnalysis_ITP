 Batchelors Paper Mill is one of the   
 few mills in the country producing    
 flong for the newspaper industry.     
 They use high fibre paper such as     
 computer paper and make it into a pulp
 by adding wood pulp, Cal Flo and china
 clay. This is mixed with water in     
 beaters. They use about 50,000 gals.  
 of water a day which is recycled and  
 comes from the mill stream. The pulp  
 is dried on rollers and 14 layers make
 one sheet of flong.Fungicides are     
 added and the paper is then cut to    
 size and rolled to give a smooth      
 surface. The finished paper then goes 
 to the newspaper industry where it is 
 used to make the moulds for printing. 
 About 80% is sent to Africa and India 
 and the rest to Fleet Street, London.
