 We surveyed ninety people in the town 
 centre. From our results we found out 
 that many people did not use buses,   
 but most of those who did thought the 
 service was quite good.               
   Two thirds of the people interviewed
 both men and women drove cars. Most   
 thought the parking facilities were   
 good a few thought they could be      
 improved.                             
   Most people thought the roads could 
 be made safer, especially the double  
 mini roundabout in the town centre.   
 Almost everybody thought the          
 pedestrian  crossings could be made   
 safer. Many people thought there      
 should be a bypass built around       
 Dunstable.                            
   Most of the people didn't use taxis,
 those who did, did so regulary.
