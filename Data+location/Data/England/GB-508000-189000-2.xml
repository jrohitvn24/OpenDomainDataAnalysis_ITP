 in orthopaedic problems.It is         
 situated on the top of Haste          
 Hill,which is 300 feet above sea      
 level.It has an orchard.The open      
 air wards face south and provide a    
 magnificent view for patients.        
 Many school charities donate money to 
 the hospital to provide it with       
 expensive equipment.The hospital is   
 run mainly by Catholic nuns. The      
 hospital's object is summed up as; the
 prevention of crippling diseases, the 
 openair treatment of crippled children
 and adults, the after care treatment  
 and supervision of patients discharged
 from hospital, the training and       
 rehabilitation of the crippled, and   
 the provision of a training school for
 orthopaedic nurses. It was built in   
 Clapham in 1907 and moved to Haste    
 Hill in May 1912.                     </content>
