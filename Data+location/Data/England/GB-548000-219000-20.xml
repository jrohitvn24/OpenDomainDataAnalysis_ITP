		<content>{ICE CREAM AND ICE LOLLIES}is a game   
 where someone is 'it' and all the     
 others line up with their hands       
 joined.The person who is 'it' tells a 
 story. When they come to the words    
 'Ice cream and Ice lollies' the other 
 children all run away and the caller  
 tries to catch them. Anyone who is    
 caught stands by the wall. When four  
 are caught the storyteller touches the
 last one caught and then all are free 
 again.                                
 In the playground we also play{FISHES.
 You have to get into groups of no more
 than five. Your group has to have a   
 fish name like Jellyfish. Then you do 
 'Ip Dip'for someone to be Chaser. The 
 chaser chooses a group and they have  
 to run down to the other end of the   
 pitch without being caught. The last  
 one to be caught is 'it' for the next 
 round.                                </content>
