  The "Block" shows some parts of      
 Yorkshire where we live. From Scissett
 School to Wheatley Hill it is about 3 
 miles. To get to Cawthorne Park it is 
 about 11 miles from Scissett School.  
 Scissett Middle School was built in   
 about 1947, it covers 12 square       
 kilometres. Before, it was called     
 Skelmanthorpe Secondary  School. At   
 Scissett Middle School there are about
 519 pupils. If you were driving from  
 Scissett to Clayton West it would take
 about 2 minutes, but if you drive from
 Scissett to Cannon Hall it would take 
 about 10 minutes. There is a First    
 School and a Middle School in         
 Scissett.
