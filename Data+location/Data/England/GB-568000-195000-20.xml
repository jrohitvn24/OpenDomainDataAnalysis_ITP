		<title>20 CAR  BREAKERS</title>
		<content>  One of the most remarkable sights    
 to be seen in such a tiny,quiet       
 village as{Ramsden Heath}is the sight 
 of large lorries,laden with the{      
{wreckage}of motor cars,travelling     
 slowly down the main street.Not too   
 strange perhaps,until they turn into a
 narrow drive in Downham Road,not 400  
 metres from the village triangle,to   
 return empty a few minutes later.The  
 reason is as simple as it is          
 surprising.There are five motor       
 breaking yards at the top of{Windsor  
 Road,where the surviving parts are    
 cannibalised for the use of private   
 motorists.So many parts are available 
 that Ramsden Heath is known all over  
 the county of Essex as{the}place to go
 for second hand spare parts for any   
 make of car,even the less common      
 models.                               
                                       </content>
