		<title>03Getting up on a school day</title>
		<content> At 7.30 I get up but sometimes I get  
 up a bit later. I have an alarm clock 
 to wake me up, but most mornings I    
 wake up before it rings, then I open  
 my curtains and get dressed and brush 
 my hair. I go downstairs for my       
 breakfast; for breakfast I have       
 different cereals like Start,         
 Frosties, Rice Krispies, Cornflakes,  
 Coco Pops or Weetabix.  Then I have   
 two pieces of toast and a cup of      
 coffee.                               
 At 8.00 my dad takes my sister to the 
 bus stop to catch the coach for       
 school.  I go upstairs to wash and    
 clean my teeth with Macleans          
 toothpaste.  Then I go into my bedroom
 and make my bed which is quite easy   
 because it is a quilt.  Then I go     
 downstairs and pack my bag for school.
