		<title>07Farming in Ravensthorpe.</title>
		<content>In Ravensthorpe today there are only 5 
farmers with another 5 men employed on 
the land.Mr.Foss is typical,farming l75
acres with his wife all within a mile  
of the farmhouse.8O acres are arable   
growing barley,wheat,oil seed rape,oats
field beans or peas.95 acres are grass 
supporting l2O ewes and 68 beef cattle 
2O being inside.This year 23O lambs    
were born.All produce is sold to local 
markets or buyers.What is grown is     
heavily influenced by the EEC subsidy- 
a source of much discussion by farmers 
and consumers.Two 75hp tractors with   
many attachments,a combine and a blown 
air corn drier dispense with the need  
for hired labour.Farming costs are high
with land at 2OOO pounds/acre,         
fertiliser l6O pounds/ton,animal feed  
l4O pounds/ton.Barley will sell at 93  
pounds/ton,milling wheat ll5 pounds and
sheep 4O pounds per 2O kg.             </content>
