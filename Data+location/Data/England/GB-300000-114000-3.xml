		<title>03LIVING IN UPLOWMAN</title>
		<content> I like living in the country because  
 you can go for quiet walks,ride horses
 and see more flowers and insects than 
 in the town.I do not like living in   
 the country because you might have to 
 travel to do the shopping and you     
 might be lonely.The schools in the    
 town seem so much bigger,there for    
 they have more teachers to teach the  
 children.                             
 On the second Saturday of July there  
 is usually a show at Uplowman.At this 
 show there is a gymkhana,show jumping,
 clay pigeon shooting,dog show,a goat  
 show and also there are classes to    
 enter for children and adults and and 
 also there are refreshments,to get in 
 it costs i 15p for children and 30p   
 for adults that is if you are not     
 entering anything,it lasts a day.
