		<content>       The Research Team were kindly   
 granted an interview by Sir Leonard   
 and Lady Redshaw, two well known      
 people who have devoted their lives to
 service to industry and other public  
 callings. The Team being invited into 
 their residence, "Bankfield", asked a 
 number of personal questions which    
 began with Lady Redshaw being asked   
 what she thought of life in the       
 district, to which she replied:"It    
 suits me admirably. Having originally 
 resided in London it was quite a      
 move." She also added that she had    
 lived in the house for thirty years   
 and loved every moment of it and      
 indeed the district in general. Sir   
 Leonard's answer to the same question 
 was:"Good,very good. It is an ideal   
 place, comparatively quiet and        
 satisfies all our requirements."
