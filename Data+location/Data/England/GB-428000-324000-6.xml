		<title>06Ghosts</title>
		<content> Many people in this area believe in   
{Ghosts}or at least like to hear       
 ghost stories. However there are very 
 few stories about them.               
 It is said that an apparition of a    
 coach drives up and down the Milton   
 Road and a phantom horse rider gallops
 around the countryside at Bretby.     
 Local folklore says that in the       
 grounds of the Vicarage at Repton,    
{St.Wiscott}and his devout followers   
 lies buried amoungst the burial mounds
 of the Vikings (which have been dug up
 recently).                            
 Some older inhabitants of Repton tell 
 of a wealthy woman who was haunted    
 for the rest of her life by the spirit
 of a servant she had unjustly         
 dismissed and who had subsequently    
 died of a broken heart.
