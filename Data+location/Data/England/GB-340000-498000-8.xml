		<title>08Farm visit - "Orrest Head"</title>
		<content> A typical farmer's day at Orrest Head 
 farm will depend on the time of year. 
 Throughout the year he will get up at 
 6.30 a.m. to milk the cows and then   
 have his breakfast at 8.30 a.m. In    
 spring, much of his day will be spent 
 with the new lambs. Most of them are  
 left outside and only those which are 
 ill or without a mother are brought in
 to the warmth of the farm. Once they  
 are strong enough, they rejoin the    
 flock.                                
 In summer, hay and silage making are  
 the main tasks; often he does not get 
 to bed until 1.0 a.m. In autumn he is 
 mainly concerned wth selling the lambs
 at the local market in Kendal, while  
 in winter, all the repair work around 
 the farm is undertaken, such as       
 mending the miles of drystone walls   
 and repairing broken fencing.
