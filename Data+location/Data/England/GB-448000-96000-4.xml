 which was built by Henry VIII.It is   
 now the H.Q. of one of the most famous
 yacht clubs in the world.Membership is

 Family.All are British males,although 
 there is a ladies lounge &amp; dining     
 room.Inside are lots of beautiful     
 things.In the 19th.century regattas   
 organised by members made Cowes a     
 world famous yachting-centre.The      
 tradition continues in 1985.The castle
 is now used for the start of many     
 races.Distinguished guests attend     
 dinner parties at the Squadron.During 
 Cowes Week there will be 80 guests    
 each evening.It is formal &amp; old       
 fashioned.The waitresses are paid a   
 standard rate,but enjoy meeting some  
 very interesting people.The R.Y.S. has
 played a unique part in the           
 development of Cowes.                 </content>
