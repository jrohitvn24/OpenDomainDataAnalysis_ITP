		<title>08Lanes: transport</title>
		<content> Along the lanes the four regular large
 vehicles are the daily milk-collecting
 lorry, our twice-daily primary        
 school bus and two buses for the      
 secondary pupils during the term-time.
 Otherwise tractors, cars, cyclists,   
 horses and pedestrians use the lanes, 
 being always aware that the unexpected
 may be round the next blind corner(of 
 which there are many). Part of the    
 lane system is the track of an old    
 Roman road to Gloucester.The lanes are
 damp much of the year and are liable  
 to flood.During snowy weather some of 
 the children managed to trudge up to 2
 miles to school while others were     
 given lifts on tractors. A variety of 
 wild flowers and birds can be seen    
 here including Little Owls, Kestrels  
 Martins, Swans and Geese.
