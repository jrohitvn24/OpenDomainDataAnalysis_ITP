		<title>18Shopping in Royston</title>
		<content>   There is a variety of small shops   
 in Royston and one supermarket.       
   The main shopping street is the High
 Street,which has some old buildings   
 and fairly narrow pavements.It is open
 to traffic.There are two small        
 pedestrian precincts with quite modern
 shops.The open air market is held     
 every Wednesday and Saturday.There are
 food shops and non-food shops.        
   We did a survey in which we asked 90
 families about their shopping.Most    
 people said they could buy fresh food 
 without difficulty,but that they      
 travelled to Cambridge,Letchworth or  
 Stevenage to buy clothes,shoes,freezer
 food or household goods.Royston was   
 only rated a 'fair'shopping centre.   
 A number of people wished the town had
 more department stores.               
   Most people use a car for shopping  
 and found parking difficult.          </content>
