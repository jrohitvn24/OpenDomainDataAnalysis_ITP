		<content> There are three rivers running through
 Braintree. The Blackwater, Pant and   
 Brain. The river Pant becomes the     
 Blackwater once it has passed Convent 
 Lane. The river Brain eventually joins
 the Blackwater before it reaches      
 Maldon and its mouth at Bradwell.     
 The rivers are still relatively small 
 as they pass through Braintree and are
 attractive with unaltered courses and 
 natural banks and vegetation.         
 There are footpaths along most of the 
 lengths of the rivers. Some are tarmac
 to provide easy access for everyone.  
 Along the Blackwater Willow, Oak,     
 Hawthorn, Sloe, Hazel and Dogrose were
 spotted. A variety of wild flowers    
 were found Cows Parsely, Mulen, Wild  
 parsnip, Comfrey, Mouse eared         
 chickweed, Curled Dock and Ragged     
 Robin.
