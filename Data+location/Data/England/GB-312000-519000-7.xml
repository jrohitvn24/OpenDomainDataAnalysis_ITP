		<content> There are no schools in this area.    
 Between the ages of 4-11 most children
 go to school in the nearby village of 
 Lorton. From the age of 11 unitl      
 either 16 or 18, when they leave      
 school, the children go mainly to     
 Derwent Senior Secondary School in    
 Cockermouth. There are eight children 
 of school age, two between 4 and 11   
 years who go to Lorton, and four      
 between 11 and 18 who go to Derwent.  
 There are no special facillities in   
 the area for the per-school children  
 because of the very small numbers.    
 However for these young children there
 is a Mothers and Toddlers group in    
 Lorton. Most toddlers go between the  
 ages of 2 and 4 years. For the older  
 children there is a youth club, again 
 in Lorton, for 11 years upwards and   
 most of the children in the area go to
 this club.                            </content>
