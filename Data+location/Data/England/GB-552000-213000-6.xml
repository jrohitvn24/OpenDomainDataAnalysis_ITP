		<title>06Lea Hall - Hatfield Heath</title>
		<content> Lea Hall is one of several listed     
 buildings in the area and it was built
 in 1590.  It was named after a man    
 called John de la Lea which means John
 of the Lea.  The grounds extend for 12
 acres and the house is surrounded by a
 moat which is as much as 12 feet deep 
 in places.  During World War II,      
 Italian prisoners from a nearby camp  
 cleaned it out.  When the present     
 owners moved into Lea Hall, five years
 ago the bridges going over the moat   
 were old and unsafe so they had to be 
 replaced and new ones built.  An      
 archway into Lea Hall has been        
 brought from Hull and also an         
 old church window frame has been      
 brought from Yorkshire and placed in  
 the grounds.  A small group of        
 children from our school visited Lea  
 Hall and spent an enjoyable afternoon 
 there.                                </content>
