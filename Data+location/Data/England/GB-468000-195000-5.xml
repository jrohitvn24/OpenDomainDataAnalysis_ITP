		<content>The main religion in our block is      
Church of England, although there are  
some Quakers.                          
There are two churches, one in Lewknor 
which is called St.Margaret's and one  
in Pyrton. There is also a private one 
belonging to Shirburn Castle.          
The vicar of Lewknor church,           
Mr.Jefferyes,  has to look             
after five other Parishes (North of our
area) as well. He takes groups in      
school as our school is Church of      
England Controlled.                    
Both churches are built of local flint 
with stone dressings. St.Margaret's has
foundations which date back to the     
Norman times (1146).
