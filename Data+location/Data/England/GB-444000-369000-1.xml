		<content> The survey area divides{physically    
 into 2 parts. In the eastern quarter  
 is the crest of an escarpment at a    
 height of about 180m. The land slopes 
 fairly steeply westwards into the     
 valley of the river Doe Lea where the 
 land is around 70-100m. There are 3   
 main types of{land use;}agriculture   
 (60%), settlement(25%) and industry   
 (15%). The main{settlement}is in the  
 eastern part of the area centred      
 around Bolsover, with part of the     
 village of Duckmanton in the north    
 western corner of the area. Bolsover  
 has developed around the site of a    
{castle}which dates from Norman times. 
 The main{industries}are{coal mining   
 and{chemical manufacturing,}both      
 situated in the northern part of the  
 valley. The main road and old railway 
 follow an east/west route across the  
 area.                                 </content>
