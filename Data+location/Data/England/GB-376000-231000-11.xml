		<title>11Pendock School saved</title>
		<content> In September 1983 the Local Education 
 Authority were planning to close the  
 school.They went round asking         
 questions.In January 1984 everyone had
 some big posters on their car windows 
 saying"I am supporting Pendock        
 School".The people of Pendock School  
 had a big folder of why they should   
 keep the school open.The Parents went 
 round all the houses in Pendock and   
 Eldersfield Marsh and on the road up  
 to Ledbury.They knocked on every door 
 to see whether or not more children   
 will be coming to the school.The      
 parents did a five year graph.If the  
 school did close down then we would   
 have to go to school on a taxi and    
 they are very dangerous roads and the 
 parents didn't like that.In the end   
 the school stayed open because the    
 parents found out that there were a   
 lot more children that were coming.   </content>
