		<title>13THREE COUNTIES SHOW,MALVERN</title>
		<content> The Three Counties Show is so called  
 because of the three counties,        
 Herefordshire,Worcestershire and      
 Gloucestershire.It is held in Malvern 
 which is 5 miles away from Cradley    
 where we live.Dad gave my sister and  
 me Â£5 to share and a programme each.  
 Then we all split up deciding to meet 
 at the arena for lunch at 12.00a.m.   
 We went to the food stall first       
 because there were lots of free       
 samples.We then went looking around   
 the colourful stands,selling things   
 like jewellry,fruit,vegetables,toys,  
 ice creams and horse-riding things.   
 My friend was going to buy a whip but 
 she did not bother.I bought a pair of 
 pink earrings.While we were eating our
 lunch there was horse jumping and     
 trotting going on.We went around to   
 the stables behind the arena.There    
 were lots of horses and ponies.       </content>
