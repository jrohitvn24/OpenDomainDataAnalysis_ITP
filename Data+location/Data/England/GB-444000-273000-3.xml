		<title>03The houses we live in</title>
		<content> The houses in the area are situated   
 mainly in the village of Long Lawford;
 they are mainly terraced and          
 semi-detached.I live in a             
 semi-detached house.Years ago,the four
 main streets were Chapel Street,Main  
 Street,School Street and Cross Street 
 and the housing was situated along    
 these streets which were formed in the
 shape of a cross.All the other streets
 have been added on in recent years,for
 instance, where an old caravan site   
 used to be now has all new houses on  
 it making new streets called Thomas   
 Way,Round Avenue and Hirst Close. In  
 Main Street, near to the village      
 church, more houses are being built   
 which will lead into Thomas Way.Much  
 of the recent development that has    
 taken place has been for old people   
 and these houses have a warden called 
 Dot who looks after them.             </content>
