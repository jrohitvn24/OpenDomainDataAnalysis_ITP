		<content> Brook Street.                         
    Most of the residents in this area 
 have lived here all their lives and   
 their parents before them. Apart from 
 those living on farms about 50 houses 
 and 130 people have their address     
 "Brook Street", Cuckfield.  This is   
 not a street but a road 4 miles long  
 from Whitemans Green to Balcombe.     
  Formerly a country lane, now a busy  
 thoroughfare affording access to      
 Crawley and Gatwick Airport. The only 
 industrial premises is a garage run by
 3 brothers, grandsons of Mr. Smith who
 had a forge on this site before World 
 War I. These brothers are all self-   
 employed and as well as repairing     
 cars and testing them for the M.O.T.  
 certificate, they maintain farm       
 machinery which can also be hired from
 them. They all live locally and would 
 not wish to move.                     </content>
