		<title>06AUSTIN ROVER CAR BODY PLANT</title>
		<content> The{Austin Rover}car body factory     
 forms the backbone of the industry    
 in{Stratton St Margaret.}It was       
 opened in 1955 on a 54 hectare site   
 but now covers a much larger area.    
 In 1975 it employed over 5,500 men but
 now it only employs 2,500 men; this is
 due to modern technology i.e.robots,  
 computers and a more automated        
 production line.Currently it is       
 building parts for the following cars:
 Metro, Maestro, Montego and all the   
 Jaguar range.It has been known to make
 panels for Rolls Royce.The plant makes
 its own tools i.e.dyes and moulds.It  
 is capable of producing over 666,000  
 panels per week. Heavy lorries        
 carrying body panels are a familiar   
 sight on our local roads.             
 The plant is also involved with the   
 new Japanese{Honda}factory being built
 at{South Marston.                     </content>
