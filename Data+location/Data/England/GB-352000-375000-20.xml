		<content>  Sunday schools were a regular part of
 life in those days. Good attendance   
 was rewarded by the gift of a book,   
 this quite often being the only source
 of book ownership.                    
  Local industry was a jam works at    
 Sandfields and a bone works at        
 Frodsham Bridge. Old bones were       
 treated to produce manure Wages were  
 low. In 1918 when Mr. Greenleaves     
 started in the bank, he considered    
 fifteen shillings (Â£0.75) a reasonable
 wage for a week's work.
