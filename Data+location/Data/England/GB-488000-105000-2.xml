		<title>02BOXGROVE - THE SCHOOL</title>
		<content> was about 1000 and even more so since 
 1930 when the population was 1300.    
{BOXGROVE C. OF E. SCHOOL.}The School  
 was opened in 1741 when the Countess  
 of Derby gave some money to build a   
 School, a house for the headmaster and
 12 Almshouses for the old ladies from 
 Boxgrove, Lavant and Tangmere.  Before
 that time only children of rich people
 had any school education but Mary the 
 Countess of Derby said that the poor  
 children had to have education. On the
 wall of the original Schoolhouse is an
 engraved notice which says,{"These    
{buildings were erected and Endowed by 
{the right honourable Mary Countefs    
{Dowager of Derby Daughter and heirefs 
{of Sir William Morley late of Halnaker
{Knight of the moft honourable order of
{ye Bath."}Like the village the number 
 of children at the school has dropped 
 from 190 in 1950, to 33 in 1985.      </content>
