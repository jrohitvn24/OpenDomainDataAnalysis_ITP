		<content> sixth form courses.There are about    
 three hairdressers in Cleator Moor.   
 They are Diane's Boutique,Curly Tops  
 and Carol's.You would have to go to   
 Whitehaven or to the Clinic to see    
 about your teeth.You can not have     
 hospital treatment in Cleator Moor but
 you can go to the Doctors.There are   
 good services of buses to Ennerdale   
 Whitehaven and Egremont from Cleator  
 Moor.The nearest  trains are in       
 Whitehaven. Road egress from the area 
 isn't very good. Roads are winding and
 narrow and the nearest access to the  
 motorway system is the M6 at Penrith.
