		<title>01Yealand Villages Today</title>
		<content>The name Yealand probably derives from 
the Anglo-Saxon "geah-land" or steep   
land. It is mentioned in the original  
Domesday Book as "Jaland". Above the   
villages there is a limestone hillside 
covered with deciduous and yew trees.  
Lower down there are fields of         
intensive grassland, some grazed by    
cows and sheep, others cut for silage  
and hay.                               
The adult population of Yealand is     
about 500 people. There are still a few
people in farming but most are retired 
or work outside the villages. We have  
a village shop, a pub and three        
churches - Roman Catholic, Anglican    
and a Quaker Meeting House. It is      
three miles to the nearest town        
called Carnforth where the older       
children go to school.
