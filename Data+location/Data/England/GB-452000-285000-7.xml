		<title>07TRANSPORT IN BITTESWELL.</title>
		<content> Our block is crossed by many small    
 roads which join up lots of small     
 villages in east Leicestershire.These 
 are mostly flat,but many of them are  
 impassable in heavy winter snow.      
 The M.1. runs through our block,and   
 the nearest junction is at            
 Lutterworth.It was the first BRITISH  
 motorway.                             
 There is also the main Leicester to   
 Rugby road which runs parallel to the 
 M.1.                                  
 The railway line which joins London   
 and the north runs through our block. 
 Many firms have set up on the eastern 
 edge of our block because it is easy  
 to reach other parts of Britain from  
 there.
