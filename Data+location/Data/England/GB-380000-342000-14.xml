		<content> Westlands Farm School used to be a    
farm called Balls Farm, with hay in    
fields up to chest height! Gallowstree 
Lane was a narrow, rough track from    
Thistleberry to Keele Road.            
 Where the swings are now used to be   
pig styes. Close to that was Hampton's 
Farm, which is now a scrap yard and    
what is Thistleberry House today was a 
Work House now the home for the        
elderly. (Workhouse : Home for the     
elderly and poor)                      
 Balls Farm delivered milk by horse and
cart from their dairy herd to houses   
where they ladled the milk in your     
jug. In those days, there was no Paris 
Avenue shops nor Paris Avenue just     
fields. The main games were marbles and
football which was played in the       
street. Younger children played tag and
Rally ho.
