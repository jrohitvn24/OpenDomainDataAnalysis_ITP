 living on the farm since              
 1921.Mr.Beatty has been a farmer for  
 about 40 years.Most of the buildings  
 in his yards have been up since       
 1700.He started building up his       
 equipment in the 1940's.              
 They first began taking Mr.Beatty's   
 land about 20 years ago when they     
 began to build a new estate called the
 Mount Pleasant Estate.They have       
 recently put the M6 through the bottom
 parts of his land.                    
 Mr.Beatty grows wheat and barley at a 
 rate of 2 tons to the acre.He keeps   
 100 cows which he milks but also to   
 sell for beef at auction.

 amount of equipment he has and has    
 replaced most of his horses.His oldest
 tractor is 20 years old!
