		<content>There are four schools in our block,   
catering for a wide age range;a First  
(5-9years),a Comprehensive (11-18),a   
Convent School(fee-paying for boys up  
to 11 years, girls 11-18) and a school 
for special educational needs.The first
three schools all have a Roman Catholic
tradition. St.Austin First School,     
Kenilworth, has about 70 pupils        
organised in three classes. The        
buildings date from the 1890's         
following bequests from the sisters    
Amherst. The school catered for        
infants,juniors and seniors until 1959;
it became a first schoolin 1976. St.   
Joseph's Convent School was founded in 
Coventry in 1862 by the Sisters of     
Mercy.During World War 2 St.Joseph's   
was evacuated to Stoneleigh Abbey. The 
school moved to Crackley Hall in 1945.
