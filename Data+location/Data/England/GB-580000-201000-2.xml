		<content>   Farmland predominates in Cock Clarks
 and Purleigh. Farms range in size from
 350 acres to 3 acres, the smallest    
 commercial farm we encountered, as    
 well as there being many smallholdings
 from which families make their living.
 By far the most important farming is  
 arable crop production, for example,  
 the largest farm grows 100 acres of   
 wheat for flour production, 110 acres 
 of barley, 126 acres of wheat for     
 cattle and the rest, a mere 8 acres,  
 is designated rough grazing for       
 cattle.                               
   Most of the crops are sold locally  
 although some are exported as far as  
 China. One farmer reported having sent
 a ton of grain to Ethiopia during the 
 recent famine there.                  
   New Hall vineyard, one of the few in
 England, produces a variety of white  
 and rose wines. (See slide)           </content>
