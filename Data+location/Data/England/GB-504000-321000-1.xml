 Most of the local history is centred  
 round Grimsthorpe castle.It is still a
 square shape.It has towers,it is a    
 stone building,it has lots of         
 windows.It is surrounded by landscape 
 gardens,fields,woods and the lake.The 
 lake is stocked with fish and local   
 people say the odd tank or unexploded 
 bomb.From the upper storeys the owner 
 Baroness Willoughby de Eresby has seen
 all the area that we are studying.The 
 main room is the Vanburgh Hall.The    
 walls are lined with paintings.There  
 are statues in the hall too.The Castle
 is open to the public on the 28th July
 for the summer season.On Christmas Eve
 Lady Willoughby invites villagers to a
 carol service because she is staying  
 there with friends.There is a big log 
 fire burning.Drinks are served and    
 mince pies.                           </content>
