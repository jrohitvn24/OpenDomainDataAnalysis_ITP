		<content> There are 9 shops in Chew Magna.      
 Walkers Stores, at the top of the     
 village, is a small, friendly family  
 business selling groceries. The Mace  
 and the Co-op are small supermarkets. 
 They are at the bottom of the High    
 Street in the centre of the village.  
 Mr. Pearce has a butcher's shop.  The 
 Post Office, an attractive            
 stone-fronted building, doesn't just  
 post parcels. It sells baby things,   
 cosmetics, greetings cards  and in    
 winter it opens up a room which sells 
 Christmas things.  Just across the    
 road there used to be an Old Bakehouse
 but now it is a children's boutique   
 called Small Talk. Wellington Gallery 
 is a newsagents which also sells      
 ornaments, pictures and lampshades.   
 Fitzgerald's sells things for the home
 as well as wool and some clothes. West
 Midland Farmers sells farming goods.  </content>
