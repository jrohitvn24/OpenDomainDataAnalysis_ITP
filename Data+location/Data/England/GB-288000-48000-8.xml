 Coleton Fishacre is by the coast.The  
 house is surrounded by beautiful      
 gardens.There are lots of lovely walks
 along the coast created by the        
 National Trust as part of the Heritage
 Coastline Project.                    
 THE HOUSE                             
 The house used to be owned by the     
 D'oyle Carte family who organised the 
 Gilbert and Sullivan Operas.It was    
 built in 1926 of Dartmouth shale taken
 from the quarry next to the tea rooms 
 in the grounds.The house is now owned 
 by The National Trust and leased by   
 the Palmer family.                    
 THE GARDEN                            
 We met 7 experts in the garden,they   
 all took a group to teach us something
 to do with nature.I was in the        
 gardening group,the expert was called 
 Dick Taylor,the headgardener's husband</content>
