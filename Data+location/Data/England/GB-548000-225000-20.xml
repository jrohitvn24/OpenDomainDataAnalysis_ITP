 looked very nice. At 3 o'clock there  
 are lots of mums outside the school   
 gates to pick their children up.The   
 children are all coming out of        
 school.When they got home they start

 playing a game on the Computer.At 4   
 o'clock the children are watching     
 children's programmes on television at
 their homes.Some dads that came home  
 early are coming home now.It is now 5 
 o'clock,lots of girls are going to
