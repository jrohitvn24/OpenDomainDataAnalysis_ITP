		<content> Purley was,for almost 20 years, the   
 home of the famous sporting           
 artist,Cecil Aldin.The village was the
 H.Q. of the South Berkshire Hunt,and  
 Aldin moved there in 1913,when he     
 became master of the foxhounds.Aldin  
 was a leading newspaper illustrator   
 and poster artist,who specialised in  
 hunting scenes and dog illustrations. 
 Two of his dogs,"Cracker" and "Micky" 
 became famous animal models. A plaque 
 in Purley church commemorates the     
 death of Aldin's beloved son , Dudley,
  who fell in the First world war, aged
 19.There is a 'Cecil Aldin Drive' in  
 Purley ,and the barn in which Aldin   
 stabled horses, as purchasing officer 
 for the army in the first world war,  
 can still be seen in the grounds of { 
{Trenthams Civil Engineering Firm}.
