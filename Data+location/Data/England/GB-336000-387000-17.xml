		<content> It has  been said that the most famous
 pop  group  in   the   world  was  the
{"BEATLES". }One  of  their most famous
 members  attended  our  school, he was
 John  Lennon.   Many  Beatle fans from
 all  over  the  world, especially from
 the  United States of America and from
 Japan, come visiting our area.        
 The road signs in{"Penny Lane"}because
 of  their popularity  keep being taken
 by tourists. To prevent this happening
 the words are just painted on the bare
 brick  walls.                         
 In  the  locality other links with the
 Beatles' work include  a  coffee house
 called {"Sgt.Peppers Kitchen." }In the
 song{"Penny Lane"}the reference to the
 Bank Manager  refers  to  the  bank in
 Penny Lane.
