		<title>19A day in JH Ampleforth Coll.</title>
		<content>  At 7:30 we are woken in our          
 dormitories by  a monitor ringing a   
 handbell. Some may  already be up,    
 especially those in Extra Work. After 
 washing and dressing  we have Mass at 
 7:40 or prayers at 7:50. Breakfast at 
 8:00 is followed by bed inspections.  
  From 8:45 to 11:00 there are three 45
 minute periods, followed by a break   
 until 11:30. Two more lessons follow  
 until lunch. Lunch prep is from       
 1:30-2:00.                            
  Every afternoon there are games, such
 as Rugby or Cricket. Tea is at 4:00   
 which includes cakes on alternate     
 days. Lessons restart at 4:30, a 10   
 minute break at 5:45 followed by the  
 final lesson. At 6:30 we have prep    
 followed by optional Mass. Supper is  
 from 7:30 followed by valued free time
 before bed and prayers at 9:00.       
  Lights out are at 9:45.              </content>
