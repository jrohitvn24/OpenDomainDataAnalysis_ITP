		<content>The first Wesleyan Methodist services  
were held in a room over the bakehouse 
of a cottage in the village. As the    
congegation grew,a building was        
purchase and this is now used as a     
builders office and store room(Woodford
and Upfield) It is almost next door to 
the existing building. The site of the 
present chapel was purchased for 200   
pounds in 1882. The chapel was built in
1844, In 1976 it was redecorated and   
the ceiling lowered. In 1985 the roof  
was completely replaced. A service is  
held every Sunday at 3.00p.m. There is 
also a Sunday School which meets every 
two weeks. The minister is Rev. Barbara
Halstead who lives in Banbury. There   
are nine members of the church and     
seven members of the Sunday School.
