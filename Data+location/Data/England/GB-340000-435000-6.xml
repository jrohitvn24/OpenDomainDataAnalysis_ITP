		<title>06THISTLETON (GREENHALGH)</title>
		<content> This is a lovely village retaining    
 much of its original charm.  The aim  
 locally is to keep it as unspoiled as 
 possible.  The farms are built on the 
 roadside, intermingled with cottages. 
 The farm land lies to the rear of each
 farm.  One cottage built about 200    
 years ago is thatched.  The cottage is
 low, the roof has a long slope and the
 windows are very small.  Most of the  
 houses are built of handmade red      
 bricks.  Some retain their original   
 appearance whilst others have been    
 rendered and whitened.  Most of them  
 have slate roofs.  There are about    
 seventeen houses, four of which are   
 semi-detached.  Thistleton is a prime 
 example of a traditional Fylde        
 village.
