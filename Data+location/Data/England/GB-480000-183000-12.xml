    Monk's Barn circa A.D.1100 next to 
 the carpark(formerly the village pond)
 is still used for storing potatoes and
 social occasions.                     
   There is an excellently preserved   
 dovecote built by monks in 1306.      
 Alongside this is the tithe barn,now a
 private house.                        
   'Ye Olde Bell'dating from 1135 was  
 originally the guest house for the    
 monastery of Hurley.It is now an inn. 
 'The East Arms' is another inn.It was 
 built following the building of the   
 toll road(now a part of the A423) as a
 coaching inn.                         
   Formerly a part of Windsor Forest   
 Hurley gets its name from the HUR     
 meaning "good wood" and LEY meaning   
 meadow.
