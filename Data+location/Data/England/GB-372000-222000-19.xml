 Because our block has no shops or     
 other amenities most people who live  
 in this area travel by car. There is a
 bus service but in common with other  
 rural routes it is infrequent and     
 often only used as a last resource or 
 by those who have no other means of   
 transport. For the majority of        
 shopping for food and clothes most    
 people travel to Newent or            
 Gloucester.There are a selection of   
 shops including several supermarkets. 
 Living in the country entails doing   
 the shopping probably once a week     
 buying fresh and frozen food. There   
 are also several farm shops in the    
 area which sell a wide range of farm  
 produce at a reasonable price. It is  
 getting more common nowadays to have a
 freezer in the home in which food can 
 be stored for up to 3 months.         </content>
