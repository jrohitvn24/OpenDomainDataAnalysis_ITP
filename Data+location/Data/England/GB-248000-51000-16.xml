		<content>                                       
    The Plymstock Fire Station is one  
 of the many fire stations in Devon. It
 has one{fire engine}that cost Â£70,000,
 but more equipment must be bought.    
 This costs Â£15,000 making a total of  
 Â£85,000. During a period of 12 months 
 the fire station takes 118 fire calls 
 and 38 special service calls (cats out
 of trees,etc.,)                       
    There are 400 gallons of water in  
 the tank of the fire engine. Each     
 water hose is 75ft long.              
    The station is manned 24 hours a   
 day in four shifts. There are 6 men on
 each shift, just enough to go in one  
 fire engine. One is the driver, one is
 the dogs-body, one is in charge : the 
 rest just help to put out the fire.The
 nearby{police station}has two cars and
 reports that the{crimes}they deal with
 most are theft and drunkenness.       </content>
