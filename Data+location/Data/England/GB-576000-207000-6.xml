		<title>06LITTLE BADDOW CHICKEN FARM</title>
		<content> Spring Elms chicken farm is just      
 outside Little Baddow.It is a small   
 factory farm occupying 4 acres of     
 land.It is owned and run by the       
 Lambert family.The farm does not      
 produce eggs but buys its chicks at   
 one day old.The chicks are put into   
 specially heated sheds and are kept   
 with those of the same age.There are  
 about 20000 chickens in the farm at   
 any one time.When the chickens reach 6
 weeks old they are killed by          
 elecricution.They are then plucked    
 frozen and packed in boxes of 12 and  
 sold to local shops and eating        
 places.The farm has its own vehicles  
 which are fuelled from its own petrol 
 pump.In this type of farming not only 
 is the family employed but also       
 specialised workers are used for      
 killing and packing and one YTS person
 has been taken on.                    </content>
