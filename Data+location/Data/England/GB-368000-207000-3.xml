		<title>03HEALTH CARE AT AWRE</title>
		<content> HEALTH CARE AT AWRE IS SHARED BETWEEN 
 DR DUKES AT NEWNHAM AND DR HOLLAND AT 
 BLAKENEY. WE INTERVIEWED DR HOLLAND IN
 HIS SURGERY,WHICH USED TO BE BLAKENEY 
 POST OFFICE. THERE IS NO SURGERY AT   
 AWRE AND HIS PATIENTS THERE TRAVEL TWO
 MILES TO SEE HIM. HE RARELY GETS      
 CALLED OUT AT NIGHT;SUCH CALLS ARE    
 MOSTLY FROM MOTHERS WORRIED ABOUT     
 THEIR CHILDREN,AND THERE ARE AT       
 PRESENT NO INFANTS IN AWRE. HE        
 DESCRIBED HIS PATIENTS AT AWRE AS     
 HEALTHY FARMING STOCK WITH FEW SPECIAL
 HEALTH PROBLEMS. WE ASKED HIM IF THE  
 NUCLEAR STATION AT BERKELEY HAD CAUSED
 HEALTH PROBLEMS AT AWRE. HE ANSWERED  
 THAT NEARBY HAD BEEN 5 CASES OF CHILD 
 LEUKEMIA BUT NONE IN AWRE;IN HIS      
 PRACTICE WAS AN INCREASED INCIDENT OF 
 CANCER OF THE BOWEL. IT WOULD TAKE    
 ANOTHER TWENTY YEARS TO SEE THE FULL  
 EFFECTS OF THE NUCLEAR STATIONS.      </content>
