		<title>11LAW AND ORDER IN BLAYDON.</title>
		<content> We went on a visit to the police      
 station. There were lots of posters of
 people who were wanted for murder. The
 police station was opened in 1962. In 
 May 1985 approximately 150-180 people 
 arrested. There are about 110 people  
 who work at the police station. The   
 police do not often have trouble in   
 Blaydon and Winlaton.  The policemen  
 think it is a good idea to wear a     
 uniform. When you are a policeman you 
 have to be 1m 70cm tall and a         
 policewoman has to be 1m 60cm tall. A 
 policeman works an eight hour day but 
 often does overtime.                  
 A Blaydon solicitor with eleven years 
 experience said that divorce cases    
 made up 65% of her work. She          
 specialised in matremonial law. She   
 thought today's laws were more just   
 than those in Norman times.
