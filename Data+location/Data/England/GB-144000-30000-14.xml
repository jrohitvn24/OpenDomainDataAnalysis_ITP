		<title>14NANCEALVERNE HOUSE</title>
		<content>  Nancealverne House, the rear of it   
 dating back to the 18th.cent.,is built
 of granite with a Cornish slate roof. 
 The house stands in its own grounds   
 which are now used mainly for market  
 gardening.The house has extensive     
 views over"The Park"which is used for 
 grazing cattle.Agricultural shows have
 been held there,and once even a       
 circus.                               
  The inside of the house is hung with 
 portraits of the ancestors of the     
 present owner,Mr.J.Scobell Armstrong. 
 Earlier generations of the family were
 either soldiers or in the Navy,like   
 Lt.Armstrong,who served with{Nelson}at
 the Battle of Trafalgar.Much of the   
 family's prosperity came from their   
 tin mines,which they still own.       
  Nancealverne is{not open}to the      
 public,but can be clearly seen from   
 the main Penzance to Heamoor road.  H.</content>
