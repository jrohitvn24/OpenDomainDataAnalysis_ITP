		<title>03DRIFT GEOLOGY IN LAMLASH.</title>
		<content>   The rocky deposits which constitute 
 Lamlash are mainly made up of boulder 
 clay.This was deposited during the ice
 age which occured in the Pliestocone  
 period.These boulder clays are mainly 
 found on the higher areas of ground.On
 the very high areas (up to 300m),there
 are moraines.These probably came from 
 the granite area in the North of the  
 island,and were carried down in a     
 Southerly direction by the glaciers.  
    In the Cnoc Dubh area there is a   
 triangular deposit of red sandstone.  
 This is enclosed by a series of pitch 
 stone dykes.The dykes evolved before  
 the sandstones and this is why the    
 sandstone deposits were prevented from
 moving any further.The farming and the
 housing areas of Lamlash are built on 
 intermediate beaches.This is why      
 farming in Lamlash has always been    
 popular due to the partly sandy soils.</content>
