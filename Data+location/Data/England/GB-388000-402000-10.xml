		<content>   We visited British Aerospace and    
 were shown round by a retired         
 superintendent called Stanley and     
 Bernard, a research worker. We had a  
 film show and each received books     
 showing the planes Avro's had made in 
 the past. Stanley began in l926 making
 biplanes with wooden spars and cloth- 
 covered wings. The walls of the       
 canteen had painting of bygone planes.
   We saw how metal was stretched,     
 bent, machined, pressed and spun.     
 Harry, the metal spinner had made each
 one of us a bowl. We saw metal being  
 tested to breaking point and dipped in
 salt baths so it can be shaped without
 buckling. In the training school a    
 computer controlled lathe made us     
 a chess piece. In one bay, we looked  
 in the body of a plane, called its    
 fuselage and had our picture taken for
 the Oldham Chronicle.                 </content>
