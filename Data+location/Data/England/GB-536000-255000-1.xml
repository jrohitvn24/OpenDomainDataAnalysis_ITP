		<title>01GREENWICH MERIDIAN LINE</title>
		<content> The line of longitude 0 or the        
 Meridian Line runs quite close to the 
 village of Comberton and this is how  
 our school got its name.              
 The school was built in 1969 and last 
 year we celebrated 100 years of the   
 Meridian Line by fixing a stone sun   
 dial on the line where it crosses the 
 Comberton Road between the villages of
 Toft and Comberton. There was also a  
 tree planted at this point when the   
 school opened.                        
 The Post Office flew along the        
 Meridian Line in a helicopter and     
 landed on the school playing field and
 some children were interviewed on     
 television. We visited Greenwich      
 Observatory and the Maritime museum   
 and also had a first-day cover postage
 stamp issued from the school. These   
 should be valuable in the future.
