		<content>      The area has been surveyed and   
 written about by members of the Combe 
 Martin Historical Society with the    
 help of friends and neighbours.       
 Photographs have been supplied by the 
 Warden of the Exmoor National Park.   
     It is regretted that the          
 information supplied is not more      
 comprehensive but a 31 January 1986   
 deadline left the Society only ten    
 days to collect information on this   
 block and the one to the south of it. 
      The information was stored on    
 disk by a member of the Society.      
      The photographs are the only ones
 available to us and the deadline left 
 no time to get others taken and       
 processed.
