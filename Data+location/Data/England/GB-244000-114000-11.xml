		<title>11LOCAL EVENTS</title>
		<content> There are not many events that happen 
 in Langtree but there has been a      
 fascinating event lately. Many        
 children and villagers have been      
 involved in a pageant to celebrate the
 fact that the first Rector at Langtree
 Church(not dedicated) was appointed   
 700 years ago. The pageant was held in
 the Church and depicted life over the 
 last 700 years in Langtree. The school
 children put on a display of research 
 work into village history as part of  
 the pageant and a Civil War cannon    
 brought by the Sealed Knot Society was
 fired in the school playing field.    
                                       
 There are a number of fetes held in   
 the village during the year where     
 people gather to buy and sell.
