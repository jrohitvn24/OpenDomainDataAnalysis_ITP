		<content> The University Field Station, as a    
 farm, is worked for profit.As an area 
 of research, the 620 acres of land are
 an outdoor laboratory. Animal and     
 plant behaviour is stydied. 50% of the
 land is under grass, 50% sown with    
 winter and spring barley and winter   
 wheat. The herd of 105 Freisian cows  
 is kept for milk; 276 bulls, heifers  
 and steers are for beef or breeding. A
 flock of 800 sheep, cross Swaledale   
 and Leicester ewes and lambs, with    
 Suffolk are bred for meat. Over 300   
 Landrace/Large White pigs are bred for
 bacon.The soil, which varies from     
 light gravels to heavy clay, is kept  
 workable by much machinery.Eight      
 people work here besides the farm     
 manager, who, looking around him,     
 thinks this will be a good year.
