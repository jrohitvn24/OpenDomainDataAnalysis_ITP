		<title>06SPECIAL PUB NAMES</title>
		<content>       Stapleford has some very        
 interesting pub names. 'The Old       
 Cross', is named after the old stone  
 cross in St. Helen's churchyard, which
 used to be in middle of the High      
 Street.                               
    The 'Warren Arms', is named after  
 the Warren family. Sir John Borlase   
 Warren and Lady Caroline Warren who   
 devoted their lives to helping the    
 community.                            
    'The Happy Man', was named after   
 Sir John Borlase Warren, who asked    
 Lady Caroline to marry him. She agreed
 and made him a 'Happy Man'. So that is
 how it received it's name.            
    'The Sherwin Arms',was rebuilt in  
 1953 to make way for a highway:the A52
 and B5010. Recently, 'The White Lion',
 was modernised. Both the Inns have had
 several owners.
