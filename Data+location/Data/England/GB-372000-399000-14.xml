		<title>14Day in My Life - Parent 2</title>
		<content> After sending the kids back to school,
 mopping up puddles, making beds and   
 putting clothes away I went to school 
 to meet with the teachers as it was   
 the day for parents. I had a great    
 chat with Mrs McQuade who will be     
 visiting my homeland, America, this   
 summer. I also met and chatted with 4 
 parents for the first time which was  
 great for me as we are fairly new to  
 the area.                             
 I got home in time to prepare tea     
 (main meal) of brisket, potatoes and  
 peas, celery and pickled onion. My    
 husband was off to a prayer meeting,  
 the children played outside so I      
 watched a chat show and read the      
 paper. The big news of the day was the
 American President's health. They are 
 concerned that he may not be able to  
 finish the remainder of his 3 years in
 office.                               </content>
