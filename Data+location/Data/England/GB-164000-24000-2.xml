 The Pool is one and a quarter miles   
 long, four and a half miles around,   
 800 to 900 feet wide.The river Cober  
 supplies over four_fifths of its      
 water.There are many trout in the pool
 which is very deep and weedy, making  
 it dangerous for bathing.The pool has 
 become smaller over the years because 
 of silt carried down by the river     
 Cober from old mine workings inland.  
 The water level can rise causing      
 floods in the St Johns area of        
 Helston. The sign that flooding was   
 getting serious  was when the Town    
 mill wheel stopped turning.In 1850 a  
 natural adit was found that could     
 drain water into the sea but sometimes
 it gets blocked by silt. The only     
 thing to do to relieve the flooding is
 to breach Loe Bar to let the pool     
 water drain to a safe level.          </content>
