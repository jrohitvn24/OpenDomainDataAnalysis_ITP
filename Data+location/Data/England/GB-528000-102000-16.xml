		<title>16BRUNSWICK TOWN</title>
		<content> Brunswick Town was started in 1825 and
 was intended to be a self-supporting  
 unit and includes St Andrew's Church, 
 designed by Sir Charles Barry and the 
 Market Building, both of which still  
 stand.  Brunswick Terrace and Square  
 are matched only by the Regency       
 Terraces of Bath.  Due to social and  
 economic change during the 20th       
 century - smaller families, the       
 decline in the employment of servants 
 - meant such large houses, some of 5  
 storeys, were no longer viable. Most  
 of the houses were converted for      
 multiple occupation (many of the      
 residents being retired)>  Under the  
 Town &amp; Country Planning Act of 1947   
 Brunswick Town has been declared a    
 Conservation area.  A special         
 Development Plan was updated in 1985.
