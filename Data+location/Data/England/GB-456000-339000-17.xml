		<content>            FACTORIES                  
 There is a big range of factories on  
 Colwick Road in Sneinton,from         
 engineering works to potato           
 wholesalers.They are only small       
 factories and most of them only have  
 six to twelve people working there.   
 Some people work as engineers and some
 store Corona pop and orange squash.   
 Some just work as office workers and  
 some work on old cars and lorries that
 need new engines or new doors.One     
 factory provides things for schools   
 and colleges and one sells potatoes   
 but that opens at 5.30 in the morning 
 so we didn't go there.The people who  
 work in the factories are worried     
 about their jobs and about the future 
 in case they lose their jobs.
