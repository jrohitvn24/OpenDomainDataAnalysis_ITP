		<title>13Population in The Maylands</title>
		<content> The 1981 census showed a total of 2464
 but this has been estimated to have   
 increased to{2746 by 1985.}250 houses 
 are being built in Mayland alone with 
 an estimated increase in population of
 1000 in ten years.{Social classes}for 
 the area are:-                        
      Class 1  210                     
      Class 2  570                     
      Class 3 270 non manual           
      Class 3 890 manual               
      Class 4  160                     
      Class 5    80                    
 Out of 792 households{747 are owner   
{occupied.}The emphasis is on space    
 with only one household having more   
 than 1.5 persons per room and most    
 with one or less. In 1981 there were  
{247 OAP'S.}It is doubtful if this has 
 increased much. It is essentially a   
 young community. There were 733       
 children aged 15 or under.            </content>
