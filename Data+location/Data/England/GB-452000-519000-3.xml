		<title>03MY NEIGHBOURHOOD</title>
		<content> My neighbouhood is mainly made up of  
{Council houses.}There are a few       
{Private houses}which differ from the  
 others because the people who bought  
 them changed the window frames and    
 doors when they purchased them from   
 the council.The people complained to  
 the council that the houses were cold 
 so they were then modernised,central  
 heating was installed and they were   
 pebbledashed on the outside.Our area  
 is a{smokeless zone,}that means we can
 only burn a certain type of fuel on   
 the fire.                             
 Near my home a new{Supermarket}called 
 Kwik-save has recently opened.A       
 supermarket is a shop in which you can
 buy almost anything.Local supermarkets
 have an age limit of 16 because of the
 problem of shop-lifting.
