		<title>10LYDFORD'S GROWTH</title>
		<content>   In Anglo Saxon times Lydford was a  
 thriving settlement with strong       
 defences and a Mint, but as the towns 
 neighbouring it grew so Lydford's     
 prosperity declined in spite of being 
 the seat of the Stannary Parliament.  
 The Castle fell into ruins and the    
 village became very poor.It was not   
 until 1870 that fortunes changed.Then 
 the G.W.R. and the S.R. both built    
 railway lines through the village from
 Exeter and N.Devon to Plymouth.This   
 made a change for the better because  
 visitors began coming to enjoy the    
 Moors.Hotels were built to accomodate 
 them. Today the railways have gone but
 tourists come in large numbers and are
 catered for with Bed and Breakfast,   
 Hotels, camp sites and pony trekking. 
 In addition the population has been   
 increased by people settling in       
 Lydford for their retirement years.   </content>
