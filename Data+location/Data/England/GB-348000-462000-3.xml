		<content>Our area contains some pleasant        
countryside ideal for country walks and
picnics.A fair proportion of the       
children take advantage of this.A lot  
of fishing goes on but,surprisingly,no 
horse riding.The grassy areas of the   
estate are used by the children for    
games of soccer and cricket,but        
informal games like tag (tiggy),tin    
can lurkey,skipping,ball juggling and  
hop skotch are played in the street.   
There are virtually no clubs or        
organised activities within our area   
other than those provided by the       
schools or churches.They include chess 
,music,sport and youth clubs.To join   
clubs other than these the children    
have to travel further afield into     
Lancaster and Morecambe.Approximately  
20 different clubs were available      
including self defence,fishing,dancing,
