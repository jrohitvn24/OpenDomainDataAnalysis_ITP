		<title>08SHOPPING IN SALISBURY</title>
		<content> WE CATCH THE BUS INTO AMESBURY AND    
 THEN WE GET ANOTHER ONE INTO          
 SALISBURY.WE TRAVEL THIS WAY BECAUSE  
 IT IS CHEAPER - STRAIGHT TO SALISBURY 
 IT WOULD COST Â£1.27. IN SALISBURY THE 
 FIRST PLACE WE GO TO IS A CAFE,SO WE  
 DON'T GET HUNGRY DURING OUR SHOPPING. 
 WE USUALLY GO TO THE MARKET AND BUY   
 FRESH VEGETABLES. WE GO AND LOOK AT   
 ALL THE SHOE SHOPS AND CLOTHES SHOPS  
 TO SEE IF WE CAN SPEND OUR POCKET     
 MONEY, Â£8; AFTER WE'VE BEEN TO BEJAM'S
 AND GOT FROZEN FOOD, THEN WE GO TO    
 TESCO'S WHERE WE GET MOST OF OUR FOOD.
 ALL THIS FOOD HAS TO LAST US A MONTH. 
 WHEN WE HAVE FINISHED WE GO TO THE    
 WIMPEY AND HAVE A HAMBURGHER, CHIPS   
 AND COKE. AFTER THIS WE GO DOWN TO THE
 BUS DEPOT AND HIRE A TAXI TAKE US     
 HOME.                                 
                                       
                                       </content>
