		<title>09Friday Bridge Church</title>
		<content> the church was built in 1864 and the  
 naem of it is St Mark's church. There 
 is something unusual about the spire. 
 It is leaning because the peat dried  
 out. Father Gunn said in 50 years time
 they might have to remove the spire.  
 The church has 51 gravestones. The    
 Chapeldown Back Road was built in 1843
 and the last service was about 1975.  
 Now the chapel is used for a fruit and
 vegetable store. The Chapel was built 
 in 1862. It is now empty because the  
 engineering firm has moved to larger  
 premises.
