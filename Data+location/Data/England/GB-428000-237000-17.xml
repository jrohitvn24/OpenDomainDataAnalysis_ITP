		<title>17FAMILY LIFE IN BRAILES</title>
		<content>   I live in Jeffs Close with my       
 mum,dad and little brother.My dad is a
 Toolroom Grinder and my mum is a      
 School Meals Supervisor.My brother and
 I go to Brailes C.E. Primary School.  
 Nan and Gramp live just round the     
 corner.Our other grandparents live    
 in Chipping Campden.                  
   We often go for walks and bike      
 rides,or go out in the car.We have two
 pets,one is a rabbit,the other is a   
 budgerigar.Tea in our house is about  
 5.30p.m.Afterwards I usually go out to
 play with my friends.                 
   Our family get on fairly well       
 together,but sometimes my brother and 
 I argue.At the weekend we have lots   
 of fun indoors and outdoors,playing   
 mostly board games inside,and         
 tennis,badminton,cricket and lots more
 enjoyable things outside.
