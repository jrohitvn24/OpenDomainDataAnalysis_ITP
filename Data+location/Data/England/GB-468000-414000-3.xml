		<title>03SCHOOLS IN MOOREND</title>
		<content> To get to school you had to walk two  
 miles. Now we have two first schools  
 and a middle school which are'nt very 
 far away for the children to walk to. 
   School times were 9-12 and 1.30-4.  
 If you were late you were caned. There
 was West Road Infants and the other   
 first school and the Senior Girls'    
 School in Moorends.                   
   The Senior Boys' School was in      
 Thorne. Now you automatically go to   
 the Grammar School, but before this   
 you had to pass the 11+ exam to get   
 into the school. If you did not pass  
 you went to the appropriate senior    
 school.                               
   At school the main playground games 
 for girls were skipping and hopscotch.
 The boys played whip and top.         
   After school girls had to help mum  
 at home. Most people sent their       
 children to bed about half past seven.</content>
