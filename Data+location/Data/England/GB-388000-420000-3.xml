		<title>03Horsesteads Farm - Shawforth</title>
		<content>   Daytime jobs on the farm include    
 feeding the young stock such as the   
 calves, and repairs to fencing and dry
 stone walling. Milk is sold to the    
 Milk Marketing Board and the fleeces  
 are sold after sheep clipping.        
                                       
   Some of the sheep are killed and    
 sold to butchers. The hay is kept to  
 feed the animals in winter. Mr.       
 Earnshaw owns a tractor, a muck       
 spreader, a mowing machine, a machine 
 to shake the hay and a milking        
 machine.                              
                                       
   Cows are fertilized using an        
 artificial insemination service. They 
 get about 18 calves a year. About 300 
 lambs are born on the farm every year.
 The male lambs are sold but most of   
 the ewes are kept.
