		<title>10Leisure and Recreation</title>
		<content> We asked a cross section of villagers 
 to complete a questionnaire about how 
 they spend their leisure time.   Most 
 popular group was the church group and
 mothers and toddlers group. Some      
 groups were not used by villagers but 
 were popular with outsiders.          
 Hartington walks were popular,        
 favourites being the Pilsbury,        
 Manifold and Beresford Dale walks.    
 Television was a favourite with       
 many, Dynasty and gardening programmes
 topping the poll. Gardening itself was
 not a favourite hobby. Everyone agreed
 that more leisure time would be a good
 idea.
