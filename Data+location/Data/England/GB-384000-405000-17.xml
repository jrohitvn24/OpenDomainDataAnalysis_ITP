		<content>{ St.LEONARD'S PARISH CHURCH:}Most of  
 the building was erected in the 15th  
 and 16th Centuries but a church has   
 stood on the site for 800 years. There
 is a stained glass window             
 commemorating the Battle of Flodden.  
 There is also an unusual wooden       
 belfry.

 local families.{

{THE OLDE BOAR'S HEAD INN}is a black &amp; 
 white timber building dating from     
 Tudor times. It was a farm before it  
 was turned into a public house.
