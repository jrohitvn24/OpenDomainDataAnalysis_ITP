		<content> The most recent census shows that     
 about 40% of the working population in
 this area were employers, managers,   
 professional people or non-hand       
 workers.  9% were occupied in farming 
 and the shops, local sevices and      
 businesses also provide some local    
 employment.  A large number (54%)     
 travel short distances to work in     
 nearby towns, particularly Harlow,    
 Bishops Stortford, Sawbridgeworth and 
 Stansted while the remainder travel   
 further distances, mainly to London.  
 While the number of local jobs        
 available is higher than in many      
 villages, most of the local people    
 have to travel out of the village to  
 work.  In this area we are fortunate  
 to have one of the lowest unemployment
 levels (about 4\% at present).  We    
 found out that 21% of our population  
 is under 16 and 17% are pensioners.   </content>
