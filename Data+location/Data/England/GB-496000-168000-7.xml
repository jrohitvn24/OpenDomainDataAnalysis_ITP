		<content> The tack can be worth up to Â£10000.   
 The harnesses are worth Â£1500,a team  
 set is Â£4000 and the saddles are worth
 Â£500_Â£600.Some of the events are cross
 country and polo.The length of the    
 track on cross country events are up  
 to 2240m,5400m and 300_600m for show  
 jumping.We asked how many events there
 were in a year but he could'nt answer 
 because there were so many but he said
 there were 18 events in the park.Some 
 of the events last up to 1_3 days.The 
 most expensive kind of horse they have
 is the Australian cow ponies which are
 used for polo and they have 3 of them 
 at Southgates.Some of the horses have 
 been on T.V show walking.They train at
 Southgates because they have a track  
 and a school there.In a carriage they 
 usually have 2_4 people.
