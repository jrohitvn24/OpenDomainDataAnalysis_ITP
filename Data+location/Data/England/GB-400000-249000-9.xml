		<content>     Annard Crafts started as a hobby  
 in the home of the owner, a Bromsgrove
 accountant,who had to give up work due
 to illness.Having some knowledge of   
 carpet making, he started work making 
 hand crafted rugs ,of natural fibres, 
 designed by his wife.They started hand
 knitted garments to use up excess wool
 from the carpets,using outworkers to  
 make up the knitwear.The designs are  
 all exclusive to Annard crafts.       
     In 1980 they moved to Handgate    
 Farm in Church Lench where they have  
 workrooms,showrooms and a shop as well
 as a home.They produce rugs and huge  
 carpet tapestries,knitware,wool mohair
 sweaters,spinning wheels,fleeces and  
 mohair Knit-Kits.                     
     Visitors are welcome to watch the 
 work and get advice on all aspects of 
 knitting and rug making.
