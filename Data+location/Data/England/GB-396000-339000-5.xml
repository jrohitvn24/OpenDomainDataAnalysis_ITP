There have been many changes in the    
village of Draycott since I was born in
1944. The volume of traffic has        
increased considerably since the days  
when cattle were driven along the A50  
to Blythe Bridge market. More cars have
enabled people to take employment      
further afield, which, for the majority
people was limited to farming, Creda   
Cooker factory and Blythe Colours. Bus 
services through Draycott were better  
and more frequent. Demolition of       
cottages, some thatched, erection of   
more houses, electricity pylons,       
widening of roads and the building of  
the by-pass have changed the           
landscape. Spare plots of land now     
built on were used for allotments,     
circuses, fairs, sports etc. Draycott  
sports centre which was the old        
tennis club has now become popular.    </content>
