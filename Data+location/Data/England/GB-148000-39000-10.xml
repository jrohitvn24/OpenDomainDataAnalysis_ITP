 readings, recitals, lectures, dances, 
 and exhibitions.{Music}ranges from    
 madrigals to reggae, and{dance        
 companies from ballet to breakdance.

 (harking back to the earlier days of  
 the artists colony). Childrens events 
 involve street{theatre},clowns and    
 painting competitions.

 holiday season, and attracting both   
 resident and tourist alike.
