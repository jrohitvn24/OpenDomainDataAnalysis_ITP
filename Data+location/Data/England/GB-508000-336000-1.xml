 astride the A52 road but was by passed
 about 10 years ago.  The ancient pub  
 is struggling to attract custom.  The 
 residents complain that the village   
 streets are too narrow for modern farm
 machinery.  There are also complaints 
 about the villages only industry, a   
 tyre remould factory.  The village is 
 trying to raise money to buy land for 
 a playing field.  The hamlet of Spanby
 to the North comprises of a few       
 cottages and agricultural holdings.   
 The farm at the corner of Mareham Lane
 concentrates on 'Pick your own' fruit 
 and vegetables.  The Clay soil of the 
 area is divided into medium sized     
 fields by thorn hedges.  The crops are
 cerials, sugar beet potatoes &amp; oilseed
 rape with two blocks of conifirous    
 woodland on white house farm.  For    
 those people who rely on public       </content>
