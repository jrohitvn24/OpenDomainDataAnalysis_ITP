		<content>  Many people in and around the town   
 work for the Ministry of Defence in   
 Bath where Naval Headquarters are     
 situated. A huge proportion of our    
 national income is spent on,          
 "Defence," and a large beaurocratic   
 administrative force is required to   
 run our defence establishments. Many  
 of these minor officials live in      
 Bradford-on-Avon, as do many retired  
 military officers. The underground web
 of worked out quarries in the area    
 also provide excellent safety bunkers 
 which may offer short term protection 
 for personel, equipment and records in
 the event of nuclear war. Many people 
 live in fear of nuclear attack.       
 Bradford-on-Avon is a centre of Quaker
 following and peace movements.
