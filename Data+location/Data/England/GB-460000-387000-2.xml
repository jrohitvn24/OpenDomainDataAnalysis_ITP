		<title>02BLYTH RECOLLECTIONS. (1)</title>
		<content>{Interview with Miss and Mrs Oakes.}   
 Miss and Mrs Oakes first recollection 
 of Blyth is,fetching the milk.The     
 first milkman came round with a pint  
 measure. The first milkbottle came in 
 about 1932. Their second recollection 
 is when Lord Barnby was a squire at   
 the hall: when he died about 1929 his 
 coffin went on a farm wagon to the new
 cemetery and every boy from the school
 carried a wreath.                     
{Changes in Blyth.}                    
 The traffic has changed, wider roads, 
 bigger fields, fewer hedges, fewer    
 wild flowers and the roads are        
 smoother. They used to have tall      
 signposts so that the horsemen could  
 see but now they are low.Electricity  
 came in 1930. Water used to come      
 from wells. Some people got water from
 the water tower at Blyth hall.
