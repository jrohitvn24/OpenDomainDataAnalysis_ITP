		<content> 8.30am. I arrive at the Drinks Problem
 Unit, Fulbourn Hospital, and unlock   
 doors, check the patients are OK, and 
 give medication if necessary.         
 9.00 Staff meeting and cup of tea.    
 9.30-10.15 Community Meeting. Everyone
 at the Unit, staff as well as         
 patients, sits round in a circle to   
 share common or individual problems.  
  After this, each morning is          
 different, with perhaps new patients  
 to admit, or smaller group work.      
  After lunch I may see some patients  
 on their own, or counsel spouses of   
 patients. Visiting hours are flexible-
 people can come at any time group     
 sessions are not on.                  
 5.30 pm. I lock up and go home.       
  It is a long day; sometimes the      
 patients can be angry or violent      
 (there is a punch-ball for them to    
 vent their anger on), but I enjoy it. </content>
