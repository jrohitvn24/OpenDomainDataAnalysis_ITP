 St. Keverne Parish has a policeman who
 lives in the village.  He is available
 24 hours a day.  There is constant    
 contact between the villagers and the 
 'bobby'.  He is involved in the       
 village committees and the Parish     
 Council activities.  Most crimes in   
 this area are of the 'petty' variety. 
 Sometimes his work is outside of the  
 parish.  He assists as a reserve with 
 Coast Guards, Life boat and the Fire  
 Brigade.  St. Keverne is lucky enough 
 to have a station manned by local     
 volunteers.  The Firemen are contacted
 by 'alerters'.  The Health Centre with
 two doctors can deal with minor       
 ailments and burns but the nearest    
 hospital is in Truro.  Our local      
 'bobby' has been with us for five     
 years and is a well established member
 of the community.                     </content>
