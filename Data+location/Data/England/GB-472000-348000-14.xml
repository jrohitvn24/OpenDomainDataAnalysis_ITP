		<title>14EMPLOYMENT ON THE LAND</title>
		<content> Most of the land in the block is used 
 for arable farming, but this is now   
 mechanised and is no longer the labour
 intensive industry that it used to be.
 The majority of farms are privately   
 owned and worked by the owner and his 
 family.  There are still 5 working    
 farms in{Elston}and 4 in{East Stoke.} 
 Two of the farms in{East Stoke}are    
 unusual in that they still employ     
 several farmhands - 7 on one farm, 5  
 on another.  One of the farms in{East 
{Stoke}which includes much of the land 
 of{Stoke Hall}is owned by the national
 glass company,{Pilkingtons,}and farmed
 by a manager.
