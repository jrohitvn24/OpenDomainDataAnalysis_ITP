		<title>03FOOTBALL CLUB IN MAULDEN</title>
		<content> In{Maulden}we have just one football  
 club,with teams for the under 11, 12, 
 14, 16 and men.The men play on Sunday 
 mornings and the under 12's which I am
 in, practices on{Saturday mornings}and
 play matches on{Sundays.}We have two  
 divisons and we are nearly at the     
 bottom of the second divison(1985).   
 We have to play each team at home and 
 away. The same happens for each age   
 group.The age groups each get a news  
 letter nearly every month saying what 
 will be happening soon.The club       
 organise trips to see the matches     
 played at Wembley.At the end of the   
 season each person is given a medal   
 for playing and asked if he would like
 to play next season.We play football  
 at the{Maulden Recreation Ground.}The 
 under 12's also practice on the       
{Alameda School field.
