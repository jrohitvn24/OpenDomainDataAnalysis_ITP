		<content> St. Mary's church, Cratfield is the   
 most impressive building. Built in    
 flint in the Decorated and            
 Perpendicular styles, it has a fine   
 chancel roof. South of it is the Town 
 House, once the Guildhall of St.      
 Edmund, then Almshouses and now a     
 weekend house.Houses range from 16th  
 century to the present day. Several   
 timber framed houses were brick faced 
 during the 19th century. Old cottages 
 are often changed into something rich 
 and strange by their new owners. Farm 
 buildings are generally large, modern 
 and utilitarian, built chiefly of     
 corrugated metal and breeze blocks. of
 three old wooden barns, one is now a  
 sculptor's studio, one a minature     
 theatre and the largest has been used 
 for harvest suppers, a barn dance and 
 once a production of Romeo and Juliet.
