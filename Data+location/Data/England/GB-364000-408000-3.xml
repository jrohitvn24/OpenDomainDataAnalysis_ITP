		<title>03Leisure Patterns in Horwich</title>
		<content>    The holiday pattern in the Horwich 
 area is quite varied with people      
 taking their holidays both at home in 
 the British Isles and abroad. A very  
 small number of people do not take any
 holday and will remain at home. The   
 majority of people take their holidays
 during the Bolton or Horwich local    
 holiday times known as{WAKES WEEKS.}  
                                       
   About half of the people in the     
 community take part in a sport. Many  
 attend the local{Leisure Centre.}This 
 caters for a varity of sports which   
 include swimming, badminton, squash,  
 tabletennis and soccer to name a few. 
 Membership to the Leisure Centre can  
 be obtained.                          
 Although most people make use of the  
 centre or use the local parks there   
 are few who are members of clubs or   
 societies.                            </content>
