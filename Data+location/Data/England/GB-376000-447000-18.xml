		<title>18Buildings-Bolton by Bowland</title>
		<content> All the buildings are grey stone and  
 painted black and white.There have    
 been no new buildings, apart from the 
 village hall twenty years ago, since  
 the 1930's although a lot of houses   
 have been converted and adapted.One   
 row of houses in Bolton by Bowland is 
 more than 290 years old.              
 The{Court House,}which was once the   
 court for the whole of Bowland        
 area,has a very large fireplace with a
 coat of arms above it.It is now a     
 private house.                        
{Stocks House,}which is next to the    
 village stocks,was built in 1880 and  
 has been used for lots of things in   
 the past,a reading room, a bakery,a   
 coffee house and a police station.    
 An old barn in the village was once a 
 coach house but it is being converted 
 into a house.
