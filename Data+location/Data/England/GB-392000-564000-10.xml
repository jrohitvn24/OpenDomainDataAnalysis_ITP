 The market is very busy and there is  
 lots of shouting.There are lots  of   
 things to sell like fruit,sweets,toys 
 etc.If you  get there about 10 minutes
 before it closes every thing is       
 cheap.The covered in bit is called the
 shambles which was built in 1766.The  
 market starts at 9.00 am and closes   
 inbeween half past 4 or 5.I think the 
 market would be nice if it was bigger 
 but there is nowhere to put it.The car
 park is closed  on Tuesday because of 
 the market being there.At Easter a    
 girl and a man dressed up as bears    
 come and have a lucky dip. The market 
 has birthday cards as well.The market 
 is near the abbey.In the summer,beside
 the market,there is a puppet show     
 called Punch and Judy.As well as that 
 there is a magic show and people take 
 part in it.                           </content>
