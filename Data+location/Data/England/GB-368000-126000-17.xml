		<content>{(Milking cont)}Twelve cows are milked 
 at a time and the whole herd takes    
 about two hours. The milk is stored in
 bulk tanks until it is taken by tanker
 to Longman's at Sparkford for{cheese- 
 making. His production quota is half a
 million litres per year.              
  This part of Somerset has a{temperate
 climate and the heavy soil is good for
 growing{grass.}That is why Mr. Cocks  
 likes farming here. He usually expects
 to put the cows out in mid-April. He  
 begins to make{silage}and{hay}from    
 about mid-May and continues throughout
 the Summer months. He reseeds where he
 needs to in August and September. In  
 October the grass stops growing and   
 the cows are fed on silage and        
 concentrates.The cows eat 1\ tonnes of
 concentrates per year and the bulls   
 consume 1\ tonnes of barley per year.
