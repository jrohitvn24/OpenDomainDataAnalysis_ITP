		<content>  The{Belsay Estate}is the main        
 landowner in our area. It was known to
 have belonged to the{Middleton}family 
 as early as 1270. There are three main
 buildings on the Estate.              
  1.{The Castle.}This was constructed  
 in the late 14th Century primarily as 
 a defence against Border raiders.     
 There are still traces of painted wall
 decorations dating back to the 15th   
 Century to be seen in the{Great Hall. 
 Although the castle now stands apart  
 from the other buildings, during      
 Medieaval times a village settlement  
 grew up close by on what was then the 
 main Jedburgh to Newcastle road.      
 Belsay Village as we know it today did
 not come into existence until the 19th
 Century.                              
  2.{The Manor House.}Now derelict, the
 house dates back to the early 1600's.
