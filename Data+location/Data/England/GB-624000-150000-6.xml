		<title>06ST. ALBAN'S COURT.</title>
		<content>  The existing house was built in 1875.
 The Hammond family lived at St.       
 Alban's for four hundred years. The   
 house provided a lot of jobs in the   
 area.  The girls would clean,cook,    
 wash up or tend the fires.The boys did
 gardedning, shoe cleaning and looked  
 after the horses.                     
  When the foundations for the present 
 building were dug some human bones,   
 probably Roman, were discovered.      
  In 1938 St. Albans was sold and the  
 building was turned into a Teacher's  
 Training  College. It had thirteen    
 students to begin with.Next year,1986,
 the college will be sold. Many of the 
 children who live in the area are very
 sad because they will no longer be    
 able to use the swimming pool there.
