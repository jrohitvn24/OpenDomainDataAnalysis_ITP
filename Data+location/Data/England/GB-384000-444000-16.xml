		<content>The warden central consol system is    
for O.A.P. that cannot move around     
very well.If for instance a pensioner  
wanted her pension and could not go    
and get it because she had an illness. 
She would press a black button and it  
would bleep at central control. The    
warden would then stop the bleeping and
talk through a mircophone to them, the 
lady would tell him what was wrong,and 
her name and address.This information  
would be fed into a computer which     
would give fuller information.For      
instance  it will tell you where       
her nearest relations are. The wardens 
will then ring them up and they        
will tell them to get their mothers    
pension for her.It can be used in      
sheltered homes or individual houses.It
is ideal in emergency situations.
