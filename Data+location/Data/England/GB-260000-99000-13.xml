		<title>13Tourism in Sampford Courtney</title>
		<content> Sampford Courtney has a Camp Site on  
 the outskirts and many visitors come  
 into the village.                     
 However,there is no special provision 
 for Tourists.The Village Post Office, 
 as the only shop,benefits from        
 tourism.There are no outward signs of 
 Bed and Breakfast Boards,although some
 of the farms take in visitors.        
   Talking to the residents we got the 
 impression that they quite liked      
 people walking round admiring the     
 place,but not the litter they dropped,
 nor the noise they made.In fact, they 
 would rather the average tourist did  
 not come,only those who were able to  
 appreciate the beauty of the village  
 and behave with proper decorum.       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
