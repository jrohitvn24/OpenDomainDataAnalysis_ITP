 This is one of the traditional East   
 Anglian building crafts. Timber framed
 buildings were covered in plaster     
 between the beams of the frame.       
 Designs were then made in the plaster.
 They were done by pressing a wooden   
 mould into the wet plaster. The most  
 common designs were simple geometric  
 patterns. Designs in flowers were also
 done and more rarely elaborate figures
 as on the Sun Inn.                    
 Alec Clifton Taylor made a television 
 programme for BBC about Saffron Walden
 in which he showed it being done.
