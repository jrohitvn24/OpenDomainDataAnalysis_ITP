		<content>The area surveyed is mainly pasture    
land. It is undulating countryside,    
crisscrossed with narrow lanes enclosed
by high banks and hedges. Though       
beautiful and situated almost in the   
centre of Devon, midway between the two
great moors, Dartmoor and Exmoor, it is
rarely mentioned in guides to the      
trappings of the tourist trade.        
Until recently, the population were    
mostly born and bred within a ten mile 
radius and, even today, the majority   
are Devonians although the area's      
proximity to Exeter has led to the     
population becoming more mixed, both in
occupation and origin.
