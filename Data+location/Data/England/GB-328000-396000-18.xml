     Down our road there are detached, 
 semi-detached and terraced houses.On  
 one side the houses don't have        
 anything in front.On this side the    
 houses are well looked after.The      
 houses opposite have small front      
 gardens.On these houses the paint is  
 dirty and peeling off.Mostly old      
 people live there.One house at the    
 bottom of the road has just been      
 restored.Most of them have a small    
 back garden or yard.Running along the 
 back is a dirty alley.Most of the     
 houses are quite old.The terraced ones
 are a bit older than the ones on our  
 side.Some of the houses in our road   
 have been altered with new windows and
 doors put in or kitchen extensions    
 built.In the last year three or four  
 old ladies have died and their houses 
 have been sold.             (Emma)    </content>
