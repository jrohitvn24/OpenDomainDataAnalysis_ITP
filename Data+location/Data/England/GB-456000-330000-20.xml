		<title>20BRADMORE VILLAGE</title>
		<content> This small village of about 500       
 residences is three miles from {      
{Ruddington.}It has no shops and is    
 very quiet.Most people who live there 
 have bought a house to live in the    
 village although they work in {       
{Nottingham }or {Loughborough.}The lack
 of facilities does not bother the     
 people I interviewed as they have cars
 and mainly shop in{Ruddington }or at  
 the supermarket {ASDA}in{West         
{Bridgford}and in{Nottingham }for      
 clothes.                              
 People chose to live in {Bradmore }   
 because they wanted a quiet life and  
 the lack of a pub meant there would be
 no traffic problems. They are willing 
 to transport their children to school,
 the library and to clubs.             
 This year a plaque has been put on a  
 wall to commemorate the {Morris       
{Dancers} who still come once a year.  </content>
