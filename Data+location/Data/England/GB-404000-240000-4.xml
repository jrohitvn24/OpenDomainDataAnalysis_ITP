		<title>04Village of Wickhamford - two</title>
		<content>  There are several shops including the
 Post Office. The Old Age Pensioners do
 their major shopping in Wickhamford,  
 but others travel to Evesham or       
 Cheltenham. The A44 road is very busy,
 with heavy traffic. There are fruit   
 stalls along Pitchers Hill, especially
 in summer.                            
  The local pub is called the Sandys   
 Arms. The village has a playing field 
 which is used for football and there  
 is a sports club. The field has a     
 slide and climbing frame. The parish  
 council has 7 members. Some of them   
 attend meetings of The Playing Fields 
 Association and the Parish Councils   
 Association, where they can gain      
 advice, and sometimes grants. They    
 deal with litter, vandalism and look  
 after the cemetary in Golden Lane.    
 Recently they allocated a grant       
 towards the Scout Hut in Badsey.      </content>
