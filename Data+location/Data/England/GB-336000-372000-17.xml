		<content> In a survey of residents shopping     
 habits it was found that Saturday,    
 Friday &amp; Thursday were the main days  
 used for shopping and in that order of
 popularity.People are paid on Thursday
 &amp; Friday &amp; few people work on Saturday
 Due to the lack of a bus service most 
 shoppers use their cars &amp; to save time
 &amp; petrol rarely go more than 6 miles. 
 Most people shop for food at Little   
 Sutton because it is near &amp; has a few 
 supermarkets although many travel to  
 Chester for meat.Vegetables &amp; bread   
 are bought at Little Sutton &amp; Hope    
 Farm.Chester,with its variety of shops
 &amp; large stores,is easily most popular 
 for household goods,furniture,clothes 
 &amp; shoes.These last two items are among
 the few which people are prepared to  
 travel to Birkenhead &amp; Liverpool,by   
 train,to buy.Chester(35%)Little Sutton
 (25%)Ellesmere Port(25%)are used most.</content>
