 The manager of this firm was          
 interviewed and provided this         
 information. The firm moved here      
 because of the rates free period      
 allowed by the council, the good road 
 linkage and because of the space      
 available for development. About 150  
 people are employed during a day shift
 with others working a night shift to  
 keep the depot working around the     
 clock. All the employees come from    
 this area. There are 34 lorries which 
 carry almost anything which is        
 transportable. Goods are delivered all
 over Britain and Ireland.             </content>
