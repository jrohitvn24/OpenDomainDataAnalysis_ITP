 n the Langer Road, Carr Road area of  
Felixstowe there is significant        
industrial development.  The original  
premises of Sangamo Weston are the     
largest and most obvious.  As the firm 
is concerned with making precision     
instruments, the building is without   
windows and instruments for monitoring 
weather conditions are visible on the  
roof. Further towards the dock, Sangamo
have recently extended their premises  
in attractive, landscaped buildings.   
 There are small, industrial units     
being developed near-by to encourage   
new business into the area, but only   
one unit is at present occupied by a   
glass-cutting company.                 
 On the other side of the road is a    
large new caravan site for holiday-    
makers. Each year sees more of this    
flat, open land being used.            </content>
