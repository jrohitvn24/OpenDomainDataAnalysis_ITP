		<title>12THE MEDIA IN S CREAKE</title>
		<content> National and local newspapers, and a  
 selection of periodicals, are         
 delivered by hand to many houses in S 
 Creake, having been brought by van    
 from Kings Lynn.                      
 There is our own Creakes news-sheet,  
 distributed free, four times a year,  
 by volunteers.  it contains articles, 
 poems, drawings of local interest,    
 written and drawn by residents of all 
 ages; with a forthcoming events page, 
 showing times and dates of all village
 activities.                           
 Schoolboys deliver two free           
 advertising papers each week.         
 Most homes have television and radios,
 and videos are becoming popular in the
 younger households.                   
 The mobile Public Library calls once a
 month.
