		<content> of the seats and the different shades 
 of red.Most felt that people would be 
 encouraged to keep the area tidy.There
 is a lot of controversy about parking 
 in the Square,three quarters of       
 councillors are not in favour but     
 local traders and residents have      
 signed a petition asking for an       
 enquiry.Those passing through         
 disagreed with parking alongside the  
 paved area,but local traders fear that
 a loss of short term parking will lead
 to a loss of trade and eventually     
 closure."If the CO-OP goes we all go".
 Everyone agreed that it was           
 unfortunate but necessary to have     
 lorries delivering to the shops.Now   
 that the pavement has been widened in 
 West street (an exit from the Square) 
 should there be a one way system?,    
 feelings were mixed.
