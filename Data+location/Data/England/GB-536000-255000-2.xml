		<title>02MERIDIAN'S COMPUTERS</title>
		<content> Computers are an important part of    
 todays schools.Our school,Meridian in 
 Comberton has eight computers and is  
 part of the government scheme. The    
 scheme pays half the cost of one      
 computer and the school has to pay the
 rest.                                 
 The local authorities however do not  
 pay anything and the school money     
 comes from donations and school fund. 
 We use the computer in many different 
 ways.For example,we are using it to   
 collect the information for the       
 Domesday Project.We use the computers 
 to draw faces that we had described to
 it, we also learnt maths by practising
 fractions on the computer.We use      
 Wordwise wordprossesor and we have a  
 program to help us learn how to write 
 Basic (the language of computers)     
 which in turn helps us in spelling    
 skills,geography,all by a computer.   </content>
