		<title>07Faldingworth Chapel</title>
		<content>    Faldingworth{chapel}is a Methodist 
{chapel.} It is quite small, with a    
 congregation on Sundays of about 7 in 
 the morning and 14 in the evening. It 
 is built of red brick with a slate    
 roof, but no spire. All around the    
 walls are the initials of the men who 
 helped build the{chapel.} The         
 foundations were laid and the{chapel  
 completed in 1897.                    
    It has an organ, a pulpit and a    
 communion rail.                       
    There are several rooms including a
 kitchen, a vestry and a schoolroom.   
    The{chapel}was built to replace an 
 earlier version. It was a very small  
 chapel, with no spire, schoolroom or  
 stained glass windows. It was built in
 approximately 1780 and cost between   
 Â£700 and Â£800. The{chapel}organ was   
 donated by Mr. Doughty in loving      
 memory of his wife, in 1927.          </content>
