		<content>{There are 9 working farms in our area.
{The majority of these are arable farms
 dealing mainly in wheat,barley,       
 mangolds and oilseed rape.One farm    
 keeps pigs and another sells hen and  
 duck eggs.A lot of the farmers were   
 too busy to talk to us but we visited 
 Park Balk Farm and spoke to the       
 farmer,Mr.Huddlestone.His family had  
 worked the farm since 1920.Parts of   
 the fields now in use were once       
 quarries but these were filled in when
 the A1 flyover at Ferrybridge was     
 built.At the moment he is growing     
 barley,wheat and mangolds and was     
 working in the fields clearing wild   
 oats.Only 3 men work at the farm along
 with some casual summer labourers.    
 They own 2 lorries and deliver grain  
 to supplement the farm work.{Mining   
{under the farm is causing subsidence  
{in both the fields and buildings.     </content>
