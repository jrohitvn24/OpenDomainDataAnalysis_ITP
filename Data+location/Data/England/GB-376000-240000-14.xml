		<title>14LITTLE MALVERN PRIORY+COURT</title>
		<content> Founded in 1171 (some say 1150) its   
 local history has nothing to do with  
 Malvern Priory. It was an offshoot    
 from the{Benedictine monastery at     
{Worcester}which used it as a prison of
 religion for 'baddie monks'.Today only
 the{chancel, tower and transept       
 remain. At the Dissolution much of the
 fabric of the domestic buidings went  
 to those who grabbed the current      
 opportunity. Today's{Little Malvern   
{Priory and Court}comprises what       
 remains of the old domestic and       
{monastic buildings}- the refectory and
 prior's hall are part of the current  
 house.{Priest holes and recusant      
{hideouts}in the buildings witness     
 their importance during times of      
 religious unrest. The present         
 residents - the{Berrington family}-   
 have done much serious, sensible      
 reconstruction.                       </content>
