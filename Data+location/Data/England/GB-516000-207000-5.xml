		<content> As we walked along Jersey Lane we     
 noticed all the wildlife. We saw green
 finches, wrens, gold finches, grey    
 squirrels and we even spotted some    
 frogs. It was exciting to go through  
 the bushes; to look and listen to all 
 the different things around us. As we 
 walked further along the path we      
 noticed that there were fewer trees   
 and shrubs on one side of the lane. We
 soon saw why. New houses were being   
 built and all the wildlife seemed to  
 be in great danger. There were lots of
 houses being built and they took up a 
 lot of room. Although there were trees
 on one side of the lane the birds and 
 wildlife were in great danger. The    
 beautiful countryside was being       
 threatened just to build more houses.
