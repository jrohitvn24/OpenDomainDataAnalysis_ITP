 The {River Thames}meanders though the 
 area .The flat fertile land of the    
 river valley stretches away to the    
 west,and east of the river the land   
 rises steeply  towards{Cliveden  and  
{Taplow},and is wooded .The village of 
{Cookham }is the main residental area .
 The old part of the village with its  
{Norman church },interesting old       
 buildings and the bridge is linked    
 with the more recent development of { 
{Cookham Rise }with its modern parade  
 of shops and the station by {Cookham  
{Moor}.                                
      Much of the land is agricultural 
 and some is owned by the{National     
{Trust. Cliveden House} and its        
 grounds is a local beauty spot, and   
 the village has its own art gallery   
 exhibiting the work of {Sir Stanley   
{Spencer.}                             </content>
