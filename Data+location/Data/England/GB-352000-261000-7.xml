 Primary School has 70 children on     
 roll,3 classes and 3 teachers as well 
 as a privately run nursery group which
 meets each morning.Children are       
 admitted at the beginning of the term 
 in which they are 5 and leave at 11+  
 for comprehensive school. It serves 5 
 parishes.                             
                                       
       A typical School Day            
 I usually wake up and read until Mum  
 comes in to tell me to get dressed.   
 After breakfast Mum takes me to a     
 friend's house till the school bus    
 comes.                                
       After arriving at school I leave
 my lunch box and sit in my own special
 place,then the whole class goes       
 to assembly where we sing songs and   
 sometimes listen to a story.
