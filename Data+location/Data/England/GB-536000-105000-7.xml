		<title>07WOODINGDEAN AND ADULTS' WORK</title>
		<content> One hundred and twenty five pupils of 
 Woodingdean Middle School were asked  
 about the working habits of the adults
 in their households.These adults were 
 defined as anyone who had left        
 permanent education.The larger number 
 of workers leave Woodingdean for their
 job,and a small percentage only, do   
 not go to work.                       
          Forty nine adults work in    
          Woodingdean.                 
          One hundred and eight adults 
          work out of Woodingdean.     
          Thirty two adults do not     
          work.                        
 Most people travel to the centre of   
 Brighton to work,whilst others travel 
 to Lewes,Crawley,Gatwick Airport or   
 London.                               
 One child's father works in Stoke on  
 Trent and returns home for three days 
 in each fortnight.                    </content>
