		<title>18LOCAL FARMING 1.</title>
		<content> Farming in the area revolves around a 
 number of well established farms, many
 privately owned and held by families  
 for well over 50 years. There are no  
 large estate farms or vast prairie    
 fields. The farms are very much family
 concerns with whole families including
 young and adult children very much    
 involved in the running of the farm.  
 Most farms are handed from father to  
 son and this pattern is very much     
 supported for the future. Noticeably  
 few people are employed on the farms  
 other than the family even at peak    
 busy times. When the farm is actually 
 owned, the owners appear to often rent
 extra land to farm. Most of the       
 farmers buy and sell at the local     
 market in Leighton Buzzard on a       
 Tuesday, or at the larger Banbury     
 market. Only one farmer indicated that
 he contracted the marketing job out.  </content>
