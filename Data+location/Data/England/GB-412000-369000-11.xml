		<content>   The building was a cowshed converted
 into a Men's Social Club about eighty 
 years ago.They played billiards and   
 read newspapers.They were allowed to  
 smoke but not any alcohol. When the   
 village had a band it practised there.
 When we had cricket and football teams
 they also met there.We again have a   
 Youth Club which meets on Tuesdays. A 
 doctor's surgery is held on Thursdays 
 at noon.The Old People's Club meets   
 once a fortnight.Once a month the W.I.
 meets there as also does the Parish   
 Council.Keep Fit and Aerobic classes  
 for women are held on Mondays and     
 Wednesdays.Whist Drives,Jumble Sales, 
 Hot-pot Suppers and the occasional    
 Disco are held in it.The committee    
 needs Â£30 000 to replace the wooden   
 extension with a permanent structure  
 and for new toilets and kitchen.It has
 to raise Â£10 000 and hope for grants..</content>
