		<content>   Many of the houses in the           
 village,both new and old,take their   
 names from the old field names.The    
 name 'Southfields'goes back to the    
 time before the Norman Conquest when  
 there would be two large fields       
 cultivated in strips.'Chessels'was the
 Saxon name for a place where Roman    
 remains were discovered.The newest    
 estate of council houses has been     
 named Withy Hays,this being the       
 ancient title of the field where they 
 were built.'Broadshord' is a cottage  
 in the field of that name which was   
 shorn off Broad Close.Some of the     
 fields retain their ancient names,    
 Big Wherl being known to the original 
 villagers as Gurt Wherl;this is the   
 largest field in the village.Sandpits,
 Brandirons,Quarry Breach,Matford and  
 Walkmoor possibly reflect their uses  
 in days gone by.                      </content>
