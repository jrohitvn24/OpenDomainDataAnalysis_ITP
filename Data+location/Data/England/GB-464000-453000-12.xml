		<title>12CATTLE BREEDING CENTRE</title>
		<content> The Cattle Breeding Centre opened in  
 1950.Behind the centre there is a big 
 field where they put the bulls.They   
 put all the bulls in the field from   
 May to October.If the weather is good 
 they may keep them out a bit longer.  
         Most of the bulls are         
 different ages.They have bulls from   
 all over the country.                 
         The oldest bull is supposed to
 be 19.Some of the people look after   
 the bulls,some work in an office and  
 some are stockmen.The firm hope they  
 will still be going in four or five   
 years                                 
      The bulls are used for Artificial
 Insemenation of the cows around here.
