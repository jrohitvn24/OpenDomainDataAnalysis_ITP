		<content>    The hamlet is just off the A621.The
 works were built in{1712}and until    
{1933}scythes and other agricultural   
 edge tools were manufactured using the
 unique{Crucible Steel}that made the   
 city famous.It is owned by Sheffield  
 City Museums and was opened to the    
 public in {1970. }                    
                                       
    There is a boring shop where the   
 scythes were prepared to receive      
 handles.It also has a grinding shop   
 where the scythe blades are           
 sharpened.The clay crucible pots were 
 made in the pot shop,before being sent
 to the crucible steel furnace where   
 the steel was melted.Also,a tilt      
 forge with two giant hammers for      
 welding the piece of steel between two
 pieces of iron.
