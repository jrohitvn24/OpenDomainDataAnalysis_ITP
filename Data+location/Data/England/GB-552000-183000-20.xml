		<title>20SUTTONS SCHOOL FETE</title>
		<content> June sees the school fete come round  
 and the weather was fine for it.  When
 2pm came only a few people were there 
 but soon the school was crowded.      
                                       
 In the hall were stalls selling       
 plants, cakes, drinks and raffle      
 tickets.  In other parts of the school
 books, toys, gifts and other things   
 were for sale;.                       
                                       
 Outside was SPIN THE ARROW, GOLF,     
 DARTS and THROW THE WELLIE.  Many     
 people queued up to throw wet sponges 
 at YE OLD FOOL.  This was very popular
 because the Deputy Headteacher was one
 of the two men who stood in the stocks
 to be bombarded wih wet sponges.      
                                       
 The day was enjoyed by all who came - 
 even the fools.                       
                                       </content>
