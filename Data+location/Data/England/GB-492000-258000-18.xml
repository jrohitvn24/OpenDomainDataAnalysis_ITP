		<content> The parish council, restructured in   
 1965, following County boundary       
 changes, has 7 elected members and    
 meets 6 times a year. The annual      
 precept is Â£850, much of which is     
 spent on electricity for the 3 or 4   
 street lights in each hamlet. Each has
 its own "Festival of Britain" village 
 sign, "Jubilee" seat, Council         
 notice-board and telephone kiosk. Each
 enters the Best Kept Village contest. 
 Staploe in 1963 and Duloe in 1983 won 
 the "Small Village" category. The     
 award trees were planted in the       
 winning hamlets and certificates hang 
 in the Village Hall.                  
 There is a weekly garbage collection  
 and from time to time a skip is       
 provided for larger items.            
 For several years the 10 trees offered
 annually by the County have been      
 planted along roads in the parish.    </content>
