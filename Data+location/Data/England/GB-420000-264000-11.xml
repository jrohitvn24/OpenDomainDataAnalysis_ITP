		<title>11My hobbies - ferreting</title>
		<content> My favourite hobbies are ferreting,   
 fishing and beating.  What you need   
 for ferreting are some nets made out  
 of a special string and my Dad showed 
 me how to make them.  You need a      
 bobbin, string and some copper rings. 
 We have three ferrets and we feed them
 with dead chickens and tripe.  We are 
 lucky because we live in the country  
 and we know a farmer who lets us go   
 ferreting on his fields and along his 
 hedges.  When we find some burrows we 
 put the nets over the holes and we put
 the ferrets down one of the holes and 
 we wait for the rabbits to bolt.  When
 they bolt they get caught in the net. 
 It is not an expensive hobby.
