		<title>20A typical family day (ctd)</title>
		<content> Jake said :"Can I have my dinner now,"
 because it was twelve o'clock.My Dad  
 was eating his at work.Now it was two 
 o'clock and I was busy at school.We   
 were laughing about Alison's story    
 chapter 1 which was called "Building  
 the time machine".Then I heard the    
 bell go so I put up my chair and went 
 home.When I got home I had my tea.    
 After my tea I went out to play with  
 my friend Heather.At 7:30 I had to go 
 in to have my crisps and a drink.     
 Afterwards I went to bed and Jake went
 to bed too.
