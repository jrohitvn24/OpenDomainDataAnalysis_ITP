		<title>20PUBLIC FOOTPATHS IN PARKGATE</title>
		<content>    The area round{Parkgate}is well    
 off for footpaths. There are so many  
 rights of way that it is possible to  
 walk from each of the main villages in
 the area,{Heswall,Neston}and{Thornton 
{Hough}by means of a public footpath   
 only, apart from crossing a main road.
    Since the area is densely populated
 the rights of way are well used. They 
 are kept in reasonable condition by   
 the farmers and are well sign-posted. 
    One of the best is the {Wirral Way.
 This was a railway until{l965.}It was 
 abandoned but was then made into a    
 footpath running from{West Kirby}to   
{Hooton Station.}This is also a{Country
{Park}with a ranger service to keep    
 visitors well informed about the local
 history and wildlife, with lectures   
 and guided walks. It is also popular  
 with{horse riders}as there is a well  
 made bridleway running alongside it.  </content>
