		<content> Housing in the area is varied. On the 
 one hand there are the{original }     
{farmhouses, cottages and village      
{dwellings}which have been built over  
 the last two centuries.               
                                       
 On the other hand there are three     
 areas of{local authority housing}built
 within the past 15 years. These were  
 built to house the large influx of    
 people, largely from London, who came 
 to the area as part of{Andover's New  
{Town Development. }                   
                                       
                                       
 The estates are called King Arthurs   
 Way on which street names are taken   
 from the legend of King Arthur, Roman 
 Way on which street names are taken   
 from the history of the Roman Empire  
 and Cricketers Way on which streets   
 are named after famous cricketers.    </content>
