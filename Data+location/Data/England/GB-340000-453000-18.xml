		<content> The sea and the Lune Estuary dominate 
 Sunderland Point.  The glacial boulder
 clay of the tip of the Point is       
 eroding rapidly through the action of 
 the sea, but parts of the beaches near
 the village are accreting.  Two severe
 storms within l0 years, in l977 and   
 l983, have accelerated the erosion as 
 well as inundating half the houses and
 damaging household belongings and     
 field and garden walls. The estuary is
 silting.  Siltation caused by the     
 construction of river training walls  
 about l00 years ago is almost         
 complete,but a new phase of rapid     
 silting is in progress due to the     
 colonisation of the higher intertidal 
 silt areas by marsh grass, spartina.  
 The only road to the village is tidal 
 being covered for up to 4 hours.      
 The area has many wild plants, and is 
 rich in bird life, particularly waders</content>
