		<content>For adults, outdoor sports and going to
the theatre are very popular but twice 
as many people choose gardening as     
their chief leisure time activity. The 
recently opened "Beckley Snooker Club" 
in Oxford attracts a number of people  
from the area. Amongst other actvities 
mentoned are walking, shooting,        
swimming, music and sailing,           
                                       
Both outdoor sports and cycling are    
very popular with the children. Cubs,  
Brownies, Scouts, Youth Club and       
swimming are also popular. Other       
activities include sailing and skating 
(at the new Oxford Rink.)
