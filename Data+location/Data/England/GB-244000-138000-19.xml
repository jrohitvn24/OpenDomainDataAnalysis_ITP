		<title>19The Thatcher</title>
		<content>   One night we went to interview the  
 Georgeham Thatcher, ( Mr Hummerston ) 
 We got quite a lot of information.The 
 reeds come from Devon and Austria and 
 have to be 12_14 inches thick.        
   He thatches round about 8_12 houses 
 a year.You have to be very skilled to 
 do this job,because Mr Hummerston has 
 had an accident,he fell off his       
 ladder.                               
 It wasn't very serious though.It is   
 very easy to have an accident when    
 you'r doing a dangerous job like this.
 I asked him what tools he used he     
 said,a Binder,a reedcomber for        
 shredding the reeds and a hook to help
 him put the reeds on.Thatching has    
 changed since world war 2,Because the 
 reed wasn't very good,they also used  
 the same tools as we do now.He likes  
 Thatching but the only thing he       
 doesn't like is the weather.          </content>
