		<content> There are some new and some old shops 
 in the centre. Some shops are over    
 100 years old. There is a bank called 
 Barclays which is next to the         
 newsagents. There is a small Co-op so 
 you don't have to go far to get food. 
 The{Post Office}has been opened for   
 60 years. It was built in 1876 and was
 originally two houses which were owned
 by the Victoria Stone Company. The two
 houses were knocked together to form  
 the present building. They sort the   
 mail at the post office and start work
 each day at 6.00am. They are open from
 Monday-Saturday and there are 11      
 collections a week.                   
 The{bread shop}was originally a       
 school. A mallet and trowel were used 
 to lay the foundations in 1873. It has
 been a bread shop for 4 years and they
 also sell cakes,sweets and health     
 foods.                                </content>
