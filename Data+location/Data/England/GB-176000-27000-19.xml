		<content>   Mawnan is an area of outstanding    
 natural beauty containing many        
 differing{habitats}with a variety of  
 wildlife. Few habitats are spoiled but
 many are in endangered through the    
 increase in population especially in  
 the Tourist season. In the{river}boats
 disturb fish,rubbish,oil and sewage   
 pollute the shore.{Farmers}use        
 pesticides but few take down hedges.  
 Most hedge trimming is now done after 
 the flowers have seeded. Many{trees   
 have died with Dutch Elm disease and  
 others around Durgan are coming to the
 end of their natural life. There are  
 little signs of tree planting except  
 for the{National}Trust who own a      
 considerable amount of land. Mawnan   
 won the{Best Kept Village Award}last  
 year. The Cubs,Brownies and Guides    
 help to keep the village tidy while   
 everyone works hard in their gardens. </content>
