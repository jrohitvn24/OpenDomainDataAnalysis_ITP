		<content>  To help his work each day.           
                                       
 But machinery is limited              
 It can't do everything                
 So to some oldfashioned methods       
 The farmer has to cling.              
                                       
 Thus Frank still goes out counting    
 The wintering in his fields;          
 Care is so important _                
 It can affect his yields              
                                       
 One morning,eleven were missing       
 Despite a careful count               
 With sheep the price they are today   
 That is a large amount.               
                                       
 Nine,nine,nine,then dialled Frank     
 The police came round at speed,       
 And the 'tizer journalist             
 Who'd done the dirty deed ?
