		<title>11SATURDAYS IN ST.BRELADE</title>
		<content>  My name is Nicola Maddox.  I am 14.  
 I am writing about what I do on       
 Saturdays.                            
  I start my mornings at 8.00 when I   
 get up.  Then I have a wash and get   
 dressed.  At 8.15 I get my breakfast, 
 which consists of cornflakes and      
 coffee.  At 8.30 I go over to the     
 shops to get our lunch which consists 
 of sausage rolls, crisps, a drink and 
 biscuits.                             
  My Mum takes me to pick Susan up at  
 9.00.  We go to the stable where we   
 get the horses in and tack up.  There 
 are usually 4 rides which I take      
 round.  12.00 is lunch-time.  We groom
 and tack up before 1.30 when we go out
 on the roads before taking the horses 
 to the fields to graze.  When I get in
 at 4 p.m. I shower and watch          
 television until 11.30 p.m. -         
 bed-time!                             </content>
