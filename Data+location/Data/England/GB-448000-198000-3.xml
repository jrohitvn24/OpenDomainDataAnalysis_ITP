		<title>03Farming In North Abingdon</title>
		<content>About two thirds of the block is       
farmland.This compares to about nine   
tenths forty years ago.Farming in those
days after the second world war was    
mostly dairy farming.The farms were    
smaller then but there were many more  
than now.                              
Today there are only 4 farms,mostly    
engaged in mixed farming (livestock and
arable).Peachcroft,which was mainly    
arable,is now moving to mixed farming  
and has a shop on the farm which sells 
its own and other farms produce        
directly to the public.It has some     
livestock(pigs,poultry etc.) and some  
horticulture for people to "pick your  
own"fruit.Nine people work the farm    
including the farmer (Mr.Homewood)his  
wife and two children.The family have  
run the farm since 1933 but it was a   
farm at least as early as 1634.
