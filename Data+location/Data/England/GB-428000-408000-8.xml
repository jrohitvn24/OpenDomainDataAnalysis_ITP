		<content>   Our area is well served by{road}and{
{rail}transport.The dominant feature is
 the M1{motorway}which passes through  
 North/South.The motorway gives quick  
 access to both Sheffield and Leeds.   
 This quick access to major cities has 
 brought about many changes in the way 
 of new housing estates to cater for   
 people who want to live in our        
 semi-rural surroundings and commute to
 work via the motorway.We have a small 
 railway{station}at Darton which is on 
 the main Leeds/Sheffield line.        
   A popular way of getting around     
 is by bus.South Yorkshire Metropolitan
 Council have a transport policy that  
 is heavily subsidised from the rates. 
 For a nominal fee of 10pence,2pence   
 for children,people can travel to     
 Barnsley,our nearest town,5 miles     
 away.Senior citizens are given free,  
 unlimited travel in South Yorkshire.  </content>
