		<title>12Sacred Heart R.C. Church</title>
		<content> Before the 1870's there were very few 
 Roman Catholics in the area but with  
 the beginning of the Iron and Steel   
 industry many Irish Catholics arrived 
 in the area.                          
                                       
 The present church in Lobster Road was
 built in 1917 and serves the west end 
 of Redcar.                            
                                       
 There are two schools linked to the   
 church: a Primary School called St.   
 Dominics and a Secondary School called
 Sacred Heart.
