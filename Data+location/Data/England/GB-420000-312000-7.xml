		<title>07Daily Life -A Farmers Wife</title>
		<content>   Our interviewee is the wife of a    
farmer who owns several hundreds of    
acres of land at Croxall.She lives in a
very large farmhouse and has three     
children.                              
   After getting up at about 7 o'clock 
she prepares a breakfast of bacon      
cooked in a microwave oven and toast   
made in a toaster.She then washes up   
and her husband starts work at about 8 
o'clock. About this time the telephone 
starts ringing with calls about the    
business. The Farmers Wife takes the   
messages and orders the feed and just  
before nine she takes her younger      
daughter to school.                    
  Once a fortnight at 9.30a.m. she     
weighs the bull calves. Most of the    
morning she spends doing housework such
as dusting hoovering and cleaning.She  
eats a snack lunch at 12.30 before     
continuing with the cleaning.          </content>
