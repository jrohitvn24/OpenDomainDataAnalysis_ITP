		<title>07Footpaths Around Stoulton</title>
		<content>     The footpaths on our walk were    
 poorly marked, most of them were      
 overgrown with weeds and obscured by  
 farmers' crops which made them        
 impassable.                           
     Many paths and bridle ways which  
 were shown on the Ordnance Survey Maps
 did not exist.  The footpaths were not
 properly made - they were just dirt   
 tracks, muddy, rough and hard to walk 
 along.  Constant care was needed to   
 avoid ditches, holes and thistles.    
     As we surveyed each plot, we found
 that we were becoming lost because    
 paths on our map existed no longer in 
 reality.  Those that did exist were in
 desperate need of repair.             
     The County Council now has a      
 priority system for re-opening and    
 maintaining the more essential        
 footpaths.                            
                                       </content>
