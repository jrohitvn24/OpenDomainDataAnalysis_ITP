		<content> This is an area of hills rising to    
 150 metres cut by the now dry valleys 
 of rivers which may have flowed when  
 the climate was wetter or when there  
 were rivers of meltwater from the ice 
 sheet near Hemel. The underlying rock 
 is chalk with deposits of clay with   
 flints on some hilltops nearly 3      
 metres thick. In these deposits are   
 found lumps of the Hertfordshire      
 pudding stone. The natural vegetation 
 is grassland with clumps of deciduous 
 trees known locally as 'hangers'. Soil
 varies, but much of the  area is      
 farmed.This is mostly arable with a   
 rotation of cereal, cereal, oilseed   
 rape. The latter crop is used for     
 fodder and for the oil from its seed  
 which makes soap, margarine and       
 cooking oil. The crop has been        
 subsidised by the E.E.C.There are some
 small dairy units.                    </content>
