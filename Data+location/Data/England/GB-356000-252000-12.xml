		<title>12Transport around Pencombe</title>
		<content> Public transport in the map reference 
 is very limited. A local coach firm   
 runs a bus from Pencombe to Bromyard  
 on Thursdays and to Hereford on       
 Wednesdays. A school bus is provided  
 to transport children to secondary    
 school in Bromyard. There is also a   
 taxi service to take children from the
 outlying area to the village school.  
 Most of those living in the area own a
 car and rely on this for their        
 transport.                            
 The area is served by a network of    
 narrow country lanes, which are       
 maintained by Malvern Hills District  
 Council. Problems occur in winter with
 heavy snowfall. On the higher ground  
 lanes may be impassable for some      
 considerable time. In February 1985,  
 the road from Hegdon Hill to Pencombe 
 Cross was blocked for four weeks.
