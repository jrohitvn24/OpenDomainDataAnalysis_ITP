		<title>20CARRWOODS</title>
		<content> Carrwoods are across the road from    
 Bramhall Park and right next to the   
 golf club.There is a stream running   
 all through it with a bridge going    
 over it.At one end there is a tunnel  
 that the stream goes through.There are
 lots of flowers and trees.Some        
 overhang the stream.There are lots of 
 Squirrels to be seen in the Autumn.In 
 the summer families take walks through
 the wood.Sometimes you find golf balls
 from the golf club.Children like      
 throwing stones in the stream.There   
 are banks formed from clay,and at the 
 bottom is the stream.We have visited  
 Carrwoods many times with school to   
 study the wildlife,plants and stream. 
 Carrwoods is an extremely good place  
 for bird spotting and for finding     
 rabbits.
