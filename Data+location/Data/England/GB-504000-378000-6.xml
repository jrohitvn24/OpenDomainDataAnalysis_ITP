		<content> The use of large agricultural         
 machinery has inevitably led to the   
 loss of farm hedgerows. On the largest
 farm in this area an average-sized    
 field is 73 acres. To compensate for  
 this loss 25,000 evergreen and mixed  
 deciduous trees have been planted in  
 suitable locations around the farm.   
 These also afford some cover for the  
 200 pheasants reared and released on  
 to the land each year.                
                                       
 Most of the local farmers rear        
 pheasants and organise shoots in      
 autumn and winter. These are an       
 important social event in the farming 
 community.                            
                                       
 Stainton Wood (owned by a local       
 woodyard) is also used for this       
 purpose.                              
                                       </content>
