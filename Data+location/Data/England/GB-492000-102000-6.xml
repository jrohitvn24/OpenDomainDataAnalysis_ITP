		<content>   The catholic parish of Slindon has  
 two churches. The old church is in    
 Slindon, but as the population        
 expanded in Barnham rather than       
 Slindon a Church was built next to the
 St Philip Howard High School for the  
 use of the school and the parish.About
 10-15 people attend the normal        
 everyday service and about 100 at the 
 Sunday services.There are about 3     
 weddings and 6-7 baptisms a year.     
   The sort of youth clubs and         
 religious groups the church has are:  
 Adult catechesis, Youth catechesis,   
 Liturgy, Ecumenical, Caring groups,   
 Young Mothers group.
