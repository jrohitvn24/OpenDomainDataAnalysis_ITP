		<content> Paull used to be a quiet country      
 village.It hadn't any running water.  
  Turpits lane was called Turpits      
 Pump because there was a water pump at
 the end of it.There were only about   
 50 to 70 houses in the village but    
 that was a long time ago.             
  The shipyard used to be a museum then
 and had exhibits of local folk lore   
 and customs.                          
  The bus service came to Paull in     
 1927 but the biggest change was when  
 water and electricity came to Paull.  
  Men had to get up early to go codding
 and shrimping.                        
    The main street was called Town    
 Street then and all of Paull was      
 called Paghill.Anson Villas got its   
 name from HMS Anson, a ship which took
 soldiers from Paull Battery to fight  
 in the First World War.
