		<content> Six farms agreed to participate in the
 farming survey. The sizes of the farms
 varied from 60 - 150 acres, the       
 largest being the Heathcote and Morson
 farms. All the farms, except Grundey, 
 said their most profitable asset was  
 the dairy cows. Grundey's profit came 
 from beef cattle. Cows, sheep and pigs
 figured also. Although no farm in our 
 area run their farms by means of a    
 computer most had modern farm         
 machinery including tractors, hay     
 makers and baler. Crops are not grown 
 because it is very wet and, because   
 the ground is stoney, there is no     
 depth to the soil. Another factor is  
 that the seasons are very late.       
 Every farmer loved his job. The fresh 
 air and love of the way of life was   
 everything to them.
