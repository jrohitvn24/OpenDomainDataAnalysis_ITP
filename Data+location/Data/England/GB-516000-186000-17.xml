		<content> CHILDREN'S GAMES -{Piggy in the middle
 needs 3 people and a ball. One person 
 stands between the other two and tries
 to catch the ball whilst they throw it
 between them. If the middle person    
 gets it, whoever threw it is then in  
 the middle. {Leapfrog. }One person    
 leans over and puts their hands on    
 their knees. The other person stands  
 facing their side runs and jumps over 
 by putting their hands on the others  
 back. {Pom-Pom. }Any number can play. 
 One person is on and covers their eyes
 and counts to a certain number. The   
 others hide. The person who is on has 
 to try to the others and then goes    
 back to base and shouts 'Pom-Pom 1,   
 2, 3'. The others try to get to base  
 without being seen first though. Other
 games are {Bulldog; skipping;         
{football; hopscotch; cricket; rounders
