		<content>  There is  room used next to the      
 village hall by a doctor from         
 Puckeridge Health Centre for an hour  
 on Monday and Wednesday morning, but  
 there are no facilities to examine    
 you.                                  
  Prescriptions have to be taken and   
 collected from Puckeridge or Bishop's 
 Stortford. Sometimes when you are in  
 Puckeridge the Chemist will ask you to
 deliver medicine to someone in the    
 village.                              
  The school doctor visits school each 
 term and sees every one at least twice
 between the ages of five and          
 eleven.The nurse visits the school    
 regularly and there are hearing, sight
 and dental checks.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
