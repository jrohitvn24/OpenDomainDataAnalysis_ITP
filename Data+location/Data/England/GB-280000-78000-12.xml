		<content> This area is popular because some     
 people stay for holidays, visiting    
 friends or on business. Some people   
 stay in hotels or self catering.      
 People staying in hotels could go to  
 Coombe Cross or The Prestbury. Self   
 caterers can stay at Wooleigh, The Old
 Manse (Bovey Tracey), Hele farm or    
 Frost farm. There are no caravan sites
 as such. Our area has many places to  
 visit. A popular tourist attraction is
 the Rare Breeds Farm. There are also  
 many walks in the area. Becky Falls is
 another attraction close by.Of course 
 the biggest attraction is Dartmoor    
 itself _ Bovey Tracey is known as the 
 Gateway to Dartmoor. Special events   
 such as the carnival also attract     
 visitors. The visitors are mainly     
 British but we also have French,      
 German, Dutch, American and Canadian  
 visitors.                             </content>
