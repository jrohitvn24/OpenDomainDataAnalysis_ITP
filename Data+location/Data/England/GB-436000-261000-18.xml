		<title>18Lifestyles in Ufton Village.</title>
		<content>                                       
  Life in Ufton tends to be quiet      
unless people are prepared to be       
sociable.There is a full programme of  
events which are published every month.
An amenities committee raises money to 
buy things that are needed in the      
community.Older residents are happy    
with the state of affairs although both
old and new residents regret the       
closure of the school.(This is now a   
private home.)                         
  Children travel by bus to Long       
Itchington and Harbury to school-there 
are school bus services.Clubs exist for
recreational purposes such as whist    
drives and bingo.Newer residents tend  
to live in recently renovated buildings
or new detached houses.They have come  
to the village for it's situation and  
commute to work.
