		<title>01GENERAL SURVEY PETT LEVEL</title>
		<content> In this block, nine of the kilometre  
 squares are sea, fished by boats from 
 Rye and Hastings. Only the top left   
 square is completely composed of      
 land, the two adjacent are half       
 sea. The land area sweeps down North  
 to South from the ridge of Pett, farm 
 land, deciduous trees, a few houses to
 the road from Rye to Hastings,over    
 which are the beach and the sea.The   
{Royal Military Canal}ends here. Above 
 it stands Toot Rock, once a tiny      
 island.From Fairlight and the west    
 Pett Level is approached by a cliff   
 path.58 acres of cliff land including 
 Stumblet Wood are in the care of the  
{National Trust,}as are Old Marsham and
 Marsham Farms.The small corner of     
 Sussex in this block is an interesting
 peaceful and pleasant one.
