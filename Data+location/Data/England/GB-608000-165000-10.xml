		<content> In Whitstable there is a recreation   
 ground where people can play on the   
 grass or on swings, slides,           
 roundabouts and climbing frames.      
 There is a massive playing field      
 where there is a football and rugby   
 pitch. Other open grass areas include 
 Tankerton Slopes and Duncan Downs. The
 Castle Grounds are pleasant Gardens   
 for people to walk round. We have     
 amusement arcades, betting shops and  
 bingo halls. The local cinema has     
 recently been turned into a bingo hall
 as local people prefer to watch videos
 at home. There is the Play House where
 concerts and plays are performed.     
 There are three clubs for servicemen  
 and for people who enjoy nature and   
 animals. Also there is a Natural      
 History Society, a flower club, a dog 
 training club,an 18+ Group,a citizens 
 advice bureau and a wine club.        </content>
