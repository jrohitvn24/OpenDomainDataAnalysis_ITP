		<title>09NEWS BALLOON FLIGHT</title>
		<content> ON SATURDAY 15TH JUNE 1985 I WENT TO  
 PARK HOUSE WHICH IS ON THE OUTSKIRTS  
 OF RAVENSTONEDALE. ANTHONY GIBSON WHO 
 WORKS FOR BRITISH AIRWAYS PILOTED THE 
 BALLOON. WHEN THEY MANAGED TO BLOW THE
 BALLOON UP WITH A FAN AND HOT AIR,    
 ABOUT 5 CHILDREN WENT UP AT A TIME.   
 THEY WENT UP AND CAME DOWN RATHER     
 FAST.                                 
 A LINE TETHERED THE BALLOON I THOUGHT 
 IT WAS FANTASTIC AND I WISH I HAD WON 
 FIRST PRIZE IN THE RAFFLE. THE PRIZE  
 FOR THAT WAS A HALF HOUR FLIGHT AND A 
 BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE. THAT NIGHT I HAD 
 A NIGHTMARE. I WAS IN A TETHERED      
 BALLOON AND THE ROPE SNAPPED.I NEARLY 
 FELL OUT BUT JUST MANAGED TO HANG ON  
 TO THE SNAPPED ROPE. IT STARTED GOING 
 DOWN THE RIVER. IT HIT THE WATER AND  
 THE WIND TOOK THE BALLOON AND IT GOT  
 STUCK IN A TREE THEN I WOKE UP.       
                                       </content>
