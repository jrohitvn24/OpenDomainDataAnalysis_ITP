		<title>18Women's Institute Illston</title>
		<content> The Women's Institute holds meetings  
 in Illston Village Hall every second  
 Thursday of the month.                
 The membership is at present 42       
 ladies.  These range greatly in age   
 and also in interests, but all share a
 common interest in friendship and     
 homelife.                             
 Meetings usually take the form of     
 Institute business, put to the floor  
 by the President of the Institute,    
 followed by a guest speaker.          
 Speakers talk to members on all types 
 of subjects, including travel,        
 cookery, needlework, antiques, almost 
 anything which might be of interest.  
 Refreshments follow the speaker and   
 people have time to socialize.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
