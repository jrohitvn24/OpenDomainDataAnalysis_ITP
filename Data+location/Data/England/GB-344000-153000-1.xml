{Cheddar}is a large and pretty village 
 at the foot of the{Mendips.}It has a  
 population of about 4000 who live here
 permanently but a lot more in the     
 summer when lots of{tourists}visit the
 village to look at the{gorge,}the     
{caves}and the{hills,}and other{places 
{of interest.}Cheddar is famous for {  
{cheese,strawberries and cream.}Many   
 people work in the{tourist industry,

 strawberry growing.There are three    
 schools,First,Middle and Upper School,
 lots of shops and six churches.There  
 are three caravan sites,a Youth Hostel
 and several hotels,cafes and guest    
 houses.We think it is a lovely place  
 to live because it has everything we  
 need,lots of things to see and lots of
 things to do.
