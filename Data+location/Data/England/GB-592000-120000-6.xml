		<title>06The Market in Rye</title>
		<content>  On Thursday 23rd of May 1985 our     
 group went to ask questions in the    
 market. The market is held every      
 Thursday in Rye and it is a general   
 market. We asked questions such as do 
 you live in Rye, East Guildford or    
 Playden? Or are you a visitor? We     
 found that a third were local people, 
 a third came from nearby villages, and
 a third were visitors to the town.    
 After this we asked what extra stalls 
 do you think are needed? Most people  
 wanted more food stalls and five      
 people said more clothes stalls. One  
 person said a plant stall would be    
 nice.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
