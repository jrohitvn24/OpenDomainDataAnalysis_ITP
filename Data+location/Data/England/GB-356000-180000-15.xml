		<title>15Vandalism in Patchway</title>
		<content> In our school we have a swimming pool,
 but the vandals keep throwing things  
 into our pool. Vandals are people who 
 go around breaking other peoples      
 property. In our school there are some
 goal posts. Vandals swing on them till
 they crack. Our sports shed was broken
 into by vandals. We had bats and balls
 stolen. The door was unlocked by a    
 tool of some sort. The girls changing 
 room has got a hole in the roof       
 because of some vandals. We have a new
 cover on our pool and a net to go over
 it to stop vandals from throwing      
 things in.                            
  I think they do vandalism because    
 they are bored. We could stop         
 vandalism by having more police on    
 guard or having alarms. I think they  
 mostly do vandalism in the evenings   
 because there are not many people     
 about.                                </content>
