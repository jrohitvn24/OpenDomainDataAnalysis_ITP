		<content>  The{Artisans, Labourers and General  
{Dwellings Company Housing}is the real 
 name for Artizan's Housing. This      
 company is said to be one of the most 
 successful housing companies ever.    
 Between 1865 and 1905, this company   
 solved London's housing problems      
 although its founder, William Austin, 
 could not even read or write.         
  Artizan semi-detached houses in      
{Pinner,}built during the 1930's, are  
 quite large and spacious, containing  
 three bedrooms, two reception rooms, a
 kitchen, a bathroom and a lavatory.   
 They have{high pitched roofs}with one 
{main chimney}and a{side chimney.}Among
 the tiles are some glass ones which   
 act as a{skylight}for the attic.      
 Although they were very modern for    
 their time, they still used the old   
{sash windows}instead of the newer     
 casement windows.                     </content>
