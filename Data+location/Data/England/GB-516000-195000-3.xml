		<title>03BLOOD PRODUCTS LABORATORY</title>
		<content> The present work is done in huts and  
 temporary laboratories. A new building
 is being erected with an April-May    
 1986 completion date. Because this new
 laboratory lies between two reservoirs
 it is being built on a platform       
 supported by 30 metre concrete piles. 
    The Laboratory takes delivery of   
{plasma}which has been collected from  
 all the main{Blood Donor Centres}in   
 England and Wales. With various       
 treatments the plasma is broken down  
 into its different{components}or      
{'fractions'.}Haemophiliacs rely on    
 the blood clotting agent{'Factor 8'   
 which this establishment supplies.    
 Other products include{anti-tetanus}  
 and {anti-mumps}vaccines.             
    New products are being discovered  
 all the time and research to find a   
 treatment for the immune-deficiency   
 disease{AIDS}is a current priority.   </content>
