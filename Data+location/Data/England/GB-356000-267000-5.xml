   At{ 68 Berrington Road}some people  
 heard footsteps every night across    
 the bedroom floor and it was very     
 spooky.                               
  At{Church House}when you went to bed 
 and you turned out the light you felt 
 someone hitting you.                  
  One day some people were walking down
 the road and they saw a tall lady     
 dressed in green.They passed her and  
 she called out to them,they looked    
 round and she was gone.               
  During{the great flood}of Tenbury    
 Miss Griffin went into the local      
 Church and saw a ghost.She was        
 watching the choir boys singing and   
 asked Mr.Howard the organist to look  
 behind him,and he saw a figure of a   
 man gliding over the pews and he went 
 right through the font and            
 disappeared.                          </content>
