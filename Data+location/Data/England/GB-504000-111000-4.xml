		<content> There are three farms in the area.    
 Parham, Kithurst, and Springhead      
 covering flatland and Downland.  The  
 valley bottom is cultivated and the   
 Downs are mainly used for grazing with
 land to the south beyond the South    
 Downs Way again cropped.              
 The livestock is mainly dairy herds,  
 Friesian with some store cattle and   
 sheep on enclosed grazing.            
 Crops grown are winter wheat and      
 barley with some kale and rape. The   
 cereal crops are harvested by combine 
 and carted in open trailers to the    
 drying sheds. Stubble is fired.       
 Ploughing and re-sowing follows.      
 Early grass is cut for silage for     
 winter fodder, and the fields then    
 grazed.
