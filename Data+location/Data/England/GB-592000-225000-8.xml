		<title>08THE ORPEN PLAYERS,W.BERGHOLT</title>
		<content>     DURING THE SUMMER OF 1969 A FEW   
 WEST BERGHOLT RESIDENTS CALLED A      
 PUBLIC MEETING WITH THE OBJECT OF     
 ORGANISING VARIOUS SOCIAL ACTIVITIES  
 WITHIN THE VILLAGE.IT WAS FROM THIS   
 GATHERING THAT THE{'ORPEN PLAYERS' }  
 WAS BORN,SO NAMED BECAUSE THE VENUE   
 FOR THE PERFORMANCES WOULD BE THE     
 ORPEN MEMORIAL HALL. IN NOVEMBER THE  
 FIRST PRODUCTION WAS STAGED.THE       
 SUCCESS OF THIS VENTURE SPURRED THEM  
 ON AND NOW SOME SIXTEEN YEARS LATER   
 THEY CAN LOOK BACK WITH JUSTIFIABLE   
 PRIDE ON THEIR ACHIEVMENTS.THE YEARS  
 HAVE BEEN BUSY ONES WITH THIRTY TWO   
 PLAYS PERFORMED,EIGHT 'OLD TYME MUSIC 
 HALLS' AND TEN PANTOMIMES.THEY HAVE   
 GAINED AN ASSORTMENT OF ACCOLADES     
 ALONG THE WAY AND ACLAIM FROM VARIOUS 
 'CRITICS'.SOME MEMBERS PARTICIPATE AT 
 THE COLCHESTER TATTOO AND CARNIVAL.
