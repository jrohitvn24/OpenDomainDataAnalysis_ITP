		<title>09MARSH HOUSE</title>
		<content> Marsh House is a{play centre}for      
 children aged 5-16.It has an{adventure
{playground}that the Leader built by   
 himself,and it did not cost one penny.
 The house has a cafe in it.The Play   
 Centre is{under threat}because of new 
 Council regulations;the Council won't 
 pay,so the Leader is doing some{fund  
{raising}himself.We asked the Leader   
 some questions and found out that he  
 worked here "because I like being     
 outside and with children".The average
 age of the children is between{10-12  
 yrs and most attend between{4-6 pm}on 
 school days.They come becuase there's 
 not much to do at home and they want  
 to run about.A lot of the children    
 come from{blocks of flats}at Marsh    
 Farm,Hockwell and Limbury.The children
 mix quite well and there most popular 
 item in the playground is the Maze.   
 Groups can hire the playground.       </content>
