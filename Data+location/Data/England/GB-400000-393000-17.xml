		<title>17GLOSSOPDALE A COTTON WORKER</title>
		<content>{Mr. Nixon}is an old gentleman who     
 lives in{Hadfield}and who has spent   
 most of his working-life here in the  
{mills.}He moved here in{1929}when many
 Lancashire mills were closing owing to
 a slump in trade.{Mills}in this area  
 were being equipped with more modern  
 automatic looms . At first he worked  
 at Waterside Mill as a weaver for 10  
 hours a day but over the years the    
 hours were gradually reduced and      
 conditions at work were improved. The 
 hours were still long and the pay 'not
 great'.In{hard times}of no work they  
 only had 6 weeks of{benefit money.    
 After several years he became an      
{apprentice overlooker.}The mill owners
 asked him to stay on because he was a 
 good worker. He{retired}at 69 shortly 
 before the mill *closed. He was sad to
 leave the cotton industry and to see  
 so many mills close.  *see p13        </content>
