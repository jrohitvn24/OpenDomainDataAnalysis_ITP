		<title>13COUNCILLOR JAMES (MARKS TEY)</title>
		<content>{Mr James}has lived in Marks Tey for 17
 years , but he is no ordinary 59 year 
 old . He is Chairman of the Parish    
 Council ,a  Borough Councillor  , a   
 School Governor and probably the most 
 important,ex Mayor of Colchester(1982)
  He was very proud to be Mayor of the 
 oldest recorded town and it gave him  
 an opportunity to do good for         
 Colchester, to visit places and to    
 meet people.On  the Parish and Borough
 Councils his job is to put forward the
 views of the local people and to see  
 that everything runs smoothly for     
 them. His  job was a safety officer   
 with British Rail . He and his family 
 moved to Marks Tey because of the good
 cmmunications, the countryside and the
 house prices.  He got into local      
 politics because he felt that the     
 views of the new housing were not     
 represented.         (A.Hall)         </content>
