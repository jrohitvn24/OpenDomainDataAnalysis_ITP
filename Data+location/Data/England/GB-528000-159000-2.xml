		<title>02Stefan's Day - Purley</title>
		<content>   Hello, my name is Stefan. I live in 
 Purley. I wake up at about 7.00am and 
 get changed into my school uniform.   
 For breakfast I have cornflakes, egg, 
 toast and a cup of coffee.            
   At about 8.00am Dad and my sister go
 in the car to Croydon. He drops my    
 sister off at her school and he goes  
 to work. He is an insurance inspector.
 Jeffrey, my friend calls for me on the
 way to school. Three-quarters of the  
 way there mum goes to work at         
 playschool. Then we go to school.     
   We do some maths and reading, then  
 we have lunch. In the afternoon we do 
 Art and Craft, sometimes singing and a
 story. We go home at 3.15pm.          
   At home I play on my computer or    
 watch T.V. My sister is home at 4.30pm
 and Dad at 6.00pm. We have supper     
 at 6.00pm and I go to bed at 9.00pm.  
   I like 1985.                        </content>
