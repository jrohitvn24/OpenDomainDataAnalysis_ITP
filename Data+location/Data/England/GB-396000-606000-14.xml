		<content> There has been very little building of
 houses in Netherton for many years.6  
 two-storied stone-fronted houses were 
 built by the Local Authority about 25 
 years ago.                            
       In the last 5 years three new   
 detached bungalows have been built,all
 on separate sites. These have been    
 built with composite stone.           
   There are now plans in the pipe-line
 for 10 new houses for letting and two 
 private bungalows in the field  north 
 east of the junction with the Alnwick,
 Whittingham road.                     
        Many of the farm cottages no   
 longer used for farm workers are let  
 as week-end or holiday cottages.
