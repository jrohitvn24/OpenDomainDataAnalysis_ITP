		<title>08WILDLIFE IN FENDRAYTON FEN</title>
		<content>    {Fendrayton Fen}is mostly          
 farmland though some of it is disused 
 gravel pits. The gravel pits being    
 disused are now overgrown and attract 
 lots of wild birds and mammals.       
     When I went up there I saw plenty 
 of{Wigeon}and{Moorhens}on the pits.   
     In the middle of one of the pits  
 there is an island with a{Silver      
{Birch Tree}on it:up the birch tree,   
 roosting there were{Lapwings.         
     When I was there in February I saw
 two{Foxes}a male and a female.February
 is the end of the mating season for   
 foxes so about July their cubs are    
 just going out into the wild.         
   Another time I was there with my dad
 (at night)in the car we swung around  
 the corner fast and saw all these     
 rabbits running away from the lights. 
     I think the{wild life of the fen} 
 is very varied and interesting.       </content>
