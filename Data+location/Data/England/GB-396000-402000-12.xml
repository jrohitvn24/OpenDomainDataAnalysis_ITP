		<content> Mossley and Stalybridge annual Wakes  
 holiday period covers the last two    
 weeks of July and serves as a reminder
 of the years when all Industry  closed
 down and the population disappeared to
 the seaside. With the present         
 unemployment situation (over 20       
 percent) and the loss of traditional  
 industries in the area, Mossley Wakes 
 is not what it was. There is still the
 Wakes Fair on the Market Ground and   
 the Annual tour of the area by the    
 Saddleworth and Mossley Morrismen.    
 Morris Dancing has, over the last few 
 years, had something of a revival with
 new groups being formed almost        
 annually. The interest has extended   
 into the schools with Micklehurst     
 Junior School having a                
 well-established boys dancing team.
