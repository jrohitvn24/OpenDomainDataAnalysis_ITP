 COMES INTO MY ROOM, WAKES ME UP AND   
 LEAVES TO GO DOWN STAIRS. I LIE ON MY 
 BACK WISHING I COULD GO BACK TO SLEEP 
 FOR THE WHOLE DAY. FIVE MINUTES LATER 
 DAD COMES TO GET ME OUT OF BED. I PULL
 TOGETHER MY STRENGTH AND SCRAMBLE OUT 
 OF BED. I TOTTER INTO THE BATHROOM AND
 HAVE A GOOD WASH IN ICE COLD WATER TO 
 WAKE ME UP. THE WATER GIVES ME NUMB   
 HANDS BUT AFTER A COUPLE OF RUBS THEY 
 START TO COME TO LIFE. I WALK BACK TO 
 MY BEDROOM DRESSING AS I GO. WHEN I AM
 DRESSED I GO DOWN STAIRS AND INTO THE 
 DINING ROOM.  I STAND ON THE EDGE OF  
 THE SETTEE WITH BRUSH AND COMB AND    
 LOOK IN THE MIRROR TO BRUSH MY HAIR.  
 MUM ASKS WHETHER I WANT TOAST OR      
 CEREAL AND I ALWAYS SAY TOAST.AT
