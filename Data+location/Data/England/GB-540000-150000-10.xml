		<title>10HOUSING IN HURST GREEN</title>
		<content>{ Hurst Green} is small and compacted  
 and has about 2,000 houses. Many of   
 the houses are semi-detatched and were
 built between 1947 and 1960. 70% of   
 the houses are large and have plenty  
 of space, 20% are old peoples flats   
 and a further 9% are flats,the        
 remaining 1% are bungalows. About     
 75% of the houses around this area    
 were built by the County Council and  
 the other 25% were built by various   
 other private building companies. Alot
 of the area is made up by new building
 estates,for example{Barnfield Way,}   
 which was once a field. All of the{   
{Greenways}is now a building estate but
 was once all woodland. Many other new 
 houses have been built in small spaces
 available.
