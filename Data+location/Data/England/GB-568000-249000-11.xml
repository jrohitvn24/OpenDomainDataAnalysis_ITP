		<title>11Hill Farm,Barnardiston,</title>
		<content> Hill farm and Frenches farm have been 
 owned by the Horsley family for about 
 100 years.During recent alterations to
 Frenches farmhouse,Roman remains were 
 found.                                
   Wheat,barley and oil-seed rape are  
 grown and many modern machines are    
 used for drilling,spraying  and       
 lifting.The harvest is a very busy    
 time as the crops have to be dried and
 stored to keep them in top condition. 
   Andrew Horsley is very conscious of 
 conservation and has invested in a    
 machine which ploughs the stubble back
 into the ground instead of farmers    
 having to burn it,as has been the     
 custum recently.He has also planted   
 several small woods to replace dead   
 elms and give cover for game birds.   
   Mr.Horsley keeps a herd of Friesan  
 cows and some Highland cattle.
