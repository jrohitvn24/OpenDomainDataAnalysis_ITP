		<title>17BLO'NORTON CHURCH.</title>
		<content>   There has been a church on the site 
 of St. Andrew's Church, Blo'Norton    
 since before the Domesday Book of 1087
 although no part of the present       
 building is that old, dating as it    
 does from the 13th century. The church
 fabric is not in a good state of      
{REPAIR,}the tower being unsafe and the
 bells thus inoperative. Money is      
 available for repairs and work is due 
 to start in 1986.                     
   A true community spirit is not      
 helped by the scattered nature of the 
 parish but members take an active     
 part in the social activities of the  
 village. There is a weekly service and
 regular{UNITED SERVICES}with adjacent 
 Garboldisham Church.                  
   The church has been associated in   
 the past with{PRINCE}Frederick Duleep 
 Singh who lived for some time at the  
 Hall and is buried in the Churchyard. </content>
