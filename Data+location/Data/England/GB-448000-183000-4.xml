		<title>04 ---Chilton Village-1925----</title>
		<content>  The people in the village, although  
poor, did have employment at one of the
3 racing stables or 3 farms near the   
village.                               
  The staple diet of villagers was lamb
tail pie,rook pie, rabbit pie, streaky 
bacon and cheese.                      
  The village had 1 public house, the  
Rose and Crown, in the name of Edwards.
Mrs.Edwards was from the Vinton family.
  The school had 2 classes. Once a week
children were taken by taxi to Harwell-
the boys to do woodwork, the girls to  
do cookery. The children played games  
like tip-cat, spinning top, hop-scotch 
and hide and seek.                     
  Villagers were able to visit Didcot  
twice a week or Abingdon once a week   
by bus, but the roads were very        
poor.There was a local train service   
to Newbury.
