		<title>06SAND BAY AND SEA DEFENCES</title>
		<content> Flooding from the sea has been a      
 factor of life for the people living  
 close to the shore at Kewstoke and    
 Sand Bay.  Worlebury Hill channels the
 frequent  high winds and gales that   
 are so prevalent in the area.         
 December 1981 saw the most serious    
 flooding and damage to property of    
 this century.  Many  seaside          
 properties suffered serious damage.   
 After examining the alternatives it   
 was decided to create a slope from the
 shoreline using sand and gravel that  
 was to be dredged from the Bristol    
 Channel.  In the initial letter to the
 residents of the area the Wessex Water
 Authority indicated that 600,000 tons 
 of sand and gravel would be required  
 for the 2km stretch of beach.  The    
 work began  in the middle of 1983 and 
 completed by the end of January 1984.
