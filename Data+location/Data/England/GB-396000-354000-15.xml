		<title>15LEEK ARM OF THE CALDON CANAL</title>
		<content>The Leek arm of the Caldon Canal which 
was officially re-opened on 3rd April  
1985,was built by James Renaie in      
1901.He also constructed Rudyard       
Lake,the largest man-made lake on      
British Waterways.                     
The canal has a tunnel 130 yards long  
which was closed to navigation because 
it had become dangerous.The cost of the
repair work was 200,000 pounds.It      
was started in July 1984 and finished  
one month ahead of schedule.A group of 
local people who formed the Caldon     
Canal Society have worked since 1961 to
achieve this aim.
