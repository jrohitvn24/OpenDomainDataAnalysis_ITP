		<title>17TRANSPORT IN CHITTERNE</title>
		<content> The only public transport serving the 
 area is a single deck bus which runs  
 between Chitterne and Warminster, via 
 Codford on Tuesday, Thursday, Friday  
 and Saturday, leaving at 9.O5 a.m.,   
 returning from Warminster at 11.55    
 a.m. On Friday there is an additional 
 service in the afternoon, leaving at  
 1.3O p.m., returning at 5 p.m. To     
 travel to other places connecting bus 
 services are available, though not    
 very frequent, at Codford and         
 Warminster. Anyone working away has to
 have their own transport, consequently
 many families have two or more cars.  
 Traffic problems through Chitterne are
 caused by heavy stone carrying lorries
 speeding through the village on the   
 B39O road.
