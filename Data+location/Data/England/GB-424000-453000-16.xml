		<title>16AMY'S FAMILY WEEKEND-SAT.</title>
		<content> As no one works at the weekend we all 
 stay longer in bed and I got up at    
 10.00am.I got washed,dressed and had  
 breakfast. Then I played with my Sindy
 dolls and the cat. As it was nice I   
 went out into the garden and played   
 tennis with my brother John. After our
 dinner of sandwiches and cake I played
 catch with my dad and John. Then he   
 played on his motor bike so I played  
 dressing up. We were having a         
 barbacue for tea so I helped mum to   
 do the steak,spare ribs and kebabs.   
 After tea we all went to Little       
 Almscliffe,to have a walk , then came 
 back for bedtime. Dad read story and  
 then I went to sleep.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
