		<content>The smell of pig was in the air as we  
approached the pig farm. The man who   
owned it greeted us and gave us some   
information about his 2500 odd pig     
farm. He showed us some pigs and we    
noticed that one had foam around its   
mouth,as if it had a shave. Then we    
went in to see the sows. One had had   
a litter the night before with two     
healthy piglets, looking just like     
silk. All of those sows were in heated 
quarters. The day starts on the farm at
7.30.a.m. when the men arrive. There   
are 200 sows and they eat 1.2 tons of  
feed each,during a year.The food is a  
compound of cereal,fish and vitamins.  
Each piglet will eat nearly 400 pounds 
of food before they are sent to market 
at Lichfield or sent to the bacon      
factory.We had disturbed the pigs, so  
we thanked the farmer and left.
