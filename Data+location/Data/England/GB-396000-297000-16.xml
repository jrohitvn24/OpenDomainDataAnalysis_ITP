		<title>16Religion_ Hindu Samaj Mandal</title>
		<content> The West Midlands is an area with a   
 rich mixture of cultures and          
 religions. Within a few miles of each 
 other, the visitor can see a variety  
 of places of worship, including those 
 of Hindu, Sikh, and Muslim faiths as  
 well as many Christian Churches.      
 Hindu Samaj Mandal in Salisbury Street
 was dedicated in June 1985. This      
 marked another step in the progress of
 the temple, which began in a          
 semi_detached house in 1972. The      
 present building is very extensive and
 has been carefully converted to serve 
 the needs of the local Hindu          
 population. Two acts of worship are   
 performed each day. Sunday is regarded
 as the most holy day of the week. The 
 temple has facilities for weddings,   
 and festivals are celebrated          
 throughout the year.
