		<title>06Poringland Business</title>
		<content> Poringland has several shops,but Stoke
 has none.We did a shop survey on      
 peoples shopping habbits at the local 
 stores.Most of the people we spoke to 
 agreed that the shops in Poringland   
 were adequate for their daily needs.  
 Most people bought their clothes and  
 more select items not sold in the     
 local stores,in Norwich.The owner of a
 shop told us that the shop was started
 in 1924 by her father-in-law.It has   
 always been a general store but used  
 to be a self service shop as it is    
 today. Surprisingly,a fashionable herb
 store has also been set up,and is     
 finding considerable local interest.  
 Other businesses include builders,    
 undertakers,electricians,hairdressers,
 financial services and chimney sweeps.
