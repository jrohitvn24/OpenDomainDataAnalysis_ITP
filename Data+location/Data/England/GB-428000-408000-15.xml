		<content>   Darton is the largest settlement in 
 our area and accounts for the largest 
 proportion of its population.The      
 remaining land area is mainly         
 agricultural with the odd isolated    
 farmstead and numerous small villages.
  {Census}figures for 1984 tell us that
 the area had a population of          
 approximately 9764 people.From these  
 figures we can pick out general trends
 about population.The{birthrate}for    
 example is falling and this is shown  
 by falling roles in our local schools.
   The highest proportion of people in 
 our area are between 45 and 64 years  
 of age.In addition to this we noted   
 that there were more females over the 
 age of 75 than males.In the 0 to 4 age
 group more males than females are     
 born.Many people are{migrating,}      
 possibly due to the lack of jobs.
