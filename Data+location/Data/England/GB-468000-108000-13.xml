		<title>13BATTERNS WAY</title>
		<content> I live in a street called Battens Way 
 and there is a rumour that our street 
 has been built on a Roman Graveyard.  
 There is a Community Center where     
 there is a disco on Thursday from 5pm 
 to 7pm:a judo club, a cafe, a drinks  
 bar, Jumble sales,and picture shows   
  In my area vandalism is terrible.    
 People spray paint on things. Such as 
 subways and smash shop windows. People
 throw their rubbish anywhere they want
 to.Near the shops in Park Parade there
 is a lot of "popping"and "breaking"   
 (that is a new form of  dancing),they 
 use flat cardboard boxes to lie on    
 their backs and spin. There are       
 a lot of glue sniffers,and often      
 fights break out.                     
    There are lots of Football teams in
 Leigh Park. One is called Leigh Park  
 United.It is for under Elevens.
