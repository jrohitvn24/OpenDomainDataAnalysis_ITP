		<title>06LOCAL AMENITIES.</title>
		<content>     Children from the fourth year sent
 out forms asking local people what    
 amenities they would like to see      
 provided in Sheringham. Two hundred   
 forms were delivered and thirty nine  
 returned (19.5%) which was very       
 disappointing. The people came in the 
 following age groups:-                
 under 20           {2                 
 between 20 and 40 {11                 
 between 40 and 60  {7                 
 over 60           {19                 
 Despite the differences in ages 35 out
 of the 39 wanted Sheringham to have a 
 swimming pool.  There are plans being 
 discussed at the moment by the Council
 to have a pool in the town, but it    
 would mean having a supermarket on the
 car park to help pay for it (it would 
 cost Â£2,000,000). A lot of people are 
 against this but when we move schools 
 we will lose our school pool.         </content>
