 Sharlston since the 1890's. Their     
 ground is called "Back o' t' wall"    
 which is next to the Sharlston Hotel  
 on Weeland Road. All their games ara  
 on a Sunday morning. They have a squad
 of 25 players. The captain is R.      
 Maskill. Officials include a coach,   
 treasurer, secretary and six on the   
 committee. They have a famous         
 reputation for producing good players.
 In 1946 they beat Workington Town at  
 home in the Challenge Cup. This year  
 the played 23 games and finished 2nd  
 in the local amateur league. Player of
 the year was P. Harrison. A lot of    
 local people support the team and     
 social events such as raffles are run 
 in the Sharlston Hotel and the Vill   
 and Sharlston clubs in order to raise 
 money.
