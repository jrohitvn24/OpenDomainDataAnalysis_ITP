		<title>09FESTIVALS IN GRETTON</title>
		<content>Festivals are held regularly in the    
village at various times of the year.  
The first one is the May Fair at the   
Primary School when a May Queen is     
crowned and Maypole Dancing takes      
place.  There are also stalls and P.E. 
displays.  During the summer months    
both Churches hold Flower Festivals,   
when the numerous visitors can         
appreciate the many displays           
representing different themes from the 
Bible.  From the donations given by the
visitors the Churches raise much money.
The school and both Churches also hold 
Harvest Festivals and give the proceeds
to charity.  On the nearest Sunday to  
11th. November a Festival of Rememb-   
rance is held to honour the men who    
died in the two world wars.  Services  
are held at either the Parish Church   
or the Baptist Church followed by the  
laying of wreathes on the war memorial.</content>
