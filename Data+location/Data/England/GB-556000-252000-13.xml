		<content> One resident who was interviewed lives
 in a little cottage with pretty       
 pattened windows which overlooks one  
 of the farms. He has lived there for  
 sixty-three years and his parents were
 there before him. A photo of his      
 grandfather hangs on the wall of the  
 sittingroom. For the first time in    
 forty-four years, since he has been   
 keeping bees, he has no honey. He     
 thinks it was the cold spring which   
 kept them in the hives. In past years 
 he has produced large quantities from 
 a dozen or so hives, but this year,   
 not so much as a jar. His hives need a
 bit of attention, but he has been too 
 busy with his gardening jobs locally  
 and with his own acre, that the work  
 has been left.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
