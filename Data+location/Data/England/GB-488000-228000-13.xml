 The{Three Locks}were built in 1868 and
 finished in 1879 following which      
 the canalside pub was built in 1905   
 but it was originally just a hay barn 
 for the horses then after it became a 
 pub for the barges. The latest manager
 has been there for two years. He lives
 in the pub.{The canalman}doesn't live 
 in the boat and he is a foreman       
 builder.He is on the canal because    
 he's on his annual holiday. He has no 
 children. He saysthe water is cleaner 
 since the last time he came. He drops 
 in at all the pubs and he says this   
 one has good service. For his holiday 
 he and his wife set off from          
 Bletchley and have been to Aylesbury. 
 They have been going for four days. It
 is easy to steer the barge. He uses   
 diesel fuel and a tank full will run  
 for 50 hours.                         </content>
