       Both Nawton and Wombleton have a
 village shop which is seen to be      
 valuable for the purchase of everyday 
 items. A small shop selling children's
 clothing recently opened in Nawton. It
 replaced a butcher's shop.            
       Villagers do their weekly       
 shopping increasingly at large        
 supermarkets in Pickering, Malton and 
 York.                                 
       Kirkbymoorside and Helmsley have
 weekly markets which attract a large  
 number of villagers.                  
       Mobile vans selling meat, bread 
 and groceries tour the area and       
 provide an important service          
 especially for the elderly and those  
 without transport.
