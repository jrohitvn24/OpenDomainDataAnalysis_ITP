		<content>  Our D-Block is agricultural land with
 the villages of Mowsley in the West   
 and Laughton in the East. Leicester   
 City is about 12 miles North. Most of 
 the land is above 125 metres, the     
 highest point is 168 metres. The{     
{landscape}is attractive rolling hills 
 of loam, clay, and gravel containing  
 many{springs.}Between the villages is 
 a sewage plant, and within the block  
 are Laughton and Gumley cricket       
 pitches. The villages have Anglican   
 churches; Mowsley has a small primary 
 school and a pub.                     
  The Mowsley to Laughton road is      
 crossed by the North/South road from  
 Saddington to Theddingworth. A road   
 also leads East to Lubenham. The area 
 is crossed by two streams and the     
 Grand Union{Canal.}In the North is the
 tip of Saddington{reservoir}used for  
 leisure and refilling the canal.      </content>
