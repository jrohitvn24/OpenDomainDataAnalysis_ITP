		<title>05Sunday in Clayton-le-Woods</title>
		<content>   On a Sunday in Clayton-le-Woods we  
 get up early and get ready to go to   
 church to sing to God.                
   Most christenings are held on Sunday
 to celebrate the baby as a Christian  
 and part of the family. We sing to God
 to thank him for the world we live on 
 and share. We also thank God for food 
 and drink without them we would not   
 live. After church we go home for our 
 Sunday dinner. For dinner on Sunday   
 we have roast potatoes, lamb, boiled  
 potatoes, peas, carrots, cabbage or   
 cauliflower with gravy poured all over
 them.                                 
   When we have finished our dinner we 
 go out for a ride in the car. When we 
 come home it is nearly our bed-time so
 we get ready for bed then go to sleep 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
