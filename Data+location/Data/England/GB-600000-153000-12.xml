 Most houses in the area are situated  
 along the main A25l road and around   
 Badlesmere Lees.  Most property is    
 owner occupied.  Many old houses have 
 been modernised, varying in size from 
 large farm houses to rows of cottages,
 once occupied by farmworkers.  Most of
 the modernisation has successfully    
 retained the original character of the
 old houses and such property is much  
 sought after.  The few new buildings  
 which are mainly bungalows or chalet  
 style houses have been built in small 
 groups.  There is little rented       
 accommodation apart from a row of     
 council houses by Leaveland Church and
 some council owned old peoples'       
 bungalows on Badlesmere Lees. Tight   
 planning controls restrict new        
 development.
