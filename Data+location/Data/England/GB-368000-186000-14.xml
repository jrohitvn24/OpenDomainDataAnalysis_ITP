{The traffic survey}showed that mostly 
 cars used the main road. There were   
 more vans than lorries. Other vehicles
 made up only a small proportion of the
 traffic.                              
{Some local people}are very concerned  
 about the level of traffic. They are  
 concerned about the speed of cars     
 going through the village and the     
 number of heavy lorries which cause   
 the most noise and damage. This       
 problem has become worse in the last  
 year since new distribution depots    
 have opened at Yate.                  
{An action group}has been together with
 the people of Cromhall. The group is  
 pressing for a number of improvements:
 a speed limit, a by-pass or rerouting 
 of heavy vehicles.
