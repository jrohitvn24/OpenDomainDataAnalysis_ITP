		<content> My name is Sheryl.  My Mum gets up at 
 about 7:30 a.m. We have {7 rooms}and  
 space for {16 or 18 guests}.  Mum does
 a cooked breakfast with fruit juice or
 cornflakes for starters.  The guests  
 also have a pot of tea and toast. For 
 dinner we have something different    
 every day.  Guests can sit in the     
 front room any time they like.        
                                       
 We have a hatch from the kitchen into 
 the dining room.  We also have a bath 
 and shower with a toilet and two other
 toilets.  We have our own lounge and a
 little shed; we use the shed as a     
 bedroom.  {My Mum sleeps on the       
{settee.  It is Â£8 per night.}
