		<title>01GENERAL REVIEW</title>
		<content> Most of our surveyed area consists of 
 fertile farmland,dotted with disused  
 mine shafts and spoil heaps from the  
 abandoned tin mine workings.High      
 Cornish hedges separate the fields and
 the narrow country lanes.In places    
 trees growing in the top of the hedges
 meet over the lanes forming a         
 tunnel.The only other trees,mainly    
 deciduous,are to be found along the   
 banks of the streams.The farming is a 
 mixture of horticultural,including    
 several nurseries,dairy and beef      
 cattle and some sheep.Tourism is a    
 flourishing industry as seen by the   
 purpose built Tolroy Holiday Village  
 and Calloose Caravan Park.In the      
 summer months many farms rent out a   
 field for camping and caravaning and  
 private houses display "Bed &amp;         
 Breakfast" signs.
