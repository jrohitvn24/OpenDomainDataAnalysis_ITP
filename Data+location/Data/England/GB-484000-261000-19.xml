Around the village of Earls Barton,the 
land is cultivated or used for stock.A 
small amount of market gardening is    
carried out with food stuff available  
direct.Lettuce,tomatoes and potatoes   
remain cash crops.                     
Farming on the broader scale consists  
of the production of beef,some sheep   
rearing and considerable proportions of
arable land used for the growing of    
grain.The other crop in evidence in its
season is Oil seed Rape.               
  Of the cereals harvested,wheat       
predominates, though until recent years
barley has been more in evidence.      
  Most of the cereal harvest is used by
local mills;outlets for market garden  
produce exist at Wellingborough,       
Kettering and Northampton markets as   
well as to normal retail outlets.
