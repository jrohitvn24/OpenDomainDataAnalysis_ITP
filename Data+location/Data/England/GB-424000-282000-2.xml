		<title>02Meriden-Village Centre.</title>
		<content> Meriden is the traditional centre of  
 England and located on the village    
 green there remains the base and a    
 portion of{a village cross}which is   
 reputed to mark the exact centre      
 point.                                
                                       
 The cross is now scheduled as an      
 ancient monument, the view is that it 
 was once the market cross and was     
 transferred to its present site. This 
 was possibly done on the orders of a  
 former{Earl of Aylesford}as this      
 family has always had much influence  
 in the affairs of Meriden.            
                                       
 The{Bull's Head Inn}was probably the  
 site of the market place, as it was a 
 coaching inn on the London to Holyhead
 road.
