    PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH PLANNING   
AND HOUSING ARE THE USUAL ISSUES WHICH 
LOCAL COUNCILLORS HAVE TO TACKLE ON    
BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE THEY REPRESENT.   
IN PARTICULAR, NEW HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS
ARE VIEWED WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF    
CONCERN, LEST THEY SPOIL THE QUIET     
ATMOSPHERE OF THE VILLAGE.             
    IN THE PAST, VILLAGERS HAVE        
CAMPAIGNED FOR A 30m.p.h. SPEED LIMIT, 
A CENTRAL WHITE LINE ON THE ROAD TO    
MILDENHALL, AND THE RESHAPING OF A     
DANGEROUS ROAD JUNCTION. ALL HAVE BEEN 
SUCCESSFUL.                            
    MANY LOCAL FARMERS VIEW WITH       
CONCERN DETERIORATING ROAD SURFACES,   
ESPECIALLY IN THE FENS, WHILE IN THE   
VILLAGE ITSELF SOME PEOPLE, NOTABLY THE
ELDERLY, REGRET THE ALMOST COMPLETE    
LACK OF PAVEMENTS BORDERING THE ROADS.
