		<content> Walmer Castle is very interesting. It 
 was built for{Henry VIII}in 1540      
 although he never lived in it. The    
{Duke of Dorset}was made the first Lord
 Warden in 1705 and he made it into a  
 home.{William Pitt}brought the        
 cannons in 1708 but they are only     
 fired in salutation.                  
                                       
 There have been 23 Lord Wardens       
 including{Sir Winston Churchill.      
{HRH The Queen Mother}is the present   
 Lord Warden.                          
                                       
 The area around the castle includes   
 five acres of pleasant gardens.       
                                       
 Walmer Castle gets a few thousand     
 visitors a year. Many of these are    
 foreigners, especially students from  
 France and other European countries.
