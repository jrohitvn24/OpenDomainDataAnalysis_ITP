		<content> A large number of the village         
 inhabitants commute to work, mostly to
 Oxford. Several are employed in the   
 University or other educational       
 spheres. Other places of employment to
 which they commute are, Bicester,     
 Banbury, and a few to London.         
                                       
 Some local people find work on the air
 base. Others are employed in local    
 businesses or on farms in the area.   
                                       
 One of the largest businesses in the  
 village is Heyfordian Coaches which   
 provide school and work buses and also
 run foreign coach tours.
