		<title>13THE METHODIST CHURCH</title>
		<content>    The present Methodist Church was   
 built in 1914 replacing a former      
 Chapel built in 1836. It is said that 
 Charles Wesley visited the village    
 when he was Preaching.                
    The members of the Church hold many
 fund_raising activities and also hold 
 meetings for various groups of people.
 A Sunday School has been in existence 
 for many years and at present it is a 
 very thriving concern. The children   
 are very much inspired by the         
 activities set before them &amp; have put 
 on musical productions which have been
 well supported by the local residents.
 They study the Bible and take exams in
 which they are highly successful.The  
 children also enjoy trips out to visit
 places of interest.                   
    On several occasions the Methodist 
 Church joins St.Giles Church for      
 united services.                      </content>
