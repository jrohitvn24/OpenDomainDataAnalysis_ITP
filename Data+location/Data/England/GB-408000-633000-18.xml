		<content> When Mrs Martin came to Belford School
 there were 7 classes for children aged
 5 to 15, with about 30 pupils in      
 each.She paid 1p to travel in from    
 Mousen on the service bus.Free        
 transport was only for those who lived
 more than 3 miles from school.Many    
 children cycled in.                   
 There was no wall on the corridor;the 
 classrooms opened straight into the   
 fresh air.Boys wore shorts all year   
 and did P.E. in these, while girls    
 wore navy_blue knickers for P.E. and  
 wore white ankle_socks winter and     
 summer.The showers were used by the   
 seniors after games.The children      
 worked silently at their desks all    
 day.Reading was done from the board in
 the first class and even further up   
 the school children were not allowed  
 to take books home.There were no toys 
 or televisions.                       </content>
