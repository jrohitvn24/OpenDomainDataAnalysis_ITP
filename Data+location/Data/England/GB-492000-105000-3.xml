		<content>  The local Cub-Scout group meetings   
 are on Mondays, Wednesdays (6.30 to   
 8.00) and Fridays(7.30 to 9.30).On    
 Monday Cubs meet, they play games, do 
 things to get badges like             
 swimmers,artists and                  
 entertainers.There are also three     
 Arrow awards, bronze, silver and gold.
   Mrs. Botterill is the leader of the 
 Monday pack, the cubs call her Akela. 
 The Wednesday pack is run by Mrs.     
 Standing. Friday is Scout night, they 
 go on lots more camps than the cubs.  
 This is why they have a longer law and
 promise. They have to learn this by   
 heart.It is "On my honour I promise   
 that I will do my best to do my duty  
 to God and to the Queen, help other   
 people and keep the scout law."
