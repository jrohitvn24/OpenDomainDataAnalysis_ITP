		<title>15LEAD MINING</title>
		<content> SHELDON IS SITUATED IN A FORMER LEAD  
 MINING AREA.EVIDENCE IS ALL AROUND IN 
 THE FORM OF DISTURBED GROUND,SPOIL    
 HEAPS,COVERED MINE SHAFTS AND SURFACE 
 REMAINS OF MAGPIE MINE.THIS LATTER IS 
 THE BEST EXAMPLE IN BRITAIN  OF A 19  
 CENTURY LEAD MINE.IT HAS A FASCINATING
 HISTORY INCLUDING FIGHTS AND DISPUTES 
 ENDING IN 3 'MURDERS',THE WIDOWS CURSE
 AND A HISTORY OF REPEATED DISASTERS   
 AND FAILURES THERE AFTER.EARLIEST     
 RECORDS OF THE MINE SHOW IT BEING     
 WORKED ON A SMALL SCALE AROUND 1740   
 BUT ITS HEYDAY WAS THE 19 CENTURY.    
 LIFE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY HARD FOR THE 
 MINERS WHO WOULD HAVE WALKED FROM THE 
 VILLAGE TO THE MINE (THE FOOTPATHS ARE
 STILL HERE)WHILE THE WOMEN LOOKED     
 AFTER THE SMALLHOLDINGS.THE MINE      
 FINALLY CLOSED IN 1953 AND IS NOW     
 PRESERVED BY PEAK PARK AND PEAK       
 DISTRICT MINES HISTORICAL SOCIETY.    </content>
