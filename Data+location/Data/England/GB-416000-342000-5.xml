		<content>   Clifton is a fairly small village   
 around one and a half miles from      
 Ashbourne.It contains all kinds of    
 houses both old and new.              
   Originally the village was only     
 small and mainly based around the     
 church so this area has the oldest    
 houses in it.                         
   Cross Side is a cul de sac which    
 has alot of semi-detatched houses.    
 Clifton Primary School is also along  
 this road.The school was built in 1854
 but it also has a modern terrapin     
 joined on to it.                      
   From Cross Side you turn right      
 towards Cock Hill where the old part  
 of the village is.Here we have the    
 Post Office run by Mr.Wilson who has  
 lived in the village all his life also
 the vicarage where the Reverend       
 Daughtry and his family live.
