		<content> Within the area there is a very strong
 tradition of inter pub darts and      
 dominoes leagues.In the pub where I   
 live every Monday night except bank   
 holiday Monday we have a domino       
 handicap.This is where some of the    
 local people join together and  play  
 dominoes just for fun.Everyone pays   
 25p to enter and whoever wins takes   
 all the money raised.The names are    
 placed in a mug and and every name is 
 pulled out and partnered together.Then
 the first heat is played and the      
 winners of that heat play again and so
 on until you get to the last two      
 people who then play the final.The    
 kitchen provides a pie and pea supper 
 for all the people who enter.They all 
 enjoy themselves very much.I think    
 this is a good form of recreation.
