We went down to the old airfield and   
walked across the fields using the old 
runway roads.We passed a pond called   
the Rookery and walked along side the  
canal.                                 
     We cut across the fields of wheat 
and hay and ended up at a large farm   
house called Sushions Manor.It was     
built in the early 18th century.The    
house was built with bricks and stone. 
It had red and black tiles.On the farm 
they had some cows with their young and
a bull.                                
    When the house was built some monks
lived there.When the monks lived there,
there was a bell.The bell was used to  
call the workers on the farm to stop   
work.At the farm was a duck pond.We saw
some fields of rape,barley and         
potatoes.The farmer said the house had 
been in the family all the time.       </content>
