		<title>18A CHILDS DAY.</title>
		<content>  A typical Saturday.                  
 I get up at 8.00 am and get dressed.  
 Then I go for my morning jog.After    
 that I come home and feed the cat,    
 then I have my breakfast.I have cereal
 bacon and egg.Then I watch tv at 10.00
 am for 1 hour.After that I ride my    
 bike around the farm.At 1.00 pm I have
 my dinner which normally is scrambled 
 egg on toast,and a cup of tea and     
 Instant Whip.Then I go down to the    
 garage for an hour to polish cars  and
 do odd jobs for my dad.I come home and
 we go to Mrs Dines for the papers and 
 our saturday sweets.We then go home   
 and play on the computer,then we have 
 tea.Then my sister Elizebeth and I    
 walk down to our woods to play        
 climbing trees and hide and seek.we   
 wash and put our pyjamas on and watch 
 T.V. with mum and dad and then go to  
 bed.                                  </content>
