       At first the brook went quite   
 slowly.Outside our schools pedestrian 
 gate,the bridge is made of concrete   
 and has wooden sides.Further up the   
 stream ,there is a bridge made of     
 metal and about 3 yards after         
 that,there is a road called Holt Drive
 going over the brook.Further up,past  
 Lodge Farm School, Sandalwood Road    
 goes over brook.The brook starts as a 
 little spring in the Outwoods and then
 flows through Loughborough to the     
 Soar,then the Trent and the Humber    
 then it finishes at the sea.We saw    
 lots of plant life,for                
 instance,outside the school there are 
 Horsechestnut trees,Hawthorn bushes   
 and Lime Trees.And by the brook there 
 are Willow trees and Lilac bushes.We  
 saw Daisies,Buttercups and Sycamore   
 trees.There were 33 new trees planted </content>
