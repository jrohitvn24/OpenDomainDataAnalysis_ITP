		<title>07     ANTLER LUGGAGE</title>
		<content> The{Antler Luggage}factory is situated
 close to Lower Gigg on the East side  
 of{Bury.}The company is housed in a   
 large one-time cotton mill, and has   
 established a world-wide reputation.  
 The mill was empty for some years     
 before it was taken over by{Antler}in 
 the early 1970's. It was used as a    
 warehouse for the C.W.S. but was      
 closed as more and more Co-op shops   
 shut in the Bury area.                
 During the Second World War the       
 factory was used for making munitions.
 In common with many other textile     
 factories in this area it is a good   
 example of a change of use to new     
 consumer based industries.
