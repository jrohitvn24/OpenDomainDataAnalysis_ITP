		<title>10CHESTERTON MILL</title>
		<content> Five miles South_East Leamington Spa  
 on a hill above the Fosseway.Open six 
 arched base built from stone possibly 
 from old Chesterton Manor.The original
 wooden upper storey,replaced by brick 
 in the 19th century,with domed lead   
 roof and sails of the common type.    
 Building erected 1632 for Sir Edward  
 Payto or Son Edward,possibly as an    
 observatory.However a 1649 marriage   
 settlement refers to the building as a
 mill for grinding corn.Many years ago 
 the miller who owned both Chesterton  
 and Harbury mills would set the sails 
 at Harbury then ride to Chesterton to 
 work that mill,at the same time       
 watched for a change in the weather.At
 Chesterton he sails there,then on a   
 fast horse gallop to Harbury in time  
 to adjust the sails there.
