		<title>12Ven House</title>
		<content> As you leave Milborne Port to go to   
 Shaftesbury you will see the fine     
 mansion known as Ven.                 
 The house was built in 1700  by James 
 Medlycott and is one of the finest    
 brick built houses of its time.There  
 is an impressive cedar lined drive    
 and the original orangery is still in 
 use.The interior has had few changes  
 made to it even though it has been    
 used as a family home.                
 For a long time it was the seat of the
 Medlycott family and was sold as      
 recently as the second World War.     
 Since this time it has changed hands  
 several times.For a while it was used 
 as a horticultural center but it is   
 now a private family dwelling.        
 The house is surrounded by landscaped 
 park land and farms.
