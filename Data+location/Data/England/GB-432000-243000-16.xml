 The old buildings in the village are  
 built of Hornton stone with Cotswold  
 roofs. Of particular note are the     
 Manor in Upper Tysoe, the parish      
 church of St. Mary, three thached     
 cottages on the Green, two in the     
 Square, one in Back Lane, and three   
 in Upper Tysoe. Several redundant farm
 barns - in Upper and Lower Tysoe -    
 have been converted into dwellings,   
 thus preserving them from falling into
 decay. In the last 40 years, many     
 new houses have been built - in a     
 mixture of materials and styles -     
 brick, pebbledash, reconstituted      
 stone, and with wooden fascia boards. 
 Purpose built farm buildings, of steel
 and corugated asbestos, have been     
 erected to replace the redundant stone
 barns.
