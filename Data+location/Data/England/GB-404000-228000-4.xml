		<title>04HAILES CHURCH (History)</title>
		<content> The first church at Hailes was        
 probably built in the 12th century by 
 Ralph de Worcester,the main local     
 landowner at that time.When Hailes    
 Abbey was founded in 1246 the church  
 passed into its control.As laymen were
 not allowed to attend the Abbey       
 services,the church continued to be   
 used by the visitors and workmen who  
 were employed there.When the Abbey was
 dissolved in 1539 Hailes Church was   
 allowed to survive and passed into the
 control of the Tracy family.
