 characteristics. They are of many     
 different colours:{grey,black and     
 different shades of{brown.}Many{grey  
 horses are born{bay}as are other      
 coloured horses.They grow to heights  
 of{16}hands but some do not grow over 
{14}hands.The average height is{15}.   
  At{5-6 months}the foals,which are    
 generally born in{February},are       
 separated from the mares.About {10-15}
 foals are born each year and{10 foals 
 are there now.There are{40 horses     
 at the stud but it does vary.

 but it burnt down.It was then turned  
 into a stud and has been modernized.  
 The stud is very clean and well equipp
 -ed with heat lamps and a sand school.
