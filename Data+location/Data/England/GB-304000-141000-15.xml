		<content>      Last Century Lady Wyndham fainted
 at dinner.The people thought she was  
{dead}so she was{buried}in the         
 Church.                               
      The{Verger}came in one night and 
 went to Lady Wyndhams grave.He opened 
 it up and got off her jewellery.He    
 couldn't get her ring so he bagan to  
 chop off her finger.She{woke up}so he 
 ran away.                             
     {Lady Wyndham}picked up the       
 lantern and walked to{Kentsford Farm. 
 The dogs barked,the servants looked   
 out of the door thinking she was a    
 ghost and they screamed. They told Mr.
 Wyndham who went outside and saw his  
 wife. Two weeks later she             
 had a baby.She had nine sons and lived
 longer than her husband.
