		<content> The work pattern of the village has   
 changed a lot in recent years.  Not   
 many years ago, most of the villagers 
 would have been employed on local     
 farms but with the increasing         
 mechanisation of farming, most people 
 have had to find work elsewhere,      
 mainly in the nearby towns of         
 Shrewsbury and Oswestry.              
                                       
 Housing within the village has also   
 changed.  In common with many         
 Shropshire villages, a number of      
 council properties have been built    
 recently.  A small number of private  
 houses have also been added.  It is   
 only about 20 years since the majority
 of houses in the village have been    
 connected to mains sewerage and water.
