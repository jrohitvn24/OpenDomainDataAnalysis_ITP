		<title>17SOUTHERN BURWELL HOUSING.</title>
		<content> In 1985 there were around{330 houses  
{in}the{southern}part of{Burwell.}Most 
 of these are{privately owned.}There   
{are}very few council houses.          
 In{Reach}and{Swaffham Prior}most      
 houses are privately owned though     
 there is{some council housing}around  
 Fairview.                             
 Some people have built their own homes
 because they thought it would be      
 cheaper than to buy one.For instance  
 one couple chose a site because it's  
 by the river with ducks coming on the 
 lawn.They used roughly 24,000 bricks  
 which were Severn Valley weather      
 stock. They had help from a friend and
 from a bricklayer.An architect they   
 knew drew up the plans.               
 Such a{self_built,semi_detached house 
 made between{1980_85}could cost       
{Â£60,000.                              
                                       </content>
