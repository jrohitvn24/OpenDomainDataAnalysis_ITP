		<title>07RUSHALL CHURCH</title>
		<content> Rushall Church Of Christ was built in 
 1887 and is a very small daughter     
 church which was not built to last. It
 is constructed from a metal frame     
 covered with corrugated metal. It has 
 a porch for notices. A bell fell from 
 the roof twenty years ago, missing the
 vicar by inches. The original pews are
 old and worn. The organ, which was    
 bought second hand is not used now    
 because it squeaks. The Victorian font
 is made of stone. Services are Sundays
 and Wednesdays. Baptisms and funerals 
 are held here, but the church does not
 have a licence for weddings. In winter
 the church is very cold and in summer 
 it is very hot.
