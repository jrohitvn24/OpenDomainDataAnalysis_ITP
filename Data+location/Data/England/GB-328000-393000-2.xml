		<title>02GORSEHILL WATER TOWER</title>
		<content> This was built between 1902 and 1905. 
 It is 30 metres high, octagonal in    
 shape, with a large platform on top.  
 You get to the top by a spiral        
 staircase with 130 steps. The tower is
 made of Runcorn stone. The Wallasey   
 News, February 4th. 1905, tells you   
 all about this. It is in Earlston Road
 Library. The water comes from Lake    
 Vyrnwy in Wales, and water from local 
 wells is also used. There is a storge 
 capacity of six million gallons. A    
 middle aged man told us that on the   
 very top of the tower are the main    
 homing beacons for planes coming from 
 America and even Concorde uses them.  
 There is a small amount of wildlife in
 the ground around the tower. Foxes    
 live in the gorse and some sparrow    
 hawks and an owl live in the arches.
