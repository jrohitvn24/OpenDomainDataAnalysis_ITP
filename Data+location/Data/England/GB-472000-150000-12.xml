		<title>12THE GREAT CHALK PIT</title>
		<content> The Chalk Pit is near the A32, Alton, 
 Reading road. It one of the deepest   
 chalk pits in the South of England. It
 is used, mainly as a small-holding,   
 covering about seven and three quarter
 acres of land. It was last used to dig
 chalk, for liming the fields, in 1939,
 when a mechanical digger was used for 
 the first time. The sides of the pit  
 are seventy feet high. A great deal of
 local history is centered around the  
 Great Chalk Pit. In West Street, an   
 office in a private house belongs to  
 the local undertaker. The Red Cross   
 Centre,near the A32 road, is used as a
 hall to entertain elderly poeple.     
 Wheel-chairs and aids for the disabled
 are stored there. The Recreation      
 Ground has a football pitch and swings
 There are two tennis courts, one is   
 privately owned. At The Crown, public 
 house, there is a bus stop.           </content>
