		<content> After lunch we went on our trip and   
 while we were walking I had to look   
 out for the drains but I did two      
 rubbings of the drains and then I had 
 to draw all of the rest and then we   
 went home.

 When we stopped on the seafront Miss  
 Long said stop and sit down.Then she  
 said up there is the Coast Guard      
 House.When we were half way up Tyedean
 Road the rain started so we ran up the
 hill to shelter under the church.Then 
 some drips came down off the roof. So 
 Alex asked Miss Long if he could go   
 and see if his mother was in.Miss Long
 said yes.So he went to see if his     
 mother was in.His mother wasn't in. So
 Sarah asked if she could go and see if
 her mum was in, she was so we         
 sheltered there.
