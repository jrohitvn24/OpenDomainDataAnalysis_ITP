		<content> Some of our class visited the         
 Postmaster at the Exmouth post office.
 We found that: There are 60 post boxes
 in the Exmouth area. Only 1 in the    
 last 23 years has been badly          
 vandalised. The Exmouth post office   
 delivers artificial limbs to the      
 department of health. Some of the     
 strangest things sent are tyres,      
 ironing boards, step ladders and even 
 a bird cage. The biggest change in the
 last few years has been mechanisation.
 The sacks that postmen use, used to be
 made by H.M prisons. Now they are made
 by big manufacturers. The price of the
 British stamp is expected to remain   
 the same until 1986. The normal       
 postage price is 17p(first class) or  
 13p(second class). If posted early, a 
 first class letter reaches its        
 destination the following day. Second 
 class takes 3 days.                   </content>
