		<title>10WITHERS FRUIT FARM</title>
		<content> The 800 acres of this farm lie west   
 of Wellington Heath on south facing   
 slopes at an altitude of 400 feet     
 which{reduces the likelihood of frost.
 The bad winter and spring of 1985 had 
 no adverse effect on the blossom which
 was well serviced by the{resident     
{bees.                                 
 Modern sprays and weedkillers have    
 made very{intensive}growing possible. 
 Inefficient blackcurrant bushes were  
 recently replaced with a new variety  
 of smaller{spindle apple trees}which  
 can be planted at the rate of 300 to  
 400 per acre instead of the usual 100.
 Whilst these mature, crops of         
{strawberries}are grown in between. A  
 new strain called{Totem}which is firm 
 and red all through and therefore more
 suitable for jam, freezing and travel,
 has been introduced. Gooseberries are 
 grown in between young plum trees.    </content>
