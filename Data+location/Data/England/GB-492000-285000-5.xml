		<content> On the 13th June a group of us went to
 the Quarry. 175 m. years ago when this
 was covered in water it was though    
 that there was a whirlpool in this    
 area which left many fossils.  The man
 who took is round said that someone   
 had found a fossil that weighed 70lbs 
 and was valued at Â£400.  Around the   
 quarry were found many caves.  Many   
 fascinating things have been found    
 there such as a blacksmiths works     
 shop, horse stables and a cave where  
 some German weapons were found during 
 the 1939-45 war, neatly packed. (The  
 steel works were built from German    
 designs).  The limestone in this      
 quarry was not suitable for building, 
 but on the other side of the road the 
 stone from the quarry was and is used 
 to build churches and colleges at     
 Cambridge.  In this quarry there was  
 20' of limestone and 15' of ironstone.</content>
