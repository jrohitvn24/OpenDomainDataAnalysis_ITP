 We carried out a survey in Little     
 Neston to find out about Sport and    
 Leisure activities. 71% were fond of  
 sport, and 23% thought that you didn't
 need to partake in sport to keep fit. 
 77% would prefer to go out fo a meal  
 than to go out to a sports evening.   
 Only 17% were members of Neston Rec.  
 Centre. 22% had been to Wimbledon to  
 watch a tennis final. 23% went jogging
 too.                                  
                                       
 Transport                             
 We interviewed people in our area and 
 found that 65% had a car in their     
 family, although only 63% of these    
 people were able to drive. 38% of the 
 drivers had passed their driving test 
 first time. 59% of the cars owned in  
 our survey were British made.         </content>
