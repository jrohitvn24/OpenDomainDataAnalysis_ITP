		<title>01GENERAL VIEW OF THE BLOCK</title>
		<content>  The block although situated on the   
N.W. side of the Potteries could not be
described as a solely industrial area. 
It contains a variety of types of land 
cover,and this is reflected in the     
character of the area.A large part of  
the area is land that is being,or has  
been reclaimed or redeveloped,however  
the area itself has retained much of   
its traditional character.             
                         The Potteries 
is a very insular area,and the N.W.    
corner reflects this.Each area has its 
own identity,and this is also evident  
in the text.                           
         It is predominantly a mixture 
of residential and industrial land,with
a large proportion of open space.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
