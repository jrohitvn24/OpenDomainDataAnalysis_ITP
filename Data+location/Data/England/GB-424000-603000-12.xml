		<title>12THE HERMITAGE AT WARKWORTH</title>
		<content> Half a mile upstream from Warkworth   
 Castle is the{Hermitage,}situated in a
{secluded spot}by the side of the      
 Coquet. It{consists of three rooms    
{hewn out of the solid rock}overhanging
 the river, and is reached by{a flight 
{of steps,}also cut out of stone. The  
{chapel is carved in elegant Gothic    
{design}and contains{the tomb of a lady
 along with{a hermit sculptured on the 
{walls,}kneeling at the foot of the    
 tomb, his head on his right hand. The 
{history of the Hermitage is enveloped 
{in mystery,}but generally it is       
 accepted that the first hermit was    
{Bertram of Bothal,}who mistakenly     
 killed his own brother and Isabel of  
 Widdrington, whom he loved. Both were 
 escaping in disguise from a Scottish  
 castle.{Today the Hermitage can be    
{reached by boat from the opposite bank
{of the river Coquet.                  </content>
