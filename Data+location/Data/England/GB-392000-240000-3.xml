		<title>03My Village Birlingham</title>
		<content> Birlingham is a quiet place. There are
 fields with cabbages, potatoes,       
 cauliflower and wheat. There are about
 two hundred and fifty people living in
 Birlingham. There is a cricket pitch .
 The pub is called The Swan. In the    
 village there are four farms. Visitors
 come to the village to fish in the    
 river , mostly they go on barges and  
 pleasure cruisers. Sometimes people   
 come walking around the village to see
 what's in the fields and to look at   
 the hill. There's a lock and a weir at
 Nafford. I like living in the village 
 because there's plenty of stuff to do.
 I like going to Neil Griffin's farm. I
 milk the cows with Neil and I feed the
 cows.
