		<title>04KEMPSEY'S PARISH HALL.</title>
		<content>      The pre_war parish hall is about 
 a mile from the actual church. It was 
 built at the start of the twentieth   
 century and since then has become a   
 centre of village life. Groups that   
 are held there are:{Cornflower club,  
{Playgroup,Women's Institute }and even 
 Bingo!                                
{   }As well as providing a meeting    
 place for groups or receptions the    
 parish hall is also the place where   
 all the local 'gossip' is exchanged.  
     The structure is part brick, part 
 wood and also part metal.It comprises 
 of a stage,a hall,a kitchen where     
 light refreshments can be made and of 
 course a toilet.                      
    In recent years clubs such as the  
 Brownies and the Cubs have left the   
 parish hall in favour of a new base in
 the old primary school which has been 
 transformed into a second parish hall.</content>
