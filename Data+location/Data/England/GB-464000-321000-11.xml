		<content> The church of St.John the Baptist is  
 in Church Lane.It was burnt down in   
 the 1830's and re-built in 1835 at a  
 cost of Â£5,000.The first church was   
 made of wood but the new one is made  
 of stone.The Victorian vicarage is now
 up for sale and a new vicarage is to  
 be built on the Glebe Field.Our last  
 vicar left in March 1985 and at the   
 moment the parish has not got a vicar.
 The church tower has a fine clock     
 which shows different times on each   
 face.There are 4 bells in the tower   
 which are rung by the Old Dalby and   
 Nether Broughton ringers.The largest  
 bell is the tenor which was cast in   
 1608 and weighs 9 tons.Four of the    
 ringers are from our primary school.  
 The choir has 9 members and practises 
 every Friday evening.The girl         
 choristers wear blue and the boys red 
 and white gowns.                      </content>
