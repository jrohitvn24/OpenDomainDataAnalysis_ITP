		<content> year,  just before her l0lst birthday 
                                       
 she died.On the fountain there is a   
 plaque to commemorate her centenary.  
 Set back from the war memorial is     
 the village hall. Many clubs meet here
 from Brownies to the Over sixties. The
 floor has a badminton court painted on
 it. You can hire the village hall for 
 parties and dances and also for       
 coffee   mornings and jumble sales.   
   Once upon a time there were fourteen
 pubs but now there are only four.     
 The reason for the decrease is that   
 river traffic declined and because    
 there no more bargemen the pub        
 trade was not required. Now we have   
 three grocers'shops, a butcher and    
 a post office store. You can buy      
 newspapers from one of the            
 garages. The fish and chip shop is    
 open three nights a week.             </content>
