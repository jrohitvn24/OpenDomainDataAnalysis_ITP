		<title>04LONGFIELD CENTRE-PRESTWICH</title>
		<content> A whole network of small cobbled      
 streets was demolished to make way for
 the Longfield Shopping Centre. In a   
 recent survey it was obvious that it  
 attracted people from outside the     
 immediate area, and that the "village"
 is no longer such.                    
 The people interviewed came mainly to 
 shop and did so several times a week. 
 They enjoyed living in Prestwich      
 because of the friendliness of the    
 people, the pleasant surroundings and 
 the convenience in travelling to      
 Manchester and Bury.                  
 A leisure centre and swimming pool    
 were the amenities they would most    
 like to see in the Longfield area.The 
 many changes were thought to be good.
