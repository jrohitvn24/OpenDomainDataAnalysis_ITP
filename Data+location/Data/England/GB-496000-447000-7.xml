		<title>07St Marys Church Lockington</title>
		<content>  St Marys Church used to be a lot     
 smaller.It was built in 1140 by the   
 Normans.The actual existing parts     
 that the Normans built are the arched 
 door the string course and the arch   
 which used to go right up.The church  
 is made out of sandstone and brick.   
 The reason as to why it has brick as  
 well as stone is because stone wasn't 
 found near Lockington and also it was 
 very expensive.Some of the windows in 
 the church are Tudor,they are flat    
 topped and were built in the 16th     
 century.Also in the 16th century the  
 Tudors decided to extend the church.  
 The Gothic windows are in the south   
 wall at the east of the church,they   
 were built in 1350.At the west side of
 the church there used to be a door.The
 church used to have a flat roof but   
 now the east end of the church has a  
 pointed roof.                         </content>
