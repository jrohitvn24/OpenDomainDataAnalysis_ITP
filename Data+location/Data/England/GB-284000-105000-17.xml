		<content> A high level of social concern is     
 displayed by commitment to{political  
{parties}and{voluntary organisations}, 
 to formal voluntary service like Meals
 on Wheels and Hospital Car Service and
 to much informal neighbourly help. A  
 telephone network links the able      
 bodied, for calling out to{emergencies
 such as fire, flood, snow or accident.
 The parish bought a ladder for use by 
 this group. Fine Elizabethan          
 almshouses have been sold and the     
 proceeds invested for charitable      
 purposes. They have been superceded by
 a grant of a{Council sheltered        
{bungalows, with phone}lines to a      
 Warden. Before 1965 a{policeman}lived 
 in the police house which is now      
 privately owned.{Police officers}from 
 Crediton are on call and also patrol  
 in cars.
