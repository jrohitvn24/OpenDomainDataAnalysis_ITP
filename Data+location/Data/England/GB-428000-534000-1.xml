   There are 14 working farms in the D-
 Block.One is mainly concerned with    
 Garden Produce such as vegetables and 
 soft fruits.The rest are all mixed    
 farms.                                
   Many farms around Hett and Tursdale 
 were owned by the Coal Board but now  
 most of them have been bought from    
 them.                                 
 Most of the mixed farms have cattle   
 rather than sheep,and many now are    
 growing Oil Seed Rape rather than     
 corn crops.
