		<content> The area is mainly residential.  The  
 type of housing is mixed.  Part of the
 area is council housing built in the  
 1930's to take overspill population   
 from the inner City redevlopment.  The
 houses are a mixture of semi-detached,
 detached and terraced blocks.  All are
 made of red brick with tiled roofs and
 small porches.  None have garages.    
 They are built in tree-lined crescents
 with many cul-de-sacs.                
 There are large detached and          
 semi-detached homes of indvidual      
 styles and sizes.  There are Victorian
 terraces and villa-type houses, (two  
 or three storeys) with small front    
 gardens or none at all and narrow back
 gardens.  The Lyndhurst Estate        
 contains houses built in the 1950's   
 with separate blocks of garages.      
 There are also 12-storey blocks of    
 flats which have been reinforced.     </content>
