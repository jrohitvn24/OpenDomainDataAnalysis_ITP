		<title>13CHARLTON BUS GARAGE</title>
		<content>The Charlton bus service is very       
important because some people don't    
have cars and they need to get to work 
or get their shopping,also some of the 
children use it to get to              
school.Charlton services started in    
1920 when Mr Knight owned it.It was    
first used to carry parcels,people     
gave the bus driver their shopping list
and he went into Oxford and bought     
their shopping for them.The present    
owner has owned it since 1955.There    
were 5 buses then,now there are 14.The 
Bus Garage was built in 1942.It is     
used to paint and repair the buses.    
One old Charlton bus has been turned   
into a restaurant and the Marston      
Scouts use another old bus.It costs    
quite a lot to keep a bus,each bus uses
14000l of diesel a month,tyres and     
engines are very expensive.The buses   
are cleaned everyday.                  </content>
