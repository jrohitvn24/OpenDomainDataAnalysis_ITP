		<title>10ARLINGTON MILL,BIBURY</title>
		<content> In the 17th century the mill was a    
 cloth mill and up to 1914 the local   
 farmers woulld still bring their corn 
 to be ground into flour. Later it was 
 restored and made into a folk museum  
 and art gallery. There are many old   
 clothes, house_hold goods and farm    
 machinery, stuffed wild life, old     
 dolls, toys and paintings.            
 In 1985 new curators are extending the
 scope of the museum with week-end     
 demonstrations of country crafts like 
 spinning, potterey and making corn    
 dollies. During the summer evenings   
 there are lectures on country and     
 local topics with the occasional      
 poetry reading.                       
 The museum is open to visitors every  
 day during the summer and at week-ends
 in the winter.
