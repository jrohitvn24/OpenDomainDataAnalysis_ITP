		<content> To find out about {housing}in our area
 we went out of school in groups to    
 draw a plan of the area. We went down 
 each road and drew all of the houses  
 onto paper, marking down the number   
 and types of houses.                  
 The first thing we found was that     
 there were really four types of houses
 in the area -                         
       1. pre/post war 1920-1950       
       2. chalet style 1960's          
       3. palin fronted1960's          
       4. bungalows ranging from old   
          to new.                      
  Most of the pre and post war houses  
 were nearest to the Hinckley Road and 
 around Ravenhurs School. The newer    
 houses were built around Millfield and
 Stafford Leys schools, and were built 
 when new jobs were created in         
 Leicester.
