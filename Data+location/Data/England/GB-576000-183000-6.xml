		<title>06Canvey - The Lake (1)</title>
		<content>    Once set in a rural area with only 
 a few scattered weather-boarded       
 cottages nearby or overlooking, the   
 lake is now surrounded by high density
 urban housing estates built in the    
 last 15 years. It is also a part of   
 the sea-defences being a storm drain  
 as {Hilton Dyke} runs into it from the
 North bank. There are pumping stations
 at either end. A pathway along the    
 banks are heavily used since then the 
 lake has been subjuct to disastrous   
 ecological changes due to extra silt  
 being deposited, the overgrowth of    
 reeds leading to stagnant water,      
 extensive rubbish dumping from people 
 and excrement from domestic pets.     
   The area has been the subject of    
 much local concern when it was        
 realised that the state of            
 deterioration could not be allowed to 
 continue.                             </content>
