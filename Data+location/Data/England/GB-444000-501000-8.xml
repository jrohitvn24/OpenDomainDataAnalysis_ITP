		<content> These villages enjoy a strong bracing 
 climate out of range of Teesside's    
 industrial pollution. They are served 
 by{a doctor}from Hutton Rudby who     
 holds surgery at Swainby twice weekly 
 and delivers presciptions, and by     
{group-practice doctors}from Stokesley 
 Health Centre. The nearest{hospital}  
 and ambulance service is at North-    
 allerton. Health-service{nurses}make  
 daily visits and do weekly bathing. A 
{Social Worker}arranges Home Helps     
 (Swainby has 4) and nursing aids for  
 the{senior citizens,}whose bungalows  
 are connected to a warden by intercom.
 They can have Meals on Wheels, home   
 chiropody and hairdressing. Several   
 attend a Day Centre at Hutton Rudby or
 the Friarage Hospital. Both villages  
 are caring communities and neighbours 
 give help in times of sickness or when
 visiting is needed.                   </content>
