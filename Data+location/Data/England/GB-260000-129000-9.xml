		<content>   Although not a large village        
 Swimbridge still has a public         
 house,the Jack Russell ( named after  
 the former vicar and formally         
 known as the new inn ), post office,  
 butchers shop and a general store. In 
 the past there were 5 shops (including
  antique shops) and three pubs.       
   The present shopping centre is the  
 'Square' in the middle of the         
 settlement on which a group of houses 
 once stood.                           
   The largest shop is{Boxalls General 
{Stores}which sells almost everything  
 from frozen food to firelighters and  
 newspapers to nails. This shop has    
 been in existence for many years. A   
 year or two ago a van coming down     
 Station Hill went out of control and  
 smashed straight into Boxhalls causing
 much of the shop front to be renewed.
