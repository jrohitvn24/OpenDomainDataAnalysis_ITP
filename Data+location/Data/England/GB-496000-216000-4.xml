Dagnall village would now be regarded  
as a commuter village, but before the  
new houses were built there were some  
interesting existing buildings which   
have now disappeared.The pound bank was
a row of houses in a horseshoe shape.  
There were three shops in the village. 
Two of these were turned into houses   
and the third was turned into the      
Golden Rule public house.The new       
general store was built eight years    
ago.There was a bakery and wheelwrights
shop and a brewery.Local legend has it 
that the brewer threw pieces of meat   
into the beer to give it more flavour. 
There were kennels in Deans Meadow     
before all the modern development and a
tramp ward for tramps to sleep in      
overnight before continuing their      
travels.
