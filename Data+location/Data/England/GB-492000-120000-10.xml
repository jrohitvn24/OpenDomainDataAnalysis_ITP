		<content>                                       
{Woolgars}was built in the sixteenth   
 century.It was probably the home of a{
{yeoman   farmer}  called   {Woolgar.} 
 Originally the cottage would have had 
 a{smoke bay}but a brick chimney with  
 a bread oven was built in the         
 seventeenth century. Also at this     
 time an{outhouse}containing the       
 stairs was built on to provide easier 
 access to the upper two rooms.These   
 stairs replaced a{ladder}leading up to
 a hole in the ceiling.During the  late
 twentieth century the lean_to rooms   
 on either end of the cottage were     
 knocked down and new extensions were  
 built on.   My parents kindly allowed 
 some of my friends to visit the house.
 We made a film and showed the rest of 
 my class the unusual parts of         
 the house.   Written and typed by
