		<title>02A Walk to the Day Mark.</title>
		<content> A group of us set out from Dartmouth  
 to walk to the Day Mark,which is a    
 navigational beacon,built high on the 
 hills,overlooking the mouth of the    
 Dart.The hot sun was beating down on  
 us as we started walking.We followed  
 the Coastal Footpath to Mill Bay Cove 
 where we did some sketching and looked
 at Castle boathouse.We went on,the sun
 still beating down on us.Herring gulls
 flew overhead,screeching and looking  
 for food.At Inner Froward Point,we    
 climbed up a path inland towards the  
 Day Mark.It is a very tall stone      
 structure,built in 1840,standing in a 
 field of barley.We went over a stile  
 and along a path until we were right  
 underneath it.It stands on 8 strong   
 legs and feels dark and mysterious    
 inside.When we had made some sketches,
 and enjoyed a cool drink,we started   
 our journey back to Dartmouth.        </content>
