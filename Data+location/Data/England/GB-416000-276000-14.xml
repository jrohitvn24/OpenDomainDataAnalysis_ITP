		<content>  One hour in the live of Sarah Barron 
                                       
      On Monday morning I felt awful, I
 was going to the Dentist. I got ready 
 to go at 9.30 and I ate My Breakfast  
 and cleaned my teeth for 16 minutes.  
 I was really scrubbing my teeth. At   
 10.00 we started off more nervous than
 ever, we entered the waiting room, "Mr
 Backer, please". The horrifying noise 
 of the drill made me feel worse."Sarah
 Barron, please". I walked out of the  
 waiting room and sat in the           
 chair."Hello", said the               
 Dentist,"Hello", I said."B4 A6 D3 B2" 
 What a jumble of numbers! "I'm afraid 
 you'll have to have a filling.". So he
 gave me an injection and filled in my 
 tooth and I went home and my tooth    
 felt weird. When I got to school my   
 friends were having an English lesson.
