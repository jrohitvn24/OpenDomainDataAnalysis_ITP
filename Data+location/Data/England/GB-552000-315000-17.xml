		<title>17WALPOLE CHASE DEVELOPMENT.</title>
		<content> Beginning in spring 1985 D.&amp;H.Builders
 of Long Sutton began the first phase  
 of building on land which connects    
 Walpole St. Peter and Walpole St.     
 Andrew.They plan to build 80 dwellings
 which will take eight years to        
 complete.These dwellings are to be 2,3
 and 4 bedroomed bungalows and houses. 
 In July 1985 they were laying the     
 sewage pipe,digging out the road and  
 laying the first two bases.Linked to  
 this development is the planned new   
 COMMUNITY CENTRE which will become the
 heart of the new Walpole.There is some
 Â£40,000 already in the bank and fund  
 raising events will continue over the 
 next few years.
