		<content>    Public transport is almost non-    
 existent in this area. A private firm 
 runs a bus srvice once a week, which  
 passes through{Bleasby Moor, West and 
{East Torrington,}on its way to        
 Lincoln. It reaches Lincoln at 10.45am
 and leaves for the return journey at  
 2.15pm.{East and West Torrington}     
 belong to the Barkwith Group of       
 Parishes. The parish mini-bus is used 
 to collect worshippers and choir on   
 Sundays, and it collects the Over-60s 
 for their monthly meetings.School     
 buses collect primary-school aged     
 children to take them to Legsby       
 School, and secondary-school aged     
 children to take them to De Aston     
 School,Market Rasen. Apart from these,
 people must rely on private cars,     
 including the volunteer Social Car    
 Service,which will transport people   
 for hospital appointments.            </content>
