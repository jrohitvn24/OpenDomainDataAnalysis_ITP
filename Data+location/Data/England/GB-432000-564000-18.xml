		<title>18THE INCINERATOR</title>
		<content> Within our area lies the local        
 authority incineration station. This  
 was built to provide a cheap and      
 efficient method of getting rid of the
 refuse from the area, and recycling   
 any metal products.                   
 Each week about 2,000 tons of rubbish 
 are taken to the incinerator.After    
 processsing lorries take the resulting
 ash to a nearby tip. This tip will    
 soon be full and it will be landscaped
 to improve the environment.However    
 this wil leave the authority with the 
 problem of what to do with the result 
 of the incinerating process.          
 The fumes which are produced from     
 burning the rubbish are passed through
 a precipitator which cleans them. The 
 cleaned fumes are then sucked out by  
 fans, and dispersed by a chimney.
