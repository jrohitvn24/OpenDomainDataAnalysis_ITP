		<title>12THE OLD MILL</title>
		<content> We visited the old mill. It is at     
 Streetly End. It stands about 40 feet 
 high. There are no sails, and the cap 
 has collapsed. Some of us thought it  
 felt spooky. Here is a poem about it. 
                                       
        The mill ghost.                
 I walked down the path to the disinte_
 grating hunk of wood and brick that   
 was once a mill.                      
 My mind racing I grabbed the handrail 
 and ran up the stairs.                
 Lonely, quiet.... I shivered as the   
 smell of rotting wood wafted around.  
 I fell asleep, only to be woken by a  
 shuffling.                            
 As it came closer I realized it was a 
 ghost!                                
 I ran across the unstable bridge,     
 climbed onto the iron, and fell.      
  The wall closed in on me             
 unconcious...                         </content>
