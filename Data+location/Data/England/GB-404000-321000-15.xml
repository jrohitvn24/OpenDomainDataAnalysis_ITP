		<title>15Customs of Blithfield</title>
		<content> Blithfield Hall has a strong          
 connection with Abbots Bromley        
 village.  Once a year, in September,  
 men from th village carry reindeer    
 horns on their shoulders and perform  
 the Horn Dance in Aots Bromley and    
 surounding district.  They have always
 stopped at the Hall to dance and      
 receive refreshment at lunchtime.  The
 custom is thought to date from        
 pre-christian times.  The goats head  
 is the Bagot faimly crest and was     
 first used by Sir John Bagot.         
 According to family tradition goats   
 were presented by King Richard 11 in  
 appreciation of good hunting in Bagot 
 Park. The goats ae of the Scharzhals  
 or black neck breed and were probably 
 brrought to England by the Crusaders. 
 Until recently the goats could be seen
 in the park. they are now in a rare   
 breeds farm in Devon.                 </content>
