		<content>      Although  the  Northolt  {Airbase
 dominates much of  the  area, the main
 modes of transport used are road, rail
 (and foot!).                          
  The {A40 / Western Avenue}crosses the
 survey area from  west  to east. Local
 traffic can join it  at  one  point in
 the study area: the junction with West
 End Road in  the  easternmost "middle"
 square.  Most  of  the other roads are
 smaller local ones  that  lead  to the
 different areas of housing.           
  There are three stations in the area.
 Ickenham, Ruislip  Gardens  and  South
 Ruislip  are  stations  on  the{London
{Underground}(although these tracks are
 out in the open air). They  are all on
 the{Metropolitan}and{Piccadilly}lines.
 They take workers into  central London
 every morning during the{"rush hour". 
  South Ruislip is also  a{British Rail
 station.                              </content>
