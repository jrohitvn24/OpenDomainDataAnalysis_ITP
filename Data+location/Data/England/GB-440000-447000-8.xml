		<title>08SHOPPING TRENDS IN WETHERBY</title>
		<content>  Being a market town, Wetherby can    
 offer a wide range of shopping        
 amenities, including an open market   
 once a week, two supermarkets, and    
 various other shops, ranging from     
 agricultural suppliers to linen shops.
 Overall, Wetherby can cater for the   
 majority of shopper's weekly needs.   
 More specialised items such as        
 furniture can be obtained from nearby 
 larger shopping centres such as Leeds,
 York and Harrogate.                   
  Since the opening of the Horsefair   
 Centre in 1978, Wetherby's shopping   
 area has become centralised around    
 this pedestrian precinct near the town
 centre. The precinct contains a large 
 supermarket and other smaller shops.  
 There is an abundance of estate agents
 and building societies around the     
 market place. Basically, Wetherby is a
 small town serving a wide rural area. </content>
