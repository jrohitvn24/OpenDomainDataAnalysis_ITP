		<content> The bulk of the population of this    
 block reside in 4 hamlets/villages but
 with scattered housing and farms      
 throughout.                           
                                       
 The houses range from old to fairly   
 modern.                               
                                       
 Most are red brick though some are    
 timber framed. White is a popular     
 colour. No thatched houses were found 
 and no flat roofed ones, rather all   
 were gabled. Most have tiles on their 
 rooves but some have slate.           
                                       
 36% were semi-detached                
 0% were terraced                      
 57% were 2 storeyed                   
 7% were cottages                      
 36% were bungalows                    
 0% were tower blocks                  
 0% were mobile homes                  </content>
