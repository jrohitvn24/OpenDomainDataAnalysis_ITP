		<content> My name is Jo and I belong to the     
 junior conservation group called      
 Watch.  This group started with a     
 small number of people and is getting 
 larger and larger.  We meet every     
 other Saturday.  Every mmbe ets a     
 watch program listing the events for  
 Spring/Summer then again for          
 Autumn/Winter.  Some of the activities
 we have covered ar toad counts, newt  
 counts, and bat counts.  Wildlife     
 garden work, a fungus faray and a     
 water bird survey.  it was noticed    
 that, because of the cold wet summer, 
 the swallows started to leave earlier 
 than usual.  We all feel it is        
 important to understand what is going 
 on around us, and try to preserve it  
 for the future.
