		<title>11Population London Overspill.</title>
		<content>During the 1960's and 70's some        
families from London were encouraged to
leave the capital and start a new life 
in purpose-built housing estates in    
various Suffolk towns.Many families    
were leaving poor,overcrowded housing  
conditions.The Greater London Council  
helped pay for the extra housing,health
and education facilities needed. At the
same time,new industry was encouraged  
to move into the area to provide       
employment.Some of the Suffolk towns   
receiving the Londoners were Brandon,  
Haverhill,Bury St. Edmunds and Sudbury.
The newcomers had an important effect  
on the population figures of the towns 
they had come to.For example,the       
population of the Sudbury/Gt. Cornard  
area rose by about one quater in twenty
years,and East Anglia had the fastest  
growing population in the country at   
the time.                              </content>
