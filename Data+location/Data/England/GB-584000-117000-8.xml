		<title>08HISTORIC CHURCHES</title>
		<content> Except for a few incorporated stones, 
 nothing remains of the Saxon          
 Churchyard mentioned in the first     
 Domesday Book, as contained within the
 hill_top moated manor of Udimore.     
 There is some evidence that the       
 Normans rebuilt in a cruciform        
 patternand that the three piers       
 embedded on the south wall originally 
 led into a south transept, since      
 demolished. With the popularity of the
 manor in Edward 1's time there was    
 greater prosperity and the whole      
 church was extended to almost double  
 its length with a long chancel. .The  
 church was virtually rebuilt 1220 _   
 1260 in the Early English style, as it
 remains today.  At the end of the 19th
 /century single lancet windows were   
 pierced through the north nave wall as
 part of an extensive restoration.
