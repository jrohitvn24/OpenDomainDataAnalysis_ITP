		<title>02Bramhope: Principle Features</title>
		<content> The main feature of Bramhope is the   
 noisy and busy{A660 Leeds - Otley road
 which cuts the village in half.       
 Bramhope has expanded rapidly from a  
 small agricultural village surrounded 
 by farms, to an expensive commuter    
 village for Leeds, with easy access to
 both city and countryside.            
 Underneath the village runs{The Leeds 
{- Harrogate railway line}through the  
 2.25 mile long{Bramhope tunnel.       
 Visible in the village are numerous   
 large air shafts.{Golden Acre Park}is 
 a country park with interesting fauna 
 &amp; flora and a nearby nature reserve.  
 There are two hotels in Bramhope: The 
 Post House and The Parkway, catering  
 primarily for businessmen             
 Two churches serve the community: St. 
 Giles C. of E. and the Methodist      
 Chapel. There is also a{Puritan Chapel
 - one of only two in England.         </content>
