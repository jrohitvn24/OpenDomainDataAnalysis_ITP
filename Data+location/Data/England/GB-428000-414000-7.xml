		<title>07Chapelthorpe Hall</title>
		<content>  Chapelthorpe Hall, built in the      
 seventeenth century was first owned   
 and occupied by the Worrall family. It
 passed from the Worrall family to the 
 Beaumont family. The hall is a stone  
 building which used to have mullioned 
 windows but these were later replaced 
 by sash windows.                      
  It passed to the Charlesworth family 
 in 1814. In 1847 major alterations to 
 the hall were made by removing the    
 three gables and adding  porch to the 
 main entrance. In 1903 parts of the   
 hall were demolished. These included  
 the pantry, butler's room, larder,    
 plate safe, kitchen, scullery,        
 servant's hall and the billiard room. 
  In 1903 the hall passed from the     
 Charlesworth family to the Walker     
 family.                               
  The present owner is Mrs.T.F.Manby.
