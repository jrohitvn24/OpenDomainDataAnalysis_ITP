		<content> Before Colonel Tingey retired,he was a
{teacher}at Millfield Junior School,   
 Edgarley Hall.He taught geography and 
 history,and also enjoyed his work.    
   He is a very strong conservative and
 his views are very much in favour of  
 private{education.}Both of his        
 daughters were privately educated and 
 he quoted:"If you want a bit more then
 you've got to pay for it"             
   In his spare time he{participates}in
 Sealed Knot activities.This is basic- 
 ally the re-enactment of battles which
 took place during the Civil War.Last  
 week the Sealed Knot re-enacted the   
 Battle of Sedgemoor.                  
   The most noticable{changes}he has   
 seen in Greinton are the disappearance
 of farm labourers in Greinton's 23    
 houses.
