		<title>20Tuesday - by a 10 year old</title>
		<content>   I get up at 8.30, dress and have    
 breakfast, brush my hair,put my coat  
 on, get my bag and go to school at 9. 
 A teacher takes us from the playground
 across the road to school. In assembly
 all the Juniors play recorders. A     
 teacher leads prayers. We work in     
 class until 10.40, we play until 11,  
 and work until 12, which is dinner    
 time. We all wash our hands and the   
 teacher checks them. After dinner we  
 go out to play again. From 1.15 we    
 have 10 minutes reading, and work     
 until 2.45. We play until 3, work     
 until 3.15, and have a story or do    
 miming until 3.45, time to go home.   
 I am in the third year juniors. After 
 school I go to my friend's house and  
 her mother takes to Brownies at 6. We 
 come back at 7.15pm. I watch some     
 television, and go to bed at          
 approximately 10pm. Lindsey Lumbard.  </content>
