		<title>20Village Events in Bramdean</title>
		<content> There is an annual church fete and    
 other church fundraising events.  The 
 fete is held in a village garden.  The
 harvest supper is held every Autumn in
 the village hall, and there is always 
 an entertainment to follow the meal.  
 Each summer at least 2 gardens are    
 opened to the public.  There is an    
 annual gymkhana.  Other community     
 entertainments, such as barbecues and 
 carol services, are held at the       
 village hall.  The various clubs which
 meet at the village hall run their own
 functions.  In 1985 much interest was 
 aroused in the Domesday Project, with 
 information on the village being      
 collected by the Bramdean and Hinton  
 Ampner Women's Institute and the local
 Venture Scout's.
