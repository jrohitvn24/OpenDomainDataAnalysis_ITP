		<content>  At the beginning of the 1984-85      
 school year, Wetherby High School had 
 1163 pupils and 76 members of staff,  
 giving a pupil/teacher ratio of 15.4. 
  The first three years are an         
 introduction to the 23 subjects       
 offered, from which pupils choose 8 to
 study in the 4th and 5th years to     
 either GCE Ordinary level, 16+ or CSE 
 standard, depending upon their        
 ability. From 1986, however, these    
 will be replaced by one GCSE course in
 each subject.                         
  The 6th form currently offers over 20
 subjects, at GCE Advanced level, from 
 which pupils normally choose 3. Other 
 courses are available, including pre- 
 vocational BTEC, City and Guilds      
 Foundation and life, social skills and
 community involvement courses. In the 
 future, "A"level students will also   
 have to study two "AS" subjects.      </content>
