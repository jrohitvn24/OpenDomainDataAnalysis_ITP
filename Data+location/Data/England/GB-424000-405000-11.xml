		<title>11RONS CLIFF DIKE AREA.</title>
		<content> On New Road there are 4 sycamore      
 trees, 3 ash and 2 wild roses. Thereis
 a footpath which leads around Mill    
 Farm to Rons Cliff Dike. In the dike  
 we caught a fish which was a running  
 water fish. It was about 6 cm. long,  
 slim with a flattened head, hence the 
 name 'Bullhead', we later discovered  
 that it was known locally as the      
 'Miller's Thumb',( we later released  
 it again).                            
  We carried on along the footpath     
 along the dike and noticed a lot of   
 rough grazing. We then walked through 
 a barley field and met a farmer. We   
 asked him some questions. He rents 92 
 hectares of land from the Cannon Hall 
 Estate. He said most of the fields    
 were grass, rough grazing and barley. 
 His name was Mr.Fletcher and he had   
 200 cattle, half dairy, half beef. His
 house was built in 1655.              </content>
