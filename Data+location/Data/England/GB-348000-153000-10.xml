		<title>10CAVES ON MENDIP</title>
		<content>    The Carboniferous limestone        
 underlying this block is chemically   
 weathered by rain water-a weak        
 acid-which penetrates the rock through
 its joints &amp; bedding planes. Entering 
 at swallets, the water eventually     
 forms underground passages &amp; caverns. 
 The caves in this block can be        
 extensive-Longwood Swallet is about   
 1500m long. Rhino Rift is nearly 170m 
 deep. Many contain stalactites,       
 stalagmites and other spectacular     
 features, though some have been       
 destroyed by carelessness over the    
 years.                                
    Water entering cave systems in this
 block have been traced by dyes to     
 Cheddar Rising and Wookey Hole. Below 
 the water table the speed of flow is  
 very slow indeed as the gaps are much 
 smaller.
