		<title>15Wildlife around Cattistock</title>
		<content> Because of the great variety of       
 habitat a wide range of animals live  
 in and around Cattistock.             
 The hedgerows in the area contain most
 of the British species of small       
 mammals:  stoats, weasels, rabbits and
 a large number of hedgehogs, besides  
 countless rodents of all kinds.  Both 
 grass and smooth snakes are often     
 seen.  There are four known badger    
 setts in the woodlands, as well as    
 many foxes, grey squirrels and several
 roe deer.                             
 The River Frome, which contains trout 
 and several other species of fish,    
 supports coot, moorhen and visiting   
 herons.  A colony of swifts returns to
 the village each summer, along with   
 large numbers of swallows and house   
 martins.  There are several rookeries 
 and buzzards nesting every year, also 
 three types of owl.                   </content>
