		<title>16People using the scrap yard</title>
		<content>  We interviewed some of the people who
 go to the yard.They all stated that   
 they use the yard for odd pieces of   
 cars which they would find more       
 expensive to buy brand new.           
  Most of those people interviewed buy 
 small things,items like door handles  
 from the 200 to 400 cars that are on  
 the premises.                         
   We were told the yard makes the most
 sales on tyres,which are cheaper than 
 new tyres.The manager said that people
 buying them come in for two or four   
 much more often than the odd one.     
  The manager stated that the yard is  
 at its busiest at weekends,when they  
 may get up to 500 or 600 customers.
