		<title>06TRANSPORT IN BASSINGBOURN</title>
		<content> Between 8am and 2pm on Friday 11th    
 July, some children did a transport   
 survey. We recorded the information on
 a tally chart. It was split up into   
 nine categories.                      
{Car Van Lorry M/bike Bike Bus Farm    
 419  80  23    19    102   17  5      
{Community  Wheelchair                 
   11          1      {Total:}713      
  Most cars were spotted during        
 8.00-9.00, because it is parents going
 to work and bringing their children to
 school. It is the same with the cycles
 because some children use their bikes 
 to come to school. The lorries are    
 consistent because of deliveries to   
 different places at different times.  
 Community service vehicles include    
 Police cars, Ambulance, Fire engines  
 and Taxis. Even though we have a good 
 farming area we saw only 5 vehicles.
