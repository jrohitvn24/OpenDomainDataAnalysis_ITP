 and is a private estate built in the  
 late 60s.  There are both detached and
 terraced houses. Many of the detached 
 have been extended or have had double 
 glazing fitted.  Three closes,        
 Canterbury, Ely and York, lead off    
 Lincoln Park. There are two greens,   
 both used as unofficial playing areas.
 It is within easy walking distance of 
 schools and of the town centre.

 semi-detached, with one row of        
 terraced houses. Although most were   
 built in the 30s, some are modern.    
 Some have mock-Tudor timbering and    
 most have porches and metal-framed    
 windows. Some have extensions and new 
 roofs.Brudenell Girls' Secondary      
 School and St. George's First School

 cemetery next to a private beechwood. </content>
