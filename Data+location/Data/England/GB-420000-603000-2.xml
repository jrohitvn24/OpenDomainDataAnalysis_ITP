		<title>02Cup and Ring Marks,Morwick.</title>
		<content> Cup and ring carvings on rocks are    
 found in many places in North         
 Northumberland.They date from almost  
 1600BC.Several carvings can be seen on
 the sandstone cliffs alongside the    
 River Coquet at Morwick.The carvings  
 take the form of spirals,sometimes    
 linked together,and cup and ring      
 designs.The carved symbols appear to  
 have a religious origin and were      
 probably associated with burial       
 customs because they are usually near 
 burial sites.                         
 The site at Morwick is difficult to   
 reach and it must have been just as   
 difficult for the people who did the  
 carvings. The sandstone is soft but   
 these strange patterns were carved out
 with the use of very simple tools eg.a
 piece of sharpened harder rock.Each of
 the carvings has a diameter of about  
 30 cms.                               </content>
