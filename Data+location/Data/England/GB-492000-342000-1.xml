		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content> The main physical features of this    
 region are:a scarp and dip slope      
 running noth-south along the eastern  
 edge;the river Witham, which meanders 
 away to the north-east and a ridge of 
 higher ground intruding from the      
 north.                                
 This intrusion causes a natural fork  
 for the A607 to branch to Sleaford    
 becoming the A153.                    
 The only settlement of note is the    
 village of Honington which is situated
 in the fork of the roads on the higher
 ground.The village church is dedicated
 to St. Wilfred and has an adjacent    
 open churchyard.                      
 There is a small social club operated 
 from the building which had previously
 housed the school.                    
 Evidence of a roman camp can be seen  
 on the dip slope to the east of the   
 village.                              </content>
