		<content>  There was a fair amount of litter at 
 Ashton Court especially over the road 
 from the Mansion  House .             
  Up in the woods there was not much   
 litter ,most of it was empty cans .We 
 went past the quarry and I didn't     
 notice any litter .There weren't any  
 litter bins until we got to the Ashton
 Court Golf Club .There were  things to
 buy such as cold drinks ,ice creams   
 but there were yellow bins to put     
 rubbish in .People left litter on the 
 tables because they were too lazy to  
 put it in the bin .We all walked down 
 past the cows and into the fields to  
 get back to our school .There was a   
 little litter in the playground {as   
{usual!.
