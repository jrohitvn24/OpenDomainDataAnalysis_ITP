		<title>12  WELLESBOURNE CHURCH</title>
		<content>   One of a few extremely old buildings
in the village is the Anglican Church  
of St.Peter. It is thought that there  
has been a church in Wellesbourne from 
Saxon times-recent excavations brought 
to light signs of Saxon burials.       
   The first known record of the       
village was made by an Anglo-Saxon     
chronicler who recorded that a Witan   
was held in "Waleborne" in AD 862      
by King Burgred of Mercia.It is assumed
that any Saxon church would have been  
constructed of wood. The next mention  
of "Waleborne" is in the Domesday Book.
   The first stone church was built    
here in the late eleventh or twelfth   
century. Tradition attributes the      
building to Henri de Newburgh, one of  
William the Conqueror's knights, to    
whom the Manor of Wellesbourne was     
given.
