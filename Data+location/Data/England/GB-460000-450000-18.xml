		<content> SCHOOL.  TANG HALL PUPIL.             
    I go to junior school.  I like     
 school.  We do lots of exciting things
 like pottery and science. I play      
 soccer for the team but we are not    
 very good.  My teenage brother doesn't
 like school but my fifteen year old   
 sister says its alright.              
                                       
 SCHOOL PLAYTIME.  SAMUEL MAZLOUM.  10.
    At school I usually play football  
 but don't play the normal rules       
 because there aren't enough of us.  We
 have no tackling in the area and no   
 offside rules.  We older ones usually 
 play against the second and third year
 juniors.  I play for the school team  
 at Joseph Rowntree comprehensive      
 school in six a side tournaments.     
 Here the goals are four feet high and 
 ten feet wide.
