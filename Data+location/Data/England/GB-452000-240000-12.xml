		<title>12Wild flowers of the area</title>
		<content> Many of the flowers have suffered from
 the improved farming methods. Many of 
 the flowers now grow along the verges.
 We have made a list of the plants that
 can be seen along the roadside:       
 Bluebells,Red Campion, Common Cow     
 Parsley, Jack by the Hedge,Wild       
 Carrot, Common Mallow, Vetches, Meadow
 Sweet and Rose Bay Willow Herb.       
 In a walk along the disused railway   
 line many of the plants were found    
 along with Ox_Eye Daisies and Red     
 Poppies. We also discovered Cowslips, 
 an Orchid,Sorrel,Buttercups and       
 Vetches.                              
 Many of our flowers still remain under
 threat of disappearing because of     
 improved farming methods.
