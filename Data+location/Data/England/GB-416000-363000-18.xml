		<content>      The village school which opened  
 in 1876 closed in the 1970's to become
 the village hall (held on a token rent
 from the estate and managed by a      
 committee). At present there are 18   
 children of schoolage who mostly      
 attend either the Junior School in    
 Youlgreave or Lady Manners            
 Comprehensive School in Bakewell. Four
 young people are studying at          
 Universities or Colleges.             
                                       
      From time to time adult evening  
 classes are held in the village hall  
 under a scheme organised by Lady      
 Manners School Community Centre.
