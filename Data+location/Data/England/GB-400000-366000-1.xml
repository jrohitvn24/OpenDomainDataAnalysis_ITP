		<content> Our area is in Staffordshire but it   
 is on the borders of Cheshire and     
 Derbyshire. In the north west corner  
 of our area is a bridge at the three  
 shire heads. When you  cross the      
 bridge you can  go in  all the three  
 counties. The Buxton to Leek road     
 passes through our area. We have some 
 houses scattered around the hills. In 
 the village of Flash we have a shop   
 which sells fruit and sweets and milk 
 and all kinds of things. We have a pub
 and it has a bar. In winter it is very
 cold because it is the highest village
 in England. We have a church, we sing 
 in church. We have a village Hall and 
 a school.
