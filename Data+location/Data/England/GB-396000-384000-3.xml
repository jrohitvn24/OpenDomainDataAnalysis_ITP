   The Torrs is a sort of country park 
 opened to the public.    There are two
 rivers that run through the Torrs, the
 River Goyt and the River Sett.    The 
 River Sett runs through most of the   
 Torrs.    There is a weir that runs   
 down to a waterwheel that used to     
 power the Torr Vale Mill.   The river 
 flows to the east.   In June l984 Dr. 
 Millward's bridge was opened, and the 
 centenary of Union Road Bridge was    
 celebrated.   Down the Torrs is the   
 ruin of Torrr Mill   There are        
 steps leading down to an arched       
 doorway, and trees are growing inside.
 The arched windows  and walls are     
 still there, but no roof so it is     
 difficult to imagine how high it was. 
 There are now benches and tables      
 for people to have a picnic on. by
