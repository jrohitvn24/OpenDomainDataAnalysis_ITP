		<content>{ELMSLEY VILLAS and LODGE }are shown   
 clearly on maps that are 10 years or  
 more old.On the most up to date maps  
 it is clear that Elmsley Villas have  
 disappeared completely. All that      
 remains of Elmsley Lodge is an old    
 derelict building that a farmer uses  
 for storing hay. These building were  
 once the homes of the Manager, Deputy 
 Manager and miners and their families 
 that all worked at Rufford Pit. The   
 families didn't like living there     
 miles from shops and schools so they  
 all moved out.
