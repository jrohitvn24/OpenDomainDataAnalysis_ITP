		<title>11Uyeasound Primary School.</title>
		<content> Our school is Uyeasound Primary       
 School. In 1985 there were 9 pupils   
 from 7 families from age 5 to 11.     
   Our teacher is also the Head of the 
 school but every week we have visiting
 teachers for art,music,physical       
 education and remedial education.The  
 Minister takes a class once a month.  
   We have most of our lessons in the  
 new part of the school but we have    
 lessons with visiting teachers in the 
 original school building which in 1984
 was joined to the new building by a   
 corridor with indoor toilets.         
   In 1982 the school celebrated its   
 Centenary.In the old building we set  
 out old furniture and books.We wrote  
 with quill pens and dressed in clothes
 like those worn 100 years ago.
