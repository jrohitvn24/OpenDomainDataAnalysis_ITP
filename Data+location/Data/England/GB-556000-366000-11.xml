		<title>11Derbyshire Miners Centre</title>
		<content> When we arrived at the gate the       
 Security Officer directed us to the   
 Office Manager.After asking her       
 questions about the facilities at the 
 Centre,we walked round counting all   
 the different amenities,such as shops,
 arcades,bingo halls,pools,etc.  On the
 way back,we passed people sitting in  
 deck chairs enjoying the sun and      
 noticed the theatre and cinema where  
 church services are held on Sundays.  
 We also saw 2 large buildings,one of  
 which was a paraplegic unit with      
 special facilities.The other was the  
 convalescent home mostly used by      
 miners.Each week at the beginning and 
 end of the summer they cater for      
 visitors such as Senior Citizens and  
 members of the St. Johns Ambulance    
 Brigade.At the height of the season   
 the chalets and luxury flats are      
 occupied by families from mining areas</content>
