		<title>02Changing Face of Haddenham</title>
		<content> Haddenham is an old Saxon village with
 its church recorded in the Domesday   
 Book. Haddenham now claims to be the  
{largest village in England.           
 The Enclosure Act of 1830 drastically 
 changed village life. As trade        
 expanded the population increased to  
 1545 in 1841.{The houses at this time 
{were mainly cottages}with a few larger
 houses such as{Haddenham Hall.}With   
 the development of machinery the      
 population slumped, until 1906 when   
 the new railway brought some          
 employment. After the Second World War
 the village expanded greatly. In 1955 
 many council houses were built. In the
 1960s and 1970s two major estates were
 built. Although{it has a population of
{5000}it remains a compact village with
 many of the older houses alongside    
 newer properties, and no high rise    
 developments as yet.                  </content>
