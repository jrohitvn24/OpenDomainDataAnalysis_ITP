		<title>18Events in the Butley Area</title>
		<content>Butley is a small village with a very  
small population. There are few people 
to organise or enjoy special events.   
Each year there is a Flower Show which 
is very popular and attended by people 
from a wide area. Cups and prizes are  
awarded for the best entries in flower,
vegetable, cooking, craft and art      
classes. There is a parish council     
which meets at least four times a      
year and a parochial church council    
that has regular meetings. Keep fit    
classes are held in the village hall.  
At Butley Middle School there is an    
open evening Badminton Club. Ayouth    
clubmeets once a week in a modern      
purpose-built building in the school   
grounds. The village hall is in poor   
condition and money is being raised    
for a replacement.
