		<content> There was originally a Tudor Castle on
 this site,built by Henry VIII. The    
 Castle later became a private house,  
 and finally became almost derelict. It
 is nowadays owned by the National     
 Trust, who lease it to the John Lewis 
 Partnership. The castle has been      
 restored and renovated, and is used as
 a holiday centre for employees of John
 Lewis and their families. In 1985 the 
 charge is Â£19.00 per day. Between     
 March and September about 70 guests   
 are staying at the Castle, for up to a
 fortnight's holiday, with 30 staff to 
 serve food and lay on amusements. Some
 holidays include a visit to Poole     
 Regatta, or painting tuition, country 
 dancing displays and a fancy-dress    
 ball.                                 
 The Castle contains a Muniments Room  
 with files of archives and newspaper  
 cuttings concerning the building.     </content>
