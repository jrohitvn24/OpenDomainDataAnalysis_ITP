 Because of new houses a hedge was     
 removed to give access for a new      
 road.A Hedgerow was planted by Kenton 
 School on the 17th May 1985.Each      
 child in class one has a tree to take 
 care of.We go up to the hedgerow about
 every fortnight to water and weed     
 them.When we move on to a senior      
 school other younger children will    
 look after the hedgerow. {            
     {Haydon Common                    
{ }Haydon common is a woodland         
 area.Their are deciduous trees in     
 it.They are all matured which means   
 that the bigger trees strangle the    
 little trees so it is only big trees  
 that live in haydon common.A team are 
 chopping down the big trees so that   
 the little trees can grow.
