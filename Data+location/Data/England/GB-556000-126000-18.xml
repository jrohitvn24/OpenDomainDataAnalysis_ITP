		<title>18Customs in Mayfield.</title>
		<content> Although Mayfield is now a village of 
 many commuters &amp; other newcomers,the  
 old customs have been continued &amp; many
 revived.Amongst the various village   
 organisations is the Women's Institute
 who start the year of activities with 
 their pantomime in the Memorial Hall. 
 The village Band takes part in        
 competitions.Every Saturday there is a
 Jumble Sale.In May on Ascension Day   
 St.Dunstan's Choir sing carols from   
 the Church Tower at 7am.This is the   
 beginning of the 'fete season'        
 organised by different societies,     
 including the village Primary School  
 who also run an 'Its a Knockout'      
 competition.In June we have the       
 Carnival Dance when a local girl is   
 chosen to be the 'Carnival Queen'.    
 Another traditional date is the Summer
 Flower Show when villagers enter their
 various exhibits of flowers &amp; produce.</content>
