		<title>09Local History(Great Ponton)</title>
		<content>   The original settlement may date    
 from Roman times , suggested by       
 numerous finds relating to this period
 and the discovery of a mosaic pavement
 in field OS8763 . There is evidence in
 Greens 'Lincolnshire Towns and        
 Villages' that William the            
 Conqueror,himself,held land here.     
   The village has an uncommon weather 
 vane in the shape of a fiddle.The     
 story goes that a travelling musician 
 who ,on the occasions he passed       
 through Great Ponton,was always well  
 treated.He eventually went to America,
 made a fortune and returning to       
 England gave a golden fiddle in thanks
 for their good fellowship when he was 
 poor.This was copied and placed as a  
 weather vane on the church.           
   It is reported that a monks' escape 
 tunnel still exists between the       
 vicarage and Mill House( 1 mile long).</content>
