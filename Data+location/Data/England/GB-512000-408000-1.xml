		<content> The area allocted to our school is    
 mainly given over to arable farming   
 whilst the remainder is forestry.     
 Population is confined mainly to the  
 village of Great Limber with a few    
 isolated houses and farms scattered   
 throughout the area.                  
 Because of its rural location much of 
 the work has been rather limited and  
 covers such topics as:-               
 The Headteacher,The School,A day at   
 school,The Farm,Local Landmarks,Work  
 in the forest,Road Communications,    
 The Village and its amenities.
