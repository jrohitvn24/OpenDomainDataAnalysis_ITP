		<content> The younger generation have adopted an
 outrageous way of dressing,desperately
 trying to state their individuality.  
 This has caused concern among the     
 middle-aged and older generations.In  
 the way they dress youngsters are     
 tending to imitate famous people who  
 are their heroes,e.g.music stars like 
 "Boy George".                         
 Facial beauty is not considered as    
 important nowadays as it used to be,  
 as there is a wide range of products  
 available to enhance other attractive 
 parts of the body.People are also     
 realising it is better to be slim and 
 healthy and are now taking care about 
 what they eat; for this reason some   
 are vegetarians.                      
 In and around the area there are one  
 or two "transvestites" and a growing  
 "gay" community and this could be     
 described as the latest trend.        </content>
