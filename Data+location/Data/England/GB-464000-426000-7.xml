 In early Summer each year the annual  
 fete is held in Barlow and Drax, known
 locally as "The Feast". These have    
 their origins in farm holidays at the 
 end of haymaking and consist largely  
 of sports, competitions and sideshows 
 with stalls, bands and the crowning of
 the Queen.                            
{Playground Games                      
{Fox and Hounds}is played by dividing  
 the players into two groups. One group
 "the hounds" chase the other group    
 "the foxes". The game ends when all   
 the foxes are caught. Then they change
 roles.                                
{British Bulldog}One person is the     
 bulldog and stands in the middle of   
 the playground. He shouts "British    
 Bulldog" and the other players run    
 across the playground while he tries  
 to catch them.                        </content>
