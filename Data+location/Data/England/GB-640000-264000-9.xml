		<content> On the whole the people are a healthy 
 lot and long lived, but help is       
 available when required. The area is  
 served by two group practices - one in
 Leiston, one in Saxmundham, each with 
 several doctors who will visit those  
 unable or too ill to go to the        
 surgery. Foot care is to be had at    
 clinics through both surgeries and    
 referal in case of need to specialists
 at Ipswich hospital. There are        
 visiting chiropodists and radio       
 therapists for the housebound or      
 patients can be taken by hospital car 
 or ambulance to Aldeburgh clinic or   
 Ipswich. Dental treatment is available
 in nearby towns. When the doctor with 
 whom one is registered is not on hand,
 a colleague is available. Preventative
 medicine is practised. The usual      
 immunisation is available for children
 and travellers going to far off places</content>
