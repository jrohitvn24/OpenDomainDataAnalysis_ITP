		<title>06House Conversions in Keyham</title>
		<content> Keyham contains many houses which have
 been converted by their present or    
 past owners into houses with all the  
 normal, modern amenities. The{Old     
{School House}was built over 100 years 
 ago as part of the Free School        
 Movement. The present owners converted
 it in 1955 from a one-roomed building 
 into the house it now is.             
{Mayfield Barn}was a cow-shed but is   
 now a two-storey house.{Mayfield      
{Cottage}was a simple lean-to shelter  
 for tractors. After conversion it is  
 an attractive single-storey cottage.  
{King's Corner}was a cow shed and      
 stables before builders started work  
 on it. Now it is a very large one-    
 storey family home.
