		<content> The largest of the thatched properties
 in Collingbourne Kingston is the Post 
 Office and General Stores. Once the   
 bakery, the faggot_burning ovens are  
 still to be seen. In spite of the     
 villagers increased mobility the tiny 
 complex still meets a very real need. 
 Newspapers,magazines as well as       
 groceries are also available here.    
 The Post Office at Everleigh, a long  
 standing family business is still     
 managed by the elderly Post Mistress  
 despite being burgled in l984. The    
 village stores was closed some three  
 years ago.                            
 There is a mail collection point in   
 each of the villages with twice daily 
 collections. Postal deliveries are    
 made daily the new houses, and twice  
 daily to older properties.
