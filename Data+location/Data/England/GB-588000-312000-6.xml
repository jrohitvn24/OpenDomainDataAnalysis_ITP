		<content> THERE IS NO HEALTH CENTRE IN THE      
 VILLAGE BUT THERE ARE GOOD SURGERIES  
 IN LITCHAM AND SWAFFHAM WHICH SERVE   
 THIS AREA.  HOSPITALS ARE TO BE FOUND 
 AT KINGS LYNN AND NORWICH             
                                       
 AT SWAFFHAM THERE IS A DAY CENTRE TO  
 WHICH THE ELDERLY AND INFIRM CAN BE   
 TRANSPORTED.   THERE THEY CAN BE      
 BATHED AND HAVE THEIR HAIR WASHED AND 
 MEET OTHER PEOPLE.                    
                                       
 WE HAVE A GOOD HOME HELP AND THE      
 WOMENS INSTITUTE WORK A ROTA SYSTEM TO
 DELIVER MEALS ON WHEELS TO FIVE       
 ELDERLY PEOPLE TWICE WEEKLY,          
 COLLECTING THE MEALS FROM NECTON      
 MIDDLE SCHOOL.
