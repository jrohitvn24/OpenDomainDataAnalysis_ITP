		<title>07Jobs in the Horton area.</title>
		<content>                                       
 In Horton most of the employment is in
 farming.Most people go outside Horton 
 to work,probably commuting to Bristol.
 Some jobs are created by Chipping     
 Sodbury Quarry.But most of these jobs 
 go to people from outside the area.   
 Horton has a post office,one lady     
 works at the post office.Most people  
 who live in the Horton area have come 
 from outside places,and have bought a 
 house.Some people are employed by the 
 Golf Club,but not many .The shop we   
 went in sold 250 units of farm        
 machinery nationwide a year (approx). 
 They don't sell a lot of lawnmowers,  
 when they do it is a mixture of well  
 known makes.They employ 31 people. So 
 it is quite hard to get a job in      
 Horton.
