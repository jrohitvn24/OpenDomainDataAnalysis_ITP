 who lived in a little house on        
 Borrowdale Road, near Boow Laithe.She 
 only had one son, Jack,and a very lazy
 boy he was.He didn't do any work and  
 he hadn't many stamps on his card to  
 entitle him to the dole.As time went  
 on they got poorer and poorer, until  
 the widow had to sell the cow.
