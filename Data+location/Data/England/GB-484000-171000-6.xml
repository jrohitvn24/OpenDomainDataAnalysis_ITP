		<content> Bracknell was the most popular town   
 to do shopping out of places like     
 Reading, Wokingham and Bracknell. In  
 Bracknell, Sainsburys was the most    
 popular shop. Some people used Tescos 
 in Wokingham. In Binfield there are 19
 shops. Here are some of them:         
 Sweetnews, VG, Corner shop, Mace and  
 the Hardware shop, Betting shop and 3 
 Hairdressers. Most people go shopping 
 on Saturdays and Thursdays. We        
 interviewed one person and she said,  
 "Sorry I am not English." Most people 
 agreed that the Shopping Precinct in  
 Binfield was easier for their daily   
 goods when they had run out of        
 something, but some people said that  
 the Shopping Precinct was not easier  
 for their daily goods. Out of the     
 people we interviewed fourteen of them
 used Sainsburys, and nineteen of them 
 went to Bracknell to shop.            </content>
