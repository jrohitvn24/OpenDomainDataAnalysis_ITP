		<title>09An interview with Mr Thrale</title>
		<content> Mr Thrale has been a resident         
 of Sandridge for 6 years though his   
 family have lived there for           
 generations. Mr Thrale previously     
 owned a chain of bakeries in the      
 St.Albans area but has now sold it.   
 His  house overlooks a field in which 
 one of the last battles of the        
 War of the Roses was fought. Mr       
 Thrale's family has a coat of arms.   
 The two broad arrows were awarded to  
 one of his ancestors by Queen         
 Elizabeth I for sheltering her in a   
 barn on Nomansland Common. The colours
 are ore and azure. The crest has an   
 oak tree  and underneath it on either 
 side are two beer barrels which were  
 added when his family became brewers. 
 Below this, is a helmet with a visor  
 down which was awarded to a gentleman.
