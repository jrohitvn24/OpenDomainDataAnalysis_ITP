		<title>08CHANGING TIMES, CALDER VALE</title>
		<content> People who have lived in Calder Vale  
 for a long time have told us that the 
 village has changed quite a lot and   
 the green used to be a quarry until it
 was filled in many years ago.         
                                       
 The houses in Long Row are over a 100 
 years old. In Calder Vale there used  
 to be a cafe and a chip shop.The chip 
 shop used to be in the Mill Square.   
                                       
 There used to be another mill, called 
 Lower Mill, but this was demolished   
 after it was closed down.             
                                       
 Until 15 years ago Calder Vale used to
 have its own brass band.              
                                       
 There used to be a Temperance Hotel   
 where Mount Pleasant now is. This is  
 now a house overlooking the Mill      
 Square.                               </content>
