		<title>15DISADVANTAGES OF RURAL LIFE</title>
		<content>   The same questionnaire produced     
 responses giving a list of drawbacks  
 which,as the responders would likely  
 acknowledge,if rectified,would destroy
 what they came to{Bleasby}and{Thurgar-
{ton}for in the first place!Comments   
 were made about the paucity and cost  
 of{public transport},{prices}at local 
 shops,lack of"sophisticated"entertain-
 ment and amenities,especially for{teen
{ -agers,}inconvenience and cost of    
 travelling,{traffic congestion}for    
 commuters and that there is no local  
 doctor,park or mains gas (Bleasby).   
   Someone found it lonely at first,and
 one or two stated it was hard to have 
 a social life.                        
   Happily,at least two replies stated 
 that there were{no disadvantages.     
   Two final complaints:crop spraying  
 and,delightfully,night ploughing!Would
 our urban brethren sympathise?        </content>
