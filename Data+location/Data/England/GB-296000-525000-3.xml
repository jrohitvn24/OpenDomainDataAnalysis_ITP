		<content>  {Derwent Howe}is an industrial       
 project geared to{private sector      
{development.}This is where local firms
 will be invited to start a business in
 one of the workshops provided on the  
 site.                                 
   The large industries that are to be 
 set up there are still unknown but it 
 is hoped to attract some{high         
{technology industries.                
   There is a{rail making plant}owned  
 by British Steel on part of the       
 site,and is the only one if it's kind 
 outside Japan.                        
   The{MOBET}group who run the scheme  
 decided that the main part of the     
 scheme should be industrial because it
 is hoped to create about{1000 more    
{jobs.}The scheme will have cost Â£10   
 million by mid 1985 and when{completed
{in 1988}the{total cost}will be about  
{Â£14-Â£15 million.                      </content>
