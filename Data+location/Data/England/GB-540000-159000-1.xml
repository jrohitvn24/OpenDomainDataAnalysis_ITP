		<content> GENERAL SURVEY OF BIGGIN HILL         
                                       
       Biggin Hill is a small cummuter 
 town within the London Borough of     
 Bromley and surrounded by London's    
 Green Belt.  Most of the housing is   
 owner-occupied but life styles vary a 
 great deal.  The population has grown 
 rapidly since 1945.  Nearby is Downe  
 Village and the hamlets of Berry's    
 Green, Single Street and Luxted.      
       Much of the land in the area    
 used to be for farming but large areas
 are now used for recreation.  There   
 are two golf clubs, a scout camp and  
 several stables, an annual air fair is
 important for tourism.                
       The R.A.F. station made the area
 famous during the Battle of Britain.  
 Now it is a busy civillian airport    
 with many of the flights being for    
 recreation.                           </content>
