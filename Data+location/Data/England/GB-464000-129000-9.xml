 bell weighs 1/5 of a tonne &amp; is called
 the treble.The heaviest is the tenor, 
 it weighs 3/4 of a tonne.We practice  
 each Thursday 7.30-9.00 and Rodney    
 Skinner teaches us.There are about 6  
 adults &amp; 9 children in the group.I    
 have been learning for about a year. I
 usually ring the treble or 2.         
 Choir practice night is Wednesday 6.15

 Mrs Longlands is organist &amp; choir     
 mistress.I have been in the choir for 
 3 years.When you join you get a card  
 of tests &amp; you work your way through  
 them.When you join you get a white    
 surplice &amp; then as you pass tests you 
 get different coloured ribbons - light
