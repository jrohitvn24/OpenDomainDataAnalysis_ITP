		<content>  I normally get out of bed at 7.00a.m.
 eager to get to school. I usually     
 leave the house at 8.25 and on the way
 to school stop to buy sweets at the   
 village shop. Before school starts I  
 like to watch the boys play cricket.  
 The Headmistress rings the bell at    
 9.00 then we walk round the outside of
 the school and come in through the    
 porch door.                           
  As you walk through the door into the
 classroom you see seven tables. We    
 have lockers instead of a desk. We    
 have a table which can take eight     
 people and we have a locker of our own
 to store all our equipment in.        
  The first lesson we usually do is    
 Maths. We follow the Fletcher Maths   
 scheme. At 10.30 a welcome break for  
 playtime. There are only two classes  
 in our school which is lovely as we   
 get to know the teachers very well.   </content>
