 1958.They keep sheep and cattle for   
 meat to sell,as well as two horses,   
 hens and dogs.The dogs are kept to    
 guard the house,the hens for their    
 eggs.The farm is divided into three   
 parts,the roads which divide them are 
 the A68 and the A698 to Wolsingham.

 field to normal farm use.
