		<title>14ST. MARGARET'S CHURCH.</title>
		<content>   The{Parish church in Denton}dates   
 back to the 13th century but was      
 largely rebuilt and Victorianised 600 
 years later.                          
   Over 60 years ago, a choir boy      
 carefully studied the tracts of       
 distemper on the featureless walls    
 inside the church. In 1970,{Henry Bird
 the same choir boy and well-known     
 painter exhibited huge cartoons at the
 Guildhall in Northampton. Proposals   
 for the{redecoration}of the Denton    
 Church showed, for instance, an       
 abortive attempt by water board       
 officials to demolish the village     
 pump; however, 3 angry local ladies   
 had other ideas. Other notable scenes 
 depict a Saxon paying homage to a     
 Norman with the{village's dovecote}in 
 the background and a collection of    
 Biblical characters with faces of     
 local villagers.                      </content>
