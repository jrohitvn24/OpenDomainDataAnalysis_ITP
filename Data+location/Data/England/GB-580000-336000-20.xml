		<content> A feature of this intensively         
 cultivated area is the lack of land   
 which is in a relatively wild state,  
 considerably reducing its wildlife    
 potential.  The churchyard has not    
 been sprayed and still has a fairly   
 typical grassland flora, but          
 over-zealous mowing, especially in    
 spring is reducing some species.      
 Maidenhair spleenwort fern (Asplenium 
 adiantum nigrum) has persisted on the 
 church tower for at least 150 years.  
 A small stretch of disused railway    
 line in the north of the parish has   
 some chalk plants, survivors of the   
 now ploughed grassland of the last    
 century.  Hedgehogs, moles, rabbits,  
 grey squirrels and small rodents are  
 frequent and foxes are sometimes seen.
 Winter bird visitors include flocks of
 curlew and hunting hen harriers with  
 several hundred geese on fields.      </content>
