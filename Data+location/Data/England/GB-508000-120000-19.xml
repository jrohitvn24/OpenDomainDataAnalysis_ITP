		<title>19Local Airfields</title>
		<content> There was a small airfield near Apsley
 Farm during and after the first World 
 War, and a present member of West     
 Chiltington W.I. well remembers being 
 taken there by her father to see Sir  
 Alan Cobham's Flying Circus, and to   
 have her first flight in a tiny plane.
 A little farther north, to the east of
 Coolham crossroads, a larger airfield 
 was used in World War II to give home-
 coming planes an emergency landing    
 area. Barracks were built alongside   
 the B.2139. The local farmers still   
 sometimes turn up live ammunition, and
 the remains of a crashed plane lie    
 buried deep in a nearby wood.         
    Arun Feeds, a small agricultural   
 manufacturing concern on the road to  
 Shipley from Hungerhill, was built in 
 the mid-1930s by the Milk Marketing   
 Board, for drying and using grass from
 this airfield, for cattlefeed.        </content>
