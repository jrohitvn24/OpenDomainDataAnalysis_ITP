		<content>   The River Stour flows eastwards till
 it is joined by the Glem and the Chad;
 then it turns south towards Sudbury.  
   The district enclosed in the angle  
 is the most northerly part of Essex.  
 It is all farmland (with a few small  
 copses), up to about 30 metres above  
 the river level, rising gently from   
 the east but much more steeply in the 
 north.  There are three small villages
 -{Foxearth, Pentlow and Borley}- and a
 tiny one called{Lyston.               
   Along the river there are three old 
 water-mills, now private houses, one  
 at each village except Foxearth (which
 lies inland and had a windmill) and a 
 picnic-site on the Suffolk bank.      
 Lyston has a factory, spanning both   
 banks, where they distil 'essential   
 oils'; it is known as The Chemical    
 Works or just The Comicals.
