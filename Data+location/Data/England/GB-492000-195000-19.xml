		<title>19THE GREEN LADY.</title>
		<content> After the battle of Sedgmoor a        
 Monmouth supporter on the run was     
 hidden in a grotto in the grounds of  
 Woodrow High House by his fiancee Lady
 Helena Stanhope,ward of the owner Sir 
 Peter Bostock.A maid saw her taking   
 food to him,and told the troops in    
 Amersham.The next time Lady Helena    
 took food to him she found her lover  
 had been discovered and killed. Broken
 hearted,she returned to the house and 
 poisoned herself.Many people have seen
 her ghost walking down the stairs,    
 passing through a window (which used  
 to be the front door)and visiting the 
 grotto.She then returns to the house  
 weeping,and then drinks from a bottle 
 from a cupboard in the Cromwell room. 
 There is a large portrait of her in a 
 green dress in the house,and,where-   
 ever you sit in the room, the eyes    
 seem to follow you..........          </content>
