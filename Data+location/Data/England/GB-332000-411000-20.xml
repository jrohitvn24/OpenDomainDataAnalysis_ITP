		<title>20A BIRKDALE HOUSEWIFE</title>
		<content> The Birkdale housewife I interviewed  
 finds that as a mother supplementry   
 benefit is not adequate.The money does
 not even cover the food that her      
 children require for a week never mind
 clothes.Since the benefit is so low   
 and her husband is relatively low paid
 as a teacher she has a part time job  
 as a private job as a teacher.This    
 money is greatly appreciated as an    
 extra income.The housewife has noticed
 how much differance modern appliances 
 have made like the washing            
 machine,tumble drier and central      
 heating.She says that she is often    
 heard saying,"I don't know how I      
 managed before without it!" refering  
 to the micro-wave oven.Despite these  
 modern appliances much time is still  
 spent doing housework.
