		<title>02CHANGES IN S.DOWNS LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content>    The traditional S.Downs landscape  
 of short flower-dotted turf remained  
 unchanged until the years following   
 the l939-45 war.  Grazing sheep kept  
 rough grass in check, &amp; chalkland     
 flowers &amp; beech woods flourished      
 undisturbed.                          
    Modern farming methods have changed
 the face of the Downs.  The turf has  
 nearly all been ploughed up &amp; planted 
 with cereal crops &amp; grass. The plough 
 has brought to the surface quantities 
 of flints &amp; lumps of broken chalk.    
 Some of the land is now managed grass-
 land, &amp; Friesian bullocks &amp; heifers   
 graze in place of sheep.              
    Conservationists are struggling to 
 keep down scrub &amp; coarse grass on the 
 N. face &amp; have succeeded in preserving
 many of the rarer orchids &amp; other     
 plants in some areas - e.g. Heyshott  
 &amp; Graffham Down Conservation areas.   </content>
