 June.  It is held on the Recreation   
 Ground next to the Lyne Club in Lyne  
 Lane.  The fete starts with a         
 procession of floats from Almners     
 Priory led by a band or dance troupe. 
 They travel along Almners Road and    
 Lyne Lane to the Recreation Ground    
 where they are judged.                
      There are a variety of stalls and
 sideshows, refreshments in the Lyne   
 Club and a tank provided by the army  
 division from Longcross for the       
 children to explore.  Throughout the  
 afternoon a Five-a-side football      
 competition is held and displays of   
 dancing and singing are carried out by
 the Village school and other local    
 childrens clubs.  The proceeds from   
 the fete are divided between the      
 church and the Lyne Club.             </content>
