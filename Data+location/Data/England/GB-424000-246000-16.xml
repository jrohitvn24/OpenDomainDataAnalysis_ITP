		<content> Ettington Church of England Primary   
 School is a school of about 130       
 children aged between four and a half 
 years and eleven.At present their are 
 five full time teachers, a part time  
 teacher and a part time helper.There  
 are also three cooks who make school  
 dinners for the children and for      
 Newbold School, who no longer have    
 kitchen facilities and there are two  
 cleaners who come in after school has 
 finished to keep the school clean.    
 The school is housed in buildings     
 which date back to the 1960's,the old 
 school buildings having fallen into a 
 bad state of repair and been sold for 
 renovation and conversion into a      
 private house.There is a good sized   
 playing field with football pitch     
 jumping pits and outdoor swimming     
 pool.
