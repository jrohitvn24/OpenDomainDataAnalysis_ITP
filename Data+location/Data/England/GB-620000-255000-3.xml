  Similarly,the early medieval period  
has left behind only scant remains;    
visually,The Mount at Otley Bottoms,   
now thought to be the site of the Manor
of Netherhall,is the most              
prominent.Slightly later the church was
rebuilt in stone.                      
  The liberal scatter of moated        
homestead sites in the village, most of
them now fragmentary if not completely 
erased, bear witness to a thriving     
community in the middle and later years
of the medieval period, and field      
walking is currently bringing to light 
a growing number of more humble        
dwellings of similar date. It is       
possible that just a few of the extant 
timber-framed houses have their origins
in the latter part of the Middle Ages, 
although close analysis of their       
construction has to be undertaken.     </content>
