		<content> Our street is full of people who are  
 kind and helpful. A lot of pensioners 
 live in our street,the oldest is 87.He
 fought in the 1914-18 and the         
 1939-1945 wars and has got a lot of   
 medals.                               
 I have made lots of new friends       
 because many of the old people are    
 dying and new families are moving in. 
 On hot days people just sit on their  
 doorstep,reading and sunbathing.The   
 kids are always playing football or   
 riding their BMX bikes.At night our   
 street is very noisy due to the cars  
 going into the local garage.          
 We made a bar chart of the "size of   
 families" in the two top-classes in   
 our school.The survey involved 45     
 children and revealed that the average
 size-of-family was 5 people.The       
 largest family had 11 members and the 
 smallest family had only 2 members.   </content>
