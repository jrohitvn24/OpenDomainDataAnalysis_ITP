<title>26Calne Lantern Parade</title>
<content>

The Lantern Parade is a yearly event when the Christmas lights in Calne get officially turned on and Calne gets turned into a winter wonderland! Everyone who takes part holds a lantern with a light inside so the lanterns glow as everyone takes the parade down the street. &lt;br />&lt;br />Santa usually turns up at this event with his sleigh and reindeers and one lucky child gets to ride down the parade with Santa on his sleigh. They decided the lucky child by holding a big competition and whoever wins riding with Santa is their prize! &lt;br />&lt;br />There are stalls selling sweets, candyfloss, toys and lots more!! &lt;br />&lt;br />Schools take part in this event and help to make the lanterns with a professional. They make the lanterns out of bamboo canes and special tissue paper! &lt;br />&lt;br />‘The lanterns are spectacular!’ Carrie Anne, yr 5&lt;br />&lt;br />‘It is extraordinary and wondrous and is always a pleasure to watch’ Billey, Yr 6. &lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
