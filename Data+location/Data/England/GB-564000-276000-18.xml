		<content>    A CAR IS ESSENTIAL,A FACT GENERALLY
AGREED BY PEOPLE LIVING IN THIS AREA.  
BUSES ARE FEW, CERTAINLY NOT DAILY, AND
INCONVENIENT, SO THAT ONE CAN BE       
STRANDED FOR HOURS IN THE TOWN WHILE   
WAITING FOR A RETURNING BUS.           
    VISITS TO DOCTORS AND DENTISTS MEAN
A TRIP INTO MILDENHALL,BURY ST. EDMUNDS
OR NEWMARKET.THE SAME GOES FOR CINEMAS,
THEATRES, EDUCATION AND SPORTS CENTRES.
WEST ROW HAS NO BUTCHER SO HOUSEWIVES  
GENERALLY SHOP IN TOWN SUPERMARKETS.   
    THERE IS A POST-OFFICE, IRONICALLY 
LICENCED TO ISSUE EVERYTHING BUT NOT A 
CAR TAX! THE LIBRARY VAN VISITS ONCE A 
FORTNIGHT. WEST ROW PROUDLY BOASTS A   
WELL-ORGANISED PLAYING FIELDS ASSOCIAT-
ION PROVIDING IN THE VILLAGE -FOOTBALL,
TENNIS,INDOOR BOWLS,AND PLAY AREAS.    
THERE ARE VARIOUS CHURCH AND CHAPEL    
GROUPS,A YOUTH CLUB, A W.I. AND OF     
COURSE, THERE IS THE SPEEDWAY!         </content>
