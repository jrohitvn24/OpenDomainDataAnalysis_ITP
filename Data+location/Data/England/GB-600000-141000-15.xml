The cinema is a place to watch films   
and enjoy yourself.  It is used by     
people who wish to pay to see the      
latest films unavailable for use in    
the home, on television or video. The  
building is large and dirty. Inside    
it is big with two floors with rooms   
for two different films to be shown.   
There is a sweet shop. One girl of 11  
reported that she had been there twice 
to see "BMX Bandits" and               
"Ghostbusters" both of which were      
worth going to see. She would like to  
see "Never Ending Story". Fewer people 
go to the cinema these days for many   
can hire older films for use with      
their home video. This enables films   
to be viewed at home,.  on the         
television.
