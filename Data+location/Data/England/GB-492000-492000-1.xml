		<title>01FORESTS NORTH OF BROXA</title>
		<content> Predominantly a forested block for    
 commercial softwood production. The   
 southern area has some farmed land in 
 the small valleys and ridge tops,     
 primarily grain and grassland for     
 sheep. Characteristic scenery of flat 
 topped hills disected by steep sided  
 river walleys. In south often only the
 upper slopes are forested and the     
 lower slopes and valley and the flat  
 tops are farmed. The river Derwent    
 bisects the area. The scenery is      
 spectacular and much visited by       
 tourists, mainly on foot because      
 public roads hardly touch on this     
 area. There are many footpaths and    
 rights of way for the walker though.  
 There are very few residents and those
 few there are seem to be involved in  
 farming.
