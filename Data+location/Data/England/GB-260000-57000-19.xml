		<title>19Population in Cornwood</title>
		<content> Although the population has altered   
 little over many years in actual numb-
 ers,it has changed in its make-up. In 
 the churchyard,old family names are   
 repetitious,remaining fairly constant 
 until World War 2.From then on new    
 names occur more rapidly.Now,few peo- 
 ple marry within the parish,causing   
 constant movement of pop. both into   
 and out of the area.The motor-car has 
 made Cornwood a dormer for Plymouth's 
 labour force and also a pleasant coun-
 try residence for some naval families 
 attached to Devonport,many of whom    
 stay only a few years.Houses &amp; cott-  
 ages are constantly on the market;    
 Dartmoor Park restrictions lending    
 them certain advantages over the high-
 density estates of nearby Ivybridge.  
 This flow of pop. and an increase in  
 private transport has led to a break- 
 down of community spirit in Cornwood. </content>
