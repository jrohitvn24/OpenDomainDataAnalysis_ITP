		<title>08PADBURY AND HILLESDEN FARMS</title>
		<content> The majority of the land between the  
 villages is owned by 3 distinct land  
 owners, though there are some small   
 privately owned farms. Several farms  
 are worked by tenants on behalf of All
 Souls College, Oxford.A group of farms
 have recently been acquired by a      
 business consortium and are run by    
 managers. The third group are owned by
 a local farmer who is a generous      
 benefactor to the local community. The
 land is approximately two thirds      
 arable and one third grazing. The main
 crops are wheat, barley and oilseed   
 rape. The grazing is used for sheep   
 and cattle, mainly Herefords,         
 Shorthorns and Jerseys. Some of the   
 grassland is reputed not to have been 
 under the plough since the Enclosures 
 Act and signs of strip cultivation can
 still be seen particularly to the     
 north and west of Padbury.            </content>
