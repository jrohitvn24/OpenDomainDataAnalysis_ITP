		<content>{St. Mary the Virgin, Goldington}      
                                       
    The church dates back to the       
 thirteenth century with major         
 additions in the fourteenth, fifteenth
 and nineteenth centuries.             
    Several local events are organised 
 there, such as the fete and the flower
 festival. There are also numerous     
 groups that meet on a regular basis   
 such as The Mother and Toddlers group,
 The Drama group, The Bible Reading    
 Fellowship and several groups for men,
 for women and for young people. These 
 groups strive not only to bring people
 together but also to deal with their  
 religious and social concerns.        
  The church acts as a focal point     
 around which such activities can be   
 organised and together with its role  
 as a centre of religion forms an      
 indispensable part of the community.  </content>
