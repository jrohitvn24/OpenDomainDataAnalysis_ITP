		<content>   The principal land owner is the     
 North West Water Board, but the land  
 is rented to local farmers. A vetinary
 surgeon owns 70 acres of farmland, and
 large areas of residential land. A    
 herd of 16 wild ponies roams on this  
 farmland. A consortium of Manchester  
 businessmen own 23 acres which is used
 for hay production. The local farmers 
 concentrate on sheep and hill cattle, 
 the sheep being Gimmer Shearling, the 
 cattle Herefords. Much of the land is 
 too poor for farming and is left as   
 moorland. Two farmers operate as      
 milkmen, buying 8,000 pints of milk   
 each from Dairy Crest of Bamber       
 Bridge. One farmers owns 500 hens and 
 sells eggs, as well as milk and cream.
