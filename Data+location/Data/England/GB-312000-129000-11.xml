 Questionnaire ( continued )           
                                       
 Is this farm typical of a farm in this
 part of Somerset?                     
 If so, why?                           
                                       
 Yes it is typical because it's a dairy
 farm with some arable crops. The round
 pillars supporting the roof of the    
 cowesheds are typical of Somerset     
 farms.

 We found out that the 70 cows take    
 nearly 2 hours to milk. There are two 
 bulls. We all enjoyed our visit to the
 farm apart from Dominic who fell over 
 into some manure. Mr Day hosed him    
 down. Mr Mason wasn't very pleased.   </content>
