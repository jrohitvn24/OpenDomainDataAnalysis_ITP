		<title>17Children's Games</title>
		<content> These are some of the most popular    
 games we play at school.              
                                       
{Bulldog}- There are two safe homes one
 at each end. The idea of the game is  
 to get from one end to the other      
 without being touched. One person     
 tries to stop the others from getting 
 across.                               
                                       
{Squash}- One person runs, two people  
 count to twenty and then they run     
 after him or her and when those two   
 people are next to the one person they
 squash them. Warning: play this game  
 on soft ground only.                  
                                       
{Haunted House}- One person pretends to
 be a mummy. The other people have to  
 run round a certain thing. If they get
 touched they become the mummy.
