		<title>05  HIGHAM CHURCH</title>
		<content> Higham has two churches,an old church 
 and a new church.The older church is  
 near to Shorne marshes.It holds       
 roughly 150 people and was built by   
 the Saxons and extended by the        
 Normans.However,25 years ago the      
 church stopped being used regularly.It
 is now only used for three services   
 each year.However it is open all      
 year round and is visited by many     
 tourists.The new church is in         
 Telegraph Hill.The church holds       
 roughly about 200 people and is used  
 only by the people of Higham.One of   
 the walls of the church is made from  
 part of the old Rochester bridge.There
 is a modern hall to the side of the   
 church which is used extensively by   
 many varied groups connected to the   
 church.These include a youth          
 club,womens groups and choir singers.
