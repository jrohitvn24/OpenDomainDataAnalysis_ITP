		<content> A Roman road ran througn Stratton and 
 that is why the village is called     
 Stratton on the Fosse.Stratton comes  
 from the word which meand flat stone  
 and Fosse means a ditch.              
 A railway used to run through         
 Chilcompton.Trains went from Bath to  
 Bournemouth.The line closed in 1966   
 but there is still a blocked off      
 tunnel and some bridges left.         
 The area used to be a busy coal mining
 place and most of the people who lived
 in the villages worked at the mines.  
 The mine closed in 1968.The miners had
 to find other jobs or,the older ones  
 retired.There are a lot of old miners 
 still living in the villages.They     
 still get free coal from the National 
 Coal Board.Some of them have          
 collecions of old mining lamps.There  
 is a very big coal tip in the area.
