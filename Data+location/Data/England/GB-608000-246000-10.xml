		<title>10THE SWARBRICK FAMILY</title>
		<content>  My day is spent doing household      
chores.I tidy up the childrens bedrooms
and make the beds.The longest job is   
cleaning the kitchen as we have two    
dogs,a labrador retriver and a springer
spaniel and they always make a mess.   
  If the weather is good I potter about
in the garden,weeding the borders,     
cutting the grass and keeping the      
greenhouse tidy.                       
  The children come out of school at   
3:3Opm and 3:45pm I collect them in the
car and arrive home to cook  their     
tea.   My husband has his seperatly as 
he never gets home before 7:OOpm.      
  In the evening we all relax,either   
watching T.V or sitting in the garden  
discussing the days happenings,we      
retire to bed early as my husband has  
another early start and the children   
school.                                
                                       </content>
