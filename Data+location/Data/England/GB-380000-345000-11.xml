		<content>Silverdale County Primary was built in 
1872 by the Wolstanton School Board,and
since then there have been many changes
to the building.There used to be a     
chimney and an open fire.There are huge
metal rods which tie the walls together
in case of subsidence caused by mining.
Our Infant Department is in a very     
modern building.It is called an open   
plan school as there are no doors to   
the classrooms.The floors are carpeted.
Cherry Hill School is in Knutton.It is 
a modern building made of wood,brick   
and plasterboard.It has large glass    
windows and a flat roof.               
Keele University was founded in 1949   
using old military buildings.These have
now been replaced by modern,purpose    
built ones,the most recent one being a 
new computer centre.The University has 
many facilities which are available to 
the people of Keele village.           </content>
