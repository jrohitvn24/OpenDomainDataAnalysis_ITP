		<content>A SURVEY BY A GROUP 11 YEAR OLDS - FOOD
DRINKS. In our area the most popular   
was beer which was closely followed by 
Coke. They prefer cold drinks to hot.  
BREAKFAST. For breakfast we found Rice-
Crispies is the most popular cereal.   
This wasn't such a good total overall  
only just beating cornflakes.          
LUNCH. Skem picked chips with a massive
poll. Sausage was hot on their trail   
while pie, beans and peas followed a   
long way behind.                       
EVENING MEAL. In our area, the most    
popular hot food was chips and beans   
with chips and sausage hot on their    
track. For sweet they all said cake.   
SNACKS. The most popular snack was     
sweets with 46 votes. This was very    
good because we only asked 62 people.  
Cake, crisps, burger, sausage-roll and 
sandwiches each averaged a little under
4 votes.                               </content>
