		<content>    Since the Second World War the     
population of this area has increased  
considerably so that original local    
families are in a minority.Taking a    
sample survey of 175 families,about 43%
of the members were born locally,though
many of these are still children.By far
the greatest number of newer           
inhabitants have come from the Greater 
London area or the counties surrounding
Bucks.,but most counties of England are
represented.Other parts of the UK are  
included too,as are countries          
stretching from New Zealand in the East
through India,Africa and Europe to     
Canada in the West.                    
    Family sizes show that 58% of our  
sample have four members and nearly 26%
have five,with 10% of six or more.The  
majority of families in the whole area 
have children of school age,though the 
number of school pupils is declining.  </content>
