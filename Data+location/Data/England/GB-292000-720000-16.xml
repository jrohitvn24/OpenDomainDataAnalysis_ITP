 One person stands at the wall and     
 shouts out a TV programme. We run if  
 we think we know it. If we are wrong  
 we go back down to think again. But if
 we are correct, we change places with 
 the leader.                           
           {POLO                       
 One person stands at the wall and     
 shouts out names of trees or something
 and we stand in a circle and pick a   
 favorite tree.Whoever chose the name  
 of the tree he picks, runs and trys to
 beat the leader and then say " Polo." 
     {FAIRY STEPS AND GIANT STEPS      
 Children stand in a line. The         
 leader,hiding his eyes or blindfold,  
 calls someone by name and tells them  
 to take so many giant, or long steps, 
 or else so many fairy ,or short,steps.
 First person to reach the wall is the 
 winner.                               </content>
