		<title>03ENGLISH CHINA CLAY (cont)</title>
		<content>      Stent, or waste rock exposed by  
 the monitors is removed from the      
 bottom of the pit by dumper trucks so 
 that fresh pit faces are always being 
 used.                                 
     The mixture of water, sand and    
 clay goes to the lowest point of the  
 pit, and is pumped to the sand        
 separation plant. The coarse sand is  
 removed, and the water, mica and      
 sand are pumped to the cyclone        
 separators. More of the mica is then  
 removed, and the slurry is passed to  
 dewatering tanks. More refining then  
 removes the remaining sand and mica   
 which are pumped to the settling      
 lagoon. The clay is then refined      
 further. The clay is then sent to     
 storage tanks and then to filter      
 presses, and is dried in rotary       
 driers, such as those at Par.
