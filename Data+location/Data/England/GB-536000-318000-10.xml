		<title>10THE SCHOOL-SUTTON ST JAMES</title>
		<content> The original school was built in 1859 
 at a cost of Â£800, and there were 166 
 children to start with. Ninety years  
 later in 1949, it became an all-age   
 school, with an age range of 4-15.    
 In 1958, the Peele School in Long     
 Sutton was opened, and senior pupils  
 were transferred there.               
 In 1971, a new school was built to    
 accommodate children from Sutton St.  
 James, Holbeach St. John and Sutton   
 St. Edmund- these last two villages   
 had their own schools closed. A part  
 of the old school still exists, but,  
 when the kitchen is converted into a  
 classroom, the Horsa block will be    
 closed. This is not expected to happen
 for a year or two.The main school is  
 modern, light and airy, and there is a
 good hall with fixed P.E. apparatus.  
 Outside there is a large playing      
 field.                                </content>
