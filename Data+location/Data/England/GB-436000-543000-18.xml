		<title>18*AT SCHOOL IN OUR VILLAGE*</title>
		<content>{I live at Haswell Plough. I am eleven 
{years old.                            
      When I arrive at school I go to  
 see if my teacher has arrived. If she 
 hasn't I wait outside for her. When   
 she does arrive she asks me to do     
 various little jobs. When it gets to 9
 A.M the rest of the school comes in.  
       If it is a Tuesday which is my  
 favourite day we have an assembly     
 first. Then we come back and sit in   
 our groups and do language work until 
 play. After play we have Maths through
 until dinner. After dinner I go       
 through to the Nursery and get some   
 recorder music as I have my own       
 recorder. Then at 1 P.M the girls have
 needlework and the boys have craft.   
 That takes us up to play. After that  
 we have singing then P.E. By that time
 it is hometime for most pupils but we 
 have activity night.                  </content>
