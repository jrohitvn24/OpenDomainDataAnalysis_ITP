		<content> The decoration of the interior is     
 largely as it was at the time of      
 Robert Walpole.The removal of the     
 pictures resulted in some alterations 
 after the house came through the      
 female line to the Cholmondeley family
 on the death of Horace Walpole in     
 1797.In the CABINET ROOM, the original
 hangings were replaced with Chinese   
 hand painted wallpaper.The fourth     
 EARL of CHOLMONDELEY created MARQUESS 
 in 1815, was a great friend of the    
 PRINCE REGENT who gave specially woven
 silk hangings from SPITALFIELDS for   
 walls and curtains, a new carpet ,    
 probably WILTON,and English furniture 
 with woven tapestry covers for the    
 re-decoration of the present WHITE    
 DRAWING ROOM.The chandelier supplied  
 by PARKER &amp;PERRYof LONDON dates from  
 about 18O5.
