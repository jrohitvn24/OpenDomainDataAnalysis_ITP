     MANY OF THE TRADITIONAL DISHES OF 
 THE AREA APPEAR TO HAVE SO DECLINED IN
 POPULARITY THAT THEY DID NOT FEATURE  
 IN THE SURVEY OF FOODS EATEN. A RANGE 
 OF PIES AND PASTIES CONTAINING        
 FILLINGS SUCH AS{EGG AND PARSLEY}OR   
{EGG AND LEEK ;JUNKETS,}MADE FROM MILK 
 AND RENNET, AND{CUTROUNDS,}A FORM OF  
 BREAD ROLL, HAD ALL DISAPPEARED FROM  
 THE LIST OF FOODS EATEN BY ABOUT FORTY
 LOCAL FAMILIES DURING ONE WEEK. MEAT  
 AND VEGETABLE{PASTIES}HAD BEEN EATEN  
 BY 16 PERCENT OF THE FAMILIES         
 SURVEYED, IN EQUAL PROPORTIONS OF     
 HOME-MADE AND BOUGHT VARIETIES. DEVON 
{CLOTTED CREAM}WAS EATEN BY ONLY 8 PER 
 CENT OF THOSE SURVEYED.               
     BY CONTRAST A NUMBER OF{FOREIGN   
 FOODS, INCLUDING{PIZZA, SPAGHETTI     
{BOLOGNAISE, PAELLA, MUESLI, QUICHE}AND
{CROISSANTS}WERE RECORDED.             </content>
