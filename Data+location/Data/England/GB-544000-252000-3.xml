		<title>03Trumpington Church</title>
		<content>    Founded in 1220 AD, Trumpington    
 church is a pleasant aspect of        
 Trumpington. We did not see the       
 present vicar, Thomas Young MA.       
                                       
    There are many interresting factors
 of this church, for instance the tomb 
 of{Sir Rodger de Trumpington,}who was 
 a valiant knight (possibly the bearer 
 of one of the Coeur de Leons in       
 the crusades) lies there and above    
 his tomb is a brass rubbing. Another  
 was the founder of the present{Post   
{Office.                               
                                       
    The church itself is an old        
 stone building with a high bell tower,
 with a fully functional bell, dating  
 back to 1450 AD. There is some        
 magnificent stained glass and a       
 working organ set into the bell tower.
