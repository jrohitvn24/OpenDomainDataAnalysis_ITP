		<title>14The growth of houses</title>
		<content>  Two of the oldest houses found in our
 area date back to 1880 and according  
 to one of the occupants were the only 
 houses amidst an area covered by clay 
 and coal pits. They were built by{R.  
{Stanley,}the owner of the local       
 brickworks,for himself and his general
 manager. As land became available for 
 house building it eminated from 3     
 centres:{Nuneaton; Stockingford;}and  
{Chapel End.}It was largely made up of 
 small terraced houses with            
 accompanying local businesses. These  
 contrast with the more modern estates 
 where virtually every house has its   
 own garage and local amenities are    
 few. The 3 areas mentioned were really
 cemented together with the building of
 the vast{Camp Hill}council estate     
 which dominates the area. More private
 estates are eroding the remaining open
 and farm land.                        </content>
