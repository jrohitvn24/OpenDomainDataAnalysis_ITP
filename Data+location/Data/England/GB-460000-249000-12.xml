		<title>12Blakesley Soapbox Grand Prix</title>
		<content>The Blakesley Grand Prix was on the    
18th September at 1.30p.m. infront of  
about 3000 people. A soapbox is a four 
wheeled vehicle without propulsion     
(except for a ramp or hill) but with   
brakes and steering. 38 soapboxes took 
part in 4 classes. The course was 600  
metres long and dropped 20 metres. A 6 
metre ramp at the start launched the   
soapboxes in pairs at up to 80 km.p.h. 
There were other attractions; a radio  
controlled model aircraft battle with  
bombs; an antiques fair and a display  
of old tractors which pulled them back 
to the start. The event raised over    
4000 pounds for the Royal National     
Lifeboat Institution. The fastest time 
was set by "Newton's Wrong" in 52.79   
seconds and the novelty club was won by
"Tigger's Trucking Co." a beautiful    
model lorry.
