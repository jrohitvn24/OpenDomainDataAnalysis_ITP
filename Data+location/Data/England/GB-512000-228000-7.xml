		<content> Sheep used to be the main farming in  
 the area,all the land being left to   
 grassland.Cereals were introduced in  
 1950,as a more profitable form of     
 farming.Now sheep are only found on   
 Deacon Hill.The Deacon is a 'Site of  
 Special Scientific Interest'(SSSI)    
 where the Nature Conservancy Council  
 aim to preserve animal, bird, insect  
 and plant life.The Deacon, which is   
 an old grazed chalk downland, is of   
 considerable botanical interest.Also  
 within the farm is a mound called     
 Knocking Hoe,which is a National      
 Nature Reserve(designated by the      
 Leisure Conservancy Council in June   
 1958)This area is of botanical        
 interest,sheltering many low growing  
 chalk downland species of plant.      
 Seven Hundred yards east of the farm  
 is an ancient monument,a pre-Christian
 Saxon burial barrow.                  </content>
