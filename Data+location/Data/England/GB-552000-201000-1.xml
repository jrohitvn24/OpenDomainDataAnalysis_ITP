		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO ONGAR</title>
		<content> Ongar has 6000 inhabitants.{Chelmsford
 the county town is eleven miles away. 
 Chipping Ongar comes from the Saxon   
{Cheaping Angre}which means{"market on 
{the wooded slope";}though there is no 
 longer a market in Ongar.             
  We do not know at what time the      
 Saxons were here, because they left no
 written records, all we can tell is   
 that they were here after the Romans  
 but before the Normans. We know this  
 because there is a will from 1044,    
 mentioning Ongar.                     
  Ongar is a large village or small    
 town, depending on definition.  There 
 are a variety of architectural styles 
 along the main street e.g. Tudor,     
 Regency and Victorian.                
  Brentwood and Epping are both 7      
 miles from Ongar, which is 26 miles   
 from London.
