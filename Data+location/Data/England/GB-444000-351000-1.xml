		<title>01THE AREA</title>
		<content>   This D block contains four villages:
{Selston, Jacksdale, Westwood and      
{Bagthorpe.}The major industry in the  
 area is{coal mining.}There are 3 mines
 still operating in the immediate area 
 although only one is located in the   
 block. Other industries include       
{textiles and plastics.                
   Ouite a large proportion of the area
 is covered by farmland.{Cereal crops  
 predominate but there are{dairy farms 
 and some{poultry farming.             
   The area has changed quite a lot    
 over the years. The canal, parts of   
 the railway, the pipe works and iron  
 works have all been closed not only   
 causing loss of jobs but also derelict
 sites and subsequent 'eyesores'.      
   The area lacks major roads but is   
 criss-crossed by minor roads joining  
 the villages. However,the{M1 motorway 
 does facilitate travel north and south</content>
