		<content>{Marlow}Police station is in Dean      
 Street and it is not very big. There  
 are four shifts. In the morning all   
 the staff go into the briefing room   
 to be told what to do. Some people    
 stay in the police station and others 
 walk the streets or go in the cars to 
 see if there are any strange goings   
 on.                                   
    The Panda car is the smallest      
 vehicle and it is a Ford  Escort. In  
 the boot there are cones, brooms and  
 signs. The Panda car has a flashing   
 blue light but no siren.              
                                       
    The traffic car is a Ford Granada. 
 In the boot there are fluorescent     
 jackets, brooms, first aid kits,      
 wellington boots, blankets and cones. 
 The Police station has four cells and 
 they get the food for the inmates from
 the Two Brewers Public House.         </content>
