		<title>01Modern day Glastonbury</title>
		<content> Situated in central Somerset is the   
 delightful market town of Glastonbury.
 It is a town steeped in history and as
 such attracts many tourists.          
 Many visitors climb the 500 feet to   
 the summit of the{Tor,}and are reward-
 ed by views of the Wiltshire Downs to 
 the East, to the North are the Mendip 
 Hills, the Bristol Channel lies West  
 and South are the Polden Hills.  The  
{N.T.,}responsible for upkeep of the   
 Tor, are in the process of making     
 stepped pathways to prevent further   
 erosion.                              
{Market day}is Tuesday. Farmers bring  
 cattle and sheep to the Livestock     
 market and in the adjacent car-park   
 there is an open-air retail market.   
{Tor Fair}held annually in September is
 a centuries old tradition. Farmers    
 would bring their sheep for sale and  
 enjoy a day at the Fair.              </content>
