		<content> The first person throws a stone into  
 square 1.You then have to hop on      
 single squares and jump with two feet 
 on double squares to the top of the   
 grid and back.On the way back you pick
 up your stone in one hand and jump off
 the grid.You progress through the     
 numbers unless you touch a line with  
 your foot or hand.Each player takes a 
 turn,the winner is the first to       
 complete all ten goes.                
{Semi Circle}is a running game played  
 on a hard pitch with a marked semi    
 circle at each end.The object of the  
 game is to run from one semi to the   
 other without being had.There is one  
 person who is He,they must try to     
 catch as many people as possible.To   
 avoid being captured we often form a  
 link with each other.The person who is
 He then tries to break the chain,as   
 we must be caught one at a time.      </content>
