		<content>   At Rivenhall School,all the children
 were surveyed to find out what hobbies
 and pastimes they enjoyed.During      
 school time about half the girls      
 prefered to stay indoors at playtime. 
 The others played"Catch","Bulldog" and
 a game called "Fairytop".Almost all   
 the boys surveyed prefered to be      
 outside and play "Catch","It" and     
 "Bulldog".                            
   After school activities varied a    
 great deal.The younger girls tended to
 ride their bikes or to play with their
 dolls or friends in the park,whilst   
 the older girls prefered sports like  
 Badminton or watching television.The  
 younger boys favourite pastimes       
 included riding their bikes and       
 playing with toy cars or Scalextric.

 play tennis,snooker,football and
