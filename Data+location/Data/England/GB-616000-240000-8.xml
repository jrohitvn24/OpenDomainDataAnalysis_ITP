		<title>08OIL DEPOT, IPSWICH PORT</title>
		<content>A large area between Landseer Road and 
the River Orwell, is given over to the 
bulk storage of liquids and fuels.     
  The company currently operating the  
site is Powell Duffryn, their major    
customers being Shell and Conoco. Until
recently, most of the liquids (petrol, 
derv, heavy fuel oil and acids), were  
brought in by sea-going tankers, up    
the  River Orwell,today however,       
lorries bring in an increasing amount  
of products.The company still retain   
their private jetty along Cliff Quay.  
  As with any bulk storage depot, the  
view is not beautiful, but nevertheless
it is all you would expect of a port   
complex. It is hidden from residential 
areas by the slopes of Landseer Park.
