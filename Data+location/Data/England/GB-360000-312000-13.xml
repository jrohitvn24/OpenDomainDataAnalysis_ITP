		<content> THE PARTICULAR AREA ALLOCATED TO THE  
 SCHOOL HAS A SINGULAR LACK OF         
 AMENITIES, MAINLY BECAUSE OF ITS      
 HIGHLY AGRICULTURAL BACKGROUND.       
 THE MAIN EMPLOYERS ARE THE SUGAR-BEET 
 FACTORY, AND THE LOCAL FARMERS. MOST  
 OF THE EMPLOYEES OF THE SUGAR-BEET    
 FACTORY TRAVEL IN FROM OUTSIDE THE    
 LOCAL COMMUNITY.                      
 THERE ARE TWO DISTINCT TYPES OF       
 PERSONNAL LIVING IN THE AREA- THOSE   
 THAT HAVE LIVED IN THE AREA ALL THEIR 
 LIVES, AND WHOSE JOB HOLDS THEM TO    
 THIS AREA. THERE IS ALSO THE PEOPLE   
 WHO HAVE MOVED INTO THE AREA BECAUSE  
 OF THEIR JOBS, AND CAN AFFORD THE NEW 
 LUXURY DEVELOPMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN    
 BUILD AROUND THE OLDER VILLAGES.      
 THE ADMASTON SPA DEVELOPMENT IS A VERY
 GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS.
