 include:- (1) Highfields Farm in      
 Highfields Rd. used for housing..(2)

 house ,the fields used for houses of  
 Stevens Rd.,Cuppers Close &amp; Blunts

 St.THe house remains used as three    
 shops and the land is used for office

 an industrial estate (4)The Howbridge 
 Hall Estate had already been divided  
 up into smallholdings , probably after
