		<title>10Hellesdon's Local Residents</title>
		<content> The Joby family of Hellesdon have been
bitten by the Quiz bug.Dr.Richard Joby 
was a BBC "Mastermind" finalist and his
son Christopher is junior Mastermind.  
 They have appeared in shows such as   
"Brain of Britain",Hughie Green's quiz 
programmes,Radio Norfolk shows and a   
quiz game called "Gambit".             
 Dr.Joby is the son of an engine driver
and this has led to a deep and abiding 
interest in Railways.He has become one 
of the county's experts on the subject.
He has written many books on the       
subject.He recently gave up teaching   
at North Walsham Girl's High School    
to devote more time to his writing,    
lecturing for UEA. and holding         
tutorials for the Open University.     
His  appearance on "Mastermind" as a   
finalist caused the family a year of   
upheaval, with a great deal of travel  
and fat files of correspondance.       </content>
