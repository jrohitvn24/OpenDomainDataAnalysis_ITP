		<title>16MORTON STANLEY PARK REDDITCH</title>
		<content> It is many years ago since {Morton    
{Stanley,}a farmer, left his land for  
 the people of Redditch to enjoy. Today
 Morton Stanley Park is in a time of   
 change,and in years to come it is     
 hoped that it will be an attraction   
 for people to visit.Already there are 
 some pleasant walks,and paths around  
 the park.It is a pretty area neatly   
 set out with grasslands and woods     
 dotted about. There is a picnic area  
 with tables,and play area with swings 
 and a slide.                          
 The new plans include a nature trail  
 round coppiced and ornamental         
 woodlands as well as wildflower       
 meadows. More footpaths are also      
 proposed, and formal playing fields,  
 and a toboggan run.  When completed { 
{Morton Stanley Park}will be important 
 urban recreational land, in a fast    
 growing residential area.             </content>
