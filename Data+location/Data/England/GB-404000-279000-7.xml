		<title>07Bournville Alms Houses</title>
		<content>Bournville Alms Houses are on Maryvale 
Road. They were built in 1898 by       
{Richard Cadbury.}They are beautifully 
cared for with leaded windows and      
flowers on the window sills. The Alms  
Houses are 33 bungalows built around a 
quadrangle. They were built for old    
people whose accomodation is           
unsatisfactory but who are able to look
after themselves. People who have      
worked at{Cadbury Schweppes}and are    
aged between 60 and 80 years can apply 
for an Alms House and widows or        
widowers of Cadbury Schweppes workers  
are also considered. To apply for one  
of the bungalows they have to contact  
the{Bournville Village Trust}in Oak    
Tree Lane. There is a{warden}who is in 
charge of the well-being of the        
residents and lives in the quadrangle.
