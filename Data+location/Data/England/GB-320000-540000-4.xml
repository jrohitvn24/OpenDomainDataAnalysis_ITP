		<title>04Whitehall,Mealsgate.</title>
		<content> To the south of the house are lines of
 uneven  mounds and what may be the    
 remains of a moat,possibly Roman.There
 is a Peel Tower about sixty yards from
 the house which may have been joined  
 to the hall by a secret passage.      
   When George Moore died,Parkin Moore 
 inherited the estate,and lived there  
 until he died.Whitehall was then sold 
 and was next used as a school in the  
 1939-45 war.After the war it was used 
 as a hotel,run by a Mrs Harrison who  
 retired in 1950.It stood empty for a  
 while,and was almost pulled down for  
 scrap,but it was then bought by the   
 County Council and used as a store.In 
 1985 the stables are used as a        
 restaurant,but the rest of the house  
 stands empty. We got this information 
 from a book that was written by some  
 children who attended Allhallows      
 School in 1953.                       </content>
