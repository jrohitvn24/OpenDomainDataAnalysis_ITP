		<content> In the Langtree Parish we have got two
 chapels which are being converted into
 houses, one church, two other chapels 
 and two Sunday schools.               
 The Methodist Chapel have sevices and 
 a Sunday School every Sunday morning. 
 They have anniversary services during 
 the year and a family service every   
 month. The Minister is Rev.Breeze who 
 lives at Stibb Cross.                 
 The last resident rector of Langtree, 
 the Rev.Richard Wallington, retired in
 January 1985. The parish is now under 
 the rector of Shebbear, the Rev.Nigel 
 Mead, and services are held each      
 Sunday. There is no Sunday School at  
 present. There is a Mothers' Union    
 attached to the Church.The present    
 Church wardens are Messrs John        
 Folland and George Heath.
