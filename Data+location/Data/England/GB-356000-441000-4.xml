		<title>04B'POOL/FYLDE GLIDING CLUB</title>
		<content> Founded at Squire's Gate, Blackpool in
 1950, the Blackpool and Fylde Gliding 
 Club Ltd. purchased its present site  
 at Cock Hill Farm, Chipping,in 1973.  
 The site consists of 50 acres (the    
 grazing being let to neighbouring     
 farmers), a hangar, a clubhouse with  
 facilities for overnight stays and a  
 cottage. The club is run by           
 volunteers. 140 members from as far   
 away as Manchester, Blackpool,        
 Lancaster and Burnley,fly in 5        
 club-owned gliders(3 single-seaters, 2
 x 2 seaters used for instruction) or  
 in 1 of 18 syndicate-owned gliders.   
 Gliders are launched by means of a    
 winch and cable and are supervised    
 from a mobile control rig. Flying     
 takes place at weekends, on public    
 holidays and during several "flying   
 weeks" in the year. There is a waiting
 list for members.                     </content>
