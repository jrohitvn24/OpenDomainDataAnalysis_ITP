		<content> Good communications are vital for any 
 business and it is therefore not      
 surprising to find many warehouses and
 a new business centre next to the     
{M4 motorway}where between 900 and     
 1300 cars and lorries travel past     
 every hour , on a weekday morning .   
 The 80 acre{Windmill Hill Business    
{Park}site has as it centrepiece  a    
{windmill}brought from Chiseldon in    
 1984 and rebuilt to the condition it  
 would have been when it was contructed
 in the 1820s.                         
 To the south of this there is a group 
 of small industrial units . Also near 
 junction 16 are the headquarters of   
 the{Water Research Council}and the    
 Anchor Butter Factory but{Tempco}, who
 distribute frozen foods to            
 supermarkets , are closing their      
 Swindon warehouse in a few weeks .
