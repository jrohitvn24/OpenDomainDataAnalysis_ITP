		<title>04RAILWAY HISTORY IN GLENFIELD</title>
		<content> The{railway tunnel in Glenfield}was   
 built in 1832 as a part of the        
{Leicester and Swannington Railway,    
 engineered by George Stephenson and   
 his son Robert. At that time it was   
 the longest railway tunnel in the     
 world. The railway was built to bring 
 coal and stone to Leicester. The      
 station was sited where Stephensons   
 Court stands to_day. The first steam  
 engine on the line was called the     
 Comet. On its opening run it hit its  
 chimney on the roof of the tunnel     
 showering the passengers with smuts.  
 After the railway was closed to       
 traffic in 1964, the track was lifted,
 the tunnel was sold to Leicester City 
 Council for Â£5 and the level crossing 
 keepers cottage was knocked down. The 
 Glenfield end of the tunnel is still  
 there and the track of the line behind
 Station Rd can be walked.             </content>
