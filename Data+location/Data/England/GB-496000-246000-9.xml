		<title>09Historic Settlements</title>
		<content> Many historic settlements and features
 such as ridge and furrow have been    
 ploughed out.Such is the fate of the  
 last traces of an old settlement,     
 Dilwick, which was one of the 5 manors
 in the parish of Stagsden in 1086     
 (with Bosums, Dokesworth, Burdelys and
 Beauchamp).                           
 Ancient hedgerows may mark old        
 administrative boundaries (hundreds,  
 parishes, manors) Where current       
 boundaries are irregular there is     
 often an interesting reason.e.g. the  
 long tongue of Kempston Rural Parish  
 represents the 12th century clearance 
 of wood and waste and extension of    
 cultivation.The enlargement of a deer 
 park in the 15th century is the reason
 behind the diversion of the Stagsden  
 boundary away from the Ridgeway.This  
 perhaps also led to the demise of     
 Dilwick.                              </content>
