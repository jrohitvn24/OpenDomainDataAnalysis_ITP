		<title>14FOOD IN JERSEY</title>
		<content> We eat a lot of "junk" food.  Junk    
 food is stuff like hamburgers,        
 beefburgers, take-aways and "Wimpeys".
  We also eat a lot of frozen food     
 stuff like frozen vegetables, and we  
 eat a lot of convenience foods.  They 
 come in packets like potatoes, cakes  
 and types of pastries.  Vegetables and
 fruit come in tins and are very useful
 for old and busy people.  Convenience 
 foods, as their name suggests, are    
 very convenient for an old or single  
 person. Now more and more tinned,     
 canned, packet and frozen foods have  
 chemical colours added to them.  It   
 has been found that some colours can  
 make hyperactive children worse, and  
 some people are allergic to them.     
 Living on an island like Jersey, fresh
 produce is almost always around.      
 Jersey potatoes are the most famous   
 produce because of their sweet taste. </content>
