		<title>03FROM STONE AGE TO OUR AGE</title>
		<content> This land has been occupied for about 
 5000 years. First came the primitive  
 stone age tribes who have left us     
 their worked flints which appear when 
 the fields are ploughed - we thought  
 they were rare creatures but it seems 
 as though they occupied every south   
 facing site near water. Then in the   
 first or second century BC came the   
 tribes who worked the iron, easily    
 accessible in the clay soil.Rivers    
 and streams here run red and rusty    
 with the iron. These men made clumsy  
 iron implements and weapons - they had
 to heat the iron again and again to   
 get rid of the slag. The iron people  
 began to clear the forests and carve  
 out small damp and cold fields leaving
 trees round the edges to form         
 boundaries. Bodle Street grew up like 
 Topsy, people settling on the waste-  
 land at the boundary of two manors.   </content>
