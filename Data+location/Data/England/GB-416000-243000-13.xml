		<title>13Mickleton Gardening Club</title>
		<content> Towards the end of 1980 several       
 interested parties met in the village 
 to discuss the formation of a garden- 
 ing club.The first meeting,at which a 
 Committee was formed,was held in      
 January 1981 at the Joseph Webb Hall. 
 It was agreed to have a monthly       
 meeting on the third Wednesday at King
 George's Hall.Speakers have lectured  
 on a wide range of topics.Many        
 specialists have spoken about their   
 particular interests,and amateurs have
 shown slides of their own beautiful   
 gardens and spurred members to greater
 efforts when dealing with their own   
 gardens.COACH OUTINGS to Stately      
 Homes,Botanical Gardens,Arboretums and
 Garden Centres are organised.The main 
 event of the year is the FLOWER AND   
 PRODUCE SHOW in September.            
 The MEMBERSHIP in July 1985 is 235.
