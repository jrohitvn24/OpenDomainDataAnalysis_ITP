		<content>  The principal form of farming in our 
area is market gardening. A large      
proportion of the land is given over to
horticulture.                          
  My uncle Ian is a nurseryman in      
Longton.His land covers one hectare    
and he has six large greenhouses.      
   His chief crops are lettuce,        
which is grown throughout the year,    
and tomato and celery,which are        
seasonal.                              
     On his land he uses an organic    
based liquid compound fertiliser.He    
needs to use machinary such as a       
tractor,a rotavator,and a planting     
machine and tomato grader as well as   
good old-fashioned muscle power.       
 Because the land round here is liable 
to flooding he uses irrigation         
equipment too.His produce is taken to  
markets as far apart as Glasgow and    
Wolverhampton.    (Alison Greenwood)   </content>
