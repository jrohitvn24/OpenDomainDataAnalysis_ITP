		<content> Earley Farm is a very old farm,       
 probably built before 1066.It has a   
 brick floor in the kitchen laid on    
 sand.It has plenty of fields around it
 for all the cows,sheep and crops that 
 the owner has.The farm does not       
 specialise in any particular type of  
 farming so it is a mixed farm.The     
 farmer breeds cows for milk and cattle
 for beef.The cows produce 1000 gallons
 of milk annually. The farmer breeds   
 pure Freesian heifers for milking     
 cows.He cross breeds them sometimes   
 with his Hereford bull to poduce beef 
 calves to sell them to another farmer 
 for fattening,then they are sold at   
 Heathfield market.The farmer also     
 breeds sheep.He has around 220 Kent   
 ewes and 5 Dorset Down rams.In        
 1985,200 lambs were born which was    
 less than normal because of the hard  
 winter.                               </content>
