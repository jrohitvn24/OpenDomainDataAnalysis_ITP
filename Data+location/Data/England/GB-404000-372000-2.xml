 There has been a church on the site   
 for over seven hundred years, but the 
 building we see today mainly dates    
 from 1839, when the nave and the tower
 were built. In 1897 a porch was built 
 onto the southern entrance. In 1902   
 the transepts, chancel and vestry were
 added. Until February 1951 the church 
 was lit by gas. There are six stained 
 glass windows in the church - one of  
 them features a biplane.              
{Fairfield Low,}at 367 metres the      
 highest point in Fairfield,is an      
 ancient burial mound. Today it is     
 marked by a clump of trees.           
                                       
{Other Listed Buildings}in Fairfield   
 include the Vicarage, Hawthorn Farm,  
 Old Hall Cottages, and Cherry Tree    
 Farmhouse.
