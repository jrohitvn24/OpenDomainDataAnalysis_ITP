		<title>11Children's Games-Marbles</title>

 I have got 262 marbles of different   
 colours, sizes and types. I like to   
 play marbles and swap marbles. You can
 have different names for marbles, such
 as chinas, glasses, bottlewashers,    
 ballbearings, peewis, pearlies, french
 chinas and kingfishers.               
 You play marbles by rolling your      
 marble along the floor or playground. 
 Then the next person rolls their      
 marble and tries to hit the other     
 marble. If he or she does, then they  
 win that marble.                      
 Sometimes we swap marbles. Two glass  
 ones are worth one china one. But if  
 you swap marbles watch out for the    
 trickc, because some people take the  
 tops of roll-on deodorant bottles and 
 try to swap them.
