		<content> Our area is mainly farmland but       
 also contains a large 16th century    
 farmhouse. There is also part of      
{Purston Jaglin,}the main town, but    
 the part we are concerned with is     
 Featherstone.                         
   In Featherstone there is an old     
 people's home and some old people's   
 bungalows.{Featherstone}is a typical  
 Yorkshire town and lots of people     
 suffered hardship during the miners   
 strike which took place in Britain    
 during 1984_85.                       
   There is also an adventure          
 playground surrounded by the old      
 peoples bungalows and Council houses. 
 From here you can see the old sewage  
 works which was converted into an     
 electrical pump in 1981 and this pumps
 straight through to Normanton         
 pumping station.
