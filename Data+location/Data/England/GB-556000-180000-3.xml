		<content> Essex county council have given their 
 thumbs down on the new plans to build 
 a 5000-unit housing estate on         
 protected greenbelt land at           
 Bulphan.This decision occured at a    
 council meeting on friday july 5th.   
     A group of builders wanted to     
 spend Â£300,000000 or more on the      
 project.Leader of the local opposition
 campaign Mr Keith Derry said "I am    
 pleased that the plan has been        
 defeated, greenbelt land must be      
 protected.If this plan had succeeded  
 then this could have been the start of
 the erosion of greenbelt land in the  
 UK.                                   
     This decision hopefully means that
 housing development will in future    
 take place in the West Thurrock area  
 where most people think it is most    
 needed.
