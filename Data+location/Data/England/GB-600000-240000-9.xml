		<title>09The Schools in Hadleigh</title>
		<content>Our School used to be in Threadneedle  
St. and these buildings were the       
secondary school,but a new upper school
was built and we moved here.In fact the
system was going to be changed and the 
new school was to be a middle school,  
our school becoming a first school.The 
plans were changed but both schools    
have suffered ever since with inappro- 
priate equipment.These buildings are   
completely unsuited to very young      
children and even with the older ones  
we have trouble with all the huts.At   
least we have quite a lot of room and  
some large fields.We take children aged
from 5 to 11yrs.,the High School from  
11 to 16yrs.then they go to the Upper  
School in Sudbury.There is also a      
church-linked Primary School in        
Hadleigh - St.Mary's.
