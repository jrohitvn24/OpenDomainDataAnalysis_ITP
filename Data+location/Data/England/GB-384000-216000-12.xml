		<content> When assembly is finished we go back  
 to class and carry on with our work.At
 10.40 we go out for playtime.I usually
 play football.We come back in at      
 11.00. We keep going on with our work 
 until 12.30.We leave the classroom and
 line up for dinner.I have sandwiches. 
 It takes me quarter of an hour to eat 
 my dinner.I then go out and play      
 football.We come in when the whistle  
 goes again.We start our work.We keep  
 going all afternoon until 3.15 when it
 is time to go home.When I get home I  
 get changed and do my homework.We then
 have tea.I play for an hour and a half
 until bath and bedtime.
