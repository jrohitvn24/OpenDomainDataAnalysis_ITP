		<content> As part of the preparations for the   
 school's Centenary Year contact was   
 made with many ex-scholars,some of    
 whom still live locally.They had many 
 tales to tell of Leigh Sinton village 
 in the past.The oldest ex-pupil we    
 traced was 91 year old Miss Annie Ball
 who vividly remembered receiving the  
 prize she showed us.Her memories of   
 Mr.F.Wareham, the Headmaster from 1894
 -1931 were matched by another ex-pupil
 who can remember hiding and burning   
 the cane of the headmaster and boasted
 of his feat at Centenary Day.In a     
 photograph of 1907 Miss Ball is       
 pictured standing next to the mother  
 of our present day wheelwright,Gerald 
 Jones,who is a mine of information    
 regarding the village.A famous village
 character who died 3 years ago is to  
 be remembered by the provision of o   
 seat for the children of the school.  </content>
