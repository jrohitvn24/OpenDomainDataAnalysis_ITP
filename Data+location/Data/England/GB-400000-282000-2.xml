		<content>Weoley Castle-ruins of possibly oldest 
building in Birmingham. A fortified    
manor house, not a true castle, it had 
no keep. Mainly built after the Norman 
Conquest but with Saxon origins. Name  
comes from Saxon Â£WEOH-LEAH', a wood   
in which there is a temple. Three known
buildings on the site. Final building  
consisted of main entrance,  chapel,   
guest house, great hall, kitchen etc,  
surrounded by moat. Site inhabited for 
500 years, a ruin by the 17th century. 
In care of local authority. Open to    
public. Place name derivations include 
naming of city suburb, two schools -   
Paganel &amp; Jervoise. Bottetourt, Somery 
&amp; Burnel Roads were named after owners 
of the castle. The Â£Stonehouse', oldest
inhabited building in district, once a 
farmhouse built with stone from castle 
ruins. Farmland now part of Weoley     
Castle Council Estate.                 </content>
