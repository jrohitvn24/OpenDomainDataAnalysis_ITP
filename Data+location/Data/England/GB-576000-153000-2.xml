		<title>02STONE STREET, MAIDSTONE</title>
		<content>   Stone Street is the Maidstone end of
 the Hastings Road running south up the
 side of the Len Valley from the bottom
 of Gabriel's Hill. Since the demise of
 trolleybuses nearly 20 years ago it   
 has been{one-way}southwards. There are
 no long-term on-street parking spaces 
 although pay-and-display{car parks}can
 be found nearby.                      
   The nature and range of the street's
 service outlets typify those of a road
 leading from a main town centre: in   
 North America it would be called an{  
{auto-row.}Fairly new car showrooms mix
 with dilapidated housing converted to 
 retail use. There are many servicing{ 
{garages}ranging from self-drive hire  
 to exhaust replacement centres. There 
 are also many take-away{hot food      
{shops,}from fish-and-chips to Tandoori
 take-away, and six public houses.
