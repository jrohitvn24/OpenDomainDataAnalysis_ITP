		<content>   The only shop in Stoke Albany is the
post office. It is a general grocery   
store. Mrs. Bellamy has lived there all
her life and is to receive the Member  
of the British Empire medal this year  
for service to the village. The post   
office has been in her family for      
hundreds of years. The post office was 
expanded 38 years ago. It has posters  
in the window to tell people things    
that are happening such as Stoke Feast,
an annual fete which takes place on the
village green. In 1966 the village     
school closed down. It is now the      
village hall. The Brownies meet there  
at 6.30pm on Tuesdays. Children of     
primary school age go to school in     
Wilbarston and older children go to    
school in Rothwell or Kettering. On a  
Thursday the old people are taken by   
car to Marlow House Day Care Centre in 
Desborough.                            </content>
