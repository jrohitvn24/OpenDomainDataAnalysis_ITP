		<content>  We found that the majority of people 
in our survey travelled less than 10   
miles to work,but a few travelled      
between 20-50 miles a day,because there
was nothing more suitable nearer home. 
Most of these people needed some form  
of special training for their present  
job.A few people worked short hours or 
did part time work,but most people who 
were working did a long,full day.      
  Quite a few people had experienced   
unemployment at some time in their     
lives,but the lenght of time they were 
unemployed varied between 6 weeks and 3
years.                                 
  We were interested to find that about
20% of those asked began work at less  
than 14years of age.About 10% began    
work at 21 years or older,but the      
majority began work when aged between  
15 and 18 years.
