		<title>15WARE WEEK</title>
		<content> On Saturday,8th June there was a {    
{pavement artists competition.}The     
 mayor and mayoress were the judges and
 the mayor gave all those who entered a
 Mars bar.Forty two children entered.I 
 didn't win but I enjoyed my Mars bar. 
 On 9th June my mum,my brother and I   
 went to the{Ware Week Dog Show.}We    
 came first in the 'Dog the Judge would
 like to take home' contest,second in  
 'chld handling' and fourth in the     
 'Oldest Dog'.                         
 There was a fete there with a cake    
 stall,toy stall and a table with all  
 the rosettes.I would have enjoyed the 
 Dog Show even more if it had not been 
 raining.
