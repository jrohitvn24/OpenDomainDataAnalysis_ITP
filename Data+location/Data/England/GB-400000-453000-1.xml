		<content> Embsay with Eastby is a township in   
 the parish of Skipton in the craven   
 district of the county of North       
 Yorkshire.  Spared from large scale   
 housing or industrial development, the
 parish is situated between the grouse 
 moors of Barden to the North and the  
 limestone Bank of Haw park to the     
 South.  The rocky outcrop of Embsay   
 Cra stands out from the Moor to the   
 West.  A similar outcrop, Eatby Crag, 
 is set above the village to the East. 
 The road through the village is the   
 boundary of the National Park and     
 leads in the direction of Barden to a 
 height of about 340 metres at park    
 top.  A mill producing synthetic      
 fibre, a tannery and a quarry provide 
 local employment outside agriculture. 
 Sheep and cattle graze the moors and  
 farms are predominantly concerned with
 rearing livestock.                    </content>
