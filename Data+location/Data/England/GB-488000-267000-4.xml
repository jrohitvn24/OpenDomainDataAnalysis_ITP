		<content> 1As part of a PRE-'A' LEVEL course in 
 the last three weeks of term,a number 
 of pupils looked at the spatial       
 variation in the cost of a {BASKET OF 
 GOODS.Nine retail outlets were sampled
 and for each,a list of every-day goods
 was drawn up.Each outlet was visited  
 by a sixth former and the total cost  
 was ascertained with the help of the  
 shopkeeper.The distance of each outlet
 was then measured from the centre of  
 the town and then this variable was   
 graphed against the total cost of each
 basket of goods.Once the graphical    
 exercise had been carried out,an      
 appropriate statistical test,SPEARMAN 
 RANK CORRELATION COEFFICIENT, was     
 used.This revealed that the overall   
 cost of shopping goods does in fact   
 vary quite considerably with not only 
 the distance from the centre of       
 town,but also the size of the function</content>
