		<title>11LOCAL ISSUES</title>
		<content>  The following issues are of great    
 concern to many of the local residents
{Second Homes:}This area is frequently 
 chosen by people who want to buy a 2nd
 home.As many as{16%}are 2nd homes.    
 People seek the tranquillity,         
 invigorating weather, close proximity 
 to the sea, the character of the old_ 
 fashioned market town of{Southwold}and
 the heritage coastline which is a good
 area for walking and Botany.This      
 creates many problems and, although it
 generates business, it inflates house 
 prices, making it more difficult for  
 local people to buy homes,and drives  
 young people away from the area. The  
 lack of low_cost housing thus caused, 
 means that many people employed       
 here have to live outside the area,   
 wasting money on transport. It also   
 discourages people from working in the
 area as costs of transport are high.  </content>
