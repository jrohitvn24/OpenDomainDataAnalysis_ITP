		<title>17FAIR OAK BUSINESS CONCERNS</title>
		<content>    Fair Oak has no industry. The      
 largest businesses are a Transport/   
 Tipper hire company which also        
 supplies gravels and soils and also   
 the sandpit which is still being      
 worked and has recently opened a sales
 section for building materials. Four  
 garages provide petrol services and   
 car sales. Many small businesses are  
 run only by the owners from private   
 homes and employ only two or three    
 people. Most of the businesses offer a
 service such as plumbing, heating,    
 electrical work, decorating, building 
 and domestic repairs.                 
    Unusual businesses also run from   
 private homes include a Funeral       
 Director, Precision Engineering,      
 Removals, Fencing, Pottery, Printing  
 and a small nursery selling fruit,    
 flowers and vegetables as well as a   
 comprehensive range of saddlery.      </content>
