		<content> The survey area is composed almost    
 entirely of agricultural land,farmed  
 for arable crops and the two villages 
 of Barkston Ash and Church Fenton.    
{ Barkston Ash}is a nucleated village  
 that has grown around farms.It is     
 surrounded by Barley fields and is    
 predominantly Catholic.Very little    
 employment in the village means most  
 people cmmute to Tadcaster,Leeds or   
 York to work.                         
{ Church Fenton}is a linear village    
 strung between the station to the west
 and the RAF base to the east.Most     
 villagers work in farming or commute  
 to Tad.Leeds or York.Peoples' main    
 complaint is noise from the RAF but do
 recognise its role as a local employer
  Villagers living in both places      
 complained about the lack of          
 facilities rural areas experienced.
