		<title>01A COTSWOLD VILLAGE</title>
		<content>{ Sherston}is a medium sized village   
 about 5 miles to the south west of    
 Malmesbury towards the southern end of
 the{Cotswold Hills.}Many of its older 
 houses and the walls surrounding many 
 of the fields are built of pale       
 Jurassic limestone and the roofs are  
 made of the heavy Cotswold tiles.     
  A remnant of the early wool and      
 weaving{industry}typical of the area  
 is a small factory producing lingerie 
 elastic, whilst building, transport   
 and agricultural engineering firms    
 serve the needs of a quite extensive  
 area.{Retailing}of meat,wine, cider   
 and spiced condiments are developing  
 the agricultural tradition, whilst an 
 educational software company shows the
 village to be no sleepy backwater.    
  Over 100 new houses since 1970 have  
 brought to the village newcomers who  
 commute to work.                      </content>
