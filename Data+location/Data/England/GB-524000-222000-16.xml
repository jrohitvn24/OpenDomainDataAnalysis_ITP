		<title>16Population Growth</title>
		<content>   The population of Stevenage is      
 growing faster than the average for   
 England and Wales. This is because as 
 a new town it has a young population. 
 Stevenage has a big housing problem   
 because the younger people are getting
 married and need houses. To provide   
 extra houses, new areas are being     
 built. One of these is called Poplars,
 providing homes for 3500 people.      
   We spoke to some people who live in 
 Poplars and they said that the houses 
 are pleasant but the gardens are      
 small. At the moment it is very muddy 
 and the pavements are uneven, the     
 houses are modern but crammed         
 together. Poplars is very quiet       
 because there is not much traffic and 
 not too many people have moved in yet.
