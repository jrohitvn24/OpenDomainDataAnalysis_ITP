		<title>02BEMPTON'S SEA BIRDS</title>
		<content>      At the extreme north-east corner 
 of the sector are the{chalk cliffs, } 
 these constitute the main feature of  
 the area as far as ecology is         
 concerned. The cliffs rise to over    
 four hundred feet in places. As well  
 as attracting many visitors who come  
 to admire the spectacular scenery, the
 cliffs are home for many thousands of 
 sea birds including {gannets}         
 ,razor-bills,puffins and guillemots.  
      The gannets draw tens of         
 thousands of visitors to the area each
 Spring and Summer because this is the 
 only mainland colony in England.      
 Although most of the land is privately
 owned, the {R.S.P.B.}do have a reserve
 there which is manned by a warden for 
 part of the year.
