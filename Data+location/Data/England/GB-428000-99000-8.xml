		<content>   The main features of transport are  
 the London to Bournemouth and Weymouth
 railway line with its branch to       
 Lymington for the Isle of Wight ferry 
 and the A337 road which leads from the
 M27 at Cadnam to Lymington. This road 
 carries much of the private and       
 commercial traffic for the western    
 part of the Isle of Wight. The railway
 line to Ringwood, Wimborne and        
 Bournemouth West was closed in 1964   
 and subsequently dismantled.          
   Nearly every house in this area has 
 at least one motor car and this is a  
 reason for the fact that many people, 
 who live in this region, travel daily 
 to work elsewhere. A major traffic    
 problem is the railway level crossing 
 at Brockenhurst station which can     
 cause long 'tailbacks' on the A337    
 when the barrier is down in           
 summertime.                           </content>
