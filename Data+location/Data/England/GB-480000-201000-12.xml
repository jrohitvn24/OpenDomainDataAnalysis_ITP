		<title>12PRINCES RISBOROUGH BY-PASS</title>
		<content>Before the By-Pass of Princes          
Risborough the main road ran through   
the very narrow, High Street, and this 
meant that cars were rushing through   
the High Street where all the shops and
Pedestrians were.                      
The Road Scheme was though of about 30 
years ago but was only started just    
over a year ago.                       
When the by-pass was finished, the     
traffic coming from the north or south 
would have to go through two           
roundabouts, and go round the back of  
the high street.                       
This has greatly cut down the traffic  
congestion through the high street.    
The main Shops have also been moved    
from the high street, elsewhere so now 
very little traffic comes through for  
the shops that are in the High Street.
