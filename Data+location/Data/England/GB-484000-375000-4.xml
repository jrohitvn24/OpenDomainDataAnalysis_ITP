		<title>04Life in Kettlethorpe/Fenton</title>
		<content> The occupations of those living in    
 Fenton and Kettlethorpe are evenly    
 divided by those working locally,     
 those who work in nearby towns or even
 further afield and those who are      
 retired. There are several families   
 whose parents have come from the      
 surrounding areas, but there are an   
 increasing number with no family      
 connections nearby. There is no       
 natural gas in the area, so heating   
 and cooking is done by electricity,   
 solid fuel, oil or propane gas. Tanker
 lorries and the coal man are common   
 sights. Televisions, radios, fridges  
 and washing machines are to be found  
 in almost all homes with an increasing
 number of freezers. Families feel     
 a car is essential for work, shopping 
 and the children's activities. Most   
 people shop in Gainsborough or Lincoln
 but many also use the mobile shops.   </content>
