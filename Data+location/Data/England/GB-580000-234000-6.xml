		<title>06     Farm Machinery</title>
		<content> Mechanisation on the farm is now      
 indispensible to the farmer aiding    
 productivity by its efficient usage,  
 at the same time representing high    
 capital cost in place of reduced      
 labour costs.The tractor is regarded  
 as the generel purpose vehicle.On     
 the 4 farms surveyed,there were Ford  
 (13),Massey Ferguson(12)and           
 International Harvester(1).Total 26.  
 Parks Farm has one tractor per 104    
 acres,Chelmshoe one tractor per 92    
 acres and Lucking and Moat Farms one  
 per 76 acres.The farms keep their     
 tractors between 6 and 11 years.Each  
 farm has its own Combine Harvester,   
 ranging from 80 to 200+ horsepower.

 harvester, a Bobcat steer loader and
