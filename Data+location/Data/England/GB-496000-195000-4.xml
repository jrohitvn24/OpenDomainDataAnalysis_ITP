		<content> A man, aged 75, died in a car crash in
 April. He was driving up Stanley Hill,
 when it is thought he had a heart     
 attack. He veered off the road and    
 crashed through a fence. The woman    
 passenger survived without any        
 injuries.  There was also a dog in the
 back which suffered from shock. The   
 crash was at about 2.45.It was very   
 near the time when the pupils of St.  
 George's School would be leaving.     
 Luckily no other pedestrians were     
 involved.                             
 Two students from Amersham College    
 have been chosen to speak in the Young
 Speaker of the Year Competition       
 organized by the English Speaking     
 Union to mark International Youth     
 Year.The best six speakers will go    
 before a panel of judges in November. 
 A trophy and scholarship will be      
 awarded to the winner.                </content>
