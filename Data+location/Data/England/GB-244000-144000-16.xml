		<content>     The Parish of Mortehoe extends to 
 the borders of the village of Lee to  
 the North, West Down to the East, and 
 Georgeham to the South, with the      
 Atlantic Ocean to the West, and       
 incorporates the busy holiday resort  
 of Woolacombe.  It is governed by a   
 three-tier local government system. At
 grass roots, the Parish Council of 9  
 elected members, who meet once a      
 month, act as watchdogs for the next  
 tier, the District Council, in        
 advising on planning applications,    
 licencing, maintaining public         
 footpaths, etc.  They may strike up to
 a 5p rate, but owing to revenue from  
 the car park and putting green, have  
 only this year levied a 1p rate, the  
 first for many years.  Mortehoe send  
 one elected member to North Devon     
 District Council, the chief planning  
 and licencing authority in the area.  </content>
