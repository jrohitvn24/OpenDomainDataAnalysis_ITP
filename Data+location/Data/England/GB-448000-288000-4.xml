		<title>04EDUCATION IN CLAYBROOKE 1</title>
		<content>  Claybrooke Primary School (first     
 built in 1813) caters for children in 
 the two Claybrookes,Wibtoft, High     
 Cross and Bittesby. Until 1976        
 children from Ullesthorpe (aged 8yrs) 
 were transfered to Claybrooke School. 
 However they have their own primary   
 school(5-11). Frolesworth village     
 school has long been demolished and   
 the few children travel to a Broughton
 Astley primary school.                
  At Claybrooke Primary School there   
 are 76 pupils on roll and 4 teachers. 
 They commence school at 5yrs and at 11
 they transfer to the Lutterworth High 
 School until they are 14yrs; then they
 continue their education at           
 Lutterworth Grammar(Upper) School     
 until 16 or 18yrs of age.             
 This is the Leicestershire Plan       
 Comprehensive System.
