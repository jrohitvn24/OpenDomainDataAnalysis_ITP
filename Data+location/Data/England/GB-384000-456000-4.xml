		<title>04Hellifield Parish Council</title>
		<content>    The Parish Council consists of     
 seven members elected by the villagers
 every four years. The Chairman is     
 elected by the Councillors annually.  
    The earliest records of meetings of
 the Council go back to 1908.          
    Meetings take place in the Village 
 Institute on the first Tuesday in the 
 month at 7.30pm. The first half hour  
 is put aside to allow villagers to ask
 questions, make requests, offer       
 suggestions, and to put complaints.   
    The Council is responsible for the 
 allotments, playing areas, street     
 lighting and the tidiness of the      
 village.                              
    A present project is to finance an 
 improvement in street lighting at an  
 estimated cost of Â£10,000 to Â£13,000. 
    A proposal to bipass the village at
 some future date is on display in the 
 Post Office.                          </content>
