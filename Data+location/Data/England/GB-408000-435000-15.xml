		<content>  Florida Road estate is quite a new   
 one and so is the one round Grasleigh 
 Way. Above the crossroads there are   
 three very new houses which have just 
 been built.                           
  In the village there is a Public     
 House called the Victoria Hotel, a    
 newsagents and a post office, a chapel
 and a butchers, a bakers, an off_     
 licence, a shop that sells shoes and  
 clothes and a fish 'n' chip shop.     
  Down the road the mill has been      
 converted into five different works.  
 There is a printers, a firm that makes
 windows, a car customising centre, a  
 carton factory, and a clothes         
 warehouse.                            
  Further down there is a Garden Centre
 and a turf place.                     
  Most people work in the cities of    
 Bradford and Leeds, but not in the    
 village.                              </content>
