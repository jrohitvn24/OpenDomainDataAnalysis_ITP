		<title>15OLD AGE PENSIONERS.</title>
		<content> Old age pensioners usually retire     
 between the ages of 60 and 65.when you
 are a pensioner you get paid a certain
 amount of money by the government.    
          When people are over the age 
 of working they should be allowed to  
 take it easy.You are paid different   
 amounts of money depending on the job 
 you did and if you are married.Often  
 people get paid extra money by the    
 company they worked for.              
 We have found that there are more     
 grandmothers than grandfathers of     
 children in the First Year.This may be
 because of the Second World War or    
 perhaps ladies live longer than men.  
 The council build special homes for   
 pensioners.
