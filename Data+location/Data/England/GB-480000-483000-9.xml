{North York Moors,}which makes it a    
 popular place for many tourists.There 
 are many famous and historical places 
 to visit: The Thatched Cottage,The    
 Stone Crosses on the Moors and the    
 beautiful scenery.Thornton has long   
 been called the prettiest village in  
 Yorkshire.{The Thatched Cottage}is one
 of the most photographed buildings of 
 Thornton.It stands on the bank of the 
 beck. With a small beck running       
 through the centre of the village,    
 visitors enjoy the chance to feed the 
 ducks. Another great attraction is the
 village stocks, although the original 
 ones have now been replaced. People   
 stay in many holiday cottages. At     
 present, most tourists come in August.
