		<content> There is only one school in the survey
 area, Loddiswell Primary School. This 
 school of just under 80 children takes
 children from rising 5's to 11yrs from
 most of the area. Primary age children
 from The Mounts attend East Allington 
 School.                               
 Children of secondary age, from 11-18,
 travel by school bus to Kingsbridge   
 Comprehensive School.                 
 Loddiswell Primary School has three   
 classrooms, two in the main building, 
 built in the middle of the 19th       
 century, and the other in a wooden    
 classroom erected 30 years ago. There 
 is no school hall and meals are cooked
 on the premises and served in the     
 classroom. The cost of a school meal  
 in September 1985 is 60p. About 40    
 children have school meals, but many  
 now bring packed lunches. Very few    
 children go home at lunchtime.        </content>
