		<content>   Down St Mary is a small village     
 surrounded by countryside. There are  
 many roads leading to it, the main one
 winding up from Morchard Road. In Down
 St Mary there is a church and a Post  
 Office  which also sells a few        
 foods. There is a bus shelter and     
 village hall. In the centre of the    
 village is a green. There are         
 numerous fields around with several   
 woods. Down the hill from Down St Mary
 there is another village called       
 Morchard Road. That has a pub and a   
 garage which sells food as well. It   
 lies on the main road from Exeter to  
 Barnstaple where the road to          
 Torrington turns off. There is also a 
 road to Morchard Bishop.  There is an 
 unmanned railway station at Morchard  
 Road.  Several ancient farms have     
 survived in the area.
