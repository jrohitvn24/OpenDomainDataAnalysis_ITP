		<title>15Ecology of Yewdale 1</title>
		<content>    The{climate}of the area is largely 
 governed by its position at the       
 mountainous head of a long valley     
 which opens to the sea. {Rainfall     
 steadily increases from 889 mm at the 
 coast to 2794 mm at nearby Great      
 Langdale. As the soil is thin, and the
 rocks impervious, there is a rapid    
 run-off and temporary floods can      
 occur. The winter months have heavy   
 rainfall, but August is the month of  
 the secondary maximum - a fact often  
 forgotten by tourists !               
   {Snow}is not a major problem in the 
 valleys, and these are often clear    
 when there is a great deal of snow on 
 the fell tops.{Daytime temperatures   
 range from about 15C in July to about 
 3C in January in the valleys.{Aspect  
 has a considerable effect on          
 temperature, and thus many farms are  
 sited on south-facing slopes.         </content>
