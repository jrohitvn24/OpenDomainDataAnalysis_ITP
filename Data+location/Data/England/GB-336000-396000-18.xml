		<title>18HOW I SPEND MY SATURDAYS</title>
		<content> I wake later than usual because there 
 is no school. I help mum with the     
 shopping in the morning, come home for
 dinner, then watch the afternoon film 
 on television. At 5.30 I get a shower 
 or bath ready to go out, and change   
 into something smart. Sometimes I wear
 make-up dependning on what mood I'm   
 in. I call for my friend and at 7.00  
 we go to the{Youth Club}where there   
 are 3 rooms. The Snooker Room has both
 snooker and table tennis tables and a 
 place to buy drinks and crisps. In the
 Hall we can play badminton, and in the
 Dark Room (very popular) we sit around
 listening to music. We pay 20 pence to
 get in the Youth Club which closes at 
 10.00 and we get the bus home.        
 Children from 12 to 19 attend and if  
 we behave ourselves we may have a     
 disco. Anyone found swearing is banned
 for a week.    Joanne Morris aged 14. </content>
