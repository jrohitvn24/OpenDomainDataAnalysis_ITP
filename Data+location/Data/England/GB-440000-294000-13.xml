		<title>13FAMILY LIFE</title>
		<content> My mum and my sister play tennis while
 me and my dad go train spotting. I    
 have been train spotting ever since I 
 was five. My sister has won a lot of  
 trophies because she is a good tennis 
 player. I have got four people in my  
 family and I have got two pets, a     
 tortoise and a hamster. My favourite  
 occupation is train spotting. I like  
 living in Hinckley. My favourite pop  
 group is the Thompson Twins. I am     
 nine years old. I leave the house to  
 go to school and to go to my nanny's  
 and to play with my friends. My house 
 is twelve years old. If I had a       
 chance to change the world I would get
 rid of school and I would make        
 everything you buy free. My favourite 
 food is chicken. My family like       
 playing cricket together. My dad works
 at Fludes and my mum works at St.     
 Mary's school.                        </content>
