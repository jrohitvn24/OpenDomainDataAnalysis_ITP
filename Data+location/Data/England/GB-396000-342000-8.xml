		<content>   Unfortunately since the boundary    
changes of 1974-5 when the S.M.D.C.    
took over fromm the Cheadle Rural      
District Council, the centre has had to
pay rates, unlike some of it's         
counterparts in neighbouring districts.
   Nevertheless the committee of       
trustees themselves in conjunction with
others, like the M.S.C. Schemes,it has 
run over last few years has helped not 
only  the Centre and Parish of Dilhorne
but has found employment for many      
people in the area.                    
   Now in conjunction with the         
Standing Conferece of Voluntary Social 
Work Organisations in Staffordshire    
Community Programme, not onlyu work in 
tCentre and Parish is been carried out 
throughout the area of the South       
Moorlands, for the elderly and disabled
in need. There is a computer club. All 
facilities are open to the public.     </content>
