 area of Horton,but not much recent    
 housing development.There are just    
 some farms,shops,houses and two       
 churches.In Horton and Sodbury a few  
 buildings are being renovated because 
 they are crumbling away.One of the    
 buildings that  has been renovated in 
 Horton used to be the old potting     
 sheds for Horton Hall.The oldest house
 in Horton was built in the 14th       
 century and has got a thatched roof.  
 There are two main business buildings 
 in the area. One of them is a company 
 called PAFEC which has taken over     
 Horton Hall.The other sells farming   
 equipment and is called Bill Bennet   
 Engineering.This is a new building.   
 There are two other buildings one is a
 social club which has not been built  
 long and an old wooden village hall.
