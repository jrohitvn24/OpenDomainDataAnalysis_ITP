		<content>Bantock House was built in the mid 18th
Century.It was first called New        
Merridale Farm,then Merridale House and
finally Bantock House as it is known   
to-day.In 1866 Mr.Thomas Bantock farmed
there.He had 10 children and 6         
servants.When Thomas died,his son,     
Albert Baldwin Bantock,took over and   
lived there with his wife and servants.
He had no children.Albert liked        
collecting.He also served on the       
council and later became Mayor.When he 
died he left the house,grounds and     
collection to the town.This collection 
has since been improved by donations   
from other people.The museum houses    
collections of enamels,Japanning,      
crockery,dolls and toys.Another part of
the building is used as a district     
library.The grounds include a child's  
playground and a miniature golf        
course.                                </content>
