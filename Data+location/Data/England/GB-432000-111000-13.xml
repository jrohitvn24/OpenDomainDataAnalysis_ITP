		<title>13A DAY IN THE LIFE OF MARC</title>
		<content> My name is Marc Wilcox and I am       
 thirteen years old. I am a pupil of   
 Hounsdown School. I get up at 7.3O in 
 the morning and get dressed. At 8.OO  
 a.m. I leave home to catch the bus to 
 school. The bus arrives at 8.1O a.m.  
 and it takes about twenty minutes to  
 get to school. At 8.45 a.m.is         
 registration and at 9.OO a.m.         
 Geography starts. It ends at 1O.15    
 a.m. and is followed by Maths. At     
 11.3O a.m. is a fifteen minute break  
 after which is French until lunchtime 
 at 12.55. p.m.                        
 After lunch which lasts until 2.O5    
 p.m. the last lesson of the day is    
 Chemistry which goes on until 3.15    
 p.m. Then I catch the bus home and    
 arrive at about 3.4O p.m. I get       
 changed and do my paper round, have   
 tea, do my homework and then go out   
 until 9.15.p.m. Then I go to bed!     </content>
