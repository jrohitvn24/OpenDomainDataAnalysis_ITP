		<title>12A DAY IN MY LIFE.</title>
		<content> I am Richard Kilner,aged 9.Each       
 morning I dress,have breakfast of Rice
 Krispies with hot milk,and set off for
 school.After assembly we do maths.We  
 can work as fast as we like.After play
 we do reading workshop,which I hate   
 most of all,followed by recorder      
 practice.At 12 o'clock it is dinner   
 time.Today I had salad,ham and baked  
 potatoes with shortbread cake and     
 custard for pudding.After dinner I    
 went to the swimming baths at         
 Royston,then back to school for an art
 lesson,before playing football.When   
 school is over I do my piano practice 
 and play snooker with my dad.Following
 tea I watch television.When I get     
 tired I have a bath and go to bed.    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
