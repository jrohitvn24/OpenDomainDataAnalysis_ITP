		<title>12FARMING MACHINERY(CHEMICALS)</title>
		<content> On the large farm which specialises in
 malting barley,quality rather than    
 quantity is the priority and fewer    
 sprays are used than on the smaller   
 farm which is geared to high yields.  
 Less nitrogen is used on barley for   
 malting than for feed.Hence the larger
 farm has fewer machines.The smaller   
 farm's machinery is all geared to a 16
 metre tramline;the lack of seeds along
 these lines shows the way for all the 
 machinery thus avoiding damage to the 
 crop.Machines are high so that the    
 cereal can be sprayed with fungicide  
 against mildew and ear diseases; a    
 growth regulator keeps the straw      
 short so easier to bale.The sprayer   
 with its folded arms in the barn      
 resembled a locust! Weeds are         
 eradicated before ploughing, harrowing
 and drilling.The new combine harvester
 cost Â£50,000.                         </content>
