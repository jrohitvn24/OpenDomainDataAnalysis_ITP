		<content>The world's airlines fly overhead in   
great numbers.Northbound civilian air- 
craft from Heathrow commonly fly over  
our block between 09.00 and 10.30 hrs. 
They are bound for the U.S.A. and      
Canada.They are using a route called   
Amber One East and are at altitudes of 
about 8000 feet.                       
Southbound traffic,or its condensation 
trails,can be seen at 08.00 to 09.30   
hrs.,and again in the late afternoon or
evening.These planes pass over our     
block at  about 12,000 feet and are    
descending to the stacking stations of 
Bovingdon or Stapleford Tawney.These   
planes use a route called Amber One    
West.The 2 routes together are known   
officially as the Daventry by- pass.The
reason for the high concentration of   
aircraft over our block is the         
v.o.r.station south of Daventry.
