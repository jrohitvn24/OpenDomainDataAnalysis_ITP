 between Newton-on-Ouse and Aldwark    
 Toll Bridge,crossing the River        
 Ouse.Roads lead off to R.A.F.         
 Linton-on-Ouse and housing estates for
 R.A.F. personnel.There are houses on  
 both sides of the main street,but     
 there are no outstanding features.The 
 village lies on the edge of the old   
 Royal Forest of Galtres."Lin" of      
 Linton may mean"by the water" or      
 derived from"line"or flax once grown  
 in this area.                         
   In the early Middle Ages Linton was 
 a baronial fief of the Roos family and
 sold in 1618 to the Appleby family of 
 Teesdale,devout Roman Catholics.In    
 1706 the Manor was bought by Dr.John  
 Radcliffe.On his death in 1714 the    
 Manor of Linton-on-Ouse was bequeathed
 to University College,Oxford,which    
 still owns property in the area.      </content>
