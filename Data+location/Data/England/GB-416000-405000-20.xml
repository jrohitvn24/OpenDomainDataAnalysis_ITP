		<content> Mrs.Turner has lived in Hepworth for  
 35 years.The village has grown to be  
 like two villages.Important events    
 have been the Co-op centenary in 1947 
 and the school centenary in 1984.Until
 1982 only occasional buses went to    
 Huddersfield,now there are minibuses  
 to Holmfirth.Leaving Hepworth school  
 at 14 Mrs.Turner worked as a clerk in 
 the village Co-op which had a grocery,
 butchery and drapery department,      
 earning less than many millworkers.A  
 one week summer holiday was usually   
 spent at Bridlington or Scarborough   
 travelling by coach or train from     
 Holmfirth. There were a few other     
 occasional days holiday during the    
 year.House work is now easier and     
 cleaner than in the past with the     
 introduction of electrical devices.The
 Co-op closed in 1967 becoming a       
 hairdressers and flats.               </content>
