		<content> ST.PETER'S CHURCH                     
 The first known reference to          
 Evercreech was made in the year       
 1066.Two kinds of stone have been     
 used to build Evercreech church.The   
 church clock and chimes comemmorate   
 the Diamond Jubilee of Queen          
 Victoria(1879).Along the south side of
 the church are three gargoyles        
 done by a stone mason from Wells      
 in 1842.Whilst working here he had    
 a disagreement with the Vicar,the     
 publican and two women whom he        
 portrayed as a hideous monster,(the   
 Vicar),a monkey,(the publican)and two 
 gossiping cats,(the women).           
                                       
 THE METHODIST CHURCH                  
 The Methodist Church is in Weymouth   
 Road.It is much smaller than the      
 Parish Church.The school room is used 
 by a nursery school during the week.  </content>
