		<title>15THE PARISH REVEREND</title>
		<content> REV.Clark has been a minister for 12  
 years and has been in this area for 3 
 years. He is in charge of 6 parishes, 
 including Weasenham St.Peter,         
 Weasenham All  Saints, Raynham and    
 Wellingham.                           
             Services                  
     St.  Peter        2 per week      
     All Saints        1  per month    
     Wellingham        3 per year      
 He has performed many Christenings and
 funerals but there has only been one  
 wedding since he has been here.       
 Besides the services, he visits the   
 school and the people of the villages 
 and he thinks his most important task 
 is to lead the parishioners in the    
 worship of God.   At school we enjoy  
 his visits because he makes the       
 stories lively and interesting and    
 often funny. Rev. Clark's  favourite  
 T.V programme is"One Man and His Dog".</content>
