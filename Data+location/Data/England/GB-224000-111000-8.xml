		<content>{Bulldogs:}To play this game you have  
 two people who are "it" and as many   
 others as you like.The object is for  
 the others to run from one end of the 
 playground to the other without       
 getting caught.The last two caught are
 "it" next time.{Joanne Oke            
{Offground it:}To play this,one person 
 is choosen to be "it" and he/she has  
 to catch the others when they are on  
 ground level.Once caught that person  
 becomes "it".This can go on for as    
 long as you like.                     
{Stick-in-the-mud:}One person is       
 choosen to be "it" and the others run 
 freely.If caught by "it",that person  
 has to stand still with their legs    
 apart unless another free person      
 passes under them.When every one is   
 caught,the last one caught becomes    
 "it" for the next time
