		<content>{Rockley Sands}is a quiet area,        
 excellent for holidays.  It is very   
 close to the water and there are many 
 opportunities for water sports.       
 There is a large{caravan site}which   
 caters for summer visitors.  Besides  
 the assortment of caravans, there are 
 entertainment facilities and several  
 small shops and restaurants.  There is
 also a leisure park which seems mainly
 to be used by the children.           
 Just down the road from the caravan   
 site, there is a{Royal Marines}base   
 which covers a large area and is      
 surrounded by fir trees.  The houses  
 outside the base are occupied by the  
 families of those who work at the     
 base.
