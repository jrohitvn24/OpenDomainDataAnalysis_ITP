		<content> This area contains two very attractive
 villages,Gillamoor and Hutton-le-Hole.
 The latter, designated a conservation 
 area,consists of traditional stone and
 pantile cottages,built according to   
 the geological structure of the common
 and stream.Individual houses are not  
 distinctive though several are"listed"
 eg.'Hammer and Hand'1784.The pinfold  
 stands complete but unused.Gillamoor, 
 again built of stone and pantiles is  
 arranged in a T-shape on wide roads   
 with pretty gardens and farmyards.    
 The properties of both villages are   
 mostly owner-occupied.Of some 40      
 Houses in Gillamoor,11 are holiday    
 cottages,5 are council houses and 3   
 are newly built.Of the 75 or so houses
 in Hutton,17 are holiday homes, 3 are 
 council houses and one is new. In the 
 last three years, 20 houses have      
 changed ownership.                    </content>
