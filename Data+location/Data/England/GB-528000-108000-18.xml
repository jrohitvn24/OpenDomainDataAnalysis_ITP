		<title>18GEOLOGY OF THE SOUTH DOWNS</title>
		<content> The fourth year classes went for a    
 walk on the South Downs. We went up by
 Mr. Paul,s farm, Which is quite near  
 our school. The south Downs are mostly
  made of chalk with bits of flint.    
 Chalk is a sedimentary rock. A long   
 Time ago it was made at the bottom    
 of the sea in layers. When the sea    
 creatures died their skeletons and    
 shells went to the bottom of the sea  
 and made a layers crushed the         
 bottom bits into rock.We saw the      
 chalk. It was all white and crumbly.  
 You could write with it. Farmers like 
 chalky soil because the water goes    
 through it easily.                    
  Flint is very hard stone. It is black
 or grey and has sharp edges. cave men 
 used flint for axes and spear heads.
