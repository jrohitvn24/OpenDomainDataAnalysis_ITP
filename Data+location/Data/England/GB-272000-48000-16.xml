		<title>16THE OLD MONASTERY</title>
		<content> One of the most interesting and       
 certainly the largest building in the 
 area is the Old Monastery at Wood     
 Barton, north of Woodleigh.           
 In 1896 Trappist monks from France who
 were not able to worship as they      
 wished came to The South Hams to start
 a new life. They built a very large   
 structure, four storeys high, of      
 stone and some brick. The chapel is   
 constructed of corrugated iron, and   
 has stained glass windows and carvings
 intact.                               
 The monks used the nearby 17th century
 farmhouse as a guesthouse, and on the 
 south facing slopes they planted      
 vines.                                
 After about 20 years the monks        
 returned to France. Now the building  
 is used by the farmer to store grain  
 and machinery.                        
                                       </content>
