		<title>12RECREATION IN EDGEFIELD</title>
		<content> Young people tend to seek their       
 entertainment outside the village, in 
 Holt, Sheringham or Cromer, or at     
 discos in Melton Constable, but they  
 are hampered by lack of transport.    
 Older people go to the Tuesday Club   
 and other events at the village hall. 
 The football field between Rectory    
 Road and Limekiln Lane was given to   
 the village in 1914. It is now used by
 the employees of Bernard Matthews plc,
 turkey breeders, who own several farms
 close to our area.                    
 The public house must also appear     
 under this heading: it provides simple
 meals and is a free house (i.e. not   
 attached to any particular brewery).  
 It is now called 'The three pigs': it 
 used to be 'The Bacon arms'- an       
 example of Norfolk humour?
