		<title>13MUCKLEY CORNER NURSERY.</title>
		<content>  Muckley Corner Nursery was           
established in 1947, and specialises in
growing ornamental and hardy nursery   
stock, and in particular semi-mature   
trees up to one ton in weight.         
  The soil is a light sandy gravel and 
has been heavily enriched with organic 
manure, which makes it one of the      
highest humas soils in the district.   
  The whole nursery is irrigated from  
static mains, supplied from a borehole 
150 ft. deep into the Bunter sandstone 
- water table 67 ft.                   
  The nursery is twelve acres in       
extent, two acres of which were        
reclaimed from the disused Wyrley and  
Essington canal, and the dwelling      
house is situated in the canal bed.    
  The business is labour intensive and 
supports six members of staff in       
conjunction with landscape and tree    
surgery sections.                      </content>
