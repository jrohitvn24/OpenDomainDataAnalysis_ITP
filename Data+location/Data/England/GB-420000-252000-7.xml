		<title>07CLOPTON BRIDGE</title>
		<content> Sir Henry Clopton Knight, Lord Mayor  
 of London built Clopton bridge.In the 
 reign of King Henry the seventh.(1485-
 1509).The bridge is the main road out 
 to the south from Stratford.It is very
 busy.A traffic survey taken on        
 Wednesday 15th May at 1.30p.m.to 1.50 
 p.m. shows that 725 vehicles  used the
 bridge.Of these 435 were leaving.     
 Stratford becomes very conjested      
 during the summer season because of   
 tourists and the traffic often blocks 
 up the gyratory system ( a one way    
 system for vehicles )due to sheer     
 volume of traffic.We saw seven coaches
 in twenty minutes during our survey   
 which shows the large amounts of      
 tourists visiting Stratford.On the    
 town side of Clopton Bridge is the    
 small bus station which serve Stratfor
 d and surrounding villages.
