		<title>17THE CUBS 22ND "B" SO.SHIELDS</title>
		<content> I am a cub in the 22nd "B" Brownsea   
 Hall pack. We now hold the cubs at    
 West Park Community Centre from 6.00- 
 7.30 pm each Monday night. When       
 everyone is there we make te grand    
 howl. This is when we promise to do   
 our best to Akela, the scout leader.  
 Our leaders are Akela the wolf, Keego 
 the fish, Kaa the snake and Sharda.   
 The cub movement is based on the      
 Jungle Book Story by Rudyard Kipling. 
  To become a cub you have to learn    
 four things: 1{The Cub Sign.}2{The    
{Grand Howl.}3{The Cub Scout Law and   
{Promise}4{The Jungle Book Story.}After
 you do these you are invested,and then
 do badge work. There are the{         
{bronze,silver}and{gold}arrows. The    
 further you go the harder it is. In   
 our pack there are two "sixes" or     
 groups. You join when you are 8 and it
 costs 25p a night.                    </content>
