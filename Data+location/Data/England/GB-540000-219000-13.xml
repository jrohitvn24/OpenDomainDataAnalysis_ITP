		<content>   Looking at our map we discoved The  
 Pest House. Why was it so called? It  
 is believed to have been built        
 originally as an isolation hospital   
 for the village and the date over the 
 door was 1767. The place eventually   
 became part of Lordship Farm and was  
 occupied by farm labourers until 1914.
 On some Ordnance survey maps it is    
 shown as Bush Wood Cottage.           
   The Pest House lies across the      
 fields, in the centre of a wood,      
 behind The Lordship.Very little of it 
 remains today.At one time coal was    
 delivered once a year and water had to
 be lugged over from Lordship Farm     
 unless the land-drains were full. The 
 open fireplace is still to be seen    
 there but generally the house is in   
 ruins but we thought that it was very 
 interesting to learn that such a place
 had once existed.                     </content>
