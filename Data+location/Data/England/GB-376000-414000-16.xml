		<title>16SHOPPING IN RAMSBOTTOM</title>
		<content> Most of the{shops}in Ramsbottom are in
 Bridge Street.This street was         
 constructed after the diversion of a  
 brook.It used to be known as Water    
 Street.                               
 Rows of terraced houses were built    
 along the street from 1820 to         
 1860.Most of these have since been    
 converted to shops. Today there are   
 about 37 shops, offices and buildings 
 altogether ranging from bakers and    
 butchers, to clothes shops and banks. 
 Many of the businesses are{family-run}
{concerns}and have been in the same    
 family for over 100 years. In 1984 the
 Council granted permission for a small
{market}to be set up behind Bridge     
 Street.                               
 The smaller settlements around        
 Ramsbottom do not have many shops and 
 most of the residents travel into     
 Bury to do their shopping.            </content>
