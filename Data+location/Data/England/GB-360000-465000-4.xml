		<title>04Wray Endowed School: History</title>
		<content> Wray School, endowed by Captain       
 Richard Pooley, was built in 1684 and 
 rebuilt in 1885. The original         
 datestone was replaced above the front
 door. Captain Pooley left Â£20 in his  
 will towards the building of a school 
 on his land at Weind Head, Wray, and  
 Â£200 to be invested in land. The      
 income from this investment was to be 
 paid to the schoolmaster 'for ever'.  
 According to tradition, Richard Pooley
 and his brother were abandoned, when  
 young, by their father, on a journey  
 taking cows from Wray to Coventry.    
 Luckily, a rich lady found them and   
 looked after them. Richard joined     
 Cromwell's army and became a captain. 
 After the Civil War, he returned to   
 Wray and invited all the women to a   
 feast at the inn and there, mother and
 son were reunited. He stayed in Wray  
 for the rest of his life.             </content>
