		<content> Area near the coast is very flat      
 becoming slightly undulating          
 inland.Therefore,outstanding features 
 like pylons on Bacton Gas Site,water  
 tower &amp; Lighthouse at Happisburgh can 
 be seen over most of the area;also    
 many church towers. In N.E. of        
 area trees are badly bent due to      
 prevailing salty winds.               
{Roads &amp; Trees}Older lanes are winding 
 with banks either side often topped by
 hedges. Newer roads sometimes have    
 side grass verges &amp; there are small   
 groups of trees in corners of fields &amp;
 small plantations.                    
{Commons}There are 2 small commons     
 which are not grazed so growth is     
 scrubby with beautiful display of     
 gorse in the spring.                  
{Coastline}Very small area of coastline
 consisting of a seawall &amp; a smooth    
 sandy beach divided by groynes.       </content>
