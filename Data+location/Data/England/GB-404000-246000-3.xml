		<title>03Harvington Church.</title>
		<content> Harvington has one church and one     
 chapel.Norton also has a church.      
 Harvington church has six bells       
 and they work automatically by use of 
 a clock.The church is not all the same
 age .It was built in the twelfth      
 century and enlarged in the           
 fourteenth.In eighteen hundred and    
 fifty-five a brooch spire made of     
 copper was added. The copper has      
 eroded and the spire is now coloured  
 green .The spire is ninety nine feet  
 high with the cockerel.The church used
 to own the whole village.It now owns a
 farm called Green Street.The cottage  
 where the church candle maker used to 
 live is being repaired because the    
 front timbers are rotten.This cottage 
 is close to the church.There is a     
 witches'door on the north side of     
 the church. I was christened in the   
 village church.                       </content>
