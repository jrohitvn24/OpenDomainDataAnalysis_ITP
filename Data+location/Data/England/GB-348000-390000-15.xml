		<content> creates the profit rather than the    
 margin per unit. Cheaper goods are    
 regarded by small shops as a threat.  
 The matter which hs occupied most     
 space in a local newspaper (The       
 St.Helens reporter) has been the      
 proposed closure of local schools as  
 responce to falling school rolls.It   
 was proposed to merge Rainhihh high   
 School with another in the area.      
 Protest groups of parents and PTA     
 (Parent Teacher Association) members  
 were formed to "defend" the school,   
 and the amalgamation will no longer   
 take place. The influence of these    
 'action groups' upon the final        
 decision is uncertain when compared to
 the more important party political    
 decisions.
