		<content> In Bilsthorpe the village is split    
 into 2 halves, the original settlement
 around the Church and the newer half  
 built from 1928 onwards. The older    
 part is mostly farms and building of  
 red brick and pantile roofs. 6        
 semi-detached council houses, the rest
 are mostly new detached houses. In the
 newer half there are 2 major housing  
 estates, one built by the Coal Board  
 and the other by the Council. These   
 are mainly 3 bedroomed semi-detached  
 houses with some Old Age Bungalows. A 
 Caravan Site is situated at the edge  
 of the village. There has been a      
 steady increase in home ownership.    
 In Eakring the houses are mainly      
 detached red brick and pantile roofs. 
 There is a council estate of 47       
 semi-detached houses plus 6 bungalows 
 which were built in 1947. Very little 
 new housing has taken place.          </content>
