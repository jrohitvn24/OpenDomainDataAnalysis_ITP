		<title>05VISIT TO MARSHALL'S</title>
		<content> One morning we set off for Marshall's 
 at Brookfoot. We passed the stone     
 works and went to the head office. A  
 man named Maurice came to meet us and 
 take us to another room. Here a man   
 showed us how a drainage system       
 worked. Water flowed into little holes
 in the path and into a pipe drainage  
 system where the water flows into a   
 pipe and into the sewers.             
 In the room there were examples of    
 Marshall's stone. In the stone works  
 there is a tall building and a muddy  
 river which looks like wet cement. We 
 looked at a quarry and stacks of      
 stone. We then walked round and saw a 
 massive piece of sandstone being cut  
 into bits by a huge saw being run by a
 big wheel.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
