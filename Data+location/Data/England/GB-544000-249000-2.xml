		<title>02The Church of All Saints</title>
		<content> All Saints' Church, Little Shelford,  
 was built in 1080.The de Freville     
 family played a great part in founding
 certain parts of this church.Sir John 
 de Freville built the chancel and     
 founded the tower,while his son's wife
 founded the chantry.The Nave and tower
 were rebuilt in 1450,and in 1633 the  
 pulpit and canopy were installed.The  
 ancient stained glass windows in      
 Chantry of the church were still      
 intact in 1802.Repairs were made on   
 the church in the year of 1854,and the
 Sanctuary was rebuilt in 1878.There   
 are six bells,and the present Rector's
 name is Stephen.G.Taylor.The church is
 not locked,and people are free to go  
 in and either pray or read the        
 interesting leaflets.Inside the church
 there are also many plaques in memory 
 of old villagers,and rectors.
