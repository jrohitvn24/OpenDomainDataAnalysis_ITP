		<content> Vowchurch is a very small village     
 located in foothills of black         
 Mountains. It lies in rural location  
 of Golden Valley on B4348 which runs  
 towards Hereford in east. The area is 
 low in population and is agricultural 
 in nature. The village scores very low
 in terms of amenities but is served by
 its neighours in some of these        
 respects. Besides farming tourism     
 provides some income. Most families in
 area find a vehicle quite essential   
 since public transport remains        
 infrequent. It is necessary to travel 
 to find essential such as shools,     
 shops, post office etc
