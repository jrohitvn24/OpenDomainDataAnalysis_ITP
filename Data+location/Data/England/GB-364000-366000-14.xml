		<content>   {Winsford Flashes}were created by   
 subsidence.This took place when salt  
 had been removed by mining and this   
 caused the land to sink.There are two 
 main types of{subsidence.}The first   
 being known as{linear}the second known
 as{crater.}The subsidence at the      
 flashes is crater.The flashes were    
 filled with water from the{River      
{Weaver}which runs past the{Meadowbank 
{Rock Salt Mine.}                      
    One of the worst hit areas for     
 reckless pumping was{Northwich}which  
 suffered much damage to its buildings.
 This should never happen again as     
 pumping is now controlled.
