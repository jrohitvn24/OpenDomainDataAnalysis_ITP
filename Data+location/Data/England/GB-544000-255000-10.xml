		<title>10Cycling in Cambridge</title>
		<content>    In Cambridge there are so many     
 cyclists that special lanes have been 
 marked on the roads for them to travel
 along,for example,the one on Hills    
 Road,over the bridge.  In 1982,a      
 traffic light was installed to control
 one of these lanes to stop accidents. 
 Many people were getting knocked off  
 their bikes particularly when they    
 changed traffic lanes.                
   Because it is a University town,    
 Cambridge has a greater bicycle popul-
 ation than most. The students find it 
 a quick,cheap way to travel between   
 the different colleges which make up  
 the University, and during term time  
 you can see hundreds of them weaving  
 their way through the traffic, trying 
 to get to their lectures on time.     
    A great many tourists also hire    
 bicycles as it is an ideal way to ex- 
 plore Cambridge.                      </content>
