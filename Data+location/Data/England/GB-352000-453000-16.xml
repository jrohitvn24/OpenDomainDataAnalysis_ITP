		<content> Being a farming area the working life 
 here is very much affected by the     
 weather. The rainfall here is heavy,  
 drought rarely being a problem, but   
 the summer of 1985 has been extremely 
 wet. Hay crops have been poor and in  
 some cases very difficult to get in at
 all. The same can be said of silage,  
 as it is very damaging to take heavy  
 machinery on to the sodden ground.    
 Cattle have had to be taken inside    
 earlier than usual. Snow is not a     
 major problem every winter, but while 
 great efforts are always made by the  
 local authorities as well as farmers  
 to clear the roads used by the milk   
 tankers, lanes to farms some distance 
 from the roads may be blocked or only 
 negotiable by tractor for several     
 days. If it looks like snow school    
 children may be kept at home in case  
 they may not be able to get back.     </content>
