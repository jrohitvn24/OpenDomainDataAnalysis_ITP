		<content> This{listed building}is now a farm    
 house which was once part of a large {
{manor house.}The building is thought  
 to have been completed in{1510.}It    
 lies on the western side of the{Fal   
{Valley}with buildings of the clay     
 industry overpowering its western     
 boundary. The old arched doorway is   
 now blocked. Above it is a{keystone}  
 with a grotesque bearded human head.  
 On the same granite facade is a{      
{mullioned window}and a chimney on top 
 of which is the original{chimney pot.}
 In the fine cottage garden are several
{corn mushrooms}and a{corn measure.}The
 corn was stacked around the mushrooms 
 to enable it to dry. The measure      
 surmounts a vertical stem and consists
 of a "bowl" with a tubular hole.      
 The most distant walls of the cowsheds
 show evidence of having once been a   
 chapel.                               </content>
