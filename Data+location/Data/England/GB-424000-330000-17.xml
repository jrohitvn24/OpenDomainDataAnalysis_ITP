		<title>17THE BROOK,HILTON</title>
		<content> In 1979 the Severn Trent Water        
 Authority decided to divert the course
 of Hilton Brook because it kept       
 flooding all the fields and some      
 houses.They dug out a new channel for 
 the brook and made it deeper and wider
 so it wouldnt flood.The old brook has 
 been blocked off by a small dam to    
 stop the water from getting in to the 
 old brook except for when the new     
 brook floods.In 1983 the water        
 Authority completed a survey of fish  
 in the brook.Here is a list of the    
 fish found there: Chub,dace,loach,    
 trout,gudgeon,grayling,minnows,       
 bullhead,stickleback,pike and perch.  
 During the summer months many people  
 from the village spend time by the    
 brook,as it is an ideal place for     
 picnics and walking.
