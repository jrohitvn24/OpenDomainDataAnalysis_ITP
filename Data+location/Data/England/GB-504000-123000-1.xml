		<title>01WISBOROUGH GREEN</title>
		<content> This area contains the southern half  
 of Wisborough Green, population 1300. 
 The A272, main road, between Petworth 
 and Billingshurst, carries traffic    
 past the attractive village pond. The 
 village is dominated by a small hill, 
 on which stands the church of St.     
 Peter ad Vincula and commands views of
 the surrounding countryside.  The area
 is drained by the River Arun which    
 winds its way through farmland - some 
 pasture, some arable - interspersed   
 with woodland.                        
 Attractive old houses in the Wealden  
 vernacular, built in brick, tile-hung 
 or weatherboards, some roofed in      
 Horsham stone, border the road.  To   
 the West is the Zoar Chapel, built in 
 1753, with its own small graveyard.   
 The few shops are sufficient to supply
 th daily needs of villagers.
