		<content> By Ladies Pool in Blakedown can be    
 seen the remains of the Iron works.   
 They were opened in 1856 by Mr Samuel 
 Bradley of Springbrook House. His     
 factory was mainly used for making    
 iron axles for high class trade and   
 these were exported as far away as    
 Australia and the Cape. The machinery 
 was driven by a water wheel fed by    
 water from Ladies Pool. Incidentally  
 there were many water mills between   
 Blakedown and Kidderminster. The      
 blacksmith's house is no longer       
 standing, but the forge still exists  
 and you can see the rings on the      
 inside walls where they tied the      
 horses.                               
 In 1950 a Honey Farm was set up by a  
 Mr Bradford in Belbroughton Road.     
 Honey was brought from nearby honey   
 farms for processing and then sold all
 over the country.                     </content>
