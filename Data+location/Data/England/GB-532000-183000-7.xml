		<title>07ISLINGTON'S HOUSING CONTRAST</title>
		<content>   I have lived in Islington for a year
now,and go to a mixed comprehensive    
school.This piece describes the        
contrast in areas in Islington, the    
houses,the people. This contrast will  
be everywhere across England, but it is
especially concentrated in Islington.  
   Around my school there are several  
estates. Some are broken down areas,the
sort where it is not safe at night.    
These flats are boardered by well kept 
l9th century terraced houses, in court-
yards and squares.Within a few streets 
the cost of property can go up, and the
environment drastically change.I think 
the attraction of moving to Islington  
for many wealthier people is that it is
near to the City and the West End.It is
somehow quite horrifying that even     
within areas we have created even      
smaller areas and class groups.
