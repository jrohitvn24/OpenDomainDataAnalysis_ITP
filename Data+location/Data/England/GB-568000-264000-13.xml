		<title>13RIVER AND RIVER CROSSINGS</title>
		<content>The River Kennett runs through our area
from Dalham to Kentford. There are 8   
bridges but Packhorse Bridge in Moulton
is the oldest. It is an official       
monument and was built in 1446 in the  
Anjou Period, although there is        
evidence that a bridge has existed     
since Roman times. Packhorse Bridge and
another are of flint construction,     
both of which have recently been       
renovated. There are also two fords in 
Moulton to enable large vehicles to    
cross the river, as the Packhorse      
Bridge is for pedestrians and the      
other only for light traffic. Another  
very old bridge carries the mainroad   
through Kentford. Because the land is  
very chalky the River Kennett is dry   
for much of the year but in periods of 
heavy rain it can flood very quickly   
In the late 1960's it flooded twice    
causing consderable damage.            </content>
