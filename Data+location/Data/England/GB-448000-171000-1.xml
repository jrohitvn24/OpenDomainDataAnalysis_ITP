		<title>01THE HERMITAGE/CURRIDGE AREA</title>
		<content>   Hermitage and Curridge are two      
 villages to the north of the town of  
 Newbury.Although they lie within the  
 Western Corridor they have been only  
 lightly affected by new  building     
 development.Hermitage, the larger, is 
 in the process of having a new estate 
 of some 40 houses built.              
   The M4, which skirts the northern   
 edge of the area, has made  great     
 changes to communications eg          
 most people work outside the area. The
 commuter nature of the area is        
 demonstrated by the high cost of      
 housing - typically Â£35,000 to        
 Â£150,000.                             
   Most of the land in the area is     
 woodland or farmland. The two main    
 exceptions being the Royal Engineers  
 School of Military Survey, and the    
 Cementation works.
