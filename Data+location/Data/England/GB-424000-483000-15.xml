		<title>15Changing Times, Snape,Yorks.</title>
		<content>   The retired Headmistress is 71 and  
 has lived in Snape all her life. She  
 has noticed many changes in the       
 village. People now have electricity  
 in their homes, more people have a    
 telephone and radios have replaced    
 gramophones.Roads were rough and stony
 and not smooth as they are today.There
 were no cars,tractors or motor-driven 
 machinery.People walked to and from   
 Bedale,travelled by bicycle, horse and
 cart or on a wagonette.Today most     
 people travel by car or bus.There are 
 more people and houses in Snape now   
 than when she was young.Nowadays      
 farmers employ fewer men because they 
 have tractors and farming equipment.
