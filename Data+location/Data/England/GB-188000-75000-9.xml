		<title>09AMATEUR DRAMATICS IN PADSTOW</title>
		<content> Padstow has its own Theatre Group     
 called{The Kernow Players.}We meet    
 every Tuesday at 7 o'clock at the {   
{Pollard Hall}in Barry's Lane.We have  
 just bought the Pollard Hall ourselves
 so that we can design our own stage   
 settings and leave them out during    
 rehearsals and performances because we
 used to use the Church Hall but had to
 put everything away each time we used 
 it.                                   
 We raised the money to buy the Hall by
 putting on Shows and dressing up and  
 performing at Fetes and other such    
 functions.Our biggest production is   
 always the{Christmas Pantomime.}On    
 Tuesdays we rehearse different scenes 
 and do some acting lessons then sing  
 some songs.Suddenly it is 9 o'clock   
 and its time to go home.
