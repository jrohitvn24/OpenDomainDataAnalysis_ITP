		<content> One of the keynotes of a thriving     
 rural community is the way in which   
 its people join together to accomplish
 projects, or individually take on     
 responsibility for other individuals  
 and tasks.                            
                                       
 In 1985, through a house-to-house     
 collection, organised and operated by 
 a comparative few, over Â£165 were     
 raised for Christian Aid Week.  This  
 is to be seen within the context of   
 many other appeals to which members of
 the community respond with equal      
 realism and generosity.               
                                       
 Individual needs are the concern of   
 all.  The Neighbourhood Watch scheme, 
 recently introduced to give a greater 
 degree of security to isolated resi-  
 dents of the area, is but one example.
