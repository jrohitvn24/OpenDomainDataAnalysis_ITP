		<title>14RELIGION IN NORTH YATE</title>
		<content> A few people regularly go to church.  
 Others just go on special occasions,  
 such as weddings, funerals and        
 christenings. Most people say that    
 they believe in God, but a few people 
 don't believe in God at all, and a    
 number say that they don't really     
 know. Of the people that are believers
 the majority belong to Church of      
 England. A few are Methodist. The     
 general feeling is that people are    
 less religious than they used to be.  
 Some people hold the opinion that you 
 don't have to go to church to be      
 religious .Those people that do       
 still go regularly seem to be very    
 strong in their faith.The most popular
 churches in the area are St James the 
 Less in Iron Acton and St Mary's in   
 Yate.
