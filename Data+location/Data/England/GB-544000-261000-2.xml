 LIQUID).AFTER SEPARATION OF THE       
 DEBRIS,IT IS BROKEN DOWN.THE MUDDY    
 LOOKING SLUDGE GOES INTO ONE TANK     
 WHERE A CHEMICAL IS ADDED.THE WATER IS
 THEN SQUEEZED OUT LIKE A SPINDRYER.THE
 SLUDGE IS PILED UP IN A BIG SKIP FOR  
 THE FARMERS COLLECT AS FERTILIZER.MOST
 OF THE EFFLUENT (80%)COMES FROM       
 CAMBRIDGE CITY.THE WATER PASSES       
 THROUGH THE PUMP HOUSE,BEFORE THE     
 EFFLUENT IS FINALLY LET OUT INTO THE  
 RIVER CAM.THE SEWAGE WORKS HAS BEEN   
 COMPUTERISED FOR OPERATIONAL PURPOSES 
 AND HAS SPARE CAPACITY AT THE MOMENT.
