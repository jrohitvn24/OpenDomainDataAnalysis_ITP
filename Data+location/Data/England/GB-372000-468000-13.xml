		<title>13BUILDINGS CLAPHAM NEW HOUSES</title>
		<content> We went to see the new houses at the  
 top of Clapham.There were 5 houses and
 they were joined together.These houses
 were built for the Rowntree Trust and 
 are intented for first time buyers.The
 row was called  Clapdale Way.Two of   
 the houses had stone on the walls     
 outside and the other three had rough 
 cast cement .They had different       
 porches aswell.The porches  on the    
 cemented houses  were like half a roof
 and the other porches were like whole 
 roofs.On the cemented houses the stone
 was showing round the doors and       
 windows.The houses had stone bits     
 which the chimney came out of.The     
 slates on the roofs were probably man 
 made.The frames for the porches were  
 wooden.The porches did not have walls 
 or doors.The chimney pots were quite  
 tall.They were made from rusty        
 coloured clay.                        </content>
