		<title>04ST PETER'S CHURCH, DEVIZES</title>
		<content>    St Peter's Church is next to St    
 Peter's School, Bath Road in Devizes. 
 It was built in 1866, and made of     
 stone with the roof made of tiles.    
    Inside the church there are three  
 large pillars. There are some statues,
 one of Mary holding her son Jesus and 
 another of St Peter.  In his left hand
 he holds two keys, one is gold, which 
 stands for Heaven, and the other is   
 lead, which stands for hell.  There   
 are statues depicting the crucifixion 
 on the rood screen.  Jesus is on the  
 cross, and on one side there is John  
 and on the other is Mary.             
    There are seven windows with out   
 any stained glass in them.  The west  
 window has the most interesting image 
 because it has one angel on each side 
 of Jesus.  One of the angels has a    
 shield.  Above it is a sword which is 
 on the left hand side of Jesus.       </content>
