		<content>   Most children go to schools run by  
 the state. Education is paid for by   
 rates levied on all property,         
 commercial and private.               
   Children start infant school at     
 five. Junior school is from seven to  
 eleven.                               
   At secondary school, from eleven to 
 sixteen, the curriculum is wide, but  
 geared to exams. There is a teacher   
 for each subject. You can leave school
 at sixteen, or you can go on to sixth 
 form college. You can go to University
 or College at eighteen.               
   There is a Primary system of        
 education for which parents pay       
 directly to the school. These private 
 schools are very exam concious        
 compared with state schools.          
   There are special schools for       
 handicapped children.
