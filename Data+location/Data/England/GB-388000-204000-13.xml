		<title>13LYPIATT PARK</title>
		<content> Lypiatt Park is a very big house and  
 parts of it are very old.  The oldest 
 remaining part is a 14th century      
 granary. It has stables, a dove-cote  
 and its own small church which is now 
 used as a store. It has turretted     
 decorations all along the top like a  
 castle. The park, once full of deer is
 now about ten acres It has magnificent
 views from the front garden all along 
 the Toadsmoor Valley. From it one can 
 see almost all of the land covered in 
 this part of the survey. For centuries
 it was the home of wealthy and        
 influencial families most notably the 
 Stephens.  Now most of the land has   
 been sold off. For the last thirty    
 years it has been owned by an         
 internationally famous sculptor.      
 The interior furnishings have been    
 changed to complement the contemporary
 sculptures which are housed there.    </content>
