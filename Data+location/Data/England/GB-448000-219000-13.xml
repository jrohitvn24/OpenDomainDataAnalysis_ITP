		<title>13Transport from Kirtlington</title>
		<content>     We carried out a survey which was 
completed by 61% of people living in   
the village. Kirtlington is on the     
Oxford to Bicester bus route. We found 
that 7.9% of villagers use the bus     
daily, 18% use it weekly, 7.5% monthly,
29.7% use it less than once a month and
46.6% never use it. The train service  
from Tackley is a much less popular    
means of transport. Nobody from        
Kirtlington uses it daily or weekly.   
0.8% of Kirtlington residents use it   
monthly and 2.6% use it less than once 
a month. 96.6% never use it.           
     12.2% of households do not have a 
motor car. 42% have one car and 39.4%  
have 2 cars. 6.4% have 3 or more cars. 
Motor cycles are not so popular, 80.5% 
of households do not have one at all.  
15% have one motor cycle. Push bicycles
however, are very popular, 46.5% of    
households have 2 or more.             </content>
