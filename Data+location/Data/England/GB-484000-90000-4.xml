		<title>04SELSEY BILL BIRDS</title>
		<content>    Many{seabirds}fly past Selsey Bill.
 Some birds get blown off course,that's
 when we see unusual ones like{serin   
 and{nightingale.}A seabird called the 
{skua}is the most famous rare visitor; 
 it has black wings and tail.{Eider    
{ducks}come more often than they used  
 to.Once there were 12-20 a year,now   
 there are 180-190.They rest on the    
 Mixon rocks. About 150-160 different  
 sorts of birds come every year. Selsey
 has no bird observatory,because most  
 birds fly through by way of the Isle  
 of Wight.The best time to see{migrant 
 birds is in late spring and mid-      
 autumn.There are more to be observed  
 in early morning to about 11 o'clock. 
 Birds come to Selsey Bill because of  
 the large fields and feeding areas,and
 because the Bill juts out into the    
 Channel.These include{songbirds,      
{warblers}and{house martins.           </content>
