		<title>05FARMING 50 YEARS AGO</title>
		<content>    It was hard work and you got very  
 little pay.Farmers had more people    
 working for them (10 to 12 men).Every 
 farm had a variety of animals and grew
 different crops.Most farms had horses 
 (Clydesdale or Shire).They were used  
 for reaping,ploughing,carting goods   
 and sowing.They worked from 3 till 20 
 years of age.At 6 am. the horses were 
 fed on oats and chaff.They'd get the  
 machine out and check it,harness the  
 horses up and go to the fields.At     
 7.00 am. they'd start working.They    
 carried on till 12.15 pm. with only a 
 short break.They fed the horses and in
 half an hour back to work.11 men would
 be threshing while another 5 or 6     
 started building stooks.At 7.30 pm.   
 they'd pack up and go home to tea and{
 bed down the horses for the night and 
 feed them. At the end of the harvest, 
 the farmer gave his men a good feast. </content>
