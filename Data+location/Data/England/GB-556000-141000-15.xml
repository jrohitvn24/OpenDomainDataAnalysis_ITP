		<content> The St.Johns Sport and Y Centre houses
a large selection of activities which  
are available for young and old. This  
modern complex provides facilities for 
swimming, diving, badminton, squash,   
table tennis,roller-skating and many   
other sports and hobbies.              
 Every Friday there is a Y club for    
teenagers when many of these sports can
be enjoyed. On Saturday there are two  
Roller Discos. During the week there   
are also 'Tiny's' gym lessons,         
computing and martial arts.            
 A new, exciting development is the    
Pagoda Youth Actities Centre, opened in
April 1985 next door to the main sports
complex. This consists of a central    
socialising area with small specialist 
rooms leading off from it. In these    
there are facilities for woodwork,     
computing, drama, dance, photography,  
art, motor maintenance and many sports.</content>
