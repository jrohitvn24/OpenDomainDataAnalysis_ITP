		<title>13BASILDON NE: ST. PETER'S</title>
		<content>{St. Peter's Church}at Nevendon is one 
 of the oldest churches in Basildon. It
 was built as a chapel for the Lord of 
 the Manor in the 13th. century.       
 Additions were made in 1322. Wood was 
 used extensively in the construction  
 of the church although the panelling  
 inside and the altar dates from l928. 
 Carvings were by local craftsmen, one 
 from Pitsea who was a violin maker.   
 The wooden{coat of arms}dates back to 
 1780 and is the only one in Essex that
 has the lion over the crown. A tunnel 
 underground leads from the church to  
 nearby Nevendon Hall and this was used
 as an escape route for smugglers. Near
 the church is the Rectory which is    
 about 200 years old.                  
 In the grounds is a{tithe barn}which  
 is mentioned in the Domesday Book.
