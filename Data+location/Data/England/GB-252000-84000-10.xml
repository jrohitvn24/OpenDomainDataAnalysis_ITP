		<title>10The Badgers of Dartmoor</title>
		<content>   The extensive workings of{Foxhole   
{Mine}are now being reclaimed by the   
 moor. Deep gullies, once the scene of 
 industry are filled with growing      
 heather and whortleberry. In this     
 lonly part of the moor the badger can 
 live undisturbed.                     
   If you follow the mine workings,    
 easing your way through the gullies,  
 and over the spoil heaps you may come 
 upon a hole in the ground that is     
 occupied by a badger. Then you have to
 be lucky and make sure the wind is    
 blowing towards you as you wait for   
 dusk.                                 
   As the sky darkens and the ghosts of
 the tinners seem to touch you, you    
 could see the black and white face of 
 Brock peering shortsightedly and      
 suspiciously out into the gathering   
 dusk. Keep still and quite and you    
 will see the badgers of Dartmoor.     </content>
