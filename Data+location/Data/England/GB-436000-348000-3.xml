		<content> A DAY IN MY LIFE by VICKY JONES.      
 I woke up at 7 o'clock on Saturday    
 morning.I heard Dad downstairs cooking
 the breakfast.At 7.30 I dressed and   
 went downstairs.I watched Alice in    
 Wonderland on the video.I took Mum a  
 cup of tea and went to Diane Flemmings
 for my dance lesson.Later I went      
 weight training at the Rose &amp; Crown.I 
 had lemonade then I went to play with 
 Paul and Tracy who live there.We      
 played Snap then I went back to       
 training.I did 60 leg raises,4 lots   
 of 20 situps,2 lots of twisters,and 4 
 lots of aeroplanes with 10lbs weights 
 on my fingers.After that I did my     
 jogging.Later,at home,I rode my bike  
 until teatime.After tea I watched T.V.
 then I went to my Granny's.When we    
 came home I had a drink of coffee and 
 went to bed at 10 o'clock.
