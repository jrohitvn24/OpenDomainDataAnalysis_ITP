		<title>02LYDEARD ST. LAWRENCE CHURCH.</title>
		<content> Lydeard St. Lawrence Church is quite  
 small. When you walk through the door 
 straight ahead of you is another door.
                                       
 The church has four sets of pews and  
 at the back of the church are two     
 pews. Just in front of the two pews   
 there is a font which is turned upside
 down because a {ROUND HEAD }was       
 christened in it. He was on the       
 government's side and the people of   
 Lydeard St Lawrence were on the King's
 side.                                 
                                       
 At the front of the church there is a 
 LADY CHAPEL which is dedicated to the 
 Virgin{Mary.}Next to the Lady Chapel  
 is the{CHANCEL where} there are three 
 pews for the choir and the organ.     
{                                      
 The{TOWER}is high.  At the top there  
 are gargoyles.                        </content>
