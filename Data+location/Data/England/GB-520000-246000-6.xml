 We like to play games together in our 
 school playground.Our favourites are  
 chasing games.                        
                                       
          BRITISH BULLDOG              
 This game is played in a certain area.
 3 or more people can play. One person 
 is "IT" and stands in the middle of a 
 rectangle.The other players have to   
 cross the rectangle without being     
 caught by the person in the middle.If 
 anyone is caught,"IT" taps them on the
 shoulder and says"British Bulldog     
 1-2-3".That person then has to help   
 catch the others.When everyone is     
 caught,the person who was caught first
 becomes the new "IT".
