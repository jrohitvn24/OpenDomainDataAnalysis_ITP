		<title>07Factories,Pin Green,Stev.</title>
		<content>   In our area there were 31           
{ factories,}we surveyed 16.Most of    
 them work 9 hours a day,Monday to     
 Friday with half day Saturday.There   
 are three different sorts of          
 factories.There were 8 factories that 
 serviced things ,4 that{made things}  
 and 4{commercial.}Between five and    
 thirty people work in each factory.At 
 lunchtime there are quite a few who   
 bring sandwiches but most of them go  
 to the pub.Two or three factories only
 have half an hour lunch break but most
 have an hour.                         
    All the factories have logos which 
 are signs a factory has to mark its   
 company.{Pot Pourri's}logo is" P.P".  
 Pot Pourri sounds like a herb and     
 spices factory but it really makes    
 Comedy Videos.It is also strange      
 because there are 5O people working   
 there.                                </content>
