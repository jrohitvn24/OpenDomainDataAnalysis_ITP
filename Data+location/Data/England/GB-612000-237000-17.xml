    At twelve o'clock we have lunch.I  
have school dinners which we eat in the
classroom after we have covered the    
desks with tableclothes.We have to eat 
it all up.                             
    After dinner we go out to play on  
the field if it is fine.We come in at  
about 1.15.If it is warm we might have 
swimming.On Mondays we have singing and
on Thursdays we have handbells or      
sewing.                                
    We have another playtime at 2.30   
for 15 minutes.After play we usually   
carry on with whatever we were doing   
before play.We go home at 3.20.        
    When I get home I let the dog out  
then I get mum to take the cover off   
the swimming pool and go for a swim.I  
sometimes play with my best friend     
Sacha.I go inside at six and watch     
televiion.I go to bed at 10.30.        </content>
