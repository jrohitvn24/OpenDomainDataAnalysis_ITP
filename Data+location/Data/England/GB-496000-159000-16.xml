		<title>16Sythwood School, Horsell</title>
		<content>   Although being in a rather urban    
 area, Sythwood is in a pleasant       
 situation with a surprisingly rural   
 element.                              
   Inside the actual building are eight
 classrooms filled with children and   
 helpful teachers. A large school hall 
 is used for other essentials in a     
 school child's life, such as P.E.,    
 assemblies and eating lunch.          
    We have an extremely large playing 
 field with a running track, cricket   
 and rounders pitches in the summer and
 football pitches in the winter. We    
 also have a netball court marked on   
 the playground, along with markings   
 for several other small games.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
