		<content>Interview with Mrs Dolby, Custodian of 
Kirby Hall.                            
  "Before I took this job I was Post   
Mistress at Deene, until the Post      
Office closed in 1974. Then I came to  
Kirby Hall and there's a Custodian's   
House in the grounds.                  
   I work each day, except Mondays, and
its my job to see that the site is kept
in good condition and there's no       
litter. I have to see that the visitors
behave orderly and don't damage the    
Hall. I also have to look after the    
office, taking entrance fees and       
selling guide books and souvenirs. We  
have over five thousand visitors each  
year, mainly between April and August, 
but in Winter it can be very quiet.    
   I look after everything except the  
gardens and contractors see to them. A 
temporary man looks after the office on
Mondays when I'm off duty."            </content>
