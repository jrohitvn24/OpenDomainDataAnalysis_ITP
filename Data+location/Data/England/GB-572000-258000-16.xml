		<title>16Farm crops</title>
		<content> Soil. Heavy clay. Some places chalky. 
 Low rainfall, therefore largely       
 arable. Crops; wheat, barley, oil seed
 rape, sugar beet, field beans,        
 potatoes, oats etc. Woodland covers a 
 few acres in patches and there is a   
 small quantity of pastureland for     
 cattle and sheep. Horticultural crops.
 Several small holdings grow salad and 
 vegetable crops for purchase by local 
 people, also to supply town shops.    
 There is also a garden centre, where  
 plastic or glass greenhouses can be   
 bought, and bedding plants, seeds etc.
 Of the crops, oil seed rape and sugar 
 beet are the most prolific, but large 
 quantities of barley &amp; wheat are      
 regularly grown.With growing surpluses
 in the EEC farmers are trying to      
 switch to other crops, suitable for   
 the soil &amp; weather conditions in the  
 area with equal financial returns.    </content>
