		<title>16A NURSERY SCHOOL IN HESSLE</title>
		<content> The Penshurst School Nursery caters   
 for children aged three and four years
 of age. Children attend either a      
 morning or afternoon session of two   
 and a half hours. Children like       
 playing with things that remind them  
 of real life. Mice and frogs entertain
 the children, while at the same time  
 they are learning. Trains are very    
 popular. One of the corners is        
 decorated to look like a real house.  
 Another is decorated like a hospital. 
 Most of the children enjoy playing    
 with the sand as it reminds them of   
 the sea-side. Sometimes the children  
 have dancing. Usually this means an   
 action song such as "Dry Bones".      
 Halfway through the morning or        
 afternnon there is singing or         
 discussions followed by orange and    
 biscuits. At the end of the session   
 the teacher reads them all a story.   </content>
