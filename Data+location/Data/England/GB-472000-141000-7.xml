		<title>07FARMING (FROYLE/HOLYBOURNE)</title>
		<content> There are 11 farms and a Market Garden
 in our area.                          
{The main crop grown is barley,}mostly 
 for animal feeding. Other crops grown 
 are wheat, oil seed rape, and grass   
 for silage and hay.                   
{For over a hundred years hops have    
{been grown}at West End Farm, picked   
 each Autumn by visiting 'travellers'  
 and dried in a kiln on the farm.  This
 is the last year, however, as there   
 are different Common Market rules for 
 the kind of hops grown, so the English
 hops aren't wanted.                   
 Grass is grown from special seed but  
 there is also rough grazing for sheep 
 at West End and cows at Saintbury.    
 The{sheep}are bred for meat but the   
 Friesian{cows}are kept for milk.      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
