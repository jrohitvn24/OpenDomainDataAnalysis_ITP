		<title>16T.V. PROGRAMES I LIKE</title>
		<content> I have a lot of favourite programmes  
 but these are my very favourite ones  
 starting with cartoons.Dungeons and   
 Dragons this cartoon is about a little
 man called Dongeon Master who leads 7 
 children into lots of adventures      
 against Vengar and his flying horse   
 who wants there magic weapons and in 1
 episode they meet at the dragons grave
 yard where their weapons are most     
 powerful and they beat Vengar.My      
 favourite childrens films are Street  
 Hawk and Knight Rider. Street Hawk is 
 about a moter cycle that goes over 100
 M.P.H.He is a policeman as well and he
 has a friend who he keeps in contact  
 with and his friend built Street      
 Hawk.Knight Rider is similar only it  
 is about a black car that has turbo   
 boost,ejector seat,parachute and lots 
 more buttons.In the series he helps   
 people and solves crimes.             </content>
