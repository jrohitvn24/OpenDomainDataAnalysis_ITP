		<title>10ORIGINS:            QUINTON</title>
		<content>   There is ample proof that Quinton   
 and Marston existed far back in       
 history.                              
   Quinton was recorded in the{Domesday
 Book as Quinentune, derived from the  
 Saxon{'Quean',}indicating the         
 existence of a{'place for women'}or   
 nunnery.                              
   There are traces of{Iron Age and    
{Bronze Age}settlements on{Meon Hill,  
 and the ancient{'ridge and furrow '   
 legacy is quite clearly visible.      
   It would appear that earlier people 
 inhabited first the upper parts of    
 Meon Hill, and then moved further down
 through history.                      
   Over the last half-century, the     
 quiet hamlets have become quite large 
 villages, especially since the arrival
 of the army at Long Marston.
