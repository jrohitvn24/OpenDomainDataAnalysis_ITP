		<content> Park Wood is a deciduous woodland     
 covering 63.0 hectares of land. It is 
 owned by a gentleman who lives in     
 Northampton. The wood has lovely open 
 rides, which add to it's floristic    
 value. The trees are mainly Oak and   
 Ash with some Birch and Sycamore and a
 little Aspen. There is a great deal of
 dead Elm which has resulted in an open
 canopy and made the general condition 
 of the wood poor. Part of the wood has
 recently been cleared by the new owner
 and has been replanted. There is no   
 evidence of the wood being used for   
 game.
