		<content> The bypass:It was thought of in 1965  
by the Ministry of Transport.The       
people on the Blandy estate have signed
a petition against it.Work is due to   
start in 1987.                         
 The New Village hall:A new hall is    
being built on Draycott Road in        
Southmoor.Building started during the  
summer of 1984. Despite a lot of       
opposition from people  of Draycott    
Road,plans went ahead and building     
began.The main complaint was that a    
usually quiet road would be            
disrupted.In Southmoor generally,they  
decided that a new village hall was    
needed and so a committee was set up   
to organise fund raising for this      
expensive project.                     
 Tennis court:If they have enough money
they are planning to build a tennis    
court behind the new village hall.
