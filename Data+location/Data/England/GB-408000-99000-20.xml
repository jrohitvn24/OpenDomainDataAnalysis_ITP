		<title>20CLUBS GUIDES 75 ANNIVERSARY</title>
		<content> 1985 is the 75th year of the{Guides   
 and was celebrated in our area by a   
 pageant at Baiter in Poole. We set off
 at 9.00 a m by coach from the Ferndown
 Sports Centre. When we arrived at     
 Baiter, the Guiders put up a tent for 
 our section, the North East Forest    
 District.                             
 In the morning we had a celebratory   
 parade with Guides carrying banners   
 and flags and singing the special 75th
 year celebration song.                
 There were side shows as well as the  
 actual pageant. We took packed lunches
 and teas, and also bought ice creams  
 from the vans. Everyone had a piece   
 of one of the several celebration     
 cakes. Nearly everyone took part in   
 the pageant about the history of      
 Guiding.
