		<title>13GRAND UNION CANAL OFFCHURCH</title>
		<content>{  Today,}the vast majority of boats   
 seen on the canal are{pleasure boats. 
 However, on occasion, coal carrying   
 barges can be seen. The canal between 
{Bascote Locks and Offchurch,}passes   
 through fields of{rape, wheat and     
{hay,}with occasional{period houses.   
   Two of the three{bridges}spanning   
 the canal have been modernised and    
 are now of{re-inforced  concrete,     
 whereas the bridge close to{Bascote   
{Lock}retains its old world charm of   
{red brick.                            
   At{Bascote}are three locks. Some of 
 the lock gate beams are of original   
 oak or elm though others are now of   
 iron.                                 
  {West of Bascote,}the canal widens at
 a{winding point}where boats may turn. 
   Near{Fosse Rd Bridge}is a{water     
{point}where boats may take on up to   
 125 gallons of water.                 </content>
