 Farmer H has had his four hundred acre
 farm for twenty  months.Before that it
 was a stud farm.The boy and the man   
 who work for him have done so for     
 twenty years and they live locally.He 
 keeps beef cows,sheep,chickens and    
 ponies.He also grows wheat and barley.
 His machines include a combine        
 harvester,four tractors and a land    
 rover as well as ploughs and drills.He
 feels that the new M40 will be a great
 benefit when it is built.He thinks    
 that Chesterton is a nice village     
 although there are no facilities for  
 leisure activities except a neighbours
 tennis court.
