		<title>02THE HISTORY OF MIDDLESBROUGH</title>
		<content>    The first mention of a settlement  
 at the mouth of the river Tees was in 
 the seventh century. It was a very    
 small stopping place in the middle of 
 a journey made by monks and nuns from 
 Whitby Abbey to Durham.               
    The name Middlesbrough comes from  
 Middlesburg, meaning a place in the   
 middle. Middlesbrough was a very      
 unimportant place, with just a few    
 houses until the beginning of the     
 nineteenth century. At this time many 
 industries were being developed and   
 iron and steel was needed to build    
 ships and buildings.                  
    Iron ore was discovered at Eston   
 and Cleveland hills and had to be     
 transported around the country, so a  
 dock had to be built on the river Tees
 for ships to collect iron ore.
