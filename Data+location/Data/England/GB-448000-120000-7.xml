		<content> This is a non-denominational          
 community set up in 1978 in a large   
 Victorian house at Fisher Pond.At     
 present it contains 14 members.They   
 see their original foundation and     
 their lives in the community as"an    
 expression of God's will".The members 
 see their role as providing a haven of
 peace and family life in a society    
 where these values are increasingly   
 threatened. Although not a"closed"    
 community,they have few contacts with 
 the village.                          
 The community is self-supporting.It   
 runs a thriving nursery and landscpae 
 gardening business in the 7 acres     
 surrounding the house.Plants and      
 shrubs are produced for sale at the   
 house,at Marwell Zoological Park and  
 by mail order.They also hve a painting
 and decorating business.
