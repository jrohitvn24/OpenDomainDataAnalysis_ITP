		<content> Westbury is in Buckinghamshire which  
 has selection whereas neighbours      
 Northamptonshire and Oxfordshire have 
 a comprehensive system.This choice has
 an effect on the numbers and movements
 of children from the village school.  
 In 1962 the new school built on what  
 had been Manor gardens had 80 pupils  
 in 4 classes (similar to its          
 predecessor the National school which 
 in 1893 had 84 ageing from 3 to 11 in 
 one class.)Then it was decided to     
 develop Middle schools in Buckingham 5
 miles away so at 9 children transfer  
 to Page Hill for 3 years.After a "12+"
 exam they go to either the Royal Latin
 or Buckingham Secondary. Now with the 
 falling rural population and easier   
 transport there are only 20 pupils at 
 the village school and it is back to  
 its original one teacher for all ages.
