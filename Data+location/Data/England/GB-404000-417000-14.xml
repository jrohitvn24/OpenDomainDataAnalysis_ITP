     The quarry gets its name from the 
 fields around which are shaped like a 
 grandfather clock. It is situated at {
{Withens End,}and is a stone quarry.   
     To get the stone out of the       
 ground they have to drill deep holes, 
 then they put gelignite into the      
 holes which blasts out the stone. A   
 mechanical digger collects the stone, 
 and takes it to the crusher where the 
 stone is crushed into 24cm pieces,    
 which is called aggregate. The pieces 
 of stone are then taken by conveyor-  
 belt to a big storage bin. Wagons     
 come to collect the stone. They drive 
 under the storage bin and the stone is
 loaded. There is an automatic weighing
 machine attached to the conveyor-belt 
 which weighs the stone as it is       
 dropped into the wagons.
