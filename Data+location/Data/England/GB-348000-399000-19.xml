		<title>19 A CRANK 14YR OLD'S DAY</title>
		<content>  I live in a medium-sized detached    
house in Crank with my parents and my  
elder sister.My dad works shifts and my
mother is a housewife,so,except when I 
am at school,life doesn't work on a    
nine to five basis.                    
  In the morning I get up at seven,and 
have breakfast with my mum and dad.At  
8:25am I go out to the bus stop and get
to school at about 8:45am.             
  At dinnertime I usually go to my     
friend's house.School finishes at 4:00 
and after getting on the bus at 4.20,I 
get home at 4:30.                      
  In the evening I don't usually go out
because of transport problems,but at   
the weekend I go to Rainford or St.Hel-
ens.I don't have time out with my      
family much,except in the school       
holidays,but do a lot of cycling.
