		<content>The majority of houses in Brookhouse   
are bungalows and dormers.Many of these
houses have been built in the last 25  
years.There are two houses being built 
at present,one next to Brookhouse Old  
Hall and the other on Broadacre.There  
are two three storey houses named Vale 
Cottages,which were built in 1865 using
stone from the rebuilding of St.Paul's 
Church,Brookhouse.A feature of the     
houses are the stone staircases and    
many of these old houses have wells.In 
1885 Albert Greg changed eight small   
houses into four eyecatching cottages. 
Albert Greg named them Rock M'Jock to  
remind  him of the sound that the      
people could hear from their houses    
when Willow Mill's machinery was       
in use. The oldest house is Gresgarth  
Hall,originally built in the 12th      
Century as a monks' Rest House.Today   
building is restricted in this area.   </content>
