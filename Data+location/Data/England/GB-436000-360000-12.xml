 or anyone who is lonely. It was formed
 in 1964 and there was a competition to
 choose the name. Members come from    
 Woolley{Ley} Stretton{ton} and        
 Brackenfield{field.}Now there are     
 members from Wessington as well.      
 There are 70 members and they meet in 
 St.Mark's Church Rooms on the 4th     
 Tuesday in each month at 7 p.m. There 
 is a bus to collect members.They play 
 cards and dominoes, have a drink of   
 tea and a chat. At the end they play  
 bingo. This year they have visited    
 Bridlington and Elvaston Castle.      
   The{Women's Institute}also meets in 
 the Church Rooms. It was formed in    
 1917 and meets once a month. At the   
 beginning of the evening there is a

 speaker. They have been knitting for  
 the Ethiopian famine appeal this year.</content>
