 Office, church, pub,garage and a      
 school where the hall is used for     
 community activities in the           
 evenings.There are 3 wholesale        
 vegetable growers,a small fruit

 Some houses are used as holiday homes 
 in the summer months.The majority of  
 homes have been built in the 20th     
 Century.There is a Georgian period    
 house which is now used as a
