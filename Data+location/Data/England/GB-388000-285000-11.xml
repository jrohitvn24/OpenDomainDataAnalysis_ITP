		<title>11BRIERLEY HILL HIGH STREET</title>
		<content>   {Brierley Hill High Street}is       
 situated on a section of the main     
{Dudley}to{Stourbridge}road and is     
 virtually equidistant to both these   
 towns. In recent years the High Street
 has undergone (and is stll undergoing)
 considerable change. Like many High   
 Streets up and down the country, the  
 traditional family shops have all but 
 disappeared. The one exception to this
 is the busy{Brierley Hill Market}and  
 in here it is still possible to talk  
 to stall holders whose families have  
 occupied a particular stall for many  
 generations. A few years ago a new    
 super store,{Asda,}was opened in the  
 town and this led to a decline in     
 trade in the smaller High Street      
 shops.Consequently,some of these shops
 ceased trading and were either left   
 empty or taken over by banks, building
 societies or estate agents.           </content>
