		<content> In our 'D' block we have two clubs.   
 The cricket club can trace its history
 back to the 1800's,but was disbanded  
 from about 1965 until it was reformed 
 in 1981. It plays about 30-40 games a 
 season against mainly other village   
 sides although the team does travel to
 Cheltenham and Chipping Norton for    
 games. It is fairly succesful and is a
 typical village side having about five
 good players and six who can          
 occasionally score runs but who are   
 normally out for 1 or 2 runs.         
 The other club is the Manor Art Group 
 who meet each Thursday at Temple      
 Guiting  Manor to draw and paint and  
 receive advice from a retired teacher.
 They hold an exhibition and sale of   
 work each year.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
