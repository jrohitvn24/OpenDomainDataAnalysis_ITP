		<title>03FAWCETTS VOLVO GARAGE</title>
		<content> Fawcetts is a privately owned Volvo   
 sales and service garage employing 14 
 people. It is run by a managing       
 director and has been there for 35    
 years. Both sales and service are     
 equally important. The average service
 or repair cost Â£100. New Volvos range 
 from Â£6,000 to Â£15,000. Ten years ago 
 the cheapest was about Â£2,000. Most   
 popular models today are 5 door       
 hatch-backs and estates. Supplies of  
 spares or new cars arrive daily. They 
 come by sea and road from Sweden.     
 Fawcetts are inspected regularly by   
 Volvo inspectors who check standards  
 of workmanship. The manager feels the 
 site is a good one but could be       
 improved by having bigger workshops   
 and better access.
