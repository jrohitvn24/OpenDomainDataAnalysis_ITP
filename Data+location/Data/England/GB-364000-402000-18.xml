		<title>18OLD SIRS FARM - DAISY HILL</title>
		<content> MY NAME IS RICHARD CLEARY.  I AM TEN  
 YEARS OLD AND HAVE LIVED AT{OLD SIRS  
{FARM}SINCE I WAS ONE.  MEMBERS OF MY  
 FAMILY HAVE LIVED AT THE FARM SINCE   
 THE 1930'S.                           
                                       
 THE NAME OLD SIRS CAME FROM 2 MEN     
 NAMED{RICHARD AND WILLIAM LE SIRES.   
 THEY LIVED IN WHAT IS NOW CALLED OLD  
 SIRS IN ABOUT THE 12TH OR 13TH        
 CENTURY.  THE{BARN}AT OLD SIRS IS IN A
 STYLE COMMONLY BUILT AROUND 1670 BUT  
 THE PRESENT HOUSE WAS BUILT AROUND    
 1800, WHICH MAKES THE FARM 200 YEARS  
 OLD.  IN 1813 A MAN NAMED GREEN LIVED 
 HERE.  HE SPLIT THE FARM BETWEEN HIS  
 TWO SONS.                             
                                       
{FROM THE 1930'S}MY GRANDPARENTS OWNED 
 THE FARM.  AT THIS TIME IT WAS A      
 WORKING FARM.  (CONT ON P.19)
