		<title>18HIGHEST POINT IN KENT.</title>
		<content>                                       
We interviewed Mr. Hall who lives on   
the highest point in Kent. The highest 
point in Kent is near Westerham Heights
which is slightly higher than the      
highest point in Greater London. He    
lives in a bungalow which he and his   
brother-in-law built about 4 years ago.
It is about 824 ft above sea level.    
From his house he can see for about    
30 or 40 miles. He likes living on the 
highest point in Kent very much. He    
gets quite a few visitors in the       
summer because they all come to see the
highest point in Kent and his          
workshop is a napoleonic fort so he    
gets quite a lot of people come to see 
that as well. The trig point was moved 
by the O.S. people basically because   
it would be in the middle of his living
room and they moved it to match up     
with all their other trig points.      </content>
