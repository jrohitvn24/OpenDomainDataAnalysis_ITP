		<title>14A DAY IN THE LIFE OF...</title>
		<content> I wake up at 6.30 and got into the    
 bathroom where I wash and brush my    
 teeth. Then I get dresses (My school  
 uniform is a blue blazer, tie, shirt, 
 trousers and black or grey shoes).    
 Then I have breakfast - a bowl of     
 cereal, milk and fruit juice, and some
 pieces of toast. I go to school on the
 bus. I have seven lessons each day:   
 from Maths, physics, Latin, french,   
 Art, Music, English, Geography,       
 History, Biology and Religion. We also
 have games and physical education. We 
 get a break of fifteen minutes and a  
 lunch break of seventy five minutes.  
 School starts at 9.10 a.m. and        
 finishes at 4.05 p.m. After playing on
 my computer and doing my homework I go
 to bed at about 9.30 p.m.             
 My favourite food is curry, drink is  
 Coke, and I love apple pie and        
 custard.                              </content>
