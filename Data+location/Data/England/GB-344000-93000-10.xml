		<content> Bridport Gundry factory is about{300  
{years old}and used to be powered by   
{water.}It is on 8 acres of land. The  
 company{employs 300 people}now. They  
 work from 8.00am to 5.00pm Monday to  
 Thursday and on Friday they finish at 
 4.00pm. They have work shifts from    
 6.00am to 2.00pm all week. There have 
 been accidents. There was one last    
 week when a man got his hand in a     
 machine and took the tops of his      
 fingers off.                          
                                       
 They make{sports nets, camouflage     
{nets, air cargo nets and fishing nets.
 They used to dry the nets in the      
 street so that is why the{pavements in
{Bridport are so wide.}They send their 
 nets and ropes all over the world.
