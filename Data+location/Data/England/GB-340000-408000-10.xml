		<content> The Augustinian Priory was founded in 
 1189 near Burscough but only it's site
 remains. There are several C.17 houses
 in the town, one of which was called "
 God's Providence " when the occupants 
 escaped the plague.                   
   Parts of some C.18th coaching inns  
 and other Georgian buildings can still
 be seen mainly on Burscough street.   
 The original Town Hall built in 1779  
 still stand in Church Street.         
   There are many Victorian buildings  
 in the area. The Agricultural Club was
 the old Dispensary and Brandreth      
 Hospital was the original cottage     
 hospital. Derby Street retains many of
 it's Victorian buildings including the
 Sessions House. On the site of the old
 market cross lies the Clock Tower and 
 opposite the bus station there is a   
 statue of Disraeli.
