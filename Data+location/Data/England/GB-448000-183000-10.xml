		<title>10^^^Racing Stables, Chilton^^</title>
		<content>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  
  Mr.James Bethell owns a racing       
stable in Chilton with 120 acres of    
land. Racing is popular in this part   
of the country because of the ground.  
The ground is good for riding because  
underneath there is chalk which means  
it has good drainage.                  
   Mr. Bethell has been running the    
racing stables for 3.5 years. He       
employs 10 people. Each person is      
responsible for 3 horses, except the   
headman and travelling headman. In his 
yard, there are 44 stables but only 26 
horses at present.                     
   The yard was built after the second 
world war. He also employs quite a few 
famous jockeys such as Lester Pigott,  
Willy Carson, Steve Cauthen, Pat       
Eddery and John Mathius.
