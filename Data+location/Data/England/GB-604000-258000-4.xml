		<content>This area contains many miles of       
country lanes where two cars can pass  
only with difficulty, and whose        
surfaces are poor.  There are also     
Class B roads and the old A45, which   
had become quite inadequate some twenty
years ago.  The town and villages      
suffered from the constant flow of     
heavy traffic.  The construction of the
new A45 has largely removed this       
problem.  It is a fast dual carriage   
way road which by-passes centres of    
population.  It enables drivers to     
reach the A1 far more swiftly and, in  
conjunction with national road         
improvement schemes, enables people who
start their journey in Stowmarket to   
reduce their travelling time to all    
parts of the country.
