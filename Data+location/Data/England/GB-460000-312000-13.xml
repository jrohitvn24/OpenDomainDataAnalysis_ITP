		<content> We fed the owls every night at        
 6.30.People came down from school, we 
 had to go into the barn very quietly  
 so it would'nt frighten the owls,we   
 fed them on dead chicks,they were from
 the chicken factory.Each owl had 3    
 chicks.We pushed them through a hole  
 in the wire for safety.If they left   
 any chicks we took them out of the    
 cages.                                
          T.V. and release.            
 When we were going to put the 4 Barn  
 Owls into the main cage Central       
 Television paid us a visit to film    
 Mr Marney talking about releasing 4   
 barn owls that he had bred in         
 captivity.Then we went up to          
 Katherines farm and put the barn owls 
 in and after four weeks put two into a
 separate cage.Continued from page
