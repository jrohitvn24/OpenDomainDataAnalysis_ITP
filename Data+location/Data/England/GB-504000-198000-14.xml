		<title>14WHIPPENDELL WOOD</title>
		<content>{Whippendell Woods}is a big 161 acre   
 wood owned by Watford Borough Council.
 It is surrounded by lovely countryside
 and is very peaceful.It has 250 diff- 
 erent flowering plants, 58 different  
 birds,21 mammals and 40 spiders.      
 Most people come from local towns and 
 villages by car.The woods are just    
 there for people to enjoy and to help 
 conserve wildlife.There is a warden   
 employed by the council to look after 
 the wildlife and foresters to manage  
 the woods.People use the woods for    
 walking or jogging,horseriding or to  
 exercise their dogs(but they must be  
 kept on a lead).Visitors can take a   
 picnic to one of the special picnic   
 areas,where there are wooden          
 tables,benches and bins disguised as  
 trees.Some of the rules include no    
 guns,no fires,no litter and no ball   
  games.                               </content>
