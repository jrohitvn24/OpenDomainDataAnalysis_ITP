		<title>13Bellringing in Woodlesford</title>
		<content> Woodlesford All saints Parish Church  
 bellringers belong to the Yorkshire   
 Association of Change ringers. The    
 church has six bells and the ringing  
 chamber can be reached by climbing a  
 stone spiral staircase. The team of   
 bellringers meet on a  monday night   
  for 30 minutes and before the morning
 service begins on Sunday. All the     
 regular members live close to the     
 church. My father has been ringing    
 bells for two years,it took about a   
 year for him to learn because of the  
 more complicated changes.
