		<title>07Communications in Alresford.</title>
		<content> Alresord is well supplied with postal 
 services, a well stocked post office  
 is situated adjacent to the railway   
 line which provides a direct line to  
 the huge sorting office in Colchester,
 which too is next to the station.     
 This situation enables a quick        
 efficient service.                    
  The Post Office provides a country   
 car which is a car that takes letters 
 to small villages and in doing so     
 provides a means of transport for a   
 limited number of people.             
  There are good road connections in   
 and around the area with a main road  
 to Colchester in one direction and    
 Clacton in the other.  Trains link    
 with Clacton and the Colchester town  
 stations.
