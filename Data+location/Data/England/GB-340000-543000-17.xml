		<content>   At the school are two full-time     
 members of staff, one with overall    
 responsibility for the school, and    
 specific responsibility for Juniors   
 (8-11 years), and his assistant, with 
 specific responsibility for Reception 
 and Infants (4-7 years).  Also there  
 is a caretaker, a midday supervisor   
 and there are three cooks. There are  
 also visiting music and remedial      
 teachers.                             
   When children reach secondary school
 age (11) they have to go out of the   
 area to a school at Dalston (6 miles).
   There is a CofE Sunday School (2    
 Catholics attend), held in the church 
 every week, and has about 20 children,
 aged from 2 to 12 years.              
   A playschool meets every week in the
 village hall, for pre-school children 
 (birth-age 4), and has a roll of 15-20
 children.                             </content>
