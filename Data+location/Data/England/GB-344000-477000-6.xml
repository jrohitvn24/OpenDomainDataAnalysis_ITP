 The only primary school is Arnside    
 National School.  Before the 1870     
 Education Act all education in Arnside
 had been by private subscription.  In 
 1886 the{National Society of the      
{Church of England}helped to found     
 Arnside National School for all the   
 children of the village.  That        
 building stands at the top of Briery  
 Bank and is now a Roman Catholic      
 Church.  That building had housed the 
 school until the numbers of children  
 had increased sufficiently to justify 
 the establishment of new premises.  In
 April 1971 a new school was opened in 
 Church Hill. It was designed to       
 accommodate 175 children. At present  
 there are 150 children on roll with   
 6.8 fully qualified teachers. The     
 headmaster is Mr. I.W. Johnston.      </content>
