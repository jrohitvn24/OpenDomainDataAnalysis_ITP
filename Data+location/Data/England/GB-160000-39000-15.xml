		<content> Most of the people who live in our    
 survey area who are in work almost    
 certainly travel out of the area to   
 their employment.They will work for   
 the major employers in the area- the  
 engineering companies or the mines.   
 Those who work in the area in which   
 they live would include the farmers   
 and their employees,those working at  
 the Creamery and anybody from our     
 survey area who works at Camborne     
 School.The employment situation has   
 deteriorated considerably in recent   
 years with the cut backs in Mining    
 Engineering affecting many firms and  
 businesses directly or indirectly.
