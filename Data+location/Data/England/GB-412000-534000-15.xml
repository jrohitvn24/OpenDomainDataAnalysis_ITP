		<title>15A walk to Harperley Park</title>
		<content> Harperley Park is a large area of     
 meadowland surrounded by mainly       
 deciduous trees of all kinds.As the   
 approach roads are private you have to
 walk along public footpaths through   
 fields to reach the wood and the river
 which is the Wear beyond it.          
 We walked through the three fields,   
 one of Barley, one of wheat and one of
 rough grazing land.Also we saw some   
 animals.Part of the woodland meadow   
 had been turned into a corn field.Near
 the rough grazing field there was a   
 beck or small stream.Beside the beck  
 there is a small cottage with three   
 rooms.                                
 The fields are fenced and these are   
 crossed by means of a style or        
 gate.Larks were flying up from one of 
 the fields.                           
 We passed by a small wood of oak,     
 sycamore and rowan trees.             </content>
