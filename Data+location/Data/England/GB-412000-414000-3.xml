		<title>03THE LOCKWOOD AREA</title>
		<content> This area less than eight years ago   
 was the heart of the{Yorkshire textile
 area. Sadly this industry has now     
 declined, due mainly to worldwide     
 competition &amp; general recession.      
                                       
 The once thriving{woollen textile     
{industry}attracted many{Asian families
 into the area where they settled in   
 the relatively low cost housing. The  
 mainly{Moslem &amp; Sikh}members of the   
 community are law abiding{peaceful &amp;  
{religious}by nature.                  
                                       
 Family life and ties are important to 
 them.The children of these families   
 attend the local{Mosques}or the{Sikh  
{temple}at{Spring Grove}often for      
 several hours after school. These     
 children are generally warm, open,    
 friendly and generous.
