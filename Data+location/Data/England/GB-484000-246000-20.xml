		<content>MOST FAMILIES HAVE JOBS OUTSIDE THIS 12
KM. SQUARE ALTHOUGH MANY FARMS ARE     
OWNER OCCUPIED. SOME FARM WORKERS LIVE 
IN THE AREA. THERE IS QUITE A LARGE    
NUMBER OF RETIRED PEOPLE ESPECIALLY IN 
GAYHURST.TO A CERTAIN EXTENT THE THREE 
COMMUNITIES ARE DIVIDED BETWEEN THE NEW
PEOPLE AND THE ESTABLISHED FAMILIES AND
IN THE CASE OF THE FORMER EMPLOYMENT IS
ENTIRELY OUTSIDE THE AREA IN MILTON    
KEYNES,LUTON AND IN A FEW CASES LONDON.
MANY WORK IN HI TECH FIRMS ASSOCIATED  
WITH ELECTRONICS AND COMPUTERS.HOUSE   
PRICES ARE CONSIDERED HIGH AS ARE THE  
LOCAL AUTHORITY RATES AND THERE IS  A  
GREAT DEAL OF RESENTMENT BASED UPON THE
BELIEF RATES ARE SO HIGH TO PAY FOR THE
NEW CITY OF MILTON KEYNES FROM WHICH   
THE 3 VILLAGES RECEIVE NO BENEFIT.THE  
PROBLEM OF UNEMPLOYMENT IS A NATIONAL  
ONE WHICH HAS LITTLE REAL MEANING IN   
THIS COMMUNITY.                        </content>
