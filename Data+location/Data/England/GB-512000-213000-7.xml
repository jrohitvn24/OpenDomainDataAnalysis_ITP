		<title>07Harpenden High St. Shopping</title>
		<content> Wood End pupils sent questionnaires to
 parents in 3 schools and interviewed  
 shoppers in the High St..  We found   
 that the High St. is a friendly       
 meeting place where food shops are    
 considered satisfactory by most.      
 People liked the 3 major supermarkets 
 but regretted the closure of the      
 'corner shop'.  Location &amp; ease of    
 parking affected the choice of        
 supermarket.   Nearby larger shopping 
 centres, with department stores &amp;     
 markets, made housewives think        
 Harpenden clothes shops expensive &amp;   
 limited.   Many didn't know why       
 Anscombes (haberdashers) and          
 Woolworths had to close &amp; would like a
 department store in Harpenden.   Those
 who had lived in Harpenden for 20     
 years or more liked the changes least;
 most did not realise that high rates &amp;
 rent have caused small shops to close.</content>
