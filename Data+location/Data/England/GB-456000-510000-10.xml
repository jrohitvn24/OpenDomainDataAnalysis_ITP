		<title>10Farms in Little Ayton.</title>
		<content> In Little Ayton there are three       
 diffrent farms.{Grange Farm}is owned  
 by Petchs. It used to be a dairy      
 farm,but changed to pigs. It doesn't  
 smell that much but when you go up to 
 the gate to the pigs there is usually 
 a lot of noise.At{Brookside farm}the  
 people keep alot of Tractors and      
 Trailers and other equipment. Last of 
 all is Mr Fletchers Farm{Woodhouse.   
 This farm used to be mixed but is now 
 a dairy farm. The fields are all quite
 big apart from the odd small paddock. 
 There are also four or five stables at
 the dairy farm that have been there   
 for a long time. During the month of  
 June 1985 the{North York Moors        
{National Park Committee}aproved a     
 scheme to develop a lake covering four
 acres at Woodhouse farm Little Ayton  
 for Mr Fletcher.
