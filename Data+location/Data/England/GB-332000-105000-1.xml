		<title>01Overview of the Area</title>
		<content> The village of Tatworth comprises     
 three physically close but quite      
 separate communities - Tatworth       
 itself, South Chard and Perry Street. 
 Community spirit is not always as     
 apparent as in a smaller village      
 because of the large number of        
 inhabitants and the relatively large  
 area covered.                         
                                       
 It comprises a mixture of new and old 
 housing, agriculture and industry,    
 varied religious groups and a primary 
 school. It is well-served by local    
 traders and is situated in a          
 picturesque part of the country,      
 within easy reach of many places of   
 interest and south coast resorts.     
 Communications by road and rail are   
 good.
