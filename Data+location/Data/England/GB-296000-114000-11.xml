		<content> At the present time the farm land is  
 being used by several different       
 farmers. The owners have a sale of    
 grass yearly and the highest bidder   
 can either make hay or silage or run  
 stock on the land he has obtained in  
 the auction. The land is used from    
 March to October. The Link Road,which 
 was completed in 1984, cuts across    
 some of the farmland but does not     
 cause much inconvenience at the       
 moment. However, the owners do intend 
 to farm the land as a whole unit in   
 the near future and then having to    
 travel approximately one kilometre to 
 get to two of their main fields will  
 be time consuming. These fields and   
 two others have also been cut off from
 their natural water supply. The owners
 now have to purchase water from the   
 Water Authority.
