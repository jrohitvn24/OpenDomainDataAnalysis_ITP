		<title>11Camp site workers in Wroxall</title>
		<content>   Wroxall campsite is in Appuldurcombe
 Road.A lot of people go there on      
 holiday.There is a pub,a swimming     
 pool,a shop which sells food and toys 
 and there is a laundrette.Most of all 
 there are the caravans.They are       
 cleaned every day by different people.
 There is room for people to take their
 own tents and camp.I wrote a letter   
 to see if we could ask some people    
 some questions,the manager said" yes" 
 so one playtime we went down there.   
    We found out that 9 people work    
 there,5 part-time and 5 full-time. 4  
 people work there all year.           
  There are two cleaners,1 cleaning    
 supervisor,1 receptionist/secretary   
 and 2 maintenance workers.1 person    
 works at the burger bar.Most people   
 say they like their job because they  
 like working with the campers.
