		<title>17Fruit Picking</title>
		<content> In our area there are 3 main fruit    
 growing farms.One of them is Hadlow   
 Stair Farm.You could pick your own    
 fruit or you could buy the fruit      
 already picked and packed in little   
 plastic cartons covered with          
 cellophane.The farm grew all different
 sorts of fruit.Here is a list of the  
 fruit and the prices.                 
 Gooseberries  25p or 45p.             
 Blackberries  25p or 45p.             
 Loganberries  35p or 40p.             
 The second fruit farm is the          
 College.The people who pick the fruit 
 pick Strawberries,Raspberries and     
 Loganberries.In greenhouses they grow 
 flowers,trees,shrubs and cabbages.My  
 mum works at the College and she picks
 the fruit there.                      
 The third fruit farm grows similar    
 fruit to Hadlow Stair Farm.           
 All three farms grow apples.          </content>
