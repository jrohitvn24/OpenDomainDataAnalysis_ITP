		<content>   THERE ARE FOUR PLACES WHERE FAMILIES
 FROM OUR SCHOOL WORSHIP WITHIN GATLEY 
 VILLAGE CHEADLE. TWO CHRISTIAN MEETING
 HALLS, ST. JAMES CHURCH OF ENGLAND AND
 THE UNITED REFORM CHURCH ON HAWTHORN  
 ROAD.                                 
     CHURCH GOING IS MORE POPULAR THAN 
 WE THOUGHT WITH 56% ATTENDING CHURCH  
 REGULARLY EITHER INSIDE THE VILLAGE OR
 OUT.                                  
   AN EQUAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE WENT TO   
 ST. JAMES AND THE UNITED REFORM       
 CHURCHES. JUST TWO FAMILIES WORSHIPPED
 IN THE MEETING HALLS.                 
   ONE FAMILY WENT TO THE LOCAL MOSQUE,
 ANOTHER WENT TO THE NEAREST ARMENIAN  
 CHURCH AND SOME VISITED THE SYNAGOGUE 
 IN THE AREA TOO. JUST OVER 10% OF THE 
 FAMILIES SURVEYED WENT OUTSIDE THE    
 VILLAGE TO WORSHIP.                   
  44% OF FAMILIES SAID THEY DID NOT    
 ATTEND CHURCH.                        </content>
