		<content> In this square, there is one school,  
 Bestwood Park,the Hawthorne Primary   
 School and nursery.There are 83       
 children on roll, plus 40 children in 
 the nursery.The school numbers will   
 start to rise when the building       
 development behind the school begins  
 to have occupiers.We expect the school
 to have 115 children,plus nursery     
 children in July 1986.                
     The school had 260 children on    
 roll in 1960.We think the numbers have
 gone down because the size of families
 is much smaller, and there are many   
 older people in the village.
