		<title>03Sandhurst/Crowthorne History</title>
		<content>    {Crowthorne }was a place in Windsor
 Forest where three Rides met. The     
 Devil's Highway was a Roman road that 
 linked London with Silchester passing 
 through Crowthorne via Caesars camp   
 and Heath Pool, this route can still  
 be walked today.  In 1819 Crowthorne  
 was not marked on the map but the     
 development of the railway through the
 area caused the establishment of      
 Wellington College and eventually     
 Broadmoor with its accompanying       
 houses.  Today Crowthorne has become  
 an expensive residential area with    
 executive housing developments.The    
 woodland areas of chestnut,birch,pine 
 and rhododendron are National Trust   
 which includes Simons Wood and the    
 Finchampstead Ridges. It is a         
 communter area and although having    
 some very good shops many people look 
 to Bracknell ,Wokingham or Reading.   </content>
