		<title>09SHOPPING CENTRE: BROWNHILLS.</title>
		<content>   The principal planning officer for  
 the Walsall Metropolitan Borough was  
 interviewed on Tuesday, 12th June     
 1985. He was asked about the main     
 objective of the new development in   
 Brownhills.                           
   He said that they were trying to    
 make Brownhills a district shopping   
 centre for the whole of the North East
 Walsall area, including places such   
 as Pelsall, Shelfield and Aldridge.   
 They were also hoping to attract      
 people from the nearby Staffordshire  
 area. As well as a new hypermarket,   
 open market and shops, there would be 
 a DIY superstore and other shops to   
 sell durable goods.                   
   Transport improvements were also to 
 take place to ease congestion in      
 Brownhills High Street. These would   
 include new service roads, traffic    
 islands, and parking facilities.      </content>
