		<title>11WALDRINGFIELD PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content>The only {school} in the area is       
situated at Waldringfield, a small     
village on the South bank of the Deben 
between Woodbridge and Felixstowe      
Ferry. The school was founded in 1874  
by the Reverend Thomas Waller, rector  
of Waldringfield, and has had close    
ties with the Waller family. The school
field was given in later years by      
another member of the family.  Two     
further classrooms and a hall have     
been added to the original building.   
In 1985 there are 40 pupils in two     
classes, Infant and Junior taken by    
the Head Teacher and the assistant.    
This is a sharp contrast to ten years  
ago when the number was 80. The catch- 
ment area consists of Waldringfield,   
and the surrounding villages of        
Newbourne, Henley and Brightwell.      
Most children continue their education 
at Kesgrave High School. Dianne Ninmey.</content>
