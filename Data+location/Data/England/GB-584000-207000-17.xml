		<content>    Heybridge Swifts Football Club were
 formed originally in 1882.For a great 
 majority of that time they played on  
 land owned by{Bentalls.}However in    
 1965 the family firm was taken over by
 a large company called Acrow.They     
 announced intentions to build on the  
 land and intimated to the Swifts that 
 they had to find other playing        
 facilities.Land was purchased in      
 Scraley Road at the cost of Â£750.     
 A clubhouse , changing rooms and more 
 recently, in 1982, floodlights ,have  
 been added  to make the ground one of 
 the best in the county.               
     On the playing side,black and     
 white stripes have been seen on       
 Saturdays in Heybridge for over 100   
 years and the recent acceptance into  
 the Isthmian league should mean that  
 the Swifts should be an important part
 of Heybridge life for years to come.  </content>
