		<content>    The area is in the centre of the   
 Cumberland Farmers' Foxhounds Saturday
 country and both Dentonside Wood and  
 Ninegills are excellent foxholding    
 coverts.                              
    The hounds meet three times a week 
 between September and March and are   
 keenly followed by many local people  
 on foot, on horses and from cars.     
    The River Caldew is a cold river   
 and does not have a very plentiful    
 supply of natural food.  The brown    
 trout are reasonably plentiful and    
 grow to a good size due to the lack of
 competition from numbers.             
    It is a difficult river to fish in 
 this area as it runs through forests  
 and has thickly wooded banks which    
 make casting difficult.               
    However it is a sporting river and 
 much valued by true sporting          
 fishermen.                            </content>
