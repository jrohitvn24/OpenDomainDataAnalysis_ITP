		<content>   We go to school in Shawforth, but   
 our nearest Brownie pack is in        
 Whitworth. In each group there are are
 about six people. We do a wide variety
 of badges. One of the badges is the   
 Agility Badge. To get this you have to
 do hand stands and rolls. There are   
 also badges where you make things, and
 a sewing badge. Some badges you have  
 to do outside, or in the swimming     
 baths. You have a handbook which tells
 you everything to do for badges and   
 everything about Brownies. Our Brownie
 Pack is called 2nd Whitworth.         
   There are twenty people in our Guide
 Company. It is called 1st Whitworth.  
 There are our patrols in the pack:-   
 Kingfisher, Robin, Nightingale and    
 White Rose. There are about fifty     
 badges altogether and some are very   
 hard.
