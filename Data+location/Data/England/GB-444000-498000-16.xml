 shop in Ingleby Arncliffe.Her mother  
 started the shop 48 years ago in her  
 front room.When the shop and post     
 office at Ingleby Cross closed 14     
 years ago,Mr.and Mrs.Rudd took over   
 the P.O. licence and continued to run 
 it as part of their shop in Ingleby   
 Arncliffe.However the post office has 
 retained the name 'Ingleby Cross' and 
 this can be seen on the sign outside. 
 Mr. Hodgson is a carpenter and        
 woodcarver who owns a workshop and    
 showroom at Ingleby Cross. He lives in
 Middlesbrough and has worked here for

 of wood to make articles such as      
 garden seats, tables, babies cradles, 
 plates and egg-timers.A high          
 proportion of his work is made to     
 order.
