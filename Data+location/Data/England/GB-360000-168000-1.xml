		<title>01An overview of our area</title>
		<content> Ours is an area of contrasts.         
{Brislington}for example has traces of 
 an old settlement - even back to Roman
 times. It still possesses its ancient 
 parish church and an old engine house 
 from early mining days.{Knowle West}  
 has grown up largely between the World
 Wars as inner city slum areas were    
 cleared.{Whitchurch}however, is       
 largely postwar and as Bristolians    
 move ever outwards from the city,     
 large housing estates seem to expand  
 yearly. An area of farms and          
 woodland, once with a pre-war air     
 strip between the meadows is now being
 replaced by new estates, shopping     
 complexes, super stores, sports areas 
 and, above all, a network of main     
 arterial roads linking these commuter 
 areas with the great city of Bristol.
