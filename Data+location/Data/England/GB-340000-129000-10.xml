		<title>10CHILDREN'S PARTY, HIGH HAM</title>
		<content> There has been an annual children's   
 party in High Ham village hall for    
 about 40 years. Originally this was   
 organised as a Christmas party by the 
 British Legion and held the first     
 Saturday in January with Father       
 Christmas attending. Later the Women's
 Institute joined the British Legion in
 putting on this party. Nowadays it is 
 organised by the village with money   
 donated by both these organisations.  
 It is no longer a Christmas party, as 
 this is such a busy time of the year, 
 but has been moved to February,thought
 to be a dull month after all the      
 excitement of Christmas and the New   
 Year. It is for all children up to the
 age of 16 living in the parish. A     
 party tea is laid on, with games and  
 an entertainment, such as a conjurer. 
 Staff from the village school and the 
 Vicar also attend.                    </content>
