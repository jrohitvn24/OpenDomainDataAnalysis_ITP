 was New Anzac on Sea. His land was    
 reclaimed for crop growing during the 
 First World War,but after the War     
 Neville held another competition and  
 this time the chosen name was

 clubs.In 1921 a house ready for occup-
 ation cost Â£300 and 600 houses were   
 built in 6 months. M.Prust&amp;M.Vaesen   </content>
