		<title>06Village Hall, N. Lopham</title>
		<content>      The village hall stands on the   
 left hand side of the road going to   
 South Lopham.  There is a football    
 pitch there.  The village hall is used
 for discoes, mother and toddler group,
 pop group, annual village fete, clay  
 pigeon shooting, football and others. 
 The village hall has been standing    
 since 1931.  The South Lopham people  
 hadn't liked the North Lopham people, 
 but they joined together to build the 
 hall to share between the villages.   
                                       
      The village hall is placed rather
 dangerously, because people who want  
 to bike to it have to bike down a     
 heavily used bit of road.  When the   
 children from school have to go to the
 hall they have to walk down the road. 
 However plans are being made for an   
 adventure play ground, B.M.X. track   
 and quarter pipe.                     </content>
