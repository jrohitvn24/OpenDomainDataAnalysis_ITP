		<content>{BILL HAMILTON.}Today, as Home Affairs 
 Correspondent of B.B.C. T.V. News, I  
 have just visited Holloway Prison in  
 London. This is just one of many jails
 which are totally overcrowded and     
 holding over 4,800 inmates. From St.  
 Albans, I travel around the country   
 reporting on Law and Order issues, as 
 well as immigration, race relations   
 and a problem which is fast emerging  
 as the scourge of the decade, the     
 number of young people who've sadly   
 become addicted to hard drugs.        
{P.C. BROWN.}P.C. Brown is a community}
 police officer for Jersey Farm and    
 Marshalswick. He works 2 shifts from  
 8a.m. to 4p.m. and from 4p.m. to      
 midnight. He has a variety of duties  
 including visiting homes, schools and 
 the shopping areas to talk to people  
 to see if they have any problems. He  
 has also trained police dogs.         </content>
