		<content>    When it's not school I get up at   
 half nine, but some times I get up at 
 eight because I go with my brother on 
 his{paper-round.}We take our dog      
 aswell. When we get back I have       
 something to eat like{toast}or        
{Weetobix,}when everyone in my family  
 has had somthing to eat, some one gets
 the pots to wash up. When everything  
 is clean I go out to play or go       
 shopping with my mum.                 
                                       
     When we get our shopping done we  
 go home and then I play out. On a hot 
 day and it there's nothing to do I    
 play on my{roller-boots.}On Sunday we 
 have a big dinner and then we clean up
 again. I go and play out again for an 
 hour or till its time for tea. In the 
 evening I like to watch{television.
