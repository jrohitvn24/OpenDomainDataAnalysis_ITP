		<content>  This quite shocking cold and wet     
 summer has shown up Peterborough in   
 the best possible light. There are so 
 many aspects to the city since the    
 expansion programme got under way that
 we've come to take them for granted - 
 the roads, Queensgate, the leisure    
 facilities, all the houses,  the      
 thousands of new jobs, Nene Park and  
 all the rest of it. But as I drove    
 back into the city after my holiday I 
 was struck by the quite dazzling      
 landscaping effect - helped by all the
 rain - which the Development Corpora- 
 tion has achieved. All the trees and  
 shrubs and flowers have really made   
 the city a quite beautiful place to   
 look at. And, of course, it will get  
 better as the years roll by. The      
 landscaping is a superb example of    
 careful and thoughtful planning at its
 very best.            {John Harper-Tee</content>
