		<title>04LONGSTONE PRE-SCHOOL GROUP</title>
		<content> In l984 parents of children of        
 pre-school age came together to form  
 the {Great Longstone Area Under Fives 
{Group}which aims, through play and    
 constructive activity, to help the    
 development of young children both    
 physically and emotionally and to     
 prepare them for entry into school.   
 It is run by volunteers and because   
 parents are actively involved, the    
  Group also provides a means of       
 social contact in the community.      
 In order to be able to offer the      
 children a more stimulating           
 environment, the Group is currently   
 engaged on a project to renovate the  
 old infant's building at the School as
 a meeting place specially designed for
 the use of pre-school children to     
 replace the present temporary         
 accommodation.This will cost Â£4000 and
 has involved much fund raising.       </content>
