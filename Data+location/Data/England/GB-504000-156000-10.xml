		<content> The local farming is mixed: beef and  
 dairy cattle, root crops, silage,     
 sweet corn and other market garden    
 produce. There are few cereals and few
 or no sheep. Some Ockham farms have   
 been fragmented or sold for paddock   
 and riding stables and some for market
 gardening with agricultural buildings 
 sold separately as residences. Ugly   
 prefabricated farm buildings escape   
 planning controls. Some former farms  
 have become managed estates for rough 
 shooting:-pheasant and partridge. The 
 Wisley farmland is now horticultural  
 in the RHS garden (see Special        
 Feature). Pyrford and Ripley still    
 have some farms, thanks to the the    
 Green Belt policy, for the land usage 
 is under pressure with London only 30 
 miles away.
