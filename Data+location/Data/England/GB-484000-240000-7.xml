		<content> Breakdancing is a new kind of dancing.
 It started in about 1980-81. There are
 lots of different moves and some of   
 them are very difficult. They have    
 weird names like the 'Windmill','Crazy
 Legs'and the'Turtle'. You get special 
 music to breakdance to and it has a   
 good beat. The music is mostly        
 produced from an electronic           
 synthesiser. Ordinary dancing is      
 normally done on the feet using       
 different moves but staying with your 
 weight on your feet. Breakdancing     
 though, is a completely different     
 matter. It is mostly done on the floor
 distributing the weight onto different
 parts of the body.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
