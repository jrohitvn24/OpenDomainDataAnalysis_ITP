{Establishment}was established near the
 beginning of the century to study the 
 cause and prevention of explosion in  
 mines and how to prevent them. Today  
 it is still concened with explosions  
 and was recently featured on BBC TV   
 demonstrating the potentially         
 explosive properties of custard       
 powder!                               
 During the war the limestone hills    
 provided safe storage place for RAF   
 bombs. The caves made for them were   
 used by a {Mushroom Farm}in the 1960s.
 Today {Stowtime}occupy them. The cool 
 dark condiions provide an ideal place 
 to store wine, cheese and other foods.
{Sheffield University}have nuclear     
 research laboratories nearby in the   
 site of the old Harper Hill Limeworks.
