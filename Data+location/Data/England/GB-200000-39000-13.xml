		<title>13A Day in the life of Chris</title>
		<content> I usually get up at about 7.15a.m.,I  
 get dressed and have breakfast - Rice 
 Krispies,Shredded Wheat,or Frosties,  
 sometimes I also have toast.I watch   
 T.V. until Dad gets up and tells me to
 go outside,because my two sisters are 
 already out.I usually go and knock for
 Paul - he sometimes invites me in,but 
 normally we go off on our bikes or    
 play French cricket.Eventually the    
 ball hits a window and we get told to 
 play elsewhere!Then it is time for    
 lunch,I have sausages,chips and beans.
 After lunch I sometimes go to the     
 beach - if it is high tide I go       
 fishing.At about 6 o'clock I have tea 
 - bread and butter,jam,and home made  
 cakes.Sometimes,after tea I play out. 
 Then I watch T.V. until bedtime at    
 about 8.45p.m..That is an average in  
 the life of me - Christopher Wood of  
 Gorran Haven.                         </content>
