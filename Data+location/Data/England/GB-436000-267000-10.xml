		<title>10BRIDGE BARN FARM.</title>
		<content> Mr Brown is a tenant of the farm which
 is owned by Warwickshire County       
 Council.His farm covers aproximately  
 93 acres.Mr and Mrs Brown work on the 
 farm and they have no employees so    
 they have no wages bill.They live on  
 the farm.Their main commodity is milk.
 They also produce beef and corn.They  
 have 47 pedigree{Jersey}cows and keep 
 112 beef cattle that are{Angus Cross}.
 Mr Brown doesnt want any changes to   
 the farm.For Channel Island milk he is
 paid 18p per litre.A new tractor would
 cost Â£10,000 and a large one Â£50,000. 
 All the cows are home bred.Mr Brown   
 chose Jersey cows because he'd worked 
 with them all his life.A cow in milk  
 costs Â£400.For a pedigree bull it     
 would cost Â£8_900 but Mr Brown doesn't
 keep a bull.
