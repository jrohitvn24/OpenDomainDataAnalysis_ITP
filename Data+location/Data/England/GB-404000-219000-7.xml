		<title>07ALL SAINTS' CHURCH,SALPERTON</title>
		<content> The church is set on raised ground to 
 the S of the Manor House and          
 churchgoers have to cross the front of
 the mansion to reach the old rusty    
 gate and stone steps which lead up to 
 the churchyard.Some interesting       
 Tabletombs can be seen here and one or
 two have tall iron railings around the
 graves. The church has a Perpendicular
 Tower with noteworthy gargoyles,one of
 which is 'Eve' with the apple in her  
 open mouth.The Tower clock dated 1659 
 has no hands.Inside there is seating  
 for about 70 people.Services are held 
 alternate Sundays.On the west wall    
 there is a painting of a skeleton     
 holding an arrow and scythe,probably  
 'Father Time'.
