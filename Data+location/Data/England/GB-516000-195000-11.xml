		<title>11HERTSMERE'S COAT-OF-ARMS</title>
		<content> Granted in 1975, Hertsmere's coat-of- 
 arms reflects the diversity of the    
 Borough. On the shield the hart of    
 Hertfordshire surmounts a battlemented
 wall with a raised portcullis denoting
 the open gateway to London, but also  
 reminding of a commitment to the      
 protection of local amenities. Above  
 the civic helmet is the crest of      
 another hart resting its hoof on a    
 reel of cine-film (for the Borehamwood
 studios): behind is an oak tree for   
 Tidwulf's tree (the origin of         
 Elstree). The shield's supporters are 
 also harts, but each is emblazoned on 
 the shoulder with (left) an artist's  
 palette for Bushey to the west, and   
 (right) with a potter's wheel for     
 Potters Bar in the east. The motto is 
 taken from that of the former Elstree 
 Rural District Council - "Do Well and 
 Fear Not".                            </content>
