		<content> There is a strong tradition of music  
 in our area, in particular brass      
 bands. They date from around 1800, but
 the oldest is Holme Brass Band.  It   
 was originally led by Fenton Renshaw  
 and gained several first prizes.      
 There was much rivalry between the    
 local bands and it was quite common   
 for each to hold a contest of its own.
 Holme Brass Band is presently known as
 Holme Silver Band which meets on      
 Wednesdays and Sundays just outside   
 the village of Holme. The Band Room   
 has been extended and caters for      
 visiting local bands.                 
 Today many local people are associated
 with the band and children in local   
 primary and secondary schools are     
 encouraged to take up musical         
 instruments, continuing the local     
 tradition. Musical interest in schools
 led to formation of Holme Valley Choir</content>
