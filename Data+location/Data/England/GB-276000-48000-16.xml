		<content> Devon is a lovely place for flowers.  
 We went on a twenty minute walk up    
 the road from school in July.We found 
 thirty_five different varieties of    
 wild flowers.The most common flowers  
 were naval_wort,common catsear, fox   
 gloves,cow parsley,pink campion.If our
 walk had been in May we would have    
 seen a lot of blue_bells and primroses
 for which Devon is famous.Our fields  
 in Devon are surrounded by high mounds
 of earth in which all of these and    
 many others grow Among the flowers we 
 found hogweed,bramble,wild
