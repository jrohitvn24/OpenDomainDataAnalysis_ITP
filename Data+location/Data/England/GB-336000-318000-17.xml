		<content> The toilets, buckets surrounded by    
 wooden casing, were across the yard   
 and emptied and disinfected once a    
 week by the caretaker.  The houses had
 no electricity.  Paraffin lamps and   
 candles were used for lighting. Where 
 I lived no water was laid on, just a  
 raintub and pump in the garden. You   
 had to heat all your water on the fire
 or Primus stove for a bath once a week
 in a large galvanised bath, in front  
 of the fire in winter and outside in  
 the shed in summer. There were no     
 drains to pour your water down, you   
 had to dig a culvert and let it soak  
 away.  It was the same in most        
 places.
