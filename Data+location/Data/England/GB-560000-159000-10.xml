     Wrotham church is the second      
 church to be built on the site.The    
 first church was built in the 10th    
 century.The present building dates    
 from the 13th century and is          
 approximately 700 years old.This      
 church was named after the patron     
 saint of England.The bells were       
 installed over 200 years ago and cost 
 over Â£300 which was a lot of money in 
 those  days.The brass eagle was       
 installed in 1879.On the front of the 
 pulpit is an angel which represents an
 18 year old girl who was murdered on  
 the hills in Wrotham.                 
     Wrotham has a population of about 
 2000 people but the size of the       
 congregation is only just over 50 at  
 the Sunday morning service.They hold  
 _about 12 weddings a year at the most 
 and 35 christenings.                  </content>
