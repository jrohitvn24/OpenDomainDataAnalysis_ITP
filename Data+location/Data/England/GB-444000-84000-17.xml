		<title>17"Bowcombe"-Recreation.</title>
		<content>   Not surprisingly, field sports      
 figure largely in the leisure         
 activities of most of those in the    
 area involved in farming, though it   
 became clear that most of the farmers 
 worked long hours, which left little  
 time for hobbies or pastimes. Indeed, 
 as one pointed out; shooting vermin   
 such as pigeons and rabbits is really 
 one of the less arduous aspects of the
 job. The demands upon a busy farmer's 
 wife too are perhaps greater than     
 those upon a normal housewife.        
   To others in the area, and to other 
 Islanders and tourists, Bowcombe is a 
 picturesque area for walking with many
 well sign-posted paths crossing it.   
 One in particular; the Tennyson Trail,
 so called after the famous poet who   
 lived at nearbye Mottistone, forms a  
 part of one of the most attractive and
 scenic walks on the Island.           </content>
