		<content> Most homes in the villages of         
 Aysgarth, Thoralby and West Burton    
 have mains water, sewage, electricity 
 and a telephone. There is no piped gas
 in this area, as it is too remote. All
 three villages have a village shop and
 post office and there is a butcher's  
 shop in West Burton. In Aysgarth there
 are one or two craft and specialist   
 shops, eg a wine and cheese shop and a
 clog-maker.  All the villages have a  
 public house serving food and offering
 bed and breakfast accommodation. Most 
 people not employed in tourism or     
 farming work outside the villages,    
 some travelling as far as Darlington &amp;
 Northallerton to work. A car is an    
 essential for any family, as the one  
 bus service has been reduced to 2     
 buses daily and the railway station at
 Aysgarth closed in the 1950's.
