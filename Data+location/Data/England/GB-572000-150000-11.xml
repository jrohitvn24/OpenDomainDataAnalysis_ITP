		<title>11Farming in the Coxheath area</title>
		<content> There are many farming activities in  
 the area (see also page 13).          
                                       
{Nursery -}The Mid-Kent Garden Service}
 is a small nursery.  Trees, shrubs,   
 potted and garden plants are grown.   
 Some plants are sold for use in show  
 houses and for exhibition stands at   
 the Kent County Show.                 
                                       
{Coppice -}Sweet Chestnut trees are    
 grown for coppicing.  The trees grow  
 for about fourteen years.  They are   
 then cut for poles and fencing.       
                                       
{Rabbits -}Rabbits are reared in a     
 large shed at West Farleigh.  There   
 are about fifty New Zealand white does
 each producing about 45 young per     
 year.  The meat is sold to            
 supermarkets and the fur used for hats
 etc.                                  </content>
