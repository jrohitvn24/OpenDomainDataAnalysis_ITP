		<content> Recently there has been oilseed rape  
 growing beside a favourite path. After
 the brilliant yellow faded, the seed  
 pods turned the field a soft green.   
 At harvest time there was a lot of    
 rain and the farmer could not start to
 harvest it. He became very concerned  
 as it began to blacken and the seeds  
 shoot out of their pods. On the first 
 possible day, the team worked by      
 headlights till four o'clock in the   
 morning to get the crop in. This was  
 necessary as there are now so few men 
 employed on the farm that there were  
 not enough staff to make a second     
 shift; one was needed to mind the     
 drier and another to drive the crop   
 over to the collecting centre.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
