  Cannock has a number of local free   
newspapers which are delivered free of 
charge to every household in the       
district. These newspapers are a useful
source of information for the local    
inhabitants and provide ample          
advertising space for local traders.   
It is also possiable to sell items in  
the classified columns free of charge  
if the price is under 20 pounds.       
  There a number of video rental shops 
in the area and for a small fee anyone 
can become a member and hire films for 
a very reasonable price. Videos have   
become increasingly popular over the   
years in Cannock and in a recent survey
of Sherbrook school children over      
2/3rds had access to a video recorder.
