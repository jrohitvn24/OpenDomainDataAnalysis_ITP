		<content> On Saturdays I get up about nine      
 o'clock,wash,dress and have my        
 breakfast.I have Special K,toast and  
 marmalade and a cup of tea.Then I     
 check my hamster and rabbit to see if 
 they have enough food and water.I     
 switch the television on and watch    
 Saturday Morning Picture Show or No.73
 if its on.Then I might play football  
 on my own and it will soon be         
 dinnertime.For dinner I have a snack -
 sandwiches,crisps,a mousse and a Wispa
 bar.                                  
 In the afternoon I clean out my       
 hamster and rabbit.Then I go up to my 
 friend's and we play football,cricket 
 or badminton.I am up there a long time
 and when I get back I have my tea.    
 Another boy I know rings his friend   
 and they play with their catapults or 
 on their bikes.They catapult tins and 
 lamposts and ricochet stones.         </content>
