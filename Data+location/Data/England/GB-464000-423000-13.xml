 The"Oddfellows"pub in Carlton has     
 a ghost! The landlord said it was a   
 figure dressed as a cavalier. The     
 landlady has never sensed it. However 
 when the landlord and landlady were on
 holiday their friends looked ater the 
 pub. Their dog barked every time it   
 went into their bedroom, and when     
 Mr.and Mrs.X went to bed they got the 
 feeling of someone lifting up the     
 mattress. They are convinced it was   
 the ghost                             
 The landlord's sister-in-law sensed it
 too. She was upstairs alone watching  
 TV. She went downstairs and when she  
 came back the TV was off. There was   
 no_else else upstairs. Apparently the 
 pub was built in l75O on the site of  
 some some stables where a man had     
 committed suicide. Ever since there   
 have been ghostly tales!              </content>
