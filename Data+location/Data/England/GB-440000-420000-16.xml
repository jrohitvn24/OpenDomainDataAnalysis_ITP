		<title>16Trade in Featherstone</title>
		<content> The shopping facilities in            
 Featherstone consist of one small main
 shopping street of about 60 shops and 
 a market on a Thursday of about 30    
 stalls with general stores situated in
 the outskirts.With the exeption of    
 stalls specialising in wet fish,eggs  
 and men's jeans all the stalls        
 duplicate the shops.There are two     
 supermarkets and plans have been put  
 forward to build a third.One can buy  
 the whole range of consumer goods but 
 there is no choice with regards to the
 larger items such as furniture.People 
 in North Featherstone very rarely go  
 into the town prefering to shop for   
 fresh foods at local stores and travel
 to towns close by for other goods.    
 Those living closer to town do use it 
 more for food but still travel for non
 food items.The generla opinion being  
 that shopping facilities are poor.    </content>
