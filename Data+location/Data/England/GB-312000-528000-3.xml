		<title>03Sports Centre - Cockermouth</title>
		<content> Opened in 1978 by Princess Alexander, 
 the Centre now comprises a 25m by 8m  
 swimming pool and faclities for indoor
 cricket, keep-fit classes, volleyball,
 weight training with a multi-gym,     
 solarium and a sauna. Before the      
 Centre was opened public sports       
 facities were very limited.           
 Improvements planned include an       
 all-weather pitch for football,       
 netball, basketball and hockey. The   
 swimming pool was built as a result of
 intensive fund-raising by Cockermouth 
 people over several years. Allerdale  
 District Council built the pool with a
 grant from the Sports Council and     
 money given by the Cockermouth        
 Swimming Pool Association.            
 The C.S.P.A. formed the nucleus for   
 the successful Cockermouth Swimming   
 Club which competes both locally and  
 nationally.                           </content>
