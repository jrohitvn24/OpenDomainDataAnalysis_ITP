		<content>  The land throughout this area is     
 gently undulating, and a main feature 
 of the{landscape}is fields containing 
 crops.A full variety of cereal crops  
 is grown and because of intensive crop
 rotation the appearance of the fields 
 regularly changes.The number of       
 landowners in the area is few as large
 acreages are farmed as one unit.      
 Passing through the centre of the     
{landscape}is the River Nar which has  
 it's source nearby.At one point in the
 area a man made lake has been formed  
 from the river.Much{housing}is quite  
 old and flint construction is a       
 regularly observed feature.There are  
 two types of{religion}represented in  
 the area by a chapel and a church     
 dating from{Saxon}times.
