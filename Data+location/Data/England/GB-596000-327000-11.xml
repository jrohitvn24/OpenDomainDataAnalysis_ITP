		<content> My name is Paul and I live in Guist.  
 I wake up at six o'clock, get dressed,
 wash, and then get on with my         
 homework.  When Mum comes down she    
 asks what I want for breakfast and I  
 say, 'Weetabix'.                      
 When it is eight o'clock I go down the
 the lay-by to play with my friends and
 wait for the school bus.  First the   
 Fakenham bus comes, and then ours, and
 we pick up the Wood Norton and        
 Stibbard children on the way.         
 When the school whistle goes at 9.00  
 a.m we line up and go into the        
 classroom and get on straight away    
 with some Mathematics.  We have a     
 break at 10.40 and morning school ends
 at 12.00 noon.  We eat our sandwiches 
 in the hall and play outside until the
 afternoon session which lasts from    
 1.30 p.m. until 3.25 p.m. when the    
 school bus takes us home again.       </content>
