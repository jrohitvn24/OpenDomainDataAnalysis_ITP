		<title>02Melling and Arkholme. Cont..</title>
		<content>   Each village has an old Primary     
school, Melling with a headmistress    
and a headmaster in Arkholme. There    
have been new classrooms and a kitchen 
built on in Melling in the last twenty 
years but Arkholme is still waiting    
for some more modernisation.           
   Many of the inhabitants of both the 
villages are not local born people.They
have moved here for a pleasant         
lifestyle while they work in towns or  
they have retired here.                
   There is a garage /petrol station in
both villages and a shop/ post office  
in Arkholme. Melling has no shop at all
other than the garage. A railway bridge
crosses the river but the stations are 
closed.Carnforth is the nearest one to 
Arkholme and Wennington for Melling on 
the Yorkshire line.                    
   The R.Lune provides abundantly for  
salmon fishing and bird watching.      </content>
