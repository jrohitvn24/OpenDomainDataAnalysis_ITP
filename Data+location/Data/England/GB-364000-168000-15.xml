		<content> Bitton station is between Bristol     
 and Bath.The railway line there was   
 formerly owned and managed by the     
 Midland Railway Company.In 1803 they  
 put forward plans but the line was not
 opened until 1869.Just over 100years  
 later British Rail closed the line and
 lifted the track.1973 a few people    
 formed the Bristol Suburban Railway   
 Society.Since then they have layed 1.5
 miles of track and acquired and       
 restored a number of steam and diesel 
 locomotives.                          
      The three main loco builders in  
 Bristol were Fox Walker,Avonside and  
 Peckett and Co.The BSRS currently has 
 one of each company's loco.Their most 
 recent project has been to preserve   
 "Littleton No5"their 5th loco,built in
 Leeds.It should be steamed in         
 Sept.'85.          by Chris Nichols
