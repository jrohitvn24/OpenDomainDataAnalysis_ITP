		<title>02HOME LIFE -ONE</title>
		<content> In a questionnaire that we delivered  
 to houses in our area we asked certain
 questions about peoples home life.    
   Concerning the use of telephones of 
 those who replied nearly two-thirds   
 have one telephone.One-sixth of houses
 in our area still have no             
 telephone.There are just a few houses 
 with more than one telephone.We found 
 out that there were more colour       
 televisions in homes than black and   
 white but it was a suprise to us      
 between the number of b/w T.V.s       
 compared to colour.The reason for this
 is that we think that most people have
 more than one T.V. in the house.The   
 extra T.V. is usually a black and     
 white portable, the T.V. being colour 
 and  it would be located in main      
 family room of the house .            
                                       
                                       </content>
