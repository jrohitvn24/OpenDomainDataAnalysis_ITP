		<content> In Compton we have old houses and new 
 houses,some of the oldest houses      
 dating back to King Henry the Eigth.  
 Many of the newer houses were built   
 only about two or three years ago.    
 There are council houses,privately    
 owned houses and some are owned by the
 bigger farms and the Agricutural Food 
 Research Centre.                      
     Most people live in in two storey 
 houses,though there are also a number 
 of bungalows,cottages and flats.      
   No people from our school live in   
 flats or terraced houses.Majority of  
 people live in semi-detached while a  
 few live in detached houses.
