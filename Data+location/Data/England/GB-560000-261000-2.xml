		<content>Racing Stables: There are two racing   
stables in this area and these provide 
employment for a good many people.     
Valuable horses have to be well looked 
after by people who understand them and
they must be properly trained to race. 
"Strings" of horses are often          
encountered in the early mornings and  
and traffic is expected to give way to 
them as they make their way to the     
Heath.  The followers of racing take a 
great interest in a locally trained    
horse.                                 
Stud Farms: There are three stud farms 
in this area concerned with the        
commercial breeding of horses.         
They always look very well-kept with   
well maintained fences and trees for   
shelter and shade.
