 more than one{relation}in the area.   
 Time was spent regularly visiting     
 other members of the{family.}A great  
 deal of{television}is watched by the  
 whole family, around five hours for   
 children and seven hours for adults   
 per day being quite normal. Most      
 families have{pets.}These and hobbies 
 took up much of the children's sspare 
 time.                                 
      Most families interviewed had the
 usual{labour saving devices}such s    
 automatic washers, vacuum cleaners    
 etc., and most had a car.             
      Many of the families interviewed 
 in the area had a{mother working}but  
 few thought this caused problems.     
 Being a part of a family and being    
 loved by them was seen as being most  
 important.                            </content>
