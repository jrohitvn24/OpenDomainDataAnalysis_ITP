		<content>   This,he feels,has created a conflict
 of interests between himself and the  
 'newcomers'.As a farmer he feels      
 people moving to a rural area for     
 peace and a less restricted way of    
 life should appreciate that the land  
 around them is the site and source of 
 a commercial enterprise and investment
 (just as a factory site would be      
 thought of in an urban area).Nagging  
 complaints about footpath blockages,  
 mud on the road and early morning     
 noisy milking machinery are constant  
 irritants in this farmer's life and   
 isolate him from what should be his   
 own community.                        
   The only village event of the year  
 is the 'harvest supper',a somewhat    
 false and stilted affair in the eyes  
 of this man,where the ageing and non- 
 farming inhabitants attempt to        
 recreate the togetherness of the past.</content>
