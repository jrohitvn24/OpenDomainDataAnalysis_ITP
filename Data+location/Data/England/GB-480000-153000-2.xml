		<title>02PRESENT DAY FLEET</title>
		<content> Fleet is a modern town which did not  
 exist before the Railway Station was  
 built.                                
 The town possesses a new civic centre 
 and new administrative offices are    
 being built. There is a good shopping 
 centre with many small family concerns
 and a Saturday market. On the         
 outskirts is a small light industrial 
 estate.  Many new housing developments
 are taking place because of the easy  
{access to London.}At least four       
 different companies have purchased    
 land along the road between Fleet and 
 Cove and there is worry about the{loss
{of open space.}Within the town there  
 are very many amenities for the public
 to enjoy; football, cricket, hockey,  
 tennis and golf are all well catered  
 for although the town does lack a     
 swimming pool.{Churches}of most       
 denominations exist here.             </content>
