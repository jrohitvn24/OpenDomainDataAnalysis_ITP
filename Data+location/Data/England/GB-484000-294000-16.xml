		<title>16Aspects of Lyddington</title>
		<content> There is no school in Lyddington,at 5 
 years children go to school by bus to 
 Uppingham,some to private schools in  
 the area.The old school building is   
 now the village hall and is used by a 
 preschool playgroup 5 mornings a week.
 There is a committee which run the    
 village hall.The old Reading Room     
 which was owned by the village was    
 sold recently to finance a playing    
 field,this seemed to cause some ill   
 feeling between the old and new vill- 
 agers.A bus service operates twice a  
 week to Corby and most shopping is    
 done there or Uppingham.A Mobile      
 Library calls once a month.There are 2
 Building firms and an Electrician and 
 apart from the farms no employment for
 young people.There is no provision for
 elderly people when they become infirm
 so they are accommodated in nearby    
 towns.                                </content>
