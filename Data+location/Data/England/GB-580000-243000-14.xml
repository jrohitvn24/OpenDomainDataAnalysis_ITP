		<content>   To practise road safety Mr Finch    
 took us to Long Melford on our bikes. 
 At the huge church was a replica of   
 the{Bayeux Tapestry}50m long, the     
 first time it has been seen in England
   The frieze shows King Edward sending
 Harold to nominate Duke William as his
 successor, and Harold's adventures.   
 The king's funeral scene is in the    
 wrong order! Why did Harold break his 
 oath and take the crown?  I liked the 
{invasion}scenes and the banquet and   
 the battle.  Bishop Odo ought not to  
 fight but he has a big club. The last 
 two scenes are a Norman cavalry charge
 and the English{retreat. }            
   They say the last scene was Harold's
 coronation and it has been lost. Mrs  
 Finch says it's really{embroidery,}not
 tapestry, but it's a fantastic piece  
 of work. I wish poor Harold had       
 been able to put his point of view.   </content>
