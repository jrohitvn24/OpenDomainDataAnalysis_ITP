		<content> Mrs Katrina Hodkin was walking along a
 well defined footpath on 30 June 1985 
 with 9 year old Elizabeth Watters and 
 Alexander, Mrs Hodkin's 9 year old    
 son. They had a dog with them that was
 properly leashed. About 18 cows       
 surrounded the party one of which     
 knocked Mrs Hodkin to the ground. She 
 tried to get up but was again knocked 
 down and trampled on. In the meantime 
 an identical thing happened to        
 Elizabeth. Alexander had managed to   
 escape to the boundary fence. Both Mrs
 Hodkin and Elizabeth were badly cut   
 and bruised and needed medical        
 attention. During the incident Mrs    
 Hodkin had wondered whether she would 
 get away with her life! The beasts    
 were Hereford cross Fresian cows with 
 Charolais cross calves. The local     
 farmer blamed the presence of the dog 
 for the incident.                     </content>
