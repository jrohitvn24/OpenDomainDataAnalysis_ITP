		<content> The{Cubs}are a group formed in 1908.  
 The Hollingworth Cubs meet on Tuesday 
 night at 6.45 and finish at 8.15. The 
 pack is divided into sixes led by a   
 sixer and a seconder. We begin with a{
{Grand Howl}and afterwards play games. 
 On dry nights we go out to play       
 rounders and other games. We also take
 badges; three of these are called     
 Arrows - Bronze, Silver and Gold.     
 There are Interest Badges like First  
 Aid, Collector, Athlete and Home Help.
{Horseriding}In my spare time I go     
 up to the farm to ride my horse{Misty.
 He is 24 years old which is old for a 
 horse. In summer he stays out in the  
 field and I don't have to muck out his
 stable. My horse has just been{shod;  
 he lost all his shoes in the field.   
 I take him to the{Pony Club}to watch  
 other riders. I don't ride because I'm
 not good enough yet.                  </content>
