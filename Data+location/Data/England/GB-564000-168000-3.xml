		<content>{St. Mary Magdalene Church}was thought 
 to be built around 1100 A.D.The Church
 is very famous for it's many brasses, 
 many people come to do brass rubbings.
 The stained glass windows are very    
 attractive although only 100 years    
 old.The table tomb at the top end of  
 the Church has statues of Lord Cobham 
 and his wife.Also smaller figures of  
 his ten sons and four daughters are   
 around the tomb.The Lord De Cobham    
 family were responsible for building  
 much of the church and doing many     
 repairs.The font is placed in the     
 center of the tower,the circular shaft
 is of late Norman times.The Church    
 contains many pews for people to sit  
 on during the church service.There are
 six bells,four of which go back to the
 17th Century.
