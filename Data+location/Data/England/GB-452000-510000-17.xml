		<title>17SOCIAL CONCERNS OF GT AYTON</title>
		<content> On Guisborough Road, alongside the    
 cemetary, is Yatton House, a day      
 centre to provide work for mentally   
 handicapped young adults.  It is      
 funded partly by the Social Services  
 and partly by charity.                
                                       
 Holly Garth and Beech Close, off the  
 High Street, provides sheltered       
 accommodation for old people.  They   
 comprise houses to allow independent  
 living but linked by phone to a full  
 time nurse-warden.  Costs are met by  
 the Social Services.  Village         
 schoolchildren visit by arrangement.  
                                       
 Ayton has links with a village called 
 Sambel Kunda in the Gambia.  Money for
 wells, fertilisers and crops has been 
 sent to this Third World country.
