		<title>10ALL ABOUT ME</title>
		<content>   My name is Sarah.  I am nine years  
 old.  I live at 37,Harewood Crescent. 
 I go to Oakworth First School and next
 year will go to Bronte Middle School. 
 I have lots to do after school.  On   
 Monday I go to swimming lessons, on   
 Tuesday, dancing lessons, Brownies on 
 Wednesday and Joy Club on Friday.  My 
 favourite television programmes are   
 Dallas and Top of the Pops.  I        
 collect fancy rubbers and posters.    
 First thing in the morning I find it  
 hard to wake up.  When I finally get  
 up I dress and get my things ready for
 school.  At school we usually read.   
 After reading we either do Maths,     
 English or Art and Craft and then we  
 have assembly.  When we go home I     
 watch television and sometimes go out 
 for tea.  I go to bed between 9.00p.m.
 and 10.30p.m.
