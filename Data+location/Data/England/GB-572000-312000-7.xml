		<content>  The farming in this area is mostly   
 arable, i.e. Barley, Wheat, Sugar beet
 and potatoes.{The villages of Pentney 
{and Narborough stand side by side,    
{but the land is worked in completely  
{different ways.}The land in Pentney is
 divided into small family owned farms,
 only using outside labour on a casual 
 basis. As well as arable farming sheep
 and cattle are fattened on small areas
 of pasture set aside for this.        
                                       
 The majority of land at Narborough is 
 farmed by one farmer and owned by a   
 large company. There is a large labour
 force using big machinery. There is a 
 herd of 296 milking cows.             
                                       
  Narborough trout farm covers 20 acres
 with over 50,000 fish. The trout are  
 brought in at 4oz and take 18 months  
 to reach 6-7 lbs.                     </content>
