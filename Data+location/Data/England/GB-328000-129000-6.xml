		<content> At home we have a cider shed with an  
 apple crusher and a cider press.      
 Last year we made cider and           
 perry. The Smiths helped us make it.  
 First we picked the apples and then   
 carted them down to the shed. We      
 crushed them to a pulp and made a     
 "cheese" with layers of straw and     
 apple pulp. We left the cider to      
 ferment for three to five weeks, when 
 it was  ready to drink. We usually add
 sugar.   {By Rosie Darch              
  At school we carry on the tradition  
 of maypole dancing and Mayfayres.We

 Court.We are going to Shepton Mallet  
 soon.At our Mayfayre we had clog      
 dancers.At school we have another     
 custom,ringing the school bell.It is  
 rung every morning at 9.00am before   
 assembly.  By
