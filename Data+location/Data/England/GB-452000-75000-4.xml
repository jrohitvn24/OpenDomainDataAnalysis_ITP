		<title>04St.Lawrence Village</title>
		<content> St.Lawrence is situated between a     
 great rocky cliff on the north and the
 sea to the south.The village and      
 surrounding area is very{             
 picturesque.The tiny village was built
 chiefly in Queen Victoria's reign     
 around the old church which dates from
 the 12th century.It was at first so   
 small that it hardly merited the title
 of'village'. The area is extremely    
 popular today particularly with older 
 people because of its peacefulness and
 remarkable scenery.People come to     
 retire here and the great wall of the 
 'Undercliff' now shelters many large  
 and distinctive villas which fall into
 a higher than average price range on  
 the market.  There is one provision   
 shop which incorporates a Post Office 
 serving the community, a parish church
 and a village hall.
