		<content> Brushford &amp; the immediate surrounding 
 area has changed very little with the 
 passing of time. The church is        
 beautifully kept &amp; dates back to the  
 12th century &amp; is situated            
 picturesquely on the top of Brushford 
 Hill. There are several interesting   
 houses in the area. Below the church  
 is Brushford Barton. Although the     
 facade is 19th Century much of it     
 dates back further. It is clearly     
 visible from the main road below      
 (B3220). Brushford Mill (a former     
 mill) lower down on the River,        
 Abbotsham, which was once a monastry. 
 From here the monks travelled from the
 farm to mine silver below Reeve Farm  
 to the North of the area. Very few of 
 the dwellings in Brushford are visible
 from the road as most are down long   
 tracks.
