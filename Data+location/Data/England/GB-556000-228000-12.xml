		<content> Most of the employment is in          
 connection with the farms, growing and
 harvesting the crops or tending the   
 livestock which includes poultry and  
 turkeys. The farmer who has a milk    
 round employs men to deliver the milk 
 in this locality. One or two larger   
 houses have a gardener and one farm   
 goes in for horticulture in a         
 commercial way. There is a pit selling
 sand for building, a timber supplier  
 and on the site of the old Thaxted    
 station a coal depot. There are a few 
 people living in the area who travel  
 to work outside. Builders,            
 electricians and plumbers have to be  
 called out from a town when needed but
 the men on the farms are able to do   
 the maintenance of machinery and a    
 great deal of the household and farm  
 equipment.
