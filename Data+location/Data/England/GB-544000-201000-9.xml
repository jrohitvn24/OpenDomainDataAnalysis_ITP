		<title>09FARMING AROUND EPPING</title>
		<content> In 1936 one man with two horses could 
 plough only one acre in a day. In 1985
 one man with a 100 h.p. tractor can   
 plough 25 acres in a day. This is one 
 way in which farming has changed.     
{Epping Bury Farm}employed 22 men in   
 1932: now the 183 hectares are farmed 
 by the owner plus 3 men.              
 Growing cereals alone has not been    
{economical}in recent years, and a     
 variety of crops is now planted. The  
 crops grown today are wheat, peas,    
 oats, oilseed rape, barley, and beans.
 Oilseed rape is a very widely-grown   
 crop locally. This year the farmer has
 118 fat cattle which are kept for     
 beef.                                 
 Today's farmworker works from 8 a.m.  
 to 5 p.m.and gets{Â£110}per week. In   
 the past milk was delivered by horse  
 and cart: now, in 1985 milk is        
 delivered by tankers.  (cont.)        </content>
