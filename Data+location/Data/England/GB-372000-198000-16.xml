 I enjoyed watching the traditional    
 Morris dancing on Saturday. The Morris
 men did a special dance belonging to  
 Gloucestershire. The men wore white   
 shirts and trousers decorated with    
 bells and ribbons. They did solo and  
 team dances. According to custom the  
 music is cheerful and simple and so   
 are the steps. Sometimes women take   
 part nowadays.                        
 On Saturday, June 15th, I went to     
 Dursley Carnival. First I watched a   
 procession of colourful floats. I     
 liked the Walt Disney float of One    
 Hundred and One Dalmatians and the    
 Ghost Buster float. The Brownies went 
 on foot dressed as clowns. Bands      
 marched and played too. I followed the
 procession to the Recreation field    
 where there was a steel band playing  
 and lots of exciting stalls.          </content>
