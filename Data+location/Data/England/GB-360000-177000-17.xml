		<title>17Frenchay Village History</title>
		<content>   In the 15th and 16th centuries      
 there were corn, flock and snuff mills
 working on the river Frome and pennant
 stone was quarried locally, so the    
 millers and quarry men founded the    
 earliest settlement.  During the next 
 two centuries  the village became the 
 centre of a thriving Quaker community,
 William Penn of Pennsylvania U.S.A    
 becoming associated with the village  
 through marriage.  Many of Frenchay's 
 large beautiful houses were built at  
 this time by the rich merchants from  
 Bristol. The wooded parklands they    
 stand in survive today.  The village  
 was designated a Conservation area in 
 1975 so it still retains its rural    
 atmosphere of river, wooded valley,   
 commonland, parkland, gracious houses 
 and small cottages, together with     
 modern well-designed housing          
 developments on its perimeter.        </content>
