		<content>GENERAL DESCRIPTION                    
 This study block, a rural area 5km    
north of Gloucester, is cut into two   
distinct parts by the River Severn     
which runs southwards through it.      
 To the east of the river lies the     
village of Sandhurst, located on the   
flood plain and surrounded by scattered
farms. It is a fairly isolated         
settlement approached only by minor    
roads. On the western side of the river
is a ridge of high land along which a  
minor road leads north to the nearby   
village of Hartpury. Settlement is     
scattered and consists of both         
residential and farm buildings.        
 After being an agricultural area for  
many generations there are signs that  
changes are now taking place and the   
character of Sandhurst in particular is
being altered.                         
                                       </content>
