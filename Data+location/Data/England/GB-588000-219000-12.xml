		<title>12REV.MIDDLETONS WORK.</title>
		<content> Rev.Middleton told Daniel and Philip  
 that he finds his work difficult      
 because he lives in one place(Copford)
 and he has responsibility also for    
 another place, so its difficult.      
   Easthorpe is a much smaller village 
 than Copford,therefore he has to go   
 sometimes less often.                 
   Things happen to people in Easthorpe
 two or three times maybe in a month   
 which means he has to spend  more time
 there if people need him.It all       
 depends on what happens.He also told  
 us that in the country most people    
 who live in villages know the Parson  
 in some kind of way;he meets them     
 more often during the week and in     
 events at the village hall.He meets   
 them much more in the street because  
 he is out and about much more than he 
 is at village hall events.
