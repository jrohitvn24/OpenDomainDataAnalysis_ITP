		<title>01OUR BLOCK</title>
		<content>Our block has one village in it,       
Lewknor, and two hamlets,Shirburn and  
Pyrton. It is located at the foot of   
the Chiltern Hills (on the western     
side). We are about 16 miles from      
Oxford. The villages are easily        
accessible from both London and Oxford 
because the M40 motorway runs just to  
the North of them. The block does not  
have many amenities. It is mainly      
farmland. In Lewknor we have a         
primary school, a church, a shop and   
Post Office combined, an agricultural  
machinary supplier and a public        
house.Pyrton has a pub, a garden       
centre, and a church. There is a       
private castle with a church at        
Shirburn. Our nearest towns are        
Watlington, which is 2 miles away, and 
Thame, which is 6 miles away.
