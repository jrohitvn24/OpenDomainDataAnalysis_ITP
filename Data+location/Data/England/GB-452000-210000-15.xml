		<title>15PICK YOUR OWN FRUIT</title>
		<content>  The Oxford "Pick_your_own" fruit farm
 embodies a typical 20th century idea  
 in harvesting. Instead of the farmer  
 paying for labour to pick the fruit   
 and vegetables, the public are invited
 to pick the produce themselves. This  
 means that the "middle_man's" profit  
 is cut out, and people know that they 
 are getting the pick of the crop at a 
 reasonable price.                     
  In the soft_fruit season whole       
 families come out and pick the produce
 for home_freezing and jam_making. It  
 is weighed and paid for on the spot.  
  Fruit grown includes strawberries,   
 raspberries,blackcurrants and         
 gooseberries. Vegetables grown are    
 spinach, runner beans, courgettes,    
 onions and potatoes. Volunteers from  
 the church in Elsfield run a tea stall
 to raise money for the church funds.
