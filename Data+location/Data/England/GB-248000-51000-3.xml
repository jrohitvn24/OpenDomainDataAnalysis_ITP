    Radford Park is the largest        
{recreational}area in Plymstock. Once  
 the Radford Estate, there are still   
 ruins of the old boat-house and the   
  seventeenth century lodge keeper's   
 house in the{parkland}near the lake.  
 There are many improvements being     
 made around the lake: streams have    
 been bridged, paths covered by        
 stone chippings,a wide variety of     
 trees planted, nesting sites for      
{wildlife}created and wooden benches   
  provided.                            
 This work currently being undertaken  
 by young unemployed teenagers as part 
 of a{government training scheme}aims  
 to make the park a centre for{leisure 
 and education. By combining attractive
 landscape, varied wildlife habitats   
 and public access the{Radford Project 
 will improve recreational facilities. </content>
