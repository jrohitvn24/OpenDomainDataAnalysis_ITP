		<title>08Drayton Church Choirmaster</title>
		<content> Mr Green,the choirmaster,was a        
 cheerful man who loved children.In    
 fact Mr Green was so nice that I don't
 know of anyone  who disliked him.When 
 our choir first began there were ten  
 children but now there are only       
 five.Last year Mr Green went on       
 holiday and when he returned he bought
 us all a stick of rock.For a boy who  
 is diabetic,he gave special           
 chocolates.                           
 Sadly,though,in the November of last  
 year,Mr Green died of cancer.It came  
 as  such a great shock to us all      
 because no_one knew of his            
 illness.After his death we gave his   
 widow a bunch of flowers.
