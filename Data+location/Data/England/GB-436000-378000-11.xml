		<content>{Linky.}Someone, who is called the     
 person "on", has to count to about 100
 whilst the others run off and hide.   
 Then the people who have run off try  
 and get "linky save them all" by      
 touching the post that the person who 
 is "on" is guarding and saying        
 "linky save them all" which means     
 that the person who is "on" has to    
 count again. They have about three    
 goes and on the third go the first    
 person they see becomes the one to    
 be "on".
