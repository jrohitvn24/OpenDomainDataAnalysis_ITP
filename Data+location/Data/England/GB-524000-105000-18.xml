		<content>  I like to play Teams,a game we made  
 up.One team runs away and the other   
 team tries to catch them.When you are 
 caught you have to stay in the cage   
 until someone frees you by 'hadding'  
 you.'Hadding' you means tapping them  
 so they can run away again.When       
 everybody is caught the other team    
 runs away.                            
  One person is 'it' and counts to     
 44.All the rest hide.When the person  
 has finished counting he looks for    
 you.If you can get to the post without
 him seeing you first then you can     
 shout "44 save all" which means       
 everybody who has been seen is saved. 
  We play Hot Rice.Everybody stands    
 against a wall and the person who is  
 'it' has a tennis ball.He tries to hit
 the people against the wall and if he 
 does they are 'it'.
