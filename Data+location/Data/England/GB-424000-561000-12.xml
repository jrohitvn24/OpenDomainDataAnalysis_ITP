		<content>  Some games are universal and have    
 changed little over hundreds of years.
 The following are a selection of games
 played by the children at St.Mary's   
 C.E. Infants/Nursery School.          
{RING A RING A ROSES}The aim of the    
 game is to skip around singing in a   
 ring and all fall down together at the
 end. The game originates from the{    
{Great Plague of London}.The circle    
 represents the rash, the pocket full  
 of posies the herbs carried to ward   
 off infection and atishoo the sneeze  
 which was the final and fatal symptom 
 before death.                         
{HOPSCOTCH}This has been played since  
 the days of the{Romans}.You need a    
 stone and a bay marked with numbers.  
 The stone is thrown onto a number. You
 hop and jump up the bay and back again
 to pick up the stone.If you land on a 
 line you are out.                     </content>
