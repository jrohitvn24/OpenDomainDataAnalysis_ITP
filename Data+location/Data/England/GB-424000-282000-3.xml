		<title>03Meriden-Cyclists' Memorial.</title>
		<content> Meriden has always been a popular     
 visiting place for cyclists as it lies
 so close to large urban areas, as well
 as being at the centre of England.    
                                       
 On the village green stands the{      
{"Cyclists' National Memorial",}which, 
 according to its inscription, was     
 erected "To the Lasting Memory of     
 those cyclists who died in the Great  
 War, 1914-18".                        
                                       
 This memorial is the scene of an      
 annual service of rememberance which  
 is attended by cyclists from all parts
 of the British Isles.
