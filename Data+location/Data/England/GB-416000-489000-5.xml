 village and 4 farms.Some other houses 
 are currently being built.There is a  
 Post Office which also sells icecream 
 and sweets;and a small village shop.  
 There is a public house which is      
 called "The Queen's Head".            
                                       
   At the top of the bank is a gravel  
 heap for use in the bad weather.In    
 addition there is a telephone         
 box.There are 2 Wesleyan Chapels,one  
 of which is in ruins,the other,built  
 in 1910,is still in use.

 rectory,has a large garden.In the     
 garden are the remains of 2 large fish
