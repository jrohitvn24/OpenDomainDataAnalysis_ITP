		<title>01AREA WEST OF WIVELISCOMBE</title>
		<content> This rural,unspoilt part of Somerset  
 is mainly grazing farmland,but        
 includes some woodland (recently used 
 for pheasant rearing), and the western
 edge of the old market town of        
 Wiveliscombe.The village of           
 Chipstable, with its 14th century     
 church, is to the west.               
                                       
 The nearest towns are Taunton (17km to
 the east),Milverton and Wellington. To
 the north,the Bristol Channel is 16km 
 away at the port of Watchet.          
                                       
 Wiveliscombe Recreation Ground is the 
 home of thriving Cricket,Rugby and    
 Tennis clubs, and there ia an outdoor 
 swimming pool. There are many         
 interesting walks and picturesque     
 views. Bulland Ford and Washbattle    
 Mills may both be seen during a walk  
 along the River Tone.                 </content>
