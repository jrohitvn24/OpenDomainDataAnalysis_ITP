		<title>15Adult Education</title>
		<content> There are Adult Education Centres in  
 all areas of Sheffield. Most of them  
 are attached to schools. You can get  
 some idea of the things that adults   
 are interested in from the courses    
 that the Centres offer.               
     Some people didn't learn to read  
 and do maths very well at school, and 
 there are special literacy classes    
 for them.                             
     It is possible to learn a foreign 
 language - French, Spanish and German 
 are the most common, and English for  
 people from other countries like India
 and Pakistan whp have come to live    
 here.                                 
     There are Cookery classes, Sewing 
 and Soft-Furnishing. Keep-Fit is very 
 popular, and Aerobics is the latest   
 craze for women to keep fit and in    
 shape.                                
                                       </content>
