		<content> Mrs Allen has lived in LITTLE OAKLEY  
 for 78 years and is now 81.           
     " There once was a bridge and a   
 ford,but 20 years ago the bridge was  
 made flat,and the ford was drained and
 fenced.Also there was a spring with a 
 stone hand with a hole in it where the
 children would drink from.There used  
 to be a beer house and every Sunday   
 men would come for miles to have a    
 drink.There was once a school, but it 
 was closed down when there weren't    
 enough children in the village.The    
 main celebrations were May Day and    
 the coronation of King George and     
 Queen Mary.On May Day the children    
 would parade through the village      
 carrying a basket decorated with      
 flowers.On the coronation the         
 villagers would join together in a    
 barn and have a party" (cont.P4)
