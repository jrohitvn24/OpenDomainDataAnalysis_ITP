		<title>16HOUSING IN TRETHURGY</title>
		<content> In the mid nineteenth century,        
 Trethurgy was a thriving tin mining   
 village with Ruby Cottage, built in   
 1835, the headquarters. Most land     
 belonged to the Trevannions of the    
 Treverbyn Estate. In response to the  
 mining boom, a major building         
 programme started in 1862 with the    
 construction of a Chapel and school.  
 Later in the century, tin mining      
 collapsed and the population          
 gradually declined. In 1930, with     
 falling rolls, the school closed.     
 Recently, with the growth of the China
 Clay industry, the population is      
 growing and new houses are            
 being built. Nevertheless, the Chapel 
 closed in 1985, due to low            
 attendances. Both the Chapel and      
 school remain in the village, but     
 neither carry out their original      
 function.                             </content>
