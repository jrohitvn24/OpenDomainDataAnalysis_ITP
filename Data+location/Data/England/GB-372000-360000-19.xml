		<content>      Sandbach being a market town has 
 excellent road links with all the     
 surrounding areas.Two main roads      
 converge or pass through the town     
 centre.The A534 links the town with   
 Congleton(seven miles to the east of  
 Sandbach) and to the major rail town  
 of Crewe,five miles to the south-west.
 The other main road,the A533, passes  
 through Sandbach and links the town   
 with Alsager,four miles to the south- 
 east,and with Middlewich and Northwich
 to the north-west.From each of the    
 towns mentioned it is then possible to
 reach any part of the North-West of   
 England or Wales.                     
      However,Sandbach's greatest asset
 is its proximity to the M6 Motorway.  
 Less than one mile from the town      
 centre it provides links with the rest
 of the country through the remaining  
 motorway network.                     </content>
