		<title>20WARREN FARM IN THE W WIGHT</title>
		<content>  The present tenent of Warren Farm is 
 Mr.John Osman.On his farm he has a    
 dairy.A dairy is one that keeps cows  
 and sells their milk locally in the   
 Totland area.For years the farm has   
 been owned by the Ward family and is  
 known as part of the Ward estate.Years
 ago the Ward estate owned quite a lot 
 of land in Freshwater,Totland and Alum
 Bay.Quite a lot of it has been built  
 over the last 30yrs.Before Mr.Osman   
 moved to Warren it was in the Dimmick 
 family,some still living in Totland   
 today.Mr.George Dimmick used to go    
 round Totland in a horse drawn cart,  
 known as a milk float,selling his     
 milk,butter,cream and eggs to the     
 local people.Today a lot of the area  
 has been cleared of gorse and bracken 
 and the land reclaimed for            
 agricultural use.
