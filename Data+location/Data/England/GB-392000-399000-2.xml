{HEADS &amp; VOLLEYS}is a game for 3 or

 with the others staying outside. One  
 of the outside players kicks the ball 
 in the air and the others try to score
 without the ball touching the ground -

{UPPY-UPPY}is game where one player has
 to catch the others who run around.   
 Players are only 'safe' when they     
 stand on something which is above     
 ground level. You can remain 'safe'   
 for 10 seconds. If you are caught, you
 then become the catcher -{Adam.}      
{KINGY}involves all players except one 
 making a circle. The one in the middle
 has to roll a ball through the legs of
 the other in order to change places   
 with them -{Vaishali.}
