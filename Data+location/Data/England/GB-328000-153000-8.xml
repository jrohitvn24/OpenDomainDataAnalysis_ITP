		<title>08BREAN SANDS HOLIDAY CAMP (1)</title>
		<content>   The holiday camp at Brean sands     
covers quite a large area.It is a self 
catering holiday centre with the       
attraction of entertainment on the     
doorstep.All the leisure facilities and
night life are included in the cost of 
the holiday and once you've paid,your  
entertainment and activities are free. 
   The majority of people we spoke with
said the entertainment was of very high
standard and this wasn't their first   
holiday in the village.                
   The variety of entertainment        
includes late night disco's,cabaret,bar
and ballroom dancing.They are all well 
supervised.A disabled man we spoke to  
told us that the facilities for        
disabled were quite good but there was 
no entrance to the pool for the elderly
and he complained about the noise of   
the music.The facilities include a     
heated pool.Continued on page 2        </content>
