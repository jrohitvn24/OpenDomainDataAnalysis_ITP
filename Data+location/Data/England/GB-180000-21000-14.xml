		<content>{     A DAY IN THE LIFE OF SIMON       
 When I get up I play with my farm for 
 a minute or two. When I have done that
 I get dressed and clean my teeth then 
 I go downstairs for breakfast.  I live
 on a farm so I go down to the yard and
 let my hens out, then I feed them.    
 When I have fed my hens I come in and 
 get my bag and coat and walk to the   
 top of the lane.  I wait there for my 
 lift.  When the lady picks me up she  
 takes me to school with two other     
 children.  When I get to school I hang
 my coat and bag up and play football  
 until the headmaster calls me in.     
 First I do reading then I do spellings
 and writing.  When school is over I   
 come home and turn on the TV.  I watch
 all the childrens programmes then I   
 have to do my work.  First I get my   
 baby duck in and help with the cows   
 then we all have dinner and go to bed.</content>
