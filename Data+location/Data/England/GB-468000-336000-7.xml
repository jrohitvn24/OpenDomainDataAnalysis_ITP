		<title>07INDUSTRY: CROPWELL BUTLER</title>
		<content> Local industry thrives but is sadly   
 depleted from its former state. This  
 year the blacksmith has retired after 
 3 generations, and the "Smithy" may   
 now close. Surviving local craft is   
 joinery &amp; the services now offered are
 by a Joinery &amp; Fitted Furniture       
 Manufacturer, employing 22, of whom 6 
 live in the village. There is another 
 small joinery firm who are also       
 builders &amp; plumbers. The general store
 closed during the 1970's &amp; only a Post
 Office remains.We have our own service
 for milk delivery, supplied by a Vale 
 of Belvoir dairy. A small business    
 produces sausages, pies &amp; pastry for  
 home cooking from a production unit in
 the grounds of a large private house, 
 &amp; a textile design studio has trans-  
 Atlantic connections. Landscape design
 is carried out by a small firm. We can
 never again be self-supporting.       </content>
