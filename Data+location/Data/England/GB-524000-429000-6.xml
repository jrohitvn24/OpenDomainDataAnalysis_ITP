		<content>              MR WRAY                  
     Mr. Wray came into the school to  
 tell us about the village and the     
 school and the ways in which they have
 changed.                              
     He has lived in the village all   
 his life and his family have been here
 for generations. He is well known in  
 the village for his local knowledge   
 and he has a huge collection of       
 photographs which he has taken, or has
 had given to him, over the years.     
     Mr. Wray was the Parish Clerk for 
 forty years.                          
     He only went to the village school
 until he was eleven years old because 
 his family was one of the few that    
 could afford to send their children to
 the Grammar School in Hull.           
    Mr. Wray knew everyone in the      
 village at one time but now there are 
 so many more people living here.      </content>
