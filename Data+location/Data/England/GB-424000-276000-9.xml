		<title>09ELECTRICITY SUB-STATIONS</title>
		<content> Electricity comes to our homes from a 
 power station. The electrical pressure
 in the wires is controlled by the     
 output of the generators and by       
 sub-stations along the route. At      
 Hodgetts Lane is a sub-station which  
 feeds electricity to the national Grid
 system. This sub-station operates at  
 275,000 and 400,000 volts. The        
 electricity from here is carried to   
 Grid supply points by means of        
 overhead transmission lines suspended 
 from transmossion towers. Sometimes in
 built-up areas underground cables are 
 used instead of overhead lines.       
 Tanners Lane sub-station is a bulk    
 supply point and this reduces the     
 voltage to 11,000 volts. The 11,000   
 volt cables then go to sub-stations   
 where the voltage is again transformed
 to 240 volts for direct use in shops, 
 schools, homes and factories.         </content>
