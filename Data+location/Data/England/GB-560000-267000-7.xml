		<title>07Newmarket Sewage Treatment</title>
		<content>   The sewage treatment plant in the   
 Fordham Road between Newmarket and    
 Fordham is part of the Anglian Water  
 Authority. It handles all the sewage  
 from Newmarket and Exning. The sewage 
 is filtered then pumped into          
 settlement tanks where bacteria break 
 down the solids. The tanks are sprayed
 with clean water to help this process.
 Afterwards the sludge is given to     
 farmers as fertiliser and the fluids  
 are treated then pumped into the local
 River Snail.                          
   The plant employs two operatives and
 a truck driver and is supervised by a 
 member of the authority based in Diss 
 who has responsibility for 30 plants  
 in the South Norfolk and Suffolk area.
 The plant was put here because the    
 land was available at the right time  
 and it provided a suitable position   
 on the water course for drainage.     </content>
