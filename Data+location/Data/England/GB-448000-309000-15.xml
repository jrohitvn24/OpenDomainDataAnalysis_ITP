		<content> PODDY                                 
 At school I like playing poddy.  I    
 will tell you how to play it. First   
 you need three or more players. One of
 them is on and can count to as many as
 you want.When the counter sees one of 
 the runners the counter runs back to  
 the post and shouts 'Poddy one two    
 three Francis' and Francis is out.But 
 if by chance the other runner gets to 
 the post before the counter does and  
 shouts 'Free all'all the other runners
 are free and the counter counts       
 again.Poddy is a popular game.        
 HIDE AND SEEK                         
 First of all someone is chosen to     
 count while the others hide.When they 
 have finished they go and look for the
 people who are hiding.When everyone   
 has been found the game is repeated   
 with the person who was first found as
 the counter.                          </content>
