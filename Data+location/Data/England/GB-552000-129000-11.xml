		<content> There are two main industrial estates 
 in our area,Connor's Yard and Jarvis  
 Brook.The ground area for each factory
 averages 2000 sq.ft. &amp; the number of  
 people employed varies according to   
 size, usually between 3 to 100 but    
 Servomex is the largest with 260.An   
 average daily shift is 8 hours between
 0900_1700hrs.Most employees work 10hrs
 overtime per week.Most factories were 
 established in the 1980's and are the 
 main source of employment in the area.
 Computers are used to store informa_  
 tion about accounts and one person is 
 responsible for this.Safety standards 
 are very high, with fire alarms and   
 extinguishers.Workers are not allowed 
 to use dangerous machinery unless they
 have been trained professionally, even
 then protective clothing must be worn.
 Recreational facilities are very poor.
