		<title>11LEISURE SURVEY(cont.)</title>
		<content>  When asked for what age group people 
 wanted the entertainment for, most    
 people wanted it for all age groups.  
  Virtually everybody said that they   
 would like to see either a disco or   
 youthclub in Ickenham.                
  We also asked a sixth question       
 concerning their shopping habits.More 
 people seemed to go to Uxbridge for   
 their shopping, rather than Ickenham  
 itself.People go to Ruislip aswell for
 their shopping.                       
  For shopping, as for where people    
 went, 8 different places were         
 mentioned, so perhaps this means that 
 Ickenham does not provide enough      
 shops, or a wide variety.             
  Survey carried out by Paula Rhodes   
 and Neela Suchak.
