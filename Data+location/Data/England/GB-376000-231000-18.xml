		<content>  In the Winter of 1984/85 we had a big
 snow storm, it was dreadful.  We      
 stayed off School for two days.  If we
 went to School we had to take our     
 wellington boots.  At play time we    
 played snow balls and made snow men   
 and we made igloos.  When we had to   
 stay at home I played He-man. When we 
 went to School the roads were slippery
 and skiddy.  One day during Assembly  
 we saw a fox on the playing field.  We
 stopped and watched the fox trot right
 around our big field.  It went slowly,
 looking at us, the snow showing up its
 lovely red coat.  Later on we followed
 the fox's tracks to try to find its   
 den.  The lane outside the school was 
 so slippery that everyone had to drive
 very carefully. A farmer brought his  
 tractor to clear the School drive for 
 the teachers to get their cars in.
