 LIGHTNING STRIKES WELTON CHURCH.      
                                       
 This event was reported in the        
 Illustrated London News in Sept. 1847.
 The Parson had just entered the pulpit
 at 2pm and the lightning struck and he
 was deafened for life.  The lightning 
 had struck the tower and travelled    
 along the chandeliers. John Brownlow  
 was killed - his waistcoat buttons    
 melted by the heat. 5 other women and 
 a boy were also injured. Mr. Baldwin's
 grave can still be seen in the Church 
 yard.
