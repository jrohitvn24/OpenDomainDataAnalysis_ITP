		<content> Radford is a nice place to live. There
 are lots of things for children       
 instead of everything for adults. I go
 to a{Karate}club every Tuesday. It is 
 great fun for people who are          
 interested.  Nearly everywhere you go 
 there are{parks}but there are{clubs}  
 etc. for adults. There are also a lot 
 of industries. In Radford there are   
 lots of famous{industries.}           
 Every day I go outside to play. Most  
 of the time I cannot play with my     
 friends because they live in the new  
 houses near school. The best thing to 
 play is{'dobby'}on the 'monkey        
 climber' in the park. We have a       
{Leisure Centre}built near our school -
 we go there every Monday for swimming.
 I am doing my Level 1 Swimming Test. I
 think the Leisure Centre is great but 
 it would be better if it had diving   
 boards. I think Radford is great!     </content>
