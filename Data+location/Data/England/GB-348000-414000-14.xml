		<title>14Newcomers to Eccleston</title>
		<content>     "My family moved into Eccleston   
because of my dad's job; it is near to 
where he works. Before we came to      
Eccleston we used to live in           
Northampton, where my dad was an       
engineer and my mum did not go out to  
work. Now my dad is a manufacturing    
director and my mum is a part-time     
teacher and social worker. I have no   
grandparents in this area."-Kathryn    
     "I am called Stephen, and I have a
brother who is three years younger. We 
used to live in a village in           
Warwickshire. We came to Eccleston     
because my dad got a new job. We chose 
to live in Eccleston because it is nice
and peaceful. My mum teaches Italian   
and French part-time in a secondary    
school, and my dad is headmaster of a  
sixth-form college."
