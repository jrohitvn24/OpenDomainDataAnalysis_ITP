		<title>05The Railway</title>
		<content> There was once a story told to me     
 about the railway.  It went like      
 this.There were once two men. One man 
 said to the other, 'I bet you Â£10 that
 you could not gallop in front of a    
 train.'  So the next day Major Morgan 
 set off to the railway to wait for a  
 train to come.  When a train did come,
 Major Morgan galloped in front of it  
 and won the bet, but he had to pay a  
 fine of about Â£100.  So he was worse  
 off after all.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
