		<content>  Our class conducted some surveys to  
 find out what people living in Ching- 
 ford do in their spare time.To find   
 out we took letters home to our       
 families.They had to tick off the     
 activities that they did in their     
 spare time.We made big graphs so      
 everyone could see them.Here are a few
 things we found they took part in;
