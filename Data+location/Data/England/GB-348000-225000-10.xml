		<content>  Cider Fruit Farming                  
      Although a cider-producing county
 most farms have grubbed out their     
 cider orchards as the older varieties 
 are no longer acceptable to the       
 manufacturers and an uneconomic crop. 
 Bulmers own many orchards tending to  
 take less from small growers.  One    
 local farm has 3 acres and produces   
 200 gallons of their own cider and    
 perry from a 200 year old press.      
 Another has 6 acres of fruit with     
 varieties such as Dabinet, Norman,    
 Michelin, Yarlington Mill and         
 Tremelet.  Harvesting can take up to 6
 weeks and the fruit is transported by 
 the farmer with no guaranteed prices  
 or quotas at the selling end.         
      Many of the old varieties (often 
 more tasteful) are now lost except for
 the cultivars held in research        
 stations, or gene banks.              </content>
