		<content>  Hedgerows are cut by machine, and are
 composed mainly of hawthorn, hazel and
 elder, with brambles growing through. 
 Stone field walls are found mostly    
 around Scotton.                       
  Water birds, such as Snow, Barnacle  
 and Canada Geese, are attracted to    
 Farmire Fishiry and to the flooded    
 gravel workings. Near Farnham there is
 a starling roost.                     
  Throstle Nest Farm has badger setts  
 on its land.                          
  The rare Fly Orchid is to be found in
 Farnham (or Gibbet) Wood.             
  The York and Ainsty Hunt comes across
 this land but does no damage.         
  New estates of houses are built of   
 material sympathetic to the older     
 buildings and are not intrusive.
