		<title>09Changing times in Rawmarsh</title>
		<content>     Mr Simmonite has lived in Rawmarsh
 all his life. He was born in{Forge Row
 on Parkgate but moved when he was four
 years old to{Peashill St.}He went to  
{Dale Road School,}now closed, where   
 pupils had to pass exams each year to 
 move up.                              
     Children in those days played     
 'Whip up top' and with cigarette cards
 and unlike today they had to make     
 their own games which had to be cheap.
     When he was working Mr Simmonite  
 had 6-7 days holiday per year. When he
 had saved up enough money he went on a
 5 shilling trip to{Blackpool}by train,
 leaving Parkgate at 11 o'clock  and   
 sometimes not getting back until 2    
 o'clock the next morning.             
     Mr Simmonite has driven since 1939
 when 30 mph was a fast speed. His     
 first car was a Morris 8. In those    
 days a car would last for 15-20 years.</content>
