pigs,cattle and sheep.There is a       
specialist pig  unit which has  800    
pigs.They are sold to butchers for     
bacon,pork etc.Breeding sows are also  
sold to other pig units.The markets    
used for buying and selling other      
livestock are Northampton and          
Kettering.They also grow other arable  
crops and make their own silage for    
feeding cattle in the winter.          
    There are 3 men working on the farm
together with Mr.R. and Mr.B.Knight.   
    They have tractors,ploughs,drills, 
silage chopper,sprayers,sludge tankers,
bailers and a combine which harvests   
the grain.

the work.                              </content>
