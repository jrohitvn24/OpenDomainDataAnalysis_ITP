		<title>18Transport around North Leigh</title>
		<content>The area in our D-block is very rural. 
North Leigh is the only village        
within the block. As there are not     
many  amenities there, people have to  
travel into Oxford or Witney to get    
what they want.In North Leigh cars are 
necessary for getting around.There are 
not many shops there, so people use    
cars for travelling around.North Leigh 
doesn't have a regular bus service.    
However most people in North leigh     
own cars.The area around North leigh   
is a farming area.There are many       
farmers and they use land rovers to    
travel around, as they are rough       
teritory vehicles. Farmers use them    
for getting to the animals and the     
fields in bad weather. The tracks are  
very muddy and very rough,and it would 
be difficult to use them without a     
landrover.
