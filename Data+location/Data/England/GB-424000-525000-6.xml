		<content>      Our school is called{St. Francis 
{C.E. Junior School.}Our school has a  
 hall, a staff-room, two large open    
 plan teaching areas, toilets, storage 
 areas and a sanctuary and rooms for   
 use by the church.                    
      In addition to the headmaster,   
 there are six teachers, who have a    
 class each, and a part-time remedial  
 reading teacher.                      
      We have a housepoint system with 
 the houses being named after St. Aiden
 (green), St. Cuthbert (yellow), St.   
 Bede (red) and St. Hilda (blue). We   
 have assembly every day and once a    
 month we have a school eucharist.     
      We go on educational visits. The 
 last one was to Eldon. It was very    
 interesting but the walking was       
 terrible!                             
      My favourite subject is maths. I 
 like our school it teaches me a lot.  </content>
