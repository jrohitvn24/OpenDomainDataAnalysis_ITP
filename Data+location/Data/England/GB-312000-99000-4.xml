		<title>04A WALK IN THE COUNTRY</title>
		<content> Today we went for a walk in the       
 countryside. We walked in deep mud.   
 Richard got his foot stuck in the mud 
 and his boot came off. His sock got   
 all muddy. Herbert jumped off a stile 
 into some mud. He got all splattered. 
 We all laughed at him. We went along  
 the River Wolf to the source, across  
 the fields and up the hill. We found  
 lots of different flowers, especially 
 primroses. We also found a buzzard's  
 wing and a chicken's leg. In Mr.      
 Gush's farm we saw some calves and a  
 puppy. It was good fun, but the       
 countryside was spoilt in some places 
 as there were a lot of rubbish dumps  
 in the stream. We passed several old  
 houses and saw the Nursery School     
 children at the Village Hall. Then we 
 came back to school.
