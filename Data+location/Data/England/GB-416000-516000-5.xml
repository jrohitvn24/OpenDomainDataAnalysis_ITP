 It was mentioned that the village was 
 commended in the{National Tidy Village
 contest last year. The chairman       
 thanked the scouts, guides and other  
 groups for helping to keep the village
 tidy and free of litter.              
 Efforts were being made to secure the 
 use of playing fields at the site of  
{St.Peter's School}from{S.P.Gainford.  
 The company has stated that they would
 make some facilities available.       
 Other tasks carried out by the council
 in the past year were establishing    
 where public footpaths were, and      
 improving dimly lit areas.            
 Another job the council was pleased to
 see completed was the improved        
 junction from{Eden Lane}which made a  
 dangerous corner much safer.          
 Finally, parishioners thanked the     
 council for their achievements.       </content>
