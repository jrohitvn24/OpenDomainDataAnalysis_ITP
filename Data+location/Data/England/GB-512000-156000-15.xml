 how the village had grown. More       
 houses,shops and roads but most still 
 liked living here. The longest        
 resident was 73 years ,"born and      
 bred" here.

 light upstairs (except candles) and   
 only one tap (cold). Some cooked on a 
 range while everyone had open fires _ 
 often using logs.One small boy used to
 spend Saturday chopping wood for      
 people who were unable to chop their  
 own.

 board . Or they used a copper kettle  </content>
