		<content> St.Peter's Newdigate,Church Spire     
 Shingles Project,was carried out      
 between 1978-1985.Ernie Harris,a      
 retired shingles maker from           
 Leicestershire,taught two local       
 craftsmen,Paul and Andrew Wright,to   
 cleave shingles.Inaddition to their   
 normal work they made 15,000 oak      
 shingles in five years.Oak shingles   
 cleaved with the grain have a stable  
 and waterproof quality.               
   Two charitable trusts,the Department
 of the Enviroment,together with past  
 and present residents raised the      
 necessarymoney.                       
   The steeplejack,Peter               
 Harknett,renowned for his             
 skill,dexterity and pride in his work 
 pointed out,"it is unique in this     
 century for a church spire to be clad 
 in oak shingles made locally by local 
 craftsmen from local trees."          </content>
