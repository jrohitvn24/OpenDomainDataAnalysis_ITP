		<title>09BEESTON JUNIOR SCHOOL</title>
		<content>  The newest building in the{Beeston   
{Rylands}area is the{New Rylands Junior
{School,}which was officially opened on
 18th April 1985.                      
  The school is built around a         
 courtyard,and is a replacement for an 
 old wooden building.                  
  The school has lots of modern        
 devices.The heating,the lighting and  
 the burglar alarm are all controlled  
 automatically by computers.           
  There are four pairs of open plan    
 classrooms,each with quiet rooms and a
 practical area for messy work.There   
 are two libraries,and an audio-visual 
 room for watching television and      
 music.                                
  The children like the new building   
 very much.
