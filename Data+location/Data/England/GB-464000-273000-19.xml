		<title>19Sport in Guilsborough</title>
		<content>Our school does a lot of sport,most of 
the boys play football at playtime as  
well as in football matches and the    
netballers do the same.In the summer   
the children play cricket.We also go to
village called Long Buckby to do       
athletics in the summer.Where I live we
also have a youth club which you can   
get into free and there are lots of    
games you can play like table tennis,  
this is a game where you use a net on a
table,2 bats and a ping-pong ball.In   
Guilsborough there is also an adult    
cricket and a football team.Cricket    
is a good sport for which you need 11  
people per side and you play it on a   
grass pitch.When I go home after school
I sometimes play cricket with my       
brothers,during the half terms and in  
holidays I play cricket and tennis.
