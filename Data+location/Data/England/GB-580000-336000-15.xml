		<title>15FARMING</title>
		<content> The land covered by the survey is     
 worked by four different farmers, two 
 owning their own land, two renting it 
 from a distant landowner.  Although in
 the middle of an area dominated by    
 corn and sugar beet, Stanhoe is       
 fortunate that its farmers prefer a   
 wider variety of stock and crops.  A  
 Friesian dairy herd as well as mixed  
 breed animals for fattening, with     
 Charolais and Aberdeen Angus bulls to 
 the fore.  Pigs are kept, also some   
 sheep.  One farm specialises in       
 vegetables and the area send tons of  
 carrots and parsnips to market (the   
 latter mostly to France) as well as   
 sprouts and winter cabbage.  Wheat and
 barley are the main corn crops, and   
 most straw is baled for use on the    
 farms.  Sugar beet is also grown on   
 all four farms and is sent to the     
 processing factory at King's Lynn.    </content>
