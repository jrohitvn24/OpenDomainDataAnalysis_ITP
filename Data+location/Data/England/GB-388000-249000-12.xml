		<title>12The Village Hall, Stoulton</title>
		<content>   The village hall plays an important 
 part in community life in Stoulton.   
 The hall was built in 1877 as a       
 village school until there were too   
 few Stoulton children to keep it open.
 It then closed in 1933. The children  
 now travel to the school at Drakes    
 Broughton. The hall belongs to the    
 church and the Parish Council pays a  
 "peppercorn" rent. It is built of red 
 brick with a tiled roof.              
   The hall provides a pleasant,       
 central meeting place in the village  
 and is frequently used for a wide and 
 expanding range of activities         
 including whist drives, dog training  
 classes, Woman Institute meetings,    
 Parochial Church and Parish Council   
 meetings, harvest suppers and other   
 social events. However, local people  
 seemed envious of the new village hall
 at Norton which is bigger.            </content>
