		<title>02DRAINING THE MARSHES.</title>
		<content>    In 1626 a Dutchman called{Cornelius
{Vermuyden}was given Letters of        
 Authority by{Charles I}to drain the   
 marshes in the Isle of Axholme,       
 around the vicinity of Crowle.        
 The king, Charles I, got Cornelius    
 Vermuyden to drain the Fen Lands      
 because he was well known in Holland  
 for draining. He was also very        
 successful in doing so.               
    When Cornelius Vermuyden had       
 drained the land he was very popular  
 and also unpopular because of what he 
 had done. He was popular among the    
 very rich land owners because they    
 wanted the land to use for farming    
 on.The profits provided taxes for the 
 King.                                 
    He was unpopular among poorer folk 
 because they needed the marsh land to 
 suvive.They needed it because the food
 they ate lived on or in the marshes.  </content>
