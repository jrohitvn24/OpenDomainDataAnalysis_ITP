		<title>11 The Hamlet Knighton</title>
		<content>  Knighton is a small hamlet situated  
 near Inkberrow.                       
  Fifty years ago all of the land was  
 owned by the Lord of Abergovenny and  
 was one big farm.Oxen and horses were 
 used to plough the land instead of    
 tractors.Then the Lord of Abergovenny 
 sold the land to the Marquis of       
Hertford,and it was then split into a  
few small farms.                       
  If a family wanted to move to        
Knighton then,they would have to build 
their own farm house or bungalow.The   
people building their homes often used 
stones from Ragley mill.Fifty years ago
to get to the shops,the people had to  
walk across the fields to the          
neighbouring town for food.Nowadays    
there is a bus service,but it only     
runs once a week.                      
  There are a few local activities such
as deer hunting and occasional fetes.  </content>
