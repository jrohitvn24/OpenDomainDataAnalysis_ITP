		<title>16FISHING INDUSTRY IN HULL</title>
		<content> The first mention of Fishiing in Hull 
 in historical documents is 1160 when  
 Monks of the Meaux Abbey were given   
 the 'Cain Charter' to fish the Humber.
 Since then though there have been many
 changes and Hull grew to be the major 
 Fish Port in Europe.  Then came one of
 the most dramatic declines in Hulls   
 history.  Hull now has just 2 deep sea
 trawlers, 7 years ago there were 70.  
 Why? Common Market quotas were to low 
 and costs rose at the same time there 
 was an extension of fishing limits to 
 200 miles which cut Hulls fleet off   
 from its traditional grounds.  All is 
 not lost though as the fish market    
 still flourishes and the fish         
 processing industry is still strong.  
 Last year firms such as Birds Eye,    
 Ross Foods,Marr's and Smales used     
 50,000 tonnes of fish and Icelandic   
 boats landed fish worth Â£4m in Hull.  </content>
