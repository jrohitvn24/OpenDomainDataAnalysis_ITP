		<title>08An old person from Shedfield</title>
		<content>   We have interviewed 78 year old     
 Commander Richard Phillimore whose    
 family have been associated with      
 Shedfield since 1866.                 
   In 1866 his grandfather moved to    
 Shedfield House where he lived with   
 his wife and 7 children.His grand -   
 father, a Naval Admiral,farmed about  
 200 acres, most of which is now a golf
 course. As a young boy he remembers   
 the main roads in the area just being 
 dusty tracks.                         
   Shedfield House dates back to the   
 C17th but there is archeological      
 evidence to show that the site was    
 occupied before this. Ditches have    
 been discovered containing large      
 amounts of pottery, some unique to    
 Britain, and a large Roman roof tile. 
   The Commander is still a very active
 member of the community and continues 
 to teach at Sunday School.            </content>
