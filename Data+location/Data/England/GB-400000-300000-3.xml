		<content> The majority of the houses in our area
 are pre-war, semi-detached, council   
 houses.  About 26% of the houses are  
 owner occupied.  Most houses are      
 brick built with tiled roofs.  Severn,
 Thames and Wye Road have steel houses 
 and asbestos roofs, built just after  
 the 2nd World War.  The majority of   
 the houses are 3 bedroomed.           
 Modernization of the Council houses in
 this area has taken place over the    
 last 8 years.  85% of the families    
 have lived in their houses less than  
 15 years.  Most houses have gas       
 heating.  The houses all have gardens.
 Most of them are partially lawned at  
 least, 43% of the households grow some
 vegetables in their gardens.  The     
 total number of houses in the area is 
 2,345.  Each year a number of         
 Fairground Travellers settle for the  
 winter on two sites in the area.      </content>
