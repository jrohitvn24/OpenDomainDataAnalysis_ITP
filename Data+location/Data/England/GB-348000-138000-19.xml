		<title>19Historic buildings</title>
		<content> Glastonbury boasts some interesting   
 historic buildings. The most well     
 known and most frequently visited are 
 the{Abbey Ruins. The Abbot's Kitchen  
 is the most complete building left    
 within the Abbey grounds.             
 The Abbey first stood on the site of a
 church,which according to legend was  
 built by{Joseph of Arimathea}and his  
 followers, of wattle and daub. It was 
 dedicated to the Virgin Mary.  Later  
 on the same spot the Lady Chapel of   
 the Abbey was built. It is believed   
 the building of the Abbey was begun   
 around 1184.  It was the main centre  
 of learning in Southern England. An   
 immensely wealthy foundation, it was  
 one of the last Abbeys to be destroyed
 by{Henry V111 in 1539.}At the East end
 of the Abbey was the{Edgar Chapel     
 built by Abbots Beere and Whiting for 
 the tomb of Edgar, a Saxon king.      </content>
