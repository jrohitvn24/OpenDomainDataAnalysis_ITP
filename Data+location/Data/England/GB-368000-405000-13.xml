		<title>13Old Railway Lines</title>
		<content>    The railways running through       
 Daubhill and Great Lever are now      
 defunct. The one which used to run by 
 Swan Lane Mill was very important and 
 was opened in 1828 before the famous  
 Liverpool/Manchester line, but it is  
 now derelict. It is badly overgrown   
 and a lot of fly-tipping has gone on. 
 It looks a mess! Someone should do    
 something about it. It isn't very nice
 for the people who live nearby.       
    There is another defunct railway   
 line but this looks very attractive.  
 It runs alongside Pennington Road and 
 has been extensively{landscaped}for   
 use as a{recreation area.}This is good
 idea because most of the nearby houses
 are terraced with no gardens and the  
 railway development gives the local   
 people some greenery to look at.      
 No{working lines}run through our area.
