 One of the biggest problems involving 
 children in Kirkby today is drugs.    
 Young children don't just smoke       
 cigarettes and drink any more but     
 take stronger drugs like cannabis and 
 a few even take heroin. Nearly        
 everybody knows somebody who is on    
 drugs and can see the damage that they
 cause. Glue sniffing used to be a very
 big problem but a lot of hard work by 
 teachers and other people involved    
 with children has helped it prevent it
 spreading more. It is hoped that the  
 same effort will also help control the
 drug problem. The Police and teachers 
 and people like that are doing their  
 best but is up to the children to     
 realise how dangerous drugs are.
