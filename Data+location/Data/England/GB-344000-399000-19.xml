		<title>19Linear Park</title>
		<content>   The linear park is an environmental 
 feature which stretches the length of 
 Rainford in a north-south direction   
 from Rainford Junction to Rookery     
 Drive.It follows the line of the old  
 railway which used to run from        
 St.Helens to Rainford but which was   
 closed in the early sixties.          
   It was left untended for many years 
 after the lines were lifted but about 
 five years ago a plan was put forward 
 to change this derelict land into a   
 public amenity.The route was levelled 
 off, it was grassed and shrubs and    
 bushes were planted. A number of play 
 areas were also included in this      
 scheme.                               
   Now that it is completed this       
 landscaped feature provides a pleasant
 walk of about two miles to the        
 residents of Rainford.
