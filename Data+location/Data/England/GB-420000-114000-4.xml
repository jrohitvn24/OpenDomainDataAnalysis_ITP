		<content> The Forestry Commission               
 administers this area which           
 is a part of one of the               
 largest areas of unfenced             
 land in southern England.             
 Ponies and cattle are allowed to roam 
 and they have the right of way on     
 the roads.Car free areas have been    
 created by physically preventing cars 
 from leaving the road by ditching,    
 posts and locked gates, this is       
 essential for the conservation of     
 woodland and wildlife. The area is    
 remote but covered by a web of        
 footpaths.
