		<title>08A VILLAGE CHURCH</title>
		<content> Cranwell village church is dedicated  
 to St. Andrew. It has a Nave, North   
 Aisle, Chancel and South porch. The   
 chancel roof is tiled, and is higher  
 than the flat roof of the Nave.       
 There is a Norman aisle arcade by the 
 side of the nave. The rest of the     
 church was re-built during the early  
 English period. Some of these unusual 
 parts still remain, including the west
 end of the nave, the aisle, the porch 
 and part of the chancel's south wall  
 with doorway.                         
 At the west end of the nave in the    
 gable end is a small stone-bow with a 
 bell, built in the 17th century. The  
 font is a plan early English one, with
 an octagonal bowl, stem and base. It  
 also has a wooden cover. The north    
 wall was re-built, and the church was 
 extensively restored at the beginning 
 of this century.                      </content>
