		<title>07THE VILLAGES OF ORCHESTON</title>
		<content> The twin villages of Orcheston St.    
 George and St. Mary are quiet isolated
 communities because they are some     
 distance away from the main roads that
 cross Salisbury Plain.                
 Although the first bus service was    
 pioneered from Orcheston in 1912, they
 have a service every two or three     
 hours run by the Bristol Omnibus Co.  
 travelling between Bath and Salisbury.
 Looking down over the village from the
 Gibbet, you will notice the abundance 
 of trees, mainly deciduous, scattered 
 around the various properties, and the
 bare stretches of grassland in        
 contrast.                             
 The famous Orcheston grass grows to a 
 height of 12 feet and when the meadows
 are flooded in Winter the grass can be
 seen growing above the water level.   
 Orcheston would be an ideal place to  
 live but for the nearby Army Ranges.  </content>
