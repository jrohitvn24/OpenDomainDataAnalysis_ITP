		<title>01GENERAL INFORMATION</title>
		<content>   The block lies on a north west      
 facing escarpment of the chalk ridge  
 which forms a north easterly extension
 of the Chiltern Hills. The highest    
 point in the SE corner of the block is
 about 137 m. above sea level.         
   About 2 sq. km. in the North West of
 the block is occupied by the town of  
 Baldock. The only other settlement is 
 the village of Clothall in the SE     
 corner of the block. The area is      
 administered by North Herts District  
 Council, and Hertfordshire County     
 Council and is divided between the    
 parishes of Clothall, Weston and      
 Baldock.                              
   The principle communication links   
 are the A1(M), the A505 (Luton to     
 Royston) and the A507 (Baldock to     
 Buntingford). The Cambridge to Kings  
 Cross railway line serves Baldock, but
 outside the area of the block.        </content>
