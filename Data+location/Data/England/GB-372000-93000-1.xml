    {Puddletown, Dorset}is set in a    
 shallow valley of the River Piddle    
 (or Trent) 5 miles east of the county 
 town{Dorchester.}It is surrounded on  
 three sides by undulating farmland and
 by Puddletown Forest to the west.     
     A village with an ancient history,
 Puddletown was mentioned in the       
 original{Domesday Book.}In that time  
 it has slowly grown into a sizeable   
 village of over 1,000 people.The      
 buildings in the area reflect these   
 changes ranging from the 16th century 
 to modern developments.               
     The area is a thriving rural      
 community with {agriculture}being the 
 obvious main influence.Apart from     
 farming the other main forms of       
 employment are concerned with         
 providing services for local people   
 such as shops and garages.            </content>
