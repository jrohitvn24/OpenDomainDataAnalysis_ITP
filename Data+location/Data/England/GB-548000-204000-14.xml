		<content> The library has got 11,000 books and  
 532 tapes. There are 7 partime        
 employees and they have 1,800 readers.
 They do not like to call them         
 customers. They work on Tuesday 3pm   
 until 8pm, Thursday 9am until 8pm,    
 Friday 2pm until 5pm and Saturday 9am 
 until 1pm and then 2pm until 5.30pm.  
 They have got books for all ages. The 
 even have project books. Our school   
 gets a box with a lot of book on 1    
 subject. You get about 30 to 40 books 
 in the box and they are usually good  
 ones. Some of our first and second    
 years walk down to the library once a 
 week.  They go down to find out how it
 works and choose books.
