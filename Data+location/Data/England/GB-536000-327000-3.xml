		<content> At the end of the last century        
 Mr.Arthur Worth helped pioneer the    
 drainage of the marshes,introduce     
 artificial fertilisers,chemical       
 fungicide and virus free potatoes.He  
 built his own railway linking every   
 field to the main line at Fleet.He    
 started with a 6 yr. rotation but now 
 there is an 8 yr.rotation.In 1968 the 
 Holbeach Marsh Cooperative was        
 formed,run by Worths but comprising 15
 local farmers.They grow 1000 acres of 
 potatoes,2500 acres of peas,and cereal
 crops,sugar beet,and in 1985 for the  
 first time "mange tout"peas.They grow 
 for their own freezer company and the 
 big chain stores and for animal       
 feed.They have their own 5 day weather
 station which can predict disease in  
 crops.Nowadays most of their sprays   
 are organic and they provide plenty of
 untouched cover for wild life.        </content>
