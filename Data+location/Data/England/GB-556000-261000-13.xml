		<title>13SWAFFHAM PRIOR HOUSE GARDENS</title>
		<content> Swaffham Prior House has now got      
 approx. 50 acres of land. Some of it  
 is woodland and some is grassland.    
 Until the early 19th. Century the     
 garden was a rectangle of 10 acres. A 
 small park of 45 acres was laid out in
 the early 1800s and an enlargement of 
 the park was made in the 1880s. The   
 total land cover was 140 acres. Also  
 in 1880 an elaborate water garden was 
 created and a line of trees planted.  
 In the garden there is still a        
 waterfall in existance and two Chinese
 Bridges, which the water ran under.   
 The water has dried up now. Five wells
 have also been discovered on the land.
 There is an interesting ice box on the
 land. This consists of a 40 feet deep 
 hole. It was a form of refridgeration 
 and helped preserve the food for the  
 family.
