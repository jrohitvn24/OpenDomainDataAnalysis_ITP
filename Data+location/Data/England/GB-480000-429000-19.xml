 CONCLUSIONS:                          
                                       
 a)  Gilberdyke is a rural village,    
 many adults work on the land or in    
 jobs associated with farming.         
 b)  Many parents are employed in the  
 village in the service industries eg. 
 at the health centre, as shop         
 asssistants or barmaids               
 c)  A large majority of workers who   
 travel outside the village go towards 
 Hull. So, although nearer Goole/Howden
 in actual distance, Gilberdyke has    
 stronger ties with the Hull area.     
 d)  A surprisingly high number of     
 parents work outside the area,        
 travelling long distances to work,    
 although this group does include split
 family details.
