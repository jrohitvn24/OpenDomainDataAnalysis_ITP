		<title>12Farming in Fulford</title>
		<content> When the wheat and barley are         
 harvested they are machine dried and  
 stored in one of four closed barns.   
 Another barn is used to house the     
 dairy herd.The two remaining closed   
 barns are used to store machinery.    
 There are two dutch barns used for    
 storing hay and straw. The farm has   
 its own milking parlour where the cows
 are milked twice each day. The milk is
 used in chocolate production at Holme 
 on Spalding Moor. Like most farmers   
 Mr. Bramley is his own fitter         
 ,mechanic, builder and accountant.    
 Short wave radio operator and computer
 operator might be added to that list  
 shortly. Mrs Bramley can operate most 
 of the farm machinery and drive a     
 tractor. Their children are learning  
 various farming skills and help during
 busy times and holidays.
