		<content> The religious life of the village is  
 served by two churches -St. Andrew's C
 of E.   (1254)  and the Methodist     
 Chapel.  Othe denominations may choose
 to travel to Gainford, a village two  
 miles east of the village.            
 Attendances are moderate for Sunday   
 services. However, the Harvest        
 Festival service held in September is 
 always well attended by young and old 
 alike.  Although once served by       
 its own rector who lived in the       
 nearby rectory, the church is now     
 served by the vicar of Gainford. The  
 old rectory is now a private          
 residence.   Its elevated position was
 said to "command the softest and      
 richest views of the Tees."
