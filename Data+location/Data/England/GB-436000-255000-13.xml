		<title>13THE CHRISTMAS FAIR</title>
		<content>    The Bishops Itchington P.T.A.{     
{Christmas Fair}held in the school hall
 in early December, is always a great  
 success with parents and children.    
 Could this be the lack of entry fee,  
 or the brilliant stalls and games run 
 by{teachers, parents}and{children?}   
 The parents organise the raffle, spin 
 the wheel and refreshments.  The      
 teachers organise games like cut the  
 cards and a game called six dice.  The
 children do games that they bring in  
 like Connect 4 and arcade games.  Mr. 
 Wallace organises the school's{       
{computers.} But the main attraction is
{Santa Claus.}Even l7 year olds queue  
 up to get presents for only 25p.      
 The Christmas Fair opens at about 6.30
 p.m. and closes around 9.00 p.m.      
 About 200 people come to the fair and 
 the school makes about Â£200 to pay for
{school Xmas parties}for the{children.}</content>
