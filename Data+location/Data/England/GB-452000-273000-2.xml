		<title>02The Market Cross</title>
		<content>   The cross must surely be one of the 
 landmarks of the village.It was not   
 until 1265 that Thomas De Astley was  
 first granted a charter by Henry 111  
 to hold a regular market at           
 Hillmorton.The charter allowed a      
 weekly Saturday market to take place. 
   This charter not valied because at  
 the time the king was imprisoned and  
 the barons claimed regal              
 authority.In 1268 after the decisive  
 battle of Evesham which freed the king
 and led to the death of Thomas De     
 Astley.A new charter was proccured    
 from the crown by Thomas De Astley    
 11.He did however change the market   
 day for Wednesday.                    
   In 1335 yet  another Thomas De      
 Astley obtained a fresh charter for a 
 Tuesday market and it is believed that
 he also had the red sandstone cross   
 built.                                </content>
