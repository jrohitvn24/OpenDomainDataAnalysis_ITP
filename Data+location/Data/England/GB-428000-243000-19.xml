		<content> The name {Oxhill}is derived from      
 "Othan Scylf" or "Ohtas Hill" and is  
 pronounced today "Ocs-shull" and is   
 mentioned in the Doomesday Book.It had
 several manors and one was combined   
 with Whatcote before the Normans by   
 Toli.The chief manor was taken by the 
 Normans and afterwards passed through 
 many families including the De Keynes,
 the Catesbys,(of Gunpowder Plot fame),
 and the Owens after the Battle of     
 Bosworth.The Monks of Bordesley also  
 owned land in Oxhill.                 
 The site of the village of Idlicote   
 has changed twice,probably due to the 
 plague.The name is thought to come    
 from cottages,(cote), for pensioners, 
 (idle).The church is Norman.A field on
 Idlicote Hill is called Hospital Field
 probably from the{Battle of Edgehill.}
