 The main feature of interest in the   
 area is{Loppington Village,}which has 
 (in 1985) just been designated a      
{conservation area}because of its      
 quaint character. The village centres 
 around the church, which dates from   
 Norman times. The settlement plan is  
{mediaeval}in origin and there are many
 fine examples of 15th and 16th century
 timber frame cottages including a{    
{cruck cottage.}There are also later   
 buildings in brick, some with fine    
 architectural detailing. There are a  
 number of contemporary houses,        
 including a new scheme of thirteen    
 starter homes now being built and due 
 for completion early in 1986.         
 Loppington boasts the only remaining{ 
{bull baiting ring}in Shropshire, and  
 most of the old{village pound}remains 
 in existence.        continued page 3 </content>
