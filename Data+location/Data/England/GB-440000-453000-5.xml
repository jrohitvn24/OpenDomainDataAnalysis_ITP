		<title>05FARMING</title>
		<content> In{Hunsingore}and{Walshford}almost all
 the land is cultivated.On farms around
{Walshford}and{Hunsingore}there are    
 sheep,lambs,cows bullocks and chickens
 December and January are just about   
 the busiest months of the year because
 it is lambing time and farmers some   
 times have to stay up all night to    
 help the lambs.If the sheep dies the  
 lamb is an orphan and has to be bottle
 fed.Bottle feeding means that you get 
 some powdered milk for lambs, and mix 
 it up with water,put it in a bottle   
 and let the lamb suck it.There are    
 some other kinds of ways to feed them 
 as well.This is a list of the things  
 that are used at harvest time:a       
 combined harvester,a baler,a tractor,a
 trailer and elevator.There are all    
 types of crops grown around here.There
 is barley,wheat,rape,potatoes,mangolds
 and peas.A helicopter sprays the crops</content>
