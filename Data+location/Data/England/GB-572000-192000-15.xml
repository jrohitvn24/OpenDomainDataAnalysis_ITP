		<content> Mr.Thomason farms land in Wickford and
 in Bowers Gifford,Pitsea.He practises 
 mixed farming to make the most of his 
 land.He has 1200 acres altogether.800 
 acres in reserve for pasture.         
  On his Wickford farm he has 200 of   
 his 300 cows,162 are dairy cattle.Most
 of the calves are born in September,  
 October and November.The cows are     
 artificially inseminated.The pregnancy
 lasts for 9 months.When the calves are
 born they stay with their mother for  
 five days.After this they are taken   
 from their mothers and reared on whole
 milk for six weeks.Then they are put  
 on a high energy diet.This is         
 gradually reduced.The diary cow feeds 
 on grass in the summer and in winter  
 on hay.During milking the cows have a 
 concentrated feed of wheat,barley and 
 minerals.Milking takes place twice a  
 day of a morning and in the afternoon.</content>
