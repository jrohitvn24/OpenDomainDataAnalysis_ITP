		<title>01    THE NUTFIELD LINK.</title>
		<content>                                       
     The{Nutfield Link}was started in  
 January{1974.}At first in Nutfield    
 there was only a Church Magazine.Mr.  
 Wakeling, the vicar in{1973,}thought  
 about having a new{community magazine.
 There was a meeting and it was decided
 that{Miss Chandler}would be the Editor
 and she has been so for{11 years.     
     Each month the magazine has a     
 different picture on the cover,which  
 is sometimes a place in Nutfield,a    
 flower or an animal.{                 
{    700 copies }are made each month.In
 the{Link}it mainly tells what is going
 on and what has happened in Nutfield. 
 It is called a{community magazine}    
 because it is made by people in the   
 village. The first{Link}ever published
 was{5p}and now it is{10p.}The price   
 will probably go up next year because 
 of the price of paper.                </content>
