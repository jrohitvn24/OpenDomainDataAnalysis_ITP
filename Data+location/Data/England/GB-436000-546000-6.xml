		<content> Brass bands are a major part of mining
 heritage.Murton has always been a     
 mining community,so it is natural that
 our village has a brass band.It was   
 founded originally as the "Gospel     
 Temperance Blue Ribbon Army Band"in   
 1884.An unwise choice of title led to 
 the change to "Murton Colliery Brass  
 Band" one year later.It has been known
 by this title ever since.Members of   
 mining familes have served in the band
 over the years,often fathers passing  
 on the tradition to sons,or maybe,as  
 recently,to daughters.Todaythere are  
 23 members,21 men and 2 women.About   
 one third of the members have mining  
 connections.One important annual event

 the band accompanied the Colliery     
 Banner to the Miners Gala in nearby   
 Durham.Last year Murtons band was one 
 of those to play in the service in    </content>
