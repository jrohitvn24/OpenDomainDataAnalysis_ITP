 West Cumbria, employment in Silloth is
 good except among young people, as not
 many firms take on school leavers. Out
 of 70 students only 8 gained jobs this
 summer. There are about 2750 people in
 Silloth  and the official unemployment
 figure is about{10 -12 per cent.      
         There are three main areas for
 employment: the  old  aerodrome  site,
 Carr's Mill and dock area,and tourism.
 The three main factories on the former
 aerodrome site are{Yates', M.A.S.,}and
{Cheri-foam Ltd. }Yates' is a  big  new
 factory built about  5  years  ago for
 making copper foil,  some of  which is
 used by M.A.S. The latter make circuit
 boards  from  the  foil and laminates.

 kinds and  shapes.  It is mainly  used
 for all kinds of seating. {Cont'd.
