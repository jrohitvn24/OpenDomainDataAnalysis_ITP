 They had radios, televisions and      
 dances like discos for the teenagers  
 organised by the Youth Club.          
 Television was not so common then and 
 people read more. There were no       
 videos. There were cartoons. After    
 they were 9, children had to do about 
 an hour's homework each night to try  
 to get into the Grammar School.

 We have radios, televisions, discos,  
 computers and videos. We listen to pop
 music on cassettes and music centres. 
 We like programmes like the A Team    
 (adventure story), Tom and Jerry      
 (cartoon) and Crossroads (soap opera).
 There are no dances in the village.   
 Our parents go to the Club and play   
 skittles and darts. Sometimes they go 
 out to other towns. They don't get    
 much time. Some are on committees.    </content>
