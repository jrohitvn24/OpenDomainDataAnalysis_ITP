		<title>01Around Corfe Castle Village</title>
		<content> This area is divided in two by the    
 chalk ridgeway which runs to the ruins
 of Corfe Castle in the West.  To the  
 south is mixed farming. To the north  
 is the heathland and forest running up
 to Wytch Farm - the largest on-shore  
 oil field in Europe.                  
                                       
 The village of Corfe Castle has about 
 1500 inhabitants, working in farming, 
 building, quarrying and the tourist   
 industry.  Local planning regulations 
 insist on the use of Purbeck stone for
 house building.  This, together with  
 the demand for second homes in this   
 picture book village, makes house     
 prices about 10% higher than in       
 surrounding villages.  This is a real 
 problem for young couples, who cannot 
 afford local houses on local incomes.
