		<content>    Only one person that we talked to  
 liked the school dinners.All the      
 others thought that they were         
 horrible.                             
    The pupils are taught              
 English,Maths,History and Topic work. 
    The teachers liked the children but
 prefered working with infants.The     
 children there are generally good but 
 there is always "That one".           
    The children are taken out to many 
 places on trips which they all enjoy. 
    The school does not have an        
 electric bell system -one of the      
 children goes round with a hand bell  
 at home time.                         
    The school has had two terrapin    
 buildings added and a staff room since
 it was built.
