		<title>05A Day In Our School</title>
		<content>   School starts at 9.l5a.m. I come in 
 a taxi at 9 o'clock and play in the   
 playground until the bell goes.  In my
 class when we come in we do 7 a day   
 and diaries first.  Then we go in to  
 assembly.  Afterwards we do sums and  
 some english. Sometimes we watch      
 television.  On Tuesdays and Thursdays
 we have P.E. and on Friday afternoons 
 we have team games.                   
   We have a playtime in the morning   
 and finish for dinner at l2.l5p.m.    
 After dinner we play outside until    
 l.30p.m. Then we come inside and do   
 some more work. Sometimes we do sewing
 or cooking or painting.  We have lots 
 of books to read and look things up   
 in. Some groups can work on the       
 computer.  I like the computer best.  
 At 3.45p.m. I go home in the taxi.    
 Sometimes I go to play at Duncan's    
 house.                                </content>
