		<title>09Alston Sutton Farm</title>
		<content> Alston Sutton farm also has many pigs.
 There are 250 sows, 13 boars and 2250 
 piglets. Every sow has two litters    
 each year with about 13 piglets in    
 each litter. Apart from looking after 
 the animals the farmer has lots of    
 other work to do. In spring he cuts   
 the grass for hay and silage. When    
 making silage the grass is cut and    
 left to  dry for 24 hours. A tractor  
 and trailer takes the grass to the    
 farmyard and it is tipped into a pile.
 It is then covered by polythene and   
 old tyres to keep it dry. The cattle  
 eat it in Winter when the grass does  
 not grow in the fields.The farmer also
 grows maize, sweetcorn and barley on  
 his farm. A farmers life is a very    
 busy one indeed!
