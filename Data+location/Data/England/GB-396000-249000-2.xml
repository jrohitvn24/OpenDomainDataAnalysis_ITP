		<title>02GENERAL LANDSCAPE.</title>
		<content>   The landscape around the village is 
 mainly open views of rolling hills    
 divided into fields of 6 acres or     
 more by hedges of hawthorn or wire    
 fences. In places trees have been     
 allowed to grow up in the hedgerows.  
 Many fields are left down to pasture  
 for the cattle and the sheep, but     
 about half are cropped for cereals,   
 broad beans or oilseed rape. The      
 meandering paths of Whitsun Brook and 
 its tributaries are marked by the     
 lines of willows and bushes, providing
 a vital shelter belt for wildlife.    
  Bishampton church at the northern end
 of the village can be seen from most  
 of the area whereas the 13th century  
 Throckmorton Chaplery (a virtually    
 unrestored church) is sited in a field
 and is a much less prominent feature.
