		<title>12Sports Facilities in Kirkby</title>
		<content> Apart from the many things you can do 
 at Kirkby Stadium there are several   
 other forms of recreational activity  
 in Kirkby. There is a public swimming 
 pool which contains a baby pool, a big
 pool, a diving pool and a sauna.      
 Another facility that Kirkby offers is
 a BMX course. You can also join many  
 sports clubs. Ones that I know of are 
 tap dancing, ju-jitsu, cubs, scouts,  
 brownies and guides. I have joined a  
 swimming club and I go to it on a     
 Monday.                               
 In a survey that I did with my class  
 we interviewed 99 people and asked    
 whether they took part in any sport in
 Kirkby. Only 36 said that they did. We
 found out that the most popular sport 
 was swimming and when the pool        
 instructors were interviewed they said
 that over 2000 people use the large   
 swimming pool each week.              </content>
