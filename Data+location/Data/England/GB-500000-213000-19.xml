		<content>{Studham School in the late 1940's and 
{early 1950's.                         
 The Old School and School House were  
 situated just past the present school 
 gates at the bottom of the hill to the
 right.The headmistress was a lady     
 called Miss Stallworthy, who still    
 lives in the village.She was assisted 
 by a lady called Miss Hughes.         
 The Old School House was divided in   
 two by a large folding screen with    
 approximately one third of the        
 building being used as an infant      
 class taken by Miss Hughes. She used  
 to cycle every day from Gaddesden Row 
 on a cycle that looked about 50 years 
 old.If you were naughty in her class  
 she would rap your knuckles with a    
 ruler edge_wise on. At the age of 7   
 you moved into the big class taken by 
 Miss Stallworthy. The school was      
 heated by an old iron coke stove.cont </content>
