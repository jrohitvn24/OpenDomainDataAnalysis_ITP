		<content>  After school and at weekends I       
 sometimes play on the park. My house  
 overlooks Tonge Moor Park. It is 66,  
 Parkdale Rd. In the summer there is a 
 club on the park. Here you can play   
 snooker and tabletennis. Sometimes a  
 mini-bus takes us on a day outing to  
 Blackpool. At weekends I often go to  
 the leisure centre in town. I go there
 with a friend and we play squash,     
 raquetball, football and badminton.   
 Sometimes I go on outings with my     
 family. We go to Rivington, Blackpool 
 and Southport and we travel by car.   
 When it's raining we stay inside and  
 play on the computer with games, play 
 snooker or watch television. When my  
 mum and dad can get babysitters for me
 and my brothers  they visit my auntie 
 in Windermere.  On Sundays we go to   
 St. Augustine's Church in the morning.
 Mum goes to mass at night.            </content>
