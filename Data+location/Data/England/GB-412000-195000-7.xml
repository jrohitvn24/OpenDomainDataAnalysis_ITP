		<content>  {Kempsford}church is at the east end 
 outside this survey. {Castle Eaton}and
{Marston Meysey,}both{Wiltshire}       
 villages, are in the Deanery of       
{Fairford}and the Diocese of{          
{Gloucester.}Their churches (St.Mary   
 the Virgin and St James) have been    
 combined with{Meysey Hampton}under the
 latter's incumbent who conducts a     
 service at each church each Sunday.   
 There is no chapel and Non-Conformists
 travel outside the area.              
    The churches with electoral rolls  
 of 30 and 25 respectively are well    
 cared for and the graveyards neatly   
 maintained. St Mary's has volunteer   
 rotas for mowing the surrounds,       
 cleaning the church and providing     
 flowers. There are two churchwardens, 
 a Parochial Church Council of 11, a   
 choir, bellringers and a small Sunday 
 School.                               </content>
