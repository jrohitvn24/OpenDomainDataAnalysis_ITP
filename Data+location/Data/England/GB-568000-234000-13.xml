		<title>13THE CHURCH (C of E)</title>
		<content> The church of St.John the Evangelist  
 in Cornish Hall End is a fairly small 
 brick building,dating from about 1840.
 It originally had a small tower with 2
 pinnacles on either side of the west  
 end.In 19ll the church was'beautified'
 by courtesy of the local squire.Oak   
 pews, new pulpit and a stained glass  
 window in the east end were installed.
 Also a larger tower built to replace  
 the small one.The belfry houses only 1
 bell. The pinnacles were removed in   
 about l965 when they became unsafe _  
 a young man in the village had this as
 his first job for a local builder.    
 There is a tiny chapel,unused now, to 
 the south of the chancel.             
                                       
 The churchyard is now closed for      
 burials,the cemetery being a quarter  
 of a mile away,on the road to Tinkers 
 Green.                                </content>
