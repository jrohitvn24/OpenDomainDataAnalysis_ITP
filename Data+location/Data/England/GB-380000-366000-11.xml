		<content> Entertainment was very mixed. It came 
 in the form of theatre visits,        
 concerts, eating out and various      
 sporting activities, such as fishing, 
 tennis and horse racing. However,     
 these are all activities in which one 
 has to travel, in some cases up to    
 15-20 miles, therefore a car is       
 essential when living in this area for
 there are no bus services or shops.   
 Instead mobile shops and library have 
 to visit this village once or twice a 
 week. There is however, a milk and    
 postal delivery each day. Swettenham  
 village is the proud owner of two     
 public houses, no-one therefore goes  
 thirsty !                             
 Out of all the houses involved, all   
 had electricity, water and telephone. 
 No-one had gas because there was no   
 pipe-line within the area.
