		<title>18Mammals around Stonegate</title>
		<content> There are many kinds of mammal to be  
 found around Stonegate.               
 In the summer bats can be seen late in
 the evening.Some bats live in the     
 church.                               
 Poultry are kept on many of the farms 
 and so,because of this,there are many 
 foxes.At least two of our hens are    
 killed by foxes each year.            
 Badgers are not often seen or heard.  
 The last time I saw badgers,I saw two 
 badgers fighting,but when they saw me 
 they ran off in opposite directions.  
 Rabbits are common around Stonegate.  
 One of our neighbours feeds the wild  
 rabbits,which have now become quite   
 tame,even coming right up to the front
 door to be fed.A rabbit has dug a     
 burrow next to the house,and raised   
 two litters of baby rabbits in one    
 year.
