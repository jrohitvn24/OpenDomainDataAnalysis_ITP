		<title>14EMPLOYMENT IN BROOK.</title>
		<content>   As{BROOK}is only a small village it 
 does not offer a large range of       
 employment to the young people in the 
 area.                                 
   A certain amount of jobs are        
 available in the local farms,but this 
 is not enough to supply the  local    
 working population with an income.This
 means that many people move to other  
 areas through necessity or choice.The 
 village therefore suffers from a lack 
 of young people.                      
   Those who choose to remain in Brook 
 are forced to travel out of the       
 village to find employment.This means 
 they must either rely on the          
 infrequent public transport or own    
 their own transport.                  
   Therefore BROOK is a problem area   
 for employment on the{ISLE OF WIGHT.}
