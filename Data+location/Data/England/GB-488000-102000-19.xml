		<title>19MERSTON AIRFIELD</title>
		<content> During the war years 1941-1943        
 there was a great expansion in the    
 operations of Tangmere Airfield.      
{Merston Airfield} was one of the six  
 satellite landing grounds to be used  
 when Tangmere Airfield came under     
 heavy attack.                         
 124 Squadron came to Merston from Lydd
 and New Romney for winter quarters in 
 1943/1944 - everything being          
 transported by road.   247, 181 and   
 182 Squadrons also used Merston.   The
 pilots and ground crews lived in      
 Shopwyke, Drayton and Westbourne      
 Houses, only using the Airfield for   
 operations.   Allied Airforce         
 personnel were also housed in nearby  
 North Mundham.                        
 The Airfield, disused for many years, 
 is now agricultural land although the 
 runways and some shelters can still be
 seen.                                 </content>
