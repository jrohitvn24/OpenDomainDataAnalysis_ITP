During the weekend of May 18th and     
19th 1985 about eight hundred Jehovah's
witnesses came from Canada,Jamaica,    
Africa and Europe to build a new       
Kingdom Hall in Montague Street.The    
foundations had been laid in April     
1985 but the rest of the building work 
was completed in one and a half days.At
least one hundred people worked all    
through Saturday night. Everyone had a 
job to do including first aid and      
making refreshments.The people looked  
like ants hard at work.The building was
finished on Sunday afternoon at        
4.15p.m for use complete  with         
gardens,  central heating, plumbing,   
electicity and carpets.
