		<content>  The block contains approximately half
 of the town of{Newent}and extends into
 the surrounding countryside to the    
 north and east.                       
  The town is old and is mentioned in  
 the Domesday Book as{'Noent'}(New-    
 Place)It is 9 miles west of Gloucester
 and is the social centre for north    
 -west Gloucestershire. Once a market  
 town, it retains much of the character
 of its early days, with a long main   
 street bordered with half-timbered and
 old brick buildings. In recent years  
 modern housing estates have been built
 reflecting the now mainly residential 
 nature of the Town whose population in
 1985 is nearly 5000.                  
  To the north the countryside is noted
 for its light soil and horticultural  
 industry while to the east are medium 
 sized traditional mixed farms and the 
 village of Upleadon.                  </content>
