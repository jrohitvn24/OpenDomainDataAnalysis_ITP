		<title>04TORONTO - PAST &amp; PRESENT</title>
		<content> This is a township in the Parish of   
 St. Andrew Auckland, and was once     
 called Newton Cap.  A local business- 
 man called Stobart, part owner of the 
 local coal mine, and also on the Board
 of the Stockton &amp; Darlington railway, 
 was visiting his daughter in Toronto, 
 in Canada in 1861 when news came that 
 a rich seam had been discovered.  He  
 immediately decided to change the name
 of the mining village to Toronto.  The
 operation reduced gradually until the 
 mine finally closed in 1924.  Since   
 when the village has lost its school  
 and village church.  All that is left 
 is a village store and public house.  
 Now the famous viaduct (circa 1850)   
 and a noble monument to the Railway   
 Age is under threat of demolition by  
 Durham County Council, a matter of    
 great concern to the local residents  
 who are rganising to stop these plans.</content>
