		<title>10Game keeper's house</title>
		<content>The old game keeper's house was built  
between 1820 and 1840. It was part of  
the Wantage Estate and was built by    
Lady Overstone. The stables and the    
kennels for the hounds used for        
hunting by guests of the Wantages were 
next door. The gateway at the top of   
the road was one of the ways to the    
Wantage's Estate.The Pytchley Gates    
were the main entrance to the House.   
The house stands in four acres of land 
including a small wood behind the      
building. There is a long drive leading
to the house. It is about five minutes 
walking distance from the village      
school.
