		<title>17THE RIBBLE MARSHES</title>
		<content> Part of our survey area is covered by 
 the Ribble marshes. In all, this      
 National Nature Reserve covers an area
 of 2302 hectares of saltmarshes and   
 intertidal flats. It occupies a key   
 position in the Ribble Estuary which  
 is of international importance for    
 birds. In 1979, the Nature Conservancy
 Council purchased 2182 hactares toi   
 save it from being embanked and       
 converted to arable land. 120 hactares
 of the part of Hesketh Out Marsh was  
 embanked in 1980. About half of the   
 area is greenmarsh and is grazed by   
 cattle during the summer and half is  
 mudflats and sandbanks. The reserve   
 has a full time warden and a team of  
 voluntary wardens. It is managed by   
 the north west region of the Nature   
 Conservancy Council. The reserve was  
 aquired to protect the habitat of     
 waders, ducks, geese, gulls and terns </content>
