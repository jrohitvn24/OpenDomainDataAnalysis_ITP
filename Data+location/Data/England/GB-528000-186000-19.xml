		<content> HIGHGATE VILLAGE is at the top of     
Highgate Hill and is one of the best   
remaining examples in London of an     
18th Century village.Many of the       
buildings are Georgian paticularly     
around the Green and Pond Square.      
The Grove is a fine example of a       
Georgian Terrace.Samuel Taylor         
Coleridge lived at No 3.There are      
some notable houses including          
Lauderdale House and Widanhurst.       
 HIGHGATE CEMETERY can be found nearby.
This famous 19th Century cemetery was  
landscaped to seem more like a country 
walk than a graveyard.Designed to take 
the overspill from graveyards in London
it contains some famous people         
including Christina Rosetti,George     
Eliot and Michael Faraday.Many people  
go to the new part of the cemetery to  
see the monument to Karl Marx,the      
political and economic philosopher.    </content>
