		<title>16GAMES AT SCHOOL</title>
		<content> A favourite playground game is        
 hopscotch. The playground has numbered
 squares painted on it. You throw a    
 stone. The stone must land on the     
 number you are up to. Then you hop on 
 all the numbers except the one with   
 the stone on it, you jump over this   
 square. You pick up the stone on the  
 way back and then throw the stone onto
 the next number. If your stone does   
 not land on the number you are up to, 
 you miss a go. Another favourite      
 school game is called Tig. You run    
 after a person and tap him on the     
 back. Then he must chase people. We   
 all like ball games. Our playground is
 marked out as a netball court. The    
 boys love to play football and use one
 of the school walls as a goal. We have
 a pitch but even though it has been   
 drained, it is usually waterlogged in 
 winter. Skipping is very popular.     </content>
