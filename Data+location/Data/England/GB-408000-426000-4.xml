		<content>{Northowram}and{Sibden}contain many old
 houses, going back as far as the 15th 
 century. Most of the old houses were  
 farms or tradesmens houses. They were 
 all built out of the local stone,     
 known as{Yorkshire Sandstone,}which is
 still quaried in the area. In the 19th
 century many cottages were built to   
 house the mill workers. They were     
 again built out of local sandstone and
 many are still standing today,        
 especially near where the old mills   
 useed to be. Most modern houses are   
 made of concrete blocks or bricks and 
 because the{Shibden Valley}is a       
 conservation area there is no new     
 building. In{Northowram}there are     
 several "new estates". Of the 18      
 children in our class one lives in    
 Staups Hall,2 live in farms, 6 live in
 old cottages and 9 in houses built    
 since 1945.                           </content>
