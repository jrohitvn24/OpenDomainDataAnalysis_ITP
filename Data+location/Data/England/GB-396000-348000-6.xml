		<title>06Pollution from animal farm</title>
		<content> ohn Pointon's animal by products farm 
 s the only factory in the area around 
Wetley Rocks &amp; Cheddleton.The factory  
is near to houses and the residents    
compain that the site is too near and  
that the smell,generated from the      
factory is appalling.                  
"The factory is a pain in the neck"    
say the residents. They claim that the 
smell is so bad that they cannot have  
their windows open. The smell is caused
by the burning of waste that is left   
over from the animals. The residents   
would like to see the factory moved or 
closed down but unless the factory is  
moved right out into the country there 
doesnot seem to be another place for   
it, and so it looks as if the residents
of Cheddleton will have to put up with 
it, for the time being, anyway.
