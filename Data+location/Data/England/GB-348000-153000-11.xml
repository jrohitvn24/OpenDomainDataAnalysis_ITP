		<title>11CAVING ON MENDIP</title>
		<content>    The Mendips are one of the most    
 popular caving areas in Britain-within
 easy reach of London via the M4 and   
 Birmingham &amp; the north via the M5.    
 There are a number of local clubs and 
 other groups such as schools &amp; Scouts.
 The spot is becoming more popular &amp;   
 pressure on some caves is severe.     
 Congestion, litter, grafffitti and    
 destruction of formations are problems
 which clubs are trying to solve.      
    This block contains three          
 spectacular caves-Manor Farm, Longwood
 Swallet &amp; Rhino Rift. Many are locked 
 for safety and prevention of          
 vandalism. These are caves for the    
 caver not the tourist.                
    Anyone caving on Mendip needs to   
 take the correct equipment, an        
 experienced leader &amp; leave a message  
 with someone.The{Mendip Rescue
