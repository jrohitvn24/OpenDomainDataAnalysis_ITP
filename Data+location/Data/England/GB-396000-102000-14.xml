		<title>14THE CHILBRIDGE FARM</title>
		<content>{NATURE WALKS                          
 We walked along quiet farm tracks with
 layed hedgerows filled with nettles   
 and wild flowers{.}Young trees are    
 cut in half downwards,pushed over and 
 woven together.We saw                 
 pheasants,partridge,rabbits,wild birds
 and butterflies.We reached{Kingston   
{Coppe}where birch,beech,elm and other 
 oak trees were wild.                  
     At{ Chilbridge}Farm cows grazed in
 fields on one side.1st on the other   
 side grew barley and the other field  
 is wheat.We saw fresian calves in the 
 barn.Then{Mr.Richard's}and{Mr.Croft   
 showed us  the farm.We climbed a      
 ladder to see the rotory milking      
 parlour.We watched how sileage was    
 made.The farm is unusual in that it   
 also processes its own feedstock from 
 its crops.Piglets screamed and        
 squiggled.                            </content>
