		<content> Northampton does not have its own     
 specific fashion trends, but follows  
 that of other major towns and cities. 
 There are a number of different rival 
 groups of which Casuals hold the      
 majority.  The rest of the minority   
 are groups like Punks, Greabos,Mods,  
 and Rockabillies.                     
   White jackets, Summer boots, any    
 pastel colours,and hats, are just some
 of the present trends. But fashion is 
 always changing from month to month.  
   Music is also something that varies 
 a great deal. There is a Northampton  
 based group called "The Jets"who base 
 their music around rock and roll,and  
 have made themselves known in the     
 British Pop Charts.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
