		<title>19My Typical Day.</title>
		<content> I woke up on Sunday Morning around    
 8.30 am and listened to the News on   
 the radio. I got washed and cleaned my
 teeth. Then I had my breakfast. Then  
 when I had finished, I went out side  
 then Andrew Beeton came to play . Then
 we went inside and went up stairs to  
 play snooker. I won easily. I said "Do
 you want another game?" He said "No.  
 Let's go in the water." So we went    
 outside in the water. We went under   
 the tunnel. I had found some duck eggs
 before so we went up to look at the   
 eggs.The mother was still on the nest.
 When we had looked at the nest we went
 back up the tunnel and went in the    
 house to look at the time. It was time
 for him to go . He went home . Then I 
 had my dinner.
