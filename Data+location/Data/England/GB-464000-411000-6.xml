 increasing. Thornhills Frozen Chicken 
 Factory has been closed down. Some    
 shops have been closed during the     
 miners strike,(1984/85) because of all
 the vandalism. The Miners Welfare has 
 been helping the miners on strike by  
 giving food to them every Saturday.   
 There have also been soup kitchens    
 everyday.
