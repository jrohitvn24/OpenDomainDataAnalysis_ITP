 Lady Katherne Leveson,a daughter of   
 the Earl of Dudley,died in 1674       
 leaving all her estates, including    
 Temple Balsall, to trustees to erect  
 and endow a free school for twenty    
 poor boys from Balsall .The first Head
 Master was Robert Chamberlain and the 
 first school boys came in the year    
 1679. The first School was in what is 
 now the Prayer Room in the Almshouses.
 In the year 1876 the old part of the  
 present buildings were built. They are
 now classes two, four and the Library.
 They were Upper and Lower Infant and  
 Upper and Lower Junior. The hall and  
 old Staff room were built in the early
 60s. The newest building dates from   
 1981. We have six teachers, and four  
 classes at present for 100 children.
