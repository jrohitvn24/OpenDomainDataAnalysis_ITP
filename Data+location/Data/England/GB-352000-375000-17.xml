		<title>17MR. GREENLEAVES (1)</title>
		<content>  Mr. Greenleaves, at 84, has lived in 
 Frodsham for over half his life. He   
 was born and lived in Ashley Gardens, 
 the middle child of five. His father  
 was an insurance collector calling at 
 Frodsham, Helsby, Kingsley, Dutton and
 Sutton Weaver on foot. His mother     
 stayed at home to care for the family.
 Their home comprised a kitchen and    
 three bedrooms upstairs. The W.C. was 
 in the yard. He attended school       
 behind the Church Hall and after 18   
 months (in standard II) he was one of 
 8 chosen to eventually sit the 11+.   
 Immediately moved to St.III to work   
 harder. The headteacher took the      
 scholarship for extra training. No    
 talking permitted in class, the       
 punishment being the cane _not often  
 used but it "was there". In St.VI the 
 poor readers spent their lunchtime    
 being helped by more able pupils.     </content>
