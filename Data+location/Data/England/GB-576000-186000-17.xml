		<title>17Life styles in Sth Benfleet.</title>
		<content> A popular pastime is gardening,       
 despite the fact that in South        
 Benfleet the soil is clay,which is    
 heavy in winter and dry as rock in    
 summer."Stiff,tough,dumb,numb and     
 impervious",a local farmer once       
 described it.Most houses have gardens 
 to the front and rear and many gardens
 have large lawns and ornamental flower
 beds.The growing of fruit and         
 vegetables for personal consumption is
 popular again,as people are becoming  
 aware of the harmful additives in     
 shop_bought food,but young people in  
 particular like the convenience of    
 buying meals out, which they can do in
 "Wimpy_Bars",Public Houses and        
 Restaurants or to take prepared meals 
 home,for which the numerous "Take_    
 aways" cater.Apart from Fish and Chip 
 shops,there are several Indian and    
 Chinese "Take_Aways" and Restaurants. </content>
