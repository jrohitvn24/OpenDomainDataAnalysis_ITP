		<title>03A FARM IN 1985.</title>
		<content>   My friend and I were interested in  
 farming in 1985.So we went to Manor Fa
 rm to ask a few questions.            
                                       
 Manor Farm is a farm in our village.  
 The farmhouse was built in 1712 but he
 does not know how old the farm is.    
 He has lived there for five and a half
 years.                                
                                       
 The farmer has only sheep and a dog at
 the moment.He has 550 ewes plus lambs 
 but sometimes he has cattle to fatten.
 The cattle he has are kept for beef   
 and the sheep are for wool and lamb.  
 He farms 295 acres but 126 acres are  
 for wheat.                            
                                       
 He has not had any barns rebuilt      
 lately.He uses modern machinary for   
 his farm.                             
                                       </content>
