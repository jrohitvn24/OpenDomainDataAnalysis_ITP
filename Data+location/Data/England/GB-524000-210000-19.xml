		<content> Holwell JMI School is amongst six     
 schools within Hertfordshire which    
 have taken part in a two year         
 (1984-85) Project on the use of       
 computers in Primary Schools. The     
 Project was initiated by the Advisory 
 Unit for Computer-Based Education in  
 Hatfield and was intended to look at  
 the ways in which children and        
 teachers use computers for the        
 purposes of handling information in   
 school-based project work. Amongst the
 topics covered in Holwell School      
 during the two years are: paper,      
 sliding, traffic accidents, accidents 
 in school, the history and the people 
 of Welwyn Garden City. The Project was
 the first of its kind in the country  
 and was financed by Herts CC and the  
 Cowper foundation.
