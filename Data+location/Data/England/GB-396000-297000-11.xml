		<content>  The existing church building is      
 Victorian gothic in style. It was     
 consecrated in 1867, replacing the    
 previous building which it was said   
 looked too much like a factory and has
 shown signs of rapid detoriation since
 its completion in 1750. The present   
 vicar is the Rev. T. Newman who       
 retires in November after 20 years of 
 service. The church was dedicated to  
 St. Giles a 7th. century hermit.      
  The cruciform design of the church   
 can hold 1000 worshippers and consists
 of a spacious nave and chancel, both  
 with aisles, and north and south      
 transcepts.
