		<title>02RAILWAY SERVICES, RUGELEY</title>
		<content> Rugeley Trent Valley Station is about 
 one mile out of town halfway to Colton
 village. The main traffic is Inter-   
 City passenger services connecting    
 London with Scotland and the North    
 West. These trains do not stop at     
 Rugeley. The main freight is coal from
 Leicestershire and Cannock to Rugeley 
 power stations. The remainder is mixed
 freight and Freightliner services.    
 Local passenger trains cater for      
 commuters to Stafford and stations to 
 Rugby. Four local trains each way stop
 at Rugeley per day. The local         
 passenger services are used by few    
 people because it is cheaper in most  
 cases to go by bus and the station is 
 so far out of town. The Trent Valley  
 line through Rugeley was electrified  
 under the 1950/60 West Coast Mainline 
 electrification programme.
