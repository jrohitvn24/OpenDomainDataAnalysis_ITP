		<title>02An introduction to Whitwell</title>
		<content> Whitwell village  was called Hwitan   
  wyles great in 942 a.d.It is an      
 ancient agricultural village          
 mentioned in the{Domesday Book}and    
 later part of the Duke of Portland's  
 Welbeck estate.It gets its name       
  from a tributory of Millwood Brook   
  and a passage between the            
 hills.Within the parish are two main  
 ways of life,the old agriculture and  
 the newer mining. The colliery was    
 started in 1890, and the population of
 the village has risen steadily from   
 2,000 in 1881 to 4,603 in 1981. The   
 number of houses in Whitwell has      
 probably doubled in fifty years due to
 birth-rate figures.The village still  
 contains a colliery band and cricket  
 club.The champion snooker player      
  Mr.Joe Davis was born in whitwell    
 as well as Mr.Les Jackson the         
 Derbyshire and  England cricketer.    </content>
