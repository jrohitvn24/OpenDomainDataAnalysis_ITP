		<title>15HOUSING/VANDALISM</title>
		<content> In the area where I live, St. Giles   
 estate, the houses are terrible. All  
 of the windows are smashed and most of
 the gardens are like rubbish dumps.  I
 am lucky because I live in a street   
 called the Oval and that is quite a   
 good street.  Just a few minutes walk 
 from where I live they have just built
 some new houses but recently they have
 all been vandalised.  All over most of
 Lincoln the houses are quite posh and 
 neat but about 30% of them have been  
 vandalised.  There are quite a lot of 
 very old houses in Lincoln and many of
 them are in very good condition.      
 Altogether though, Lincoln is a very  
 neat and tidy city and the housing is 
 very good.
