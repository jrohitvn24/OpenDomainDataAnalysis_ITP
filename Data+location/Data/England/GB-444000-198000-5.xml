		<title>05 LANDUSE OF GREAT PARK FARM</title>
		<content>     It is a mixed farm.The CROPS grown
this year are:cereals 150 hectares(ha) 
(Wheat 100-barley 50)cashcrops;potatoes
cashcrop 16(ha); maize 6(ha)and the    
rest is mostly permanent and temporary 
pasture,used mostly for silage and hay.
     There was much area taken up by   
BUILDINGS.A converted aircraft hanger  
was used for storing machinery and the 
sheep used it during the lambing       
season.Potatoes and cereals are stored 
in a building which has ducts under the
floor through which air can be blown to
keep the produce dry and  stop it      
rotting.                               
     At one time the farm was one of   
Europe's leading poultry producers;the 
sheds remain,but few birds are now     
kept.                                  
     HOUSING includes the family       
home(200 years old) and labourers tied
