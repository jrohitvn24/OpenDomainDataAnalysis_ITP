		<content>  Wayfarers Arcade is a typical        
 Victorian structure of Lord Street.It 
 has an ornamental glass roof and is   
 built off the main street.The arcade  
 contains a wide variety of goods.     
  A survey of ten people was carried   
 out,the results being:                
  Eight out of ten people did not come 
 from Southport.Six people were        
 visiting for the first time.Two people
 visited regularly.Two other people    
 came every two to three months.Two    
 people came to buy,the others to      
 glance.The main liking for the arcade 
 was the relaxed atmosphere and quality
 of shops.Most of the shopkeepers found
 Summer/Autumn sales and Christmas the 
 busiest period of the year,weekends   
 being the busiest period of the week. 
  Improvements suggested were more     
 flowers,painting regularly,and balcony
 repairs.                              </content>
