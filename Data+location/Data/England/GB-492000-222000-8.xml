		<title>08PARKS IN LEIGHTON BUZZARD</title>
		<content>  The two parks in Leighton Buzzard are
 well kept by the Town Council, the    
 grass is cut regularly and the flower 
 gardens tended.                       
  Pages Park is well set out, divided  
 into two parts by an avenue of trees. 
 On one side are the sports facilities,
 these include a cricket pitch, tennis 
 courts, football and hockey pitches.  
 The other side of the park has a      
 childrens playground which has swings,
 roundabouts, seesaws and a slide.     
                                       
  Parsons Close does not have the      
 sporting facilities as found at Pages 
 Park but has a paddling pool for the  
 children in summer and a bandstand.   
  People visiting the parks may make   
 use of the facilities, make their own 
 amusement, sit or walk. Dogs are taken
 for walks but this causes controversy 
 because of the mess they make.        </content>
