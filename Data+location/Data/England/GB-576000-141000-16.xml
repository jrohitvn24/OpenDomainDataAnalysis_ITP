		<title>16Footpaths Around Staplehurst</title>
		<content>   A glance at the map will tell the   
 walker that the countryside around    
 Staplehurst has a wealth of footpaths.
 These are regularly walked by the     
 local footpath society who publish    
 maps and guides for circular walks. In
 1977 the Jubilee walks were devised   
 from existing paths with any gaps     
 filled in by courtesy of landowners.  
  The walks are rewarding in that local
 farming methods  being fairly tradit- 
 ional,field sizes have remained small 
 and therefore hedgerows and trees are 
 plentiful and always close at hand.   
 This is the intimate countryside in   
 which one can easily lose oneself and 
 is such a contrast to the Kentish mini
 prairies produced by some farmers. It 
 is further enhanced by the numerous   
 picturesque dew ponds, scattered      
 orchards and now,sadly,only the occas-
 ional hop field.                      </content>
