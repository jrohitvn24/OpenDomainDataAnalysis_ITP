		<title>17Council Estates - Paignton</title>
		<content> Torbay Borough Council opened in 1980 
 the first seventy council houses that 
 were to become the Great Parks Estate.
 This new Council estate has medium    
 density housing based upon the central
 court system surrounded by clusters of
 houses.                               
 The houses are two storeyed and  brick
 built.                                
 Each of the court areas have a small  
 play area, though the residents       
 feel it is far too small and also     
 complain that there are no shops on   
 the estate or a community centre, and 
 this on an estate that is many miles  
 from the centre of Paignton.          
 Many of the children who were involved
 in this Domesday project in fact live 
 on the Great Parks estate.            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
