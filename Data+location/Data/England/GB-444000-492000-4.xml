 On Tuesday,18 June 1985 Mr Davison who
 is Head Forester over N.Yorkshire     
 visited our school and gave us the    
 following information on the large    
 forest in our area.                   
 Silton Forest was bought in 1954 from 
 Mr Fleming who owned the Silton       
 Estate.Most of the forest was rough   
 grazing for sheep farming consisting  
 of heather,bracken,juncas             
 grass,bilberry and thorn bushes.There 
 were 8 hectares of standing crop      
 consisting of European Larch  and     
 Scots Pine which were not in first    
 class condition and had been planted  
 in 1939.Soils were mostly surface     
 water gleys,peaty clays and brown     
 earth.Iron pan soil is what the forest
 is mostly made up of.The surface is   
 ploughed and drained and the iron pan 
 broken up before planting.            </content>
