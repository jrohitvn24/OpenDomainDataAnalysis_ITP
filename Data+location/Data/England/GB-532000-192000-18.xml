		<title>18HOW I SPEND MY SPARE TIME</title>
		<content>     In my spare time I play cricket   
 with my two brothers, or go to the    
 library. On Sunday I go Sunday School 
 with my friends. Yesterday I went     
 Sunday School, we had our Sport day.  
 It was fun and I came 1st. in 2 races.
 I really enjoy gong to Sunday school  
 because we learn about Jesus.         
     At home I work for a few minutes  
 and go to play in my garden. On my    
 road it is rather narrow, and my      
 garden is very big. I don't like my   
 road because it is so narrow and you  
 can't hardly park on it.              
 In my garden there are two separate   
 parts, one is for planting vegetables,
 and the other for playing. I have     
 planted some Garlic and it has fully  
 grown. I really enjoy doing gardening 
 because there is so much to do.
