		<content>    To reach Astwick village we went   
through a field. We got to a gate and a
wall which is the remaining part of    
the old town hovel. It must have been  
quite   big; we could see the          
foundations. The wall was 1.25m high   
and was made of grey stones stacked in 
a brick design. There were bumps all   
over the field with protruding stones  
arranged in lines so we could make out 
the foundations of the old cottages.   
They were bigger than we had expected. 
   To reach the old fish pond we had to
climb over a barbed wire fence and     
crosss  a marshy riverbed which still  
had tall reeds growing in it. They     
were taller than I and I am 1.30m      
tall. From there we could see a        
shallow oval-shaped dip which was the  
fish pond. It was marshy with little   
pools in it and lots of reeds. The     
trees around it were very dense.       </content>
