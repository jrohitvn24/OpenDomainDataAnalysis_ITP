		<content> Wool arrives at the factory in large  
 pressed_packed bales.These can        
 sometimes weigh up to{1000}pounds. The
 wool is  now ripped open and mixed    
 together.This is known as blending.   
 From here it is sent through a        
 polythene pipe to be scoured.After it 
 has been scoured it is sprayed lightly
 with a special wool oil.The next      
 process is known as carding.This means
 that wool is rubbed in to a weak      
 thread.From here it is spun which     
 gives the wool extra strength.Now the 
 single yarn is twisted with another   
 piece and then it is wound onto       
 skeins.This is known as hanking.The   
 yarn is made in this way so that it   
 may be strung  onto rods and dipped   
 into large vats to be dyed.From here  
 the yarn is dryed in a large dryer.The
 last process is to put the yarn onto  
 large cones which are then bagged.    </content>
