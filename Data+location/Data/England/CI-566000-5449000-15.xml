		<content>  The area covered by our survey is    
 largely rural, with most of the land  
 being used for crops and grassland for
 the dairy herds.                      
   Recently there has been some        
 development of housing in the area    
 especially to the west as this part   
 lies almost next to the town of St    
 Helier.                               
  During the 1930's many new estates   
 were built. A typical example of this 
 is Langley Park. Langley Park is a    
 road with detached houses and         
 bungalows either side. These houses,  
 many with bay windows, were built of  
 pressed blocks using granite chippings
 to give a rough texture.              
  In the early 1960's in an attempt to 
 clear the slum areas of St Helier a   
 number of high density estates, which 
 included 3 and 5 storey flats, were   
 built.                                </content>
