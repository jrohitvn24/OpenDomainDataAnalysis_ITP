		<title>09Crematorium St.Helens</title>
		<content> The cemetary was opened in 1858 and   
 the {crematorium }was opened in 1962. 
 There is room to expand until the mid 
 1990,s. The {crematorium} is more     
 popular but that has not always been  
 true. Two to three people get buried a
 day on average but seven a day get {  
{cremated} on average. There are three 
 chapels there but only one is now     
 used. They rarely have trouble with   
 vandalism. St.Thomas's Well is        
 supposed to cure blindness. The       
 oldest grave is 1857 20 November, and 
 the person was {Marian Shanks.}The    
 cost to be buried, if you live in     
 St.Helens is Â£59 but if you live      
 outside St.Helens it is Â£118. To {    
{cremate someone,}if you live in       
 St.Helens costs Â£46 but if you live   
 outside St.Helens it costs Â£69. When  
 the {cemetary}first opened to be      
 buried  cost Â£9.                      </content>
