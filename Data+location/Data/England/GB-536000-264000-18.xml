		<title>18NATURE IN LONGSTANTON</title>
		<content>   Amidst such intensive farming it    
 would be odd if we had any unusual    
 flora or fauna. We have no Nature     
 Reserve or Site of Special Scientific 
 Interest, but we do have much we      
 think encouraging.                    
   Bats are back in the High Street.   
 Less spraying means poppies again in  
 the verges. Cowslips have re-appeared:
 we protect two in our school lawn.    
 There are minnows and stone-loach in  
 the brook, and frogs again around our 
 school pond. Kestrels are common. So  
 are newts, if one knows where to look.
 Rabbits again abound in the fields    
 once called Coney Hill. Foxes are a   
 nuisance: one raids the dustbins in   
 Haddows Close. Sadly, Dutch Elm       
 disease is killing all the fine elms  
 in our village, but other trees are   
 already planted and will one day take 
 their place.                          </content>
