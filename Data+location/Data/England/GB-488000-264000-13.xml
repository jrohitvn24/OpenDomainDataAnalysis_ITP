We celebrate the beginning of May by   
having a May Festival. It has been     
celebrated in our village for as long  
as anyone can remember. We do it at    
school. We choose a May Queen and a    
May King by secret ballot of all the   
children. After the Queen has been     
crowned and given an English rose we   
sing our own May Song. The infants then
dance some simple traditional dances.  
It is then the turn of the older       
children who perform dances like The   
Flying Scotsman and the Durham Reel.   
Some of the girls do a clog dance and  
the boys a long sword dance. We end the
first part of the festival with maypole
dancing where we plait the ribbons on  
the maypole. We then parade around the 
arena with garlands we have made and   
then set off around the village in a   
procession headed by the May Queen.    </content>
