		<title>13THE INSTITUTE</title>
		<content>     The institute was once a public   
 house called the Fishermans Arms. It  
  as then turned into a library for    
 fishermen to learn to read. It was    
 completed in 1884, built by Mr Winn &amp; 
 Sons from Helston. Inside the Town    
 Clock is a committee room and two     
 bedrooms. The Clock Tower stands 70ft 
 high and has a weather vane. There are
 four faces on the Clock Tower. Three  
 of the faces are made of copper and   
 are black and gold in colour. The one 
 facing the harbour is made of opal    
 glass and is illuminated by night so  
 fishermen can see the time it is when 
 they go out and come in. The town     
 clock is at the foot of the pier. The 
 numerals on the clock faces are Roman.
