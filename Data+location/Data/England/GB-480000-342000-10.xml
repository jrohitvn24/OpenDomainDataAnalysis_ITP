		<content>{Mr.Dawson}was born in 1905 and has    
 lived in the village all his life. His
 grandfather came to the village in    
 1850 and the family have been builders
 since then.They have been responsible 
 for much of the building work in the  
 surrounding villages within a 15 mile 
 radius. He remembers electricity      
 coming to the village in 1934 and     
 mains water after the 1st World War.  
 The village was dependant on wells    
 and river water before this.          
 In{1985 Long Bennington}is much sought
 after as a residential village,       
 because it has many amenities         
 including ; a new school, a doctor's  
 surgery, shops, garages, hairdresser, 
 hotel, 3 public houses and a village  
 hall. There are also old people's     
 bungalows and warden controlled flats.
 There are plans for future residential
 development south of the school.      </content>
