		<content> Many people will pass by thinking that
 St James's Chapel in Fore Street is   
 the parish church. In truth the latter
 is on the hill to the west of the     
 town, last link with Okehamptons      
 original Saxon site of Ocmundtune. The
 parish church has recently been       
 subject to interior renovation by     
 parishioners. The result shows off    
 well the beautiful roof timbers,      
 granite colonnade and stained glass   
 thus enhancing this active place of   
 worship. The church in Fore St. is    
 also well care for, recently being    
 re-roofed. I suspect tourist have to  
 find the best parts of Okehampton;    
 Simmons Park appears first rather     
 small but opens out to pleasing river 
 side walks. The castle is a little way
 from the town. It could be a rewarding
 place to stop in rather than be       
 stopped in! See By-pass page.         </content>
