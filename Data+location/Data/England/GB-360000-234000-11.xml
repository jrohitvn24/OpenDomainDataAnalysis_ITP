 The churchyard has a 17th C lych-gate 
 (the Skallenge), a fine plague cross  
 restored for Queen Victoria's Golden  
 Jubilee &amp; a 500 year old iron         
 scutcheon plate on the door.    Inside
 is an ancient holy water stoup.   A   
 round Norman arch shows dog tooth     
 moulding on the capital.    The North 
 side is 14th century with barrel roof 
 and some Jacobean panelling.   Three  
 old coffin lids are displayed.   A    
 window shows Lady Godiva &amp; her sister 
 Wulviva who gave the manor of Woolhope
 to Hereford Cathedral in the 11th C.  
 A smaller pane shows Lady Godiva on   
 a white  horse.   The 13th C tower has
 just undergone restoration &amp; houses   
 six bells, one medieval with a prayer 
 to St. John inscribed.   There is a   
 team of bellringers.   The communion  
 plate has been in use for 300 years.  </content>
