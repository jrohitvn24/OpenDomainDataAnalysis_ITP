		<content>    The majority of older houses are   
 stone built: brick was frowned on by  
 local builders. The walls are either  
 rubble with lime mortar infill of     
 coursed stone.                        
    Windows are of three types: Sash,  
 Casement and Yorkshire (sliding       
 horizontally). Roofs are tiled with   
 clay or slate; no thatched houses     
 remain, but one{Cruck House}still     
 does. The clay came originally from a 
 brick works in the village. The slates
 come from Westmoreland or Wales. Apart
 from domestic buildings there is an   
 Anglican church, a Catholic church and
 two Methodist Chapels (one in use).   
 There are now only four food shops, a 
 petrol station, two public houses and 
 several craft workshops. Unusual for  
 the area there are two primary schools
 and two village halls.
