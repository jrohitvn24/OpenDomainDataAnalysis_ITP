		<title>04EDUCATION IN CRICK</title>
		<content>   All children must attend school     
 until they are 16 yrs. This is law. In
 Northamptonshire children start school
 in the September after they are 4.    
 Some pupils stay at school until they 
 are 18 before going on to further     
 training.                             
   In Crick we have a primary school   
 with 96 children between the ages of  
 4-11 yrs.Afterwards they all go to    
 Guilsborough Comprehensive School.    
 They lave Crick by bus at 8.00a.m. and
 return about 4.20p.m.The primary      
 school was built in 1915 but since    
 then it has been added to twice. We   
 have a big hall in which we do P.E.   
 and have our dinners.                 
   A new machine to help in teaching   
 has recently been bought. This is a   
 computer. We have calculators to check
 our work.
