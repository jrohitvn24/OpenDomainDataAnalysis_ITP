 EASTBOURNE LIES AT THE EASTERN END OF 
 THE SOUTH DOWNS. THE BUILT UP AREA IS 
 SITUATED BETWEEN THE SCARP FOOT AND   
 THE MARSHLAND TO THE WEST. MUCH OF THE
 BLOCK IS DOWNLAND WHISH IS USED FOR   
 RECREATION AND AGRICULTURE. THE DOWNS 
 ARE A NATURE CONSERVANCY AREA AS WELL 
 AS AN AREA OF OUTSTANDING BEAUTY.     
 PEOPLE HAVE LIVED ON THE DOWNS SINCE  
 THE STONE AGE BUT THE TOWN DID NOT    
 BECOME PROMINENT UNTIL SEA BATHING    
 BECAME POPULAR IN THE 19TH            
 CENTURY.THOUGH MODERN HOUSING ESTATES 
 HAVE BEEN BUILT MANY OLD BUILDINGS    
 HAVE BEEN CONVERTED INTO FLATS. THERE 
 IS A LOT OF OPEN PARKLAND AND         
 ALLOTMENT AREA FOR THE PUBLIC TO USE. 
 GOLF AND WALKING ARE PERHAPS THE MOST 
 POPULAR RECREATIONS ON THE DOWNS.
