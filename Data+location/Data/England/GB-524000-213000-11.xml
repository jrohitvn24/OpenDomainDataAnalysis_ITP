		<title>11FAMILY SUNDAYS</title>
		<content> Mummy usually wakes me up about 8.30. 
 We have breakfast and there's a normal
 rush to get ready for Sunday School.  
 When that is finished we go into the  
 Church Service.  After we come home I 
 read.  We have lunch about 1pm.  It is
 usually meat, potatoes, gravy and     
 vegetables, followed by ice-cream and 
 chocolate sauce. In the afternoon we  
 go for a walk.  After tea we go to    
 Church again.  Then we go to bed.{

 I wake about 7.30 and I read.  Later I
 listen quietly to some records.  About
 9 am Dad gets up and makes Mum's      
 breakfast of tea and toast then ours  
 of bacon and eggs.  In summer time, we
 pick fruit - strawberries and         
 raspberries, but hardly ever          
 gooseberries. After lunch I watch     
 Grandstand then Dad and I play        
 cricket.{Tom Clayton(9)}              </content>
