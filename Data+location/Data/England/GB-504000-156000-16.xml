		<title>16LOCAL HISTORY.</title>
		<content> The history of these villages is a    
 matter of pride. Wisley was an Iron   
 Age settlement, perhaps older, and    
 Pyrford has visible traces of that    
 time. Both have unrestored Norman     
 churches-Pyrford's just outside this  
 block. There are fine listed buildings
 and conservation areas, particularly  
 in Ripley and Ockham. The boundaries  
 of Pyrford were outlined in 956 AD.   
 Ripley, too, has Norman origins. Its  
 66 acres green, the largest in the    
 country escaped enclosure. After the  
 stage coach era it became a famous    
 venue for cycling clubs. Nearby the   
 ruins of Newark Priory, 1199, occupy  
 the one dry part of the water meadows.
 Wisley's Decoy was a game bird pool on
 the Pyrford Place estate, once a rival
 to Clandon. Ockham, rebuilt by the    
 Lovelace's in the C19, was run as a   
 feudal estate until sold in 1955.     </content>
