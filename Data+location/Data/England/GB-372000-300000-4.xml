		<content>{Crops. } We saw a field where a sugar 
 beet demonstration had been held.     
 The sugar beet is harvested and taken 
 by lorry to  Kidderminster            
 factory from  about October  till     
 February.Farmers are issued with      
 permits which allow them to send a    
 limited amount of beet to the factory 
 each day.  They can buy back sugar    
 beet pulp, which they use for animal  
 fodder.                               
   Potatoes are harvested in summer and
 autumn, most of them being sold       
 directly to potato merchants.  Extra  
 local labour is used on the machines  
 for planting and harvesting .         
   Some fodder beet is grown for       
 feeding to animals in the winter.
