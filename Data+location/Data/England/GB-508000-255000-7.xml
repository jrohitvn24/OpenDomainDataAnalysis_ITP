		<title>07UNUSUAL FEATURES IN WILDEN.</title>
		<content> At the East End of Wilden village lies
 a large {reservoir,}constructed by one
 of the farmers after the 1976 drought.
 Strictly private but tempting to      
 young swimmers.                       
 Coming towards the village one passes 
 the {Boarding Kennels}- not a popular 
 place with local residents in summer  
 time.                                 
 On the hill towards Colmworth is a {  
{Cattery,}somewhat quieter than the    
 kennels. Tucked out of sight in the   
 Barford Road is the {Baptist Chapel.  
  A pack of{Beagle Hounds }is kept at  
 the opposite end of the village       
 -almost unnoticed.                    
{Horse riding}is a popular pastime,    
 with many families owning their own   
 horses.                               
 A {Post Office }was housed at the back
 of the local pub, but sadly it closed 
 last month.                           </content>
