		<content>  My name is Alexandra Jarvis, I am 9. 
l live in Lingley Drive, Wainscott.    
This is a record of a day in my life on
Saturday 11th May 1985.                
  I woke up at 8.30 am and switched on 
my light at 8.34.  I read a chapter of 
a book called Â£The Folk of the Faraway 
Tree'.It is about 3 children called Jo,
Bessie and Fanny and their cousin      
Connie who has come to stay with them  
but she does not believe in the people 
who live there like Moonface,Silky and 
Saucepan who is a bit deaf.  Then l    
drank a cup of tea , my mum used P.G   
Tips.  At 8.45 l finished my tea and   
digestive biscuit.  I finished the     
chapter of my book I was reading and   
got up.                                
  At 9.00 l got dressed. l put on my   
jeans and my Popeye sweater and washed 
my face and hands.  l used Pears soap, 
then l went downstairs brushed my hair.</content>
