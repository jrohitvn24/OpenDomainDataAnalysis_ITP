		<title>07MAB'S CROSS</title>
		<content>  Our school is called{Mab's Cross}and 
 it got its name from Lady Mabel       
 Bradshaigh who lived at{Haigh Hall.   
 Lady Mabel's husband had to go fight  
 in a crusade. After ten years he had  
 not come back so Lady Mabel married   
 again, this time to Welsh knight. Her 
 first husband returned and found out. 
 He killed the knight and as a severe  
 punishment for his wife he made her   
 walk barefoot all the way from Haigh  
 Hall past the area where our school is
 now to a{stone cross}and back to Haigh
 Hall, about four miles in all.        
                                       
  Today Haigh Hall has been made into  
 a{country park}and some{nature trails 
 and Mab's Cross is situated right in  
 front of our school.
