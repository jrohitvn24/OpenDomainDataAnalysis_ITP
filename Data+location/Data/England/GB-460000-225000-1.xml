		<content> The block mainly contains the village 
 &amp; farms of the parish of Stratton     
 Audley. Stratton Audley is basically  
 an agricultural community, although   
 recent developments in the village    
 have also created a dormitory for     
 surrounding towns. The farms of       
 Stratton Audley Hall, The Willows,    
 Pool Farm &amp; Manor Farm are mainly     
 arable (cereal crops). Elm Farm, West 
 Farm &amp; Oldfields Farm are mixed, with 
 dairy &amp; fatstock herds, some sheep &amp;  
 some cereal crops. The kennels to the 
 south of the village are the home of  
 the Bicester &amp; Warden Hill Hunt. The  
 residential developments, Cavendish   
 Place, The Limes &amp; the Manor, contain 
 properties in the higher price bracket
 so most of the owners are company     
 managers, executives etc, working in  
 Buckingham, Bicester, Oxford, Banbury 
 and Aylesbury.                        </content>
