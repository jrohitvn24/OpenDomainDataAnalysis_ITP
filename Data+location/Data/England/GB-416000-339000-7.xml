		<title>07BULK MILK COLLECTION</title>
		<content>    The Bulk Milk Collection Company is
 about 52 years old. It was formed in  
 1933.                                 
    The milk is collected from the     
 dairy farms. The milk tankers go to   
 collect it.  When it is collected it  
 goes to five different dairies. They  
 are at Alfreton, Burton, Nottingham,  
 Hartington and Nestles in Ashbourne.  
    At the depot there are 25 milk     
 tankers and 41 people work there      
 altogether. Every tanker holds  9092  
 litres of milk. The depot is in       
 Ashbourne. The manager organises the  
 routes and makes sure everyone does   
 their job. He lives in Yeaveley.      
    The milk tankers go to about 26    
 different farms each, every day of the
 year, even Christmas Day.
