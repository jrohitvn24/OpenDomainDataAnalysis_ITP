		<content>                                       
 In July 1985 the eighteen century     
 windmill in Tiptree was up for sale   
 for Â£75,000.It is a grade two listed  
 building.The 60 foot high mill was    
 threatened by demolition in the       
 1960's.A fight to stop the mill being 
 demolished,even though it was badly   
 decayed was waged.                    
 The case for restoring the mill was   
 put before top_ranking government     
 officials and eventually the go_ahead 
 was given.                            
 Subsequent owners have restored it and
 it is now a residence consisting of   
 nine rooms,including two bathrooms,an 
 attic room right at the top and is set
 in a garden of a third of an acre.
