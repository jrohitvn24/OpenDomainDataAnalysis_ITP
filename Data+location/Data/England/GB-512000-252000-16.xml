		<title>16Roxton Trout Lake</title>
		<content> We went along a dirt track which was  
 marked as gravel pits on the map.These
 had been transformed into a beautiful 
 trout lake.Two thousand,five hundred  
 fish are stocked in the lake          
 throughout the year.The oldest fish   
 found in the lake was five years old. 
 It weighed 5lb.6oz.There is a fishing 
 club with fifty members which is owned
 by Mr.Bath(Senior)and his son Mr.Simon
 Bath.Members are allowed to catch four
 fish a day and eight per week.The     
 lakes have received an award for land 
 conservation.                         
 There were beautiful bushes and trees 
 planted everywhere and sheep were     
 grazing on the surrounding grass.
