		<title>04Roehampton (1) The Village</title>
		<content>Roehampton was once a village on the   
southwest outskirts of London, on the  
London to Portsmouth Road.In Roehampton
today there are areas of different     
housing distinctly marked off from each
other and each neighbourhood has its   
shops and Primary school.There is no   
Secondary school.Roehampton Community  
Council organises such activities as a 
People's Festival in June, a holiday   
project and a community newspaper.     
A large area, north of the village, was
developed by a private company in the  
1920's and much of it is very expensive
housing.The 'village' is a Conservation
Area and contains many attractive old  
buildings including the King's Head pub
and the Montague Arms, and the country 
cottages in Medfield Street.People like
living in Roehampton even though there 
are not many opportunities for employ- 
ment or leisure. (continued over)      </content>
