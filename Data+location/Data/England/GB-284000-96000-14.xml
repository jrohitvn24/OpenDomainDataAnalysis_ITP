		<title>14TRAFFIC COUNT NEWTON ST. C.</title>
		<content>   Our count,on Friday May 24 between  
 8.30a.m. and 3.30p.m.,showed that{4350
{vehicles}passed through our village.  
{  Over 3000 cars and about 1000 heavy 
{lorries and vans}were recorded.50     
 buses/coaches and 50 motorcycles were 
 listed.Only{two cycles}were noted.    
  {An average of more than 600 vehicles
{per hour}travelled on the A377 Main   
 road in that period.                  
   The highest number of cars recorded 
 was between 8.30 and 9.30a.m. in the  
 Exeter direction.We assume that most  
 of the drivers and passengers were    
{travelling to work in or around the   
{city.                                 
   The number of cyclists shows,       
 perhaps, how dangerous this road is.  
  {Many 'near-misses' are not recorded 
 in Devon County Council's official    
{accident figures.                     
                                       </content>
