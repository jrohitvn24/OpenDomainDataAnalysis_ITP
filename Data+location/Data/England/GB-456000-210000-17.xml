		<title>17CHURCHES OF BECKLEY &amp; HORTON</title>
		<content>St.Barnabas Church, Horton, was built  
in 1867 by William Butterfield in a    
similar brick to his Keble College.    
St.Mary's, Beckley, is basically a     
Norman church rebuilt in the 14th.     
Century. At Beckley the bells are      
unsafe and cannot be rung although     
early wall paintings have recently     
been restored. In 1985 a rare Church   
Court was held when two villagers      
objected to the placing of a central   
altar. The Vicar, the Rev.A.de Vere,   
celebrates Eucharist in both churches  
each Sunday. Both churchyards are still
open for burials although most people  
are now cremated. Our survey showed    
that 18.5% attended a place of worship 
regularly, 5.5% quite often, 31%       
occasionally, 22% seldom and 22% never.
