		<content> I am Vicki Bliss and I am 9 years     
 old.                                  
 I am 1.34m and weigh 26kg. I have dark
 blue eyes and light complexion.I wear 
 glasses for school work. I like       
 wearing skirts and dresses. My hobbies
 are horse riding, swimming, playing   
 tennis and cricket and also writing. I
 am a little bit messy at home and I   
 don't like to be told off - but I do  
 like work. I get upset very easily but
 I do argue a bit. I like school a lot.
 At home I usually play outside the    
 front of our house in South Street on 
 my rollerboots or sometimes in my     
 backyard. If it is raining I play     
 indoors in my bedroom with my toy     
 Little Ponies. I go to Brownies and   
 like it a lot. I am not a shy person  
 and I like going on the stage.
