		<title>07The Naked Man : an old oak.</title>
		<content>                                       
  The Naked Man is the site of a very  
 old oak.Only a rather sad looking     
 old stump about 3 or 4m high remains  
 today.Local history tends to suggest  
 that is about 400 hundred years old.  
     The remains can be found in a map 
 reference{246018}in this area.The     
 origin of the name remains open to    
 question a local legend.One story     
 tells that a highwayman named {Mark   
{Way}was hanged on the tree,and there  
 was a hill near by called{Mark Way    
{Hill,}close to the{A305}.Another story
 based on Kings map of 1759 does not   
 support the gibbet story,but thinks it
 is a pun on{Mark Way,}the old         
 Southampton - Dorset road.While the   
 latter story may be more likely,the   
 romance of the highwayman has more    
 support in many peoples' eyes.
