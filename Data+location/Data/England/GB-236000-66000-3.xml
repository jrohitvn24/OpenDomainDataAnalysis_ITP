		<title>03Crocadon Farm Crops</title>
		<content>    Mr.Bush's farm is split into two   
 parts. One half is based at Crocadon  
 whilst the remainder is located at    
 Viverdon Down one mile away.          
    Half the acreage is in permanent   
 pasture. On the rest is grown 90 acres
 of{barley,}5 acres of{potatoes}and 3  
 acres of{maize.}The latter is harvest-
 ed unripened by forage harvester and  
 used for high grade silage. About 40  
 acres of intensively grown grass is   
 also cropped for silage. An           
 agricultural contractor is hired for  
 all harvest operations.The{silage}crop
 is taken by trailer to the old mill   
 pond which has been converted into a  
 silage pit.There the crop is preserved
 by sealing down with black plastic    
 sheeting until required for winter    
 feed. Some of the{barley}corn is also 
 kept for animal feed but the bulk is  
 sold to corn merchants.               </content>
