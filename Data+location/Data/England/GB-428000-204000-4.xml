 the girls and kiss them.Older children
 prefer{countdown,bulldog and tig},all 
 variants of chasing and tigging by    
 touching. Those who are tigged then   
 become the pursuers.{Hide &amp; seek}and  
{50_50 In}are similar. In the latter 4 
 posts are named ,the seeker counts to 
 50 while the others try to touch the  
 posts unobserved. They must hide when
