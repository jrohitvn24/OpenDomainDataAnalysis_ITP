		<title>02CLYST VALLEY:AGRICULTURE.</title>
		<content> The agricultural land of this area is 
 rich and fertile. The soil varies from
 sand to clay very sharply.As the      
 valley is very flat and low lying,land
 near the river is liable to flood in  
 the winter and remains wet even in    
 summertime.These parts are left       
 as permanent grassland of an          
 indifferent quality and are used for  
 grazing so long as the land remains   
 firm enough to support the weight of  
 cattle.                               
  The arable land is used mainly to    
 grow fodder crops                     
 e.g.wheat,barley,maize,peas and beans.
 to feed the dairy herds.Some cash     
 crops such as potatoes are grown but  
 this is relatively unimportant.       
  The area also has several nursery    
 gardens and smallholdings.
