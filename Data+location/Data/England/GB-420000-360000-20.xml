		<title>20Birchover Village Fair</title>
		<content>  A Village Fair is held each Summer   
 but in June 1984 it was combined with 
 the School Centenary.                 
  The Playgroup, Church, Chapels and   
 W.I set up stalls in the school play- 
 ground and sold handicrafts, plants,  
 cakes and jumble whilst refreshments  
 were available in the Reading Room.   
  In Church was a Flower Festival with 
 the organist playing appropriate music
  Meanwhile the Centenary Exhibition in
 school provided great interest as past
 pupils reminisced over old photographs
 The school kitchen, too, was trans-   
 formed into a Victorian kitchen with  
 local people lending furnishings and  
 equipment.                            
  Maypole dancing by the children added
 a final delightful touch to the event.
                                       
 Written by pupils, staff and friends  
 of Birchover Infants  School.         </content>
