 On a school day I get up at 7o'clock. 
 I get dressed after I have brushed my 
 teeth and washed.Then I go downstairs 
 for breakfast. Sometimes I have bacon 
 and egg for breakfast .Sometimes I    
 have 'eggy bread' which is bread      
 dipped in egg and fried.I finish      
 breakfast by 8 o'clock .Then I do a   
 job - like sweeping or something. I   
 walk to the bus stop. I travel four   
 miles to school. I get there at 8.40. 
 I follow a normal school day with     
 four lessons. I stay for school meals.
 School finishes at 3.30pm and my bus  
 comes at 4.00pm. I get back in the    
 house at 4.30pm. I have tea - man be  
 quiche or baked bean pie. Then I go   
 out to play with a friend until       
 7.30pm. Then I have supper and watch  
 television. I go to bed at 9 O'clock.
