		<content> The Land Settlement Association (LSA) 
 was formed by two charities  (Plunkett
 Foundation and Carnegie Trust) in 1935
 to provide work for out_of_work miners
 during the 1930's depression. In      
 1950's it fell into financial         
 difficulties and was taken over by the
 Ministry of Agriculture Fishery's and 
 Food.  It was restructured to provide 
 opportunities for horticultural and   
 agricultural workers to set up their  
 own businesses. The Foxash Estate in  
 Lawford was one of ten, and comprised 
 of sixty smallholdings which belonged 
 to MAFF. The tenants owned their own  
 glasshouses and sent their produce to 
 a central packhouse for LSA marketing.
 LSA 1983 was set up to give growers a 
 chance to form their own businesses   
 because of the LSA closure in 1982.
