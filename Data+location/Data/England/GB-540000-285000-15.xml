		<title>15Chatteris - A Day's Work</title>
		<content> My Dad is a mechanic.  He doesn't work
 for anyone because he's got his own   
 workshop and tools.  When he gets up  
 he dresses, makes tea and has         
 breakfast.  Then he puts on his       
 overalls and goes to his workshop.  He
 does re-spraying, welding, bodywork,  
 servicing and restoration work.       
 Restoration is when an old car has    
 been left and not used for years so   
 that it's rusty and the engine has    
 seized up.  My Dad has to restore it  
 and make it work so that it can be    
 licenced again.                       
                                       
 He doesn't work the same number of    
 hours every day because he goes       
 bowling quite a lot.  He comes in from
 work about 8.30 to 9.00 unless he's   
 been bowling or he's behind in his    
 work.                                 
                                       </content>
