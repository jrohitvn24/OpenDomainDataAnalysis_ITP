		<title>07Horningtoft Sign</title>
		<content> Horningtoft Sign was designed by Dave 
 Stevens and carved by Maurice Reeder  
 and erected in 1980. The sign now     
 stands on private ground by the       
 permission of Mr and Miss Crow on     
 the North West side of the church. The
 base of the sign is made of stone and 
 concrete which some people put things 
 in so that if the sign were ever dug  
 up others would find them.            
                                       
 There's a rose carved on the stem of  
 the sign that is there for the reason 
 that there used to be a rent house and
 if you ever lived in it the payment   
 was a rose paid to the vicar on       
 Midsummer's day.Also carved on the    
 sign is a pair of silver scales found 
 in 1870 and an old Norfolk Plough     
 which unearthed a Roman urn.
