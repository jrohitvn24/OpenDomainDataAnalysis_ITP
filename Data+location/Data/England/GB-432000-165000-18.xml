		<content> In this area there are not many       
 houses, with the exception of the     
 North West corner which accounts for  
 well over 55O,on roads leading out of 
 the town built mostly in the last 4O  
 years.                                
 About 4O% are privately owned - most  
 built in the last 15/2O years.  Around
 the countryside there have been some  
 good conversions and restoration of   
 old farmhouses and cottages.          
 Around 6O% have been built by the     
 District Council including flats and  
 bungalows.  It is now possible to     
 purchase some houses and about 17% of 
 tenants are now house owners.         
 There are small portions of land let  
 out for cultivation.In the North West 
 area there is about an acre divided   
 into sixteen plots used by people for 
 growing vegetables, very popular now  
 that most homes have freezers.        </content>
