		<content> There are all kinds of vehicles cars  
 vans tractors and wagons. The cars can
 go up to about 110 m.p.h there were   
 tractors and different types of       
 machinery like trailers and crop      
 sprayers .In Dacre there is a post    
 office with a post box and a public   
 phone to go with it.There is a        
 silo                                  
 tower on one of the farms for silage. 
 Electric fences are used for stopping 
 cows getting out of fields.We often   
 get low flying aircraft Royal Air     
 Force planes.On a smaller scale we    
 have welders and other electric tools.
 Electricity is used in our houses for 
 tv.,radio,cooking,washing,refrigerato 
 rs ,cleaners and we have telephones   
 some people have microwave            
 ovens.Science and technoligy has      
 effected farming in the area resulting
 in less people employed on the land.  </content>
