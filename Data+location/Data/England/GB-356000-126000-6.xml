		<title>06FARMING</title>
		<content>    There are eleven farms in our area,
 most of them being dairy,however      
 because of the milk surplus, some have
 moved out of dairy to mainly arable.  
    Most of the bigger farms of a 1000 
 acres are tenanted and these generally
 are arable, and if the crops can be   
 combined,only four or five men are    
 needed to run the farm, as the use of 
 computers helps a great deal.         
    Manor Farm,which is in Babcary,is  
 a pig farm and has recently moved out 
 from dairy.                           
    Many of the orchards (which used   
 to produce apples) in this area have  
 now been turned into grazing land as  
 they were not producing fruit         
 economically.                         
    The main crops in this area are    
 winter wheat, winter barley, oil seed 
 rape.
