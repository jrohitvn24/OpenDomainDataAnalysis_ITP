		<content> We recently went in a small group to  
 talk to Mrs Hinett who is the oldest  
 resident in Brereton.She has lived    
 here for 89years and went to the      
 school at the age of 5 and left at the
 age of 14.The school then had 4 class-
 rooms and 4 teachers,the Headmaster,  
 his wife,his daughter and an outside  
 teacher from Sandbach.There was no    
 playground as such,the children were  
 able to use the School-house garden   
 and also the road alongside as there  
 was very little traffic.              
  All written work was done on slates  
 with either a slate pencil or with    
 chalk.They had quite a few textbooks  
 but not as many as we have nowadays.  
 The children came to school from quite
 a wide area including theWorkhouse at 
 Arclid.Of course there were no buses  
 then to transport the children.
