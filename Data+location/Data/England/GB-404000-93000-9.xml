		<content>    At the Day Centre three people     
 volunteer to keep the Centre clean and
 to help the old people. Also they have
 a number of people making tea and     
 coffee. A lady is in overall charge of
 the centre. There are about 90 elderly
 people who regularly attend the       
 centre.                               
    They have an ambulance which is    
 provided by the D.H.S.S. to collect   
 them and to take them home. A hot meal
 is provided by the Residential Home   
 which costs them 83p a day.           
   There is a hairdressing service     
 available, once a week, which they    
 have to pay for, run by a lady who    
 owns her own hairdressing shop.       
    In their spare time they make      
 trays, baskets, coathanger covers, pot
 plant holders, bed socks, hats, window
 cloths, blankets and rugs which they  
 later sell to visitors.               </content>
