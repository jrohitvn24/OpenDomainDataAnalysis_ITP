		<content> People have convenience foods because 
 it is quick and easy. If you had a    
 steak it would take about two hours to
 prepare but with sausages or          
 fishfingers it is easier and quicker  
 to do and saves on power. With a      
 microwave it is even quicker and      
 cleaner.People do not always want     
 convenience foods when they have a    
 barbecue people cook sausages, steaks 
 etc. in the old fashioned way, because
 it is  good fun and tasty when done in
 the right way.Some food is junk food  
 it makes you fat and not healthy.     
 People buy fish and chips from        
 chipshops they also buy curry from  a 
 chinese takeaway. There are take away 
 fried chicken shops and baked         
 potato shops. Not many go short of    
 food compared with people in          
 Africa.
