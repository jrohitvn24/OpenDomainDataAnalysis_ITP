		<content> There is a wide range of flora        
 especially on the roadside and in the 
 few remaining hedges. Many of the     
 field hedges have been removed but    
 some of the roadside ones are very    
 old. Early in the year snowdrops pink 
 and yellow primroses followed by      
 cowslips are to be found near the     
 hedges. In May the roadsides are white
 with cow parsley, and as the crops    
 ripen there are poppies. Hidden away  
 in odd corners are some protected     
 species. This area has been badly hit 
 by dutch elm disease, where whold     
 stands of trees have had to be        
 removed. These are being replaced by  
 new trees of a different species.     
 Where a farmer has an odd shape piece 
 of land he will often plant it with   
 trees. There are several woods in our 
 block, mostly deciduous, mostly oak,  
 chestnut and a few beech.             </content>
