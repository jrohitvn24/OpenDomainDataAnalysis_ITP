		<title>19CHEDDAR RESERVOIR</title>
		<content>{Cheddar Reservoir}is situated between 
{Axbridge and Cheddar.}It was built in 
 1922 by the Council. Some of the water
 comes from rain but the rest comes    
 down from springs in the Gorge. The   
 water is pumped to treatment works at 
 Cheddar. The water then goes off to   
 places such as{Cheddar, Cross, Brent  
{Knoll, Burnham-on-Sea, and Highbridge.
 Raw water is pumped from a well where 
 it is treated and then sent to Weston.
 Some water goes to{Barrow tanks}where 
 again it is treated and moved away to 
 Bristol.                              
{Cheddar reservoir}holds 6,137,000     
 litres. People{sail}on the reservoir  
 for pleasure and sometimes people     
 go windsurfing. I like watching them  
 falling off when I walk around the    
 reservoir. You can also go fishing    
 in the reservoir. The{fishermen}often 
 catch pike.                           </content>
