		<title>16Re-thatching Cottages</title>
		<content> This year the two cottages adjacent to
 the Jackal public house in Thurleigh  
 were rethatched. They are small       
 cottages, but each roof took six weeks
 to complete and cost Â£5,000. The      
 thatcher starts at the eaves laying   
 the straw bundles side by side. As    
 each bundle is secured on to the layer
 of old thatch it is secured by a hazel
 spar. They are then trimmed flat with 
 shears. Each roof takes 2,000 spars,  
 all of which are bent and twisted into
 shape by hand. The last stage is the  
 ridge pattern, which is the hallmark  
 of the master thatcher. On completion 
 the roof is covered with netting to   
 keep out birds and rodents. This is   
 now made of plastic rather than wire  
 netting. The roof can be expected to  
 last some 30 to 40 years.
