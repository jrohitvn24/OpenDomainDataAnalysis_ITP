		<title>14RELIGION IN MORETON</title>
		<content> There are four{places of worship}in   
 Moreton. St. David's, the Anglican    
 Church, St. George's, the Roman       
 Catholic Church, the Congregational   
 Church and the Fosseway Evangelical   
 Gospel Hall(generally known as Open   
 Brethren). The Congregational and     
 Anglican{churches}are both made of    
 Cotswold stone. The Congregational    
 Church was built in 1895 and St.      
 David's in 1861. The Gospel Hall is a 
 wooden building built in 1948. St.    
 George's is built of reconstituted    
 stone and was erected in 1956 (mainly 
 with U.S.A.F. money).                 
   The Anglican Clergyman also looks   
 after the Parish churches of Todenham,
 Lower Lemington and Batsford. The     
 Catholic Priest comes to Moreton from 
 Chipping Campden. The Gospel Hall has 
 no{minister,}but there are 6 elders   
 (all men, women can't take services). </content>
