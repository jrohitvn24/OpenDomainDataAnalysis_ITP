There is quite a lot for entertainment 
about Chesterton.   There are pubs     
which are used by people over eighteen 
as a place to meet with friends and    
have a drink, usually alcoholic.       
Clubs are just a bigger version of     
pubs with more room and children are   
allowed in.   For children there is a  
youth club and disco which has a games 
room.   These places are usually open  
at night and so is a bingo hall where  
people go to waste a small amount of   
money hoping to win more by ticking the
numbers off on a ticket.   In the day  
there is a swimming pool and sports    
hall belonging to the High School.     
Every summer there is an annual        
carnival which starts with a parade, a 
troupe display and the local Boys      
Brigade Band.  Floats are decorated    
with flowers and streamers.            </content>
