		<title>09SEA VIEW</title>
		<content> Sea View is a small settlement of 8   
 terraced houses situated at the       
 highest point of our area.They were   
 probably built in the early 1900's ,to
 house workers in the China Clay       
 industry and certainly before the age 
 of the car as there are galvanised    
 iron garages more recently built .    
   Six of the houses are rendered with 
 mortar ,two unusually for Cornwall are
 built of red brick.The roofs are made 
 of slate .Two still have water taps   
 outside ,it was most probably called  
 Sea View because you can see the sea  
 from this high point .At the front of 
 the houses are small gardens ,not very
 well maintained .Small iron gates     
 provide entrance to properties .Some  
 windows were broken .The overall      
 impression was one of an isolated     
 settlement in need of some care and   
 attention .                           </content>
