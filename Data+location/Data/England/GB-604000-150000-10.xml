		<title>10GODMERSHAM HOUSING</title>
		<content> Much of the housing belonged to the   
 large estate of Godmersham Park. Most 
 of these have been sold to private    
 owners over the years with only 4     
 cottages still being occupied by      
 estate workers and two by retired     
 staff.Only two houses have been built 
 during the past decade but several    
 buildings have been converted for     
 residential use recently, including   
 our vllage shop and the old village   
 school which had become a field study 
 centre. An oast and large barn have   
 been converted in to 4 dwellings at   
 East Stour Farm and a new house is    
 being built of old materials in       
 Eggarton Lane. We have 8 council      
 houses representing only 4% of the    
 housing and the council is aware of   
 the need for more housing for the     
 elderly in the area.
