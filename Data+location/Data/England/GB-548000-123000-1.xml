 Our School. The school was built of   
 sandstone in 1874 with tall windows   
 like a church so that the children    
 could not look out. We have a large   
 playing field and a small tarmac      
 playground.There is a concrete canteen
 that serves as a hall and a newish    
 prefabricated classroom.
