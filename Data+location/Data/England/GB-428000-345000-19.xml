    The name 'Cowers Lane'  goes  back 
 900 years in that it  was  where  the 
 'great Cowhouse' was for  the Hundred 
 of Appletree.                         
                                       
    No-one seems to be quite sure where
 the name  'Cross  o' th' Hands'  comes
 from;  maybe  it  was a cross that was
 used as a signpost.                   
                                       
                                       
    Windley and Turnditch as names both
 seem to originate in  medieval  times.
                                       
    Shottle  is  almost   certainly  of
 Saxon origin , Shottlegate  being  the
 entrance  to  Shottle  Park  in Norman
 times.
