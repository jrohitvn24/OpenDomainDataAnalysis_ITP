		<content>   The villagers were mostly born and  
 bred in the village and their families
 have lived there many years. Most of  
 them find employment as domestic staff
 at Stonyhurst College. Their lives are
 centred in the village-the pub,the    
 football club and the golf club.      
   Many of the Stonyhurst teachers live
 in Stonyhurst property.They spend most
 of their social life with the other   
 teachers.The men play sports together.
 They meet up at College functions.Most
 teachers leave the village during the 
 holidays.                             
   Some commuters live in the area.Some
 commute as far as Manchester.         
   The life styles of the priest and   
 the public schoolboy are very         
 different from others (see EDUCATION  
 for the public schoolboy).
