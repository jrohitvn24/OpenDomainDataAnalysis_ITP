		<title>12Places of Worship-Merebrow.</title>
		<content> In the block there are two places of  
 worship both Methodist Chapels.       
   Merebrow Chapel was built in 1902 of
 red brick and blue slates. It is quite
 a small chapel as Merebrow is a small 
 village. Inside the chapel there are  
 three rows of seats-two sides and the 
 middle. Each seat is about 3 metres   
 long in the middle and 2 metres at the
 sides. At the front of the chapel     
 there is the pulpit where the preacher
 preaches. Behind the front of the     
 chapel is a Vestry where the preacher 
 and the organist wait for the service 
 to begin. Half way through the service
 the children come out of the chapel   
 and go into Sunday School for half an 
 hour, then we go home.                
   There is a service in the afternoon 
 also but no Sunday School.
