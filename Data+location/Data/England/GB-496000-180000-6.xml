		<title>06A PERSONAL VIEW OF SLOUGH</title>
		<content>    Slough today, to an outsider, would
 be the perfect place to live;{near    
{London, good communications, lots of  
{jobs, a shopping centre, plenty of    
{schools}and on the whole good{activity
{centres. }The reality is rather       
 different.                            
   {Vandalism}is apparent (just as in  
 other towns) throughout Slough and it 
 is not uncommon for the council to    
 repair a telephone kiosk, only to     
 return the next day to replace the    
 glass, because somebody's smashed it  
 again.  It seems they are fighting a  
 losing battle.                        
    Another one of Slough's pitfalls   
 is the fact that{women and girls}are  
 unable to walk the streets after dark 
 without worrying about who's around   
 the next corner.  Almost every week   
 the paper reads{GIRL ATTACKED}and even
{MAN KNIFED.                           </content>
