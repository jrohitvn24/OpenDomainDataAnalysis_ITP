		<content>  There are no ethnic minorities in the
 village and the language used is      
 English.There are three residents who 
 were German born but are now British  
 citizens. There is still a strong     
 feeling for dialect amongst the older 
 citizens, but the younger generation  
 only use it in sketches and in fun.   
 Some words have a Scandinavian origin 
 as in dwyle (a floor cloth)"That" is  
 used in place of "it" as in "Thats a  
 fine day" and double negatives are    
 common, a practical person being      
 described as "not an unhandy man"
