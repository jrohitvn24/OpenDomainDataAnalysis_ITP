		<title>18ARCHAEOLOGY IN LECHLADE</title>
		<content>{FINANCE.}In April 1985 archaeologists 
 fom Oxford University came to Lechlade
 to excavate in Butlers Field. They ran
 out of financial backing but          
 fortunately extra grants were made so 
 that the excavations could be         
 completed.{GENERAL INFORMATION.}The   
 archaeologists have known about the   
 site since 1940. Photographs taken    
 from the air showed where the crops   
 were darker, usually  big patches or  
 dots close together. The dig was for a
{Neolithic Barrow}but an{Anglo Saxon   
{Cemetery}was also found. So far over  
 240 graves have been found. This site 
 is believed to be the largest of its  
 kind found in England. The Site       
 Director is Dr. David Miles. There has
 been great interest shown by the local
 community and Dr. Miles has given two 
 talks in the Memorial Hall. The       
 Primary School has made a video film. </content>
