		<title>20A Visit to Trimley St.Mary</title>
		<content>   {Trimley St. Mary Primary school}was
 built in{1904}and is now being        
 rebuilt.Mr.Dixon, the headmaster told 
 us that the rebuilding is affecting   
 everybody because they keep having to 
 move to different parts of the        
 school.The construction work will     
 result in a modern school but they    
 will all be glad when it's finished.  
{Mr.Dixon}hopes the school will be     
 ready by mid-summer.The school will be
 much bigger than{Grange}because it    
 holds 400 pupils.It has a better      
 swimming pool which is heated and has 
 changing rooms.The hall is larger with
 a large wooden floor. The infant      
 department is designed with an art    
 area and a bay with classrooms leading
 off.During the rebuilding the pupils  
 have learned much about construction.
