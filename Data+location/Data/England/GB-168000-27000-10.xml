		<content> Children who stayed for lunch warmed  
 pasties on the stoves, others walked  
 home. The desks had bench seats for   
 two with holes for inkwells. The      
 children wrote in exercise books,     
 seldom  painted but did some detailed 
 drawing.There were maps on the walls. 
 The teacher had a cane which she used 
 often. Playground games included      
 marbles,spinning tops,tig,leapfrog and
 rolling hoops:metal for the boys and  
 wooden for the girls. They  made      
 popguns with ramrods which fired      
 pellets, and whistles made from       
 sycamore.
