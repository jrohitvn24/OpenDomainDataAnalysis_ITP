		<content>    This area of gently rolling        
 countryside lies partly in Essex and  
 partly in Cambridgeshire.  It is      
 nearly all arable farmland, with some 
 woodland, and the village of Hadstock 
 at its eastern edge.                  
    Only a few hundred people live     
 within the entire area, and there is  
 only one through road, from Saffron   
 Walden to Linton, running through     
 Hadstock.  Another lane runs into the 
 western edge of the area from Great   
 Chesterford.                          
    Part of the area is an old         
 aerodrome, now mostly farmland again. 
 A line of electricity power lines     
 crosses the area from north to south. 
    In some places, woodland or rough  
 common land has been converted to     
 ploughland, and hedges have been dug  
 up to make the use of farm machinery  
 more convenient.                      </content>
