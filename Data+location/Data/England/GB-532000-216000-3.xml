The firm's annual sales are around one 
million pounds. Control panels have    
been designed and made for many        
industries including the British Steel 
Corporation, water authorities, oil    
companies and breweries. One order that
was nearly completed was to operate the
freezers at a Sainsbury's new store.   
The company likes to take on school    
leavers of sixteen and train them by   
sending them on day release to college.
Some trainees are on the YTS scheme.   
The salaries offered are good. The     
business is expanding and at the moment
there are 30 employees: ten working in 
the drawing office and twenty in the   
workshop.Each person is assigned to    
order and sees it through.             
Competition is fierce but the company  
has a name for producing quality goods 
at competitive prices.                 </content>
