		<content>       Five round towers line the coast
 from La Rocque to Grouville Common.   
 They were built to defend Jersey from 
 French attack in the late eighteenth  
 and nineteenth centuries.  These      
 towers, which were constructed as a   
 consequence of the French invasion    
 that led to the Battle of Jersey in   
 1781, are not 'Martello' Towers in the
 proper sense, since true Martello     
 Towers were built later following the 
 pattern of a round tower at Cap       
 Mortella in Corsica.  The             
 round towers in Grouville Bay are 36  
 feet high, with a base diameter of 34 
 feet.  The walls are 8 feet thick at  
 the base, narrowing to 6 feet at the  
 crest.  The doorway is raised above   
 ground to make entry difficult for the
 enemy.  Round Tower Number 4 has been 
 added to and converted into a house.
