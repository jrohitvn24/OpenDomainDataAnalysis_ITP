		<title>17CONSERVATION AND POLLUTION</title>
		<content> Following the successful International
 Garden Festival in Liverpool the Local
 Authority is following a similar      
 approach in developing an area of     
 derelict land known as Caulms Wood.At 
 the moment many young trees of various
 kinds have been planted, but it is    
 intended to also have 5 theme gardens,
 wild flower gardens,evergreen and     
 flowering tree displays,an adventure  
 playground and a viewing point looking
 over Dewsbury. Other attempts within  
 the area have been made to improve the
 environment but pollution is still a  
 problem. Pollution can be caused by   
 car fumes, factories, and often by    
 animals fouling the pavement.There is 
 also dangerous litter like glass, old 
 refrigerators, plastic bags, tin cans 
 and mattresses.The most common litter 
 in Chickenley  was cigarette ends     
 and we found 7736 of them in one day. </content>
