		<title>14BIOGRAPHY-HENRI WINSTANELY</title>
		<content>  {Henri Winstanely}lived in{Littlebury
 his biography starts when he built the
 first Eddystone{Light-house}.He was a 
 clerk at the works to Charles II at   
 Audley End House.He built himself a   
 house in thr meadow opposite the      
 church.At the church,fantastic tricks 
 were played on visitors.Among the     
 curious things invented and made by   
 this unusual man were,an armchair     
 which imprisoned anyone who sat in    
 it,a slipper lying on the floor which 
 gave a shock to anyone who attempted  
 to pick it up,and a trap door which   
 precipitated the visitor into the next
 room!!                                
   By 1703 his great lighthouse was    
 completed and had already been tested 
 in minor storms.In November of that   
 year,came a great storm in which the  
 superstructure was totally destroyed. 
 Winstanely and five friends perished. </content>
