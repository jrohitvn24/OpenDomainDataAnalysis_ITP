		<title>10THE KINGSWOOD ESTATE</title>
		<content> We went for a walk around the         
{Kingswood}estate from the{Danesholme  
 estate.The buildings on the two       
 estates are very{similar},although we 
 think that there is more grass on     
 Danesholme.There were lots of back    
 alleys which made the estate appear   
 like a{maze.                          
   Quite a few of the houses were not  
 lived in and had been vandalised.There
 was a lot of repair and building work 
 going on .                            
   We met some of the residents on the 
 estate and they told us that there was
 not much to do on the estate.         
   Some of the shops on the estates had
 there windows covered over with       
 hardboard to stop them from being     
{smashed.                              
   When we were walking around the     
 estate we came across a{plaque}saying 
 that the estate was well{designed!    </content>
