		<content> Only 3% of the male population is     
 engaged in agriculture despite the    
 rural location.A greater involvement  
 could be anticipated but with greater 
 mechanisation and an increase in the  
 number of larger sized farm units,    
 there is less agricultural employment 
 available.                            
 The major sources of employment are   
 some dozen miles away in{Cheltenham,  
{Gloucester}&amp; a little nearer,         
{Tewkesbury.}The chief employers are   
{Smith's Industries,Dowtys &amp; G.C.H.Q.} 
 with a small number of self-employed  
 businessmen,bank managers &amp; retired   
 people making up the remainder of the 
 population.Most of these people are   
 not indigenous to the area and are    
 basically in the senior executive/    
 professional roles.These people have  
 settled here since the early 1970's.
