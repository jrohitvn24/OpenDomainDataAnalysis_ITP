		<title>14GRAPES AT BERE FERRERS</title>
		<content>   The vineyard at Bere Ferrers is the 
 only one in Britain to grow vines from
 cuttings in plastic tunnels.They were 
 two year old plants that had been     
 grown in the open air.The vines are   
 protected by tunnels on either        
 side,the roots spreading to sixty     
 feet to find water.They are fertilised
 by manure outside the tunnels.Pruning 
 must be done constantly or there is   
 not enough air and defoliating takes  
 place once a year.There are at present
 nine tunnels with two more on the way.
   Fermenting stopped last year-too    
 cold.They have been brought up this   
 year to have a secondary ferment and  
 this year'grapes will be put into last
 year's wine to sweeten it because you 
 cannot add sugar to Common Market     
 wine.                                 
   These grapes produce a light table  
 wine-a Riesling and a Muscat.         </content>
