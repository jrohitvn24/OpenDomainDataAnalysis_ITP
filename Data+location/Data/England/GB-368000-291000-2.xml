		<content> In the 20th. century, the character of
 Bridgnorth has changed dramatically.  
 Most of the 11,000 people living in   
 the town are forced to travel to the  
 West Midland conurbation for work and 
 in effect Bridgnorth is a dormitory   
 town.  The industries of the town     
 employ little more than 1,000 of the  
 working inhabitants and although      
 others work in shops, offices and     
 commercial enterprises in Bridgnorth, 
 the main roads out of town are very   
 busy both morning and evening as      
 workers leave and return to their     
 homes.  Housing developments have     
 sprung up all around the town, but the
 town centre remains largely unchanged 
 with narrow streets and the usual     
 traffic congestion associated with    
 market towns.  Kidderminster is 21    
 kilometres away, Wolverhampton 24     
 kilometres and Shrewsbury 33 kms.     </content>
