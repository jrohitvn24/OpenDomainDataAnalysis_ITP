		<content>    The present church building was    
 built by Augustine Monks, and is 1,310
 years old.                            
    There are six church bells,which   
 are kept in the church tower. All the 
 bells except bell No.4 were made by   
 John Taylor and Co. from Loughborough.
 The oldest bell was made in 1604 and  
 its weight is 9cwt. There are 40 pews 
 in the church.These are 225 years old.
    In the graves yard are many graves 
 so there is a plan of where people are
 buried so people can find the correct 
 grave easily. The earliest gravestone 
 is inside the church,dated 1570.      
    The Vicar of the church, in 1985,  
 is the Reverand Osbourne. He has      
 conducted 90 marriage services and he 
 has different robes for different     
 occasions in the Christian Calendar.
