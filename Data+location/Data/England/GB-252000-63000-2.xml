		<content> We do not have an{army barracks}in our
 D-Block, but we do have one about two 
 miles away. But some{Royal Marines}   
 come and train in our area. Sometimes 
 they pull a barrel of water on an axle
 up{Shaugh Hill,}but mostly they come  
 to our area for jogging or perhaps    
 using our village for patrol work in  
 preparation for posting to{Northern   
{Ireland.}The barracks are at {        
{Bickleigh}and in {Shaugh Prior}the    
 gunfire of the marines training on    
 their rifle range can be heard .      
 We get quite a lot of low flying      
 planes and helicopters and once a     
 Harrier came down and was based at    
 the airport in{Plymouth}which is      
 owned by {Brymon Airways.}
