		<title>09LAW AND ORDER</title>
		<content>{Law and Order}is officially maintained
 by a{Policeman}who is resident in     
 Sinnington, a village about 9 miles   
 away. He makes regular visits to the  
 village and generally keeps his 'ear  
 to the ground'. This is not a         
 difficult task in such a small        
 community as local people seem to know
 most of what is going on around them. 
 Some trouble is experienced in the    
 Holiday Season with petty crime and   
 drunken problems. Stealing valuables  
 from cars parked at Beauty Spots and  
 the syphoning of petrol also causes   
 some nuisance.                        
 There is a Police House with existing 
 cells but now it is a private house.  
 The cells were apparantly put to good 
 use in the time of the Mining Boom    
 when many an inebriated miner slept it
 off in a cell.
