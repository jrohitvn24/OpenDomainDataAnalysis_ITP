		<content>  MOST OF THE PEOPLE MOVED HERE BECAUSE
 OF THE COUNTRYSIDE,2 PEOPLE MOVED     
 BECAUSE OF JOBS,AND ONE BOY MOVED FROM
 LONDON BECAUSE HIS MUM BOUGHT A       
 SHOP.BEFORE HE LIVED IN LONDON HE     
 LIVED IN MALAYA FOR 3 YEARS,HE THEN   
 LIVED IN LONDON FOR 7 YEARS,SO HE WAS 
 NOT USED TO OUR AREA BUT HE STILL     
 LIKES THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN THE     
 VILLAGE.HE HAS A BROTHER OF 7 AND A   
 SISTER OF 2.HE SAID HE LIKES LONDON   
 BETTER BECAUSE YOU CAN PLAY ANYWHERE. 
  THE RECTOR'S SON LIVED IN NOTTINGHAM 
 AND THEN MOVED TO WEST HALLAM AND HE  
 LIKES THE AREA MORE THAN WHERE HE     
 LIVED BEFORE BECAUSE THE GARDEN AND   
 HOUSE ARE BIGGER AND THE SHOPS AND    
 PLAYING AREAS ARE CLOSER THAN WHERE HE
 LIVED BEFORE.
