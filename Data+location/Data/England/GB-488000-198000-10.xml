		<title>10The Chiltern Hospital(cont.)</title>
		<content>  Over a thousand patients are treated 
 each year,about four each week are    
 children. They are mostly in-patients.
 Over sixty surgeons work at the       
 hospital and operations are performed 
 there every week. It is an acute care 
 hospital and not a casualty hospital. 
  The patients have their breakfast at 
 half past seven. They may have coffee,
 tea or fruit juice whenever they want.
 The chef cooks over three hundred     
 meals a day. At lunch they have three 
 choices for the main course and two   
 for dinner. If they do not want what  
 is on the menu the chef will cook them
 something else. Special menus are sent
 to the patients who can choose what   
 they want.                            
  The beds in the hospital are very    
 elaborate;the patients can have them  
 in many different positions,so that   
 they are as comfortable as possible.  </content>
