		<content> The owners had a lot of potato fields.
 Some fields had already been harvested
 for their new potatoes.The earlier    
 they are drawn the higher price they  
 get.In four &amp; a half acres they       
 normaly got 50 tons of potatoes.To do 
 a field by hand would take from       
 Tuesday to Friday.The machine would be
 a lot cheaper,because of the less men,
 but it takes longer.One field of      
 potatoes was for Smiths Crisps.A pipe 
 ran through the fields for irrigating 
 the crops.The water costs Â£1.17 per   
 1000 gallons.They use 80000 gallons a 
 day.They have a lot of beef cattle on 
 their farm in Connor Downs but not so 
 many at the farm we went to.The cattle
 get slaughtered at 10 months old.The  
 bulls that we saw were 7 months old.  
 They were dehorned at 3 weeks.Their   
 farm has 200 acres,60 of which is     
 rented.                               </content>
