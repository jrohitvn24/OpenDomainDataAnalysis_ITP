		<content> Leisure activities in Witherley today 
 are church choir, W.I., Bingo,        
 Field Day, dart matches, and football 
 matches.                              
                                       
 Activities that used to be in         
 Witherley were play-school, Brownies, 
 Guides and Church Lads' and           
 Girls' Brigade. The reason why        
 Brownies and Guides stopped was       
 that the leader married and lived     
 some where else, which meant she could
 not attend.                           
                                       
 We have done a survey of our class.   
 These are some of the activities that 
 children would like to see:           
                                       
    Cubs           Roller skating      
    Scouts         Pony club           
    Ranger Guides  Over 30's Club      
    Discos         Over 60's Club      </content>
