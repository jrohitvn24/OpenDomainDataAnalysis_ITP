		<content> "I am a  working housewife in my early
thirties.   I  am  married  with  three
children  and  live in  the  Fordhouses
area.    I work  as a  shelf packer  in
Sainsbury's Supermarket and earn twenty
pounds for  12 hours a week.   I do not
like  my work  because it is heavy  and
I have to work in the evenings. I would
prefer to be  a library  assistant  but
it would be a  difficult job  to obtain
as I do not have the qualifications.   
                                       
 The local environment is quite nice in
some parts  but is very untidy  in some
others. It could be  improved  by  more
leisure facilities and food shops.     
                                       
 There is a need for places where young
people could meet.  I  think  that  the
greatest  cause for concern in the area
is  vandalism  and  the danger of being
mugged."                               </content>
