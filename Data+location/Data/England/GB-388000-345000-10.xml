		<title>10IMPRESSIONS OF SHELTON</title>
		<content>My name is Angela Smith.I am ten years 
old and live in Shelton.I attend       
Cauldon Primary School which was built 
in the last century about l897.It is a 
mixture of old and new buildings but   
has no green playing fields.It could be
better!There is Hanley Park nearby     
though,which has swings and a lake.    
My house is between the two shopping   
centres of Hanley and Stoke,so we do   
not have to walk a long way to go      
shopping.Shelton is quite pleasant but 
it could be improved.They could let    
bicycles in and keep motor vehicles    
out.                                   
During our local industrial holiday    
which we call the"Potters Fortnight"   
the place is very dull and quiet with  
not much to do apart from playing      
sports.                                
                                       
                                       </content>
