		<content> The area covers parts of the parishes 
 of Aylesford, Ditton, East Malling and
 Larkfield, Leybourne and West Malling.
 The northern portion is mainly        
 residential and dissected by the A20  
 Maidstone to London road. The M20     
 motorway and the river Medway pass    
 through the NE corner. Further south  
 lies the Maidstone to Victoria railway
 line. Along the A20 is the ribbon     
 development so typical of the era     
 between the two World Wars. During the
 past 30 years new housing estates have
 enveloped the older residential areas.
 The southern part is predominantly    
 fruit farming with growers enticing   
 people to "Pick your own". Here too,  
 East Malling Research Station, with   
 its carefully tended acreage, snuggles
 discreetly into the landscape.
