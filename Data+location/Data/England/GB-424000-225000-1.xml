		<title>01Adlestrop to Cornwell</title>
		<content> The area includes the Gloucestershire 
 village of Adlestrop and the beautiful
 estate of Daylesford House (Built by  
 Warren Hastings) and the hamlet       
 of Daylesford. Over the boundary into 
 Oxfordshire is the quaint village of  
 Cornwell with its Manor House and also
 the substantial buildings and grounds 
 of Kignham Hill School for boys.      
                                       
 The land is farmed on a sizeable scale
 by the estates and a few tenant and   
 owner farmers. The agriculture is     
 predominately arable with some dairy  
 units of over 100 cows and one or two 
 flocks of sheep and some horses. The  
 woodlands range from young plantaions 
 to belts of spectacular, mature beech.
 The population is fairly static. The  
 whole area is well maintained and     
 bears an air of some wealth.
