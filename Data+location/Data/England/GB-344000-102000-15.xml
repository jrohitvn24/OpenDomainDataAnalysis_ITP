		<content>  NEW HOUSES: appeal to young          
 families_usually detached, made of    
 reconstructed stone to blend with     
 older properties (yellowish in        
 colour)Four bedroomed with bathroom , 
 additional toilet, gardens, living    
 room, dining room and kitchen. Prices 
 around Â£45,000.                       
 several new propties are at present   
 being erected in the area for         
 sale, hopefully to young families.    
 (there in some concern in the area    
 that young people are leaving the     
 villages and                          
 older retired people are replacing    
 them)                                 
 these new propertes can be purchased  
 outright but a scheme allowing the    
 buyer to purchase part of his home    
 is being introduced.
