		<title>10WILBERFOSS THE POLICEMAN.</title>
		<content>     Wilberfoss does not have its own  
 policeman at present, a fact bemoaned 
 by some and cheered by others.The     
 policeman responsible for covering the
 village lives in Stamford Bridge,some 
 4 miles away. If needed he can quickly
 arrive in his ubiquitous panda car.   
    Asked about the job of a rural     
 policeman he said that he enjoys it   
 as it is possible to get to know      
 people well. The most common crime he 
 has to deal with is burglary,there    
 being many desirable properties on his
 patch.  The most serious crime he has 
 dealt with was a murder a couple of   
 years ago.  Generally life is much    
 quieter in the country, but at Christ-
 mas he has to be on the look-out for  
 turkey rustlers and dishonest members 
 of the York citizenry who frequent    
 local forest plantations by night in  
 order to dig up a free Xmas tree!     </content>
