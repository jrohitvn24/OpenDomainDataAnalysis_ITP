		<title>17 THE SANDPITS - CALNE</title>
		<content> 90 million years ago the Bristol      
 Channel covered the sandpits in       
 Calne.Sand has been dug up from the   
 pits since 1910.The pits were dug out 
 using buckets and spades. When they   
 had dug down far enough water came    
 up.They filled the holes in with the  
 gravel which was dug up with the      
 sand.They are called the "Humpty      
 Dumps".They took the sand to their    
 buyers by horse and cart.Then they    
 used petrol and diesel machinery.Big  
 machinery takes out 15 foot of        
 topping.The "Caterpillar 613" is the  
 only one in Europe and it was made in 
 Texas. It is huge , the tyres are     
 about 6 foot tall.7 people are        
 employed there and there are 4        
 machines for extracting the sand. On a
 good day 300 tons of sand are         
 extracted.When the sand is exhausted  
 the area is returned to agriculture.  </content>
