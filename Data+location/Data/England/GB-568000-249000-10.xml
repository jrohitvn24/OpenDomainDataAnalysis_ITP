		<content> IT is most important to work safely   
 when using chemicals.Staff at {wychem}
 have regular check-ups and blood      
 tests,which are required by law.No    
 women are employed in case an unborn  
 baby is harmed in any way.When        
 handling different substances the men 
 wear                                  
 masks,goggles,helmets,boiler-suitsand 
 boots.A system of labelling each      
 chemical ie. toxic, irritantpoison    
 etc. is always used.Wychem have an    
 enormous book from which to follow    
 instructions when sending chemicals by
 road.A book is also kept as a record  
 of where everything is at any given   
 time.Extractor fans keep the air clean
 for the workers. Waste material is put
 into effluent tanks and               
 neutralised,then put into a land-fill 
 pit hundreds of feet underground.
