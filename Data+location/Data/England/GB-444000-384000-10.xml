		<title>10Ethnic Minorities in Aston</title>
		<content> Mr Holder,now of Aston,is a black man,
 resident in England for 28 yrs with 3 
 self-confident black children, Anne   
 12, Duncan 14 &amp; Liam 16.They have been
 called names like chocolate drop,     
 nigger &amp; told to get back to Africa.  
 Despite racial discrimination they    
 have plenty of white friends.Father   
 owns 2 taxis in a successful business 
 &amp; all the family like living in South 
 Yorkshire.Adrian is black, very shy &amp; 
 quiet living in a white household &amp;   
 community.He thinks people are stupid 
 who call him nigger, blacky, chocolate
 drop &amp; gollywog.A local shop owner has
 refused to serve him &amp; made him wait  
 till last.A white man attempted to    
 knock him down saying this is what I  
 think of niggers.Racialism bothers him
 a great deal.
