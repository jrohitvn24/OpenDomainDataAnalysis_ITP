		<content> North Tanton Farm's 200 acres belong  
 to Mr.Neil Metcalf. The farm's        
 boundary has a piece cut out of it    
 where a field was lost in a game of   
 cards. He breeds pheasants, and has   
 about 90 being reared by broody       
 hens in chicken runs. He also stores  
 caravans for people with small urban  
 gardens and one small field is full of
 caravans. A 10 cm. flint knife was    
 found in one of his fields, where     
 there are the remains of an iron age  
 village to the N.E. of the farm house.
  The village of Tameston now lies     
 under the sheep pasture west of the   
 farm. Most of the fields are under    
 wheat,barley and potatoes. All odd    
 corners of the farm have trees planted
 as a conservation measure: Mr.Metcalf 
 has been planting 200-300 a year.
