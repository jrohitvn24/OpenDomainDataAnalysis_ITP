		<content>   The average{family}has three        
 children. Most families have domestic 
{pets;}the most popular being the dog, 
 but goldfish, birds, and guinea pigs  
 closely follow.                       
  {Household chores}can be family      
 events such as:- Washing clothes,     
 ironing, sewing, vacuuming, polishing,
 tidying rooms, cooking and shopping.  
 The majority of jobs are done by      
 women, but children often help by     
 doing errands such as washing dishes  
 and making their beds.                
   The time of the{main meal}varies,   
 just after midday or early evening    
 being popular choices. Some children  
 help in the preparation of the meal by
 peeling potatoes, chopping vegetables 
 or setting the table. A favourite meal
 could consist of chips, meat, beans   
 and for dessert perhaps trifle,       
 fruitpie, crumble or cheesecake.      </content>
