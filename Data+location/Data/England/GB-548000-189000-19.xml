		<title>19AN OAP'S DAY</title>
		<content>  I collect my pension on Thursday.On  
 that day I got up at 6.30 a.m.For     
 breakfast I had fruit juice,boiled    
 egg,B and B cereal,toast,marmalade and
 coffee.I don't have the T.V. on but I 
 do listen to the radio.The news was   
 on.                                   
  After getting my pension I went      
 shopping and had a light lunch.Then I 
 read the daily Telegraph and the Daily
 Mail.I don't have any hobbies,only the
 wife!I mostly read and watch T.V. if  
 its worth watching.I had a suprise    
 visit from relatives in Suffolk in the
 evening.I went to bed at 11.45p.m.    
  Sunday is different;it is a relaxing 
 day.Even as a pensioner you can have a
 different day on Sunday.              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
