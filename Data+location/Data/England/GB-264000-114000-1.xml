		<title>01Burrington Parish SW</title>
		<content> This area is the SW corner of         
 Burrington Parish plus small portions 
 of Ashreigney and Chulmleigh Parishes.
 It is bisected by River Taw, salmon   
 fishing, the railway line and the A377
 road which run from Exeter to         
 Barnstaple. Burrington Parish         
 boundaries are the Taw and the        
 Mullybrook. The land is very rural.   
 Almost no public transport. Dairy and 
 sheep farming with corn crops grown   
 from animal feeding. Although there   
 are mainly farmhouses, there are some 
 large gentlemens residences. Hansford 
 House, Handsford Barton, Colleton     
 Manor and Leigh House. The buildings  
 are almost without exception old. The 
 Planning regulations ake it impossible
 to build outside the centre of the    
 village. My own house, Pennyhop (named
 I beleive since it cost one penny to  
 travel by Stage Coach to Chulmleigh ) </content>
