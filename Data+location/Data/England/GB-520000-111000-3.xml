		<content> The parish of Edburton consists of 5  
 major farms 2 of which are old manors.
 The Saxon church of St Andrew stands  
 on a slight hill with panoramic views 
 through the trees to the South Downs &amp;
 to the weald to the N. The building of
 flint &amp; stone is of classic simplicity
 Its most unusual feature is the leaden
 font. The villagers are baptised,     
 married &amp; buried here. Of those who   
 have left Edburton many make a return 
 visit. The school at Edburton has been
 turned into a private house. Children 
 travel by bus to Upper Beeding primary
 school. Tottington Manor besides      
 having its own farm is now a          
 residential hotel &amp; resteraunt. It has
 a large &amp; unusual dovecot standing    
 separate from other buildings. Shrings
 sell smoked fish of many kinds can be 
 obtained. They are suppliers of smoked
 salmon to airlines a big industry.    </content>
