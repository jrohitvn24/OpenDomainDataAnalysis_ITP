		<title>04 Hardingstone Primary School</title>
		<content>   The school was built in 1966 and is 
not very big. It has 128 children in   
five classes. They start school at 4+  
and leave,usually to go to Roade       
School, at 11.                         
   The school building, which is mainly
flat roofed, is in good condition and  
the staff think that it does not need  
much improvement. The design is quite  
different from Wootton school as at    
Hardingstone most of the classrooms are
joined on to the hall.                 
   The school has a pleasant friendly  
atmosphere and the work done is very   
similar to that at Wootton except that 
they do more projects. The children's  
favourite lessons are mathematics,     
English and art.Some of the teachers   
think that computers will not become   
important unless there are more of     
them available in schools.
