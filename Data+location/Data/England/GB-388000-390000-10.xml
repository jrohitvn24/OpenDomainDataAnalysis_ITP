		<content>  A popular event in{Stockport}is the  
{ Daffodil Marathon.}This is organised 
 by the{Leisure Services Division of   
{ Stockport MBC.}First started in      
 1982,it attracts over 1500 runners. A 
 year ago a 6.5 mile Minithon for under
 18's was introduced and 860 children  
 competed in 1985.                     
  The marathon is held on the second   
 Sunday in April. The start and finish 
 is in{Woodbank Park.}This is no easy  
 run as the river valleys of the       
 Goyt,Tame and Mersey make a hilly     
 course.                               
  Crowds line the streets.Traffic is   
 disrupted. People run for charity.    
 Some take it very seriously. The great
 thing is that the event enjoys the    
 support of the local community by     
 sponsors,spectators and copetitors.   
  Long may it continue!
