		<title>18ODDINGLEY:NETHERWOOD FARM.</title>
		<content> This 17th century farm is set between 
 two woods,neither of which belong to  
 the farm.Therefore it's name became   
{Netherwood.}The farm is 120 acres,of  
 which 90 acres are grassland (52 acres
 of this being cut for hay) and 30     
 acres barley.In the summer this       
 produces 7000 bales of hay and        
 2000 bales of straw.The main product  
 is milk. Most of this milk is sold to 
 local dairies.However the family      
 process some of the milk to produce   
 cheese, cream and yoghurt which they  
 eat themselves and sell to            
 friends.They also have a small number 
 of turkeys which they fatten and sell 
 locally at Christmas.In 1806{Richard  
{Hemmings}dead body(see page 14 ) was  
 dragged through a hedge  and made a   
 gap which to this day has never grown 
 back.                                 
                                       </content>
