		<title>10FARMING</title>
		<content> Farming is influenced by three main   
 factors,{1,soil.}This consists of wet 
 acid silts and clays and is therefore 
 more suitable to grass growing than   
 arable crops.{2,climate.}Average      
 rainfall is 1015-1524mm per year and  
 although temperatures on the whole are
 mild, except in January and February, 
 we do suffer from very strong westerly
 winds.{3,politics.}This is a dairy and
 livestock area and those farmers      
 producing milk have recently had the  
 production curtailed by the Quota     
 System introduced by the EEC to try   
 and reduce the butter and milk        
 surplusses in the Community.Less than 
 a quarter of the land is given over to
 corn growing and that is mainly barley
 for stock feed.
