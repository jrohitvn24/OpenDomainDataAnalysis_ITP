		<title>15KEMBLE RAILWAY</title>
		<content>  In 1841,{I.K.Brunel}built the {      
{Swindon - Cheltenham}line. The local  
 squire insisted that the railway had  
 to go underground through Kemble so a 
 tunnel was built 500 yards long. A    
 special Act of Parliament was needed  
 before{Kemble Station}was built       
 because the squire's daughter opposed 
 it. The station is by "The Tavern".   
 There used to be an old platform by   
 the side of it and one of the lines   
 went to {Cirecester}and one to{       
{Tetbury.}A lot of commuters park their
 cars at the station and go to work in{
{Swindon}or{London.                    
{ }The station is very attractive and  
 well-cared for. It has been judged the
 best kept small station in the West of
 England for the last two years.
