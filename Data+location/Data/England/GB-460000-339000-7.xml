		<title>07Churches in  Carlton</title>
		<content> In Carlton there are five different   
 types of Churches of all shapes and   
 sizes.Another thing about the churches
 is that they are either on Carlton    
 Hill or Church Street.The oldest and  
 largest Church is the Carlton Parish  
 Church which is 101 years old.        
 The newest Church is probably the     
 Baptist Church on Church Street.      
 There is a Catholic church that looks 
 quite new but next door to it is the  
 original church which is now used for 
 a playschool.As well as services on   
 Sunday nearly all the churches have   
 things going on during the week for   
 example the Methodist church on       
 Carlton Hill as a womans bright hour  
 at sometime during the week.Another   
 thing is that there is only christian 
 places of worship in Carlton.But at   
 the other end of Carlton Hill there   
 is a Hindu temple.                    </content>
