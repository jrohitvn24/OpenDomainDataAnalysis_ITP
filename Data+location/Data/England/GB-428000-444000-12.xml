		<title>12UPPER AND LOWER WEARDLEY</title>
		<content>   Residents in Upper and Lower        
 Weardley include several families,a   
 farmer and a gamekeeper.A typical     
 family consists of a marketing        
 manager,his wife and 2 children. They 
 travel to Harrogate twice monthly,and 
 Leeds and Bradford infrequently,      
 shopping in Otley and Harrogate.      
 The farmer travels into Leeds and     
 Harrogate 3 times a week, while the   
 gamekeeper does little travelling     
 because his job is in the local area. 
 He might visit Harrogate once a       
 fortnight but hardly ever goes to     
 Leeds and Bradford.                   
   Leisure time is spent watching T.V. 
 and gardening.The gamekeeper's        
 pheasants are featured on the T.V.    
 programme "Emmerdale Farm". Residents 
 agree that the main asset of the      
 villages is their peacefulness.The    
 drawback is the isolation.            </content>
