		<title>12 BRERETON VILLAGE VANISHES?</title>
		<content>What is a village? "An assemblage, of  
houses etc, smaller than a town" says a
dictionary. "A friendly, caring        
atmosphere" say many Brereton residents
Brereton grew to be a mining village   
within it's own parish from Saxon times
Today Brereton has many amenities      
including a Resident's Society. It has 
lost it's Parish Council and           
policeman.  It is called "Rugeley",    
it's neighbouring town's name, by the  
Post Office. Is it still a village?    
"Yes" say 150 of 230 residents         
questioned, "and it should stay that   
way" 37 locals believe that with a     
population of 7000 and no clear        
demarcation  between  Rugeley and      
Brereton what was once a village is now
a suburb. They  regret it's loss of    
identity. 43 residents contentedley    
believe Brereton to be part of Rugeley.
