		<title>09WILDLIFE AT WOODHALL</title>
		<content> Quite a lot of species of birds were  
 seen at Woodhall starting off with    
 Swifts.The Swifts come to Britain for 
 the summer like the Swallows.And the  
 River Wharfe has enough insects to    
 keep the Swifts hunger down.The Swifts
 feed in the air and hardley ever land.
 Willow Warbles could be heard and at  
 one time could be seen darting across 
 the river,skimming the surface.Outside
 the wood a cuckoo could be heard only 
 in the far distance.A lot of Rooks    
 were about,their nests were in the    
 tall trees beside the river.The type  
 of woodland was deciduous,and is great
 for birds like Tree Creepers,and,Blue,
 Great ,and Coal Tits.The fox          
 population has decreased rapidly over 
 the past ten years and foxes are very 
 rare at Woodhall.The River Wharfe has 
 many plants like plant weed.
