		<title>01BIGGLESWADE, BEDS.</title>
		<content> Biggleswade is a market town of some  
 12,000 inhabitants, situated in the   
 east of the county 45 miles north of  
 London &amp; 23 miles west of Cambridge.  
 The name derives from 'waed', a ford, 
 &amp; the personal name 'Bicca', i.e.{    
{Bicca's Ford.}Bounded on the west by  
 the river Ivel, Biggleswade was       
 formerly an important coaching stop on
 the old A1 main road, &amp; indeed the    
 town's development has been dominated 
 by major changes in transport. The    
 advent of the {Great Northern Railway}
 in 1850 brought prosperity, as produce
 &amp; vegetables could be sent daily to   
 London for sale. In the 1960s a bypass
 was built, heavy through traffic was  
 diverted, &amp; the town is now relatively
 peaceful. However Biggleswade is      
 designated the main future growth area
 in E.Beds. &amp; a substanial building    
 programme has alresdy begun.          </content>
