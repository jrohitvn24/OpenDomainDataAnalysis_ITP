		<content> Our block is mainly open country and  
 there is a paucity of people which    
 probably means that information       
 gathered is not truly representative  
 of a larger sample. However within    
 the area the{population}is very mixed 
 representing three (from village,     
 council estate and executive housing) 
 quite distinct social strata of       
 society.The average size of{family    
 is about 2.8 children per couple.There
 are a few cases of single parent      
 families but more cases of split      
{marriages.}There is certainly evidence
 that the people are living to a       
 greater age and it was pleasing that  
 of those questioned (Roseworth) about 
 15% of homes had grandma or grandad   
 living with son or daughter. Children 
 have a caring attitude to the{elderly 
 and in many cases give tangible       
 assistance.                           </content>
