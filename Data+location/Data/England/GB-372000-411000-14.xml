		<title>14Interview at Hill Farm</title>
		<content> We visited Hill Farm which is situated
 at the top of a steep hill.Mr Botteril
 the farmer,told us that he had lived  
 there for 57 years.He has 54 acres of 
 land,devoted entirely to sown and     
 fertilised grassland that is used for 
 grazing or cut for hay or for sileage.
 He has 54 Friesian milking cows and   
 they produce 4 litres each  per day   
 on average.A tanker picks the milk up 
 at 9am.The herd is a'flying herd'     
 meaning that the farmer does not breed
 his own cattle but sells them for beef
 and then buys fresh stock.His fields  
 yield 5,000 bales of hay per year and 
 this is stored in two barns for use as
 fodder.His latest venture is to rear a
 special breed of cattle that produce  
 lean beef.He also has 1,000 battery   
 hens producing at least one egg each  
 per day.He has 13 different types of  
 machinery to help with harvesting etc.</content>
