		<title>06CHURCH-EAST CARLTON</title>
		<content>The church was rebuilt in 1788 by Sir  
Geoffrey Palmer who owned the nearby   
Hall.It is now smaller than it used to 
be.There are six bells,but no local    
band of ringers.Electricity was        
installed in 1948 for the organ,lights 
and the clock which chimes the hours.  
There are box pews,people sitting in   
their own pew every time.Instead of    
Memorials on the walls,people have     
given gifts.Recent gifts have been a   
cross,prayer books, vestments and a    
wafer box.                             
East Carlton had its own Rector until  
1964.It now shares one with Cottingham 
cum Middleton.                         
The most popular service is Family     
Communion,the least popular being      
Evensong.About twelve to fourteen      
people attend Communion.
