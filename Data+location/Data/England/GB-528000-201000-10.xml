		<title>10THE PUMPING STATION-CUFFLEY.</title>
		<content> The pumping station near Wells Farm   
 was built between 1900 and 1920 and is
 due to be demolished.It was originally
 powered by steam, later it was        
 converted to diesel and now it is     
 powered by electricity.It pumps 18700 
 gallons of water a day,but it is only 
 in use for 11hours a day. They do not 
 have any staff permanently at the     
 pumping station but someone calls in  
 every other day to check everything is
 alright. The well is 100m deep and    
 3.5m across. Below 100m there is      
 another 33m bore hole which is only   
 30cm across.There are two tunnels     
 leading off from the well.One is 200m 
 long and the other is 330m long. These
 tunnels collect water from different  
 places when there is no water left in 
 the well.There are two cottages near  
 the pumping station used by employees 
 of the Water Board.                   </content>
