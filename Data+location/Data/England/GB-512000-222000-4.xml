		<title>04School and the Community</title>
		<content>  We believe rural schools have a      
 special place within the communities  
 they serve,and the following will     
 explain how our school fulfils this   
 role.Firstly,we are a meeting place - 
 parents,children and teachers chat    
 together at the beginning and end of  
 the day.Our notice board advertises   
 local events.Every month we hold a    
 school assembly in the village church,
 attended by local people and parents. 
 Social and fund-raising events are    
 planned with local interests in mind. 
 At major Christian festivals we invite
 the Senior Citizens to join us and    
 share in refreshments.The monthly     
 Mother and Baby clinic is starting to 
 be held in the school hall,to give    
 mums a chance to get to know each     
 other.This term,we have started a     
 school newspaper which will focus on  
 local events,particularly road closure</content>
