		<title>07HOUSING IN CROUGHTON 2</title>
		<content> In 1984 plans were announced to build 
 300 new houses on land at RAF         
 Croughton to accommodate USAF         
 personnel from Croughton and Upper    
 Heyford.  Vigorous campaigning from   
 parish and district councils and many 
 local individuals led to the eventual 
 withdrawal of the proposal, and the   
 houses are now to be built at         
 Bicester.  Significant factors of this
 project were that the houses were to  
 be financed by the US government who  
 had already allocated the funds to be 
 used within the financial year 1984,  
 and that MoD could in fact have gone  
 ahead without agreement from any other
 body. The main burden of the village's
 protest was the total imbalance that  
 the introduction of such a large      
 American  community would create      
 within the village.
