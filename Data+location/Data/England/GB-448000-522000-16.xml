		<title>16NUCLEAR CAMPAIGN</title>
		<content> The campaign continued into the New   
 Year of 1985 with a young teenager    
 making a T.V.appearance on behalf     
 of the 141,000 children of{Cleveland.}
 "I think if we get nuclear waste under
 our town no one will want to come here
 and bring new industry.               
  Unless we get new jobs in the area   
 there is no future for the kids here,"
 she explained.                        
  At last,to the great joy and relief  
 of the people of Cleveland,15 months  
 after the formation of{BAND}the       
 withdrawal of{NIREX}from{Billingham}  
 was announced in the{House of Commons.
  The local{M.P's}and the community    
 were praised for a model campaign.    
 The people of Cleveland regained their
 future!
