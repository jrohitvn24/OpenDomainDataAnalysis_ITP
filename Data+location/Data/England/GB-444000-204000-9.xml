		<content> Cumnor village has many old houses of 
 various periods, infilled with newer  
 homes. After 1920 there was much      
 building between the old village and  
 Botley. On cumnor Hill the houdes tend
 to be large with big gardens thouh    
 recently many have been built         
 infilling these large plots. Private  
 building of smaller houses has taken  
 place in the Chawley and Appleton Road
 areas.                                
 At Farmoor a small community of houses
 built betwen the wars along the       
 Eynsham Road has developed into a     
 larger one with the building of many  
 private houses of the samller type    
 especially between the older houses   
 and the Farmoor reservoir.            
 Considerable private building by      
 developers is taking place at Cumnor  
 and Dean Court.
