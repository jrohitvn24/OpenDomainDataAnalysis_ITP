		<title>02Our Domesday Walk</title>
		<content> We set of from Kilsby on our circular 
 walk. We had to mark all the stiles,  
 bridges and gates on our map.We came  
 to a kissing gate which led to a big  
 echo bridge. As we left Mrs Sparks put
 her foot in the mud.                  
 After stopping in the park at Barby   
 we carried on to the end of ridge     
 passing an unidentified, very big,    
 concrete block, and then went down the
 hill, past an enormous bull, to the   
 Oxford Canal. From the ridge you could
 see Onley Prison, but it looked like a
 holiday camp with soccer pitches.     
 We saw quite a few barges .By one     
 bridge we found an electric fence. We 
 tried touching it. We also tried it   
 when you hold hands. It really hurts. 
 We had dinner by the canal then went  
 across several big fields. We walked  
 passed Lysanders farm and back along  
 the A5. We passed Kilsby tunnel to end</content>
