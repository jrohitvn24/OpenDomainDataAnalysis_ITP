		<title>07LOCAL SHOPPING HABITS</title>
		<content> Murston is on the outskirts of        
 Sittingbourne.We asked 40 local people
 about their shopping habits,and their 
 opinions about local facilities.Most  
 people only used local shops in       
 emergencies or for just a few items   
 because the shops are convenient.The  
 majority felt the range of shops in   
 Murston was quite sufficient.Very few 
 people actually do their main weekly  
 shopping locally.Most felt it was     
 cheaper to travel to Sittingbourne to 
 shop.About 50% walk to the town centre
 to shop whilst the majority of the    
 remainder take their own cars.Very few
 people seem to use the bus service at 
 all.Some people have papers,milk and  
 soft drinks delivered to their homes.
