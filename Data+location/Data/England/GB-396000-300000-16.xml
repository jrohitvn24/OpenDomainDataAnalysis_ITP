		<title>16Elderly people in Willenhall</title>
		<content> Retired people are called Old Age     
 Pensioners or Senior Citizens.The age 
 of retirement is 60 for women and 65  
 for men.For a married couple the      
 pension is Â£64 for a single person it 
 is Â£36.Pensioners get free bus passes 
 which enables them to go anywhere in  
 the West Midlands free of charge after
 9.30a.m.They are also entitled to free
 treatment on the National Health,which
 includes free prescription charges,   
 free glasses,free dental charges etc. 
 There are also a number of Old Peoples
 Homes in the area where old people can
 live if they are disabled or if they  
 are not capable of looking after      
 themselves.There are 3 of these in our
 area,Meadow House,Short Heath House   
 and one in Stroud Avenue.There are    
 also some special bungalows supervised
 by a warden where elderly people can  
 live by themselves.                   </content>
