		<title>01  GENERAL - CHESTERTON</title>
		<content>  This area is almost totally          
 agricultural with one timber merchant'
 yard and factory situated on the      
 Fosseway a roman road which runs      
 through the block.The remains of a    
 roman station can only just be found  
 beside the road.There are nine farms  
 in the block which grow a variety of  
 crops and raise many types of animal  
 ranging from chicks to prize winning  
 cattle.The most striking feature in   
 the area is a windmill built for the  
 major landowning family in the 17th   
 century.The lake by the disused       
 watermill has been extended by the    
 present landowner to become a trout   
 fishing lake. The ancient Church which
 serves the hamlet of Chesterton Green 
 has several interesting tombs and an  
 attractive archway leading from the   
 remains of the medieval manor house   
 and fishponds.                        </content>
