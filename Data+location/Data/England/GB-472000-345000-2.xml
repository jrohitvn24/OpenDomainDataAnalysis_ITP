		<title>02Population Flintham.</title>
		<content> There are 236 people living in the    
 village of Flintham: 23 under 12 yrs; 
 30 up to 18 yrs; 38 up to 34 yrs; 110 
 up to 60 yrs &amp; 35 over 65 yrs. These  
 figures do not include Inholms Gardens
 or Coney Grey Spinney which are in the
 process of being sold by the MOD and  
 not all the houses have been occupied.
                                       
 Of the 236 people, 18 families have   
 lived in the village for less than 5  
 years - 52 people in all.             
                                       
 The working population is mainly ABC1 
 whereas the retired  are mainly C2DE. 
                                       
 The number of children has dropped    
 over the last few years - hopefully   
 more families with children will move 
 into the village as the RAF houses are
 sold.
