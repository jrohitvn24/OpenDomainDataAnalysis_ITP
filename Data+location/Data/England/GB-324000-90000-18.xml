		<title>18Problems for a Local Doctor</title>

    In{Seaton}there are 30 old peoples 
 homes,these are needed because in     
 every 100 patients, 36 are over 65 and
 17 are over 75. This means the doctors
  have to work very hard making about  
 5_20 home visits a day and 70 night   
 calls a year, because many of the old 
 are unable to leave their homes.      
                                       
    Unlike most doctors, Seaton doctors
 see more patients in the summer       
 because in every 10 weeks 2,000       
 holiday makers go for treatment.      
                                       
    They have to deal with at least 2  
 serious farm accidents a year.This is 
 mainly due to the steep land.         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
