		<title>20HOW WE DID THIS SURVEY-WALES</title>
		<content> This survey was done by class five of 
 Wales Junior School. We are all 9 &amp; 10
 years old.We started the survey in May
 1985 &amp; finished in July, although we  
 did not work solidly on it.           
          We began with the amenities  
 counts &amp; made several visits around   
 the area. Each child had 2 or 3       
 amenities to count. This was quite    
 hard going at times. We visited the   
 library for information &amp; used maps to
 help us. We did interviews with school
 children &amp; with local people in order 
 to collect our information together.  
          It was difficult to write the
 text as we had so much to say in such 
 a small space.We have done the writing
 by ourselves &amp; our teacher helped us  
 too. Doing this survey was not easy   
 but it was fun. We hope that we shall 
 be able to see the finished video disc
 when everything is completed.         </content>
