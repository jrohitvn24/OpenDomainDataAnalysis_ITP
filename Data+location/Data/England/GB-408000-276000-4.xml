 LOCAL HISTORY OF A PUPIL'S FAMILY.    
  "My school is Mill Lodge in Aqueduct 
 Road in Shirley.Long before the school
 and houses were built my great great  
 grandfather lived  at Brook Farm on   
 Green Lane.It was there before the    
 railway was cut.He worked on the farm 
 and kept cows and took the milk they  
 produced around the countryside in a  
 cart pulled by a horse.My grandmother 
 spent her childhood there.There were  
 only a few houses then and they had to
 walk to Shirley to do the shopping.The
 baker,the coalman and the paraffin    
 man came to sell at the door.The      
 entrance area of our school was the   
 blacksmith's known as "Bumper Roberts"</content>
