		<content>    This particular information is     
 representative of the other squares in
 the block. This kilometre square is   
 bounded by an outcrop behind High Mere
 Beck Farm by Marsh Grange in the north
 and by the spring on the main road    
 by Tippins Bridge. In the east the    
 square is bounded by Guards Farm.     
    The square has five residences but 
 mainly the square is fell-side land   
 and estuarial plain, heavily hedged,  
 with some slight evidence of hedges   
 being removed to increase field size. 
 As a consequence there is a noted     
 decrease in wild life habitat. Never  
 the less remaining grass land is very 
 rich and favours much varied wildlife.
 It is also noted that there are six   
 freshwater springs in this particular 
 square and similar numbers in the     
 others. This favours arable land.
