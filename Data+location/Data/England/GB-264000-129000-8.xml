		<content> Mr. Slade has lived in West Buckland  
 for six years,before he lived in      
 Epsom.He now lives in Rosebank        
 cottage.He moved here because his wife
 was offered a job in the hospital in  
 Barnstaple,he was retired and this    
 cottage was available.                
 Every morning he drives his wife into 
 Barnstaple and if needed drives her   
 round to local hospitals.             
 He likes the village because there is 
 less traffic,more fresh air and less  
 volume of commutor life.              
 His hobbies are writing short stories 
 for the radio,he does voluntary work  
 for RAF Chivenor,he plays cricket and 
 likes doing some  "fancy cooking".The 
 village shop is  good but he prefers  
 Barnstaple as he has to go in there   
 every day and there is a better       
 selection of goods.
