		<content> As the block is some distance from the
 sea, the river is a favoured venue for
 water sports. Two annual raft races   
 are held for amateur rafters and raise
 large sums of money each year for     
 various charities. They attract       
 entries from all over the country and 
 from all sections of the community.   
 The men's race, held in the spring, is
 the longer, covering 100 miles from   
 Hay-on-Wye to Chepstow, and extends   
 over three days with overnight        
 camping. The women's race takes place 
 in late summer over a shorter distance
 from Bridge Sollers to Ross-on-Wye.   
 The design and construction of the    
 rafts is prescribed.                  
 Canoeists also use the river, some    
 from a canoeing club in Hereford and  
 some from further afield, even as far 
 as London.
