		<title>01Change in Frimley Green</title>
		<content>   Frimley Green is mentioned in the   
{Domesday Book.}This area was          
 originally farming, woodlands and     
 heathland. Each farm had its own      
 farmhouse and many still exist today, 
 built as long as 400 years ago. Those 
 still standing are preserved by their 
 owners but the surrounding land has   
 been built on at an alarming rate     
 during the past 30 years.  Also RAOC  
 HQ is based on heathland for army     
 training and barracks.                
   The Worsley Road Estate, built as an
 experiment in 1958, has three types of
 housing. Several large estates have   
 since been erected. At present houses 
 are being constructed on many         
 remaining open spaces.                
   Houses of various types are provided
 to suit all needs. Commuters find the 
 area suitable as the M3 motorway is   
 close by.                             </content>
