		<title>01Landscape The Reculver Area</title>
		<content>The Reculver area is quite flat and    
open and consists mainly of farmland,  
fields and modern housing. There are no
main roads or shopping centre. On the  
northern side is the Thames Estuary and
a beach made up of shingle and mud     
bordered in parts by high sandy        
cliffs.Next to the beach is the remains
of a Roman fort and Reculver Towers,   
once a Saxon church but now an ancient 
monument.The present church is much    
further inland, rebuilt because the    
sea was gradually eating away at the   
land.Bishopstone Manor is so called    
because it once belonged to the        
Archbishp of Canterbury. Today it is   
surrounded by modern housing, most of  
it built in the last twenty years.The  
inhabitants are mostly newcomerss to   
area.
