		<title>14HINCKLEY - TYPICAL STREET</title>
		<content> Seaforth Drive is a big road with lots
 of houses. We counted 30 houses on the
 left hand side and 34 on the right. It
 took us 5 mins and 30 seconds going   
 down Seaforth Drive and 5 mins and 45 
 seconds going up. Seaforth Drive is on
 a hill. Most of the houses were made  
 of bricks and tiles. On Seaforth Drive
 number 99 was called Timbucktoo. On   
 the corner of Seaforth Drive is number
 101. We asked the owner how old the   
 house was and it was 12 years old. We 
 saw 20 cars and 11 vans. We also saw 6
 lamposts and 14 signs. There were 54  
 semi-detached houses. Nearly all the  
 houses had wood cladding between the  
 windows. Seaforth Drive is a typical  
 Hinckley estate road.
