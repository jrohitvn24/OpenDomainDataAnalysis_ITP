		<title>20ENTERTAINMENTS</title>
		<content> IN this rural area there are only     
 limited entertainment facilities.{THE 
{CROWN}at Staplehay is the main public 
 House.In the east of the area lies    
{Taunton Racecourse,}where horse racing
 takes place infrequently(4-6 times a  
 year).The race course is also the     
 venue for an annual{Fun Day}at which a
 number of events such as demonstration
  of police dogs,or motor bike stunts  
 take place along with many stalls     
 where children can be made up as      
 clowns or punks for example.          
{Gatchell House}is a private sports    
 club for squash players of some merit 
 drawing players from all over the     
 area.The Somerset Area Police Training
 Centre at Canonsgrove also arrange the
 occasional dances.                    
 No doubt if Trull and the southern    
 part of Taunton near Fullands continue
 to expand,facilities will increase.   </content>
