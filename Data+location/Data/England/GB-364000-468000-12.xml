		<title>12TRAFFIC IN BENTHAM</title>
		<content> We compared traffic in Bentham on a   
 market day with a quiet day           
 (Thursday). Surprisingly there were   
 less cars in the town centre on a     
 Wednesday (296 as compared with 393), 
 and fewer lorries (84 to 104). We     
 think motorists avoid the town centre 
 because of congestion. The only       
 category to increase on a market day  
 were tractors.{Trains}run daily from  
 Leeds to Morecambe. 5 stop on a       
 weekday and 3 on a Sunday on the down 
 line. 6 during the week and 3 on a    
 Sunday on the up line. {Buses.}The    
 Pennine and Ribble Bus Companies run a
 daily service between Lancaster and   
 Skipton.                              
 Lancaster-Skipton 15 daily 5 Sunday   
 Skipton-Lancaster 14 daily 5 Sunday
