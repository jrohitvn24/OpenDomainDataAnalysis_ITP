 Whitchurch is quite a busy place.On   
 any day of the week you will always   
 see lots of traffic in the town       
 centre,with traffic passing through   
 the town on it's way to somewhere     
 else or people coming to do their     
 shopping.                             
   It is not so busy now the by-pass   
 takes a lot of the traffic around the 
 town.When there was no by-pass then   
 all the traffic from Southampton to   
 the North had to come through the town
 and there were very many traffic      
 jams,especially when they had to try  
 to get through the centre of the town 
 where the roads meet.                 
   We did a survey of the traffic      
 passing through the town centre to    
 seewhich roads were the busiest and   
 our results are on the next page of   
 text.                                 </content>
