		<title>10WATER MAIN, CUCKFIELD RURAL</title>
		<content>                                       
 This year the Mid Sussex Water Company
 has had a new water main laid from    
 Pilstye Farm to Butlers Green         
 Resevoir, Haywards Heath. The land was
 surveyed by M.J.Zara Associates of    
 Lewes. This trunk main will eventually
 be joined to the Ardingly Resevoir. R.
 E. Docwra of Hatfield, Middlesex, the 
 company employed on the work is the   
 oldest mains laying contractors in the
 country. Twelve of their men took four
 months to lay the 5km of 400mm ductile
 lined pressure main. The cost of the  
 operation was Â£350,000. A pumping     
 station is to be built at Pilstye Farm
 and water will be pumped either way   
 along the main to boost the water     
 pressure where it is most needed.
