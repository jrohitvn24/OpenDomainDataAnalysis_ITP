 Most of our area was sea.This is the  
{Bristol Channel,}the estuary of the   
 River Severn.At low tide there are mud
 banks.In the river there were buoys.We
 could all see Denny Island.Across the 
 other side we could see  South Wales. 
 Two squares were part of              
{Portishead.}The  area was Battery     
 Point.There was an old power station  
 which has now closed down.
