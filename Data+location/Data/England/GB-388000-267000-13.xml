		<content> Although almost every household puts  
 television first on the list, this is 
 by no means the sole leisure activity.
 Next in popularity is gardening and   
 about half those surveyed do their own
 decorating and home maintenance. Only 
 eleven people play a musical          
 instrument but many more enjoy        
 theatre, cinema, opera, ballet, art   
 galleries and museums. Most households
 have at least one member in a club or 
 society. These include all types of   
 sports clubs, racing pigeons, pony    
 club, archaeology, local history,     
 Rotary and the National Trust. A few  
 are members of local and voluntary    
 groups such as PCC, WRVS, Friends of  
 the Church, and Hospital Visitors.    
 Most enjoy eating out at Pubs or      
 Restaurants. Only one person has a    
 computer and most people have a       
 variety of active hobbies.            </content>
