		<title>15THE OLD RAILWAY</title>
		<content> The South Brent - Kingsbridge branch  
 line was opened in December 1893. It  
 was a great event in the area, all the
 Loddiswell schoolchildren had a day's 
 holiday and a free tea.               
 The coming of the railway opened up   
 the area with easy access from        
 Woodleigh and Loddiswell to           
 Kingsbridge, Plymouth, Exeter and even
 London. In some ways travel in and out
 of the area was easier then than it is
 now. In 1893 one could leave London at
 9am and be at Loddiswell Station at   
 4.33pm - in time for tea!             
 During the 1950's passenger traffic   
 declined, and in September 1963 the   
 line was closed. The track was soon   
 taken up and sold as scrap, and the   
 line is now only a quiet footpath and 
 farm track, very overgrown in places. 
 A great tourist opportunity to keep   
 the line open for steam was missed.   </content>
