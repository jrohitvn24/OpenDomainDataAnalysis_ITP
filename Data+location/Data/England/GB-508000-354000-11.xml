		<content> The Church is the oldest building in  
 Digby.  It has a Norman arch at the   
 south door dated 11OO A.D.  The       
 chancel screen is said to come from   
 Catley Abbey.  Catley Abbey was sited 
 in Digby Fen.  It was a priory with   
 sixty nuns and monks.  During the 14th
 and 15th centuries Digby Church was   
 enlarged and the roof was raised and  
 covered with slates.  Formerly it was 
 thatch.                               
 Most of the church is Early English,  
 but the clerestory, pinnacle tower and
 crocketed spire are Perpendicular.    
 The pulpit is Jacobean.  There is late
 seventeenth century work with a fine  
 array of bench ends.  Other features  
 include a cross and a beehive shaped  
 well cover.
