		<title>01SHIREBROOK ATHLETIC CLUB.</title>
		<content>  Every Tuesday at 6.00 p.m.eager young
 athletes gather together in the gym at
 Shirebrook Comprehesive to run relays 
 and races .It costs 25p to get in then
 when we've paid we play Football or   
 benchball Then we get four teams to   
 practice our relays. We have one team 
 at a time round the track four times  
 against the clock.Then we go back in  
 to the gym to do the high jump .After 
 we play crab football, then we do     
 races against each other,after which  
 we have  a choice of activity .Most   
 weeks we choose to play tiggy because 
 we like it better than football.We    
 test the effectivness of our training 
 when we compete against athletes from 
 other clubs at meetings held every    
 month.Shirebrook Athletic Club compare
 favourably with the standards reached 
 by others in the area and hope  one   
 day to  become the area champions.    </content>
