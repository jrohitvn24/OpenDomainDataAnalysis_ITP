		<content> Devon is a very old county with many  
 ancient villages and towns. Many      
 villages have haunted houses. In      
 Stokeinteignhead, Rock Cottage, Higher
 Farm and Gabwell Farm are reputed to  
 be haunted. The Combe Cellers Inn at  
 Combeinteignhead is also said to be   
 haunted. At 12noon at Rock Cottage    
 banging noises are heard on the stairs
 but no one is ever there. In a room at
 the Combe Cellers Inn there is a      
 distinctive smell of roses even when  
 there are no roses anywhere near the  
 room.                                 
 Many local people are superstitious.  
 We conducted our own survey among     
 local people and the results are on   
 the next page.
