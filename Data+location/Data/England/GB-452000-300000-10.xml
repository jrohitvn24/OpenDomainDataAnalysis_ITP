		<title>10SHAKESPEARE PUB</title>
		<content> This pub is on Braunstone Lane, and   
 was built in 1655 as a farm house and 
 it became a public house in 1955.     
 Opening times - 1100 - 1430           
            and  1800 - 2300           
 Mild, bitter and lager beers were sold
 and the pub has got a darts team.     
 16 people work in the pub but some of 
 these are part-time and work only when
 the pub is open.                      
 The landlord buys the beer from the   
 Everards brewery. Children who spoke  
 to the landlord asked if children were
 normally allowed in the pub. The      
 answer was no, but there was a games  
 room where children could play and    
 have soft drinks.                     
 People can have meals at lunchtimes   
 and the  pub can also cater for       
 wedding and other parties. The        
 thatched roof costs Â£30,000 to        
 repair.                               </content>
