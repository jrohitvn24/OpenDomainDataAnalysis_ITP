		<title>09Footpaths in Stambourne</title>
		<content> Many public footpaths are shown on    
 the Ordnance Survey map in the        
 Stambourne and Toppesfield area. We   
 went out to look for them but a lot   
 were not there because nobody has     
 walked on them for many years. Those  
 we found were marked at each end by a 
 concrete "Public Footpath" sign but   
 it was sometimes difficult to find    
 exactly where they went.Some paths are
 ploughed up and hedges which may once 
 have bordered paths have occasionally 
 been removed.Footpaths near to the    
 centre of the villages are regularly  
 used by local residents, especially   
 people out exercising their dogs.A    
 group of people in Toppesfield have   
 formed a society to preserve          
 footpaths.They have identified several
 little-used footpaths and have walked 
 them to confirm their existence.
