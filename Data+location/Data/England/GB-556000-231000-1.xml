		<content>      This area of{Essex}is composed of
 parts of the parishes of Debden,      
 Debden Green, Hamperden End, Cutlers  
 Green and Wimbish. It is mainly       
{farmland}although some 85 hectares are
{woodland}managed by the Forestry      
 Commission. Most of the housing is old
 mainly{thatched cottages.}There is one
 general store and Post Office together
 with a garage at Debden Green, but no 
 other shops. Most of the people shop  
 in the local town of{Saffron Walden}or
 in Bishop's Stortford or Cambridge.   
      The majority of working people do
 in fact work in Saffron Walden or the 
 surrounding villages. However a fair  
 proportion{commute}to either London or
 Cambridge. Manual jobs such as        
{building and decorating}employ several
 people but very few people work on the
 land due to the highly mechanised     
 nature of{farming.                    </content>
