		<title>05FARMING Local Changes (2)</title>
		<content> During the Second World War farms were
 encouraged and after the war the      
 Government poured money into them.    
 Farms were expanded and much food was 
 produced.Bigger machines were used so 
 fewer people were needed. Farm        
 cottages became weekend or holiday    
 homes for towspeople.Others moved     
 into the village but worked in the    
 cities. Today farms are reducing their
 produce.Big farms specialize whilst   
 small farms turn to other things.     
  Sharlands a farm 60 to 70 years      
 old,was a mixed farm with cattle,but  
 now they produce"Pick Your Own Fruit",
 have a pottery,run painting classes   
 and have a swimming pool open to the  
 public. At Brownings Farm the barns   
 have been taken over as craft shops:  
 there is a pottery,picture framing and
 weaving. An ornamental blacksmith now 
 works in the old milking parlour.     </content>
