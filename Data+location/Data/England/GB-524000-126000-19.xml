		<title>19A DAIRY FARM _ STAPLEFIELD</title>
		<content> The 200 cows (mostly Friesian) at Hill
 House Farm are milked daily and       
 produce  4000 gallons of milk a       
 day.The farmer breeds calves. He sells
 some privately and keeps some. He uses
 a lot of machinery, mainly for        
 milking,feeding cows and cutting the  
 grass. The farm covers 350 acres. The 
 Farmer owns 150 acres, the National   
 Trust the rest. There are four houses 
 on the farm. The large farmhouse was  
 on exhibition at Crystal Palace in    
 1851. People do not like the farmer   
 using pesticides as they can pollute  
 the water. This farmer thought that   
 the only advantage of modern          
 technology was a reduction in labour. 
 20 yrs ago 4 men would have milked 200
 cows today 1 man is needed. There are 
 2 workers on this farm, the farmer's  
 son and a herdsman. The farmer is     
 also a builder.                       </content>
