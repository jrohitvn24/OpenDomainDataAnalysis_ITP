<title>21Cheadle to the D Road</title>
<content>

My late father and myself were drivers for Blue Circle and delivered face gravel from Huntley Wood quarry to the D road, along with sand and gravel as required. I remember they struck a coal seam which was close to the surface near to Talke and everything was suspended for a time as it could become inflammable and it had to be removed.&lt;br />&lt;br />I have lived in Western Australia since 1978 and visited UK in 1998. I travelled down the D road one morning and thought, 'What a nice carpark I helped to build.'   &lt;br />
