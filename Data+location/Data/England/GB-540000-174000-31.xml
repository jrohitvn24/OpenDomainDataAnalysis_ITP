Dear Diary,&lt;br />&lt;br />I woke up at 10:00am very tired still, excited about going swimming with Robyn. We couldn’t decide which pool we were going to but we ended up going to Bromley, Pavilion.&lt;br />&lt;br />When we arrived we got dressed in our costumes and went for a swim. I went on both waterslides. &lt;br />&lt;br />After about one and a half hours we went into Bromley and had McDonald’s, then we had a little browse and we came back home for dinner.&lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
