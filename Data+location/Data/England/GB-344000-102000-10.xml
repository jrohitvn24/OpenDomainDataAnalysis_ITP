		<title>10NEWTS AND FROGS</title>
		<content> Newts are creatures that like the     
 running water of Dorsets streams and  
 rivers.They are sometimes are found in
 horse troughs where they can go deep  
 out of the sun.In Dorset we have two  
 of the three English species these    
 are;the common newt or smooth newt and
 palmate newt.                         
  Frogs come from frogspawn which is   
 found in murky pools.Frogs also have  
 homes built in marsh land and pools   
 and same as the newt they have a      
 couple of species in the area the     
 common frog is the most prolific frog 
 in the area.They like small pools and 
 like newts are sometimes found in     
 horse troughs.The others are only a   
 little different and are the common   
 european frog which likes the same    
 habitat.
