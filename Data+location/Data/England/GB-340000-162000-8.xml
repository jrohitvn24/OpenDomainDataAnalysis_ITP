		<content> I live at Pool Farm, Hewish. The      
 oldest part of my house is five       
 hundred years old. My mother runs our 
 house as a hotel so in the Summer when
 all our 17 rooms are taken I sleep in 
 a caravan. In the Summer I am very    
 busy and make lots of friends. I go   
 riding on my pony, Mandi. We have two 
 ponies and two horses. In the Winter I
 don't make so many friends and I can't
 ride because by the time I get home   
 from school it is dark so I read. Our 
 house is situated on the A 370 and we 
 have lanes all around us. I like to   
 ride my horse and my bike down them.
