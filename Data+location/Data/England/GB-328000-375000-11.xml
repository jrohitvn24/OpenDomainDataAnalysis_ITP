		<title>11ST.MICHAEL'S CHURCH NESTON</title>
		<content>            {Religion                  
                                       
    I go to St. Michael's Church which 
 is an offspring of the Parish Church  
 in Neston. It is a Church of England. 
    Every Sunday I go to Sunday School.
 Here we act out plays of what happened
 to Jesus when He was alive, we also   
 read from the Bible and sing.         
 Sometimes our Sunday School teacher   
 reads to us from the Bible. After we  
 have sung, we pray, kneeling on       
 hassocks.                             
    Every month we have a family       
 service when our Mums and Dads come to
 watch. We have communion with a vicar.
 If you have been confirmed you get a  
 piece of bread and a sip of wine. If  
 you are not confirmed you get a       
 blessing from the vicar.
