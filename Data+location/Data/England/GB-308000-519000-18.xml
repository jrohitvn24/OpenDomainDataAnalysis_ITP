		<title>18WALKING STICKS LAMPLUGH</title>
		<content> Making walking sticks is a Lakeland   
 craft. Cyril Tyson has been making    
 walking sticks for 53 years. His dad  
 taught him the craft when he was 8.   
 The wood has to dry out for 3 years   
 which includes leaving it on a flat   
 board and turning it to straighten it.
 The handles are made of Deer horn, Ram
 horn, Buffalo horn, Cow horn, Deer    
 foot and Wood. The horns have to be   
 boiled before they can be bent into   
 shape. Each stick takes about 100     
 hours to make (Not including finding  
 and drying the wood). The cost        
 of the sticks is: Deer horn Â£12       
 Buffalo horn Â£70 and ornamental       
 sticks are Â£100. Deer horn before it  
 is made into a stick costs Â£3.50 per  
 100g. Cyril Tyson gives quite a lot of
 his sticks as prizes for raffles.
