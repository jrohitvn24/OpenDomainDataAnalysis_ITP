		<content> We did an electrical and gas appliance
 survey. Out of the whole class we     
 found that nearly everybody had a     
 colour TV and everybody had a         
 telephone.                            
 Nobody had an electric toothbrush, and
 very few people had electric blankets 
 or Teasmades.                         
 Only five people had a hedge cutter,  
 strimmer and a liquidiser.            
 Most people had a freezer, clock, hair
 dryer, kettle, cooker,iron and a      
 radio.                                
 Our gas survey shows that many people 
 had gas central heating. Eight people 
 had gas stoves, ten people had gas    
 fires and boilers . Nobody had a gas  
 fridge.
