		<title>17RAILWAY CELEBRATIONS SWANAGE</title>
		<content> 11.00am - 12.30pm - Re-Enactment of   
                 the opening at Swanage
                 station. Costume      
                 competition follows.  
   It was raining on the Monday so the 
 carriages were not used. The other    
 events went as planned and some of    
 the children from our school dressed  
 in Edwardian costume, but they didn't 
 win a prize. There were rides on the  
 train and a postman stamped First Day 
 Covers to celebrate the centenary.    
 Reproductions of the "Poole and       
 Bournemouth Herald" newspaper of      
 21st May 1885 were being sold. In it  
 was an article about the opening of   
 the Swanage - Wareham line. It        
 described how, when the first train   
 approached Swanage, crowds of people  
 began cheering and waving their hats.
