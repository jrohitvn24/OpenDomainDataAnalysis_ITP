		<content>    Agriculture predominates in this   
 area.Most farms are relatively small  
 family farms.Although about 90% of the
 land is owner occupied,some 10% is    
 rented,mainly by new entrants into    
 farming.All the full-time farms have  
 livestock enterprises.There are about 
 2000 sheep,800 beef animals,330 dairy 
 cows and followers.There is only one  
 commercial laying poultry flock and   
 one broiler chicken unit.There are a  
 few dozen milking goats and a similar 
 number of riding horses.              
    It is significant that 5 of the 11 
 full-time farmers supplement their in-
 come with paying summer guests.       
    Because much of the land is very   
 steep or wet(old moors) harvesting of 
 crops is impossible on much of this   
 area,high rainfall(>50"), fairly high 
 altitude(600-800')dictate the practice
 of grassland not  arable farming.     </content>
