 90% of households have a telephone and
 there are 4 public telephone boxes.   
 There are 4 post boxes which are emp- 
 tied twice daily and post is delivered
 twice daily except on Sundays.

 The Mobile Library visits Worth and   
 Finglesham once a week.

 The area is policed by the Thanet Div-
 ision Kent Police. The station at Bur-
 gess Green has been closed about a    
 year but was used during the 1984-5   
 pit strike to house visiting police-  
 men. The cover is adequate as there is
 little or no crime or vandalism, but  
 most people would like to see the     
 'Village Bobby' back again in the     
 community.                            </content>
