 area is privately owned.The only{     
{council house}is the School House     
 attached to Salesbury School,formerly 
 the home of the schoolteacher.        
   In 1985 an ambitious scheme to      
 provide{sheltered housing}for the aged
 and needy of the area was completed at
{Showley Court}off Ribchester Road.    
   The flats and maisonettes have an   
 open outlook with farmland behind and 
 the village green,Salesbury Cricket   
 ground and St.Peter's Church in front.
 With locals,and those who enjoy peace 
 and quiet with the possibility of an  
 excellent hostelry serving good food  
 within 5 minutes walk,Bonney Inn,this 
 development has proved extremely      
 popular.                              
   There are no minority groups in the 
 area,few unemployed,no religious or   
 racial discriminations.A happy valley!</content>
