		<content> A very important factor in the        
 development of the area is its        
 proximity to the sea and this has now 
 been recognised by the opening of a   
 Maritime Museum on 10.7.85. The museum
 is housed in the old Custom House on  
 St.George's Quay. The quay was vital  
 to early trade particularly with the  
 West Indies and this resulted in the  
 Custom House being built in 1764.After
 the decline of Lancaster as a port the
 quay fell into disrepair but is now   
 being restored and is becoming a      
 popular tourist attraction. 1000      
 people visited the museum in its first
 5 days. As well as displaying the     
 history of trade with the W.Indies it 
 also gives valuable insight into the  
 fishing industry of the area.2 period 
 rooms are in the museum, one showing  
 an (18 Custom Office another a (20    
 Morecambe Bay cottage kitchen.        </content>
