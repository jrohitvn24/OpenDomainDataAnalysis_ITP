		<title>20A DAY IN MY LIFE - PIERS</title>
		<content> On Thursday, 4th July, I woke up and  
 remembered it was Sports day. I got   
 dressed, had breakfast and went to    
 school. We worked in the morning and  
 practised the relay to see who would  
 be in it.  After dinner we watched the
 Obstacle race heats. When the sports  
 started our first race was Ball and   
 spoon. I came first for Adhurst (my   
 team). I came nowhere in the next     
 race, but I was 3rd in the shuttle and
 3rd in the 60 metres. At the end the  
 shield was presented to Stoner, the   
 winning team. After that there were   
 some speeches, and cards and presents 
 were given to our Headmaster because  
 he is retiring this term. The parents 
 put on a tea party for us all. When I 
 got home Dad had come back from Egypt 
 and he showed me his new car. Just    
 before supper he gave me a racing car 
 game and I played before going to bed.</content>
