		<title>10VISIT TO WORTH SCHOOL</title>
		<content> A dozen 12 year old's from{St.Andrews{
 visited{Worth School in June 1985.}   
 The main difference between our       
 schools is that you don't see your    
 parents much.The{monks}are just like  
 normal teachers. Many of the boys     
 prefer their school to a state school,
 but they miss the{girls.}Supper &amp;     
 breakfast seem to be their best meal. 
 Naughty boys are sent to the{Matron   
 for{punishment.}If you walked past a  
 monk you have to say "Good morning    
 Father". You do not have much{privacy 
 in the shower &amp; changing rooms.The    
 shower room is big with taps all      
 around the walls.In their dormatories 
 they have their own duvets from home. 
 We arrived thinking they were posh,   
 but we were wrong.The lessons are from
{9.00}to{12.00}&amp; in the late afternoon.
 Inbetween they have games from{1.00   
 till{2.00.                            </content>
