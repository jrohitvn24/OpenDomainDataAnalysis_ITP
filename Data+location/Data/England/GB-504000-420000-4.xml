		<title>04PARISH COUNCIL (2)</title>
		<content>  It is frequently the body expected to
 take a lead within the community on   
 projects for the benefit of the       
 community, but is not necessarily     
 expected to carry out the project     
 itself but to give a lead in bringing 
 people together for the purpose.This  
 is a natural role as often the Parish 
 Council is the only body with initial 
 access to information and with the    
 resources to take on initiative.      
 A Parish Council has the power to     
 report to other authorities for the   
 repairs of roads, footpaths, street   
 lights etc: and the power to provide  
 seats or shelters or flowers, trees   
 providing they are not on private     
 land. War Memorials, Church Clocks and
 cemeteries can also come under the    
 powers of a Parish Council.
