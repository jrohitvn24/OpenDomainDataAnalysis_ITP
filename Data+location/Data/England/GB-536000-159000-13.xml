 In 1955 the quiet derelict Thatched   
Cottage which is situated in the heart 
of the countryside was bought by Mr    
and Mrs Bailey.The price was as low as 
two thousand pounds.As it was so       
empty, the birds had called it their   
home.The two  acres of overgrown  land 
needed alot of care and hard work to   
it. When the house was first bought by 
the family  (as they had two children  
as well) it only had two upstairs      
rooms and only two downstairs          
rooms.But one of their sons became     
an architect,so in later times they    
had some more downstairs rooms built   
on.The original  two downstairs rooms  
were a kitchen which had very thick    
beams and was very low down.The other  
original downstairs  room was a living 
room there was a very big fire         
place.It even had a little seat inside </content>
