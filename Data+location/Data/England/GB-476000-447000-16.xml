 This is a very versatile area,        
 field crops include Wheat, Barley,    
 Oats &amp; Rye. Root crops- Potatoes,     
 Carrots, Cabbage, Turnip, Sugar Beet, 
 &amp; Swede. There is also grazing land   
 for cattle (meat) not milking, and    
 sheep. The farms hve been in most     
 cases passed down from father to son, 
 or when the acreage is large from     
 father to sons. The buildings are in a
 good state of repair. The farm houses 
 outwardly seem little changed, not so 
 the interiors these have in most cases
 been modernised and made much more    
 comfortble. Farmimg is done be        
 machinery, combines, and tractors are 
 a common sight.Electrified Fences are 
 used to confine stock. Dogs serve as  
 pets and guard-dogs. A few Jacob Sheep
 are to be seen, the fleece being very 
 popular with the ladies who spin.     </content>
