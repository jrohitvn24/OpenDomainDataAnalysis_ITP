		<content>    On Friday 7th June we went across  
 the county boundary from Essex to     
 Suffolk.We went to Bures school where 
 we interviewed the children.          
    The school is a Victorian building 
 with a caravan classroom.They also    
 have a swimming pool for learners so, 
 during the summer,the children go     
 swimming each day.                    
    The school is a first school       
 because it is in Suffolk and the      
 oldest children are only nine.        
    They have to cross the road to the 
 recreation field opposite for         
 sports.Although they have no school   
 hall the classrooms are very big but  
 when they need more space they have to
 use the village hall.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
