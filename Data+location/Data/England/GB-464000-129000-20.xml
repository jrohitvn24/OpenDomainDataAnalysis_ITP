		<title>20Ropley Domesday Compilers</title>
		<content> The study of the area for this        
 Domesday project was carried out      
 mainly by the 3rd and 4th year        
 children of Ropley School with the    
 help of parents and residents.Only a  
 small number of the children actually 
 live within the D-block as a large    
 part of the village of Ropley lies    
 outside the study area.When we started
 the study we found that many of us did
 not know our block very well and we   
 discovered a great deal about the area
 from our Domesday study.We started by 
 studying different scale maps of the  
 area and maps of different dates to   
 see what things had changed.We went   
 out all over the area - by car for    
 general surveys and on foot for more  
 detailed information.We talked to old 
 residents of the area and to people   
 who were newcomers.We ran out of time 
 at the end and it was a rush to finish</content>
