		<content>    In our study area there is a house 
 called Balsams. Balsam is a medicinal 
 herb and was grown along with other   
 herbs in the fields owned by The      
 Knights Hospitallers of St.John.This  
 group were Crusader Knights who fought
 in The Holy Land. Their sign was a    
 Maltese cross, which today is used by 
 the St.John's Ambulance Brigade. The  
 commander of the Order of the Knights 
 Hospitallers lived where Standon      
 Friars is now.                        
   On one of our walks around the      
 village in late June  and July we     
 noticed wild balsam growing in        
 abundance on Oudle Lane.We took some  
 of the flowers back to school to      
 examine them more closely.It belongs  
 to the genus of plants Impatiens and  
 has hooded and spurred coloured sepals
 and thick succulent stems.
