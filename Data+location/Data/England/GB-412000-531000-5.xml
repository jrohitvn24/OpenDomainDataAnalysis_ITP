		<content> They have a dog called Shelly and a   
 couple of cats. One of her horses has 
 a bad throat and another has a bad    
 foot.Sometimes she uses the horses for
 working. She mucks the stables out    
 every day. Miss Wakefield's favourite 
 horse is called Ralph. The colour of  
 the 2 horses that she rides are black 
 and chestnut. Not all of her horses   
 wear horse shoes only the ones that   
 work.{Her most expensive horse was    
{about Â£2000}or more but she is not    
 sure. Miss Wakefield likes to ride    
 them every day to exercise them.
