		<title>10CLAPHAMS WOOD</title>
		<content> This is  a{sloping hillside}area.Most 
 of the land is{farmed}and it belongs  
 to{Barnaby Side Farm.}The path which  
 we followed was a{broad track}which   
 in used by the farmer when he goes to 
 the fields in his tractor.Some of the 
 fields contain{winter sown barley     
 which is almost ready for harvesting. 
 Other fields have{spring sown barley  
 which will be ready for harvest in the
 autumn.There was a small area of      
{evergreen tree.}There was a wood which
 was mostly{deciduous,}it was called   
{Claphams Wood.}We also saw a large    
 black barn full of straw.A{dry stone  
{wall}ran along the edge of the wood to
 seperate it from the fields.Most of   
 the fields had{wire fencing}or{hedges.
 Some of the fields just had grass in  
 them.In other fields there were{pigs. 
 The pigs were{crossbred saddleback .
