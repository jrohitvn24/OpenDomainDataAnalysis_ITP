		<title>11INSIDE GOLDHANGER SCHOOL</title>
		<content>  When the school was  a school there  
 were two classrooms.In the classrooms 
 they had high windows so the children 
 could not look out. They had metal    
 bars in the classrooms that hung from 
 the ceiling.On the metal bars there   
 was a little hook where gas lights    
 hung.                                 
    As the school is now used as an    
 outdoor education field study centre  
 the classrooms have different uses    
 today.One of the classrooms is used   
 for students to sleep in.They sleep in
 bunkbeds.The other classroom is used  
 for students to work in.They have got 
 a kitchen which they don't use because
 they have got a new building which has
 got a kitchen and a diningroom in.    
 There are toilets which are still used
 as toilets.There is an office which is
 now used as a cloakroom.
