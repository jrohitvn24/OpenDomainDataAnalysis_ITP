 house front in Britain. It is in the  
 Guinness Book of Records.The{East

{Front.}The architect was{Henry        
{Flitcroft}and the work took many years
 to finish. The house was built in the 
{Palladian}style. Inside the house the 
 rooms are very richly decorated. The  
{Whistlejacket Room}is named after a   
{racehorse}owned by the{2nd. Marquess. 
 There used to be a painting of the    
 horse in the room.{Sheffield City
