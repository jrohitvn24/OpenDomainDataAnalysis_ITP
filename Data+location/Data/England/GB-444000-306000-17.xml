		<content>   The Cross Hills Chapel lies between 
 Thornton and Bagworth .It was built   
 in 1885,it will seat 300 people.This  
 year is its centenary.There will be a 
 procession of witness to the chapel,as
 was done in 1885 at the opening.A man 
 named Sammuel Deacan took  services on
 open ground and then in cottages.In   
 the 1920s,the chapel was so packed    
 people sat on the banks across the    
 road to listen to the service.Today   
 only 12 adults and 10 children attend.
 The church building is suffering      
 severely today from mining subsidence 
 and is in need of repair.
