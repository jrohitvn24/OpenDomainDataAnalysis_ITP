		<content> Our favourite game is cricket which   
 you play with special equipment,      
 stumps,bails,bat and ball.The         
 positions are bowler, batter, wicket  
 keeper and fielders.The bowler bowls  
 the ball aiming to hit the wickets or 
 the leg to get L.B.W.which means leg  
 before wicket.There is a keen         
 interest.In the village we have our   
 own cricket field plus another club   
 three miles away.                     
 At school besides cricket we play     
 rounders, football and the girls play 
 netball but in the village itself     
 cricket is the only organised game.   
 A game our grandparents played is Tip 
 Cap, a game played with 2 sticks.One 6
 inches sharpened at each end.The other
 was 2 foot long.You struck the pointed
 end of the stick lying in the circle. 
 When in the air you knocked it so it  
 did not land back in the circle.      </content>
