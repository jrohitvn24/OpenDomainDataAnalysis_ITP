 One of my favourite hobbies is model  
 making.With my pocket money I buy kits
 which are scale replicas of military  
 vehicles.These I make up and design   
 and make scale scenes for the models  
 with my dad.                          
 Another hobby is collecting Post      
 Office 1st.Day Covers.My grandad sends
 these to me every time new stamps come
 out.                                  
 I also like drawing .I play football  
 for the school.                       
 Since dad gave me his old camera I    
 have started to take pictures and am  
 starting a collection of car pictures.
 I got some good ones in France when I 
 went on holiday.                      
 I also have a computer which I play   
 games on.
