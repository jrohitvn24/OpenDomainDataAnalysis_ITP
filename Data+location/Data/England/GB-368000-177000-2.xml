		<title>02A FAVOURITE LOCAL WALK</title>
		<content>  From our Yate school we can walk into
 the survey area.We leave our houses   
 behind,cross the railway line and     
 reach Wapley Common.We can see that   
 most of the area is farmland and      
 Wapley church looks very pretty on top
 of the hill.Walking up the quiet lane 
 we can see horses,sheep and cows in   
 the fields.The houses and church have 
 different tiles, some stone, others   
 slate or pottery. The church has a    
 metal footscrape and steel support in 
 its tower.It is lovely to sit in the  
 shade of the trees in the churchyard. 
 Touching the church walls and closing 
 our eyes it feels all rough like      
 sandpaper.Nearby is the old school    
 house and a disused water pump in the 
 field.It is a lovely walk from Yate to
 Wapley and many of us go there with   
 family or friends.
