		<title>04SMUGGLERS INN AT ST.ERTH</title>
		<content> The old part of the pub dates back to 
 the 16th century.It is a protected    
 building which means it can't be      
 altered.It was added to in the 18th   
 century and the new part of the pub is
{5}years old.                          
 The Smugglers was originally called   
 the Calais because the road outside is
 called Calais Road.Then the name was  
 changed to the Victoria Inn. It is now
 called the Smugglers because of the   
 smuggling family once said to have    
 lived there.                          
 The Carter family were great          
 smugglers.Legend says one of them was 
 hung in the front room. There is a    
 mysterious presence in the pub and the
 owner has seen a{black shape}pass     
 through a closed door.                
 On another occasion a glass was seen  
 to jump from a shelf and bounce across
 the bar.                              </content>
