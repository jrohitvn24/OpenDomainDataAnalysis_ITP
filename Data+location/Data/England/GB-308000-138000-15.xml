		<content>      There are many interesting       
{Prehistoric Sites}on the Quantock     
 Hills and there is one particularly   
 interesting one just behind the       
 village of Bicknoller.    It is called
{Trendle Ring}and as its name would    
 suggest it is a circular enclosure. It
 covers nearly a hectare and is        
 delightfully situated on a spur of    
{Bicknoller Hill.  }It is almost       
 impossible to see from above and      
 although more easily detected from the
 Village below its excellent defensive 
 position can be appreciated.   The    
 entrance to this earthwork is to be   
 found in the North Eastern corner and 
 suprisingly a modern footpath still   
 runs through this entrance.           
      In Prehistoric times it would    
 have been used for people to live in  
 and to keep their livestock near them.
