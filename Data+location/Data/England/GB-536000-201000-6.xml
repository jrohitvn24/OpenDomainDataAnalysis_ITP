		<title>06The Lea Navigation</title>
		<content>In the past the Lea Navigation was used
to take raw materials like timber from 
towns to the north of London into its  
centre.The materials were carried by   
barges and these were pulled by horses 
which walked along the towpath which   
runs alongside the canal.Today the     
canal is used for fishing and pleasure 
cruising.Fishing is very popular       
because there are many types of fish in
the canal.The canal isnÂ£t used for     
carrying raw materials today.This is   
because the barges have been outdated  
by lorries,vans and trains.The towpaths
are now used for people to walk on and 
are also used by fishermen to sit on.  
The canal is 28 miles long running     
through the Lea Valley and finishing in
the Thames at Blackwall,south of the   
Isle of Dogs.
