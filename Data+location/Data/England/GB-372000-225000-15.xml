		<title>15A school-child's average day</title>
		<content> I wake up at 7.30 to the sound of my  
 alarm clock, dress in my school       
 clothes and have breakfast of cereal, 
 toast and coffee. I pack my bag and   
 set off for school at 8.35 and meet a 
 friend and we walk to school together.
 It opens at 8.50 and the teacher blows
 a whistle and we go to our classroom. 
 We start with the attendance register 
 and then school assembly and morning  
 work is maths, english,reading lab or 
 mental arithmetic we write our work   
 in an exercise book with felt tip pen.
 At 12.00 we have lunch in the hall and
 then play until 1.15, tag games are my
 favourite. In the afternoon we do     
 science, art or social studies, I like
 painting best. We go home at 3.30 and 
 I have a little snack and then go out 
 to play until 5.00 then I have tea,   
 watch children's t.v. do my piano     
 practice and go to bed at 8.30p.m.    </content>
