		<title>11FARMING</title>
		<content> Most farmers in Chardstock are Dairy  
 Farmers.Some but very few are Beef    
 farmers.Much of the land in Chardstock
 is used by the farmers for their      
 cattle.Crops grown on farms include-  
 hay,silage,maize,wheat,barley swedes  
 and potatoes.Through the years        
 machinery has changed,todays milking  
 is done by machines long ago it was   
 done by hand and took a long time,now 
 it takes less time.Harvesting machines
 are now drawn by Tractors and not     
 pulled by horses.Many years ago crops 
 were sown by hand now it is done by   
 machines,and fields are ploughed by   
 machines too.In Chardstock there are  
 roughly 12 small farmers with approx  
 80 acres some owned some rented.In the
 Winter cows sleep in cubicals with Hay
 for feed and straw for bedding.In late
 spring early summer farmers cut grass 
 for Hay and silage &amp; store it in pits.</content>
