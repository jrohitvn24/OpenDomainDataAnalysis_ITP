		<content>     My name is Dionne Jude. I am      
 eleven. I was born in England. My     
 family come from Dominica, an island  
 in the West Indies. My parents and    
 grandparents come from Dominica.      
     The carnival was started in the   
 West Indies and people from there     
 brought it to Britain. There are many 
 floats each with its own band. In the 
 carnival the best float wins.         
     I was born on the fairy tale      
 float. I was a pearl. My costume was  
 peach coloured. It has pants at the   
 top and a pearl shaped hat, and I had 
 a shell on my back.                   
     We danced to Calypso and Reggae   
 music.
