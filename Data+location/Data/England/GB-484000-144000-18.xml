		<content> was carried out but the site was      
 reopened to the public early in 1985. 
 Today,one can see the remains of the  
 second Abbey church,begun in 1203,most
 notably the West Trancepts,the Chapter
 House,parts of the mid-thirteenth     
 century monks dormitory and the       
 cellarium.                            
 On St. Swithun's day in 1978, a       
 pageant was held in the Abbey grounds 
 to mark the 850th anniversary of the  
 foundation.This was a great spectacle 
 with the local Middle Schools reliving
 the history of Waverley Abbey.        
  In 1974,reorganisation of Local      
 Government in England and Wales led to
 the setting up of a Surrey district   
 covering some 85000 acres comprising  
 the towns of Cranleigh, Farnham,      
 Godalming and Haslemere,and numerous  
 villages. The name{Waverley}was taken 
 for this administrative area.         </content>
