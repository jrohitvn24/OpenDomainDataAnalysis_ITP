		<title>18Trades and Crafts,Stevington</title>
		<content> There is no real factory employment in
 Stevington.However there is a man who 
 builds and repairs organs,harpsichords
 and spinets,often using local grown   
 wood.His workshop is a disused chapel.
 A former barn is now a repair shop for
 washing machines.There is a           
 hairdressing salon in the village and 
 two local farmers are agents for      
 wood-burning and straw burning stoves.
 One hundred years ago there were one  
 hundred and sixty lace makers but now 
 just a few senior citizens carry on   
 the tradition.A retired resident is   
 rebuilding a 1936 Riley Lynx and      
 another has a collection of invalid   
 carriages,motor-bikes and veteran cars
 which are occasionally shown to the   
 public.Many ladies have taken up      
 canvas embroidery work and have       
 refurnished the church with beautiful 
 hassocks.                             </content>
