		<title>10WORSHIP AT CROPWELL BUTLER</title>
		<content> The Parish Church for the villages of 
 Cropwell Butler, Tithby, and Wiverton 
 Hall is{Holy Trinity Church}at Tithby;
 an Early English building famous for  
 its Georgian furnishings. Cropwell    
 Butler has never has a Parish Church  
 although until recently there was a   
 Victorian Chapel-of-Ease. The         
{Methodist Chapel}has now become the   
 Church of Cropwell Butler, shared by  
 both Anglicans and Methodists, and the
 evening services are alternately Even-
 song and Methodist Evening worship;   
 with substantially the same           
 congregation. Morning services are at 
 Tithby, always Anglican, but a few    
 Methodists attend Morning Prayer, so  
 although the arrangement is still     
 informal, there is a high degree of   
 unity in the Church of this parish.
