		<content> The Mendip Hills play host to a wide  
 variety of widlife. In Stockhill      
 Forest   deer can be found, especially
 if you go there early in the morning. 
 The forest and the surrounding        
 heathland is also the home for adders.
 Badgers,foxes and rabbits can  be     
 found in profusion but not many       
 squirrels.                            
 There is a great range of birds to be 
 seen. Woodpeckers can be heard at work
 in the forest while hawks swoop and   
 hover over the heaths.                
 One small creature has become a local 
 delicacy, the snail. One local        
 restaurant serves them as a           
 speciality.                           
 A wide range of pond life can be found
 in Priddy Pools. These are pools which
 remain from the lead mining operations
 in the area.                          
                                       </content>
