		<content>   {I.C.I. own the majority of our     
{block,}but not all of this is used for
 the quarrying of Limestone.{Tunstead  
{is the largest Limestone quarry in    
{Europe.}I.C.I. also own a railway     
 which runs through Tunstead and is    
 only used for carrying Limestone.     
    The river Wye runs through our     
 block, and as it flows through a      
 gorge it is followed part of the way  
 by{Peak Railway}which uses tunnels and
 cuttings cross the river. There is    
 another small quarry which is owned by
 "TARMAC".                             
    There are{two villages}in the      
 vicinity. Their size has been reduced 
 over the years and now, Cowdale and   
 King Sterndale{are no more, than      
{hamlets}and have no shops.            
    There are also a number of{Farms}in
 our block. The Peak District National 
 Park also runs through our block.     </content>
