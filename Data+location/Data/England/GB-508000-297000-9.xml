		<title>09STIBBINGTON'S FORMER SCHOOL</title>
		<content>  Stibbington's village school, which  
 was opened in 1872 was closed in 1981 
 due to falling numbers.  The village  
 children now have to travel to school 
 in Elton, eight kilometers away.  Most
 villagers disagreed with the school   
 closure and would like to see the     
 school re-opened. One resident though 
 expressed a positive view that        
 "perhaps a wider and broader education
 was available at Elton", a much larger
 school.                               
  Presently the old school building is 
 used as part of the Stibbington Field 
 Study Centre.  It functions as the day
 visitors' centre and is maintained in 
 the style of a 19th century classroom 
 in order to allow visiting students to
 sample school life in Victorian times.
