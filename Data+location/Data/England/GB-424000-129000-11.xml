		<content>    Most old people think that living  
 in the village is interesting,but they
 feel the village needs more           
 entertainment. It is a very friendly  
 place and it has a {Coach Service,    
{Public House,Petrol Station }and a {  
{shop.}There is a recreation ground    
 for the children ,and two schools very
 near by.Some people go to the         
 chapel,but the majority go to {Church.
  Nearly all of the people in the      
 village use the local shop and post   
 office,but they go regulary to {Romsey
 or {Salisbury,}mostly to the {Markets.
  However the younger generation had   
 much different views,for them the     
 village is boring with nothing to do  
 except mess about and they get told   
 off for that.They  all thought that   
 public toilets were needed down at the
 recreation ground.
