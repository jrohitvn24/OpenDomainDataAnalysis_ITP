		<content> In the early{20th Century}the children
 didn't have much time for playing     
 games{"Hoop and stick"}was a very     
 popular game.Some people could not    
 afford to buy the hoop and stick so   
 used the{hoop}off the{barrel}and used 
 a twig from the garden.{"Hopscotch"}  
 was played quite a lot because no     
 special gear was needed.{"Hot ollen"} 
 didn't need any special equipment     
 either.It was{like hide and seek.}Most
 boys played football and cricket.     
 Nowadays people play{games}that need{ 
{batteries}such as{"Simon"}where you   
 have to copy a sequence of colours.   
 Games are more advanced when played on
 a{computer,}such as{Space Invaders}and
 Pac Man.
