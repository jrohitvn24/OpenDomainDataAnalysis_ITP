		<title>20D-I-Y HOUSE BUILDING</title>
		<content> Our family moved here in August 1983. 
 With the intention of building our own
 house. We had been down previously and
 bought a building plot. My Dad and    
 brother had been down in June to site 
 our mobile home and connect it to the 
 electricity, water , sewers and       
 propane gas, there being no mains gas.
 We did not start building until March 
 1984. That summer we got the oversite 
 in, and so far this year we have got  
 up to the first floor windows. We hope
 to have the roof on in six weeks or   
 less. We won't get it plastered out   
 and decorated until next spring. We're
 all looking forward to it, and we'll  
 certainly be pleased to have a bit    
 more room.
