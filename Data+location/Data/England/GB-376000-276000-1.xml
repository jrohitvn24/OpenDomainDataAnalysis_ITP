		<title>01Severn Valley-Trimpley Area</title>
		<content>      The Trimpley and Dowles area of  
 the Severn Valley is an area of great 
 landscape value mostly designated     
 Green Belt.It is divided by the River 
 into 2 halves.To the West is part of  
 Wyre Forest, both a commercial forest 
 and a conservation area, parts being  
 Sites of Special Scientific Interest. 
 To the East is mostly farmland.       
      Much of the housing in the area  
 is expensive commuter housing, workers
 travelling up to 5 miles to local     
 towns or up to 20 miles to the West   
 Midlands Metropolitan Area. Problems  
 common to this type of area are lack  
 of homes for local young families and 
 closure of village schools etc.       
      The area is used by West Midland 
 and local people for many recreational
 activities including fishing, boating 
 and nature walks, and is crossed by   
 the Severn Valley Steam Railway.      </content>
