		<title>07LOCAL AFFAIRS IN DUDLEY (1)</title>
		<content> Dudley Metropolitan Borough has 72    
 councillors;35 Conservative,35 Labour 
 and 2 Independant. Great contrversy   
 was caused when 2 Labour councillors  
 changed parties (becoming Independant)
 thus returning council control to the 
 Tories. The{Lord Mayor}is councillor  
 Kate Rogers.                          
    Dudley runs many public services.  
 Many people seem to think the most    
 important of these is housing;        
 councillors receive many requests for 
 repairs. Dudley plans to erect 1125   
 new dwellings by 1991.                
   An issue of great local interest at 
 present is the {limestone caverns}that
 lie beneath much of the area.Some of  
 these have recently subsided causing  
 Dudley Town football/cricket pitch to 
 be closed. Â£1m Gov't money is to be   
 spent to try to make the caverns safe 
 using a cement &amp; coal waste mixture.  </content>
