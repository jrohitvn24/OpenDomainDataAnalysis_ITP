		<content>             The River Culm has in the 
 past flooded the centre of the village
 but recent improvement work should    
 have removed this hazard without,in   
 any way,spoiling the old bridge.The   
 five stone arches,three of twenty     
 feet and two of sixteen feet reflect  
 the solid timeless feeling of the     
 valley.The Culm provided power as well
 as excellant meadow land for Culmstock
 and although now turned into          
 residential buildings the old mills   
 remain the same from the outside as   
 they have for many years.The same may 
 be said for the old coaching inn and  
 forge.While there is very little      
 evidence to show where the railway    
 once ran the layout of the village and
 its general appearance would probably 
 be easily recognisable to the         
 forefathers of many of the families   
 who still live in the village.        </content>
