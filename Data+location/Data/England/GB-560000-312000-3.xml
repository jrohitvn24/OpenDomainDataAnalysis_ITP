		<title>03River Nar</title>
		<content> The river Nar is a tributary of the   
 Great Ouse. It has a local nickname - 
 the New World. Quite a few people go  
 "rough" camping and fishing there, as 
 it is a quiet and secluded area.

 I went camping with my brother. We got
 chased by a bull. Later we went into  
 an orchard and took some apples. We   
 had baked apples for tea.             
                                       
 The river is quite narrow (3-5m wide) 
 and has dike banks to stop it         
 flooding, or connecting with the farm 
 drainage ditches. There are also flood
 gates which can be manually controlled
 if necessary.                         
                                       
 The river is a haven for birds and    
 wildlife and is flanked by farm       
 fields, mainly growing wheat.         </content>
