		<title>17Hellingly Hospital</title>
		<content>{Hellingly Hospital}is a Victorian     
 building which was opened as the{     
{ East Sussex Lunatic Asylum}in 1904.  
 The hospital is a large building and  
 has a small car park to the right for{
{visitors}and{staff}to park their cars 
 in. The bricks are a dark red colour  
 with cream cement holding them        
 together. The hospital looks          
 uninviting because of its size and    
 shape which seems to swallow you up.  
   The {windows}on the hospital are    
 quite large with white painted window 
 frames. The {shape}of the hospital    
 from above is not regular.It is a very
 small,wide cone shape but it is not a 
 true cone.It is mainly{90 degree right
{angles}getting closer to each other   
 until they touch at the South.The roof
 is not one{ridge}it has many open     
 courtyards all oddly shaped.
