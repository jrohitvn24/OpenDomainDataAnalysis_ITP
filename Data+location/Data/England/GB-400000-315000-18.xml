		<content>  School starts at 08.55, and ends at  
15.15 for Infants, 15.45 for Juniors.  
  The {school day} is divided into 4   
working sessions. 2 are in the morning 
and 2 after dinner. Between each       
session is a break.                    
  The hardest work is usually in       
the morning, following Assembly.       
Often it includes Mathematics and      
some form of English work.             
  In the afternoon we may have work    
like Science, History, Geography,      
Environmental Science, Games, Art and  
Craft, and Religious Education.        
  The {school timetable} has to be     
balanced evenly between all the        
different subjects, and arranged so    
that no two classes are using the      
Television room or Hall together.      
 {After school} there are several clubs
to choose from, such as Dancing, Drama,
Football, Athletics, and Netball.      </content>
