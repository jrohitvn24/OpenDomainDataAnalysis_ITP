		<title>13All Saints Church Kirby Hill</title>
		<content> The church is possibly the most       
 obvious feature in the village.       
 The nave is part Saxon and part Norman
 built with large irregular stones.    
 The site of the church is significant.
 it is on the highest point of the     
 village, and in line with Aldborough  
 and the probable site of the Roman    
 crossing of the River Ure. it may be  
 that the present church is on the site
 of a much earlier sacred shrine dating
 back to the time of the Roman or even 
 Celtic times.                         
 The Parish of Kirby hill is now part  
 of a  wider group of parishes which   
 include Skelton, Norton Le Clay and   
 Cundall. The present incumbent still  
 lives in the Vicarage in Kirby Hill.
