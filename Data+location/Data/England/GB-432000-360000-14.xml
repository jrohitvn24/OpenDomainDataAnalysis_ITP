		<content>   This is a scattered farming         
 community, with not many local notable
 people, but many business people have 
 country residences here. Mrs. Kenning 
 of Kennings Motors lives in the       
 area,also the Misses Bassett of the   
 well-known Bassett's Licquorice       
 Allsorts family. Ted Moult, a         
 successful farmer and radio           
 personality was evacuated to Raven    
 House during the last war, perhaps    
 that led to his affinity for farming  
 later. At Packhorse Farm, a very old  
 building, they supply Bed and         
 Breakfast,as they did for travellers  
 in the olden days, when it was an inn 
 for the saltmen on the Salt Way to    
 Sheffield. The Tomlinsons who run a   
 large dairy farm were very proud to   
 say that their land was mentioned in  
 the original Domesday Book.
