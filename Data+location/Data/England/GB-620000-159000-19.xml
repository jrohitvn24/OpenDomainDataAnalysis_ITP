		<content>     Our area is a very beautiful part 
 of the countryside. There are many    
{rabbits, foxes, hedgehogs}and other   
 different animals.                    
     All our lanes are bordered by a   
 large variety of wild flowers. The    
 banks are cut about twice every year. 
 Down by Puxton Farm there is a large  
 private lake. The lake is bordered by 
 trees on two sides and  by the River  
 Stour. On the lake you can see pretty 
{yellow lilies.}Not far from the lake  
 there is some uncultivated land with  
 many flowers, including{pyramidal     
{orchids.}Near the lake we saw some    
{hogweed,}but we don't think it was the
 giant type, although it was very big. 
     There are many footpaths in our   
 area. It is easy to get away from the 
 traffic, to observe birds, insects and
 other wildlife.
