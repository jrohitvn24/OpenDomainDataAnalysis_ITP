		<content>  There have been two {houses}on the   
 same spot.The first was built around  
 about {1110.}There is still part of it
 standing.The second was built in {    
{1580.}On the side of the second house 
 is a small plaque with a sun on it.It 
 means that the house is insured by the
 Sun Insurance Company.The timbers from
 the first house were probably growing 
 in the time of the making of the      
 Domesday Book.{Mr Eyston }owns {      
{Mapledurham }House,Mapledurham        
 Watermill,Mapledurham Church and mos  
 of the village and five farms.He also 
 owns the  riverbed but not the water  
 that flows through it. {Mr Eyston }   
 inherited the land from his cousin but
  it was his great grandmother's home. 
 From the woodland they used the trees 
 for Spitfires for in World War Two.
