		<content>  The area contains the market town of 
Sudbury in the east and the fields and 
meadows of the Suffolk/Essex border to 
the west. The town is on the River     
Stour (the county boundry) and the     
village of Ballingdon on the Essex side
is now a part of Sudbury.              
  There are 2 small villages partly in-
cluded-Bulmer in the southwest and     
Borley in the southeast-which rely on  
Sudbury for shops and entertainment as 
do many other villages nearby.         
  Three main road links (to Ipswich,   
Bury St.Edmunds and Colchester),the    
river and the surviving (just) rail    
spur to Colchester confirm Sudbury's   
importance as a route centre. Local    
agriculture, now highly mechanised and 
efficient, together with development   
of light indutrial factory estates     
and a recent population increase have  
produced a thriving community.         </content>
