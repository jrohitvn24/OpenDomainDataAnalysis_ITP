		<title>14BLACKO SPORTS DAY</title>
		<content> Sports Day is an annual event on the  
 first Saturday in June. It is a day on
 which families of the village get     
 together to talk and have fun. The    
 events that are held are different    
 races for different ages. There is the
 egg and spoon race, the flat race, the
 three legged race and others. The long
 distance races are the Tower race and 
 the Cross Country race. Around the    
 race track are stalls with different  
 games to suit everyone. This year the 
 Mayor of Pendle opened the sports day,
 after a speech he set off the first   
 race. Mr. Atkinson recived a trophy   
 for his hard work on the sports day.  
 Mr. Corcaron, a famous Pendle artist, 
 painted a picture for first prize in  
 the raffle. It was a very successful  
 sports day, as usual!
