		<title>08CHANGES IN LANGHAM</title>
		<content> During the last 80 years there have   
 been many changes in the village.Years
 ago people tended to stay in the      
 village,and it was a great treat to   
 occasionally go into the town by horse
 and cart.Nowadays it is a commuter    
 village with people travelling large  
 distances to work e.g.London on a     
 daily basis.The houses did not have   
 piped water,and it had to be fetched  
 from the two village pumps.The waste  
 water was thrown into the brook then  
 in the summer the brook was dammed to 
 form a swimming pool.There were no    
 flush toilets,and people had a hut    
 in the garden with an earth closet.   
 Most people kept a pig,which was      
 killed at Christmas for ham and       
 bacon.Others also had cows or sheep   
 and these were all grazed together on 
 "The Pastures".
