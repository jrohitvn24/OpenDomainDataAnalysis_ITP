		<title>11Mrs Gaskell, Authoress</title>
		<content>    The novelist{Elizabeth Gaskell,}   
 who was a friend of the famous{Bronte 
{Sisters,}spent the later years of     
 her life at{'The Lawn',}an old house  
 in Holybourne, and died there in 1865 
 aged 55, but her body, together with  
 that of her husband is buried in the  
 graveyard in Knutsford, the town she  
 immortalised as{'Cranford'}in her     
 novel of that name.  She also wrote { 
{'The Life of Charlotte Bronte'.}      
                                       
    There is now a road in Holybourne  
 called{'Gaskell Close',}and another   
 called{'Cranford Drive'}in memory of  
 Mrs Gaskell and her writings.         
                                       
    'The Lawn' still stands, and is now
 an old people's home.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
