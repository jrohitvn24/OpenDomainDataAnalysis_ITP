		<content> Blackpool's first mention in official 
 documents came in 1602, as a part of  
 the parish of Bispham.  It received   
 its name from the dark, peaty stream  
 which flowed out of Marton Mere to the
 sea.  In the 18th century, when sea   
 bathing became fashionable, a road was
 laid across the marshes between       
 Preston and the coast, and stage      
 coaches brought visitors to stay in   
 the cottages on the shoreline.  In    
 1840, a railway line was opened       
 through Poulton to Fleetwood and      
 visitors went by cart from Poulton to 
 the sea and back.  In 1846 a line was 
 opened to North Shore, Blackpool, and 
 Blackpool developed into the holiday  
 resort for the working people of the  
 industrial North.
