		<content> MOAT FARM (CONT FROM PAGE 10)         
 The working day starts at 7.45 a.m.   
 when the workers arrive. They have to 
 assess the weather and decide what    
 jobs need to be done. Arable farms are
 highly mechanized and most of the work
 on the farm is done by machine. The   
 workers need to know about and work   
 the various machines, eg. tractors,   
 potato harvester, combine harvester   
 and gooseberry picker. The men then   
 work until 10.00 a.m. when they stop  
 for a short coffee break. Work        
 continues until 1.00 p.m. lunch time. 
 They start again at 1.30 and continue 
 until 4.30 p.m. If there is extra work
 to be done which is very likely in the
 summer during harvest time the men    
 work overtime for which they get paid 
 above their normal hourly rate.
