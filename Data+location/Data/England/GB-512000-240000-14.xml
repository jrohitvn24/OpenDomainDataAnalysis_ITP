{boats.}We also have{hovercrafts }for  
 land and sea.The most popular         
 transport around{Southill}are cars.   
 The village is well spaced out and    
 the farms are set away  from the      
 village,so cars are needed by the     
 people of{Southill.}A car needs a     
 battery to start it ,a steering wheel 
 to guide it .They also need a gear    
 lever to change speeds.A car runs on  
 petrol.The main roads are usually made
 of tar or concrete.Many roads in      
 Southill are old bumpy roads.There is 
 one main road that runs through       
 Southill.
