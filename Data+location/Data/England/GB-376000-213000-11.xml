		<content> bay.The milk tanks were stored with   
 milk and kept cool by cold water at   
 the sides. The milk lorry came. The   
 "Dairy Crest" man opened the top of   
 the milk tanks and took samples for   
 water content. The milk is stirred and
 drained into the lorry. There was a   
 great quantity of milk -976 litres. It
 only took two minutes to empty.       
 Milking is done twice a day, all year 
 round. In the winter time he  has to  
 tidy up the farm,like trimming the    
 hedges, and digging the ditches out,  
 putting new drains in, and repairing  
 new roadways. The machinery nowadays  
 is very different from the olden days.
 When he was our age(11) all he had on 
 his farm were horses and a mowing     
 machine and a rake to rake up the     
 grass. The rest was done by hand. The 
 tractors  came in in the 1940's.
