		<content>    Tick:_ One person is on and has to 
 touch someone else then they are on.  
 Everyone has to avoid being touched.  
                                       
    Skipping:_ Two girls twirl the rope
 around and, in turn, others jump into 
 the rope and jump up every time it    
 comes under their feet.They count the 
 number of jumps until the rope catches
 them.                                 
                                       
    French Skipping:_ A long piece of  
 elastic is held just above ground     
 level by two girls.The elastic passes 
 around their ankles.Someone jumps in  
 and chants "In,out,in,on,out,together,
 in,out." Complicated criss-cross      
 patterns are made in the elastic and  
 then have to be undone.The person then
 jumps out.
