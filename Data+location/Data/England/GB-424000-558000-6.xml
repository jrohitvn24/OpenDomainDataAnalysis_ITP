		<title>06THE TEAM VALLEY TRADING EST</title>
		<content> In 1936 work started on an estate of  
 ready built factories to make work    
 for the unemployed.By 1939 4000 people
 worked there.Today the Team Valley has
 the headquarters for all English      
 Industrial Estates at St.George's     
 House,Methven House is the regional   
 headquarters.Increased car parks and  
 the Western Bypass have been built.   
 New factories can be rented or        
 bought.Those in the Enterprise Zone   
 receive financial help for 10 years.  
 Enterprise house,a new block of 28    
 offices, is so successful that another
 is planned.Today 14000 people are     
 employed in 94 factories. Out of the  
 740 pupils at Breckenbeds School 165  
 parents  work in the "Valley", sadly  
 there is still much unemployment.
