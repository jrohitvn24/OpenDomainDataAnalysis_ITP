		<content> In rural areas most people travel by  
 car. A survey in 1981 showed bus      
 services to be inadequate. The        
 'Villager' Transit minibus was bought 
 initially to serve parishes without   
 shops or schools. Driven by 10 regular
 volunteers, it soon became self-      
 supporting. Passengers pay a flat     
 fare. It now serves people in three   
 counties, covering a 200 square mile  
 area and is used by young and old     
 individuals and groups for shopping or
 social events. It hopes to carry 1000 
 passengers a month in 1986. Pulhams   
 Coaches travel to Cheltenham and      
 Moreton-in-Marsh where there are other
 rail and bus links. A station once    
 stood at Adlestrop but now only the   
 main Hereford - Paddington line passes
 through. Both these facilities are    
 well used by commuters.
