		<content> AN AREA SUMMARY,  HERNE BAY           
 On June 28th 1985 Herne Bay celebrated
 150 years since an Act of Parliament  
 gave permission for the development of
 the area which had formerly been a    
 fairly open stretch of coastline.The  
 area in this Domesday Block includes  
 the first and most important areas of 
 the new town to be developed namely   
 the two shallow bays of the seafront  
 and the two main commercial streets.  
 Much of the early development of the  
 town was as a seaside resort catering 
 for visitors from London, and to      
 facilitate this a pier had been       
 started in 1831 so that steamers too  
 big to enter the bay could still      
 unload their passengers. Seaside      
 attractions and tall boarding houses  
 were developed, but as people's       
 holiday habits have changed so has the
 character of Herne Bay's seafront.    </content>
