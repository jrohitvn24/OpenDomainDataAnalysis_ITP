		<content> Hurstwood House is a home for l9      
 handicapped girls over the age of l8. 
 Those who are capable of working take 
 jobs locally. The home is run by a    
 private company but the fees of most  
 of the girls are paid by the Local    
 Authority. Some parents keep in touch 
 with their daughters. 5 full-time     
 staff run the home which has a relaxed
 and friendly atmosphere and the girls 
 enjoy village life. The W.I. gives a  
 party for them once a year, a happy   
 occasion with a large tea and disco-  
 dancing.                              
 High Brooms Old People's Home is      
 privately run and accommodates 22     
 elderly people, with a staff of 25,   
 mostly full-time. Residents pay for   
 accommodation in single rooms and can 
 enjoy the garden. There is a mini-bus 
 to take them out shopping.
