		<title>15Recreation in Wolverhampton</title>
		<content>Sport of all kinds is becoming         
increasingly popular in Wolverhampton. 
In Wolverhampton there are about 1150  
acres of local parks and open spaces,  
and now the council feels justified in 
boasting about having some of the best 
facilities in the country. There are   
several sports complexes like          
Wolverhampton Stadium,Compton Park     
Activity Centre and the Central Baths. 
In West Park there are many facilities 
for recreation. These range from a     
playground for the small children to   
rowing boats for the older people. For 
those who prefer to watch others exert 
themselves,there is the football       
stadium and the race course.
