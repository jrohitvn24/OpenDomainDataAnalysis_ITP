		<title>01NORTH DURHAM VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The villages are small with rows of   
 terraced red brick houses. Many of the
 villages grew up around a coal mine   
 known as a pit.                       
 There is a strong sense of community  
 in this area. Many people here like   
 the village community with its close  
 contact with family and friends.      
 Many local organisations such as the  
 Women's Institute, Bowling Club, Drama
 Club, Badminton Club, Martial Arts    
 Club, Scouts and Guides meet in the   
 local Junior School. Sometimes there  
 are concerts and plays and these are  
 the main forms of entertainment       
 besides the Public Houses. The Public 
 Houses in this area get some trade    
 from visitors but mostly they are Pubs
 for the local people. There is a      
 strong feeling of community felt in   
 the local Pubs, and there is not much 
 trouble.                              </content>
