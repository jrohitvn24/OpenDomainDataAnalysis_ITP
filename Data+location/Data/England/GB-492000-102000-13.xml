		<content>   There are 24 glass house nurseries  
 in this area.They mainly grow         
 tomatoes,lettuce and celery.They are  
 in this area because the weather is   
 suitable.Heating is by water or       
 gas.The flowers that are grown are    
 carnations,lillies,iris,chrysanthemum,
 roses,alstromerial and many bedding or
 pot plants.They are sold in markets   
 all over England,some are exported and
 many are sold in local shops.White    
 fly,green fly,bitpytis,white rust     
 thrips and spider might affect the    
 plants.These are controlled by        
 Malathios,pyrethrin and numerous other
 chemicals or biological methods.There 
 are more woman than men who now work  
 in the nurseries.
