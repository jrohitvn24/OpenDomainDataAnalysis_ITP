		<title>19LIFE IN STONNALL.</title>
		<content>   Several people were interviewed as  
 to why they moved in to the village.  
 One new resident replied as follows:  
  "After moving from Pelsall I am aware
 of the quiet village atmosphere and   
 identity of Stonnall. It has not been 
 overdeveloped and this is what        
 appealed to me. It is well situated   
 for shopping, being near to           
 Birmingham, Lichfield and Sutton      
 Coldfield. I enjoy the lovely walks   
 close at hand."                       
   Other people questioned voiced      
 similar opinions, adding that Stonnall
 is a friendly place.                  
   Few criticisms were made, although  
 it became apparent that infrequent bus
 services and few amenities caused     
 problems. One 9 year old boy replied  
 to the question, What do you think of 
 Stonnall? by saying"It is nice but the
 school is a long way down the road."  </content>
