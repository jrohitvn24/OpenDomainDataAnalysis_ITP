		<title>02Population of Ousden</title>
		<content> Out of a population of 200 about one  
 third are retired people, some have   
 lived in the village all their lives, 
 and others have retired from cities   
 and towns. Unemployment is relatively 
 low, and of the working population    
 only about a third work in the        
 village, the others working in the    
 nearby towns of Newmarket, Haverhill  
 and Bury St Edmunds. Some people are  
 self-employed, working in or around   
 the village. The average size of      
 family is 2 children and as there is  
 no school in the village, the children
 from 5-8 years go to Wickhambrook     
 Primary school, the 9-13 years to     
 Newmarket and older ones to either    
 Newmarket or Bury St Edmunds. There is
 also a playgroup in Wickhambrook which
 some 3-5 year olds attend.
