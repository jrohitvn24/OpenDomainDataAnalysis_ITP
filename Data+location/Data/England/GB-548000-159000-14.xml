		<content>  On our field trips we have seen many 
 flowers.The{wild dog rose}is a very   
 common shrub in hedges and thickets   
 with hooked prickles on the stems.The 
 sweetly scented pink or white flowers 
 have many stamens and are visited by  
 insects for the pollen.The{foxglove   
 grows in woods,heaths and banks where 
 there is acid soil.Its colour is      
 pinky-mauve.When we went to the river 
 we saw{buttercups,daisies,speedwell,  
{poppies,cow parsley,dandelions,and    
{forget-me-nots.                       
                                       
  On a field trip to Twitton we saw a  
 flower called{vetch.}It is a small    
 climbing plant with bluey-mauve,      
 pea-like flowers.Another climbing     
 plant we saw was{honeysuckle.}Its     
 flowers were yellow and pink.Lots of  
 moths were attracted by its sweet     
 scent.                                </content>
