		<title>14Thomas Harris by Paul</title>
		<content>   Tom Harris was awarded a V.C. for   
 bravery.He was killed in action in    
 World war 1.He was killed but he was  
 brave.In World War 1 he was in a      
 trench with a group of soldiers.He    
 jumped out of the trench and ran to   
 about six machine gunners in an enemy 
 trench.Tom Harris shot the German     
 machine gunners one by one until the  
 last one shot him.The last German     
 didn't get away.That is why my Great  
 Uncle Tom was awarded the Victoria    
 Cross.                                
   There is an old peoples home in     
 Halling named after him and there is a
 plaque in Harris House to commemorate 
 his bravery.At one time only people   
 from Halling lived there but now      
 three men and eighteen women from     
 all over England are living in Harris 
 House, which was built in the 1971.
