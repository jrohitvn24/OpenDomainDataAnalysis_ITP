		<content>{  ALL CLASSES AND AGES IN OWSTON      
  There are 23 houses in or just       
 outside Owston containing families    
 from all walks of life and within the 
 age range{3_70.}There are fifteen     
 children under 12, seven older        
 children and eight senior citizens.   
 Four families have young people who   
 have left the village for further     
 education or work but who return from 
 time to time. In recent years the     
 population has remained steady with   
 young children being born into the    
 village replacing teenagers leaving   
 home. Only one pensioner does not have
 his own home. He is looked after by   
 another family. There are no          
 one_parent families or any very aged  
 or infirm people.                     
   A census is made annually for the   
 electoral roll. Births usually take   
 place in hospital.                    </content>
