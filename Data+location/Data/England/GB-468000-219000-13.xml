There is then the other building.That  
is a long one, which altogether has six
rooms and a kind of cupboard to keep   
paper and stuff in.                    
  Four of these rooms are classrooms,  
but there is also a room thet the      
Headmaster used to teach in.Now it is  
only used a few times.The sixth room is
craft room.Right next to the long      
building,the new building,there is a   
kiln which the craft people use.       
    We have three playgrounds.The      
biggest one is for all the new building
children.Next to it there is a small   
one which we use for lining up for     
dinner.There is another playground for 
the infants.                           
   We have a field which we use as a   
playground in the Summer.              
   We have an outdoor swimming pool    
which we also use in the Summer.       </content>
