		<title>08LEISURE PURSUITS</title>
		<content> In the Collingham area we reached the 
 conclusion that on average people     
 watched 16 hours of T.V. a week .This 
 means that they have time to do other 
 leisure pursuits.Some people who are  
 active choose to do sporting pursuits.
 Of the people we interviewed 20%      
 played soccer.Cricket,tennis,squash,  
 and golf were played by 15% of the    
 population.Fishing was enjoyed by 7%  
 of the population.No rugby or         
 athletics took place in the area.     
 There is a cricket ground which uses  
 the squash club as its pavilion.There 
 are seperate tennis courts .Fishing   
 takes place at the river Wharfe.For   
 the people who prefer to stay inside  
 to carry out their pastimes computing 
 is quite a popular hobby.Some of the  
 population went to social clubs.most  
 people found plenty of time to go to  
 the pub.                              </content>
