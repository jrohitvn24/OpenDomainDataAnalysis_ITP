		<content> I am writing about Flaxley youth      
 group. There has been one every Friday
 for the last five weeks. I go every   
 other week because I go to my dad. I  
 go with Mrs Avery who takes me, Jess  
 my sister, Karen, Sarah and Lynn. The 
 age is from 6 to 10 and the older one 
 is from 11 to 15. I go to the earlier 
 one from six to half past seven. The  
 older one is from half past seven to  
 ten. I usually take 50p, it costs 25p 
 to get in so I have got 25p left. The 
 only game you have to pay for is the  
 space invader, it costs 5p, half the  
 normal price. There is a space game I 
 do not like very much, table tennis, a
 magician set, connect four, a football
 game and a snooker table. I play on   
 the snooker table every week when I   
 get there. The funniest thing there is
 the table tennis you hit the ball     
 everywhere, it is really funny.       </content>
