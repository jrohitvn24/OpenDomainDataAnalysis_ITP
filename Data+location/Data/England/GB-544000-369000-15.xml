		<content>          {John Smith }                
  This man was born at Covell's Farm in
 Willoughby,christened in the local    
 church and destined to become a famous
 Elizabethan adventurer.He went to     
 school in Louth and then went to sea  
 having many adventures before doing   
 that for which he is most famous,the  
 founding of the State of Virginia,    
 first of the American colonies.The    
 best-known story of Smith is how he   
 was saved by an indian princess named 
 Pocahontas whose father,chief         
 Powhaton,ordered Smith's execution.The
 princess threw herself on Smith and   
 pleaded for his life which was        
 granted.                              
  John Smith is looked upon by the     
 Americans as the founder of their     
 country and there is a close assoc-   
 iation between Willoughby and James-  
 town, the capital of Virginia.{See p16</content>
