		<content>{Michael Syddall School}is a Voluntary 
 Aided Church of England Primary       
 School.The present building is light  
 and airy and was opened on the 18th   
 June 1974 by the Bishop of Ripon.     
 Although the present building is      
 modern,the school has an old          
 foundation.{The Rev.Michael Syddall,  
 who was Vicar of Catterick from 1649  
 to 1658 bequeathed the sum of Â£500 for
 the establishment of a school and also
 to provide accommodation for six local
 widows.The school was founded in 1658.
 At present the school has just over   
 200 pupils aged between 5 and 11      
 years.The children come from Tunstall,
 R.A.F.Catterick,East Appleton and     
 Catterick Village.The children leave  
 at the age of 11 years,when they move 
 to secondary schools.
