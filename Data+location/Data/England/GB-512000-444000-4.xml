		<content>     St. Laurence's Church at          
 Sigglesthorne was built in the{13th   
{Century.}It has been extended and     
 restored many times over the years.   
     In 1973 (12 years ago) some lead  
 was stolen from the church roof,then  
 again in 1976 and again in 1982.So now
 they have a stainless-steel roof.     
     The church itself is worth over   
 Â£450,000 including a 100 year old     
{organ}worth Â£63,000,and the{East      
{Window}worth Â£5,000, and not including
 its land.                             
     The church has a small{bell tower 
 with three bells. The church has three
 flags which are flown from the tower. 
     The records about the{Rectors}go  
 back to the date 1200 when Hugh de    
 Melsa was Rector.                     
     The Restoration Fund was started  
 by Sir William Bethal and Arch Deacon 
 Bentinck.                             </content>
