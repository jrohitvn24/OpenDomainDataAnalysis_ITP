		<title>16A day in the life of Edward</title>
		<content>  In the morning at a quarter to eight 
 I go downstairs. I have'Shreddies' for
 breakfast. I then get dressed and pack
 my bag ready for school.              
  Mummy takes us to school in the car, 
 and we can go out and play until the  
 bell goes at ten past nine.           
  We come in, do our handwriting and   
 some number work.                     
  At play time we play 'Stuck in the   
 Mud,' then we come in and read our    
 books and do a 'Reading Route'.       
  For lunch I have egg sandwiches, a   
 packet of crisps and a drink.         
  After another playtime we change and 
 go out to play 'Rounders'. We come    
 back in and do some singing, before we
 go home at 3.30pm.                    
  We go to 'Safeway' in Blandford to   
 buy food on the way home.             
  After supper I do some throwing with 
 Anna, and then we go to bed.          </content>
