		<content> There are large farm houses scattered 
 around the area,with a number of small
 cottages which were originally tied   
 cottages for the workers.The farms    
 have numerous outbuildings such as    
 barns,sheep shelters,pig_sties and hen
 houses.The village has an old market  
 cross centre and the houses on the    
 main street are built of stone,many   
 have been renovated but kept their    
 authentic frontage.As more people     
 moved into the village,so the Local   
 Authority built a small estate of     
 post_war,semi_detached houses,behind  
 the main street.Belford Hall is at    
 present being renovated by English    
 Heritage Trust and it is being made   
 into 17 residential flats and houses. 
 The people of Belford are proud of    
 their gardens,which are beautifully   
 kept.
