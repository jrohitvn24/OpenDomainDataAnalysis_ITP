		<content> Farms wholly contained within this    
 block average 200 _ 250 acres.  Crops 
 grown are wheat, barley, oats,        
 oil_seed rape, kale, fruit, grass and 
 a few hops.  Hop_gardens have         
 diminished by at least 70% in the last
 few years.  The fruit consists of     
 apples, pears and soft fruit.  Much of
 the soft fruit is sold on a 'pick your
 own' basis.  Grass is grazed by sheep,
 with a few cattle in the Brede Valley.
 A small amount of hay is produced.  It
 is interesting to note the change from
 mixed farming to the present          
 concentration on one or two crops per 
 farm. Much grassland has been ploughed
 and given over to cereal production.  
 Many old orchards have been grubbed,  
 including apples pears, cherries and  
 plums.  Sheep numbers have            
 increased with new breeds being       
 introduced.                           </content>
