{Ecology}is increasingly important in  
 the area.{Denaby Ings}is one of the   
 many nature reserves controlled by the
{Yorkshire Naturalists Trust.}It is a  
 big place. It has two big lakes, it   
 also has lots of trees and plants. It 
 is next to the River Dearne. There are
 all kinds of water life; plants,      
 animals, insects, birds. People go    
 there for bird-watching in the three  
 hides. It is a very interesting place.
 There are both full time and{voluteer}
{wardens}working there. There is a     
 field station and information on the  
 things you might see there. More and  
 more people in the area seem to be    
 taking an interest in the natural     
 history of the area, and other        
 reclamation areas and similar         
 projects are mushrooming.
