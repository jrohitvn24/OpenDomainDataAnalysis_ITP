		<title>12RECREATION - CHILDREN  2</title>
		<content> In the summer children make full use  
 of the Recreation Ground, play tennis,
 or may be invited to swim in one of   
 the private pools in local houses. In 
 the winter they watch a lot of "telly"
 but the majority also play a variety  
 of board games. Chess is quite        
 popular, especially as it is played at
 school.    In the playground the most 
 popular games are those based on      
 catching and chasing,such as It,40-40,
 and 19-Out. In the latter the catcher 
 is given 20 seconds for catching.     
 About twice a year there is a craze   
 for playing marbles, lasting about six
 weeks. This is always played between  
 two contestants with the intent of    
 hitting the opponent's marble. There  
 are often bitter disputes as to       
 whether the game is being played for  
 "keeps" or not, i.e. whether the      
 winner may keep the marble struck.    </content>
