		<content> Across the golf course from Prinknash 
 is the Painswick Beacon,a view which  
 stretches across the Stroud Valley.An 
 open place which peaks over Painswick.
 Painswick itself was created in the   
 11th and 12th centuries.This village  
 was once an industrial area.It is hard
 to believe with it's valley's and     
 churches.It was famous for it's 18th  
 century clothiers houses,tombs,church_
 yards and the mills on the local      
 streams.                              
 There is a house of one of the Loveday
 family(now the vicarage),Loveday's    
 mill on the stream and Loveday family 
 tombs by the north door of the        
 church.There are also weavers homes   
 in Vicarage Lane.These people worked  
 for 16 hours a day and there were many
 unemployed.The Painswick people were  
 said to be "too poor to live and too  
 healthy to die".                      </content>
