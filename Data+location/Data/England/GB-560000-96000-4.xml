		<title>04EASTBOURNE BY THE MAYOR</title>
		<content>                                       
 As Mayor I am the Queen's             
 Representative and also Chairman of   
 the Council.                          
 What I enjoy most about my job is     
 meeting people.In the course of my    
 work as Mayor I meet many people every
 week.                                 
 I think Eastbourne is a beautiful     
 town,on one side it is surrounded by  
 the South Downs,and on the other by   
 the English Channel,so it has a       
 natural beauty.Added to this          
 consecutive councils have taken great 
 care to protect this natural beauty.  
 The parks and gardens of Eastbourne   
 are admired by all who see them,and in
 1983 the town won the Entente Florale 
 competition.                          
                                       
         Councillor L. Mason.
