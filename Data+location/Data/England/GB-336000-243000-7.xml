		<content> TRANSPORT IN THE STAUNTON ON WYE      
 Travellers in the Staunton on Wye area
 must depend either on private         
 transport or on the local bus service.
 Yeomans provide a bus into Hereford   
 each morning at 8, with  returns at   
 4.30 &amp; 6pm. A recent innovation is    
 the pull-in by Tesco's in Hereford,   
 much appreciated by elderly shoppers. 
 The fares are reasonable at 65p from  
 Staunton to Hereford with conces-     
 sionary tokens for pensioners. Many   
 families have their own cars an anyone
 living out of the main village needs a
 car. Roads are often bad in winter    
 with little gritting and snow left    
 uncleared for days even on the main   
 road. Walking on the main road is     
 always ddangerous because of the      
 volume and speed of traffic.
