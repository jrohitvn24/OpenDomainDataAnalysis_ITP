		<title>19Housing in Wroughton</title>
		<content>    Wroughton is a fast growing village
 South of Swindon to where many of the 
 village's inhabitants travel to work  
 every day.                            
    The village can be divided into two
 distinct parts _ Old Wroughton and New
 Wroughton _ the dividing line being   
 the a361 road which travels up the    
 scarp slope on its way to Devizes.    
    The original site of Wroughton is  
 at the foot of the steep scarp slope. 
 It grew here because spring water was 
 available. Today the oldest areas are 
 called The Pitchens, Bakers Row and   
 Green Lane and it is here that some of
 the old thatched cottages still       
 exist.                                
   To the West of the a361 Wroughton   
 has extended over the Clay Vale in the
 form of Post War Housing estates.
