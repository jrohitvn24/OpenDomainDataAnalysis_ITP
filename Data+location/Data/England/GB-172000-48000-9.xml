		<title>09Employment in St. Agnes</title>
		<content> Since St. Agnes is a tourist resort,  
 albeit of a quiet kind, many jobs are 
 seasonal and linked with tourism.  The
 small shops; the hotels, restaurants  
 and guest houses; and the public      
 houses all employ local people, many  
 on a part-time or casual basis.       
 A number of local men work at Teagles 
 agricultural factory (in an adjacent  
 "block").  Local farmers and market   
 gardeners employ a few agricultural   
 workers.                              
 Many men travel further afield to work
 in tin mines in the Camborne/Redruth  
 area, following in the footsteps      
 of their grandfathers - in whose time 
 St. Agnes was a wealthy mining area.  
 Many females travel to Truro to work  
 in offices or as staff in hospitals.  
 Numerous nursing homes in St. Agnes   
 absorb a considerable number of both  
 men and women.                        </content>
