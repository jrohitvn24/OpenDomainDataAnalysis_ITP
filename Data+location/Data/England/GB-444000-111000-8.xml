 In 1981 the {population of Bitterne   
{Southampton }was {13 313}.Since then  
 the figure has decreased slightly.This
 might be because of the major changes 
 caused by the Bitterne development and
 because of the {drop in birthrate}.   
 Caroline Andrews' group found that the
 average number of people in a         
 household was 4.8.They also found     
 there was a wide range of occupations.
 They made a study of where some of the
 present residents were born and found 
 that {only one in six was born in     
{Bitterne}.Many more people have moved 
 into Bitterne over the last forty     
 years,changing its character from that
 of a village to that of a suburb of   
 Southampton.
