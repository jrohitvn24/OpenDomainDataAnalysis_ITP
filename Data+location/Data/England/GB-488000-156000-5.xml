		<title>05The Lakeside Country Club</title>
		<content>   The{Lakeside Country Club}was built 
 in 1973 as a leisure centre to attract
 people from different countries. Five 
 years later there was a tragic fire   
 which burnt the Entertainment Centre  
 and Restaurant to the ground. The new 
 Country Club was bigger and better    
 than the one before and now includes a
 leisure club and hotel with a         
 hairdressing salon. The area covers 65
 acres including a lake and some       
 woodland. Waterfowl live by the lake, 
 incuding an unpopular heron which eats
 the fish.                             
   Facilities include tennis, squash,  
 trout fishing and windsurfing. The    
 owner of{Lakeside}thought it a good   
 idea to have such a complex where     
 people could find first class         
 entertainment without going to London 
 45km away.{Lakeside}is the largest    
 entertainment centre in Britain.      </content>
