		<title>03The founding of Elton School</title>
		<content> The Will of Jane Proby (dated 1st     
 April 1712) provided money to set up  
 two schools in Elton.Her Will said    
 "The children when admitted shall from
 thenceforth come every day to school  
 from six to eleven in the morning and 
 from one to five in the afternoon save
 in winter time when they shall not be 
 obliged to come before it is light nor
 to tarry after it is dark.As soon as  
 they come to school every morning and 
 before they are dismissed at night the
 psalms for the day shall be repeated  
 and a chapter read out of the Old     
 Testament in the morning and out of   
 the New in the afternoon and then the 
 master shall go to prayers with       
 them,and as often as there are public 
 prayers in the church they shall all  
 go with their Master thither who shall
 take care of them and see that they   
 behave themselves reverently there."  </content>
