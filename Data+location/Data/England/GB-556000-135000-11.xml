		<title>11FRANT C.E.(CONTROLLED)SCHOOL</title>
		<content> At the time of writing our school     
 has 67 children on roll.  These       
 children are in three classes.  They  
 start school at 4.\ to 5 years old and
 leave when they are 11 years old.     
 The school has 3 full time and one    
 part time teacher.  In addition to the
 teaching staff there is a             
 secretary/ancillary assistant, a      
 canteen assistant and a caretaker.    
 Frant school was built in 1852 and    
 replaced an earlier building. The     
 parish church played an important roll
 in the establishment of the school and
 even today the rector of Frant and two
 members of the church are on the Board
 of School Governors.                  
 Our County, East Sussex, has a great  
 number of small rural schools. It is  
 to be hoped that in the current       
 climate these establishments do not   
 fall victim to educational cuts.      </content>
