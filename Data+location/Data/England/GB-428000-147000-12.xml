		<content> The largest{house}in{Clanville}is     
 cleverly enough called Clanville      
 House!  There are several of these    
 larger{houses}in the block which still
 remain from the days of 'squire' and  
 people.  The is a{petrol station,}    
 food shop and{Post Office.            
                                       
 The local priest when interviewed bore
 testimony to the people as '...very   
 kind and helpful...with a close sense 
 of community...it is a pleasure to    
 live here...'                         
                                       
 The older{houses}are of the same      
 thatch with brick and flint           
 construction which typifies the whole 
 of the area.  Newer housing tends to  
 intrude on these traditional          
 materials, used originally for        
 cheapness and now impossibly expensive
 because of high labour costs.         </content>
