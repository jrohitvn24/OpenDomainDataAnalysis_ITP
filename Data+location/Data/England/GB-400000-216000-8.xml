		<title>08Features of the Church</title>
		<content>    The church has many interesting    
 features, the most unusual is the     
 thirteenth century bell turret which  
 has twin pointed bell chambers flanked
 by tiny pinnacles. Another interesting
 feature is the canopied piscina in the
 chancel. Another piscina was          
 discovered in the South trancept when 
 the old pews were taken out. In it is 
 standing a curious stone basin with a 
 hole in the bottom. One of the oldest 
 features in the church is the Norman  
 doorway on the North side which is    
 blocked up, but which would have been 
 in use at the time of William the     
 Conqueror's Doomsday Survey. A later  
 King of England who left his mark in  
 the church is George II who had his   
 court of arms placed above the entry  
 to the choir to remind the            
 congregation of their loyalty to their
 King.                                 </content>
