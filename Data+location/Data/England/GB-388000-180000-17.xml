		<content>  Our visit to the R.A.F. Station gave 
 us the chance to see inside some of   
 the military transport. Sharon        
 describes our departure."In the       
 morning we went in cars to the R.A.F. 
 Station. When we left school the cows 
 were in the lane so we were delayed!We
 got a visitor's ticket at The Camp and
 parked. We left the cars and went to  
 The Balloon Office. The man told us   
 about balloons. Then we went to the   
 hangar to see the tanks.We went in two
 tanks." James said,"It felt           
 uncomfortable.The seats were made of  
 wood. We looked out through the       
 binoculars. I could see Mrs. Fenner.  
 It was ace!" When we went to see a    
 bus, Stuart pretended to be a driver. 
 The transport moves to &amp; from The     
 Camp, but the balloon and basket      
 remain for use in Hullavington.
