		<content>    The situation between the Pennines 
 to the West and the North Yorkshire   
 Moors to the East has resulted in a   
 milder climate than further north or  
 southdue to the sheltered position.   
 There is a small river flowing north  
 to south in which there is fishing.   
 There are two becks flowing into the  
 river which act as a main drain.      
    Kingfishers and herons can be seen 
 along the river and there is a        
 footpath along part of the river and  
 two other main footpaths cross the    
 area.  Hedges are sometimes absent    
 which means that part of the natural  
 habitate for plants, insects, birds   
 and small animals is absent.          
    The area is very flat and can      
 suffer from stronger winds than       
 average. Most of the area is taken    
 over by farming and not many trees.
