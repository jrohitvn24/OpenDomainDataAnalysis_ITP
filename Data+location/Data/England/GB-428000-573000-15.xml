		<content> In our school the favourite game for  
 boys is{football.}Being a very old    
 building, we have no grass and so     
 we've had to learn how to be very     
 careful when we play. Each            
 summer we enter a 5-a-side            
 team in the Holywell First School     
 Fayre.Painted on our yard is a        
{hopscotch}game which the girls enjoy, 
 although they spend most of their time
 doing handstands against the wall. In 
 Seaton Delaval there are two{parks    
 with swings and slides, tennis courts 
 and bowling greens.                   
 There are two{playing fields}for}local
 football teams, one of which is also  
 used as a cricket field. There are no 
 public{swimming}baths in Seaton       
 Delaval, but our 5th years go swimming
 once a week to Astley High School     
 where there is a learner pool and a   
 swimming teacher, Mrs. Golightly.     </content>
