		<content>  I was very surprised when we visited 
 our village's own cemetery as I did   
 not realise we had one. The cemetery  
 is divided into two parts; the old    
 part and a more recent one. At the    
 entrance to the plot there is a lodge 
 and a small chapel. There were many   
 old graves. Among the oldest set of   
 graves running along the edge of the  
 cemetery there was a special area for 
 infants and small children. The       
 youngest person we found was only five
 months old when he died in 1899. Lots 
 of the gravestones were very moss     
 covered. The oldest person to be      
 buried in the cemetery died at the age
 of 101. In another area of the        
 cemetery there were no graves, just   
 name plates and dates. I think these  
 people must have been cremated.
