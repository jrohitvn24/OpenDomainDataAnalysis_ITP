		<title>16NEW HOSPITAL B'MOUTH</title>
		<content> The new hospital will be situated     
 close to the junction of A338(London  
 to Bournemouth) and A3060             
 (Christchurch to Wimborne) roads. It  
 will be built in two phases and the   
 total cost, minus equipment, will be  
 about Â£41,000,000. There will be about
 290 doctors, 2900 nurses and over 2500
 other people employed there. To       
 accomodate the staff a small village  
 will be built next to the hospital    
 with about 230 houses, each with 6    
 bedsitting rooms including kitchens   
 and bathrooms. It should be open in   
 1990, but some patients will enter in 
 late 1987. The Royal National Hospital
 will give 74 patients to the hospital 
 and will close down. Boscombe Hospital
 will give all its patients to the new 
 hospital, also closing. Christchurch  
 Hospital will give 57 patients to the 
 General but will remain open with 307.</content>
