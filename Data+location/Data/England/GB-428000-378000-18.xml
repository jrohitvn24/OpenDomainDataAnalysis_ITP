		<content> This privately owned children's home  
 is situated at the bottom of Mickley  
 Lane,on the edge of Totley. It houses 
 13 children at present,who are of     
 various ages and live in the two      
 family houses or in one of the bed    
 sitters. They attend local schools or 
 go to work. In their spare time some  
 children attend local scouts or guides
 groups.A staff of eight women and one 
 man care for the children, working in 
 shifts.The children are taken on      
 holidays and various trips and visits 
 by the staff and community groups.    
 Until their ship was sunk in the South
 Atlantic, the crew of H.M.S. Sheffield
 took a keen interest in Cherry Tree.  
 There is a well equipped outdoor play 
 area and a new gamesroom where the    
 favourite game is Badminton.          
 Bedtime is at 8.0pm for the younger   
 and 11.0pm for the older children.When</content>
