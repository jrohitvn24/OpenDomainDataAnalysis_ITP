		<title>05THE VALLEY</title>
		<content> There is a place we go by the         
 Manchester Ship Canal we call "the    
 valley". There are lots of thistles   
 and grass around the place, and a lot 
 of trees. There is a fence to climb   
 over and a slope to go down to some   
 stones right by the canal. Sometimes  
 you see ships going by, such as "The  
 Consortium","The Percy Dawson","The   
 Dovedale", and boats with "Trader" in 
 their name, like "Seaborne Trader" and
 "Mersey Trader". Sometimes the canal  
 smells rotten and at other times it   
 smells alright. When we hang about in 
 the Park and see a ship in the canal  
 we race down there on our bikes to    
 beat it to the valley. Sometimes we   
 race the waves made by the ships. A   
 friend of mine was hit once by air-gun
 pellets shot from the Irlam side by   
 kids hiding from us.
