		<content>  The most amount of pocket money is   
three pounds and the least amount is   
twenty pence.Most children in our class
get one pound per week.Some people get 
their pocket money once a month.Only   
one person in our class doesn't get any
pocket money.About seven people in our 
class have to work for their money.Most
children have to pay their             
subscriptions from their pocket money. 
There are lots of jobs you can do to   
earn money.Some children help their    
older brothers and sisters to do their 
paper round,baby sitting,taking        
people's dogs for walks and doing old  
people's shopping.
