 here because they have comfortable    
 beds and the houses usually have a TV 
 downstairs with a bar for the         
 residents.  Some of these places are  
 expensive but most are reasonably     
 priced from around  Â£7 to  Â£10        
 per person.  They provide people who  
 do not wish to stay in a caravan with 
 an acceptable alternative.  There are 
 many commercial leisure facilities    
 away from the pier. With the          
 development of the marina beyond the  
 survey area water sports will be added
 to these.  There is also an attempt to
 attract people on boating holidays to 
 the town.  This expansion in Walton's 
 tourism in the past years has greatly 
 increased its economy, causing a      
 multiplier effect in associated       
 services.  There are plenty of gift   
 shops and restaurants in the streets  </content>
