		<title>05BURNHAM OVERY - FISHING</title>
		<content> Fishing as a professional activity at 
 Burnham Overy Staithe is now reduced  
 to the cultivation of {Mussels}grown  
 on from stock brought in from the     
 Wash. There is a certain amount of lug
 worm digging, and a few boats go out  
 to the sea for crabs.                 
 Fishing as a more occasional or       
 recreational activity includes        
 trawling for mackerel, as well as the 
 use of nets laid along the beach,     
 where there is evidence of an increase
 of fish in comparison with the lower  
 quantity of the last few years.       
 The cockle strand which unfortunately 
 no longer contains cockles gave the   
 name {Cockle Path} to the route across
 the marshes from Overy to the harbour 
 sands. This path recently renovated   
 by the Harbour Trust with the aid of  
 the M.S.C is used by many holiday     
 makers each year.                     </content>
