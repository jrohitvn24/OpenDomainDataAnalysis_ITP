{Recreation:The Beach                  
{  }A lot of people come to take their 
 dogs for a walk on the beach.Some     
 people come to walk or to look at the 
 wildlife.Sometimes they come to fly   
 kites or to play with their remote    
 control cars.                         
    There is dog dirt and litter from  
 people on the beach.Many barrels,     
 bottles and wood get washed up on the 
 shore.The sea is not very clean at    
 Crosby beach.The area has been heavily
 vandalised.There was a pitch and putt 
 course(a small golf course)but this   
 closed because of vandalism.The beach 
 needs more facilities-at the moment   
 it is not nice at all.A wallwas built 
 along the beach to stop the erosion of
 the coast,as there was heavy erosion  
 in the past.                          </content>
