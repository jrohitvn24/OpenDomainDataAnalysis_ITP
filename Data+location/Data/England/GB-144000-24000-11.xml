		<content>    {Mousehole,}after it was first     
 visited by{John Wesley}in 1766, became
 a strong{Methodist}community.  This is
 still in evidence by the two large    
{Chapels}that are still used in the    
 village.  Although today in 1985 both 
 of the congregations could fit into   
 just one of the buildings.            
     The decline in the size of the    
 congregations is partly due to the    
 greater mobility of the community of  
 today, where many more people leave   
 the locality and even more from       
 outside come to live in the area. This
 has a watering down effect and        
 combined with the general decline in  
 church attendance accounts for the    
 smaller congregations.                
     The{Church of England}followers at
 at Mousehole attend{Paul Parish Church
 which is further inland, about half a 
 mile to the north.                    </content>
