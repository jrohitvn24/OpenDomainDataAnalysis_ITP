		<content>PENNELLS &amp; WILLINGTON COURT FARMS      
 These are farmed as one unit by Mr    
Lyons. Beef cattle graze the lower     
meadows while beans, wheat and barley  
are grown on the slopes of Sandhurst   
Hill. The average Freisian/Hereford    
beef animal is sold for 500 pounds but 
it costs 300 pounds to rear.           
BENGROVE FARM                          
 Mr Warren has a Freisian dairy herd   
and also grows wheat on this 530 acre  
farm. One third of his fields flood in 
the winter every year.                 
SINGLETON &amp; MUSSEL END FARMS           
 The Davis family run these together.  
They are so near the river that only   
one field does not flood of the 120    
acres. Dairy cattle and sheep are kept 
and a few beef cattle are fattened.    
 The farmers use Gloucester Market and 
local dairies to sell their products,  
though some beef cattle go further.    </content>
