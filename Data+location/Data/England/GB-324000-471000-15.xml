		<title>15GLEASTON CASTLE.</title>
		<content> MR.William Webster is the farmer at   
 Gleaston Castle. His wife said it was 
 built in the 13th.-14th.century from  
 stone quarried across the road. It was
 poorly constructed with only rubble   
 between the stones instead of mortar  
 and so fell into ruins long before    
 Elizabeth 1 came to the throne. It    
 was never fully completed, because the
 Scotish raids against which it had    
 been built had ceased and there was no
 longer the need for such a stronghold.
 The ruins of the two completed towers 
 are still there today.It is said that 
 the Harrington family had it built    
 but lived in it for only about 50     
 years. Nothing has been done to       
 restore the castle but there is a     
 preservation order on it. The farmer's
 cows and sheep roam in and out of the 
 remains and there is nearly always a  
 bull around. Perhaps he is on guard!  </content>
