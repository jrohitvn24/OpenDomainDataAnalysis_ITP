		<content> Employers within a 5 mile radius,     
 providing permanent or seasonal work  
 for 1/3 of adults include; M.O.D, 2   
 haulage firms, a major scrap metal    
 reclamation firm, coal merchant,      
 publisher, garage, 2 shops/post       
 offices, school, farmers and market   
 gardeners. Other opportunities exist  
 in light industry, food processing,   
 construction and domestic work. Nearby
 towns of Evesham and Stratford are    
 centres for professional, clerical and
 retail work. Some people commute to   
 Birmingham, Coventry and beyond. Self 
 employed include an electrician, a    
 plumber, builders, carpenters and     
 decorators. There is no serious       
 unemployment  nor migration of the    
 young (except for further education). 
 However, high house prices may soon   
 prevent young locals from remaining in
 this area.                            </content>
