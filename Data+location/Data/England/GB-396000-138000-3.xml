		<content>   Three local schools have been       
 broken into recently:                 
  kingdown,Tilshead and Codford.       
 At kingdown about five                
 hundred pounds was stolen and type    
 writers and computers were vandalized.
 At Tilshead the thieves couldn't find 
 anything so they sprayed paint over   
 everything.At Codford they broke five 
 locks and one window.Â£1.76 was stolen 
 and 3 meat pies. We think they were   
 looking for the new computer but the  
 headteacher had taken it home for the 
 holidays. In Stockton an old lady was 
 robbed when a man said he was from the
 council and she let him in. Later on  
 she caught him taking things out of   
 her drawers and he got out of window .
 The Lodge in Codford was broken into .
 Ornaments and money were taken.
