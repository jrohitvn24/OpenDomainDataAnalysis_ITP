		<title>05CLUBS AND SOCIETIES</title>
		<content> Our village provides a wide variety of
 clubs and societies for people to     
 use.There are several sports clubs,   
 for example, bowls, tennis, football, 
 judo and gymnastics. There are youth  
 clubs such as Cubs, Brownies and      
 Guides, Sunday school and Pathfinders,
 which is for children too old for     
 Sunday school. There are also         
 organisations like the Women's        
 Institute. Clubs are mainly for older 
 people in the village, like the Social
 Club, Bingo, Tennis, Bowls and W.I..  
 Clubs make themselves money and get   
 more people to join by holding disco  
 dances, jumble sales, coffee mornings,
 sponsored walks and bowls drives. The 
 Cubs, Brownies and Guides are held in 
 the old hut near the war memorial, and
 most of the others are held in the    
 Village Hall.
