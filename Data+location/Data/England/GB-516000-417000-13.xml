		<content>{ Titanium Dioxide}is made by Tioxide  
 UK and Laportes on the Humber bank. It
 is used for{paints, paper, plastics,  
{cosmetics}and many other products as  
 well. The waste products from Tioxide 
 are{solid ore}which is unused ,       
 liquids containing{sulphuric acid and 
{ferrous sulphate}which are dumped into
 the estuary. It affects our area      
 because when it is discharged into the
 Humber it produces a{plume of polluted
{water}which is 20 to 40 metres wide   
 and 1km long when tidal flows are at a
 maximum. Evidence shows four main     
 parts of this discharge are acid,     
 ferrous compounds, suspended matter   
 and trace elements. One effect is{red 
{staining}of the river banks the effect
 on the biology of the river is        
{debateable}some experts claim that the
 river is less polluted than many other
 estuaries others disagree with this.  </content>
