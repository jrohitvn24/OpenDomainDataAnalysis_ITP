  The church is situated to the west   
side of the village street in Grafton  
Underwood. To reach the church you have
to cross the stream via one of the     
footbridges. It is surrounded by tall  
chestnut trees and fields beyond.      
  It is a stone building about 700     
years old surrounded by a pleasant     
grave yard. The rector has three       
churches to serve, Grafton, Cranford   
and Twywell. The service times change  
each week so each village gets a       
service at different times from the    
rector. They are at 9.30 am, 11.15 am  
or 6.00 pm.
