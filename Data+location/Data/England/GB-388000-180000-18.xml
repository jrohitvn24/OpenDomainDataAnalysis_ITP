		<content>  Public bus services through the      
 village are run by four local         
 companies.These provide transport to  
 Bath (one return journey per week),   
 Yate (one return journey each week)   
 and more frequently to Malmesbury and 
 Chippenham. Those employed at the     
 Linolite factory in Malmesbury and the
 Buxted Chicken factory in Sutton      
 Benger are transported to work by bus.
 The children attending the            
 Comprehensive School at Malmesbury and
 the Catholic School also travel by    
 bus.                                  
   The railway line running through the
 village is still used for passenger   
 and freight trains.The station closed 
 to passengers in 1961 and for freight 
 in 1965.
