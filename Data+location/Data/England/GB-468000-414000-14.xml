		<content>   The facilities for children are few,
 and maybe this accounts for the amount
 of vandalism in the village. The      
 recreation ground is ideal for some   
 children, but not for the older ones. 
 The public swimming baths are two     
 miles away in Thorne. It is very cheap
 to travel to Thorne on the bus,       
 costing only two pence there and two  
 pence back for children.              
   The bus system which serves Moorends
 is quite good. Buses arrive every     
 twenty minutes on week-days and       
 Sundays, but every fifteen minutes on 
 Saturdays due to the fact that lots   
 more people use the buses to travel to
 Thorne and Doncaster on this day.     
   During the past year the village has
 been greatly affected by the miners   
 strike, which hit the village very    
 hard indeed.
