		<content> The Castle Eden Dene area because it  
 was so far away from any major centre 
 of government was very                
 independent.When Robert Comyn was     
 killed by the Saxons of Durham,William
 I came north and slaughtered          
 everything in sight.Then the Scots    
 invaded and finished the job.When the 
 original Domesday Survey was then made
 in 1086 the area was not included.It  
 was surveyed in the Boldon Book in    
 1183 for Bishop Pudsey.By 1380 and the
 Hatfield Survey the area was vey      
 poor.In 1432 the men of Castle Eden   
 and friends went wrecking at Blackhall
 to supplement their incomes.Prosperity
 did not improve until in 1758 Rowland 
 Burdon Snr. a merchant banker began   
 investing in Castle Eden,and other    
 local property.He rebuilt the Norman  
 castle and church and his work was    
 carried on by his son.                </content>
