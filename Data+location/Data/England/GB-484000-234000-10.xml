		<title>10Traffic Dangers in Bletchley</title>
		<content>   In Bletchley childrens'main way of  
 getting around is by cycling.We talked
 to some of the children in our school 
 about the problems of cycle riding and
 found that the main dangers were      
 these.                                
   Not maintaining their bikes properly
 eg.on one of our bike rides on the    
 Domesday Survey one bike lost a brake 
 block before we started,its chain     
 came off 3 times off on the journey   
 and also the back wheel started to rub
 on the frame so it had to be reset.   
   Riding bikes without lights in the  
 dark.                                 
   Riding in groups.                   
   On the cycle paths there are blind  
 corners so you come up to people very 
 quickly.                              
   Cars and lorries driving too close.
