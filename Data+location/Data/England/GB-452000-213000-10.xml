		<content>The main religious membership is Church
of England,Roman Catholic,and          
Methodist.There is a Methodist Chapel  
in Islip which has a good              
congregation.Oddington,Noke,and Islip  
all have churches.Oddington church is  
served by the Vicar from Charlton on   
Otmoor (outside the area).Noke is      
served by the Rector of St Nicholas    
Church Islip,who also serves Woodeaton 
Church outside the area.The nearest    
Roman Catholic Church is in Kidlington 
3 miles away.Apart from the main       
Religious festivals,and at             
weddings,christenings,and funerals,the 
C of E church congregations are small  
and made up of mostly older women.     
Church restoration is a major          
problem.Noke and Woodeaton have been   
saved for the time being,but Islip     
needs twenty thousand pounds spending  
on it now.                             </content>
