		<content> Apart from farming there are other    
{jobs}in the village which are rather  
 popular for instance there are 5      
 doctors and at least 8 teachers who   
 all live in the village.              
  There is also a photographer in the  
 village who sometimes sells his photos
 to the press and he also takes video  
 film which means we quite often appear
 on the local TV as well as in the     
 papers. Roughly 12% of the villagers  
 are unemployed and 33% are retired.   
 With the population of people on the  
 electoral roll at 278 this is around  
 the local average for retirement but  
 below the average for unemployment.   
 As well as a photographer we have a   
 carpenter and a well known local      
 cartoonist who draws posters for the  
 events which go on in the village     
 hall and other places in the village.
