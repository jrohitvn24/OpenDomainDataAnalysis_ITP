 Mapperley is mainly known for the     
 reservoir which provides water for    
 many homes.  The reservoir is 38 feet 
 deep in the centre.  The reservoir    
 covers alot  of land.  At the moment  
 work is going on to plant a new valve 
 in the water, but first they have to  
 find the old valve. There are several 
 farms around Mapperley, one of them is
 called White House Farm. Their land is
 grazing land, rough grazing land, the 
 surrounding woodland is dominated by  
 deciduous trees.  The land is now     
 owned by the National Coal Board and  
 will become an opencast site in the   
 coming years.  There's a small park   
 called Mapperley Park which has a     
 riding school on it, a campsite, golf 
 course, miniature, steam railway and  
 many other things, there is a house   
 nearby where the ranger lives.        </content>
