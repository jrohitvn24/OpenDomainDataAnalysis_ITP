		<title>14Land Use - Two Bridges</title>
		<content>                                       
 The land around Two Bridges is totally
 contained within the bounds of the    
 Dartmoor National Park, and the       
 ancient bounds of the Forest of       
 Dartmoor. The rights of the commoners 
 still exist but are rarely exercised, 
 and include rights of turbury and     
 grazing.                              
                                       
 Some of the land has been enclosed in 
 the past to provide rough grazing, the
 remaining land being open moorland,   
 also used for grazing. Stock consists 
 entirely of sheep, beef cattle and    
 ponies.                               
                                       
 A small area has been planted with    
 coniferous trees but is not of        
 sufficient size to be of any great    
 commercial interest.
