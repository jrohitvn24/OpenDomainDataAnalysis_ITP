		<title>07Scott's Sad Illness</title>
		<content>   The Greaves family are a very       
 pleasant family who live in Askern.   
 They now have four grandchildren, one 
 of whom,Scott,lived a normal life     
 until he was 5,when doctors discovered
 he was suffering from Cystic Fibrosis.
   Since this time Scott has been      
 treated with special massage treatment
 and also takes pills every day.No     
 matter how much time is spent on Scott
 his disease is incurable.             
   When people heard of this sad case, 
 they helped to raise money for him.   
 The local chip shop owners,the jazz   
 band and my mother,a hairdresser,all  
 contributed in some way.              
   The money is to pay for Scott's     
 visit to Lourdes, where people have   
 been miraculously cured. This is      
 Scott's only hope and everyone wishes 
 him luck.
