		<content>{HOLIDAY MAKERS.}The area is popular   
 for holidays, these being mainly taken
 in caravans along the coast.The       
 holidaymakers come from the City of   
 Kingston upon Hull and the inland     
 West Riding towns and cities of       
 Yorkshire.There are no amenities in   
 our study area but there are extensive
 beaches by the North Sea and          
 amusements and bingo halls in nearby  
 Withernsea.                           
{MIGRATIONS.}Some holiday makers buy   
 small houses and cottages as second   
 homes and there are some of these in  
 our study area.Some unemployed people 
 have sold their houses inland and have
 moved here permanently.(See :         
 Migrations next page).
