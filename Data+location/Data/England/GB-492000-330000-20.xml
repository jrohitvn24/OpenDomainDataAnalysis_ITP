 the project as favourable.It could if 
 successful,provide much needed jobs in
 the area,and also bring prosperity to 
 the villages.                         
{May 1985:"The well is dry"            
 After several testholes had been      
 sunk,the results showed that there    
 was not enough oil to warrant         
 production.                           
    B.P are quoted in saying that they 
 do not expect to do anymore testing in
 hte forseeable future.This suggest    
 that altough there is some oil there  
 ,but not enough to make it economic.  
                                       
{July 1985:}                           
 B.P have moved out of the area.There  
 is now no evidence that the oil had   
 ever been there.The landscape remains 
 picturesque.
