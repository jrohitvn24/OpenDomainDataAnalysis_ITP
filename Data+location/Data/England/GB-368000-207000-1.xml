		<content> THE FARM THAT JASON AND I WENT TO WAS 
 460 ACRES.THE FARM WAS DIVIDED INTO   
 TWO;THEY ARE BOTH DAIRY FARMS,ONE OF  
 120 ACRES AND THE OTHER 340 ACRES.    
 THE FARM HAS A TOTAL OF 260 DAIRY     
 COWS.MR BABER HAS 320 ACRES OF GRASS  
 AND 40 ACRES OF WHEAT.THE FARM HAS 6  
 STAFF ALTOGETHER;2 TRACTOR            
 DRIVERS,3 HERDSMEN AND 1 APPRENTICE.  
 ALL THE SURPLUS GRASS IS MADE INTO    
 SILAGE AND HAY.MR BABER HAS 2 SILAGE  
 CLAMPS AND THEY MAKE SILAGE BECAUSE IT
 IS VERY GOOD FOR THE COWS AND LESS    
 SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE WEATHER.GOOD HAY   
 CAN ONLY BE MADE WHEN THERE IS GOOD   
 WEATHER.                              
 THERE IS A MODERN MILKING PARLOUR     
 BUILT ON A HERRING BONE PATTERN.IT CAN
 HOLD 10 COWS ON EACH SIDE.THEY HAVE AN
 ENGINE ROOM AS WELL.THEY HAVE COW     
 CUBICLE HOUSES.
