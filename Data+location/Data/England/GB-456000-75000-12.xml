 Basil Drake was born in Ventnor in    
 1902. He now lives in a house made of 
 wood in Spring Hill. At the beginning 
 of the First World War he went to the 
 New Forest with the Scouts for a week 
 and that is the longest time he has   
 been off the Island. He remembers the 
 time when there was only one car in   
 Ventnor. He used to travel by train.  
 He was a cinema projectionist in three
 Ventnor Cinemas for 60 years They have
 all closed now. One of his first jobs 
 was to go around Ventnor turning off  
 the street lights. He remembers the   
 horse-drawn ambulance that took       
 children to the Isolation Hospital.   
 Sadly the number of old respected     
 Ventnor-born characters is diminishing
 with the large influx of 'overners'.
