		<content> The Iron Age Fort is now a round      
 field.In the centre of the field is a 
 patch of raised ground where the Iron 
 Age people built their huts so that   
 they were protected from their        
 enemies.Everybody around had to help  
 build it.THe fort looks rather like a 
 bull fighting ring.There was a        
 surrounding area which we think was a 
 perimeter of the fort.The fort was    
 built on highland for protection and  
 so that they could see their enemies. 
 There is a good view of the           
 countryside.The perimeter hedge is now
 a circular grass mound.The diameter is
 approx. 95 metres.The map shows an    
 additional enclosure connected to the 
 perimeter hedge. We could see no signs
 of it but we think it was an animal   
 enclosure.Also at Rings Wood we saw a 
 ditch which we thought was an animal  
 trap because it had some traps in it. </content>
