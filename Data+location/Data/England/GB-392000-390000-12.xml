 lasts for an hour 12.00 to 1.00 pm.   
 Afternoon school finishes at 3.30 pm.

 pm until 5.00 pm approximately watch  
 childrens' TV.  Usually I play out    
 with my friends after tea, perhaps    
 going to the park or playing football 
 or cricket.  I come home in the early 
 evening, watch TV or read or do a     
 crossword or some other game, wash and
 go to bed.  I often complain there is 
 not a lot to do but I suppose there is
 really.  At weekends I play out with  
 my friends and sometimes I go into    
 Stockport to buy clothes and records  
 if my mother will let me.
