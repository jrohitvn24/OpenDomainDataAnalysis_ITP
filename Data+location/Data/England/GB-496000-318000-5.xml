		<title>05CASTLE BYTHAM PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The school is made of bricks,stone it 
 also has a large playing field and an 
 orchard which contains apples pears   
 and plum trees.                       
 We have got central heating now but I 
 remember when we had big iron coke    
 burners with a big iron guard round it
 and when it was cold we all crowded   
 round it.                             
 Our school has had a BBC micro        
 computer since 1983 and now we have   
 got a disc drive and a  printer as    
 well.                                 
 When the children have finished this  
 school they take an examination to    
 decide which secondary school they    
 will go to.All the schools are in     
 Stamford,which is ten miles away.They 
 are the Fane and Exeter(secondary     
 modern)and High School and Stamford   
 School(Grammar Schools).
