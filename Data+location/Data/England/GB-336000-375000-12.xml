		<content>{   Churches}in Ellesmere Port vary    
 considerably. Originally there were   
 only the{village churches}associated  
 with their small communities and these
 still exist today. Collectively they  
 form the Borough of Ellesmere Port    
 and Neston. Most the churches belong  
 to the{Church of England.}The next    
 generation of churches belong to the  
 era when the town was being built into
 the industrial complex we have        
 today. These churches located close to
 the town centre, served the new       
 inhabitants earlier this century who  
 came to take advantage of the new     
 employment.More recently in the 1950's
 and 1960's smaller churches, of other 
 denominations, were built including   
{Roman Catholic and Methodist.}These   
 were intended to provide places of    
 worship for the people who moved into 
 the new housing of this era.          </content>
