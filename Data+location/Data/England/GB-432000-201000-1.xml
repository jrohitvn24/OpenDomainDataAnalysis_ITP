		<content> Agriculture predominates, arable &amp;    
 grassland.  Arable fields are large   
 with low cut hedges.  The enormous elm
 trees which dominated hedgerows have  
 disappeared with Dutch Elm disease.   
 The area (Parish) lost the largest    
 number of elms in Oxfordshire;        
 replanting of other species has yet to
 make any impact on the flat landscape.
 Farmland is drained into the River    
 Thames by ditches &amp; Great Brook, man- 
 made but lush in vegetation &amp;         
 appearing natural. The population,    
 approx. 1400, live in either Aston, a 
 village, Cote, a hamlet or one of 11  
 farms. Houses are a mixture of old &amp;  
 modern. There are no large houses     
 which allows Aston to maintain a      
 working/middle class appearance.
