		<content> The distribution of houses within our 
 block is confined to one grid square  
 in the south east.                    
 These houses, comprise mainly of the  
{terraced}variety, are the nucleus of  
 the old town, some dwellings being    
 built prior to 1850. There is         
 considerable residue of unimproved    
 housing, often in{poor repair.        
 Within the last decade, two hundred   
 and one{new houses}have been built in 
 the Senhouse Street area and a further
 fourteen are being built in North Watt
 Street.                               
 Allerdale District Council report,    
 that there is sufficient housing land 
 for further development but the       
 release of this land may be expensive 
 because of{sewage problems            
 particularly at Oldside, north of the 
 River Derwent.
