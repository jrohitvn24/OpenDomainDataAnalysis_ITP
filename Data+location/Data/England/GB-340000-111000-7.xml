		<content> When we have finished our lunch, we   
 put our hands up. When my mum has     
 said we can go, we go and put our     
 lunchboxes in the corridor. Those who 
 have school lunches just go outside   
 after cleaning their plates up. We    
 play games outside. My friend         
 Catherine and I usually play          
 handstands or we play Tag, which is a 
 catching game. Our playtime goes on   
 for three quarters of an hour, so we  
 have a long time to play. If the day  
 is sunny we go up to the school       
 playing field. If it is raining, we   
 have to play inside. Our playground is
 very small and there are lots of      
 children playing outside so we are    
 always falling over. If we do fall    
 over we go to my mum and she makes us 
 better.
