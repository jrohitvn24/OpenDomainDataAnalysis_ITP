    I live at home with my parents and 
 my little brother.                    
    I get up at 7.00 a.m. and always   
 have breakfast at home, usually toast 
 and a drink. If it is a school day I  
 go to wait for the School Bus. On     
 Sundays I get up a little later, at   
 7.15 a.m.                             
    At weekends we have hot meals, but 
 in the week we have a lot more cold   
 meals.                                
    I have a dog, at home, so my job is
 to give him his water twice a day,    
 once in the morning before I go to    
 school, and again when I get home.
