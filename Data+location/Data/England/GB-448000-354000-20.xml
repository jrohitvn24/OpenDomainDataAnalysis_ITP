		<content> The work on the preceding pages has   
 been produced by children,staff and   
 friends of Greenwood and Kingsway     
 Primary Schools in Kirkby-in-Ashfield,
 a town of about 26000 people.This     
 Nottinghamshire town,which claims to  
 give rise to the Maun,Erewash and Leen
 rivers,was once an important "railway 
 area" though now it has only a mineral
 line and no station.                  
 What the pages do not show is the     
 range of activities which were engaged
 in to produce the information,and the 
 value to those involved of observing, 
 researching,questioning,collating,    
 discussing,liaising,etc.              
 It has been an interesting and        
 stimulating project and one which we  
 hope will have long-term benefits for 
 the participants.
