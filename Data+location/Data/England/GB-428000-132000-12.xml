		<title>12SERVICES: Buses &amp; Power</title>
		<content> The{Broughton &amp; Mottisfont Village    
{Bus}is a community project started in 
 1980 because the local bus service was
 so poor. It provides a regular weekly 
 service to several neighbouring towns.
 The mini-bus is available for hire    
 when it is not on scheduled service.  
 The drivers are all volunteers.       
 The{pipeline}comes from Fawley &amp; goes 
 over Broughton Downs to the Midlands; 
 it carries oil and petrol. It was     
 finished in this area in July 1985.   
 Our main{Electricity}supply comes     
 from the Rectory Lane sub-station.    
 Most power is carried on overhead     
 power lines, but in the village cables
 have been put underground.
