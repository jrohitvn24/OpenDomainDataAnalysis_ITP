		<title>07A DAY IN THE LIFE OF SIMON.</title>
		<content> Monday 7.30am. I would wake up,turn on
 my stereo,have a wash and change into 
 my school uniform.Next would be       
 breakfast,toast or cornflakes with a  
 cup of tea.Then I give my teeth the   
 full cleaning treatment,followed by a 
 round of snooker with my kid brother. 
  At 8.30pm. I leave home and cycle to 
 school.The journey is two miles long. 
 When I reach school I have a game of  
 football or bulldog in the yard with  
 some friends.At school we study maths,
 English,history,science,geography and 
 french.The school day ends at 3.20pm. 
  At home I will make myself a cup of  
 tea and eat some biscuits,while       
 watching T.V.Then I do my homework.   
 Then I either play games on my        
 computer or go to a youth club.       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
