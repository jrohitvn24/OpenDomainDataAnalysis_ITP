		<content>   While remnants of traditional       
 industries; agriculture and textiles; 
 remain, the overall picture of the    
 area reflects Britain since the       
 Industrial Revolution.                
   Essentially, Stapleford, Bramcote   
 and Chilwell are now dormitory areas  
 so industry is minimal and services;  
 shopping and leisure; are predominate 
 and house building commands most of   
 the land that becomes available.      
   The population and housing in       
 Stapleford has been influenced by     
 heavy industry; Railways, Stanton Iron
 Works and motor car components. As    
 these industries have declined, and   
 now provide fewer jobs, unemployement 
 has risen and the population has      
 sought work elsewhere. In this area,  
 attempts are being made to provide    
 new,light industries, especially in   
 the electronics field.                </content>
