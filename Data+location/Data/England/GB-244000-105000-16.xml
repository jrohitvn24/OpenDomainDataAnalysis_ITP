		<content> The Poplars, in Broad Street, Black   
 Torrington, is over 300 years old. It 
 was once a farmhouse but now forms    
 part of a terrace in the centre of the
 village. On the wall is a fire mark,  
 an ancient type of certificate of     
 insurance in case of fire.            
 Bampfylde House was formerly the      
 rectory. It was built by Rev Bampfylde
 in 1830 but sold when the modern      
 rectory was built. The school hall was
 the old tithe barn and Wistaria was   
 the rectory stables.                  
 Maltster's Cottage was a store and    
 workshop for a brewery which once     
 stood on the site of the public hall. 
 Long Hall was a saddler's, Devonia a  
 blacksmith's and The Old Bakery a     
 baker's. Duckingstool Cottage, 200    
 years old, was named after the place  
 where witches or scolds were ducked in
 the stream.                           </content>
