		<content> A playgroup exists just inside        
 Poringland.We interviewed a mother    
 there who said that the community     
 centre needs replacing and they need  
 places like a sports centre and parks.
 She has a husband who works in Norwich
 and a daughter and son.She belongs to 
 2 social clubs the 'Young Wives' and  
 the P.T.A.The people in Poringland are
 very friendly.Shopping is done in     
 Norwich and Poringland and she travels
 by car or walks.Poringland has good   
 schools, attended by the daughter.    
 DAILY ROUTINE: she gets breakfast then
 takes her daughter to school and her  
 son to playgroup.She then picks him up
 at 12.30.In the afternoon she does her
 housework, at 3.30 she picks up her   
 daughter.She then prepares tea,wash   
 and wipes up and then she has the     
 evening to herself.
