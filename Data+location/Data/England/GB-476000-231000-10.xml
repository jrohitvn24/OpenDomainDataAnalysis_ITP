		<content>  The parish magazine for the village  
of Great Horwood, takes the form of    
{Focus} a village newsletter. The      
newsletter is produced by volunteers   
and is distributed, free of charge,to  
every household in Great Horwood and   
the hamlet of Singleborough.           
  Focus contains all the village news  
and contributions from various clubs   
and organisations. A diary of          
activities is included, so that        
everybody is aware of what is going on 
in the village.                        
  One interesting feature is the       
section which notes and welcomes new   
arrivals to the village.               
  Focus is published monthly.The cost  
of producing the dupilicated format is 
met by a regular round of fund raising 
activities.
