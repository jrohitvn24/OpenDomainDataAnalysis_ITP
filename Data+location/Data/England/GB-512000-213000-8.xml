		<content> Harpenden Sports' Centre is in        
 Rothamsted Park.   It has outdoor     
 facilities for football, tennis, golf,
 putting and swimming.  In the sports' 
 hall you can play every indoor game,  
 there are also squash courts and an   
 additional room for other activities  
 such as yoga, keep fit and archery.   
                                       
 The centre is open daily from 8.30am- 
 11.30pm.  Courses are run by trained  
 staff for housewives, children and    
 adults and courts may be hired at any 
 time.  At weekends and during school  
 holidays activity courses are arranged
 for children.   At least 500 children 
 use the centre each week.             
                                       
 A survey of our school showed that 46 
 children used the centre weekly, 138  
 used it occasionally and 139 children
