 After the break we start playing our  
 instruments again until ll.45am, then 
 we pack everything away and go to     
 catch the bus.                        
 When I get home I have my dinner,     
 which is usually fish and chips on    
 a Saturday, then I go and have a look 
 round the town.                       
 I have my tea at about 6.00pm, if the 
 weather is nice I have a salad,then   
 I watch the television.               
 My bed time depends on what I want to 
 watch. If there is nothing interesting
 I would go to bed at about 10.00pm,   
 but I stay up later if there is       
 something I particularly want to      
 watch.                                
 This is a typical Saturday for me,    
 Sharon James.
