		<title>07HIGHEAD CHAPEL</title>
		<content> The Chapel was built in 1358 to save  
 the Keeper of the Castle and Forest   
 and his staff the trip to Dalston. The
 Chapel of Ease operated out of Dalston
 and was never an independent parish.  
 The Chapel was awkwardly placed for   
 use by a wider population which       
 gave rise to the construction of      
 Christ Church, Ivegill, and to the    
 formation  of an independent Parish.  
                                       
 The building was declared redundant in
 1972 and fell into disrepair. It is   
 currently used as a hay store and     
 occasionally for wintering of cattle. 
                                       
 The consecrated fittings were either  
 destroyed by order of the then        
 Archdeacon, or, by public concern,    
 removed to places of safety.
