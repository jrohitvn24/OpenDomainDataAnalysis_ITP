		<title>07ST. KEW CHURCH.</title>
		<content> The population attending the church   
 has gone down and then up since the   
 war,and now there are more ladies than
 men that come.There are 6 bells in our
 church and the tenor bell is the      
 biggest.The church,which is built on  
 shale,is mostly made of granite.After 
 20 _30 years the church will have no  
 more room for burials so they will be 
 forced to use glebeland.Glebeland is  
 fields owned by the church which      
 farmers rent until the graveyard is   
 full and the church claims it back and
 uses it for graves.The graveyard is   
 about one and a half acres.The church 
 is a 15th century church.The recent   
 extension was built in about 1550.Our 
 local church is called St James.The   
 rector of it is Reverend Hugh Fryer.  
 The biggest stained glass window is 18
 square metres.                        
                                       </content>
