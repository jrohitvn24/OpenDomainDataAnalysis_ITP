		<content>   This area is an entirely rural,     
 agricultural setting.It is bounded by 
 the village of Bicton to the south,the
 hamlets of Mytton &amp; Fitz to the north 
 _ west &amp; Leaton Knolls to the east.The
 dominant feature of the area is a     
 sweeping meander of the River         
 Severn,which dissects the region.     
   The area is largely undulating      
 grassland interspersed with mixed     
 (mainly deciduous) woodland &amp; large   
 bands of managed woodland on its      
 fringes.The land rolls downwards to   
 the flood _ plain of the Severn.      
   Population is scattered &amp; sparse and
 _ as one would expect in an unspoilt &amp;
 remote setting _ amenities are very   
 few,with the largest nearby facilities
 being in Bomere Heath &amp; tne county    
 town,Shrewsbury.
