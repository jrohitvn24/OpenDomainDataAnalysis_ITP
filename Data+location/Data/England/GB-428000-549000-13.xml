		<content>{A SCHOOLGIRL'S DAY.}It's Friday again!
 After registration and a spelling test
 we go to the Baths. There,in groups,we
 swim across the pool,doing front crawl
 with our faces in the water. It's soon
 free time - to practise handstands and
 forward rolls.  We return to school on
 the bus.  There's  competition for the
 back seats again! Baths is followed by
 Maths.-usually Geometry on Fridays. We
 are constructing triangles at present.
 I practise  in my  jotter and  get  it
 wrong at first,but eventually it works
 out! After dinner it's Needlework -I'm
 now making a cross-stitch bookmark.The
 day ends with  library and  discussion
 time.                                 
    On returning home,I do my homework,
 play outside  with friends  and finish
 the day watching television.
