		<title>18A WALK ROUND LOSSIEMOUTH.</title>
		<content> An interesting afternoon can be spent 
 following a Town Walk which passes    
 many places of historical and local   
 interest.Start at St.Gerardine's Cave 
 which stood on the site where the War 
 Memorial now stands.On the route is   
 the harbour,which was completed in    
 1838.Visitors will be sure to meet    
 some of the old fishermen who have    
 many lurid tales to tell!The          
 interesting Fishing Museum is open    
 daily and well worth a visit.Ramsay   
 MacDonald,Britain's first Labour      
 Prime-Minister was born here.His early
 home is marked with a wall plaque.    
 A popular cafe called{LA CAVERNA} was 
 once a salt cellar where fishermen    
 obtained salt to preserve their fish. 
 Why not rest here and have a welcome  
 refreshment?The Town Walk takes almost
 two hours to complete but is highly   
 recommended to the tourist.           </content>
