		<title>04Child's Life In Ormesby.</title>
		<content> On week-days in {Ormesby}I go to {    
{Ormesby Primary School.}It starts at  
 8.55am and finishes 3.30pm.I like the 
 school and have alot of friends there.
 When I get home I have my tea then    
 play out.We play tennis,skips,football
 and I play table-tennis.In our road   
 there is quite alot of children.At the
 end of our road there is a shop lots  
 of people in our estate use the shop  
 it sells papers,sweets,cards and lots 
 of other things.There is also a park  
 it is used by alot of people including
 dogs.At the week-end we go out for    
 a run in the car when we get back we  
 go for a walk on the hills.Some people
 in {Ormesby}are bossy and don't like  
 kids and shout at them.In{Ormesby}    
 there are not many facilities.
