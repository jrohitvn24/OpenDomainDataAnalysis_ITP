		<title>11Shoreham Village,Kent.</title>
		<content>  Shoreham is one of many beautiful    
 country villages in Kent.It was first 
 occupied  by {Stoneage} people  in    
 2000 BC.                              
                                       
  The village is quite peaceful in the 
 day but at weekends and holidays it is
 rather crowded with{tourists.}On sunny
 summer days,Saturdays and Sundays,the 
 two village shops have long queues.The
{tourists come from the outskirts of   
{London}and other busy places.the      
 building of the{railway}was very      
 important because it brought tourism  
 to the village and enabled people to  
 live in Shoreham and work in London.  
                                       
{ Shoreham is a lovely village with the
{river Darent running through it,and   
{lies in a valley with woods}on either 
 side.Parts of the bridge over the     
 Darent are 14th Century.              </content>
