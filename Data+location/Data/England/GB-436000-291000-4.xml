 I joined the Etonettes Marching Band  
 in 1983. I joined a week before the   
 carnival and the next week I was      
 playing my flute and marching with the
 band.                                 
    To join the band you have to pass 2
 tests - a drill test and a music test.
 If you don't pass these then you have 
 a fortnight (two weeks) in which to   
 practice your music and marching and  
 then you take your tests again. If you
 don't pass, you have to wait a year   
 before trying again. After playing the
 flute in the band for a year, I went  
 on to play a clarinet.
