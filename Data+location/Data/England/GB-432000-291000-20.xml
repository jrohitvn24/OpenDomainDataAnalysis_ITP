		<content>  Altogether there are 13 Nursery,First
 and Middle (8-12) Schools within the  
 area with 3 Secondary Comprehensives. 
  The oldest dates back to 1855, but   
 new ones have been built as more and  
 more housing is developed.            
                                       
  The children who have compiled this  
 part of the survey come from two such 
 contrasting schools:                  
                                       
{Croft Middle School,}Northumberland   
 Avenue, built on a new estate some 7  
 years ago; and                        
                                       
{Queen's Middle School,}Queeen's Road, 
 built on the outskirts of Nuneaton    
 Town Centre in the late 19th century.
