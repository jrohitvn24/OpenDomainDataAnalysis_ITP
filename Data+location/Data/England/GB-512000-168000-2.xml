		<content>   Hampton is an area of mixed housing 
 styles but it is largely a middle     
 class residential area with very      
 little industry and a large population
 of adults who travel out of the area  
 to work.  There is a local shopping   
 area consisting of small shops with a 
 limited range of goods on offer and   
 there is also a large supermarket     
 which has recently been built on a new
 estate.  However, for everything other
 than the day to day needs of a family 
 peopleliving in Hampton have to       
 travel to the larger shopping centres 
 of Kingston, Staines, Richmond or     
 Hounslow.  We surveyed the shopping   
 habits of 90 families living in       
 Hampton and of these shopping centres 
 Kingston was by far the most          
 popular due to ease of access, good   
 range of shops and plenty of parking  
 spaces.                               </content>
