 as Wolvedon. When John Wolvedon died  
 in 1524 his son-in-law John Tregian   
 became the owner of the house. His son
 Francis Tregian was responsible in    
 1577 for hiding Cuthbert Mayne, a     
 catholic priest. When the priest was  
 found Francis was imprisoned and Mayne
 was hung, drawn and quartered.

 farm. There are medieval buildings at 
 Golden including a milking parlour    
 that occupies what may be a chapel    
 which had a hammer-beam roof until it 
 was removed a few years ago.          
{Golden Keep}(Gatehouse). This has an  
 extremely rare brick pattern that may 
 be unique in Cornwall on one of its   
 walls. There are also two ice houses  
 which may have also served as Mayne's 
 hiding place. The spring marked on the
 OS map(921468) is supposed to be holy.</content>
