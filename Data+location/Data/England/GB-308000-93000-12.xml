		<title>12PRIMARY SCHOOL SPORTS DAY</title>
		<content>                                       
 Once a year in June the Primary       
 school holds its sports day on the    
 school playing field.All the children 
 are organized into four teams named   
 after birds of prey :_ Eagles &lt;red>,  
 Falcons &lt;blue>, Hawks &lt;yellow> and    
 Owls &lt;green>. They compete for the    
 silver Pixie Day Sports Cup. Points   
 are awarded for each event. There are 
 individual races and team events.     
 There are running races but not all   
 the races are about how fast you can  
 run because not everyone can run fast 
 so most races are about being skilful.
 The day is made enjoyable because     
 everyone tries to be a good           
 sportsman, that means if you lose you 
 do not make a fuss. At the end of the 
 meeting the Cup is presented to the   
 winning team.                         
                                       </content>
