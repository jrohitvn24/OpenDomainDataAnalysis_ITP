		<content>      The area surveyed by our group   
 contains two villages - Slimbridge and
 Cambridge - several farms and one or  
 two places of interest.               
      The land is fairly flat and      
 low-lying although there are one or   
 two small hills.  Bordering the Severn
 Estuary as it does, the area is prone 
 to the various climactic variations   
 which accompany the changing tides and
 also to the sometimes severe winds    
 that blow up from the Bristol Channel.
      The main A 38 Trunk Road from    
 Bristol to Gloucester runs straight   
 through the area and this road still  
 carries a considerable volume of      
 traffic in spite of the building of   
 the M5 Motorway which runs parallel to
 the road for many miles.              
      The village of Slimbridge is     
 mentioned in the original Domesday    
 Survey as Heflinbruge with land       </content>
