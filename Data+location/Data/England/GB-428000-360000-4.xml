		<content> Around the town of{Matlock}there are  
 about twenty-five farms.Most of these 
 are fairly small and keep animals as  
 well as growing crops.                
 Most farmers have some{cows}-usually  
 black and white{Friesians}and these   
 give milk which is collected from the 
 farms each day by bulk tanker lorry.  
 The farmers grow grass in some fields 
 to feed the cows.They make hay and    
 silage to last through the winter     
 months.When the fields have been mown,
 sheep are often fattened up for market
 on the short grass.Most farmers have  
 hens and a few have pigs.             
 Wheat and barley are grown on some    
 fields and some fields are planted    
 with potatoes and turnips.            
 The farmers sell their animals at{    
{Bakewell Market}and some corn goes to 
 the{mill }at {Two Dales}to be made    
 into animal foodstuffs. {             </content>
