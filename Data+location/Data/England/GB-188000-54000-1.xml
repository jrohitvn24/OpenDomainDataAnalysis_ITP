		<title>01OUR AREA FROM MILORD'S ROAD.</title>
		<content> Our area is generally a hollow of land
 forming the source area of the        
 Tresillian stream ,a tributary of the 
 Fal.The fields are mainly grass. In   
 the distance is Summercourt,a small   
 village. In the middle distance there 
 are moors and some small woods .There 
 are some fields which have poor       
 grasses and reeds. In a part of the   
 moor there is a settlement of caravans
 and chalets. Five fields have some    
 cattle and one has some sheep in it.  
 Behind us to the east the huge mounds 
 of sand mark the edge of the china    
 clay area. A stack in the woody       
 moorland is evidence of former mining.
  The area is cut across by two roads  
 the A30 and A39.                      
 About 30 pylons spoil the view across 
 the area but there are only a few     
 houses in Summercourt which disturb   
 the rural scene.                      </content>
