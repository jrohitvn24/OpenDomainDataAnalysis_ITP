		<title>13UPTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content> We talked to the ladies in the village
 shop who said that the post office had
 not always been where it now is, it   
 had moved from house to house and had 
 been in three different houses in the 
 village in the last twenty five years,
 moving to its present place ten years 
 ago.                                  
 It is not even marked correctly on the
 current ordanance survey maps!        
                                       
 The shop is open in the mornings only 
 in the week until 1.00 and for an hour
 or two on Sunday mornings for people  
 to buy papers.                        
 The shop sells many things from fruit 
 to shoelaces. Bread and milk are      
 delivered only twice a week so you    
 need to know which days you can buy   
 it! (A can of orange drink costs 18p, 
 very reasonable for a rural village   
 shop).                                </content>
