		<title>13HOUSING IN THE SEISDON AREA</title>
		<content>   This is an area of Green Belt and   
situated as it is only a few kilometres
from the West Midlands conurbation it  
is carefully preserved as such.   This 
means that there is very little scope  
for new building other than for        
agricultural purposes.   There have    
been some recent housing developments  
in that part of the area which lies in 
the village of Seisdon but practically 
none elsewhere.   Many of the existing 
buildings are quite old: some date from
last century but others have stood for 
two or three hundred years.   A feature
of the area is a type of tall brick    
farmhouse, often rather plain in       
design.                                
   Brick is the usual building         
material, red or purplish in colour,   
and roofs are generally made of small, 
flat tiles.
