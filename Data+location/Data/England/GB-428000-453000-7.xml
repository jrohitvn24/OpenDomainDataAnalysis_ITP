		<title>07  A WALK FROM PANNAL ASH</title>
		<content> There is a wide variety of houses     
 between Pannal Ash Roundabout and     
 Otley Road.Some are Victorian and have
 stone walls,slate tiles,chimneys and  
 wooden sash windows.They don't have   
 gardens but yards.The council houses  
 have metal windowframes and brick     
 walls but no garages.Their gardens are
 of average size.The more modern houses
 are detached with large gardens and   
 picture windows,each house has a      
 garage.Among the houses is a club     
 house{(The Over Sixties Club)}built of
 wood and used as a nursery school     
 during the day and for meeting various
 Clubs in the evening.Also there are   
 allotments which I used by the people 
 who have no gardens for growing       
 vegetables.
