		<content>  To local people it is known as the   
{'Cabbage'.}It began in a very small   
 way as a dig for victory effort during
 the{First World War.}Today it is the  
 town's biggest self contained         
 community enterprise with assets      
 approaching Â£160,000.                 
 The Kaiser with his U-boats was trying
 to starve Britain into submission when
 a group of Stockingford railwaymen and
 miners obtained a piece of land and   
 formed{Stockingford Allotments        
{Association}to grow food for their    
 families. They were to become         
 landlords of nearly 80 acres including
 a farm which would have a sports field
 and two magnificent licensed clubs    
 which became the hub of social and    
 recreational activities in            
 Stockingford.When first formed these  
 allotments were on the site of{Cross  
{St.}and{St. Paul's Rd.                </content>
