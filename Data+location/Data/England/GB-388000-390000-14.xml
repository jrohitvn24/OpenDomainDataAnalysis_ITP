		<title>14TAME VALLEY COUNTRY PARK</title>
		<content>  The{River Tame}rises on the moors    
 above{Saddleworth}and flows for twenty
 miles to meet the{River Mersey}in     
{ Stockport.}A pathway has been made   
 alongside the river. Much of this path
 passes through  unspoilt countryside  
 with lots of character and natural    
 beauty. Now the whole length of the   
 valley can be walked along well kept  
 footpaths or towpaths.                
  Recreational facilities are good;the 
 canals and reservoirs provide boating 
 and together with the scattered mill  
 lodges,plenty of angling.             
  Horse riding and cycling are popular 
 and the network of footpaths provides 
 good wallking.                        
  One great advantage is accessibility.
 The footpaths can be easily split into
 short sections so that they can be    
 used for a short stroll, a picnic or  
 for children to enjoy themselves.     </content>
