		<content> The village of Souldrop grew to meet  
 the needs for labour on the farms     
 and at the nearby{Colworth Estate.}   
 At the turn of the century many       
 local people were employed on the     
 estate but now only a few people in   
 the area work for Unilever, the       
 current owner. Unilever's Colworth    
 site is now one of the largest food   
 research establishments in Europe,    
 employing about 1000 people.          
                                       
 Some of the first people to work      
 outside of the immediate area were    
{shoe workers}in Rushden in the early  
 1920's, farm mechanisation having led 
 to a surplus of labour.               
 A few work on the farms in the area,  
 some work in Rushden or Thurleigh,    
 while others{commute}further afield to
 Bedford, Luton and even London.
