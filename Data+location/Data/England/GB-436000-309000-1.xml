		<content> The area contains two small           
 Leicestershire villages - Heather and 
 Swepstone. The relatively flat        
 environment is characterised by a     
 mixture of open-cast mining, arable   
 farming or stock-rearing, and small   
 enterprises such as the brick and     
 chemical works, as well as providing a
 residential area for many that commute
 to work.  The City of Leicester is    
 about 15 miles away, whilst Ashby and 
 Coalville are within a 5-mile radius. 
 Figures from the latest Census are:   
 Parish of Heather - Population 837.   
 Employed in Mining, 40; Agriculture 0.
 Parish of Swepstone - Population 522. 
 Employed in Mining, 30; Agriculture   
 30.  Unemployment figures for North   
 West Leicestershire, which includes   
 this area, in March 1985 were 3,441.  
 In percentage terms, this is 9.6%.
