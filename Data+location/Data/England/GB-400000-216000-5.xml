		<title>05Modern Farming</title>
		<content>    The farm is over 400 acres and has 
 22 fields altogether. The farmer grows
 barley, wheat, oats, peas, beans,     
 fodder beet and sanfoin. The latter   
 indigenous to the Cotswolds. He has a 
 few cows and calves, mainly Fresian   
 and Hereford and 14 Jacob sheep. They 
 do not have any horses, but when they 
 first came there used to be 10 cart   
 horses; these were sold whsn they     
 bought their first tractor. Today the 
 farmer has much machinery on his farm,
 including 5 tractors, a combine       
 harvester, a plough, a sprayer,       
 trailers, harrows and a corn drier.   
 All this means that farming today is  
 totally mechanised and that farmers   
 now need to be highly trained if they 
 are to keep up with the demands of    
 modern farming.
