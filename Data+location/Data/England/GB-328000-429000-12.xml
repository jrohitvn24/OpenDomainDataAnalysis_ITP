		<content> The aircraft should unload its        
 passengers or freight and keep the    
 runway clear for the next aircraft,   
 which may be fast approaching the     
 runway.                               
       When an aircraft has loaded its 
 fuel,baggage and passengers the pilot 
 makes a radio call to the aerodrome   
 controller for permission to start    
 engines.The controller tells him when 
 to start so there will not be a delay 
 in the air or on the ground.          
 Air traffic control is also           
 responsible for the safety of the     
 aircraft on the ground,and their      
 responsibility only ends when the     
 aircraft is finally parked on the     
 apron. For departing aircraft,the     
 controller is responsible until he    
 hands the aircraft over to another    
 airspace.                             
                                       </content>
