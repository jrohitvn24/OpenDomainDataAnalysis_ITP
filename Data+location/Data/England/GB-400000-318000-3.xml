		<content>Dad gets home about 6.45pm if he is not
out on call. Dad also works nights,    
when he does he goes out about 5.00pm  
and comes home about 9.45am the next   
day. The station which he is at is     
quite busy.                            
Mom works at one of the local hotels   
called Eaton Lodge. She's worked there 
for nearly 10 years as a silver service
waitress. Mom has no set days to work, 
just when they need her which on       
average is about three times a week    
plus weekends. Most of her diners are  
residents (people who stay in the      
hotel) some are non-residents. They are
busy nearly every night, but Mom enjoys
it when it's busy. The hotel has an    
al-a-carte menu for the evenings, but a
cheaper menu at lunch time. Mom also   
trains any new girls who want to become
waitresses. She enjoys the work as she 
meets all kinds of people.             </content>
