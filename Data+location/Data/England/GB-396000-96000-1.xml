		<title>01History of Corfe Mullen</title>
		<content>{Corfe Mullen}covers just over 3000    
 acres of land in Dorset.The area of   
 the Parish is roughly triangular and  
 stetches from the river Stour in the  
 north to Upton Heath in the south.    
                                       
 The original village was found around 
 the church on a flat,dry river bed in 
 the north-west corner.The Knoll and   
 the Sleight were both in existence by 
 1327.18th and 19th century farmhouses 
 were found around the Sleight.        
                                       
 The Parish boundary with Poole on the 
 east runs along largely with the Roman
 Road from Hamworthy in the Parish of  
 Poole.
