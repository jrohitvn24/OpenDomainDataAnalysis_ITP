		<content>There are 7 shops in Geddington. The   
Post Office attracts the most          
customers. The Co-op in West Street is 
large and also used by many residents. 
There are 3 other shops that sell food 
in the village:- the Butchers, The     
Village Pantry and Chapmans.           
Fresh bread is sold by 3 shops in the  
village but many residents would like  
there to be a bakery on site. Fresh    
bread and vegetables are the items that
most people buy in the village but they
do their main shopping in Kettering    
where it is cheaper. Some residents use
no village shops at all.
