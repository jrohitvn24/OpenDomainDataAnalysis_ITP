		<title>19Popular Games</title>
		<content> One of the most popular games at the  
 moment is conkers.This is because the 
 conkers are now falling off the trees.
 To play conkers you first make a hole 
 through the conker with a skewer then 
 thread string through it.The idea is  
 to break each others conker.Another   
 popular game is snooker.It is also one
 of my favourites.On television at the 
 moment is the Goya snooker match and  
 my favourite player is Jimmy White.   
 Snooker is played with a cue, 15 red  
 balls and one each of yellow, brown,  
 green, blue, pink, black, and a white 
 cue ball.The idea is to pot the balls 
 in the pockets of the table.You pot a 
 red ball first then a coloured        
 ball.The maximum break is 147.Today   
 many children have computers and there
 are lots of games made for them.A     
 favourite board game is Monopoly which
 has been enjoyed for many years.      </content>
