		<title>17HOYLAKE LIFEBOAT</title>
		<content>   The Hoylake Lifeboat,{Mary Gabriel, 
 serves the area of Liverpool Bay from 
 Point of Ayr to the Ribble estuary. It
 is a self-righting lifeboat, housed on
 the promenade and has to be drawn by  
 tractor into deep water. This can take
 14 minutes at low tide. Top speed is  
 8-9 knots and in high waves it tows a 
 sheet anchor to help stability.       
                                       
   The crew of 7 men is drawn from a   
 team of 16. All have regular jobs in  
 the local area and are alerted by     
 maroons and 'personal bleepers' when  
 there is an emergency.                
                                       
   "My first impression was how small  
 the boat was, but the anchor was      
 larger than I had imagined", said     
 Clare, after visiting the Lifeboat    
 Station.
