		<title>04FARMING - DERWENT VALLEY</title>
		<content> Other jobs include collecting eggs and
 cleaning byres, stables and hen       
 houses. Surplus eggs are sold to the  
 butcher's in the local village.       
    There is a lot of woodland around  
 the farm where some wildlife live;    
 badgers, red squirrels, foxes, moles, 
 partridges, rabbits, pheasants and    
 deer.                                 
    The farmer was born on the farm;   
 his great grandfather was a farmer and
 he didn't want to do anything else. He
 loves farming and says that you       
 wouldn't want to do it if you didn't  
 like it.                              
    The farm freezes many fruits, such 
 as blackberries, raspberries,         
 gooseberries, strawberries, rhubarb,  
 blackcurrants, plums and apples.
