		<title>17OWLETT HALL</title>
		<content>{Owlett Hall}is to be found near{West  
{Hardwick,}a{small village}set amongst 
 arable and pasture land. Owlett Hall  
 is a small but attractive{stone built 
{farmhouse.}We found that it was{built 
{in 1851}from the{inscription in Roman 
{numerals (MDCCCL1)}which is carved    
 under the eaves.                      
 Owlett Hall is used entirely for{pig  
{farming}over 16 acres. The farm has   
 over 200 sows, 50 boars and           
 approximately 1000 piglets. The pigs  
 are{sold}to anyone who wishes to buy  
 them.                                 
{The present owners}of the hall have   
 been there for just over 1 year. They 
 like West Hardwick, finding it a      
 peacful and friendly place to live.
