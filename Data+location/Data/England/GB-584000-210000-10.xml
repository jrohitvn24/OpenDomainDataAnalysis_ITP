		<title>10Richards Wednesday In School</title>
		<content>      My typical Wednesday at School   
 would start with a vigourous session  
 of swimming, in the school pool, 10   
 metres long, 6-7 metres wide. The     
 session would be supervised by our    
 brilliant teacher Mrs. Albert. We have
 two groups, one swims for 30mins while
 the others work in the class on Stride
 Ahead, or various other activities.   
 With chattering teeth, we emerge from 
 the pool, and then have Mixed Lessons 
 from 9.30 to Assembly. In June , Mrs. 
 Albert introduced 'Blue Cards'.       
 We could work at our own pace, as long
 as we got the week's work done.       
      After Lunch we have USSR! (Really
 Silent Reading). Next is our Music    
 lesson. I help get out the equipment, 
 while we are taught Tempos and Rhythms
 from books and sheets. Lastly, Topic  
 Work, where we draw graphs and measure
 bits and pieces for Mr. Want.         </content>
