		<content> Tuesday 11 June 1985.                 
 For breakfast I had Sugar Puffs.Sugar 
 Puffs are balls of wheat covered      
 insugar to which you add milk.I also  
 had a glass of fruit juice.           
 For my dinner I had ham roast potatoes
 and vegetables.For pudding I had      
 carabar which is a biscuit with a     
 toffee and chocolate coating.This was 
 my school meal.                       
 When I went home after school I had   
 some Chocamints.They are chocolates   
 with mint in the middle.              
 After playing outside I had my        
 tea.I had cheese on toast.Toast is    
 grilled bread and the cheese is melted
 on the top.This was followed by an    
 apple and a bar of chocolate.         
 Before bed I had my supper which was  
 biscuits and a drink of hot cocoa.    
                                       
                                       </content>
