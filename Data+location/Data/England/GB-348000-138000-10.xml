		<title>10Religion in Glastonbury</title>
		<content> At the heart of the town are the      
 ruins of one of the greatest abbeys of
 Britain.  Nearby is a mineral spring  
{(Chalice}Well),possibly a sacred place
 in pagan times, and the{Tor}with its  
 mysterious terraces,topped by a ruined
 church tower. Glastonbury still draws 
 great numbers of seekers of all kinds.
 An Anglican Pilgrimage, attended by   
 several thousand, and a Roman Catholic
 Pilgrimage are annual events. Essenes,
 Druids and others come here to perform
 their rites.                          
 There are two Anglican churches,one,an
 Anglo-Catholic with fine musical trad-
 ition;a Roman-Catholic, a Methodist,  
 a United Reform Church,a Gospel Hall, 
 and Christian Fellowship; also British
 Israelites and a branch of the British
 Meditation Society. Abbey House run by
 the Sisters of Charity is used for    
 retreats and conferences.             </content>
