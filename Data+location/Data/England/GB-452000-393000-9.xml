		<content> There are approximately 20 farms. The 
 average size of each would be around  
 140 acres. The majority of the land is
 arable. The main crops grown are      
 wheat, barley, potatoes, oil seed rape
 and sugar beet. Some farmers keep     
 cattle, pigs and sheep. Nowadays      
 farming has changed considerably due  
 to machinery availability which is    
 labour and time saving. Farms have    
 most of the following machinery       
 available; combine harvester, sprayer,
 baler, hay turner, cultivator, drill, 
 fertilizer spreader, muck spreader,   
 rollers, elevator, potato riddler,    
 mower, potato and sugar beet          
 harvester, and discs.                 
  Some of the farmers are tenants. A   
 tenant is a farmer who does not own   
 any of his land or farm yard.         
 Approximately 60% of the land is owned
 and 40% is tenanted.                  </content>
