		<content>     On May the first it is May Day.   
On May day  you get an old             
pole and decorate it with              
material,paper,card,crepe-paper and    
then put streamers on it.Then the      
children would take them to school with
them.They would go to the hall and the 
children would get in groups and a     
group at a time would walk into the    
middle of the room and would dance     
around to the music.When they had      
finished they would crown the May      
Queen.                                 
     The Junior Schools do not have a  
May Day.
