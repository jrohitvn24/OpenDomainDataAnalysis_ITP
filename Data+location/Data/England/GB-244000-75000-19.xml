		<title>19GREEN LANES IN LAMERTON-1</title>
		<content>                                       
 When we looked at a map of our area   
 we noticed several small lanes marked,
 which appear to lead nowhere.They     
 usually end in a field.These are old  
 roads which have been by-passed by new
 ones,or disused bridle paths.Most of  
 them are overgrown,and have mud and   
 grass surfaces,so they are known as   
{Green Lanes.                          
 We explored one green lane in         
 particular (ref.o45076).We found a    
 large variety of plants and flowers,as
 well as some interesting man made     
 objects.We found a horseshoe,some old 
 farm machinery,some broken pottery and
 a very old lady's boot. We sent the   
 boot to the museum,and they thought   
 that it was dated 1915-1920,as this   
 type of boot was fashionable then.The 
 museum gave us advice about cleaning  
 it,so that we may display it.         </content>
