		<content> Residents mode of thinking and        
 attitude towards various subjects     
 takes several directions.             
 International, national and local     
 affairs are all topics of             
 conversation. Nuclear war is uppermost
 in the minds of people surrounded as  
 the area is by Ministry of Defence    
 property, a prime target for any      
 nuclear attack. Many argue that a     
 nuclear deterrant is necessary wheras 
 others argue that it only enhances the
 chance of nuclear warfare. The state  
 of the country, racial unrest and     
 civil disturbances are all topics of  
 conversation. Being a farming         
 community the everyday worries are,   
 the weather, general state of farming,
 the common market policies, prices at 
 the fat stock market, the rising cost 
 of machinery and ever increasing land 
 rent                                  </content>
