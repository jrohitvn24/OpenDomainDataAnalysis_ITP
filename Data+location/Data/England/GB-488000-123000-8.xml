		<content>{The Hip Joint Replacement Unit}was    
 established in 1969 under the         
 direction of Professor Sir John       
 Charnley.  It is served by five       
 Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeons who   
 attend the hospital frequently, and   
 more than 300 patients from all parts 
 of the world are admitted each year   
 for hip replacements.                 
 One of the four operating theatres has
 been equipped with a{Charnley-Howorth 
{"Clean Air" Enclosure}which provides a
 laminar flow of purified air.  Inside,
 the operating team wear special       
 operating clothing from which body-   
 exhausts are extracted by a special   
 unit providing additional precaution  
 against infection, the most common    
 cause of post-operative failure in    
 orthopaedic surgery.
