		<title>02Coleford May Day Gala</title>
		<content> The {Gala}was held on  May 6th at     
 Highbury playing fields in Coleford.  
 The{May Day Gala}opened at 2.00pm when
 they crowned the {May Queen }and her  
 attendants. There were lots of stalls.
      One of the stalls was called Aunt
 Sally.  You paid 10p for balls and you
 had to throw the balls at china cups, 
 plates, jugs, etc....It was good fun  
 smashing all the plates and things    
 but you didn't win anything.          
   Just a little way down from the Aunt
 Sally there were the skittles and if  
 you knocked down 9 skittles you won   
 50p and if you knocked down more than 
 9 skittles you won Â£1.00.             
   The brownies were doing the cake    
 stall.  It was good fun at the May Day
 Gala because there were lots of stalls
 to look at and play on.All the money  
 that we raised was going to the scout 
 hall.{                                </content>
