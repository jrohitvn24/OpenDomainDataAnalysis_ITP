		<title>08SOUTH SELSEY'S BUILDINGS</title>
		<content>   Selsey has a variety of types of    
 buildings.On a walk around our part we
 counted nine{thatched houses.}There   
 are a number of new{bungalows}and two 
 new estates both overlooking the      
 sea.Other houses are old and mainly   
 large. Several of these have been     
 converted into{flats}or{Rest Homes.   
 One of the{cottages}we found          
 interesting was{Paisley Cottage.      
 Hidden amongst the trees the cottage  
 is set in a large garden with big iron
 gates.It is mock Tudor in style,and   
 has round windows like milk bottle    
 tops.The house is decorated with      
 black and white clubs (as on playing  
 cards).On one side of the front door  
 is a picture of the Selsey Tram,on the
 other,the Chichester Market Cross.The 
 windows are of leaded light panes.    
 Inside the house is decorated with    
 Paisley wall paper.                   </content>
