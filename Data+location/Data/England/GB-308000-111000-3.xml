      As in many other villages        
 Culmstock has it's own local dialect  
 which is difficult for an outsider to 
 understand.Outsider in this case      
 meaning someone who has not been      
 living  in the village for at least   
 twenty years!Although still used there
 is an increasing risk that many of    
 these expressions will be lost to     
 general usage.The spelling in many    
 cases is open to variation as is the  
 pronunciation.                        
                                       
{AMESES     }Wood and metal curved     
             frame round horse collar  
{AVEERED   } Afraid                    
{
