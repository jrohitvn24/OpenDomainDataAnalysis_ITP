		<content>    Flamstead stores has been open  for
 100 years although the present owners 
 have only been there for one year.    
 They were looking for a job in a      
 village where they could work for     
 themselves, have there own business.  
 Both the husband and wife work full   
 time in the shop.  Their customers    
 come from the village and pop in for  
 stamps or any other requirement.  Only
 older people tend to use it for all of
 their groceries since prices are      
 higher than in a supermarket.         
    The present owners are trying to   
 improve the shop by knocking down a   
 wall and introducing a more           
 supermarket type of system.
