		<title>16The village of Hunningham.</title>
		<content> Mrs Ellis's nearest shop is in{Weston 
 or{Eathorpe.}Her nearest{doctor}is    
 in{Lillington}and she has to travel   
 quite a way if she becomes ill.After  
 the school's closure it became a      
{village hall,}but its owner,Lord Leigh
 wanted to sell it for a price the     
 village couldn't afford.It is now     
 being converted into a house.Mrs Ellis
 feels that the village people need    
 somewhere to meet and get to know each
 other.                                
     The village has a small church,{  
{St.Margarets }and shares a vicar with 
 the parishes of {St.Michael}, Weston  
 Under Wetherley and {St.John The      
{Baptist}, Wappenbury.                 
     Wappenbury also has a Roman       
 Catholic church, {St.Anne's}.         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
