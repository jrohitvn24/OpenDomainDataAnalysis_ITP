		<title>11Farming: Beef Cattle</title>
		<content> Berwick Hill Farm has a breeding herd 
 of 75 cows, their calves and their    
 replacement heifers. The cows are     
 Friesian Hereford crosses and cross   
 Charollais animals. Charollais bulls  
 are used to provide calves fit for    
 fattening on either grass or by       
 intensive methods. The cows calve down
 in July and August and remain at grass
 until October. The whole herd is      
 housed during the winter months, the  
 cows in a semi-covered yard, and the  
 calves having access to covered       
 accommodation, where they are fed hay 
 and cake. The cows winter on treated  
 straw and rolled barley. In Spring the
 herd is put out to grass again.The    
 calves are weaned in May, replacement 
 heifers are selected and retained on  
 the farm. The rest are sold to be     
 fattened elsewhere.
