		<title>06Brazils Farm</title>
		<content>    Mr. Cooper keeps 100 milking cows  
 on his farm, but in Autumn he grazes  
 36 Herefords. The 106 acres of the    
 farm are split 37 for grass, 36 for   
 wheat and 63 acres for barley. All    
 these crops go towards feeding cattle.
 The grass is cut for silage. No hay is
 used on this farm. Some of the barley 
 is put through the dresser for fodder 
 while the rest is  sold with the      
 wheat.                                
    This is one of the smaller farms we
 visited and Mr. Cooper is the tenant. 
    In 1944 a V2 rocket destroyed the  
 Essex barn, so another was rebuilt in 
 1946.                                 
    Nowadays only 2 people work on the 
 farm. Contractors are hired with their
 machines to cut the crop and bale the 
 hay. Round bales are preferred today.
