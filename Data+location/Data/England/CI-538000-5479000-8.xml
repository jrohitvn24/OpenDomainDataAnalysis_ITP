		<title>08Energy in Herm.</title>
		<content> Herm has a small power house where all
 the electricity used on the island is 
 generated. It is situated in a central
 position at the top of the island in  
 the old farm buildings.               
 There are three DAF generators, each  
 with a power output of 71 kilowatts,  
 though normally only one is run at a  
 time.                                 
 The diesel oil which the engines use  
 is shipped over from Guernsey by boat,
 and piped to the power house from the 
 harbour. In summer about 300 litres of
 oil are used each day, and in winter  
 when the number of people on the      
 island is smaller, about 225 litres   
 per day.                              
 Bottled gas and coal are also shipped 
 over from Guernsey and used for much  
 of the cooking and heating on the     
 island.
