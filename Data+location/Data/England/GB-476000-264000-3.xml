		<title>03CHRISTOPHER'S HOLIDAY.</title>
		<content>My name is Christopher, this story is  
about the time when my sister and I    
visit Dad in the Lake District in the  
last two weeks of the summer holiday.  
We left Northampton station at 1.30pm  
and the journey took 4 hours.On the    
journey we played games like Connect4  
and Chess.When we arrived we had tea   
at The Rembrant Restaurant. When we    
arrived at Dad's house we had a cup of 
tea, played Careers and went to bed.   
Next day Grandma arrived.As soon as    
Grandma had unpacked we had dinner.    
For the rest of the day we amused      
ourselves. The day after that Grandma  
and I went to Brockhole and Dad took   
Rachel up Helvelin, a mountain.It      
rained almost all day.We took a picnic 
lunch and went home for tea. The next  
day I went with Dad and Rachel went    
with Grandma. The next dayÂ£s weather   
was unsettled so we all stayed in.     </content>
