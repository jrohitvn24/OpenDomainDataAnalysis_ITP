		<title>04"BEDGEBURY"</title>
		<content>   First mentioned in an A.D. 814 deed,
 Bedgebury Manor was owned by several  
 de Bedgebury and Colepeper generations
 living in the original house where the
 Great Lake is now.  In 1862-8 Hayes   
 built the present manor in red brick, 
 a later dam forming the Great Lake.   
   Lord Beresford bought Bedgebury in  
 1836, encasing the house with local   
 sandstone.  He married Louisa Hope;   
 the name Beresford-Hope is linked with
 many 19C developments in the Kilndown 
 and Bedgebury areas.  The estate was  
 eventually split between Crown (later 
 Forestry Commission) and School.      
   The house basement contains services
 e.g. laundry; ground floor has library
 and diningrooms; sanatorium and staff 
 rooms are on the first floor; above   
 are dormitories.  Former stables and  
 lofts are now studios, laboratories,  
 classrooms, Chapel and 6th Form rooms.</content>
