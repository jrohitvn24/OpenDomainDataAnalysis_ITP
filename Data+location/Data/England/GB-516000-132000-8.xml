		<content> Most people in this area own some sort
 of pet.  The variety of pet can be    
 split into 6 main groups.  These are: 
 Small Rodents; Rabbits and Guinea     
 Pigs; Cats and Dogs; Birds; Fishes;   
 Horses.  When and if you do own a pet 
 you need to look after it carefully.  
 Out of 220 children there were 292    
 pets, mainly cats and dogs.  A few    
 people have gerbils, chickens, ducks, 
 rats, cockateels, terrapins, toads,   
 canaries, horses, hedgehogs and birds.
 All together there were 22 different  
 species of pets.Some pets are quite   
 expensive to buy and keep like horses,
 dogs, large birds, snakes, monkeys and
 reptiles.  Others are cheaper like    
 rodents, fish and cats.  Some animals 
 live for 1 year and others for 60.    
 Some animals stay the same size,      
 others do not. We have to choose a pet
 carefully.                            </content>
