 farm equipment like tractors,combine  
 harvesters and other machines.The     
 administration block is also in this  
 area where they make sure the college 
 runs smoothly.One of the main parts of
 the college is the horticultural      
 department which includes a fruit     
 garden,vegetable garden,school garden,
 layer beds and nursery stock.There is 
 also a tropical green house which has 
 lots of plants and trees from warmer  
 climates.There are several green      
 houses made of glass and polythene.   
 These are there so students can learn
