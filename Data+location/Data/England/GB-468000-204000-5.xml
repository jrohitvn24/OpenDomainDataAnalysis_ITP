		<content>The Health Centre has been open for 12 
years. There are two practices with 9  
doctors in all. The centre holds       
records for 14000 people. These records
are strictly confidential. The Thame   
centre covers Thame, Tetsworth, Tidding
-ton, and Towersey. The oldest         
registered man is 99 and the oldest    
lady a year younger although we were   
told that ladies live longer on        
average. while we were there the baby  
clinic was open. We saw two children   
whowere attending the clinic. Ben was 5
months old and was just trying to talk 
while Nicholas, who was 7 weeks old was
just beginning to focus on his hands   
and was sucking his thumb. Later we saw
Andrew who was being innoculated       
against whooping cough. The Health     
centre treates people of all ages and  
provides a vital service to the        
community.                             </content>
