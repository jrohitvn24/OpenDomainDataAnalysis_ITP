   Our town is 8 miles from {Malton}   
 and 25 miles from {York} and 18 miles 
 from {Scarborough}.We get a lot of    
 military aircraft flying over our town
 from quite a few bases in and around {
{North Yorkshire}. The nearest dock is 
 in Scarborough. There are two main    
 roads through Pickering. One is the { 
{A169}from Malton to{Whitby}and the    
 second is the {A170}from {Thirsk}to   
 Scarborough. Both cross at the Forest 
 and Vale round-about.The A169 is a    
 north-south road. The A170 is an      
 east-west road.
