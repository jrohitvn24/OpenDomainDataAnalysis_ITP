 The main concentration of housing at  
 Holt Heath is currently being swelled 
 by the building of l6 new houses and  
 bungalows on a two acre site, at      
 prices between Â£65,000 and Â£90,000    
 each. Housing generally is expensive  
 due  to the easy access to the        
 motorway network and to nearby towns. 
 Some housing lies around Holt Bridge  
 and is varied is age and style        
 A number of caravans along the banks  
 of the Severn are used as permanent   
 homes. At Dough Bank most chalets are 
 now permanent homes having been       
 brought up to modern standards.
