 I live at the Civil Service Club, and 
 it is a nice place, and my mum and dad
 are the steward and the stewardess    
 there. My garden is very big and there
 is a big sports field that I play in. 
 We hold our Sports day there.         
                                       
                                       
 For my dinner if I had packed lunch, I
 could buy my things there. And my dad 
 buys me things for school there and my
 mum helps my nan sometimes. I get some
 ice-cream sometimes. My mum and dad   
 sometimes have days off and take my   
 brothers and I out somewhere. And a   
 lot of things go on up there. Things  
 like cricket and football and rugby,  
 draws, and tennis.
