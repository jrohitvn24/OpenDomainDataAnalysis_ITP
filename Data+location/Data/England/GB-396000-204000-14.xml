		<title>14Children's Indoor Pastimes</title>
		<content>   The children have a variety of      
 indoor board games such as chess,     
 Monopoly, Scrabble, Othello and       
 draughts. These can be played when    
 they are with friends.  Otherwise,    
 they use computer games, Lego,        
 Scalectric cars, Action Man dolls for 
 boys,and Cindy dolls for girls. Some  
 enjoy using computers for more serious
 purposes, programming etc.            
                                       
   Drawing and painting, sewing and    
 knitting, model making from kits are  
 popular.  Most children spend quite a 
 lot of time watching television.      
 Children's television programmes are  
 on between 4-6 p.m.  Children's books 
 are very colourful and attractive and 
 there are still some who become       
 "bookworms" and want to do little else
 but read.
