		<content> At Calf Heath pigs and chickens are   
bred by intensive farming methods.The  
poultry are reared for eggs which are  
sold both at market and the farm shop, 
the pigs are sent for slaughter        
elsewhere.The Hollies Farm at Laney    
Green is a food production unit,rearing
one day old chicks to full grown birds.
These are killed and dressed on the    
premises then sold to butchers,        
restaurants and the general public.    
Manor House Farm at the Laches is a 70 
acre fruit farm,growing soft fruit and 
vegetables.Most fruit is sold on a     
"pick your own" basis but some pickers 
are hired and the fruit sold from the  
farm shop or to jam manufacturers.At   
the nearby garden centre several acres 
of land are planted with trees,shrubs, 
bedding plants and roses for sale to   
the public.
