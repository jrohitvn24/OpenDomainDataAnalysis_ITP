		<title>15FILKINS: EASTLEACH BUILDINGS</title>
		<content>In the private sector. 8 dwellings have
been built in stone and 5 in rendered  
construction, 4 farm buildings convert-
ed for housing and 6 for industry. Mrs 
Carter of Carterton endowed a spacious 
well-built village hall for the men but
it is now used by all. In the 1930s Sir
Stafford Cripps set up a Centre with   
hot baths, a doctor's surgery and care-
taker's flat, to be run by the Parish  
Council. A swimming pool, playground &amp; 
bowling green followed. Filkins Hall,  
rebuilt this century, is now to be con-
verted to flats.  In EASTLEACH the fine
medieval Church of St Martin is now ad-
ministered by the Redundant Churches   
Society. The 12th Century Church of St 
Andrew has a chevron carved Norman     
porch, with 'Christ in Glory' above the
door. The filled-in arches in the north
wall of the nave indicate that the     
church was once much larger.           </content>
