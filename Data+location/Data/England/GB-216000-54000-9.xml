		<content> Every week we go to Liskeard by coach 
 for{swimming lessons.}When we are     
 changed we go into the swimming pool  
 and sit on the bench.There are three  
 groups in the swimming pool.We have   
 half an hour in the pool.We do things 
 like back stroke,breast stroke,hand   
 stands,sitting on the bottom,going    
 under the water and touching the      
 bottom.Sometimes we get to do swimming
 badges when we swim as many lengths as
 we can.We also do life-saving,when we 
 wear pyjamas and swim in them.It's    
 very hard because they slip down and  
 come off.We have to dive down to the  
 bottom and pick them up.Our parents   
 pay 50p a week for each child to go,  
 (Â£1 maximum) and the P.F.T.A. pay the 
 rest. The County pays for the hire of 
 the pool.
