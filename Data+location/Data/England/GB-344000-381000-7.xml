		<content>{FLATS}In the area there are seven set 
 four story flats which have just been 
 refurbished and modernised there are  
 also some two and three story flats.  
{SEMI DETATCHED}These are mainly the   
 houses at the end of the terraced     
 blocks, although some have been made  
 from the refurbished town houses.     
{DETATCHED}There are several detatched 
 thatched houses on the land between   
 Speke and near to Hale Village, built 
 between the wars and are now listed   
 buildings.                            
{TERRACED}Most of the terraced houses  
 in Speke are corporation. Terraced    
 means that they are in a row and      
 joined together. Most of the terraced 
 town houses have been refurbished and 
 modernised by taking either the top or
 two of the three floors and making    
 them either into bungalows or groups  
 of semi detatched houses.             </content>
