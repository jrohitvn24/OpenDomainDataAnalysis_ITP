		<content> The river Witham flows south to north 
 in the west of the area. Its valley   
 floor only 50 metres above sea level  
 it is flanked by older sand and gravel
 terraces and has a wide and           
 well_marked alluvial flood plain.     
 The highest part of the area is 120   
 metres close by the High Dyke         
 road,(the old Roman Ermine street)    
 near Londonthorpe in the N.E.corner.  
 75% of the area is RURAL in this N.E. 
 zone whilst the S.W. 25% is URBAN.    
 The National Trust which protects     
 country and coastline, gardens and    
 historic buildings for the nation     
 plays an important role in this area. 
 Belton House, a late 17th century     
 stately home, and the estate park     
 close by have in recent years become  
 the responsibility of the Trust       
                                       
                                       </content>
