		<title>04Transport in Manchester</title>
		<content>  Manchester is the major regional     
 centre acting as a focus of           
 communications for much of the north  
 west. Both road and rail routes focus 
 in on the city centre and allow       
 Manchester to have a wide sphere of   
 influence.                            
  Thousands of commuters, especially   
 from south Manchester, flow into the  
 centre. This, plus the large number of
 shoppers, has meant the growth of     
 multi-storey car parks around, and in 
 some cases, within the city centre.   
 Many clearance sites have been        
 converted into car parking areas and  
 in this way bring more money into the 
 city economy.                         
  The city has an urban motorway, the  
 Mancunian Way and operates traffic    
 flow-ways at peak periods. Plans have 
 been placed for a Victoria-Piccadilly 
 station tramway link.                 </content>
