		<content> The landscape here is predominantly   
 rural with open views across the level
 plateau from Quintrell Downs towards  
 Newquay and the sea.New estates being 
 built at the edge of this resort are  
 gradually spreading towards Quintrell 
 Downs:the one now being constucted by 
 SNW (a St Austell firm) in the        
 Tretherras area.Trencreek,previously a
 hamlet with it's own identity outside 
 Newquay,is now almost  engulfed by    
 this new estate, and eventually the   
 same could happen to Quintrell Downs. 
 In the area the farmland consist      
 mainly of grass with some cereals, but
 there are still a wide variety of wild
 flowers in the hedgerows. For         
 instance, we found honeysuckle,       
 foxgloves, buttercups and pink        
 campions in the relatively unspoilt   
 area around the hamlet of Chapel.
