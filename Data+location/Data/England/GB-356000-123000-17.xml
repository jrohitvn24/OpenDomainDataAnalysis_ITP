		<content>    The Wessex Water Authority has     
 proposed a scheme designed to give    
 protection against flooding in the    
 next 50yrs                            
    Queen Camel has a weir and sluice  
 by the Old Mill shop. The sluice      
 splits the flow and some water passes 
 into Henshall Brook. Any flooding     
 initially comes from Henshall Brook , 
 but the river is already rising       
 dangerously by this time.The channel  
 along the river is to be improved and 
 localised constrictions widened,the   
 culvert under the main road  will be  
 jetted out and desilted.The weir will 
 be lowered and the masonry walling    
 next to the Old Mill will be raised in
 level.A masonry wall to be constructed
 across the river will be regulated by 
 stop logs.
