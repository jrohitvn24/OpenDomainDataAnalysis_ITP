  At school we play games like         
Football,Rounders,Tennis and Cricket.  
  Another game we play is called       
British Bulldog. You play this game    
with 11 or more players. At first 1    
player stands in a chalk circle and    
shouts,"Last one in the circle is It." 
All the others run to the other side of
the playground and start shouting,"Who 
do you want?" The person who is It     
picks someone who has 10 seconds to    
cross the playground. If he gets to the
other side without getting caught the  
others come across to join him. This   
goes on until the game has finished.   
  In Hide and Seek one person hides and
the other counts to a hundred. Then    
when he has finished counting he goes  
to find the person hiding.
