		<title>06The Afternoon at School.</title>
		<content>    After lunch break had finished we  
 all did topic work.I was writing about
 a speedwell which I found on a walk.We
 are studying plants growing in the    
 school garden.                        
    Afternoon break is at 2.15 until   
 2.30.                                 
    After break we did drama in the    
 hall where we acted out bible stories.
    When we had finished we returned to
 our classroom then I went to cello    
 lesson with Mrs. Tunnicliffe my cello 
 teacher.                              
    School finished at 3.30 when I go  
 home, but today my brother stayed for 
 cross country practice.               
    School meals cost 60 pence a day at
 our school,that's three pounds a      
 week.Swimming costs us 40 pence a     
 session.
