{Life in Long Bennington:}At 7.00am.   
 the alarm on my clock radio went off. 
 I jumped out of bed, my two brothers  
 and my sister had already eaten their 
 breakfast, I breakfasted alone. After 
 washing and dressing I helped my Mum  
 get my sister ready for Playschool. It
 took my two brothers and I fifteen    
 minutes to walk a mile to school.     </content>
