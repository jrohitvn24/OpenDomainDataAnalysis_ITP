		<content> "Granny's in the kitchen,             
 Doing a bit of stitching,             
 How many stitches did she do?         
 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, ....."         
 This is a skipping rhyme. It is sung  
 in the playground.                    
    We see all sorts of games in the   
 playground, such as football, runouts,
 kings and queens, transformers and    
 off-the-ground-touch.                 
 We asked a few school cooks what games
 were played when they were at school. 
 A game we hadn't heard of was called {
{'KEYSEY',}se we asked how to paly it. 
 You need large keys and 4 squares     
 separated. You would have to flick a  
 key into each square. If  a key is    
 already there you can flick it off the
 square with your own key.
