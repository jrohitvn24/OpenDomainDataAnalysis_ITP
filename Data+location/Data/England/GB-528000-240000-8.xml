		<content>  People in our area are worried about 
 too many new houses being             
 built,for instance,the one next to my 
 friends house,it was built exactly 1.2
 metres away from hers, with only the  
 fence dividing the two properties.The 
 house is so big that it completely    
 blocks out all the light from the     
 kitchen,also the builders are very    
 noisy what with shouting,banging and  
 loud radios.Now the area around my    
 friends house is packed with new      
 houses that there are six drive ways  
 all coming out near Cheyney Cross.    
  Up Church Farm Lane are two fields,  
 the man who owns them is always trying
 to get planning permission on them,we 
 are all concerned because the lane is 
 only 2.7 metres wide,and the average  
 car 1.9 metres wide,and quite often   
 there are lorries,trucks and Range    
 Rovers going up and down.             </content>
