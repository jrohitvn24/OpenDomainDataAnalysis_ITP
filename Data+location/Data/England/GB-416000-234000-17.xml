 friendly place and that it is         
 comfortable. She said that there      
 should be more clubs in Blockley.     
          She works in Blockley and    
 she said that generally the services  
 in Blockley were fairly good but      
 because the village has a large number
 of people that only use houses at     
 weekends the need for services is     
 getting smaller.                      
           The bus service in Blockley 
 is not as good as it used to be and   
 this is probabley because fewer       
 people live all the time in Blockley  
 and therefore don't need the service.
