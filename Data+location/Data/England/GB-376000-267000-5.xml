		<content>   {ST.PETER'S CHURCH}stands on a knoll
 dominating the surrounding area. Parts
 of the original early 12th Century    
 nave and chancel remain, mainly on the
 south side, additions and alterations 
 being made in the late 12th, 15th,    
 16th and 20th centuries.              
                                       
   Two tombs belonging to the{BLOUNT   
 family are of interest for they show  
 how the two men died. {WALTER BLOUNT, 
 who died in 1561, is shown wearing    
 armour, with a helmet under his head, 
 gauntlets by his side, a chain round  
 his neck, an open book in his hand and
 a lion at his feet. He died by the    
 sword at war. {ROBERT,}who died in    
 1573, is also in armour, but his hands
 are in an attitude of prayer and he   
 has a dog at his feet showing that he 
 died peacefully at home.
