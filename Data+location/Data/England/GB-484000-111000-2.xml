		<content> The twelve square kilometres that are 
 being covered in this 1985 Domesday   
 Project are in the South Downs.The    
 land is relatively undeveloped with   
 many farms and fields.The main        
 industries are arable,sheep and       
 forestry.There are two main villages  
 in this area,Singleton and            
 W.Dean.There are several plantations, 
 the major ones are Singletonhill,     
 Whitedown and Warren Hanger, there is 
 also an Arboretum and a Vineyard.The  
 'Trundle' tops the highest hill in the
 area,St.Roche's Hill.The hill's summit
 accomodates two disused radio masts   
 and an observatory.                   
    The main road is the A286,which    
 runs through West Dean,and East into  
 Singleton.The River Lavant flows      
 through the area and there is a Roman 
 road which runs West of the villages.
