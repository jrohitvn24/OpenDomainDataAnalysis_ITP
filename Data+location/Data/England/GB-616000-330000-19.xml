		<content>{MY HOUSE (CONT. FROM P. 18)           
  Our stairs are in our dining room and
 upstairs we have a landing,a bathroom 
 and 3 bedrooms.My bedroom has         
 magazines all over the floor and      
 posters of Nik Kershaw,Duran          
 Duran,Wham and Frankie Goes To        
 Hollywood{(all pop stars)}covering the
 wallpaper and walls.                  
     From my window you can see the    
 street and also the playing field.We  
 have a fairly big back garden with our
 dustbin and flowersin it.We have a    
 fair sizedfront garden with our drive 
 and trees in it.                      
     My dad has a blue Vauxhall and my 
 mum has a white Citroen(cars)which    
 belongs to the the person she works   
 for.My sister is an untidy wretch so  
 is my dad all my mum seems to be doing
 is tidying up after us.
