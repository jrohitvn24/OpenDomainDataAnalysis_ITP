		<content> The major feature of our area is{     
{arable farming.}The heavy clay soil   
 dictates winter wheat, winter barley  
 and oilseed rape. These crops occupy  
 over 75% of the area. Smaller areas of
 grass are largely on the steeper      
 fields around Toddington Hill. The{   
{livestock farming}is nearly all       
 fattening cattle for beef. These are  
 purchased as calves, fed grass the    
 first summer and then fattened in     
 yards during winter feeding silage,   
 hay and barley. There are small       
 numbers of ewes and lambs. One large  
 farm covers 25% of our area. They     
 employ 1 worker for every 300 acres   
 and farm large fields with a high     
 degree of mechanisation. This         
 contrasts sharply with small family   
 farms with only the owner as worker.  
 The less intensive family farm        
 disturbs the{natural environment}less.</content>
