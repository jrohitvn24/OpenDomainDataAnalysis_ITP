		<content> I HAVE BEEN REVEREND AT  ST NICHOLAS'S
 NEARLY 14 YEARS.LAST YEAR ABOUT 2000  
 TOURISTS SIGNED THE VISITORS BOOK.THE 
 TOURISTS ARE MOST IMPRESSED WITH THE  
 OLDER PARTS OF THE CHURCH.THE OLDEST  
 IS THE NAVE WITH ITS LARGE PILLARS AND
 LOW ARCHES.THE HIGHER ARCHES ARE EARLY
 ENGLISH AS AGAINST THE OLDER NORMAN   
 ARCHITECTURE.THE TOWER IS ALSO VERY   
 POPULAR,OF WHICH A GOOD HALF IS       
 NORMAN.                               
        CHANGES HAVE TAKEN PLACE MUCH  
 RESTORATION WORK ,WHILE THE TOWER     
 FOUNDATIONS HAVE BEEN                 
 SUPPORTED,SEATING IMPROVED AND THE OLD
 ELECTRIC ORGAN REPLACED.VANDALS SADLY 
 HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM SLOGANS WRITTEN,  
 ,PAINT SPRAYING, BROKEN PEW DOORS,    
 ,FIRES TO HASSOCKS AND PRAYER BOOKS.WE
 NOW ARE FORCED TO KEEP THE CHURCH     
 CLOSED WHEN IT IS NOT IN USE.
