		<content>         Methwold Market               
    There has been a market in Methwold
 since Norman times, and in those days 
 its main trade was in rabbit pelts.   
    Nowadays the market is held every  
 Monday in the Market Yard in the      
 centre of the village, and people come
 from miles around.The market sells    
 locally grown vegetables, live        
 chickens,ducks and rabbits, household 
 items, furniture, electrical goods and
 timber.                               
     On Bank Holiday Mondays there is  
 also a sale of antiques and more      
 valuable items,and on these occasions 
 a great number of people visit the    
 market.
