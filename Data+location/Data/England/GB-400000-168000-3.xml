		<title>03The Cherhill Roman Pavement</title>
		<content> The{Cherhill Roman Mosaic}was         
 discovered in 1913 but was left       
 underground and only occasionally     
 uncovered. It was completely excavated
 by{Bryan Walters}in the summer of     
{1984.                                 
                                       
 It shows two thirds of a hound, or    
 leopard, with its head missing. It is 
 believed to be{1600 years old.}The    
 whole of the mosaic measured 36ft by  
 20ft but we only have this piece left.
 This piece of mosaic is an important  
 discovery because it was made by      
 Dorset craftsmen and no other mosaics 
 of this type have been found near this
 area.                                 
                                       
 There was some controversy in the     
 village over the mosaic's future but  
 in the end it was decided to keep it  
 in {Devizes Museum.}                  </content>
