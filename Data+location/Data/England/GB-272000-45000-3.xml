		<title>03THE HAMLETS</title>
		<content>{GOVETON}and{LEDSTONE}                 
 are two small hamlets that sit snugly 
 in sheltered hollows.                 
 The population changes slightly with  
 the season but averages about 70.     
 Most of the cottages that were once   
 the homes of farm workers,blacksmiths,
 saddlers and suchlike,are now owned by
 holidaymakers,retired folk or people  
 who work elsewhere.                   
 Services are still held in the small  
 church of St.Peter which stands high  
 above Goveton and there is a small    
 Post Office/Shop in what was was once 
 the Smithy.                           
 Little of the village rural trades    
 survive.The schoolhouse is now a      
 pretty cottage and only the windows   
 betray its past as a chapel.          
 There are some visiting services such 
 as Library,Baker,Hairdresser and      
 course the Milkman.                   </content>
