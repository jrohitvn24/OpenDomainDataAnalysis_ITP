{Farming}in our area is mixed.This     
 means that there are{dairy}and{arable}
 farms which sometimes even have sheep 
 and pigs on them.Our farmers grow     
 these{crops}: wheat,barley,oats and   
 rape.The farmers start using{         
{combine-harvesters}in July and this is
 the busiest time of the year for      
 them.They make both square and round{ 
{bales}.{Silage}and hay are both made  
 for winter cattle feed and root crops 
 are grown too.Most of the{fields}have 
 to be carefully drained because of    
 numerous local springs.Most farmers do
 deep{ploughing}because of soil        
 compaction caused by heavy{tractors.  
 The use of artificial{fertilisers}has 
 been one of the greatest changes in   
 farming in recent years.{Cattle}are   
 often put on sloping fields because   
 they are difficult to plough.         </content>
