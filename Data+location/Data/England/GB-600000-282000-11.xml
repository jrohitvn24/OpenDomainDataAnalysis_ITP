		<title>11N. Lopham School, 1920's</title>
		<content>      Mrs. Potter, grandmother of      
 Michelle who described the village    
 school today, attended this school    
 approximately 1919 - 1930.  There were
 108 children in the school at that    
 time.  Mrs.  Potter did not like      
 it.  The main work was the usual      
 reading, writing and sums.  The only  
 exercise equipment was skipping ropes,
 but they did play handball.  The      
 uniform was a plain dress and apron.  
 There were no school dinners.  The    
 school building hasn't changed.  It   
 was very strict.  The cane was used   
 frequently.  It had one blue end      
 and one red.                          
      The grandfather of another school
 child, who has lived in the village   
 for 71 years, says that the village   
 and school have changed very much, but
 he thinks that life generally is      
 harder, not easier now.               </content>
