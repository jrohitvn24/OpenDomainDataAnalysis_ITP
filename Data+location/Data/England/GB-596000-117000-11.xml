		<content> Early in the morning if the weather is
 fine, my day will start with shrimping
 with my Dad. Wearing our waterproofs  
 we get the net and basket and set off 
 over the beach. It takes us about half
 an hour to get to the water and we    
 shrimp for about an hour. The basket  
 is full so we head for home strip off 
 our wet clothes,sort the shrimps and  
 cook and cool them. Then we put a sign
 out and I sell them at the door. This 
 is good fun. After dinner we all go   
 for a walk on the beach and I look for
 shells for my collection. Then I like 
 to play games on my computer. After   
 tea I read or draw. I enjoy making up 
 stories and drawing. Bedtime is the   
 part of the day I don't like but it   
 has been an exciting day.
