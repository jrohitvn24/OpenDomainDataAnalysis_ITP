		<content> The block is situated just to the     
 south of the City of Ely in           
 Cambridgeshire. Cambridge is about 12 
 miles to the south, Newmarket         
 about 15 miles to the east and London 
 75 miles to the south. The area is    
 sparsely populated containng two small
 villages Stuntney and Little Thetford 
 with a few isolated farms. The relief 
 is low lying (some areas being below  
 sea level) with just two areas of     
 'high' ground reaching about 20 metres
 above sea level. The climate is of a  
 'continental type' with warm, dry     
 summers and cold winters. The main    
 occupations in the area are           
 agriculturally based with farming     
 being the most important. Other types 
 of industry are rare.
