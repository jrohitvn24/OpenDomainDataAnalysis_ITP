		<content> One elderly resident recalls the      
 changes in his lifetime,although some 
 thatched cottages remain today there  
 were many more,including a group of 8 
 (now replaced by modern               
 bungalows).Perhaps the single biggest 
 impact on the village has been the    
 increase in traffic along the A 422.  
 Pre war, flocks of sheep and cattle   
 were driven along the road. The       
 majority of the village was           
 self-supporting, keeping poultry and  
 pigs for there own use and tending 20 
 pole allotments despite working long  
 hours on the farm. 2 of the allotment 
 areas were called New Zealand and Van 
 Diemans. People knew what you meant if
 you said you were going to New Zealand
 for the evening! Half the allotment   
 was vegetables, half wheat,which      
 together with gleanings would provide 
 the family with flour.                </content>
