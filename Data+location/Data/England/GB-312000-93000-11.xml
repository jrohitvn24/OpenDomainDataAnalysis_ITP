 occupation within the block. However

 vital to the survival of some farms.  
 Higher Knapp Farm (152949) offers{Bed 
{and Breakfast}and in the summer runs a
{caravan site}on one of its fields.    
 There is also a temporary Caravan Club
 site near Magpie Cottage (144942).    
 Bernard's farm (143933) has been      
 partly converted to a{Hotel and

   The large private houses provide    
 much local employment for gardeners   
 and odd job men. The woodland must    
 also provide some employment however  
 many people will{commute}out of the   
 block to jobs in nearby towns.  The   
 closure of Sidmouth town tip at Lower 
 Knapp is the most recent job losses to
 the block.
