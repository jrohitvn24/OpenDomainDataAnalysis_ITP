		<title>13CHILHAM CASTLE-JOUSTING</title>
		<content> Jousting is carried out in the grounds
 of Chilham Castle.This is what the    
 performance is like.There are two     
 teams.One is the Black Knight's team  
 and the other is another leading      
 team.They each have a tent opposite   
 the other.There is a fence down the   
 middle.Near the fence is a man dressed
 up as Henry VIII and a woman dressed  
 up as his wife.Then he tells the two  
 jousters to start. They ride down     
 opposite sides of the fence and try to
 knock the other off their horses with 
 their lances.If their lance hits the  
 other person's shield they get some   
 points,but if they knock their        
 oppponent off their horse more points 
 are gained.Many people visit Chilham  
 Castle to see the jousting            
 tournaments.
