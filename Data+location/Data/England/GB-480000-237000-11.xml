		<title>11GOING  SWIMMING</title>
		<content> Every Saturday I go to Bletchly       
 swimming pool,it has a wave machine   
 and a slide, you have to be careful   
 because you might bang your head on   
 the end.In the swimming pool they have
 Palm trees in the middle,and they have
 a bar so when you get out you can sit 
 at the table and chairs and have a    
 drink.You can have a very luxurious   
 time and after you can go to park.The 
 park has a pond or you can stand on   
 the bridge and look over Bletchly.You 
 can see the cinema and the market and 
 lots of shop and supermarkets and all 
 the birds that fly over the bridge.The
 bridge is like a long tunnel.My Mum   
 and I go there a lot and the water is 
 as warm as a bath.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
