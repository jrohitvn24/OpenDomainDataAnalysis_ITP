		<content>  The Balfour Beatty site              
 offices,storage dept and temporary    
 housing site for its construction     
 workers is in South Mimms and the     
 large plant used in construction is a 
 daily sight on local roads.The        
 builders are careful to keep mud pff  
 the roads as this could be a          
 hazard.Road sweepers as well as       
 road-side wheel cleaning devices are  
 situated around the site              
 Before building the motorway the area 
 had to be levelled and the company    
 expected to move about 6000000m3 of   
 earth to make cuttings and            
 embankments.Drains have also had to be
 laid to carry away water which could  
 cause subsidence later.Only then can  
 the various layers of the motorway's  
 foundations be laid and the final     
 'black top' of tarmac be put down.
