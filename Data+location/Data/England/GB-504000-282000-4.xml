		<content>        Bright Pitts Farm              
                                       
 Mr. Roughton has 2 Mercedes, 2 John   
Deer, 2 Ford and a Massey tractor and  
farms about 590 acres. He sprays the   
fields using Unimogs and has one person
working for him called Fred. Mr.       
Roughton grows winter wheat, barley,   
oil seed rape, spring beans and oats.  
Half the winter wheat is used for      
animal feed (going to Dodson &amp; Horrell)
and half for breadmaking. Winter barley
goes for feed and malting (Horlicks &amp;  
malt bread). The crops are rotated at  
the end of every year. He has two      
horses and a very big Massey tractor   
and a combine. He uses three barns with
straw and hay in them. He gets up      
about 7:15am but it depends on the     
time of year and what the weather is   
like.
