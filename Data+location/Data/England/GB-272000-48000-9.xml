		<content> The survey area is just far enough    
 away from the sea to escape from being
 dominated by tourism, but it certainly
 has its impact.                       
 Many of the farms and houses well     
 situated for the passing traffic offer
 Bed and Breakfast. Some properties    
 have been converted for the holiday   
 trade for holiday lettings. In high   
 summer caravans can be seen in some   
 fields, but it is at The Mounts that  
 the only real camping and caravan     
 site, with full facilities, is to be  
 found, alongside the busy Totnes to   
 Kingsbridge road.                     
 Many people seem to prefer the rather 
 quieter inland to the busy coastal    
 area further to the south; there are  
 fewer crowds and the village life is  
 still comparatively unaffected, while 
 there is the beautiful wooded Avon    
 valley for walks and relaxation.      </content>
