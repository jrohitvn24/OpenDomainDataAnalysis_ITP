		<content> Laoder's Garage, Bashley, is owned and
 run by Mr John Loader. The business   
 was started by his father, his        
 grandfather was for many years the    
 village blacksmith. Five people work  
 at the garage including Mr Loader and 
 one of his sons. Mrs Loader helps     
 whenever she can. The garage sells    
 Shell petrol. Servicing, repairs and  
 M.O.T.'s are carried out on vehicles  
 belonging mainly to local people.     
 During the summer a lot of tourists   
 pass through the area and this brings 
 in some extra trade. Mr and Mrs Loader
 live in the village with their five   
 children in a three bedroomed house.  
 The house has gas fired central       
 heating and a log burning stove. Mrs  
 Loader takes the two youngest children
 to school each day in New Milton. Mr  
 and Mrs Loader are founder members of 
 the Bashley '6'.                      </content>
