		<title>04HARESBY LONNEN,HAYDON BRIDGE</title>
		<content> The land was originally used as{Common
{land}for the villagers of Haydon      
 Bridge. In the late nineteenth century
 the land was enclosed &amp; fenced &amp; a    
 track built allowing access to the    
 fields. Today,to the south side of    
 the track the land is farmed by Mr.J. 
 Wardle &amp; on the north by Mr.Pigg up to
 Pit Covert.   The fields on the south 
 side are well- drained &amp; fertile &amp; are
 used for{beef &amp; sheep grazing}&amp; for   
 silage &amp; hay. In one of the grazing   
 fields an area of{spruce}has been     
 planted, giving shelter to grazing    
 animals. On the north side of the     
 track the land is very rough &amp; wet; it
 is only suitable for a few sheep &amp;    
 some hardy beef cattle. There is also 
 a sheep dip on the north side of the  
 track used twice a year to protect    
 sheep from lice and ticks.
