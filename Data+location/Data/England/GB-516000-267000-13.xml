		<title>13Herb Growing in Buckden</title>
		<content> The Hoo is a large house surrounded by
 gardens covering half an acre, owned  
 by Mr. and Mrs. Peplow. It has become 
 recognised as a centre for herb       
 cultivation. The business started from
 the selling of vegetables on the      
 doorstep, of which herbs becaame a    
 part and soon the main attraction. Mr.
 Peplow is now the Administrator of the
 British Herb Association and he and   
 his wife have written several books.  
  One and a half workers are now       
 employed in the office and garden.    
 People write to the Hoo for special   
 cultivation packs or information      
 sheets and sometimes day courses are  
 held. The grounds include several show
 gardens such as the Agatha Christie   
 garden full of poisonous herbs and    
 another with herbs from the bible.    
  The most popular herb sold is an     
 insect repellent called Penny Royal.  </content>
