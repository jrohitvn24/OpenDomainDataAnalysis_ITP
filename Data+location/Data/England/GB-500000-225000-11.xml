		<content>{SECONDARY TREATMENT.}BIOLOGICAL       
 FILTERATION. The biological treatment 
 is where sewage is passed through a   
 circular or triangular tank which     
 contains rocks and stones.Mother      
 nature takes control of this process. 
 The plant allows fresh air to         
 circulate and small flies to feed on  
 the sewage. This cleans some of the   
 sewage. Bacteria covers the rocks and 
 feed.                                 
{TERTIARY TREATMENT.}At Charlton the   
 flow of sewage is then passed through 
 large fields of grass to remove any   
 remaining solids. If the sewage plant 
 is large enough then the flow of the  
 water should be in a clear liquid     
 sparkling form. This is then          
 discharged into rivers were it is used
 for pond life and wildlife. Finally it
 finds it way back into the water      
 system.                               </content>
