		<title>07SICKLINGHALL VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content>   The idea of a village hall in       
 Sicklinghall was first thought of by a
 Mr. Fryer in May 1945. It was not     
 until 1952 that the hall was completed
 at a cost of Â£3,500 (Â£1,500 of which  
 was raised by the villagers through   
 jumble-sales, Â£1,000 was donated by   
 Mr. G.R.Foster and Â£1,000 was received
 from the Ministry of Education). It   
 was officially opened in 1953.        
                                       
  The hall is managed by a committee of
 local people and provides a wide range
 of activities, including whist drives,
 darts, dominoes, snooker and dancing. 
 It is hoped to extend the range of    
 activities to include a youth club,   
 drama group and adult evening classes.
 The village hall is an important      
 feature of the village as it          
 represents a focal point where young  
 and old can meet.                     </content>
