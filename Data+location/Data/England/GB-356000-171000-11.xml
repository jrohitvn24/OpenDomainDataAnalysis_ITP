		<title>11Children's Games in Bristol</title>
		<content> The games we play at school in Bristol
 are rounders, cricket, football and   
 netball.  Also we go swimming once a  
 week on Tuesdays.  We play games on   
 Thursdays. Sometimes we go to the     
 games fields. The girls play rounders 
 in the summer and netball in the      
 winter. The boys play football in the 
 winter and baseball and cricket in the
 summer.  Sometimes I play cricket     
 after school and also French skipping 
 which is played with a long length of 
 elastic. Here are some names of the   
 games - Ibble Obble Black Bobble,     
 Jingle Jangle, Granny put her knickers
 on, and England, Ireland, Scotland,   
 Wales. For Jingle Jangle you jump in  
 and out of the elastic, either 1 foot 
 at a time, or both feet together and  
 sometimes you stand on the elastic.
