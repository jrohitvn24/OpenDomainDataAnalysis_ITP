		<content>   The school belongs to the Downs     
 Federation of small Primary Schools,  
 all of which normally pass on their   
 leavers to he Downs Secondary School  
 at Compton.  The Federation organises 
 Potted Sports in the summer for all   
 the schools to take part. This year   
 the first and second years went to    
 Hermitage, and the third and fourth   
 years to Chieveley.  It also arranges 
 a "Work Week" or school trip for the  
 third and fourth years.  This was at  
 Fairthorne Manor near Hamble in       
 Hampshire.  It was an activities week 
 in which we had a go at canoeing,     
 archery, rock-climbing, orienteering, 
 the assault courseand the death slide.
   We also visited a country museum and
 H.M.S. Victory.  Ten children went    
 from Yattendon, four fourth years and 
 all but one of the third years.
