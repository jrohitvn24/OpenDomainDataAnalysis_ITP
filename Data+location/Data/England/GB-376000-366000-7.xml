		<title>07RICHARD'S DAY</title>
		<content> I normally wake at about 7.25 a.m. and
 after washing and dressing, I go      
 downstairs for breakfast; grapefruit, 
 toast and coffee.  At 8.40 a.m. my    
 mother drives me to school, where I   
 play football until going in at 9.00  
 a.m.  During the first half of the    
 morning I am involved with mathematics
 and reading and, after break, in topic
 work.  Lunchtime is from noon until   
 1.15 p.m.  I always have my packed    
 meal during that time before going out
 to play if the weather is fine.       
 During the afternoon I do art and some
 written work, and later on P.E.  At   
 3.45 p.m. my mum comes and takes me   
 home.  I then change into some        
 different clothes and play on my      
 computer.  At 6 p.m. I have my tea.   
 Then I read my reading book and       
 practice my musical instruments.  I   
 have a shower and go to bed.          </content>
