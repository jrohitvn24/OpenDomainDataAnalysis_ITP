		<content> THE GT.YARMOUTH STADIUM               
   To every meeting there are 8 races. 
 There have been about 5000 races since
 they first opened. George Formby      
 used to be interested in Speedway so  
 is Lady Somerleyton and Charlie       
 Chester. The East Anglian Derby,held  
 for 38 years, has a visiting celebrity
 such as Billy Moore, Henry Cooper and 
 Geoff Boycott.                        
   Stock Car Racing has the most people
 attend as it is more a family affair  
 than greyhound racing.                
   In 1974 a new stadium was built with
 fireproof materials. The older stadium
 contained timber. Probably, a wise    
 precaution in view of the recent fire 
 disaster at the Bradford City Football
 ground.
