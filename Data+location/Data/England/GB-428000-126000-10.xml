 disease. To prevent these the sheep   
 have two compulsory dips a year.      
 The chief items of machinery are ten  
 tractors and two large combine        
 harvesters. The farm grows wheat,     
 barley and hay for their own animals. 
                                       
 We visited Dean Hill Barn Farm on     
 Monday 15th July. This is a farm for  
 beef production. The farmer buys      
 Fresian Bulls and Limousin steers     
 because they are best suited to his   
 system. Barley is grown on the farm   
 for the cattle and harvested, dried   
 and rolled on site. In winter cattle  
 are fed on silage stored in the middle
 of their winter quarters. Their       
 feeding is controlled by an electric  
 fence. The bulls are kept inside,     
 never allowed to graze. The steers are
 strip grazed using an electric fence. </content>
