		<content> In the central part of the eastern    
 cliffs are the old granite quarries.  
 In 1865,when they were opened,they    
 gave employment to more than 200      
 people.                               
 Further N.is Tibbets Point-the second 
 highest point on the island and site  
 of an old Admiralty lookout.          
 The island is quartered(rather        
 unfairly!) by 3 east/west walls and   
 the track running north through the   
 centre of the island is marked        
 throughout its length by large blocks 
 of granite.                           
 In the S.W.the Old Light stands on the
 island's highest point.Despite its    
 height it was often obscured by fog   
 and from 1863 to 1897 warnings were   
 fired from the Battery which is down  
 the cliffs to the north. Nearby is the
 Earthquake and north again the Devil's
 Slide -popular with rock climbers.    </content>
