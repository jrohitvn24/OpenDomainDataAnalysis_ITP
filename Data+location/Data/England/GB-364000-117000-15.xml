		<content> Parts ofthe Parish Church of{St.John  
{the Evangelist}are pre 1066 and are of
 Saxon origin.The design is the        
 traditional cruciform shape and there 
 is a fine tower.                      
 There are services every day of the   
 week with four on Sundays attendances 
 vary from a mere handful on weekdays  
 to full capacity,300,for the monthly  
 Family Services.                      
 Although the church is Anglican there 
 are regular united services with other
 denominations.The Roman Catholics in  
 the area do not have their own        
 building and so use the Parish Church 
 on a regular basis.                   
 The Vicar of the Parish Church is a   
 member of the School Governors and    
 close ties are still maintained       
 despite the closure of the Church     
 School.                               
                                       </content>
