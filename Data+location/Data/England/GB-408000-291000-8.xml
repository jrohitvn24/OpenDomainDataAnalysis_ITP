		<title>08LANGUAGE SURVEY ERDINGTON</title>
		<content> The main language at home is English  
 other languages spoken by people in   
 our class include French and German.  
 At home some family members speak     
 Gaelic, Welsh and Arabic.  In the     
 street survey most people thought it  
 important to speak different          
 languages.  Only a small percentage   
 spoke more than one foreign language -
 usually French or Gaelic.  Most people
 came across foreign language speakers 
 in their daily life-speakers of       
 Italian, Gaelic and Hindi in          
 Birmingham.  There are many dialect   
 words, e.g. Wally means idiot-Granny  
 basher means an unfashionable         
 person-dosser is someone who does no  
 work-duranies are Duran Duran fans and
 Brummies are people who live in       
 Birmingham.
