		<title>15NETHERTON CHAPEL</title>
		<content> Netherton Chapel,now a ruin,was built 
 in the late twelfth century.It is of  
 interest architecturally and is       
 maintained in its present condition by
 the farmer on whose land it stands.The
 north doorway of the nave is a fine   
 example of Norman craftmanship.The    
 arch with heeled jam shafts with      
 carved capitals is of two orders      
 externally,the outer with chevron and 
 lozenge.There is a carved tympanum    
 which stood over the south door.The   
 east window,a sigle light with a      
 cusped head and ribbed arch is        
 believed to be thirteenth century;so  
 too is the lancet between the two     
 windows in the south wall.Rebates can 
 be seen for shutters.There is a plain,
 narrow round-headed light probably    
 from an earlier chapel.
