		<content> To cook school dinners there is 1 cook
 and 9 Kitchen Assistants. There are   
 about 10 ladies who clean the school, 
 and two caretakers.                   
     Children join the nursary school  
 when they are 3 or 4 ,and begin coming
 for half the day.                     
  At 5 they join the First Department  
 and the Middle Department is for      
 children aged 8_12.                   
     Children leave at 12 to go        
 to secondary school.                  
                                       
     These pages were written and typed

 out by children from this school and  
 Bluestones Middle School.
