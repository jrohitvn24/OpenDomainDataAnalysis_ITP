		<content>      Flowers are mostly confined to   
 the road verges as farmers use        
 weedkillers in the fields. All through
 the year from the Spring primroses and
 bluebells to the Autumn teasles there 
 is a carpet of colourfull wild flowers
 along the wide verges.                
     {    Animals.                     
      Rabbits abound in every bank some
 of which are caught by foxes, stoats  
 and weasles. Badgers also burrow in   
 the banks and more prolific are the   
 rats, mice, voles, moles and          
 fieldmice. Mink are now endemic as    
 there is plenty of food if they escape
 from a mink farm. They are found by   
 streams and are a menace as they kill 
 domestic chickens and ducks.          
      Birds are abundant and the       
 seasons see the changes as some       
 migrate to warmer places for Winter   
 and some return from the colder North.</content>
