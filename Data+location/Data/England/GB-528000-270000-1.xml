		<content> This block straddles the river Ouse   
 which is like a spine flowing roughly 
 from West to East. The river has      
 always moulded the character of the   
 area, sometimes as a means of         
 transport or a source of power for    
 mills but now as a leisure resource   
 for fishing and boating. The          
 buildings in the area reflect this,   
 representing Tudor thatch to the      
 modern boat marina. The industry today
 is light, such as printing, packaging 
 and plastics. Some of it is connected 
 with hi-tech electronics. There is    
 also a great increase in the number of
 people commuting to London and        
 Cambridge as road and rail services   
 have developed. The area is           
 becoming a cross roads for many major 
 trunk routes but St Ives cattle market
 has gone. All this reflects the vast  
 social changes taking place.          </content>
