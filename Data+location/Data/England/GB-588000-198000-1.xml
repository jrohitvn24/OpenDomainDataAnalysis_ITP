		<title>01LATCHINGDON   PART 1</title>
		<content>  Latchingdon is a fairly small village
 which is built along the main street  
 although there has been some          
 development in recent years.The Street
 is the main road to the rest of the   
 Dengie Peninsula and lots of traffic  
 uses it. We did a survey and found    
 that 4376 cars and 616 lorries passed 
 the the school between 8.30 a.m. and  
 3.30 p.m.That is 624 cars per hour and
 87 lorries,on average. Although the   
 school is in Latchingdon,many of our  
 children live in Maylandsea, which has
 a lot of houses but few places to     
 work. We asked our parents where they 
 worked and found that 16 worked       
 locally but many more travelled to    
 different parts of Essex e.g.8 to     
 Maldon,10 to Basildon,3 to Southend,4 
 to South Woodham Ferrers,4 to London  
 and indivdual people to places like   
 Chelmsford,Harlow,Grays and Wickford. </content>
