		<title>05A DAY IN CLASS 1W</title>
		<content>  When the whistle went we ran inside  
 and took our coats off. We took our   
 bags to the classroom in case anything
 got stolen. We talked until teacher   
 came, then had to get our books out.  
 We had register then Mr. Wright told  
 us what was going to happen that day. 
 At assembly we had a story, prayers   
 and club notices. Then we did various 
 bits of work. We did graphs. It was   
 fun. At playtime some of us grabbed a 
 bat and ball and played cricket. Then 
 it was back to work. At midday we all 
 stampeded downstairs and rushed to get
 our bags. We ate dinner quickly to get
 out to play. Some of us played        
 cricket. The others won but we didn't 
 care. We did poetry, model making and 
 music in the afternoon. After playtime
 Mr. Wright read us a story and we drew
 a picture. At hometime we put our     
 chairs up, said goodbye and ran home. </content>
