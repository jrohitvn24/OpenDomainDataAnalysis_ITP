		<content> School Work:-                         
 The{art work}in all the schools has   
 been superb, with huge models of      
{"Morning Star", "Iron Duke"}and other 
 famous broad gauge locomotives, models
 of the{Great Eastern, Great Western   
 and{Great Britain,}attempts to build a
 model of the{Clifton Suspension Bridge
 and even the{Box Tunnel.              
 There have been paintings, sketchings,
 collages, photographs, rubbings,      
 maps..... Costumes have been excellent
 and many plays about these events have
 been incorporated in school           
{assemblies.                           
 A major source of information came    
 from a{Quest computer program}with all
 the information about the people who  
 lived in the{Railway Village in 1845, 
 taken from the{National Census}of     
 1845.
