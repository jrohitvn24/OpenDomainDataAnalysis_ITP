		<title>04GUNTON St.PETER'S CHURCH</title>
		<content>The most striking feature of the church
is without doubt its round tower.Many  
such-like towers were built by the     
Saxons to protect them from the        
marauding norsemen.There are believed  
to be only 174 in the country,160 of   
which are to be found in Norfolk and   
Suffolk.The tower was built with a     
narrow arched opening suggesting that  
the tower was used as a sanctuary from 
the norsemen.The tower was built in    
12ft. high sections,each layer settling
before another was added.The walls are 
5ft. thick,circular on the outside, and
square on the inside.The first church  
at Gunton was probably Norman and built
of wood,this being replaced later by a 
stone building.
