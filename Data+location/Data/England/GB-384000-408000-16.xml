 The{Heywood Fire Station}is the       
 nearest station to the{M62.}It has the
 best trained men and equipment for    
{motorway accidents.}They have two     
 general purpose fire engines and a    
 special landrover which is used in    
 motorway accidents, mostly for{rescue}
 purposes. It has a winch, saws,       
 drills, and first aid equipment. It   
 also has a 20ft telescopic stem light 
 which makes it as light as day in a   
 30ft radius around the landrover. All 
 the tools in the landrover are run by 
 electricity, manual power, pneumatic  
 or hydraulic power.                   
   On the motorway firemen have a lot  
 of power, they can drive up           
 embankments or drive the wrong way and
 do U-turns, if the situation calls for
 these actions. Their biggest problems 
 are lack of water and exposure.       </content>
