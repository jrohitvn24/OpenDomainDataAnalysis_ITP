		<title>08Laleham Burway &amp; Gravel Pits</title>
		<content> Just upstream of Chertsey Bridge is   
 found Laleham Burway. There is a large
 recreational area on the East bank of 
 the river which includes a camp and   
 caravan site, a large picnic area     
 (with a shop), and car parking        
 facility. Further north is a canoe    
 clubhouse. On the opposite bank of the
 river is Chertsey Water works and     
 pumping station.                      
 East of the camp site there are       
 man-made gravel pits. The pits are    
 gradually being filled in by people   
 wanting to dump hardcore. They are    
 used for recreational purposes        
 including fishing, wind surfing, water
 skiing, canoeing, scuba diving and    
 sailing. These pits can be dangerous  
 as the banks crumble. Swimmers and    
 divers should not be there alone.
