		<content>  Interview with site manager,Mr Finlay
 it is a well paid job and for some of 
 the men a large amount is earned.It   
 will help the traffic in the area.For 
 the twenty or so men and the five     
 vehicles,it will take about eighteen  
 months to finish.It is a long job each
 day most men work eleven and a-half   
 hours.The most difficult job is       
 digging holes for the flyover.They    
 didn't have a license for driving an  
 earth mover and there is no easy way  
 to build the flyover .Hopefully it    
 will be finished by Christmas 1985    
 although the heavy rain has caused    
 delays.At the moment the flyover has  
 no effect on the school,but when it is
 in use it will will be noisy and dusty
 so the local people believe.
