		<title>08MAIDENHALL FARM ESTATE 1</title>
		<content>   The estate is located 3 miles from  
 Gloucester.The A40 trunk road,south of
 Highnam,runs from Gloucester to       
 Ross-on-Wye and a duel carriage way   
 puts Maidenhall Farm within minutes of
 the city.A regular 'bus service       
 connects the estate with Gloucester   
 and Newent.The estate is well placed  
 as regards the national road network, 
 having good access to the M5 motorway,
 and London via the M4 and M40.        
   The estate layout is designed to    
 blend into its rural setting.The      
 houses,all detached,are spaced out    
 along short,curved branch roads,many  
 ending in cul-de-sacs.Each house has  
 been assigned an average sized plot of
 land and access by car is via each    
 cul-de-sac.No homes front onto the    
 main estate road,and few front direct-
 ly onto the main service road.
