		<content>  Except within the village of         
 Withington all housing is very        
 scattered, being mostly built as      
{farms, cottages and smallholdings.}The
 number of original farm houses totals 
 about 36, but only half of these are  
 working farms today, and three are    
 market gardens. The remaining,        
 together with some farm cottages and  
 smallholdings, a chapel and the old   
 school, have been purchased by        
 professional people wanting{a home in 
{the country.}Such former farms often  
 retain 8 or 9 acres for keeping horses
 or a few sheep while the rest of the  
 land is sold or rented to nearby      
 farmers.                              
  In Withington village there are      
 approximatly 24{council built         
 dwellings including some 6 bungalows  
 for the elderly. In Catchpenny Lane   
 there are 18 council built houses,    </content>
