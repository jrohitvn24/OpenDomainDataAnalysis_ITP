        ____________________           
     I get up at 7.30 a.m..First of all
 I get my clothes out  then I go across
 to see if my mum is awake. Next  I  go
 downstairs to watch television.  About
 half an hour later, I get dressed  and
 then I  have  my  breakfast. I usually
 have toast and a drink of coffee. When
 I get to school, I play football until
 it is time  to start school.  First we
 have assembly and  then  we  do  Maths
 until playtime at 10.40..After play,we
 do English.  We  play  football  after
 dinner.At 3.30 I go home.I might go to
 the shop to buy a few sweets.  Later I
 go down to Shaun  Spencer's  house. We
 go out training until about 9'o clock.
 Then  I  watch  television  for  a bit
 before having a bath and  cleaning  my
 teeth and going to bed.Last of all,  I
 set the alarm  on  my  watch for 7.30.</content>
