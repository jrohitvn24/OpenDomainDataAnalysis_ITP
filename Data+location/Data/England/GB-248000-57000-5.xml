		<content> People walk and play in woods but,    
 unfortunately, some damage is         
 sometimes caused.Many people are      
 worried about the future of our       
 woodlands.The National Trust and The  
 Woodland Trust are buying and         
 conserving woods for the public.Many  
 new woods consist of coniferous trees 
 which cannot support as much wildlife 
 as deciduous woodlands.Trees like     
 Oak, Ash and Beech are not being grown
 because they take too long to grow for
 a quick profit.                       
 There are Badgers and Foxes living in 
 Whitleigh woods and they make trails  
 along the woodland floor.Grey         
 Squirrels are common and cause much   
 damage to trees.                      
 Some of us think, that in the future, 
 housing will take the place of all our
 woodland but we hope this will not    
 happen.                               </content>
