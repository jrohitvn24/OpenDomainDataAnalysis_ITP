		<title>08Conservation -  Olton Mere</title>
		<content> Oltone Mere, previously called Olton  
 Reservoir, is owned by British        
 Waterways and is a conservation area. 
 Many species of fish and water birds  
 inhabit the lake, while the           
 surrounding woods with their dense    
 undergrowth, streams and bog, provide 
 rare breeding grounds for creatures   
 under pressure such as the frog. When 
 trees fall they are left to decay     
 naturally, soon becoming home for many
 species of insect and fungus. Olton   
 Mere is a man made lake, said to have 
 been dug out by Napoleonic prisoners  
 of war around 1795. There were        
 however, 20000 Irish navies there at  
 the time building the canal. The Mere 
 was made waterproof by puddling.      
 Mixing a paste of clay, sand and water
 and treading it down in layers. A     
 private sailing club uses the lake but
 their chief concern is conservation.  </content>
