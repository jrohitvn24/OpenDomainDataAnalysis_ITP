		<title>14A FARMERS DAY</title>
		<content> A dairy farmer's day begins early.The 
 cows are brought in from the fields at
 6:30am to be milked.This takes about  
 2\ hours,to milk and to clean the     
 milking parlour and wash and sterilise
 the equipment.Then it is breakfast    
 time .If there are any calves to be   
 taken to market,the farmer puts       
 numbered tags into their ears and     
 loads them into the calf trailer.After
 he comes back from the cattle market  
 he looks at the cows to see whether   
 any calves are due to be born.If so   
 ,the cow is brought into a loose box  
 so that it is warm,dry and clean.     
 Normally the cow will calve on her    
 own with out any problems.The rest of 
 the morning is spent talking to sales 
 men,dealing with bills and recording  
 the amount of milk the cows produce.  
 After lunch most of the field work is 
 such as spreading fertilizer,ploughing</content>
