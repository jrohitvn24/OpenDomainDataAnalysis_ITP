		<title>09LEISURE SURVEY</title>
		<content> A survey was held to find out how     
 children and their parents spend their
 leisure time. About 200 families from 
 Crossways Junior School took part.    
 1. Television viewing is very popular 
 with a vast majority watching T.V.    
 every day.                            
 2. One third of the sample use the    
 local sports centre on at least a     
 weekly basis while only 11% never use 
 it.                                   
 3. Over half of the families regularly
 take part in outdoor exercise varying 
 from jogging to football.             
 4. The local library is not so        
 popular. 26% use it regularly but as  
 many as 16% never use it at all.      
 5. Many children play in the street.  
 70% of junior children do so daily    
 while secondary children no longer    
 choose to do so. Young children are   
 not allowed to play in the street.    </content>
