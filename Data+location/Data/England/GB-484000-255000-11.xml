		<title>11    Yardley Chase</title>
		<content> Yardley Hastings is surrounded by the 
remains of the forests of old England. 
In the 12th.century all woods were     
classified as 1)forests owned by the   
Crown and where the harsh forest laws  
applied,2)the Chases where the King    
granted hunting rights to a local Lord 
and where only a few of the forest     
laws were applied and 3)the Parks or   
enclosed areas where none of the       
forest laws were applied Yardley Chase 
has been leased to the Forestry        
Commision since approximatly 1930 and  
along with the neighbouring Salcey     
Forest ,which remained a Crown forest, 
have been managed under the old        
Domesday name for the area as          
{Wymersley Forest}.The Chase is famous 
for its oak trees,{Cowpers oak} which  
had a girth of 22.5 feet,and the much  
larger{ Gog and Magog oaks},of which   
only one still exists.                 </content>
