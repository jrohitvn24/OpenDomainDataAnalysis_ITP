		<content> The 1944 Education Act stated that    
 multi_handicapped blind children      
 should receive a better education .   
 Following this,Condover Hall was      
 opened as a school for such children  
 in 1947,by the RNIB (Royal National   
 Institute for the Blind).Later in 1952
 a new'Deaf Blind'unit known as        
 "Pathways"was added,and extra houses  
 were built to house the blind children
 in 1959.Later in 1970,8 new family    
 units were opened by HRH Princess     
 Margaret.The duty teachers at the     
 blind school start work at 7.00 am and
 finish at 10.15 pm daily.They help the
 blind children wash, dress and eat.   
 There is a special lift to get the    
 children into the bath . Children come
 from all over the British Isles       
 between the ages of 13 and 20.There   
 are now approx. 100 pupils.
