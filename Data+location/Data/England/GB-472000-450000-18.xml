		<title>18WILBERFOSS NEW ARRIVALS</title>
		<content>   In Wilberfoss there is much new     
 housing and there are always "For     
 sale" and "Sold" signs to be seen.    
 Most people who have moved into the   
 village have come because of job      
 changes or promotion. Few newcomers   
 have come here to retire.They all     
 seem to like it here in the country   
 and say how quiet and peaceful it is. 
 They also mention how friendly people 
 in the village are. Many mentioned    
 how useful the new extended village   
 shop is for most of their household   
 needs, although most did their main   
 weekly shopping at supermarkets in    
 York or Pocklington.                  
   Families have come from many parts  
 of the country, Doncaster, Durham,    
 Norwich and Berkshire to name but 4.  
  At present there are 4 building      
 companies erecting housing in the     
 village, but land is getting scarce.  </content>
