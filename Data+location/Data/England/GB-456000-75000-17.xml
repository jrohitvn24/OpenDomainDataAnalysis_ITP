 Richard Smith provided the money to   
 build the Church of Our Lady and St.  
 Wilfred which was completed in 1872.  
 It was built by Dan Day of Bonchurch. 
 It seats approx. 200 people and about 
 136 people attend the two services on 
 a Sunday. The priest, Father Richard  
 Davey is also responsible for St.     
 Joseph's Church, Niton, and his parish
 extends 8 miles to the west and 4     
 miles to the north. The organist Mrs. 
 Kenny is 93 years old and has been    
 organist for 60 years. The church has 
 no Sunday School but St. Wilfred's    
 Primary School belongs to it and they 
 share a hall. There is a youth group  
 of 16. The church raises money through
 collections, covenants, fetes and     
 coffee mornings. It sends Â£1,000 a    
 year to charities.
