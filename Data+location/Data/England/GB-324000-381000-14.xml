		<title>14OUR LADY &amp; ST.JOHN'S CHURCH</title>
		<content> The Catholic Church in Heswall is     
 dedicated to Our Lady and Saint John. 
 The church was built in 1939 and the  
 first parish priest was Fr. Russell.  
 Since then there have been six parish 
 priests. The church holds 320 people  
 and the number of people in theparish 
 is 1560.  Before the church was built,
 the people who lived around here had  
 to go to Neston to Mass. The parish   
 priest today is Fr. Joseph Carney.    
 Last year Fr. Carney had a new organ  
 installed in the church. It is a full 
 pipe organ and was built by Willis the
 organ builders.
