		<title>08ROAD MAINTENANCE DEPOT</title>
		<content> There is a Hampshire County Council   
 road depot next to Hounsdown School.  
 The site was opened as a road depot in
 the mid nineteen thirties. It covers  
 an area of six acres. Twenty four men 
 work there eight hours a day. The     
 grit, gravel, salt and other equipment
 is supplied to the depot by the       
 Department of the Environment. This   
 particular depot covers most of South 
 West Hampshire and in one day, five   
 trucks carrying twenty tons of salt or
 gravel or grit unload.                
 During the winter extra men are hired 
 if the weather is bad. The road depot 
 is also responsible for grass cutting 
 on the road verges as well as school  
 playing fields and public parks. Most 
 of the area is used for storage but   
 there are offices, machine sheds,     
 workshops and garages on the site.
