		<content>"The Masque of Athers Tun"was written  
by 4th year children for a national    
"Make a Masque" competition.The        
characters were ficticious, but the    
ballad was based on historical fact.   
The story told of a mediaeval masque   
prented by villeins of the Manors of   
Athers Tun and Wytheley,before the     
victorious King Henry V11 and his Queen
Elizabeth of York, to celebrate their  
visit to Athers Tun in the spring 1486.
In the masque the villeins told of     
their lives in feudal England,ruled    
over by Lord Thomas Carlyon.The        
allegory of the farmyard battle touched
on the struggle for power between      
church and commerce,while the battle   
depicted the Battle of Bosworth.       
Presented before their Royal Highnesses
the Prince and Princess of Wales and   
dignitaries.June 27th 1985.
