		<title>05Bridgnorth's Town Hall</title>
		<content> Bridgnorth Town Hall is situated in   
 the centre of the High Street and was 
 originally a barn at Much Wenlock -   
 being moved early in the l7th. century
 and erected on stilts so that traffic 
 is able to travel underneath. Ancient 
 Charters enable the townspeople to    
 trade under the Town Hall on Saturday 
 mornings until 12 noon and two way    
 vehicular traffic is obliged to use   
 the narrow road on the east side of   
 the Town Hall.  On the west side, the 
 road is pedestrianised and more market
 stalls are sited here.  In the north  
 end of the Town Hall is the Council   
 Chamber where Bridgnorth Town Council 
 meets and the remainder of the        
 building is taken up by the Courtroom 
 in which County Court cases are heard.
