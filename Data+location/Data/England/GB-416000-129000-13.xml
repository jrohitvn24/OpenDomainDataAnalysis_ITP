		<content> There are two Brownie packs in        
 Laverstock, meeting Fiday evenings in 
 the Village Hall.                     
 At pack meetings many games are       
 played. Before you become a Brownie   
 there is a four week waiting list     
 before enrollment. At Brownies there  
 is the usual 'bookwork' offering the  
 Footpath, Road and Highway badges     
 together with many other opportunities
 for learning new skills and helping   
 people.                               
 The Scouts this year went on a weekend
 camp. There were eight scouts and     
 three leaders, set to go to Great     
 Yews, Coombe Bissett. The camp was a  
 great success. Survival was the       
 keynote, boiling all water, making a  
 bivouac, night hike and a sing-song   
 round the camp fire, were activities  
 enjoyed by all. Monday 6th May saw the
 group home, very tired and grubbier!  </content>
