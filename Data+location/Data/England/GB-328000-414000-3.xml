		<title>03WILDLIFE - ROYAL BIRKDALE 1</title>
		<content> The course at the golf club is laid   
 out on sand dune pasture.It is rich in
 wildlife and provides homes for a host
 of specialiased animals and plants.   
 Most of the course is included in a   
 site of Special Scientific Interest   
 scheduled by the Nature Conservancy   
 Council.Damp hollows (dune slacks) are
 found in some of the lower lying areas
 between the dune banks.These are      
 usually dominated by a creeping willow
 but can also contain a wide variety of
 other plants including marsh,orchids, 
 grass of Parnassus and many sedge and 
 rush species.These wet slacks/ponds   
 support one of the rarest animals in  
 Britain,the natterjack toad.The yellow
 stripe along the centre of the back   
 makes the toad easy to see and gives  
 it its old English name "golden back" 
 The Sefton coastdune area is probably 
 the toad's main stronghold in Britain.</content>
