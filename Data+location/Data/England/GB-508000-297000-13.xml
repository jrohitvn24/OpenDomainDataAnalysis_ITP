		<title>13STIBBINGTON'S NATURE RESERVE</title>
		<content>  The nature reserve is situated to the
 north of Stibbington Field Study      
 Centre and lies between the river Nene
 and the A1. The reserve has developed 
 around pits which were used for the   
 extraction of gravel until forty years
 ago.                                  
  The present owner is keen to promote 
 wildlife conservation and to this end 
 has allowed the area to regenerate    
 naturally, though a small number of   
 trees has been planted. Consequently  
 the area now contains forty years     
 growth of vegetation and also includes
 lakes which are well stocked with     
 fish, various mammals and birds. The  
 number of water birds has recently    
 suffered a decline due to attacks by  
 mink.                                 
  The area is used for a variety of    
 study purposes by residents of the    
 Stibbington Field Study Centre.       </content>
