		<content>  A review of the Brookmans Park area  
 produced some disappointing results   
 for the week July 4th-11th. The       
 entertainments were all locally       
 advertised and were as follows: a     
 barbeque,acoffee morning,a school fete
 and akeep fit class. As well as these 
 as permanent attractions in the area  
 are the golf course the park and a    
 number of pleasant public houses. For 
 amore varied programme of events one  
 has to travel further afield to places
 such as Potters Bar and Hatfield and, 
 of course London is in reach. Our     
 researchers who were all 14 years  old
 and do not live in the Brookmans Park 
 area but in Cheshunt which is more    
 built up felt that there were not     
 enough entertainments there which     
 would appeal to their age group and   
 thought it unlikely they wouldbe able 
 to afford to travel for a better time.</content>
