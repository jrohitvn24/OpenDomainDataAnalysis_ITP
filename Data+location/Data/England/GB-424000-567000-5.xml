		<content> In the heart of the Dene is           
 fisherman's Lodge which is placed     
 conveniently next to the river (noted 
 for its cuisine).                     
 Near Pets' Corner is Coleman's Field, 
 a graveyard for pets which is         
 frequently visited by their former    
 owners.                               
 Paddy Freemans is an area with a mini 
 lake, play area, football pitches,    
 bowling green, tennis courts and rugby
 pitches.                              
 There is a History Trail and          
 Nature Trail. The Dene recently       
 celebrated its 100th birthday and     
 there is a Centenary House at Pets'   
 Corner giving leaflets etc.           
                                       
 The Dene is a welcome break to the    
 city centre and is used by joggers and
 dog walkers and is very popular.
