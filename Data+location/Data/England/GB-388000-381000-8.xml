		<title>08A day in my life.</title>
		<content> I usually wake up at 6.50a.m.and reach
 out to switch off my alarm on my      
 digital watch. Iget out of bed quickly
 so that I don't go back to sleep.Then 
  I open my curtains and switch the    
 light on.After I go for a wash and    
 return to my bedroom to put on  my    
 grey school clothes.While I am getting
 dressed I hear my parents alarm ring  
 in their bedroom. A few minutes later 
 they come into my room and say good   
 morning to me.                        
 My dad goes downstairs to start       
 making the breakfast while my mum has 
 a wash.At this time I am left just    
 hanging around so I go into my big    
 brothers bedroom and annoy him for    
 something to do.Sometimes he yells at 
 me and sends me out but at other times
 he lets me annoy him.By this time it  
 is about 7.20 and I go downstairs for 
 breakfast.                            </content>
