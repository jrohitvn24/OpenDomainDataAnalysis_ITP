		<title>01BERKSWICH BLOCK REVIEW</title>
		<content>  Our block consists of an area just to
the east of Berkswich School and       
positioned between two main road routes
from Stafford to Rugeley and Stafford  
to Cannock.It has one small village    
called Brocton in which mainly         
professional people live and who       
commute to large towns nearby and in   
the West Midlands.The rest of the block
is divided rougly equally between open 
heathland owned by Staffordshire County
Council and the Forestry Commission    
with some fringe farm land around the  
edge.                                  
  We have looked at the use of the land
by man and its natural state.We have   
looked at Brocton and its village life 
and the attitudes of the people.We have
included notes on various special      
features contained in the block and    
land owners and farming.
