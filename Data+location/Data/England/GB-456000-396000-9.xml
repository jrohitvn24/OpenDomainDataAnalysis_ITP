		<title>09THE MANOR HOUSE</title>
		<content>      The Manor House which is         
 situated in Wadworth is to be found on
 the road which leads to Rossington.   
 The Manor House was built in the 14th 
 century and was made out of limestone 
 and in that century the Fitzwilliams  
 owned it and then the Copley family   
 bought it. The roof has been covered  
 or thacked with stone slates. The     
 windows didn't have wooden frames     
 round they had stone pillars. In 1750 
 or somewhere round that time the      
 Arthur family sold the house to a     
 Josiah Wordsworth who also bought and 
 built Wadworth Hall. Then they moved  
 back to Wadworth Hall and the Manor   
 House just became a farm house. Now a 
 man called Donald Butler owns the     
 Manor House and it is no longer a     
 Farm House Donald Butler just lives   
 there.
