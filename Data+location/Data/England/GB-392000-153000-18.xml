 With more and more mechanisation on   
 farms,there are few job opportunities 
 in the  area. Only 5% of the          
 population finds employment in        
 Edington, working on the farms,in one 
 of three small industrial workshops or
 in the shops and public houses. Many  
 need personal transport to work       
 further afield, and two people        
 actually commute to London each day   
 -110 miles away! With the rising cost 
 of transport, the village is being    
 vacated by the working community,     
 leaving the unemployed or, even more  
 so,the retired.This is causing an     
 imbalance of population which         
 threatens the lives of the shops,     
 Post Office and village school. This  
 will eventually result in a small     
 cross-section of society being able to
 afford,or wishing,to live here.       </content>
