		<content>     The water pipe-line from Elan     
 Valley to Birmingham runs through this
 area.{The Studley Tunnel}is one of the
 trouble spots. The tunnel is marked by
 concrete pillars, which were used as  
 sighting points to keep it straight.  
 They are known as{Monuments.}The      
 tunnel was first opened in 1904. It is
 now badly in need of repair. Plans are
 being made to build a new tunnel.     
     This summer, 1985, they are going 
 to take samples of the ground. A new  
 tunnel will possibly be built in the  
 next 5 years. It will cost            
 approximately 2\ million pounds.      
     At the moment it is very difficult
 to repair the old tunnel because the  
 water can only be cut off for 2 days. 
     An agreement has been signed with{
{The Welsh Water Authority}that they   
 will supply water to Birmingham for   
 the next 99 years.                    </content>
