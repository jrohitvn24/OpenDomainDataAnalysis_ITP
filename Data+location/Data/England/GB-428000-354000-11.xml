		<title>11The Cromford Canal</title>
		<content> On Friday 7th June,1985 we visited the
 Cromford Canal.The Canal is 14 miles  
 long,but only about 2 miles are now   
 navigable.Our class went for a ride in
 a restored horse_drawn narrow boat    
 called John Gray.The narrow boat was  
 about 11 metres long and weighed      
 about half a ton.The boat could carry 
 50 people at a speed of about 2 miles 
 per hour.                             
 At the Wharf there were 2 horses,one  
 of which,Tina,was used to pull the    
 narrow boat.The horse had a special   
 harness to help it pull the narrow    
 boat.The horses were bred especially  
 for pulling heavy loads(up to 5 tons!)
 We travelled for 2 miles along the    
 canal as far as the Leawood pump      
 house.The Canal was full of           
 interesting wildlife including        
 moorhens,coots,water voles,and a      
 nesting grebe.                        </content>
