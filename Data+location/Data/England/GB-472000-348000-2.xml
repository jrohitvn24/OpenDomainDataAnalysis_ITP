		<title>02ELSTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content>{Elston}is a village with a population 
 of about 660, 50 more than in the last
 census of 1983. Unlike{East Stoke,}it 
 has several small estates of large    
 modern houses which have been built in
 the last twenty years.  This fairly   
 extensive development has altered the 
 character of the village, since many  
 of the newcomers commute to the nearby
 towns of{Newark}and{Nottingham}for    
 leisure as well as employment, and are
 therefore less involved in village    
 life than the village-based population
 of the past. Few of the villagers work
 on the land, although there are still 
 5 workable farms associated with the  
 village. {Elston's}amenities include  
 two churches, a pub (Chequers Inn), a 
 shop/P.O. and a primary school - not  
 all of which are within this block,   
 since parts of the village lie in the 
 corners of the 3 adjacent blocks.     </content>
