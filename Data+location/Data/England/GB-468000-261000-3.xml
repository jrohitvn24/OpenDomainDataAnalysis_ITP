		<title>03 Yew Tree Farm</title>
		<content> This rented arable farm of 400 acres  
is named after a still living,1000 year
old Yew Tree. The farmhouse dates from 
the 1850's &amp; there is a traditional    
barn. The clay soil supports 200 acres 
of wheat &amp; less amounts of rape, barley
&amp; oats. 25 acres are kept as permanent 
grassland. Rabbits &amp; pigeons are a big 
nuisance causing much damage.          
The livestock consists mainly of sheep-
350 ewes &amp; 620 lambs. After birth the  
lambs are kept in the barn for 48 hours
before going outside. This is usually  
between mid-March &amp; the first week in  
April. There are 3 pet pigs with 9     
piglets.                               
There are two tractors worth 18,000    
pounds &amp; a new combine worth 50,000    
pounds. The wheels are interchangeable,
e.g. narrow wheels allow crop spraying 
without damage.
