		<content>{CUBS AND SCOUTS}- The cub and scout   
 hall is next to Sanders Park. A cub   
 pack is organised in sixes, with a    
 leader called a sixer. Each six has a 
 different coloured tie bobble. In cubs
 you play all kinds of games. You also 
 make things, like candles, and try to 
 get badges, for example, a music badge
 by playing an instrument. Cubs also   
 parade in Sanders Park and in the     
 carnival.                             
{GUIDES AND BROWNIES}- On a Friday I go
 to Guides. It starts at 6.30pm and    
 finishes at 8.30pm. You can start at  
 ten years old and finish at thirteen. 
 You learn all about Lord and Lady     
 Baden Powell. If you are seven you can
 go to Brownies. We go to the guide hut
 on the Kidderminster road. Guides wear
 a blue skirt and a burgundy tie. Brown
 -ies wear a brown dress and a yellow  
 tie.                                  </content>
