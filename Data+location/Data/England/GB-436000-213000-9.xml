		<content>My mum gets up between 7.00 and 7.30.  
She gets us up at about 7.55,then when 
we have gone to school she does the    
house work. Then she goes to see her   
mum and dad.She does the shopping for  
her mum and herself,then takes it      
back  to her mum's house.She then goes 
home to cook her dinner,then washes up 
and tidies up the mess that Ben has    
made  with his toys.She then sits      
down to watch Sons and Daughters.At    
about 5.00 my mum has the tea ready    
for us.At 6.00  she goes to work and   
comes home at 10.00.(She works at a    
factory making calenders).When she gets
home she gets ready for bed and has a  
cup of tea. She then watches T.V. for  
a while and goes to bed at about 11.30.
