		<content> Return of the Jedi is one of a series 
 of{fantasy films}featuring men and    
 robots who use laser weapons in their 
 battles. The hero is Luke Skywalker.  
 One of the horrible, fierce, heavy-   
 breathing robots is Luke's father.    
 He wears a dark mask, and is called   
 Darth Vader.  He has been turned to   
 the "Dark Side" by the Dark Monster,  
 the Emperor.                          
 In the first film, Star Wars, the     
 Emperor designed a mechanical moon    
 called the Death Star. The film ends  
 with the hero and his friends escaping
 after destroying this artificial      
 planet. George Lucas wrote and        
 produced the films and I enjoyed them 
 very much. I have books, toys and     
 games connected with them.            
 Sometimes the actors are replaced by  
 stuntmen or dummies when it is too    
 dangerous for the film stars.         </content>
