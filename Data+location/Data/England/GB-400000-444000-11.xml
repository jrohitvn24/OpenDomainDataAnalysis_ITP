		<title>11A CANAL WALK FROM SILSDEN</title>
		<content> Four boys from class 6 walked along   
 the towpath from Silsden on July 4th, 
 1985.                                 
{Damon}saw these boats: four hire      
 craft, five cabin-cruisers, three     
 maintenance barges, a speedboat, a    
 rowing boat and several canoes. One   
 boat was 'en route' from Sheffield to 
 London.                               
{David}saw seven fishermen, six        
 walkers, a jogger and a cyclist, who  
 had joined the canal at Shipley. Two  
 ramblers from Manchester had walked   
 along every part of the canal.        
{Jonathan}looked at wild life. He noted
 mallards with chicks, swans, lapwings 
 and eight types of wild flowers.      
{Shawn}looked for pollution. He thought
 the canal looked clean and colourful. 
 He did find some waste paper, tin cans
 and polythene bags but little oil.    
 All the boys enjoyed their walk.      </content>
