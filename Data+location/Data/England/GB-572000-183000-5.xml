		<content> There are two ditches on the {NORTH   
 and{EAST}sides of{CLEANAWAY.}ON the   
 other two sides there are{SEAWALLS.   
 One ditch is collecting the leachate  
 and the water. One is to see the      
 difference in the water.{LEACHATE}is  
 a{LIQUID}and out of that there is a   
{GAS}called{AMMONIA.}The ammonia is    
 getting into the river and killing the
 fish. The are trying to stop it       
 getting into the river with a pump    
 from the ditch into the lake. A pump  
 then sprays it into the air and onto  
 the ground and it evaporates. The     
 ammonia gas is dangerous to the fish. 
 The people are  not satisfied with    
 this way of disposing of the liquid   
 leachate because the sprayer keeps    
 breaking down. They are working on a  
 new{MACHINE}to encourage{MICROBES}to  
 eat the ammonia. So that the water can
 run straight out into fields &amp; creeks.</content>
