		<content> Houses cluster around the village of  
 The Lea, especially under and on the  
 side of Bailey Point and at           
 Hoovers Lane.There is very            
 little ribbon development just new    
 houses along the Pontshill road.There 
 is infilling of new houses in the     
 village itself.Two Councils projects  
 -one in 1950 of Swedish type at       
 Stockholm Place are now houses        
 privately owned.The second project was
 at Knightshill and adjacent the Old   
 Peoples bungalows at Saunders Close.  
 Both Estates have Street Lighting     
 although there is no other except on  
 the modern Housing at Mitcheldean.The 
 old cottages have 18 inch single walls
 of stone.There is a beautifull        
 privately owned residential caravan   
 site which is very mainly occupied by 
 Senior citizens from large towns who  
 have retired to this peaceful site.   </content>
