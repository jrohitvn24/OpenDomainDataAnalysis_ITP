		<title>17A TYPICAL SATURDAY</title>
		<content>   Every Saturday I get up around 8    
 a.m. and watch television for about an
 hour and a half.  I have breakfast at 
 9.30 a.m. then I watch television     
 until dinnertime.  I have my dinner   
 around 12.30.  I usually have         
 sandwiches, a packet of crisps and a  
 drink.  After dinner if its fine I go 
 out to play.   Sometimes I ride my    
 bicycle round the local lanes or help 
 my parents by mowing the grass.  We   
 have a big mower on which you can sit.
 If its wet I play electronic games or 
 computer games.  We usually have a    
 cooked meal about 6.30 p.m.  Sometimes
 we have chips with two eggs.  Chips   
 are potatoes which have been cut into 
 strips and fried in deep fat.  After  
 tea I watch television until I go to  
 bed about 9.30 p.m.
