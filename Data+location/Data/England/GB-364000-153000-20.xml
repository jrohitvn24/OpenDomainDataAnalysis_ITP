		<content>   We interviewd 78 year old Mrs Evans 
 who was born in 1907 and has lived in 
 this area all her life. We asked her  
 how things have changed in Midsomer   
 Norton since 1925.                    
 Talking about food and cooking she    
 said :"As there were no refridgerators
 in 1925 people kept food outside in a 
 safe and they had a meat slab in the  
 pantry to keep the meat cold.Most     
 people kept pigs in the garden and    
 kept the bacon hanging from the       
 ceiling.  Most people grew their      
 own vegetables and fruit was widely   
 available from orchards, which have   
 largely disappeared now.  Cooking was 
 much slower and most people had a     
 coal-fired range in the kitchen."     
 "It was much stricter for children in 
 those days-you only spoke when you    
 were spoken to and if you had visitors
 you had to behave and sit still."     </content>
