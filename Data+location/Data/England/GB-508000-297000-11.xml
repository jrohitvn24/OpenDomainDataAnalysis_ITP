		<title>11ATTITUDES TO STUDY CENTRE</title>
		<content>  Stibbington Field Studies Centre was 
 set up more than twenty years ago by  
 the Headmaster of the former village  
 school using surplus accommodation on 
 the school site.  In 1982 when the    
 village school closed the field centre
 took over all of the buildings whilst 
 village children travelled to nearby  
 Elton to school.  This led to some    
 considerable discontent amongst       
 villagers who resented the fact that  
 their children were no longer able to 
 attend school in their own village.   
  Today attitudes to the field centre  
 are varied: some local people are     
 still hostile towards it and some     
 complain that the visiting children   
 have trespassed onto their land, but  
 on the whole a good relationship      
 exists, with many local people        
 supporting the need for town children 
 to come to the countryside.           </content>
