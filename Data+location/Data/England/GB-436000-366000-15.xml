		<title>15RECREATION IN WINGERWORTH</title>
		<content>   We decided to find out what the     
 residents of{Wingerworth}thought about
 their village.  We made a list of all 
 the leisure activities that           
 Wingerworth has to offer.  They are:  
                                       
{Tennis courts      Church activities

 frequently used.  The{Lido}(page 4)   
 was most popular, followed closely by
