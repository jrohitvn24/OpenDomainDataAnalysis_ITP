		<content>    The church stands in a commanding  
 position overlooking most of the      
 surrounding area. The exterior is     
 mainly of pudding stone, with flint   
 and quartz pebbles. The nave is the   
 oldest part of the building, dating   
 from the 11th century, and the walls, 
 which are three feet (one metre)      
 thick, contain five Norman windows.   
 The brick tower dates from the early  
 16th century, when it was constructed 
 by the Knights Hospitallers to replace
 an earlier wooden one.                
    In 1869, the church was restored   
 for about Â£1400 and the appearance of 
 the interior mainly reflects that     
 time.                                 
    The most interesting parts of the  
 church have separate pages devoted to 
 them.
