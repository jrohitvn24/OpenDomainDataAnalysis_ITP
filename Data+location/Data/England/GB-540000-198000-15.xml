		<title>15JEWISH CEMETERY</title>
		<content> Since opening in 1960 there have been 
10,000 burials.There are about 500     
bodies buried per year.Of all the      
10,000 the oldest is 100 years old,the 
youngest is a still born child.Jewish  
dead are buried on the same day as     
death,if possible before sunset.The    
Rabbi said"he had been working at the  
cemetery since it opened".He employs   
8 men and 1 woman of all faiths and has
enough land left for 20 years of       
burials.On June 7 1985 a monument to   
the 6 million jews killed in Nazi      
Germany was consecrated by the Chief   
Rabbi of Great Britain,Sir Immanuel    
Jacobovitz.The monument is made of     
granite and has 2 Hebrew inscriptions. 
One on top saying"remember"and one on  
the stone saying"for those I weep".
