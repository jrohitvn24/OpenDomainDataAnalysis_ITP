		<title>20Law and Order</title>
		<content>   Law and order mainly concerns the   
 police,but it also concerns the       
 public.The police forces part is to   
 detect and prevent crime.They go to   
 football matches to control crowds,   
 they have horses to help with crowd   
 control at street demonstrations.     
   There are about 70,000 policemen in 
 England.They patrol on the beat,in    
 cars,on motorbikes,horses and in      
 helicopters.                          
   The public part is to inform the    
 police,keep a lookout and try to stop 
 crimes.                               
   Our area is worked out,firstly on   
 the number of people living here and  
 secondly on the mileage to be covered.
 Our local policeman patrols in a car. 
 In a village he parks the car and     
 walks around.He protects life and     
 property deals with petty vandalism,  
 accidents and burglaries.             </content>
