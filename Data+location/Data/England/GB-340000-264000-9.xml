		<title>09THE RIVER LUGG AT AYMESTREY</title>
		<content>  The stretch of the Lugg between the  
 bridges at Aymestrey and Lyepole is   
 one of the most beautiful in Britain. 
 The steeply wooded sides with their   
 deciduous and coniferous trees provide
 a natural habitat for wildlife,many   
 varieties of bird including the       
 occasional{kingfisher}; squirrels,    
{badgers, otters and wild mink.        
   The river flows over a limestone    
 bed,very clean and ideal for the{trout
 and{grayling}which dominate the river.
 The maximum weight for both types     
 seems to be 1lb. but most are above a 
 half lb. The occasional{salmon}has    
 also been reported. The fishing is    
 private and restricted to fly.        
   The{weir}which is about half a mile 
 above the bridge at Aymestrey is a    
 popular picnic spot with a small rocky
 beach and water deep enough to bathe.
