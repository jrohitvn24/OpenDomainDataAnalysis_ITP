		<content> Today was the last day of the school  
 year. It was no ordinary final day.   
 It was the day Warley Junior School   
 was closing. Not only were the 4th.   
 years leaving to go to a new school,  
 in a way we were all leaving. Our     
 school is being amalgamated with the  
 Warley Infant School because of       
 falling numbers. The new Warley       
 Primary School will be in the existing
 junior school, and the infant building
 in Essex Way will be closed. During   
 the holiday the infant books and      
 equipment are to be moved into the    
 junior building. Some alterations are 
 going to be made to create more space 
 and a new central resource area where 
 all the library books will be kept.   
   So today it is "Goodbye, Warley     
 Junior School." and "Hello and best   
 wishes to Warley Primary School."
