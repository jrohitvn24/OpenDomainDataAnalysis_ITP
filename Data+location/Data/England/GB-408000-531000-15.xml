		<title>15A COMMUTER'S FAMILY</title>
		<content>  The Brown family have lived in the   
 village for 15 years.Mr Brown works on
 Tyneside and travels there daily.The  
 children,Gareth and Natalie were born 
 in the village.The family could live  
 anywhere in the area but chose        
 Hamsterley. Mr Brown says,"As my      
 occupation in business is in Tyneside,
 together with long hours spent in     
 towns and cities,the peace and quiet  
 of country living is very appealing.  
 Recognising the lack of cultural      
 amenities,our children are encouraged 
 to take part in other activities such 
 as music,theatre,tennis and archery   
 which warrants transporting by me.Our 
 canal and waterway interests are      
 shared and pursued as a family group. 
  The facilities available in towns are
 within easy travelling distance and we
 feel that is better to live in this   
 environment and travel to them."      </content>
