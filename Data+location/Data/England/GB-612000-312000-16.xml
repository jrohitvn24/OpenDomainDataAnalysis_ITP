		<title>16BMX &amp; Scouts in Ringland</title>
		<content>      {Bicycle Moto Cross}began in 1969
 and there is a track in Ringland owned
 by the 'Norwich Flyers' at the gravel 
 pits. We have a weatherproof surface  
 and lots of different jumps and bends 
 called berms designed to throw you off
 your bike. We have heats called motos 
 and then final races.Our track is fast
 and long meant for power riders and we
 hold open, club, regional and national
 meetings there.{(Simon Browning).     
     {Scouts}meet every Wednesday      
 evening and each week a different     
 patrol is on duty so their patrol     
 leader breaks the flag. At our        
 meetings we play games and work for   
 badges and awards. At the end of each 
 meeting, a prayer is read and we are  
 dismissed. We also go on a summer camp
 and two weekend camps in April in     
 Scotch Hill Woods (Roundwood).
