		<title>06CHURCH IN LOWICK</title>
		<content>The church stands on a hill at the     
Northeast end of the village.          
It dates from the middle ages and has  
glass from that period. The minister is
shared with other villages and services
are not held every Sunday. Vandalism   
has been a recent problem and the      
church is now kept locked. Among the   
many memorials inside is a brass of a  
Knight and his Lady which may be rubbed
for a small fee.
