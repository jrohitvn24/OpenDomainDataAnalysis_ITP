		<title>13THE CHURCH &amp; THE COMMUNITY</title>
		<content>   Clifton  Hampden  is  part of a Team
 Ministry in  which a  single full time
 vicar  is  shared  by the  parishes of
 Clifton Hampden,  Culham,  Little     
 Wittenham  and  Long  Wittenham.  Each
 parish has its  own  officers who do a
 great deal  of the  day to day running
 of the parish. Although  only a  small
 proportion  of  the  population  are  
 regular attenders the Church continues
 to be a focal  point for  many village
 activities.  For  example  the  summer
 Village Festival Weekend was organised
 in aid of the Church Restoration Fund.
                                       
   Each month the four parishes jointly
 publish  a  magazine  which  contains 
 reports  of  all  local  activities as
 well as matters more directly relating
 to the churches.
