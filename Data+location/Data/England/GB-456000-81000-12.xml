		<title>12SHANKLIN OLD VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The original Shanklin Village started 
 at what is now Shanklin cinema or     
 theatre.It was a rather large farm    
 then.In 1830 the only buildings in the
 village were an old church,the Manor  
 House,the Vestry,the Crab Inn and     
 Peaches Farm.The first and oldest     
 building to be built around that area 
 was Fishermans Cottage which was built
 by a Mr Colenutt in 1817.He was the   
 man who opened Shanklin Chine which is
 a path that leads down to the         
 sea.Shanklin Chine is right by the Old
 Village.Hotels were built by          
 Victorian tourists e.g Daish's and    
 Holliers.Cottages were built for the  
 poorer people.A railway was built and 
 it went straight through Shanklin.This
 made Shanklin more popular and it     
 spread into a holiday resort.Shanklin 
 never spreads southwards but always   
 spreads towards the north.            </content>
