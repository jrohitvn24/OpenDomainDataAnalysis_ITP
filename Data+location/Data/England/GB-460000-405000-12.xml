		<content> There are several types of school. The
 schools range from Infants to         
 Comprehensives. In the Infants in{    
{Armthorpe}you have to be 5 years old  
 to go there. When you come out you are
 7 years old. Juniors you start at 7   
 years old and leave at 11 to go to the
 Comprehensives which you leave when   
 you are aged 16 or 18.                
 In the First Schools at{Edenthorpe}and
{Kirk Sandall}you are 5 when you start 
 and 8 when you leave. Then you go to  
 Middle Schools till you are 12, when  
 you go to a Comprehensive. Only at    
 the Comprehensives do you have to wear
 uniform. At the other schools you have
 a choice.                             
{Shaw Wood}is the only school in our   
 Block to have its own swimming pool.  
 Most of the schools have their own    
 playing fields. Some have facilities  
 for netball, basketball &amp; other games.</content>
