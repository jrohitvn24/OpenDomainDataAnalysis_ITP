		<content> The area is underlain by Carboniferous
 Limestone in the south,Edale Shales in
 the centre and Gritstone to the north 
 the geology had dramatically          
 influenced the landscape, which       
 comprisises a wide steep-sided valley 
 with a dramatic  limestone            
 gorge (Winnats) to the west.          
 Plants and animals relate to the      
 underlying geology and past and       
 present landscapes.To the south is    
 limestone grassland with pocketsof    
 remant ash woodland; in the north is  
 more intensively farmed,resulting in  
 mostly open habitats including        
 hayfields, marshy areas and streams.  
 The area is criss crossed with well   
 posted public footpaths and rights of 
 way which are much used by            
 visitors.The National Park rangers    
 patrol the area and maintain the      
 footpaths and signs.                  </content>
