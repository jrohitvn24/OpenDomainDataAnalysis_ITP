		<title>13Mr Sydney T**** of Thackley</title>
		<content> Mr T****, like most of our informants,
 is now retired. He used to own a local
 milk-round,but has now sold it.The    
 milk round meant that he knows many   
 people in Thackley,from all walks of  
 life.He has lived there for the last  
 30 years,and likes the village a lot. 
 He feels that Thackley is becoming    
 purely a{residential}and{service      
 industry area,although the local      
 textile mill is doing well.Most jobs  
 there seem to go to the 30+ age group.
 Reflecting his own preoccupations, Mr 
 T**** talked to us mainly about       
 leisure. He feels that part of        
 Thackley's attractiveness lies in its 
{gardens.}Most people,he says,take a   
 real pride in their gardens, and they 
 also go in for really big allotments. 
 The cricket club is{"mediocre"}a big  
 admission for a Yorkshireman,although 
 he admits the players are keen enough.</content>
