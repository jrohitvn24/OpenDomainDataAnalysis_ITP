		<title>12Davenham Parish Council</title>
		<content> The Parish Council are a group of men 
 and women between the ages of 21 and  
 80 concerned with local government.   
 There are 11 people who are elected to
 be on the Parish Council. Their job is
 to look after the community. The plans
 they have at the moment are the       
 by-pass to be built in 1989, another  
 tree planting scheme, more plants in  
 the war memorial, to make sure the    
 village is kept clean and tidy and    
 provide a new toddlers playground.    
 They get the money for these things by
 putting 1.4p on rates. We asked them  
 what things they would like to see for
 the village. They said less traffic   
 and more community spirit. They       
 weren't trained to be a Parish        
 Councillor and out of the 11 people on
 the PC three of them are women.
