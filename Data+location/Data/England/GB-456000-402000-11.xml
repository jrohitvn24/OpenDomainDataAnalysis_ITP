     THE SHEFFIELD AND SOUTH YORKSHIRE 
 NAVIGATION USES THE RIVER DON AS ITS  
 MAIN ARTERY,SUPPLEMENTED BY A SYSTEM  
 OF CANALS.THE DON NAVIGATION ACT OF   
 THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY INCREASED PLANS
 FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF WATER TRANSPORT
 IN SOUTH YORKSHIRE.DONCASTER IS AN    
 INLAND TOWN AND THE SOUTH YORKSHIRE   
 NAVIGATION LINKED SHEFFIELD TO THE    
 RIVER TRENT AT KEADBY IN 1821,AND THUS
 DIRECTLY TO THE HUMBER ESTUARY AND THE
 NORTH SEA.COAL AND MINERAL ORES ARE   
 THE CHIEF CARGOES.NOWADAYS THE COAL IS
 TAKEN FROM THE COLLIERIES IN LARGE    
 PANS,LOCALLY KNOWN AS 'TOM PUDDINGS', 
 PULLED BY DIESEL ENGINED BARGES.      
     CANALS ARE NOW CONTROLLED BY THE  
 BRITISH TRANSPORT COMMISSION,AND      
 MODERNISATION PLANS INCLUDE THE       
 FACILITY FOR LARGER CONTAINER BARGES  
 WHICH WILL HANDLE INCREASED TONNAGE.  </content>
