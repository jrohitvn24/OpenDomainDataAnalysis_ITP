		<content>  In Charlton Kings, six doctors work  
 in a group practice. They have a new  
 purpose built health centre in the    
 London Road. There is a separate      
 dental practice at the centre. Also   
 attached to the health centre is a    
 health visitor who helps with young   
 children and the house-bound.         
 Residents use the Cheltenham General  
 Hospital which is only about a mile   
 away. Old people are catered for in   
 three old people's homes: Nazareth    
 House, Greville House and East Court. 
 Nazareth House is run by a Roman      
 Catholic Order and residents pay Â£95  
 per week, with a reduced rate for     
 those who cannot afford it. Greville  
 House and East Court are run by the   
 Social Services Department of         
 Gloucestershire County Council.
