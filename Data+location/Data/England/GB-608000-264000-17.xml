		<title>17COMMUNITY COUNCIL ACTIVITIES</title>
		<content>                                       
The Community Council organises it to  
raise money for the village and        
hundreds of people come along.  To     
start it off we have a big procession. 
First of all we have the Community     
Council May Queen and her two          
attendants who are chosen during       
April, then comes the May Queen for    
the church and her attendants.   The   
clown follows and then come the        
Majorettes.                            
There are a lot of stalls set up along 
the sides of the road.  There are cake 
stalls, bookstalls, clothes stalls,    
Lucky Dips and many more.  Half of the 
proceeds go to the Community Council   
and the other half goes to the stall   
holders.  There are also stalls  with  
competitions and there is usually an   
exhibition in the village hall. There  
are entertainers and a Grand  Draw.    </content>
