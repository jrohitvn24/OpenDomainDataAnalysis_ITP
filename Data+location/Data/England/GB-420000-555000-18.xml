 built by the Bowes Railway Company for
 their railway workers.The railway is  
 now dismantled and the cottages are   
 quite remote,sometimes being blocked  
 in during Winter.They are now owned by
 people who enjoy peace and natural    
 surroundings.They travel to nearby    
 towns to work,shop and go to school.  
 Some work at home.A baker calls twice 
 a week and a fishmonger comes once.

 Hill,Hedley Fell and Causey area are  
 built of stone and over a hundred     
 years old.There has been very little  
 new building.Apart from the buildings 
 near main roads there is no mains gas 
 or sewerage.Old Ravensworth Farm does 
 not even have a septic tank.          </content>
