		<title>17ATTITUDES OF WALTON PEOPLE</title>
		<content> We asked  56 people their attitudes   
 towards Walton. Their answers depended
 on whether they lived there or not.   
 People who live in Walton, do so      
 because they either work there or like
 the town.They like the town because   
 it is a friendly,peaceful place       
 and they like the sea. To improve     
 Walton many people wanted a sports    
 centre built along with more          
 facilities for the young.             
   People we asked who did not live in 
 Walton had come mainly either to work 
 or to shop. Most people had come from 
 nearby Frinton. Many people would     
 improve Walton by building more shops.
