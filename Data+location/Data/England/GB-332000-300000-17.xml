		<content>EMPLOYMENT IN THE AREA                 
Agriculture provides the greater part  
 f employment in the area.A number of  
smallholders, however, augment their   
income with a second job.Quite a number
of people work out of the immediate    
area,commuting to Shrewsbury or to a   
creamery and food factory in           
Minsterley,about 3 miles away.This     
number of commuters is increasing as   
agriculture becomes less labour        
intensive.There is a factory in        
Bentlawnt Imperial Electric,           
manufacturing high quality domestic    
fires, which sell nationwide, and      
distributing lighting and other        
electrical products.                   
Hope valley service station employs 3  
people in its motor repair             
workshop,filling station and small     
shop.There is also a number of self    
employed people.                       </content>
