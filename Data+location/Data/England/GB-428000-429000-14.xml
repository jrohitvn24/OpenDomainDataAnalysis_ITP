		<title>14CHILDRENS RHYMES,S.LEEDS</title>
		<content> The children at Bewerley Street       
 Primary School told their teacher     
 about {DIPPING GAMES}:rhymes used to  
 decide who is going to be the chaser  
 in their playground games. The person 
 saying the rhyme points to each child 
 in turn and the person pointed to on  
 the last word is "on".                
 1.One potato,two potato,three potato, 
 four,five potato,six potato,seven     
 potato ,more.                         
 2.Eeny meeny maker acker air ra

 and you do not have it.(rhyme repeated
 until only one child left.They are on)

 4.Dip dip dip,my blue ship. Sailing on
 the water like a cup and saucer, you  
 are it.

 are remembered by our parents.        </content>
