		<title>01NASSINGTON.GENERAL REVIEW.</title>
		<content>The area is gently undulating and based
on limestones of the Jurassic Oolite   
series.The River Nene flows toward the 
sea and is navigable to boats up to the
size of a large canal barge.The rocks  
have been used to build many of the    
older homes but recent expansion has   
seen the use of brick and other man-   
made materials.The population is about 
670.Few now work in the block-most     
commute to local towns.As these towns  
expand the area is increasingly popular
and properties continue to rise in     
price.This has important social implic-
ations.Agriculture is highly intensive 
and employs few.Large machines partly  
explain the widespread removal of      
hedgerows and consequent reduction in  
wildlife habitats and scenic interest. 
Efforts are being made to redress the  
balance.Services are good with shops,  
pubs and a lower school.               </content>
