		<title>12Spare Time in Lostock</title>
		<content>   I enjoy my spare time after school. 
 I do all kinds of things. Sometimes my
{friend rings}me up and asks me to come
 and play, so I do.                    
                                       
   I also enjoy watching T.V. My       
 favourite programme is{"Cover Up".    
   At the weekend or in school holidays
 we go on{day trips}out somewhere, but 
 this is usually during the holidays.  
 We{go away on holiday}sometimes for a 
 week or two.                          
   I sometimes{bake cakes}with my Mum. 
 I mix the mixture and put it on the   
 baking tray and my Mum puts the tray  
 in the oven.                          
                                       
   I used to go{swimming}at my friend's
 house. She used to live at the bottom 
 of our road but she has moved. Her    
 pool was indoors and it was heated and
 the pool had a slide.                 </content>
