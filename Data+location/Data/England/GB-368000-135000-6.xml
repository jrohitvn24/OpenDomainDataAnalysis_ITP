 There are many trains that pass       
 through our area every day,some stop  
 at Bruton while others like the       
 inter-city trains travel at high speed
 to London.Passenger and freight trains
 are often seen.                       
{Road                                  
 The A359 leads to Frome.It's a fairly 
 busy main road.Quaperlake St.is part  
 of the main road which is narrow and  
 bendy in places and therefore awkward 
 for heavy traffic to drive along.At   
 the top of Quaperlake St.the road     
 takes a sharp,left bend near'The Old  
 Toll House'.This name suggests that at
 one time travellers had to pay to use 
 the road.Other roads in our area are  
 the B3081 to Evercreech and various   
 country lanes that are narrow and     
 hilly in places.These lanes are used a
 lot by farmers to get to their fields.</content>
