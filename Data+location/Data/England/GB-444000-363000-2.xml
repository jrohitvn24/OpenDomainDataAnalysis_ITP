 hand in hand for the residents of such
 an area. The majority bask in the     
{beauty}of the surrounding countryside,
 appreciating greatly the{tranquility  
 and the{freshness.}However, heavy snow
 in winter could mean acute{transport  
{difficulties}which is intensified by  
 the almost total{lack of amenities.   
  However, the privilege of having such
 a wide variety of{wildlife}almost upon
 their doorsteps, the beautiful        
{landscape,}the{privacy}and (usually)  
 easy access to the{motorway}means for 
 many that the problems of winter,the  
 lack of facilities, the droves of     
{visitors}that flock to the area each  
 year and the incessant drone of the   
 motorway{traffic}pale into            
 insignificance.
