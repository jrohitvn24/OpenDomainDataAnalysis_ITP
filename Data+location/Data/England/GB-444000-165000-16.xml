		<title>16LIFE IN A PUBLIC HOUSE</title>
		<content> Life in a Public House is fun and     
 sometimes tiring. Opening and closing 
 times are as follows:-                
                                       
 Sundays     Noon-2pm &amp; 7pm - 10.30pm  
 Mondays to Thursdays                  
          10am-2.30pm &amp; 6pm - 10.30pm  
 Fridays and Saturdays                 
          10am-2.30pm &amp; 6pm - 11pm     
                                       
 We also have a helper who looks after 
 the Pub every Tuesday and a cleaner   
 who come every morning to clean the   
 Pub. We have a fruit machine which    
 needs maintenance every day. In the   
 Pub I have several jobs to do, like   
 re-stocking crisps and drinks (way    
 over 50 different types). During the  
 summer months opening may be extended 
 to 11pm on weekdays at the licencee's 
 discretion.                           
                                       </content>
