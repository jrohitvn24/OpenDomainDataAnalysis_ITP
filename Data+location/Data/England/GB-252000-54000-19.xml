		<title>19Interviewing the Lord Mayor</title>
		<content>   On the 15th July three children from
 Plympton St Maurice Primary School    
 went to the Lord Mayors Parlour to    
 interview him. We interviewed him     
 since he lives in Plympton and is the 
 first Plympton Lord Mayor.            
   He told us he was first elected a   
 counciler 18 years ago, and after 15  
 years he was eligable to become Lord  
 Mayor. The post of Lord Mayor         
 alternates between the two main       
 political parties. He said he had     
 lived in Plympton for 25 years and    
 owned two garages. The Lord Mayor     
 mentioned that there had been a lot of
 factories built since employment was  
 needed. He said Plympton had changed  
 since the byepass was built, and hoped
 to see Plympton St Maurice traffic    
 free and the Castle renovated. He     
 wanted to see trees planted.{Lisa
