		<content> The overall area covered by this      
 survey is very rural and consists of  
 four villages and part of a fifth.    
 Within these villages there are three 
 churches which form a central pivot   
 around which many of the villagers    
 lives revolves.Although unemployment  
 is high,in these villages there is    
 little unemployment.The main use of   
 the land in this survey is arable     
 farming although part of the area is  
 for gypsum production.The only        
 industrial enterprise is a factory    
 making plasterboard + other gypsum    
 products.The area is mainly flat and  
 only at Flawborough is there a hill   
 giving a view of the land.The area    
 consists of small woods,a river       
 various small streams and a disused   
 gypsum site which has a lake which    
 attracts wildlife and a variety of    
 flora.                                </content>
