		<title>03IMPROVING THE DEARNE AREA.</title>
		<content> A big improvement in our area is to   
 have more public toilets.  When you   
 need to go to the toilet, and you are 
 in Goldthorpe shopping there are never
 any near so I think we ought to have  
 more public toilets.  Another big     
 improvement would be a{sports centre }
 with a swimming pool and an indoor    
 bowling green and a gymnastics club   
 and other sports.  The reason that we 
 need a sports centre is because the   
 nearest sport centres are Rotherham   
 and Sheffield.  I think that would    
 make a big improvement in our area.  I
 think we ought to have a{snooker club}
 for children because in pubs they will
 not let children on the snooker       
 tables.
