		<title>09RUDDINGTON FOOTPATHS</title>
		<content>{Mrs. Gutteridge}has been working for  
 the {Footpath Preservation Society}   
 for 17 years. She makes sure that the 
 footpaths are kept in good repair.If  
 anyone reports an obstuction like a   
 fallen tree or an overgrown path she  
 writes or rings the Rushcliffe        
 Borough Council and they send workmen 
 to put it right.  People also watch   
 out for footpath signs that need      
 replacing.                            
 There is a booklet called {"Walks     
{Around Ruddington" }costing 50p. which
 shows the routes of the footpaths and 
 describes the flora and fauna that one
 may see.                              
 There are also six booklets produced  
 by the {History Society} called {     
{"Ruddington Trails"} which describe   
 the buildings which one can see in the
 village.                              
                                       </content>
