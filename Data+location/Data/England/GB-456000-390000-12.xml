 acres.He owns 240 acres and rents the 
 remainder ,most of which is owned by  
 Lord Scarbrough.His fields are divided
 mainly by barbed wire but he has the  
 occasional fence, hedge and  wall.He  
 grows mostly {barley}and{wheat}, but  
 his most profitable crop is{peas},    
 providing the weather is good.{Winter 
{wheat}and {winter barley}are sown in  
 the autumn and {spring  wheat}and{    
{spring barley }are sown in the        
 spring.The farmer sprays his crops to 
 prevent them from getting diseases.He 
 also sprays to kill weeds.When he     
 sells any corn it goes to corn        
 merchants and his peas go to London   
 markets.His{straw}is mostly used for  
 bedding his animals, and for feeding  
 them.If he doesn't need all his straw 
 he burns it in the field , taking care
 not to set alight anything else.      </content>
