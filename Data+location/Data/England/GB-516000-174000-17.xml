		<title>17SYON HOUSE</title>
		<content> The history of the house dates back   
 to the 15th century and for many years
 it has been the family home of the    
 Duchy of Northumberland.The house and 
 gardens are open to visitors and      
 receive a wide cross-section of       
 adults and children. It is busier in  
 the summer months with many foreign   
 visitors. Admission fees pay for the  
 considerable costs of upkeep of the   
 40 room house and the gardens and for 
 a skeleton staff. When the Duke's     
 family are in residence they have     
 their own separate staff.The house    
 has not been restored for some time.  
 Among its attractions are many        
 paintings and much furniture all of   
 which is original.
