		<content>Codsall and District Disabled Club was 
formed almost 20 years ago to benefit  
the handicapped living in the area.Club
meetings are held once a month and in  
the summer we have an outing to a place
of interest. Some of the members are   
severely disabled and cannot manage    
without wheelchairs. We are a happy    
Club with, we hope, a good committee   
who devote a lot of their time for the 
Members' benefit.                      
South Staffordshire Local Village      
Transport is a registered charity,     
formed to provide transport for those  
elderly, disabled or infirm residents  
of Codsall and surrounding villages who
are unable to use normal public        
transport, to enable them to attend Day
Care Centres and Clubs and enjoy       
leisure and shopping outings. We own a 
12 seater mini-bus, provided by "Help  
The Aged" in 1983.                     </content>
