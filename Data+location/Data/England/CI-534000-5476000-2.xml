		<title>02The Roman Wreck, Guernsey</title>
		<content>    The remains of a twenty metre      
 Gallo-Roman ship were discovered by   
 local diver, Richard Keen, on         
 Christmas Day 1982. Lying in the      
 St.Peter Port harbour entrance in 8   
 metres of water the site was rapidly  
 being eroded by the propeller wash of 
 cross Channel car ferries.            
    The Guernsey Maritime Trust was    
 formed and an emergency rescue        
 operation mounted under the direction 
 of archaeologist Doctor Margaret Rule,
 of Mary Rose fame.                    
    Coins and other artefacts dated the
 wreck as 2nd century A.D. The remains 
 of the heavy oak timbers and ship's   
 cargo were recovered in 1984/85.A     
 B.B.C. T.V. film of the excavation was
 screened in June 1985 entitled        
 Operation Asterix.                    
    It is planned to set up a permanent
 display in Castle Cornet.             </content>
