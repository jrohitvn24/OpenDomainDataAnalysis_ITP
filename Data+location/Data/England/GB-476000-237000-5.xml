		<title>05A Visit to Passenham</title>
		<content>Farming - Passenham is a farming       
community. Rape,wheat and barley are   
sown in the fields and cattle graze in 
the meadows. One of the main problems  
is flooding. The mill was powered by   
water and used to grind corn but it    
ceased to operate in 1920.             
  The Manor House is up for sale at the
moment. The previous owners died and it
is uncertain who is going to buy it.   
  In the grounds of the Manor House is 
a 16th Century Tithe Barn. It is still 
used for storage but now only for      
agricultural machinery.                
                                       
Religion - The church is called        
St.Guthlac's. In the mid 19th Century a
new church was built at Deanshanger. As
a result St.Guthlac's assumed less     
imporance. Today about 15-20 people    
attend. On the 2nd and 4th Sunday of   
the month is Holy Communion at 9.00a.m.</content>
