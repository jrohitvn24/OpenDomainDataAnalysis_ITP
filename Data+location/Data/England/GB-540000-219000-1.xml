		<title>01The History of Much Hadham</title>
		<content>                                       
   Much Hadham is a village steeped in 
 history. It was mentioned in the      
 Domesday Book as a great deal of the  
 land of Much Hadham was owned by the  
 Bishopric of London.                  
   At various times the village has    
 been known as Hadham Magna, Great     
 Hadham and Much Hadham but the name is
 reputed to have been derived from     
 Hadda and Ham, signifying the village 
 or home of Hadda.                     
   The earliest records of Hadham are  
 dated 946, found in the will of the   
 Saxon Queen Aelfleda, wife of King    
 Edmund. She and her sister inherited  
 land at Hadham from their father, an  
 alderman of Essex. They in turn       
 bequeathed this land to the Bishops of
 London, who built a palace, but the   
 original building no longer stands.
