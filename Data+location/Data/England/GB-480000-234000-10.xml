		<title>10Housing in Whaddon</title>
		<content> The houses of Whaddon (pop. 400) are  
 along a winding road from Horwoods to 
 Calverton. The oldest part of the     
 village, between the church &amp; Whaddon 
 Hall follows an escarpment which gives
 pleasing views to Nash in the west.   
 These older houses, mostly dating from
 the 19th century with some earlier    
 ones are built of a local brick. Their
 styles reflect the agricultural nature
 of the community with large farmhouses
 &amp; small cottages. Much conversion work
 has been done: Whaddon Hall itself is 
 now luxury flats and the gatehouses   
 and stables are private homes. On the 
 outskirts of the village are more     
 recent houses built between 1920 and  
 the 1980s. About half the total houses
 come into this category. The over-    
 riding impression is of variety: large
 detached houses, 1930s semis, council 
 &amp; elderly person dwellings.           </content>
