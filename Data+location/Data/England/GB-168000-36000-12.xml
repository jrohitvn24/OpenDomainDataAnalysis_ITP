		<title>12RELIGION IN FOUR LANES.</title>
		<content> There are two places for worship in   
 the area. The only one now in the     
 village is the church, there was until
 1982 a Methodist Chapel in the village
 but this was pulled down.Just outside 
 the village at Pencoys is a large     
 Methodist Chapel.                     
 The village has a resident vicar who  
 lives in a fairly modern vicarage     
 almost opposite the church.           
 Regular services are held in both and 
 the church runs a Sunday              
 School.However it is fair to say that 
 that neither is well attended.The     
 Chapel congregation tends to be the   
 Methodist older families of the       
 district.
