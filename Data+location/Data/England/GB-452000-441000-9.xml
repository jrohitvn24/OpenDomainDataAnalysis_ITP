		<title>09BOLTON PERCY POPULATION</title>
		<content>    Census records show the{population}
 has remained fairly constant since    
 1851 at about 300;families are smaller
 but the number of houses has tripled. 
 Since 1945 local employment has fallen
 off, causing a drift away from the    
 village.10 persons over 40 years and  
 educated locally are still resident.  
    In 1966-70 40{houses}were built    
 bringing children to the school and   
 new residents who adapted well to     
 "village life".                       
    The{cost of houses}has since risen 
 dramatically (a Â£4000 bungalow in 1966
 was sold in 1981 @ Â£34000)> In 1980 13
 houses were built at Â£60000+.The newer
 residents are either retired or       
 "excutives" who commute 30 miles to   
 work. There are fewer children for the
 school." The{"quality of village life"
 has dropped as few newcomers support  
 village activities."D.Critall.        </content>
