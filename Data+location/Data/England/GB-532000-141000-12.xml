		<content>   It's{5.00 am}and my dad is just     
 getting up to milk the cows. We have  
 got{70}cows and about{30}heifers and  
 calves.It takes about{3\}hours to milk
 them by machine.In{February, March}and
{April}it takes longer to{milk}them    
 because the cows have just had their  
 calves.In the{Autumn}it doesn't take  
 so long  because most of the cows are 
 dry, which means we don't milk them   
 for about{6 to 8}weeks before they    
 have had their calves. When he has    
 finished he hoses out the parlour.    
   If it's the{summer}then we put the  
 cows out in the field, but in the     
{winter}we feed the cows{grains}and    
{silage.                               
  {Silage}is cut grass which is stored 
 through the{Autumn}and{sprayed}to help
 to keep it. We make silage in{May} and
{August}and it takes about a week to   
 make.                                 </content>
