		<content> This estate has been growing          
 for the past 10 to 15 years and is    
 still expanding. In 1978-79 it was a  
 very bare area containing the sewerage
 works and several farms. Now it is a  
 microcosm ; a satellite town to the   
 city 3 miles away. Apart from large   
 residential areas there are also parks
 shops,schools and light industry. With
 the opening of the shopping centre, 2 
 community centres and a sports/leisure
 centre it is very much a model for the
 future.
