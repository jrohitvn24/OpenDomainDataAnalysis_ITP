		<title>03Bilborough:Where I live</title>
		<content> The area I live in is Bilborough.It   
 has a park,a few shops and a pub.The  
 pub is called The Pelican.There is    
 another pub in Strelley which I go    
 to,called the Broad Oak.The houses in 
 Bilborough are semi-detached,similar  
 to the houses of Strelley and         
 Trowell.There is a school up the road 
 called Melbury.It used to be an infant
 school but now it is a primary        
 school.Nearby is Bilborough College   
 and the William Sharp Comprehensive   
 School.They are making a new road     
 through Strelley.Nearby there are     
 fields for horses to graze in and     
 there is a lot of wildlife.I have seen
 rabbits and squirrels.                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
