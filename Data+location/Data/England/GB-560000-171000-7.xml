		<title>07Changing Times in Northfleet</title>
		<content> In 1900 the land around our school,   
 Northfleet School for Girls,was       
 mainly open fields and orchards.Since 
 then many changes have taken place.   
 Shopping centres,flats,housing estates
 and schools have been built.Many shops
 used to be houses.Large buildings have
 replaced fields and countryside.The   
 doctor's surgery in Old Perry Street  
 was a forge and the A2 was built where
 the Roman road Watling Street used to 
 be.The school adjacent to ours,       
 Northfleet Grammar, is in a building  
 called Wombwell Hall.This house,and   
 the surrounding countryside,were owned
 by Colyer Ferguson,who also owned a   
 deer park because he liked wild       
 animals.Old people in the area whom we
 spoke to felt that in the 1940s there 
 was less noise and rush and people    
 were more polite.Now there is litter, 
 high prices,traffic and vandalism.    </content>
