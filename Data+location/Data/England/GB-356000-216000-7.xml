		<content>{Bishops Wood                          
         In Bishops Wood which is in   
 square 3,we found quite a big garage, 
 it sold caravans but not cars.We found
 an 18th century house,it was in the   
 shape of a castle's battlements.We    
 also found some modern chalets. A     
 house which is owned by Mr and Mrs    
 Voight,is a Tudor house.              
                                       
{Kerne Bridge                          
        In square 4 which is Kerne     
 Bridge we found one pub which is      
 called Kerne Bridge Inn,it is a Free  
 House. There are two modern houses,   
 one has been built recently.At the    
 back of the pub,there is an old Tudor 
 house, of which the chimney is falling
 down.
