		<content> It was rebuilt with stronger          
 foundations in 1420 by a mason named  
{Roger Denys,}from London.But he had to
 use the fallen stone.This is why there
 are columned pillars on the north     
 side, (from the old church)           
 andoctagonal pillars on the opposite  
 side.                                 
   The Oak roof originally had 10      
 carved angels but only 5 remain,3 on  
 the south side and 2 on the north.A   
 new tower was built on the west end so
 there was less risk of it falling on  
 the church.                           
    In 1760 the chancel was demolished.
 the rector,{Dr John Shaw,}was having  
 his rectory(now Wyberton              
 park)improved.So he had the builders  
 to build a new chancel out of brick   
 instead of stone.
