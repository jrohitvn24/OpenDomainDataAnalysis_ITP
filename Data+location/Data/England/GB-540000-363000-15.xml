		<title>15LEGEND- CLAY'S LIGHT.</title>
		<content> Thomas Clay, a bachelor, lived in a   
 hut one mile from Saint Andrews church
 Halton Holegate and was churchwarden  
 for 1658, 1661, 1662. He walked across
 the fields to church (Clay's Walk)    
 refusing to go by road. On his death, 
 instructions were that his coffin be  
 carried Clay's Walk to church, this   
 wish being denied, his body taken by  
 road. On the evening of the funeral   
 day villagers saw a light travel Clays
 Walk, through the churchyard and      
 settle on the church tower. It was    
 said that when a village death was    
 about to occur, this light shone above
 or near the house where death was     
 imminent.                             
 RECTORY FOOTSTEPS: It was  said that  
 Dr. George  Tennyson's footsteps (a   
 visitor to Halton Rectory 1814-1831)  
 could be heard in the 1960's and 70's.
