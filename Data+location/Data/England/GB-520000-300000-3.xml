		<content> Until about 60 years ago bricks were  
 taken from the old{Dogsthorpe Railway,
 but now they travel by road.The       
 factory is owned by the{London Brick  
{Company}which has 9 sites across{     
{England.}The{Brickworks}also own{     
{Eastwood Farm}now since 1955.There    
 were originally over 100 acres but as 
 the clay pits advances,the farm is    
 decreasing.The main crop this year is 
 wheat,but last year it was oil_seed   
 rape.The farm is controlled from{     
{Yaxley}about 12 miles away,and the    
 chief market is at{Thetford.
