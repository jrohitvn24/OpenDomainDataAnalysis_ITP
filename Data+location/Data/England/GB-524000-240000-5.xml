		<title>05A MODERN DAIRY FARM ASHWELL</title>
		<content> Fewer people work on farms now,       
 machines have replaced men. Two men   
 look afer two hundred cows, milking   
 twenty at a time in a modern milking  
 parlour. Farm buildings are no longer 
 beautiful they are built machine size,
 not man size. They are made so they   
 can be used for a variety of purposes,
 a modern farmer may have to change to 
 stay in business. The cows are black  
 and white Freisians. They eat a lot of
  silage.There are two cows per acre   
 because the grass is so good. It is   
 made into silage without needing      
 additives.It is put under black       
 polythene sheets.The fields in Aswell 
 were never small because the Enclosure
 Acts were comparatively late          
 nevertheless some fields have been    
 combined. Snake's Piece, Brick Kiln   
 and Little Ten Acre have been made    
 into one and a line of trees removed. </content>
