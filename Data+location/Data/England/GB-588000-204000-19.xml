		<title>19 GOING INTO THE SECOND YEAR</title>
		<content> When you first come to The Plume      
 school you are put into a mixed       
 ability form and you are taught       
 together for all subjects. Then at the
 end of the Christmas term you are set 
 for French - there is a top set,two   
 parallel  sets and one bottom set. If 
 you are in the top set for French you 
 can choose to take a second language  
 in the second year. German and Spanish
 are offered in alternate years. In my 
 year we were offered Spanish but the  
 present First Years will be taking    
 German.                               
   There are three "populations" in    
 each year and 4 classes in each       
 population e.g.2B1;2K1;2S1;2W1.       
   At the end of the first year you are
 also set for Maths and Science. There 
 is one top set and three parallel sets
   There is no setting in some subjects
 e.g. English.   By Melanie Davis  2B3.</content>
