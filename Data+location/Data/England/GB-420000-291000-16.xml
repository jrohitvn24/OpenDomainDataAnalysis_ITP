 Mondays, Wednesdays &amp; Fridays (9.15_  
 11.45 am). A small charge is made for 
 attendance.                           
    In January 1976 children were      
 accepted at 2 years 9 months if       
 accompanied by their mother, formerly 
 the age had been 3 years. As from     
 September 1985 the age is to  be      
 lowered to 2 years.

 numbers went down to 4.

 with different media. The children    
 have an annual outing and several     
 smaller outings. Originally the       
 playgroup had 2 supervisors, now there
 is 1 supervisor and a mother to help. </content>
