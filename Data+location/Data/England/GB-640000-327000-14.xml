 Meat may be bought pre-packed at a    
 supermarket, where exact cut and      
 weight can be chosen. Fresh meat can  
 be bought at a butcher's, whilst a    
 travelling butcher visits the villages
 once or twice a week. Cooked meat and 
 sausages can be bought at the         
 delicatessen counter of a supermarket.
