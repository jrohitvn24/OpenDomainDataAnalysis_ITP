		<content> From a series of interviews with      
 elderly people of the village a       
 wealth of information was gleaned.    
 Employment has always had to be got   
 outside the survey area,notably in    
 Crewe although the coming of the Milk 
 Marketing Board factory provided some 
 employment for local people. The      
 installation of electricity and       
 erection of electric street lighting  
 had a dramatic effect on the village. 
 The population has grown and          
 subsequently the "neighbourliness" is 
 considered to have declined in the    
 opinions of the older residents.      
 Most of the land 70 years ago,was     
 farmland and cattle used to wander    
 through the village as there was no   
 main road and no traffic.There has    
 been a steady increase in population  
 and the area has become a desirable   
 residential area.                     </content>
