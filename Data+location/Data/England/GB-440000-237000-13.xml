		<title>13Broughton Village (1)</title>
		<content> Broughton is a {quiet village} one and
a half miles from North Newington and  
{two miles from Banbury}. Broughton is 
much more modernised than North        
Newington or Lower Tadmarton. The most 
important thing about Broughton is the 
{castle}.                              
Broughton is a village of peace. It is 
built on the side of a hill sloping    
down to the brook. It is only a small  
village with a {population of 400}.    
There is hardly any {Hornton Stone}    
left in Broughton. Most of the houses  
are now built of {beige brick}.        
There is a lot of grass area and on    
the hill behind the village is a       
{cemetry}. There is one {Post Office}  
 nd one {Public House} called{The      
{Saye and Sele Arms'. }I have now found
 out that the village itself has very  
 little ancient history
