		<content>   This is how an ordinary family in   
 Highcliffe would spend a Saturday.    
 In the summer they would go to the    
 beach in the morning with a picnic    
 lunch and spend the morning on the    
 beach. After this the family would    
 do the gardening and odd jobs around  
 the house. In the winter on a nice day
 they might go for a walk, perhaps past
 Highcliffe Castle and on down to the  
 beach. After this they would go home  
 and watch television or do other      
 things to amuse themselves. Next the  
 family would have their evening meal  
 or tea. This would last about         
 forty-five minutes. When tea is       
 finished, if the family did not play  
 together each person would amuse      
 himself until bed and then the        
 children would go to sleep while their
 parents watched television or read.
