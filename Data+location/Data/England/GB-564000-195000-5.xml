		<content>{Industrial Estate                     
   There is one small industrial estate
 in this area. The industrial estate is
 in the centre of Billericay,(close to 
 the railway station) in the SE of the 
 area we are covering. These small     
 factory units use modern machinery and
 make little {pollution.}They have all 
 been built in the last 20 years and   
 one is still being completed. They all
 have their own private{car parks,     
 these are mostly used by private cars 
 with a few transport lorries. All     
 these factory units are situated along
 three roads. The people who work here 
 all live locally. One or two firms    
 have taken over 2 or 3 units. There   
 are 35 units altogether.{
