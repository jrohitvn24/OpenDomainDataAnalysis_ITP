    The remaining 130 men will be      
 transferred to long-life coastal pits 
 in the east of the county.            
                                       
    A Sacriston miner has given us an  
 account of his working life.          
                                       
   He began at sixteen years of age and
 works now as a coal hewer (i.e. he    
 cuts the coal from the coal face )    
 having also worked on face            
 development.                          
                                       
   The typical working day has little  
 variation. The is one shift beginning 
 at 8am and lasting for seven and three
 quarter hours.                        
                                       
   The face workers descend in a cage  
 to the  shaft and then walk along     
 to Victoria seam.                     </content>
