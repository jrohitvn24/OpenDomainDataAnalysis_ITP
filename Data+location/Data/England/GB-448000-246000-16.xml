Most of the houses in Chipping Warden  
are made of tile and brick. Some       
consist  of slate and local stone.Most 
of the old houses are down Hogg End.   
The new estates are The Close which    
  contains 15 houses, Allens Orchard,  
which contains about 20 houses and     
Arbury Banks which contains 45 houses  
and these were built just after the    
Second World War. The oldest house in  
the village is probably Well Cottage,  
some  some parts of which are thought  
to be 15th century. There are a few    
large houses including The Manor and   
the Court House.
