		<title>19AN ADULT'S DAY</title>
		<content>  Rising with the sparrows at around   
 5am my mum lights the fire before     
 going outside to assist my dad with   
 milking the cows.Milking is finished  
 by 6.30am.She is back in the kitchen  
 at 7.15am to cook a breakfast of      
 bacon,egg,tomato,fried bread and      
 buttered toast.This is made on the    
 electric grill and ceramatic hob.A    
 quick wipe over ensures the hob is    
 kept spotless.Mum makes sure that we  
 have had a nourishing breakfast and   
 are ready for school.                 
                     Next the washing  
 is loaded into the washing machine,   
 and mum can then clear the table and  
 wash-up.At 8 o'clock she goes out into
 the dairy to sterilize the milking    
 utensils and bulkvat.The rest of the  
 day is spent cleaning the house and   
 cooking.She goes to bed at 10 o'clock.
