		<content>    The Mendips are a lovely place to  
 go horse riding. Although there are no
 riding schools in this particular     
 area, the country lanes do make a     
 pleasant hack.                        
    Gymkhanas are held at many local   
 venues including, Binegar, Emborough, 
 Charterhouse and West Pennard.        
    If you wish to join a pony club,   
 the main one is Mendip Farmers based  
 at Priddy. The local hunt is also the 
 Mendip Farmers which is likewise based
 at Priddy. Point to Point races take  
 place frequently in the spring at the 
 racecourse just to the east of Nedge  
 Hill south of Chewton Mendip.         
    Although there used to be a        
 blacksmith in Chewton Mendip until a  
 few years ago, horse owners must now  
 employ a travelling farrier.
