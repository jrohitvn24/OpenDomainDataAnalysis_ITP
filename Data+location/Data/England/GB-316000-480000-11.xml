		<title>11VISIT TO A FACTORY (1)</title>
		<content> WE WENT TO NESBITTS, A FACTORY THAT   
 MAKES NIGHTIES, PYJAMAS, QUILTED      
 DRESSING GOWNS, SWEATSHIRTS, DRESSES  
 AND SHORTS. NESBITTS ALTOGETHER HAVE  
 55 WORKERS. NESBITTS WAS OPENED IN    
 MILLOM BECAUSE THE MANCHESTER SITE WAS
 BOMBED SO THEY HAD TO FIND SOMEWHERE  
 ELSE TO OPEN THE FACTORY. THEY MOVED  
 TO MILLOM BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE IN GREAT
 NEED OF WORK. Mr NESBITT OPENED THE   
 FACTORY HERE IN 1944. THEY CALLED THE 
 FACTORY NESBITTS AFTER THE MAN WHO    
 OWNED IT.HE IS NOW DEAD. THE FACTORY  
 IS OPEN FROM 7_30am TO 4_00pm. IT HAS 
 A LOT OF MACHINES LIKE THE CUTTER,    
 PRINTER, SEWING, OVERLOCK, STEAM IRON,
 BUTTON HOLER AND THE BAGGING MACHINES.
 THEY SELL ONE THIRD OF THEIR WORK TO  
 CATALOGUES, ONE THIRD OF THEIR WORK   
 GOES TO WHOLESALERS AND 1 THIRD GOES  
 TO CHAIN STORES. ALL THE WORKERS ARE  
 PAID A PRICE FOR EACH JOB.            </content>
