		<title>07People of Maesbrook Village</title>
		<content>     In our group we asked some people 
 of Maesbrook some questions about what
 they thought of the village and the   
 surrounding towns.  These are the main
 answers we got.                       
     Most of the people we interviewed 
 had lived in Maesbrook for over ten   
 years and most of them were in their  
 gardens when we met them.  They       
 thought that it was a pretty and      
 peaceful place to live.  However it   
 had got busier and traffic used it as 
 a short cut past Oswestry.            
     None of them would really prefer  
 to live anywhere else.                
     A few of them went to church in   
 Maesbrook and one woman did decorating
 there.  Not many went to the          
 Blackhorse pub, they preferred to go  
 to other pubs outside the area.
