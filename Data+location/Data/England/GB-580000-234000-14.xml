		<title>14    The Round Church</title>
		<content>  At{Lt.Maplestead}there is a round    
 church, one of only five in England,  
 built ain 1335 by the{Knights         
{Hospitallers,}as a copy of the Church 
 of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.   
 The village and church were given to  
 the Knights Hospitallers by Julian    
 Fitz-Audelin c.1185. The Knights      
 Hospitallers had set up a hospital in 
 Jerusalem to care for pilgrims, and a 
 hospital was built at Lt. Maplestead  
 to care for the sick in this country. 
 Henry V111 closed all religious houses
 and monasteries in 1540 but because   
 the Round Church was used by people in
 the village it was allowed to remain. 
 The Knights lost all their lands and  
 they were given to a family called    
 Wiseman.There are still Wisemans in   
 the village-Richard is a pupil at     
 our school and Mrs.Wiseman is our mid-
 day assistant.                        </content>
