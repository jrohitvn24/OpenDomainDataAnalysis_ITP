		<title>16MOLE CATCHERS</title>
		<content> Mole catchers in Chester Moor are very
 busy in the high season.Moles are very
 vicious creatures.They are web-footed 
 with small,but very sharp teeth.Mole  
 catching in Chester Moor started in   
 1950.In those days the traps were two 
 old pence for ten and were very       
 strong.Trappers poison lawns and set  
 the traps up near the holes with a    
 little bit of bait.The local mole     
 catcher,as a young lad,caught rabbits 
 and from this his interest grew.Local 
 people first  asked him to rid their  
 land of moles and since then he has   
 regularly helped out in the           
 neighbourhood.
