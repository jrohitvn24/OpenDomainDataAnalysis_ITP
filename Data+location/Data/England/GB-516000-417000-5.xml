		<title>05Farming and Industry</title>
		<content> Farming is{not a major activity}in the
 area. Most of the land is used for    
 industry. The land that is used for   
 farming is{owned by the large oil }   
{refineries}and rented out to two      
 farmers, one from Kelsey and one from 
 Stallingborough this land is used for 
 growing{wheat and barley}with some    
 field used for{grazing cattle.}It is  
 a strange sight to see this farmland  
 so close to the industries. Much of   
 the land was once marsh and has been  
 drained for farm use but in recent    
 years industry has taken over. There  
 is however one farmer who actually    
 lives in the area and farms the land  
 for himself. George Tuplin has 9 acres
 in a narrow strip along Station Road. 
 His farm is a smallholding rather than
 a farm.
