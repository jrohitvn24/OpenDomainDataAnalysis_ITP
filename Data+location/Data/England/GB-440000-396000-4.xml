		<content>     Rawmarsh Comprehensive School was 
 completed on January 1, 1931, and was 
 then called Rawmarsh New Council      
 School. It became co-educational in   
 1963 and a comprehensive in 1974.     
     It has seven 'feeder' schools,    
 Monkwood, Rosehill, Ashwood, Sandhill,
 Thorogate, St.Joseph's and St.Mary's. 
     There are{1,030}pupils on roll and
{61}staff. The school will get smaller 
 in the next five years but will then  
 grow in numbers during the 1990s.     
     One of the main developments in   
 education is{'Curriculum Enquiry'}as  
 schools look at what they teach and   
 how subjects are taught.              
     There is also to be a new examin- 
 ation called the{G.C.S.E.}which will  
 replace the G.C.E.'O' Level, the      
 C.S.E. and the joint 16-plus examin-  
 ations. The first courses will begin  
 in September,1986.                    </content>
