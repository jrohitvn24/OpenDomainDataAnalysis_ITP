		<title>17Bookham's Village Magazine</title>
		<content> The{Bookhams Bulletin}was first pub-  
 lished by Leatherhead Social Services 
 in 1931 with theaim of informing the  
 village of local events. During WW2 it
 was used to publish, explain &amp; advise 
 on Government regulations.            
                                       
 In 1949 it was taken over by the BCA, 
 who published articles of general     
 interest to the village and a list of 
 groups &amp; clubs with contacts. Over the
 years the format has changed, but its 
 value to residents, particularly new  
 ones, remains.                        
                                       
 Mrs Harrison,MA, founder of the BCA   
 was its most distinguished editor and 
 carried out the job for 20 years.     
                                       
 4000 copies are published quarterly &amp; 
 distributed free to every house. They 
 are subsidised by adverts &amp; the BCA.  </content>
