		<content> THE SURVEY OF PEOPLE DRINKING AND     
 EATING IN THE PUB DURING A TUESDAY    
 LUNCH TIME SHOWED THEY ALL CAME FROM  
 AT LEAST THREE MILES AWAY.EIGHT OF THE
 TWENTY FIVE WERE HOLIDAY MAKERS.THIS  
 MEANS A LOT OF CARS HAVE TO DRIVE     
 THROUGH NARROW LANES TO THE           
 PUB,ALTHOUGH THERE IS GOOD PARKING    
 SPACE AT THE PUB.THERE IS A JUKE BOX  
 IN THE PUB.WE ASKED HOUSEHOLDERS      
 LIVING NEARBY IF THEY HAD ANY         
 COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE NOISE AND        
 TRAFFIC.THEY ANSWERED THAT THE PUB    
 CLIENTS WERE VERY WELL BEHAVED.THE    
 LOCAL POLICEMEN TOLD US HE HAD HAD NO 
 TROUBLE OR DISTURBANCE.
