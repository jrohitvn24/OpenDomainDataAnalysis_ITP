		<title>13POPULATION OF LINTON</title>
		<content>  During the first half of this century
 the population of Linton was almost   
 static.But since World War 2 the      
 population has increased rapidly,the  
 biggest increase being within the last
 twenty years.Eg.population in 1961    
 1,813.In 1971 it was 2,627.In 1981 it 
 was 4,110.This large expansion of the 
 village would seem to be linked with  
 the fact that Linton is no longer just
 serving the local area but is a       
 dormitory village serving London,     
 Cambridge,Saffron Walden etc.This in  
 turn is connected with the improvement
 in transport.Eg.the building of the   
 M11 to London.                        
  This year(1985)there have been 18    
 deaths,6 weddings and 11 babies born. 
  All of the 25 people interviewed     
 lived in Linton,24% work in Linton.
