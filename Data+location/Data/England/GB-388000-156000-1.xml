		<title>01HISTORY GENERAL INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content> The area covered by this survey is a  
 mainly rural area in which is the     
 village of Steeple Ashton, part of the
 village of Keevil and a small part of 
 the hamlet of Great Hinton.At one     
 time, most of the area belonged to    
 the Long family who had its home in   
 the area (Steeple Ashton Manor and    
 Rood Ashton).                         
      There is a mixture of farming,   
 arable,dairy and beef:some sheep and  
 pigs are kept: There are also chicken 
 farms.There are a few small haulage   
 firms in the area and other small     
 businesses. Although some people work 
 in the villages most commute to work, 
 some as far as London.                
     It is a popular area in which to  
 live as the villages themselves are   
 not on any main road &amp; therefore quiet
 and peaceful,but within easy reach of 
 nearby towns.                         </content>
