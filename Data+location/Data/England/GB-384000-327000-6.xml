		<title>06CHEBSEY - THE VICAR'S DAY</title>
		<content> The present Vicar of Chebsey rises    
 usually at 7.30am, and on week days   
 says Matins at the Vicarage.  After   
 breakfast he deals with correspondence
 and attends meetings.  In the         
 afternoons he is mainly occupied with 
 visiting in one of his three          
 parishes.  Sometimes he does duties in
 his capacity as a Prebendary at       
 Lichfield Cathedral for which post he 
 is entitled to wear a long black      
 cassock with red trim and buttons.  He
 generally says Evensong at the        
 Vicarage.  In the evenings the vicar  
 may write a letter for the monthly    
 Parish News, prepare candidates for   
 confirmation or preside at a          
 discussion group.  Most Sundays he    
 takes a service in each of his three  
 parishes.
