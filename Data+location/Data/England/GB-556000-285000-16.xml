		<title>16THE LITTLEPORT BY-PASS</title>
		<content> The{by-pass}to take traffic round Ely 
 and Littleport was announced in 1983, 
 the cost has risen from Â£3,7000,000 to
 Â£7,250,000 due to the raw materials   
 and it is to be finished in 1986.     
 Traffic going between Kings Lynn,     
 Cambridge and London on the{A10 trunk 
{road}clog up the narrow roads of      
 Littleport and Ely at present.        
 Three alternative routes were offered 
 and the one chosen avoids passing over
 subsiding fen soil and involves no    
 demolition of property. It passes from
 Ely to the West and North of the      
 village, meeting the A10 again at the 
 new Littleport Bridge over the river. 
 It will make{traffic}lighter in       
 Littleport, reduce the{accident rate  
 and{noise levels.                     
 A new by-pass and no secondary school,
 both in 1986, will make Littleport    
 much quieter!                         </content>
