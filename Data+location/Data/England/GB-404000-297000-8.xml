		<title>08Microwave Cookers</title>
		<content> Out of the 26 people in our class     
 (Mrs. Wilson's), {6 had microwaves and
{10 people had electric cookers.       
{15 people had gas cookers.}There are  
 more gas cookers. A Microwave is a    
 thing with a special light. There is  
 a bell to let you know when it has    
 finished. A microwave heats your      
 dinner if it has gone cold. A         
 microwave will also defrost your      
 bread if it has been in the freezer.  
 It takes about three minutes.
