 This is the Public House which sits   
 atop the ridge on the Southwest side  
 of the valley on the A41 Road.        
                                       
 It serves Customers from both         
 Shotteswell and Warmington Villages   
 being positioned midpoint and some .5 
 miles distance from the centre of both
 in some isolation.                    
                                       
 It's history is interesting because   
 the current Ordnance Survey Map       
 represents it as the "HARE and HOUNDS"
 a name that was changed many years ago
 by a previous owner was a Wheelwright 
 and ran his business from there at the
 same time as being the Publican.
