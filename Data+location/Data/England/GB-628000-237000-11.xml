		<content> Farmed land bears little relation to  
 farm names as some original farm      
 houses have been sold off and are now 
 inhabited by persons not connected    
 with farming, such as Red House farm, 
 Lower farm no longer exists. The      
 Farmhouse at Rue's farm has been      
 demolished, but a new set of building 
 have recently been erected on the     
 site, to house livestock.             
 The marshes on both sides of the River
 Deben have been drained enabling      
 intensive farming to be carried out.  
 On the area north of the river in the 
 parish of Ramsholt this year several  
 acres of oil seed rape was grown.     
 Church Farm, Kirton, owner occupied,  
 is a mixed farm. Its main crops are   
 Barley for malting, Wheat for food and
 Sugar beet which is sent to the       
 Ipswich Sugar factory.Beef cattle and 
 pigs are reared .No Labour employed.  </content>
