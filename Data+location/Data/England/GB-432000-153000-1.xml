		<title>01Vernham Dean Civil Parish</title>
		<content>  The area is a sparsely populated     
 rural area of outstanding beauty      
 situated in the north-west corner of  
 Hampshire two miles from the Berkshire
 border, with a small portion in       
 Wiltshire. The area comprises parts of
 the parishes of Vernham Dean,         
 Hurstbourne Tarrant, Tangley and Chute
 but includes only part of the village 
 of Upton and approximately twenty     
 other scattered dwellings.            
  The people are mainly employed in    
 agriculture or work in the nearby     
 towns.                                
  The area is served by a daily bus    
 service to Andover 8 miles distant and
 is convenient to the M3 and the M4 for
 access to Swindon, Reading,           
 Southampton, Salisbury, London or the 
 West. A railway line linking Exeter   
 and London passes through Andover.
