		<content> The 40th anniversary of V.E.day was   
 celebrated with services and then     
 wartime music and an open-air disco on
 the market place.Many people described
 their wartime memories in the papers. 
 Different ethical standards were      
 reflected by two headlines:One        
 featured a Spring fair held at the    
 town hall to aid the mayors charity,  
 the mentally handicapped;two weeks    
 later the headlines were neighbours'  
 opposition to the opening of a new    
 home for the mentally handicapped.    
   The other main theme of letters,    
 during the period,was whether or not  
 the Ripon Hornblower should restrict  
 his horn-blowing to purely "civic"    
 affairs,or should be allowed to open  
 galas etc.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
