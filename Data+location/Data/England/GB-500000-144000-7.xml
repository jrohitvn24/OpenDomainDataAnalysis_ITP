		<content>    Many picturesque cottages and      
 period residences may still be seen in
 the village of Wonersh,some of which  
 date from the time when it was a      
 thriving clothing centre.The parish   
 church was partly destroyed by fire in
 1793,but was restored and retains     
 numerous interesting features.The     
 oldest parts of the church are the    
 Saxon nave wall and the Norman tower  
 base.Also to be noticed are the 15th  
 century brasses.                      
   The main street in Wonersh,The      
 Street, is dotted with many           
 architectural masterpieces,including  
 the 14th century coaching inn,the     
 Grantley Arms.Wonersh also houses     
 several medieval private residences.  
 Great Tangley Manor surrounded by a   
 moat,is a splendid half-timbered and  
 gabled Elizabethan residence.
