		<title>16Wildlife changes near Alford</title>
		<content> There has been a drastic decline in   
 the butterfly population with the     
 woodland fritillaries now completely  
 extinct. No one is sure why, pollution
 and climatic changes are two factors  
 frequently blamed. A climatic change  
 has been evident since the 1940's with
 animals attracted here that were never
 normally seen. The collared dove is   
 now a common bird, almost a pest. The 
 red squirrel has gone, again no one   
 knows why, replaced by the imported   
 grey squirrel.                        
  The greatest single change in the    
 landscape since the 1970's is the     
 total removal of the Elm tree by Dutch
 Elm Disease.                          
  The Lincs and S.Humberside Trust have
 several reserves managed on the       
 traditional lines once common. They   
 are replanting trees and encouraging  
 the return of plants and animals.     </content>
