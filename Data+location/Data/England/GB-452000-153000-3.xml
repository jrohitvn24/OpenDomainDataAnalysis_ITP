		<content>}The village has its milk delivered    
 daily  by the local Jobs Dairy motor  
 van _ the electric milk float general_
 ly used in &amp; around Basingstoke is not
 strong enough to cope with the terrain
 _ Sunday's milk is delivered with the 
 Saturday quota but the Milkman is kept
 busy on Sundays delivering newspapers 
 only.  There are three boxes in the   
 village for outgoing letters which are
 collected twice daily and once on Sat_
 urday at the same time as the Postman 
 brings the mail. Our one telephone box
 is situated outside our only Public   
 House. Opposite, is the village hall, 
 where the Post Office Officials come  
 once a week for one hour to allow the 
 villagers to collect Pensions etc.,   
 A travelling library calls once a week
 also mobile shop services.
