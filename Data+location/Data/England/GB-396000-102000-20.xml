		<content>{THE MOORS.}In 1086 these moors were   
 common land of the Royal Manor of     
 Wimborne. After the enclosures they   
 remained common land with various     
 people and institutions holding       
 grazing rights. In 1948 these rights  
 were no longer economic so a          
 management committee was formed which 
 now lets the use of the moors to local
 right holders for a rent which is then
 apportioned to the right holders in   
 lieu of rights.                       
                                       
{BADBURY LODGE.}This dates from the    
 late 15th or early 16th cent. It was  
 probably built using the derelict     
 manor house as a quarry. Its purpose  
 was as a royal hunting lodge on the   
 southern edge of Cranborne Chase as   
 the manor house had moved to Canford, 
 too far from the hunting. It is now   
 held by the National Trust.           </content>
