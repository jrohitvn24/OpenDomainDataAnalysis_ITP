		<title>06SAND QUARRYING:JOSEPH ARNOLD</title>
		<content> The{Sand Industry}dominates the area. 
 The history of one company is typical.
                                       
 Formed in 1860 by John Arnold we know 
 very little about the early days      
 except that the sand was{excavated}by 
 pick and shovel. The 1914/18 war saw  
 the rise of local sand's importance.  
                                       
 Transport costs, particularly due to  
 costs of repairing local roads, led to
 the construction of a 2 foot gauge    
{light railway}to connect with the     
{London Midland &amp; Scottish}railway.    
                                       
 By 1930 the company owned many        
 quarries in the area. It is still     
 active today.                         
                                       
 The sand is so pure that it is the    
 basis of{International Standards.
