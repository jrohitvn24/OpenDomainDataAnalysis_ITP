		<title>13A FARM NEAR WELLS NORFOLK</title>
		<content>                                       
   New Farm consists of 1263 acres, 972
acres of arable and 291 acres of grass.
Another 300 acres are hired.           
   Over 1000 bullocks are kept for     
fattening, 250 cows for the dairy herd 
and calf breeding and a flock of 1000  
sheep. 24 men are employed and they use
a lot of machinery:                    
   Tractors include 9 Marshalls, 6     
Leylands, 2 Renaults and 1 Nuffield and
there are 2 Sanderson Teleporter       
forklifts.                             
   Crops include barley for malting and
both barley and wheat are used as      
animal feed stuff.  Sugar beet goes to 
Kings Lynn for processing. Carrots,    
cabbages and sprouts are the most      
important crops handled at the farm's  
vegetable station and then taken to    
market in the farm lorries. During the 
summer hay and silage are made.        </content>
