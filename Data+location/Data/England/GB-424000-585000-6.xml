		<content>  During the 1920s there were 5 cinemas
 in Ashington.There were also several  
 dance halls and theatres.By the late  
 1970s only two remained and by 1983   
 they had both been closed down.Fruit  
 machines and a snack bar have replaced
 The Wallaw and the empty shell of the 
 other is used as a warehouse.As far as
 modern entertainment in Ashington goes
 there are several pubs and a leisure  
 centre.There is also a cricket club,a 
 rugby club and a football club.The    
 pavillion is still open but is only   
 used as a bingo hall.You may think    
 that there is ample entertainment in  
 Ashington but most of the things I    
 have mentioned are only for older     
 people.There is very little on offer  
 for the younger generation.
