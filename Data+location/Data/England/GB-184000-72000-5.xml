		<content> We looked in the oldest{LOG BOOK.     
 We found that then school was alot    
 different.The school was smaller      
 than it is now.In 1895 there were only
 two class rooms and now there are     
 four.In 1895 children stayed in the   
 first class until they were 11 years  
 when they moved into the class        
 until they were 14 years when most    
 children's formal education ended.    
 Most of the children became           
 agricultural workers because most of  
 the area was farmland .School was     
 closed when the farms where busy eg.  
 at potato harvest.                    
 Discipline was a lot stricter because 
 it says in the{LOG BOOK}that two boy  
 where sent to court because they did  
 not attend school enough times .The   
 cane was often used for punishment.   
                                       
                                       </content>
