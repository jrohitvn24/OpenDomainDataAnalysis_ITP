		<title>07ST.MARY'S CHURCH, NONINGTON.</title>
		<content>  On Friday we went to the church in   
 Nonington.The vicar Mr. Hawkins took  
 us. First of all we saw the font. This
 is where people are christened. The   
 font is as near as the door as        
 possible as this is a symbol of       
 entering the Church.                  
  Next we sat on some pews, then we    
 went on to the organ where Mr. Hawkins
 played some notes for us.In the vestry
 we saw where the vicar changes into   
 his robes. Also in the  vestry are the
 bell ropes and we all had a pull and  
 made the bells ring.                  
  Then we saw a kind of goblet, it is  
 called a chalice and it dates back to 
 the time of Queen Elizabeth 1.        
  Outside in the churchyard is a       
 memorial to all those people who died 
 in the two World Wars.
