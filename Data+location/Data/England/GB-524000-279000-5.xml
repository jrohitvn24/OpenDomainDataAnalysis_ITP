		<title>05Rural Life in Great Raveley</title>
		<content> In this county, life is essentially   
 rural and revolves around farming.    
 Home life and domestic activities in a
 farm at Great Raveley are described as
 an example for the whole area.  The   
 farmer's household comprises his own  
 wife and children and sometimes his   
 parents. If this is not possible his  
 parents will live in a house nearby,  
 The farmer's household will also      
 include family pets such as dogs,     
 cats, rabbits and even lambs.  The    
 family help with some farmwork such as
 milking cows, rearing poultry, and    
 pheasants.  Domestic activities       
 include preparation of food, like     
 baking bread and cakes, jams, pickles,
 chutney, wine making, growing fruit   
 and vegetables and craftwork, like    
 knitting and sewing.  Entertainment in
 the home mostly revolves around       
 television.                           </content>
