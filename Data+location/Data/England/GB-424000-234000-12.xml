		<title>12Clubs in the Wolfords</title>
		<content> Todenham village revolves round the   
 Farriers Arms - weekly domino matches 
 against Little Compton, and a newly   
 founded 7-team darts league, serving a
 twenty mile radius. The annual village
 fete raises over a thousand pounds.   
 The Village hall runs monthly Whist   
 drives, dances and Christmas Bingo.   
 Great Wolford has a conservative      
 association, a thriving new bell      
 ringing team and the Fox and Hounds   
 serves good food and drink. Little    
 Wolford Village hall runs Whist       
 drives, and an annual auction and     
 sponsered walk and has various lets   
 for jumble sales, coffee mornings,    
 parties, harvest suppers and          
 elections. Both Wolfords join together
 for Women's Institute and over 60's   
 activities and together with Todenham 
 go outside for Mother's Union, Cubs,  
 Brownies and Flower club.             </content>
