		<content> Stanhoe &amp; Barwick has two places of   
 worship, the late 13th century parish 
 church of All Saints and the Methodist
 Church built in 1892.  A former       
 nonconformist building of 1827 is     
 still standing.  Except for the years 
 between 1963 and 1970 the church has  
 been administered since 1221 by a     
 Rector but 1985 has seen a change and 
 the parish has been amalgamated with  
 its three near neighbours, Bagthorpe, 
 Bircham and Docking with one          
 Priest-in-Charge of all four.  Though 
 small there is still an active        
 Mothers' Union.  The Methodist Church 
 is served by a Superintendent, a      
 Minister and local Preachers and has a
 Sunday School.  Both the Parish and   
 the Methodist Church have recently    
 undergone major restoration, the cost 
 being met impartially by the village.
