		<content> There is variety in the type of homes 
 but most are built with Cotswold stone
 which was quarried locally. Recently  
 built houses are of reconstructed     
 Cotswold stone produced in factories. 
 Rooves are Cotswold stone tiles, some 
 with wooden lintels. Most of the      
 semi-detached houses have porches. The
 oldest houses date to the 15th century
 and were part of the old manor. 1     
 dwelling only in Rodmarton is less    
 than 10 years old (this was permitted 
 because the occupier was an invalid   
 needing a bungalow).Houses in the     
 block were counted and there were 24  
 detached houses or houses on their    
 own,16 pairs of houses or 32 semi -   
 detached houses with a communal wall, 
 4 terraces with more than 2 houses    
 joined together,4 farms and 5 caravans
 which were homes for travelling       
 families on a permanent site.         </content>
