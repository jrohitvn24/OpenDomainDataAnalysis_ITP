		<title>09Footpaths in Fairfield</title>
		<content> Mr Must came to give us a talk and he 
 took us for a walk. Footpaths are used
 for walking on if you have not got a  
 car. They are very useful for getting 
 home from work, to go to farms, for   
 going shopping and for short cuts. The
 country code is used for keeping the  
 countryside tidy. It sys not to play  
 on the roads and footpaths, dogs must 
 be kept on leads, do not throw your   
 litter about, keep gates shut, never  
 pick wild flowers. There are 30       
 footpaths in Fairfield. The County    
 Council look after the footpaths and  
 the Ramblers Association help too.    
 Some farmers plough the fields and put
 barbed wire and electric fences across
 the paths. We walked down path 82, up 
 Swan Lane and back to school along    
 footpath 82a.
