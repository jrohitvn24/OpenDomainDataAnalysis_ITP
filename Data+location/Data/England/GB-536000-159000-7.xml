		<title>07Milne Park</title>
		<content>In Milne Park cars make holes on the   
fields by skidding and spinning.Also   
the swing park isn't a swing park any  
more because there are no swings.They  
have been taken down because people    
complain of the noise and now there is 
a rocket that rocks and still people   
complain of the noise.There is a field 
that hardly gets used only at weekends 
for football and a fair that comes up  
once a year but then the park is full  
of action with dodgems and rides,side- 
shows for the whole of May Bank        
Holiday weekend.There is horse riding  
and football competitions and a        
carnival on Monday and the whole area  
is lit up at night but then the fair   
moves on,leaving Milne Park once again 
quiet and deserted.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
