		<content> When I play out with my friends we    
 play at things like take-off or we    
 play in the park near our house.To    
 play take-off you have a team of girls
 and a team of boys.The girls run first
 and the boys have  to catch  them and 
 tig them three times on the head.Then 
 they take them to their home base when
 every one  is captured it is the boys 
 turn to run.Sometimes we just hang    
 around the shops or sit on a wall and 
 talk.My friends names are             
 Nicola,Mark,Stephen and sometimes     
 Rachel,Darren and Brian.Sometimes the 
 boys play football in the park field, 
 while we just sit around doing        
 nothing.My friends are fantastic.     
  Organised activities take place at   
 NORMANTON COMMUNITY CENTRE,these      
 include Disco, Gym club, Karate,Ballet
 etc .The centre is a meeting place for
 pensioner groups.                     </content>
