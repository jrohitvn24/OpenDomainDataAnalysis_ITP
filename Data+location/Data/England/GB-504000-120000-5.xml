		<title>05RIVER ARUN, NORTH PULBOROUGH</title>
		<content>  The river Arun flows through pastures
 in the north west corner of this      
 block. Under normal weather conditions
 the river is shallow but after heavy  
 rain there is major flooding over the 
 surrounding meadows and the line of   
 the river cannot be seen.             
  This peaceful stretch in the middle  
 reaches attracts a wide variety of    
 bird life; swans ducks and a heron    
 were seen during our visit. The owners
 of the adjacent Toat House reported   
 that otters and mink were also        
 present.                              
  The Horsham Angling Society rent this
 reach of the river.                   
  The river is the boundary between the
 parishes of Pulborough and Wisborough 
 Green.
