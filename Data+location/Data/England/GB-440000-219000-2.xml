		<content>Six girls from the primary school      
cultivate a vegetable plot as a market 
garden project.They record the progress
of their weekly work and keep accounts.
At the end of each growing season they 
sell their produce to the village store
and direct to villagers.All profit is  
sent to Mrs.Hirsh's son at Mok Taew    
school in Thailand.Mrs.Hirsh is the    
owner of the garden.The money is used  
to buy seed and petrol for a           
two-wheeled iron buffalo tractor.The   
money also allowed Mok Taew children to
plant twice a year especially          
maize,runner beans and other           
vegetables.                            
The children have exchanged photographs
of each others' work and plan to       
exchange tapes in each others'         
languages.
