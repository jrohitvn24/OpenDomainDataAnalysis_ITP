		<content>  In the Kington area there are several
 farms, mostly small family farms,     
 ranging in size from 50 to 125 acres. 
 Most farms rear sheep and cows. Sheep 
 are sold to market as weaning lambs,  
 fat lambs, hogs, yearlings, ewes or   
 rams. Cattle are sold at 6-12 months  
 or 12-18 months. There are a few dairy
 farms which sell their milk locally.  
 One farm rears hens on a battery      
 basis. Around June sheep are sheared. 
 In winter the weather is bad with a   
 lot of snow and the animals are hard  
 to feed. Harvesting starts in June,   
 when hay and silage are made. Root    
 crops are also grown for sheep. Other 
 crops grown include black currants and
 potatoes. Many local people pick and  
 sort potatoes. One farm uses part of  
 its land to process sewage and        
 industrial waste.
