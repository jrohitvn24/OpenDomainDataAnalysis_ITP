		<title>04Long Barrow At Notgrove</title>
		<content> The Long Barrow of Notgrove, now      
 grassed over, is a Neolithic Tomb of  
 the Severn-Cotswold group and was used
 for collective burials about 2000BC.  
 It has a central gallery with two     
 pairs of side chambers built of large 
 stones and a buried circular stone.   
 Several human skeletons and Neolithic 
 pottery excavated are now in          
 Cheltenham Museum. The Monument is now
 in the care of the Ministry of Works. 
 Admission is free to the site.        
                                       
 Analysis of charcoal found at this    
 site revealed that Ash, Cherry, Elm   
 and Hazel grew in this area 4000 years
 ago. The presence of the Hazel nuts   
 gives rise to the name of the nearby  
 village of Notgrove.
