		<title>08Mr.Judge-The Honey Man</title>
		<content>   22 years ago Mr.Judge kept hives of 
 bees in his garden.Now he employs 13  
 people in his factory.                
   Most of the honey is  now imported  
 from Australia,Mexico and many other  
 countries.The honey is warmed and     
 mixed in vats to produce clear or set 
 honey.It is poured into jars,lids put 
 on and labelled by machine.The jars   
 are then packed in dozens,crated and  
 stored ready for delivery to shops and
 supermarkets.1008 dozen jars are      
 processed every day.The honey is sent 
 all over the country and there are    
 some export orders.Mr.Judge now       
 bottles 25 different brands of honey. 
   Because of healthier eating habits  
 the demand for honey is increasing all
 the time and Mr.Judge has plans for   
 extending his factory and improving   
 quality control of his product.His two
 sons are now employed in the business.</content>
