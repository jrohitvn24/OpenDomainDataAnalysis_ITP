		<title>17Making Music</title>
		<content>    One of my interests is playing the 
 cornet in the Lydney Town Band. My    
 position is 2nd. or 3rd. cornet. I    
 also take part in open competitions   
 and have won top places in some and   
 also had commendations. I have made   
 lots of friends through music.        
    At school I am learning to play the
 flute. My teacher is called Miss Tate 
 but after the holidays she will be    
 Mrs. Young. I am hoping to join the   
 local youth orchetra soon. My         
 favourite piece of music is "Sheep May
 Safely Graze" by J.S. Bach.           
    My instrument is the piano. I am   
 having lessons privately with a local 
 teacher called Mrs. Mills. I have been
 learning for two years and I have just
 taken my Grade 1 exam.                
    At school 11 play the violin, 2 a  
 cello, 6 a flute, 6 a clarinet, one a 
 trombone,2 a cornet and 7 the piano.  </content>
