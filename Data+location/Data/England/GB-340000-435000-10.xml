		<content> Dairy farming is the principal        
 industry in this block.  The dairy    
 cattle are predominently Friesian plus
 Ayrshires and Holsteins.  A small     
 amount of hay is made  but most grass 
 is cropped as silage.  A fairly large 
 amount of nitrogen is used to ensure  
 two or three crops.  There are modern 
 milking parlours, dairies and slurry  
 handling methods.  Farmers are made   
 very aware of pollution from silage   
 and animal effluent.  There are severe
 penalties.  The use of machinery means
 farms are not so labour intensive.    
 Old buildings have been demolished and
 replaced by spacious ones of steel    
 framimg with cladding so that tractors
 are handled indoors, silage clamps    
 made and cattle loose housed.  Some   
 sheep and beef cattle are reared and  
 fattened but very ferw pigs.  The     
 grassland overall is well managed.    </content>
