		<content>        BYRAM ESTATE FARM              
                                       
   Mr Macloy's farm is called Byram    
 Estate. The land is better than some, 
 but it still needs a lot of work and  
 fertiliser. The main crops are        
 barley, wheat, rape and potatoes.     
  There are 4000 pigs, 75,000 ducks, 20
 cows and 14 horses. The pigs and ducks
 are reared in sheds. There are 8,500  
 ducks in each shed. The cows were out 
 to pasture and the horses are a hobby.
  There is one combine harvester and 12
 tractors with many trailers and       
 attachments. He has 24 employees on   
 his farm.                             
   Mr Macloy's main problems currently 
 are vandalism, theft and subsidence,  
 which causes drainage problems.
