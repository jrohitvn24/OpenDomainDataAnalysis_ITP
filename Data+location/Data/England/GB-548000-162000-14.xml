		<title>14A Country Walk</title>
		<content> Yesterday we went on a country walk   
around Chelsfield Village.We set off   
from school,crossed {Buck's Cross Road}
passed the {Old Post Office} and over  
to the Village Hall and the playing    
fields.We crossed over the cricket     
pitch and walked into the fields on the
other side.We saw all sorts of wild    
flowers such as Cow Parsley on one     
side and the village allotments on the 
other.We climbed over a stile passed a 
hawthorn bush and came to some farmland
where rows of strawberries had been    
planted.                               
 This was {Hewitts Farm} where they    
sell their fruit and produce to the    
public. We also came across an orchard 
of plum trees and some unripe apple    
trees.Besides the fruit we saw two     
goat,two donkeys and some geese on a   
pond.There was also a big black bull   
in a field close by.                   </content>
