 The village has an established        
 agricultural tradition with a recent  
 overlay of small industry on two      
 sites, one near the windmill and the  
 other on the High Street.             
                                       
 The old village centre is situated    
 around the village green and          
 St.Andrew's church.Gradually the      
 village grew.In the 19th  century     
 rows of farm workers cottages were    
 built.Most 20th century development is
 post 1945 with the infilling of       
 undeveloped plots and the building of 
 peripheral small scale estates of     
 twenty to thirty brick built houses   
 largely out of keeping with both the  
 style and traditional yellow and dark 
 red colour of the local brick.
