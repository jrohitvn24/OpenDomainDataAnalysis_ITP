		<title>10OLD FOLK IN WARBOYS</title>
		<content> The Royal British Legion flats were   
 opened to accomodate pensioners who   
 have been in the services.They are    
 warden controlled with alarm cords.The
 oldest person is 92,the youngest is   
 60.We interviewed two of the tenants. 
   {Miss Bateman.}She has lived in     
 Warboys for 75 years.Her father was an
 odd job man at the Manor House.       
  She used her bike but she still      
 remembered the trains coming to       
 Warboys.                              
         {Mrs Smith.}She said there    
 were 16 public houses and 3 windmills.
 Her father was a shepherd and owned   
 200 sheep.Today people don't keep many
 animals and most farms are arable.{   
{Mrs. Smith}said that she had to take  
 her own kettle and cocoa to school for
 her dinner.                           
 Today there are only 2 pubs and the   
 windmills have been knocked down.     </content>
