		<content>The Springfields Estate was built 20   
years ago. The Rugeley Council built   
the houses. The streets were named     
after men who supported the working    
people of England. Wat Tyler and John  
Ball lived 600 years ago. Places like  
Catkin Walk, Bracken Way, Fernwood     
Drive and Moss Green were named after  
plants and trees. Aneurin Bevan lived  
30 years ago and is another man who    
supported the working people of        
England. The private streets were named
after people who were chairmen of the  
Rugeley Council. Rugeley's twin is in  
the United States of America and it is 
called Western Springs which is in a   
state called Illinois. In 1962 the     
Telstar satellite started and the first
people to have a conversation were Mr. 
Les Madden and Mr. Howard Knowlton. Les
Madden was my best friend Andrew's Dad.
