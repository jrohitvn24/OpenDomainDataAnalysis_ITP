		<content>   Ferring is one of the numerous      
 "ingas" settlements of the Sussex     
 coastal plain.  Original Saxon        
 Settlement was on the outcrop of      
 Highdown Hill to the north where a    
 substantial pagan cemetery was found. 
 In 765 Walhere the thane was granted  
 12 hides of land which are called     
 "Ferring" by King Osmund to build a   
 monastery.  In 791 Ealdwulf dux of the
 south Saxons granted Bishop Withun of 
 Selsey leave to build the church of   
 St. Andrew at Ferring.  In the 1086   
 Survey "Ferringes" was the demense of 
 the Bishop of Chichester.  The village
 subsequently developed as two smalll  
 farming communities, east and west    
 Ferring, the latter based around the  
 church, the former in Sea Lane.  The  
 population remained at between 200 and
 300 people for many centuries.
