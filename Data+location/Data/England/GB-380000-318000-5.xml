		<content>Heron Brook Middle School              
  Heron Brook has about 464 pupils and 
24 teachers. The age range of our      
middle school is 9-13 years. Our school
is situated in the large village of    
Gnosall about 11 kilometres west of the
county town of Stafford. The school    
draws from a wide catchment area  of   
nearly 100 square kilometres including 
the villages of Haughton, Woodseaves,  
Church Eaton and Bradley.              
  Heron Brook provides a focal point   
for the local community in a rural     
area. Its facilities are used          
frequently by local organisations. In  
turn the local community provides      
considerable support for the school.   
  Heron Brook school endeavours to meet
the needs of its pupils by providing a 
very broad curriculum. The school tries
to develop pupils' special talents and 
help them to overcome any difficulties.</content>
