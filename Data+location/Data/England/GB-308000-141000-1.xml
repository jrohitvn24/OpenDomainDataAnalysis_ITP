		<content>      The{farms}are very important in  
 this area.The farmers mostly grow     
 cereal crops, grassland and rough     
 grazing,they farm a lot of land.The   
 hills are big and overlook some very  
 beautifull views.There are many long  
 and quiet walks along the{Quantock    
{Hills.}Near to Doniford camp is a     
 railway. It runs steam trains and is a
 great tourist attraction.There is a   
 lot of tourism in our block as it is  
 near the sea.There are alot of camps  
 for hoilday makers.But there are some 
 hazzards as well like narrow and      
 twisting roads.The"walls"which lead up
 to{East Quantoxhead}are so narrow that
 cars and lorries have to drive in the 
 middle of the road.There is a small   
 village of{West Quantoxhead}in the    
 shape of a triangle.                  
      There are one or two disused     
 quarries which are quite overgrown.   </content>
