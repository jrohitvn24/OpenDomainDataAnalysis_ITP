		<title>12WINDY NOOK: SETTLEMENT</title>
		<content> Windy Nook is part of Felling and     
 stands on top of a steep hill. On a   
 clear day the view from our school is 
 impressive. Ahead of us is the        
 twisting course of the River Tyne. To 
 the North are the Simonside and       
 Cheviot Hills and to the East is the  
 North Sea. The nearest sea-side resort
 is South Shields. As Windy Nook stands
 on the top of a hill it is in an      
 exposed area, and on a windy day it is
 obvious how it was given its name.    
 Although our school is one hundred and
 two years old, the houses surrounding 
 it are modern brick built ones.       
 However, some of the houses, in the   
 area are about the same age as our    
 school. The houses are built of       
 sandstone which probably came from the
 Felling quarries. One of these        
 quarries is very close to our school, 
 but has now been filled in.           </content>
