		<title>18Health Services In Alderney</title>
		<content> Babies can be born in Alderney but    
 most of them are sent to Guernsey.    
  In an emergency patients are flown   
 out by Aurigny Air Services who always
 keep a plane here for the purpose.    
 There are up to 900 accidents a year  
 and these are dealt with in casualty. 
 There is a League of Friends who help 
 with visiting patients. The hospital  
 was rebuilt with help from the        
 Nuffield Hospital Trust and H.M. Queen
 Elizabeth laid the foundation stone.  
  The main worries for Alderney about  
 the hospital concern the large number 
 of geriatrics who occupy beds and the 
 feasiblity of a small cottage hospital
 meeting the needs of modern health    
 care. Alderney has no National Health 
 Service so that the high cost of      
 health care tends to fall on the      
 States though most people have some   
 private insurance.                    </content>
