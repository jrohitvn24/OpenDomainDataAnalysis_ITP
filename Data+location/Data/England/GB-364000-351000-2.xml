		<content>    Anyone born and bred in Nantwich is
 called a Dabber.This name comes from a
 tool used by workers in the local shoe
 factories,according to local history. 
    Today,many local people work out of
 the town but they do use Nantwich     
 shops regularly.The original{black and
{white buildings,}sandstone church and 
 wealth of history,make Nantwich a     
 centre for tourism.Recently a{town    
{crier}has been employed to walk round 
 the town and read aloud local news and
 events.                               
    Residents consider the local       
 councillors and vicars to be leading  
 members of their community and feel   
 their town has a warm,friendly        
 atmosphere.                           
    A young resident became famous in  
 the 1970's  when he swam the{English  
{Channel}at the age of 17.A plaque in  
 the local pool commemorates the swim. </content>
