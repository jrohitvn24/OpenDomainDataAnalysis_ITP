		<content> Accidents/problems occur everyday,the 
 cooks favourite is burning the cafe's 
 dinner!                               
  There is a lot of cleaning up to do  
 at the end of the day.They try to do  
 the cleaning before the shop closes at
 5:30 pm.                              
  Unsold goods are recycled.           
  Mr Hodson does the paperwork and the 
 orders.                               
  The business has done very well over 
 the last 2 years since they began     
 making some of their own produce.     
  Their day does not end when the shop 
 closes as they have to do their own   
 housework,etc, when they get home.
