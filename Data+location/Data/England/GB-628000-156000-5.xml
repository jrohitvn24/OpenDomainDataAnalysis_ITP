		<title>05GOSS HALL FARM</title>
		<content> My name is Mary Coleman and my family 
live at Goss Hall, Ash, Canterbury,    
Kent. My Dad farms this farm, Great    
Weddington, Ash and Black Pond Farm,   
Woodnesborough, in partnership with my 
grandfather. Total acreage of these    
three farms is 250 hectares (ha).      
  This year there are 140 ha of crops  
and 110 ha of grassland. The crops     
consist of 41 ha of winter wheat, 29 ha
of spring barley, 18 ha of spring oats,
27 ha of potatoes and 4 ha of Brussel  
sprouts. The 108 ha of grassland is    
used for beef production and hay.   We 
have about 400 head of cattle which    
are all kept for beef. We also have    
about 120 sheep-most of these will be  
sold to other farmers in the Autumn as 
replacements for their breeding flocks.
