		<content>     Only the extreme south west is on 
 land, the rest of the block is over   
 the sea. The rocky inter tidal zone   
 rises in a 200ft high cliff which is  
 topped by hilly farmland,             
 predominantly grassland,but some other
 crops. The Cleveland way footpath     
 passes along the coast here, very     
 popular with visitors onfoot due to   
 its close proximity to Whitby and     
 nearby caravan sites. The few         
 residents live at Ling Hill farm, and 
 also at the lighthouse. This area is  
 important to the coastal shipping as  
 it contains a lighthouse and  large   
 foghorn. The high cliffs and          
 viewpoints from the nearby hills      
 provide spectacuar views of the rugged
 and unspoilt coast line to the south  
 east which is both National parkland  
 Heritage coast and valued by visitors 
 for its lack of development           </content>
