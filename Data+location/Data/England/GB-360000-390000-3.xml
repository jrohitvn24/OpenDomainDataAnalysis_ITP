		<content> On 3rd July 1985 we visited           
 Houghton Green pumping station.Mr.    
 Peters took us down an underground    
 tunnel. We saw large pipes going down 
 100 feet to a natural underground     
 reservoir.It pumped 4.56 megalitres a 
 day.It costs 18 pounds to pump one    
 megalitre.The water is pumped 330 feet
 high.The water is processed with      
 chlorine gas.Water is kept sealed from
 the air.It is used by both domestic   
 and industrial users.It travels from  
 Delph Lane pumping station to Winwick,
 Orford,Padgate and Cinammon Brow.The  
 M6 / M62 Motorway{junction}crosses    
 over that area on the map. In case of 
 emergencies the pumping station can   
 turn on the emergency water supply.   
 The station was built in 1895.        
                                       
 Our water is very hard because of the 
 lime content.                         </content>
