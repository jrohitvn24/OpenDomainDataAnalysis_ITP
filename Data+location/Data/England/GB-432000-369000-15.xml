		<title>15THE HOLYMOORSIDE COTTON MILL</title>
		<content>    In the late 18th century a cotton  
 mill was built in Holymoorside. In    
 1833 the mill was described to be     
 stone built and three stories high.   
 Apart from a good water supply other  
 advantages were a good bridle path    
 into Chesterfield and a good cart road
 without a toll to nearby coal pits.   
 The mill was first powered by a       
 waterwheel fed from a large mill pond.
 Water was transferred from the River  
 Hipper into the pond via a small      
 channel.                              
                                       
    Today the mill pond is used for    
 fishing. Many perch and roach have    
 been introduced to keep the lake well 
 stocked. The Holymoorside Angling     
 Society uses the lake for its fishing.
 Each year the society organises a     
 fishing competition around the lake.
