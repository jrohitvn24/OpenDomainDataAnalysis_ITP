		<content> A regular bus service was withdrawn   
 years ago on the grounds of economy. A
 small firm runs a minibus to          
 Cockermouth on Friday mornings for    
 shopping. This is used by 6_8 people. 
 Most people own cars. This poses      
 problems for people, especially school
 leavers with jobs in Cockermouth.  The
 Parish Council drew up a list of      
 drivers willing to give lifts in an   
 emergency. People rely on friends. The
 roads are narrow and winding. In      
 summer, tourists unused to such roads 
 make driving dangerous. There have    
 been accidents involving injuries. The
 nearest mainline stations are at      
 Penrith and Carlisle _ both 30 miles  
 away. Maryport on the W.Cumbria line  
 is 12 miles away. National buses run  
 from Cockermouth to London and other  
 large cities.                         
                                       </content>
