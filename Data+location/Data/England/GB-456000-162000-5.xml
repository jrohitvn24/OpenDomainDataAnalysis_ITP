		<content> Our survey area is typical of wealthy 
 Conservative-voting South East        
 England. It is part of "Silicon       
 Valley" and is surrounded by growing  
 numbers of computer and peripheral    
 industries, and increasingly by the   
 headquarters of multi-national        
 companies. Despite this, unemployment 
 (at September 1985) stands at 7.9%.   
 Many of the unemployed are young male 
 school leavers for there is little    
 manual work and few apprenticeships.  
 But the majority of the people are    
 comfortably off; owner occupiers;     
 professional people. The only members 
 of the ethnic minority communities we 
 have been able to find are the        
 proprietors of a Chinese Takeaway and 
 an Indian Restaurant. A few Liberal   
 candidates have been elected to local 
 District Councils but in General      
 Elections this is safe Tory ground.   </content>
