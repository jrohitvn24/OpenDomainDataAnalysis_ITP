		<title>09FESTIVAL OF DIVALI</title>
		<content> Divali is celebrated in late  october 
 or early November by Hindus and Sikhs.
 It is the Festival of Light.  There is
 a story behind Divali about Rama and  
 Sita.  It is celebrated for their     
 homecoming from the forest after 14   
 years.                                
 The old king, Rama's father, had three
 wives and three sons.  Rama was to be 
 the next King.  One of the wives      
 wanted her son to be King so either   
 Lakshman the Queen's son became king  
 or Rama. Rama and his bride Sita were 
 banished into the forest for 14 years.
 Rama went hunting in the forest Sita  
 was left in a magic circle.  One day  
 Ravana a wicked king came and took    
 Sita away.  Rama asked Hunuman the    
 monkey king to help him.  They beat   
 Ravana and went back to their kingdom 
 and ruled wisely.
