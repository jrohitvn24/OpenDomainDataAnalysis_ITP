		<title>14HORNCHURCH BUS GARAGE</title>
		<content>      The Bus Garage in Hornchurch Road
 was built in 1924 and re-built in     
 1954.   There are 52 buses that stay  
 the night and are washed and cleaned. 
 The offices and floor space take up   
 4500 square metres.   There are 133   
 drivers and 35 engineers.             
      The driver's day begins at 5am.  
 The first thing they do is to 'sign   
 on'.   They receive their ticket      
 machines and check their buses for    
 safety and cleanliness.   They have   
 15 minutes to do this.                
      The buses do over 31,600 miles a 
 week.   Double deckers carry 70 people
 while the single deckers, or          
 'scooters' as the drivers call them,  
 carry 63. One brand new bus costs     
 Â£82,000.   The tyres are hired from   
 Michelin who send their own expert to 
 keep the tyres in running order.
