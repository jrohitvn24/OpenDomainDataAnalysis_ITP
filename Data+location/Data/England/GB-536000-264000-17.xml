		<title>17LONGSTANTON ATTITUDES</title>
		<content>  19th-Century Longstanton was split   
 on religious grounds : Church or      
 chapel. We wondered what might divide 
 it now. Certainly there seem to be    
 opportunities for divisions.          
 Longstanton's shape, with its two     
 distinct "ends"; its six-fold growth  
 in 50 years; the presence through the 
 army of so many short-stay "outsiders"
 -all these might mean factions and    
 social strains. We did indeed hear of 
 'cliques'. St.Michael's residents, we 
 were told, felt separate from All     
 Saints'. There were few true village  
 people, many newcomers . Young wives  
 joined the Wives' Club, not the       
 Women's Institute. And many army      
 families tended not to give their     
 time to village matters ...... We     
 heard all these things, and we also   
 heard they did not exist. Perhaps     
 people see only what they want to see?</content>
