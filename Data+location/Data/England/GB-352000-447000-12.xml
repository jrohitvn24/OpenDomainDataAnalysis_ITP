		<content>By the nature of the area,life styles  
are of necessity somewhat self         
contained.Social opportunities are     
extremely restricted and,due to the    
scattered nature of the community,are  
dependent upon the possession of       
personal transport.When asked "when you
Â£go out'what form does the evening     
take?" Responses varied from having a  
meal out,visiting relatives and friends
womens institute activites,to dances in
village halls in nearby areas.         
There is no village hall in the area.  
The only public house,the Moorcock Inn,
is a social venue largely serving the  
needs of car owning people from outside
the area.At this inn meals are served  
and there is often live music. Home    
activities included gardening,reading, 
embroidery and renovating old cars.One 
of the elder resident said there ought 
to be "something for young ones."      </content>
