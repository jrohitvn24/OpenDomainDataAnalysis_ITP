		<title>09School Sports Day</title>
		<content> Annually in July,Sugar Hill School    
 holds its Sports Day.July 15th.1985   
 was special because it was the first  
 of the amalgamated school.At 11.00a.m.
 the preparations began,seating plans, 
 track adjustment,equipment,tug-of-war 
 heats, fete stalls and so on.         
 The weather which had threatened rain,
 held perfectly for the 1.00 p.m.      
 start.Although competition between the
 teams is fierce,fun is the important  
 factor.Jumpers,hoppers,skippers and   
 pupils in fancy dress competed in     
 imaginiative novelty races as well    
 as the pure sprints.Eventually the red
 team won for the second year running  
 and received the cup fron a retiring  
 teacher.Pupils teachers and parents   
 rounded off an enjoyable afternoon at 
 the fete,organised by parents and     
 raising Â£400 for the School Fund.
