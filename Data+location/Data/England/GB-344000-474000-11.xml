 The village has a Church of England   
 primary school and a Special School   
 for severely handicapped children of  
 school age run by Lancashire Education
 Authority.                            
 There are about one hundred children  
 aged between five and eleven at the   
 primary school with three full-time   
 and two part-time teachers. After     
 primary school children travel to     
 secondary schools in Carnforth and    
 Lancaster.                            
 Bleasdale House, the special school,  
 is a residential establishment with   
 about twenty residents and slightly   
 more attending on a daily basis.
