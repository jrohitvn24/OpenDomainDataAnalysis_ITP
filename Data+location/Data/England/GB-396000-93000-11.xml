		<title>11Lychett Minster Church</title>
		<content> This Parish Church looks old from the 
 outside and we were surprised to see  
 how modern it was inside. We met the  
 Reverend E. Cardale who told us about 
 the church.The church caters for eight
 thousand people but the parish of     
 Lychett Minster also covers the Upton 
 area. Upton has got its own church but
 it is not used as much as Lychett     
 Minster church. The tower is the      
 oldest remaining part of the original 
 church. The tower and font are both   
 about six hundred years old. In 1833  
 the church was rebuilt at the         
 front. The Lees family used to own the
 big manor house which is now the main 
 secondary school for the Lychett      
 Minster, Upton and Lychett Matravers  
 area. The Lees family had the stained 
 glass windows for the church made for 
 members of their family who had died.
