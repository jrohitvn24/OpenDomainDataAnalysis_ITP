		<title>05STOCKTON-DARLINGTON RAILWAY</title>
		<content>    In 1815, a local industrialist     
 wanted to find a new and cheaper way  
 of moving coal from the Durham        
 coalfield to the ports on the River   
 Tees.The{Stockton-Darlington railway  
 was built with the help of George     
 Stephenson, and became the first      
 passenger railway in the world.       
    The present double track line still
 follows the original route through    
 this area, with a{new station}built   
 especially for the airport.The line   
 links Darlington with Western parts of
 Cleveland carrying both passengers and
 industrial goods.                     
   There is a regular{passenger service
 with trains at \ hourly intervals     
 throughout the day, but not all of    
 them stop at the airport. Most of the 
 passengers are passing through as few 
 of the locals use the service at all.
