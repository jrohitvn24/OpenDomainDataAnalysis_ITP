		<title>08RECREATION - DERWENT VALLEY</title>
		<content>    The Derwent Walk Country Park is of
 major significance as a leisure       
 resource, though at present under     
 developed and under used. It replaces 
 the route of the original railway line
 both passenger and freight, from      
 Consett to Newcastle. In full swing,  
 the railway carried coal to the Tyne  
 and even then the valley was a popular
 beauty spot. The walk is 'single line'
 in width and almost all viaducts,     
 bridges and cuttings have been        
 retained and maintained with the      
 exception of 2 bridges over the B6310 
 Burnopfield to Hamsterley Mill and the
 Longclose Bank, Hamsterley Mill to    
 Medomsley, roads, which have now been 
 demolished. Though the surface and    
 verges of the Walk are adequately     
 maintained, little attempt has been   
 made to introduce new flora by the way
 of improvement.                       </content>
