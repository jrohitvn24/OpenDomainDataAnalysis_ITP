		<title>13Longridge Fell - Flora</title>
		<content> The fell is of millstone grit, with   
 limestone outcropping in the valley on
 the north side, around Arbour Farm.   
                                       
 "Arbour Quarry" now disused is a      
 designated nature reserve, noted for  
 its limestone flora, contrasting with 
 that of the acid soils of the fell    
 above, with its typically meagre      
 gritstone flora, which includes a     
 number of calcifuges; gorse, foxglove,
 and heath bedstraw.  There are also   
 herebell, bilberry, bramble,          
 cranberry, heath, cotton grass and    
 ling.                                 
                                       
 Recent attempts to improve the land   
 around Cardwell House have had little 
 success.   Other roadside plants      
 include Willowherb, bindweed,         
 sneezewort, yarrow, hawkbits, campion 
 and ragged robbin.                    </content>
