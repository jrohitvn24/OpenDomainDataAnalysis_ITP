		<content>    Approximately half the properties  
 in this area are owned by the Duke of 
 Westminster-the Grosvenor Estates.    
 These were purchased following the    
 death of Lady Sefton, the last of the 
 Molyneux family, in 1980. The land was
 bought primarily as a shooting estate 
 and in the past much of the farmland  
 was kept rougher and less well drained
 than that of owner occupiers, to give 
 cover for birds. Rents were kept low  
 by the Seftons who regarded the area  
 as one to be conserved. This attitude 
 is maintained by the Estates although 
 drainage, fencing and land improvement
 has increased with more emphasis on   
 commercial management. Farms here have
 often been tenanted by the same family
 for many generations. There is a      
 feeling among the tenants of belonging
 to a family and smaller cottages are  
 often let to retired estate workers.  </content>
