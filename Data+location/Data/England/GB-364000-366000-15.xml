		<title>15     A Modern School</title>
		<content>    In our school today there are many 
 differences from the work they did in 
 the past. For example in the past they
 had different schools for boys' and   
 girls'.Today we have mixed schools so 
 we can learn to get on with others,as 
 now women are classed as highly as    
 men.                                  
    Schools now have tables and we are 
 allowed to talk as it makes an        
 atmosphere that's easier to work in.  
 In the past children sat at desks in  
 rows and weren't allowed to speak.    
    Also today we use books and        
 equipment which makes work more       
 fun,whereas in the past the teacher   
 used to write on a blackboard and the 
 children would copy the work into     
 their books. Today we also work       
 outside from first hand experience.
