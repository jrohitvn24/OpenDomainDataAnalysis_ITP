		<title>05ECOLOGY - OUR SCHOOL FIELD</title>
		<content> On Monday June 24th we went for a walk
 in our school field. We saw the herb  
 garden; we saw mint, chives, thyme and
 sage. We saw some toadstools growing  
 in the field and some buttercups and  
 daisies. In the vegetable patch,      
 carrots, runner beans, radish and     
 tomatoes were growing. We went to a   
 tree and put some white paper under it
 and shook the tree and some leaves    
 fell down. We looked up and saw a tiny
 spider spinning a web. On Friday we   
 found a toad on the rockery. Today we 
 looked for the toad but could not find
 him, he had gone away. We saw poppies 
 and buttercups growing in the rockery.
 In the next field we saw a brown pony 
 and a baby foal. The foal neighed     
 because he was frightened of us. In   
 another field we could see some sheep.
