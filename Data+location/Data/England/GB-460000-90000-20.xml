		<title>20MY SATURDAY AND SUNDAY</title>
		<content>   On{Saturday}I sometimes like to get 
 up later than on school days. Usually 
 it is about{8.00am}.Sometimes I have a
 cooked{breakfast}as it is the         
 weekend.I always watch{television}on  
 Saturdays. Some of my friends have    
 piano lessons, gym, ballet or go      
 shopping. Usually I have a snack for  
 lunch. In the afternoon I like to play
 with my friends. There are good       
 television programmes on a Saturday   
 evening so I enjoy watching them.     
   On {Sundays}my parents like to lie  
 in, so we often get up a bit later    
 than usual. One or two of my friends  
 have to get up early to go{swimming.}I
 go to {Sunday School}at 11.00.We often
 have a roast dinner on Sundays. Me and
 my friends sometimes have an outing   
 on a {Sunday afternoon,}or visit      
 relations.In the evening I have a bath
 so I am ready for school the next day.</content>
