		<title>14THE GRAND UNION CANAL</title>
		<content>  The canal built in the 1700's which  
 fell into decline with the coming of  
 the railways, is a major feature of   
 the area. The canal today remains open
 for recreational use. The banks,      
 towpaths and bridges are in good      
 repair. A feature of the canal is that
 it cuts the village of Catherine de   
 Barnes in two with a road bridge      
 connecting both. In one of the        
 cottages by the canal is the remains  
 of the original Boat Inn, a pub and   
 hostel used by the bargees. It was    
 destroyed by fire in 1923 and the     
 present Boat Inn was built on the     
 Hampton Lane in 1925. One of the      
 residents for 70 years remembers      
 playing a game called 'pigeon toss'   
 while he waited for the old pub to    
 open.
