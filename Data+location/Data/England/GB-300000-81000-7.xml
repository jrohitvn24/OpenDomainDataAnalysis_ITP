		<content> Nothing but bustle in shops and       
 markets.                              
  eople pushing their way through the  
 crowds to get to the counter they     
 want,the queues get longer and longer 
 and the shoppers get more and more    
 angry.                                
 The music coming through the speakers 
 in the supermarkets is just loud      
 enough to hear but nobody takes any   
 notice,they just worry about getting  
 their shopping finished.              
 In markets  crowds are                
 everywhere,there are so many you      
 wouldn't think there were any         
 stalls.The shoppers push their way    
 round the market making their own way 
 to different stalls.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
