		<content>  There are about 22 farms in our area.
{Mr.Cocks'}farm is on the Blackmore    
 Vale at the Eastern edge of our block.
 We interviewed him to find the pattern
 of life on a{dairy}farm in 1985.      
  Mr. Cocks' family bought Brain's Farm
 in 1959. They then had 20 cows and 18 
 heifers on 100 acres of land. Today   
 they have 200 acres supporting 100    
 Friesian cows, 60 replacement heifers 
 and some bull beef as a sideline.     
  Their bull calves go to{F.M.C.}at    
{Salisbury}for slaughter and are then  
 supplied to Tescos. The cows go to    
 abbatoirs at{Martock}and are exported 
 to{France.}Their surplus calves go to 
{Sturminster Newton Market}and are sold
 for export to Holland and Belgium.    
  He has a herringbone{milking parlour 
 and milks the cows at 6.30 a.m. and at
 4.30 p.m. The process is semi-        
 automatic. cont                       </content>
