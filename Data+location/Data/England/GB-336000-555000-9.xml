		<title>09A CARLISLE SUBURB &lt;2></title>
		<content> Belle Vue is about two miles from the 
 city centre,so if you want to go into 
 town you have to walk,get a lift or   
 catch a bus.They run every fifteen    
 minutes,but the fares are expensive.  
 One other disadvantage is that there  
 is not much for older children to do  
 except go to one of the parks.        
 We live in the suburb of Belle Vue.   
 The nearest shop is McQuillin's on    
 Eskdale Avenue.My mum just gets bits  
 and bobs like milk.When my mum        
 wants bread she goes to Chambers      
 on Hutton Way.The main of our         
 weekly shopping is done in the town,  
 but my mum goes to Asda in Lancaster  
 occasionally.One disadvantage is      
 getting into the town;there are not   
 many buses because more people have   
 cars.Some advantages are that it is   
 cleaner,there is more space and it is 
 quieter.                              </content>
