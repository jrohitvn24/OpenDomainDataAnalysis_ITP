		<title>05THE NEW TRADING EST-MILLSHAW</title>
		<content> About five years ago,a new industrial 
 estate was built on existing farmland 
 at Millshaw,south of Cottingley.This  
 site is on the edge of Leeds and gives
 easy access to the M62.               
 Several firms established themselves, 
 employing small work forces,on average
 twenty.There is a variety of products 
 including window blinds,clothes lining
 ,fruit machines,oil filters and       
 confectionary.Apart from a Swedish    
 Company, they are all British,dist-   
 ributing products.                    
 Our survey showed that half the comp- 
 anies have an export trade.All but one
 has an increased work force,and for   
 the majority,trade is very good at the
 present time.Several have new ideas   
 for the future,including opening fact-
 ories abroad.
