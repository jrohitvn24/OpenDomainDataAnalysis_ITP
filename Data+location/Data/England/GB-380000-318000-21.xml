<title>21Gnosall Fire Station</title>
<content>

Gnosall Fire Station is a Retained Fire Station serving Gnosall and outlying villages.&lt;br />&lt;br />Fire fighters must live with a 5 minute response time of the station and are then given 5 minutes to change into under-rigg and fire kit and turn out to incident. The appliance is usually on route to incident within 8 minutes.&lt;br />&lt;br />Fire fighters carry an alerter which flashes, beeps and vibrates to alert them to respond to station. A print-out from Control gives them their incident, instructions and map reference.&lt;br />&lt;br />There must be a minimum of 4 fire fighters on duty to "ride the pump", 2 BA (breathing apparatus) in the back, an OIC (Officer in charge) and the driver who usually becomes "pump-man".&lt;br />&lt;br />Drill (training) night is once a week.&lt;br />&lt;br />Fire fighters are commonly called out to chimney fires, road traffic collisions and farm/farm equipment/barn fires as well as property fires and animal rescues.&lt;br />&lt;br />Gnosall Fire Station was built in 1967 and is currently undergoing refurbishment due for completion July 2011   &lt;br />
