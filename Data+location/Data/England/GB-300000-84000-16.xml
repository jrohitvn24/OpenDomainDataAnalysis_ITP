		<title>16ST.PETER'S SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   The{St. Peter's Estate}was first    
{owned by the late Admiral Peter}who   
 also owned much of the land around the
 school.This area{includes five farms  
 and St. Peter's School.When the       
 Admiral died he{left}it to{a lady     
{called Mrs.Ball}who now lives in      
 Bedfordshire.The land is therefore    
{looked after by six trustees}who      
 employ{Michael Hughes}of Exeter to    
 ensure that the buildings that        
 Mrs.Ball owns are well kept.Mrs Ball  
{leases 11 acres}to St. Peter's school.
 The{lease expires in 2015.            
   In recent months{four new classrooms
{have been added and the school has    
{been painted.}All these changes have  
 been{done by Brook Brothers.}Soon a   
 temporary changing room will be       
 erected and in years to come a        
 permanent changing room will be added 
 to the sports hall.                   </content>
