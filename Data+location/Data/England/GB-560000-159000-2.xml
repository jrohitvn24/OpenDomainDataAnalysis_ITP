 shopping survey.More than three       
 quarters of the people asked were old 
 aged pensioners.Five eights of the    
 survey asked shopped in Wrotham either
 daily or weekly.The rest said they    
 hardly ever shopped in Wrotham.       
   Although local people use the shops 
 frequently 25% do there main shopping 
 at Borough Green.Most of these said   
 that a bus ride to Gravesend would be 
 too costly.Most of the locals walk to 
 the shops themselves they include a   
 butchers,a post office, a grocery     
 shop, a hair and beauty shop, a bank  
 and a newsagents.Many local people    
 said they would like to see a chemist 
 shop open in the village.
