		<content> Mr.Mason cannot say exactly how many  
 newspapers etc.he sells,but estimates 
 that the amount of money spent on     
 newspapers and magszines in his shop  
 is Â£260 per week.The Beano is the most
 popular comic, the most popular       
 women's magazine is womens own.       
  the men's most popular magazine is   
 the golf magazine.                    
  Mr.Mason buys 80% of all his other   
 supplies such as groceries, wines and 
 spirits himself.                      
 20% of his supplies come from         
 wholesalers.                          
 The vegetable wholesaler dlivers      
 daily; the pie man dlivers twice a    
 week. The ice cream man dlivers once a
 fornight, so Corona soft drink        
 sopplier. Mr. does not sell milk      
 because milk does not keep fresh.     
 Two milk firims, Unigate and the Co-op
 deliver to the village .              </content>
