		<title>12Ecology of the Gunton area</title>
		<content>The younger generation of farmers      
particularly appear to be intensely    
interested in conservation of the      
countryside, to the extent that trees  
and hedgerows recently removed to      
provide more productive land,are now   
being replaced.There is a growing      
awareness of the need to preserve life 
in the local ponds,woods and other     
natural habitats.Wild animals,birds and
flowers abound in the Gunton Park and  
its surrounding woodland, a beautiful  
area, unspoilt by noise or pollution.  
However,both rabbits and pigeons are a 
cause for concern to the local farmers,
in an area where because of its very   
nature,control is difficult.Footpaths  
crossing arable land are indistinct.But
for those living in gunton park there  
are numerous walks and bridle paths.The
roads through the park are privately   
owned and closed to the public.        </content>
