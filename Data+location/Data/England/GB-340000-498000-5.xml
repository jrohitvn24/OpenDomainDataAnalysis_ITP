		<title>05Ecology - Lake shore.</title>
		<content> The whole shoreline of Windermere is  
 under great pressure where there is   
 public access. Most of the 1.5km. of  
 it which does lie in the survey area, 
 near Millerground,is owned by the     
 National Trust. They have provided a  
 car park, toilets, picnic area and    
 jetties. Two large wooden huts are    
 leased to Cumbria Education Committee 
 for use as a water activities base.   
 (see "Recreation")                    
 Pollution of the lake and the shore   
 line used to be a major problem,      
 largely as a result of effluent being 
 discharged from boats, but this has   
 now been banned and the consequent    
 improvement has benefited all lake    
 users. Noise is perhaps now the main  
 form of environmental pollution,      
 especially from low flying jet        
 aircraft and also from speed boats.   
 Ashore, litter is always a problem.   </content>
