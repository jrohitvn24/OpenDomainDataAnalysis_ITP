		<title>02Pimperne Village Survey</title>
		<content> We held a survey in the village.We    
 sent out 200 forms and had nearly     
 three quarters returned.              
 From the forms we had back we saw that
 80% of people who now live in Pimperne
 have lived here less than 20 years.   
 Almost everyone likes living here,they
 said it is quiet,a good convenient    
 position,healthy,friendly.Two people  
 said it was too quiet,two more said   
 they were lonely.Most have cars and   
 about a third go to village clubs or  
 associations.                         
 About 14% go to church regularly,41%  
 said they go occasionally.
