		<title>02CASTLE BYTHAM'S NEW BRIDGE</title>
		<content> The small river that flows through    
 Castle Bytham needed some work doing  
 to it.Due to land drainage near the A1
 trunk road flooding in the village    
 became an increasing problem.Also the 
 old bridge which crossed it at        
 St.Martin's was very dilapidated.     
 Eventually heavy farm traffic cracked 
 it.The name of the old bridge was     
 Irishman's Bridge - a very rustic     
 affair constructed from oil cans and  
 concrete.                             
    In Nov. 1984 the Anglian Water     
 Board began work on widening the river
 and constructing a wider and sturdier 
 bridge.After six months the work      
 was completed,much to the relief of   
 the residents of St.Martin's and      
 nearby cottages.
