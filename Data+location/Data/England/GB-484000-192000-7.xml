		<title>07HIGH WYCOMBE FIRE STATION</title>
		<content>{High Wycombe Fire Station}has around  
 60 men.It mainly serves High Wycombe, 
 Little Marlow, Amersham, Loudwater and
 Stokenchurch.                         
                                       
 The system works efficiently. When{a  
{fire occurs,}someone{dials '999'.}The 
{operator}puts him or her through to   
 the{fire station.}The person tells the
 fire officer{where the the fire is.}A 
 fire officer will tell the other men  
{where to go and how many engines are  
{needed.}If the firemen do not know the
 location they will pick out a card    
 with the name off a road from A to Z. 
 When the engines are needed some      
{lights on the wall flash.}Each light  
 has the initial of an engine on it, so
 the{firemen will know which engine    
 will{rush out}of the the station and  
 go and{fight the fire.
