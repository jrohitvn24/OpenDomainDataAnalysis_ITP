		<title>08Religion Shenley &amp; Whaddon</title>
		<content> Whaddon has 2 places of worship: the  
 fine 12th C parish church dedicated to
 St Mary &amp; a Congregational church     
 built in 1907. Whaddon has no resident
 clergyman but is served from nearby   
 Newton Longville. Shenley's Norman    
 parish church, is also dedicated to St
 Mary &amp; shares its rector with the next
 village, Loughton. Both Shenley &amp;     
 Loughton form the core of a large     
 residential development in Milton     
 Keynes.The in-coming population brings
 new life to the church &amp; necessitates 
 new forms of ministry. Congregations  
 gather in community buildings on the  
 new estates, &amp; plan new churches for  
 the future. Some Shenley villagers    
 belong to Loughton Baptist church a   
 very active church serving a wider    
 area than 2 villages. Roman catholics 
 travel to Bletchley.
