		<title>12MINSTERLEY CHURCH</title>
		<content>      Minsterley Church was built in   
{1690}for the{Thynne family}who owned  
 Minsterley Hall.The{stone}was from    
 Caus Castle, but mostly it was built  
 with{bricks}which they bought.        
      It was built to save the Thynne  
 family from going to Westbury every   
 Sunday.They even have their own{path  
{from the Hall to the Church,&amp;}their   
 own gate in the churchyard wall. It   
 was finished in 1692. The head of the 
 Thynne family is now The{Marquis of   
{Bath.                                 
      When my class visited the Church,
 I saw the sad &amp; faded{maidens'        
{garlands}&amp; a frightening{carving}by   
 the West door of{cherubs &amp; skulls &amp;   
{crossbones.}The{screen}has carvings of
{sea serpents}on it.                   
      It is calm &amp; peaceful in the     
{churchyard}where yew trees grow among 
 the{graves.                           </content>
