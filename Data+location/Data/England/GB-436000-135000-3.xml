		<title>03Fishing on the River Test</title>
		<content>  The River Test is the{finest trout   
{stream}in Europe,it is also one of the
 three finest trout rivers in the      
 world,so fishermen visit it from many 
 parts of the United Kingdom.Four      
 people are employed to look after the 
 river and there are three students who
 will look after other rivers when they
 graduate.                             
  There are three thousand fish reared 
 every year.They are also sold to other
 rivers to stock them.The average fish 
 caught weighs approximately two       
 pounds.They strip the females of their
 eggs and rear them themselves.Leckford
 has a stretch of three miles for      
 fishing and is part of the Middle     
 Test.
