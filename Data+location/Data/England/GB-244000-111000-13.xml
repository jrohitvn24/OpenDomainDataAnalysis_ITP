		<title>13ROWDEN FARM SHEBBEAR.</title>
		<content> Three adults and one child live here. 
 There is approx. 150 acres of which 15
 are rented. 50 acres are arable,      
 mainly barley. The rest is grassland, 
 mainly permanent pasture. The main    
 enterprise is sheep with a flock of   
 4oo ewes of Suffolk or Texel crosses. 
 The ewes lamb indoors between January 
 and March. Lambs are sold to the local
 abbatoir at Torrington.  There are 20 
 head of beef cattle and 2 Hereford    
 bulls that are hired to local dairy   
 farmers.  No permanent staff are      
 employed but temporary help is        
 obtained for lambing and harvesting.  
 Contractors are used for ploughing,   
 silage and combining. Redundant farm  
 buildings have been converted into a  
 granny flat.
