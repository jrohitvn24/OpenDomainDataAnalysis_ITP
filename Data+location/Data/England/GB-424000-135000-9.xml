		<content> The old characters of the village who 
 could be persuaded to sup a pint of   
 ale, and recount tales ofthe good old 
 days? when milk was delivered in a    
 churn carried on a milk               
 float,cigarettes were 2d for 10, bread
 2d a loaf baked in the local bakery,  
 and a farthing would buy a gobstopper,
 licorice lace,or a sugar mouse are    
 fast disappearing. Farm workers were  
 paid for a holiday on Good Friday     
 providing they attended church and    
 then planted their gardens.Shallots   
 should always be planted on this day  
 t'is said.Nowadays farm workers get   
 paid annual leave.                    
 It is important that these tales are  
 collected and printed for future      
 generations to read
