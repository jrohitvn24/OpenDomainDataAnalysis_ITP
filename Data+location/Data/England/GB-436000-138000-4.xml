 1964-1967.IT IS USED FOR              
 1.TROPOSPHERIC RADIO PROPOGATION (HOW 
 WELL RADIO WAVES TRAVEL THROUGH THE   
 WEATHER)                              
 2.MONITORING SCIENTIFIC SATELLITES.   
    THE DISH IS 25M. IN DIAMETER AND   
 WEIGHS 420 TONNES.2300 TONNES OF      
 CONCRETE WERE USED IN THE BUILDING OF 
 THE TOWER. THE MOVEMENT IS CONTROLLED 
 BY G.E.C. COMPUTERS.THE DISH RESTS ON 
 STEEL BALL BEARINGS AND CAN BE MOVED
