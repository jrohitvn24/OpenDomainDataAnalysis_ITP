		<title>20Richard Wakefield Charities</title>
		<content>Tutbury charities began in 1733 with   
money left in Richard WakefieldÂ£s will.
The charities still do a lot of the    
work they did 250 years ago,even now,  
but theyÂ£ve also added things to their 
list.Every person in the village 70    
years old or more receives two pounds  
and a card on their birthday and the   
same at Christmas.The Charities        
sometimes loan money to students going 
to university or anyone else in need.  
Decisions are made in the original     
house that was built [nick-named the   
soup house  for soup used to be given  
to people there for half a pint].      
The amount of money the charities have 
is not known but from all the land they
own,they receive an income of between  
two and three thousands pounds a year.
