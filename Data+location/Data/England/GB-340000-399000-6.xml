  The scheme lasts for twelve months,  
 and is broken down into seven separate
 areas:-clerical, sewing, painting and 
 decorating, joinery, carpentry,       
 metalwork and catering.               
 The day lasts from 8:30a.m until      
 4:30p.m, with a 15 minute break during
 the morning, and 45 minutes for lunch.
 On Friday the trainees finish at

 one day per week for one week during  
 the year the take part in an outdoor  
 pursuit course which includes         
 canoeing, swimming and many other

 succesful, and in 1985, 80% of the    
 trainees were succesful in finding    
 full time jobs.
