		<content> This is an area of wild open moorland 
 with only one habitation, Windleden   
 Farm within it. Ruins of coaching inns
 can still be seen at Saltersbrook and 
 Fiddlers Green. South of the river    
 Etherow the land is peat, highly      
 eroded in places with ling and        
 bilberry dominant, giving way to mat  
 grass on the lower slopes and cotton  
 grass on the wetter, flatter areas.   
 The land presents very poor grazing,  
 but sheep are to be seen in summer    
 even on the highest land within the   
 block. The area is dotted with        
 shooting butts, red grouse being the  
 game. North of the river the land is  
 similar but with abandoned fields in  
 the valleys. The whole of the area    
 lies withn the Peak District National 
 Park but at present only half is open 
 to the public.                        
                                       </content>
