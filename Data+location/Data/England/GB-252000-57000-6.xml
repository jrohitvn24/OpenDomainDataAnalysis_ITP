		<content>   In this part of Plympton we found   
 that over sixty per cent of households
 had two or more persons in employment.
 Just over thirty per cent have one    
 person working and only five per cent 
 of households had no workers.Most of  
 these were retired.                   
   The most frequent job was that of an
 engineer.We found that the Royal Navy 
 and British Telecom were the second   
 most frequent employers.After these   
 came the building trade and the police
 and fire services.Devonport dockyard  
 workers were the next most frequent   
 although many of the engineers were   
 based at Devonport.Other occupations  
 were teaching,civil service and the   
 G.P.O.                                
   Only twenty five per cent of house  
 holders spouses were housewives.Of the
 remainder shop assistant,nurse and    
 office worker was the commonest job.  </content>
