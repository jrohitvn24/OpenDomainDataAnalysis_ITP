		<title>08INTERVIEW - RYTON RESIDENT</title>
		<content> Mr Tasylor was born in 1899 in Clara  
 Vale. He had one sister. At the age of
 14 he started work in Clara Vale mine 
 as an apprentice blacksmith with a    
 view to learning how to shoe horses.  
 He worked twelve hours a day, from 6  
 a.m. to 6 p.m. His wage was 6/- (30p) 
 a week.                               
 When he was older he started working  
 down the mine looking after the pit   
 ponies which at that time were very   
 important to Britain's mining         
 industry. In 1913 there were about    
 71,000 pit ponies working in coal     
 mines in Britain and Mr Taylor was in 
 charge of 700 in 16 different pits in 
 this area. At that time 1,000 tons of 
 coal came out of the mine a day and   
 there was an equal amount of water    
 pumped out. When Mt Taylor has time to
 go on holiday he went by bus to       
 Newbiggin or Brampton.                </content>
