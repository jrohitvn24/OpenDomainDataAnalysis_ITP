Weather is the most important factor in
farming.1985 has been one of the wet-  
test summers on record which has given 
plenty of grass for grazing and silage.
Owing to the lack of sunshine little   
good hay has been made,a lot rotting in
the fields.                            
                                       
It has been disastrous for cereal grow-
ing, causing laid crops and uneven late
ripening requiring artificial drying.  
Dairy cattle have milked quite well and
beef cattle have maintained good growth
                                       
It is now the middle of September and  
if the cold wet conditions continue    
grass growth will slow up and cattle   
will have to be housed and fed costly  
winter rations.1985 will not be a very 
profitable year.
