		<title>02NW Derby, Weekend Home Life</title>
		<content>  The time when most families are      
 together is at the weekend. Some      
 common activities are going shopping, 
 visiting relatives and a special      
 Sunday Lunch.                         
{Helen:}On Saturday I think "Oh good,  
 it's not school today." Then me, my   
 sister and my Dad go to the paper shop
 and get some sweets and my Dad pays   
 the papers. Then we take Mum to work. 
{Rebecca:}We have tea and then we go   
 out to a club.  My Mum and Dad go to  
 the chip shop on the way home. On     
 Sunday my sister wakes my Mum and Dad 
 up early and they are tired in the    
 afternoon.                            
{Alison:}Sunday dinner is roast        
 potatoes, carrots, peas &amp; stuffing.   
 After dinner we have a pudding like   
 apple crumble, apricot crumble, apple 
 pie with custard.                     
                                       </content>
