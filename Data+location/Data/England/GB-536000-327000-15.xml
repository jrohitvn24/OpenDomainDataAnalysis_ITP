		<title>15Conservation around the Hurn</title>
		<content> Most of the land around Holbeach Hurn 
 and in this block is under various    
 arable crops and horticulture.Many of 
 the smallholders use organic          
 fertilisers etc.as they are working on
 a small scale.Mr.Hardy who has a      
 nursery in the Hurn uses fungicide to 
 keep away disease in his crops,but he 
 uses no insecticide as that would kill
 his bees and the ladybirds that kill  
 his insects for him.Two large         
 farms,Worth's and Thompson's,use      
 mostly organic fertilisers etc. and   
 Thompsons first introduced animals as 
 natural fertilisers of the ground.Both
 farms have specially laid aside areas 
 of bushes,trees,hedges and ponds for  
 wildlife,and Mark Tinsley,although he 
 uses standard chemical farm           
 sprays,does not take up hedges.All 3  
 are doing their bit towards           
 conservation.                         </content>
