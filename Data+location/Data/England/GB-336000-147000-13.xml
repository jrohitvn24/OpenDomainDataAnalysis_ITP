		<title>13Drainage of Mark's Moors</title>
		<content> Like many villages of Somerset,the    
 principal occupation of the           
 inhabitants is farming and it grew up 
 as a market centre for its produce. As
 can be gathered by the name of the    
 main road-{The Causeway}used to be the
 only route through the area above     
 water and this is thought to be       
 another reason for the name of the    
 village- the fact that a "Mark was    
 left by the water".Willows were       
 planted to help drainage. The water   
 slowly subsided but even in the       
 1950 flooding was a real problem tothe
 farmers who often had to use boats to 
 reach Mark. The 50s saw the start of  
 a new{drainage system}which controls  
 the amount of water in the ditches.   
 The effect of the water was to produce
 a very acidic soil suitable only for  
 dairy farming. Despite the use of     
 fertilisers,crop yields are poor here.</content>
