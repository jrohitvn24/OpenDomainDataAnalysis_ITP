 Question _ What do you think of the   
 idea of building on{Walpole Park?     
 'I don't like the idea at all! I can  
 see that, to the Council, the land is 
 a valuable commodity, in terms of     
 building space but, more and more     
 Gosport people see its value in terms 
 of{recreational space}and freedom. The
 park is of historical value. It is    
 said that it was given to the people  
 of Gosport by Lady Walpole in the     
 17th. century so that they could have 
 a wide open space to enjoy in an      
 ever_growing town!                    
 Question _ Don't you think that the   
 'plans' would give more trade, jobs   
 and{leisure}opportunities?            
 'There are plenty of leisure          
 facilities in our area. An ice rink   
 has been suggested but could Gosport  
 support one?                          </content>
