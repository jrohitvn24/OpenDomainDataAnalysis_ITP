		<content>  The days of country people never     
 moving out of their own village seem  
 to be over.The poor local 'bus service
 was used by only 30% of the people    
 interviewed and the vast majority had 
 their own cars. Most people had       
 visited other parts of the country ,  
 and 66% had been abroad for a holiday.
  The countries that they had visited  
 were mainly European,although one     
 family had been to America several    
 times. Most of the younger people     
 asked, expected that they would have a
 holiday this year,but some of the     
 older ones said that they weren't     
 bothered about a holiday,or that they 
 could not afford one.                 
   Of the children in our class,many   
 were going away to stay with friends  
 or relations;several were going       
 camping and 25% were flying abroad to 
 their holiday destination.            </content>
