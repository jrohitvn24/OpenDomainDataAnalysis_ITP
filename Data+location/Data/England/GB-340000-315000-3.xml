		<title>03MONTFORD BRIDGE-VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content> Montford Bridge is quite a close-knit 
 community, with many locals taking    
 an active interest in the life of the 
 village.  One focus for this interest 
 is the village hall which is regularly
 used for a variety of functions.      
 The village has a youth club which    
 meets once a week.  The Womens'       
 Institute makes use of the hall for   
 their regular meetings and for        
 activities such as Keep Fit &amp; Weight  
 Watchers.  Dances for both older and  
 younger generations take place        
 regularly.  The annual New Year's Eve 
 Ballroom Dance is especially popular. 
                                       
 The hall was built in 1953 at a cost  
 of Â£3573 with a Â£10,000 extension     
 being added in 1984.  Most of this    
 money was raised by the local         
 community.
