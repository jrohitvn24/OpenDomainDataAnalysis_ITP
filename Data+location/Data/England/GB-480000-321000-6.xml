		<content> Hunting and shooting, both pheasant   
 and partridge, are traditional        
 pastimes in the area. Much used by the
 Belvoir Hunt during the hunting season
 from September to March, the area     
 contains a number of small woods which
 have been deliberately maintained as  
 fox coverts. The names of some woods  
 actually indicate why they were       
 originally planted, for example       
 'Waltham New Covert' south of the T.V.
 transmission mast.                    
 Other woodlands are utilised for the  
 breeding of game birds. These tend to 
 be on higher ground allowing the birds
 to be driven onto the guns which would
 be situated on lower ground outside   
 the wood.
