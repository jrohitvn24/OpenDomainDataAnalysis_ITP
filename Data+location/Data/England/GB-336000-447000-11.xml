		<content> Up to 4000 tons were produced in a    
 week.About 1/2 went to the Alkali     
 Works for the sodium carbonate process
 and the rest went from a jetty on the 
 Wyre (map ref 03480467) for export.The
 influx of Cheshire miners was known as
 the Northwich Invasion.When I.C.I. was
 formed in 1926 it took over the United
 Alkali Co. Mining stopped in about    
 1930 due to sudden flooding.Air       
 controlled forced brine wells were    
 pioneered at Preesall, this protects  
 against subsidence and gives increased
 yield.Nowadays 3 concentric tubes are 
 used.The outer (diameter 10.5")       
 carries air at 600psi,the middle(7")  
 of adjustable depth carries water at  
 180psi,and the brine enters the inner 
 tube coming out at 7psi.The cavities  
 are regularly checked by echo sounding
 so that the shape and size can be     
 controlled.                           </content>
