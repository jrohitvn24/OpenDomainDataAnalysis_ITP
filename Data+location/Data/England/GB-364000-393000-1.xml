		<title>01Summary of Culcheth D-block</title>
		<content>    Although we are close to many large
 towns and cities, our D-block consists
 mostly of agricultural land, and the  
 village of Culcheth.  Our main claim  
 to fame is that the Headquarters of   
 the Atomic Energy Authority are       
 situated on the edge of the village.  
 Because of this, many of its residents
 are quite well-paid employees of the  
 Authority.                            
    We also have Risley Remand Centre  
 nearby, where many prisoners are held 
 awaiting trial.  It is a forbidding   
 looking place.                        
    There are excellent road           
 communication links, and with all the 
 local parks and countryside around it 
 is a very pleasant and convenient     
 place to live.
