		<title>01S.E. LEIGHTON BUZZARD</title>
		<content>  The area adjoining Leighton Buzzard  
 to the south and east has some housing
 and some industrial development       
 leading out to open countryside and   
 farm land. There are signs of earlier 
 occupation and industries: remains of 
 early settlements at the Grove Dig, a 
 narrow gauge railway earlier used to  
 transport sand from the pits to the   
 railway, but is now used for pleasure 
 trips, and a disused railway track    
 going from Leighton Buzzard to        
 Dunstable. The town has become one of 
 the fastest growing small settlements 
 in England with new housing built for 
 commuters: London is less than an hour
 by train. Billington is the only      
 village in the area, three miles from 
 Leighton Buzzard. It has very few     
 amenities. There is no village        
 policeman: a neighbourhood watch is   
 used instead.                         </content>
