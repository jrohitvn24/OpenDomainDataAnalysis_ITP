The old school was next to the church. 
Now it has been converted into a house.
Before 1963 when it became a maintained
school it had been a church school. The
children had to go to a service on     
Friday and were also expected to attend
the service on Sundays. On Monday the  
vicar would come in and test the       
children on his sermon. They had       
lessons on religion every day for half 
an hour. On Ascencion Day there was a  
special service for the school, after  
which they would go for a walk across  
the fields and around the school. The  
children collected halfpennies for a   
new coloured statue of Mary which      
stands in front of the altar, and the  
old wooden one now stands at the back  
of the church. Children in the choir   
wore blue cassocks and were strictly   
supervised by the schoolmistress.      </content>
