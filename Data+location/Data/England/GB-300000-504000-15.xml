		<title>15Social Concerns in Beckermet</title>
		<content>  Sellafield, the Atomic Energy Complex
caused many local problems. One of     
these was the volume of traffic which  
travelled through the village of       
Beckermet at the start and finish of   
each shift. The construction of a new  
road skirting the village has          
alleviated this problem considerably.  
  Another problem was the pollution of 
the local beaches in 1983 by           
radioactive effluent which had been    
leaking into the Irish Sea from the    
chemical reprocessing site. This meant 
that all the local beaches were closed 
to the public for that summer. They are
still being closely monitored.         
  The high incidence of childhood      
cancer cases in the nearby area is also
being attributed to Sellafield. This   
has yet to be established.
