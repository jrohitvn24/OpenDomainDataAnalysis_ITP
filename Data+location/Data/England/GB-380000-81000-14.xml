		<content> Apart from the Army Camp (see Armed   
 Forces) the dominant groups of        
 buildings in the landscape are        
 associated with agriculture. The older
 farm buildings are built of local     
 materials. Drove Dairy, one of the    
 modern buildings is a typical 1980's  
 design of steel frame with low-level  
 block and high-level slatted timber   
 cladding and a corrugated asbestos    
 roof. Other modern buildings can be   
 found at Burngate, Newlands and West  
 Down.                                 
 Winfrith Down, Sleight and Vines Down 
 buildings, Marley Wood Barn, Burngate 
 Farm and Belhuish Farm are examples of
 post-enclosure farmsteads. These are  
 now integrated into holdings but were 
 originally built with local materials,
 as individual units following the Act 
 of Enclosure of 1768.
