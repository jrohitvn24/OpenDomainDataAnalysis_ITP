		<content> It was 1066 when he first made his    
 plan,                                 
 He said,"I'll record every woman and  
 man,                                  
 Every cook, every crook, in one great 
 big book,                             
 People from everywhere will come to   
 look."                                
 And now it is famous all over the     
 nation,                               
 If only King William could see his    
 creation.                             
 And now with computers again we can do
 it,                                   
 It's very much quicker, there's not a 
 lot to it,                            
 So now{we're}recording every woman    
 and man.                              
 Every cook, every crook on a{computer
