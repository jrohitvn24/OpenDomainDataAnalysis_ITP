		<content>    Kettlewell is in Upper Wharfedale, 
 and is a Conservation Area within the 
 Yorkshire Dales National Park, 14     
 miles north of Skipton.  The River    
 Wharfe flows south through a glacial  
 valley with banks of meadow and       
 pasture land.  Upland rough grazing   
 and limestone scars reach to the      
 bleaker moor-tops.                    
    The lower areas are well clad with 
 trees.  Dry stone walls divide the    
 hillsides roughly into rectangles,    
 many of great length and height,      
 constructed after the Enclosure Acts. 
 Cam Beck flows though the village from
 Gt. Whernside, joined by Dowber Gill  
 Beck, to meet the Wharfe.  All can    
 rise rapidly to cause flash fooding.  
 Numerous shake-holes, pot-holes,      
 disused lead-mines, bell-pits and     
 caves riddle the area.  Evidence of   
 early settlements can be clearly seen.</content>
