		<content>Housing is from three periods of growth
 - pre-war,inter-war and post-war,with 
a mixture of private and council       
estates.The pre-war area consists of   
semi-detached and terraced housing.The 
houses in the large inter-war          
development are individually styled    
with large gardens characteristic of   
the 1930's.They are situated in        
pleasant residential roads.The         
post-war houses are mainly in-filling  
areas around the pre- and post-war     
housing.A new estate called St.Josephs 
was built in the early 1980's on the   
land where two large orphanages stood. 
A housing association built the        
Keniston Housing Estate seven years    
ago.The homes are flats,terraces or    
semi-detached houses,and they are      
rented.The Pratt's Bottom area has     
ribbon development along main roads,   
including weather boarded cottages.    </content>
