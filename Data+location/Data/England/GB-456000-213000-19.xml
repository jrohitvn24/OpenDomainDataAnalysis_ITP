		<title>19A SCHOOL DAY (1)</title>
		<content>I get my football kit as it is Thursday
and I walk along to school, it takes   
about 5 minutes. When I get to school I
see my best friend and team mate at    
football, Mark. I go and put my bag    
away and run out so I can play Tig.    
What you have to do for that is        
someone is " It" and when they catch   
someone they are it as well and so on. 
Then the bell rings and we go into     
school, the first thing we do is       
reading. I am reading a book called    
"Kick Off", it is about a 16 year old  
boy who is mad about football. After   
reading we have Assembly. Mr Chivers   
our Headmaster reads us a story then we
sing. My favourite hymn is called "When
the knight won his spurs in the stories
of old". After that we have a prayer.  
After assembly we do maths, I am doing 
percentages. Then it is playtime which 
lasts about 15 minutes.                </content>
