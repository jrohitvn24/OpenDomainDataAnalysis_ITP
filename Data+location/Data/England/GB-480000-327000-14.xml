		<title>14A DAY OF MY LIFE ALEX</title>
		<content> I get up at 8.00 and wake up everybody
 else in the house, then I go          
 downstairs and open the curtains and  
 switch on t.v and wait until mum comes
 downstairs and we have breakfast.     
 After that Oliver and I get dressed   
 and have a cup of tea then we go to   
 school.When we get to school the first
 thing I do  is spellings then         
 handwriting  after that we have       
 assembly, then we go outside.When we  
 come in we do maths, then we have     
 dinner at 12.00.                      
 When we come in we have reading.      
 And in between we do things like      
 sport,science,computer work,woodwork  
 and sometimes we go on trips for      
 instance Peakirk wildfowl centre.     
 Then we sometimes do singing.         
 At 3.30 we go home.                   
 When we get home I watch t.v or       
 sometimes a friend comes round to play</content>
