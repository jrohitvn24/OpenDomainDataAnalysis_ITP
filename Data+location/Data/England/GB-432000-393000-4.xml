		<content> A group of children from Coit school  
 went on the street to interview the   
 local people.Most people lived in     
 Ecclesfield,the ones living in        
 chapeltown and Grenoside have further 
 to go to Ecclesfield Town             
 centre.A large majority of Ecclesfield
 residents have lived in Ecclesfield a 
 few years .That probably is the reason
 why only 4 people lived in            
 Grenoside,and 5 in Chapeltown.Lots of 
 people have moved into the Chapeltown 
 area for more jobs and other family   
 reasons.The older residents use more  
 of the local transport than the       
 younger generation.Most people would  
 like more chemists street cleaners and
 many more jobs.The residents of       
 Ecclesfield use local recreational    
 facilities including                  
 Concord,Chapeltown,Colley,and         
 Ecclesfield parks.                    </content>
