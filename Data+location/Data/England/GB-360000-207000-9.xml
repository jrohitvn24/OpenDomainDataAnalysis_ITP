		<content> This is a club for the over 60s run   
 under the W.R.V.S. it was formed in   
 1971 and meets fortnightly.Meetings   
 may be just an informal chat over tea 
 and biscuits and other times a speaker
 is invited.This year members have had 
 day trips to Stafford -On-Avon and    
 Weston-Super-Mare, an afternoon with  
 tea and entertainment arranged by the 
 county W.R.V.S.,whilst some joined    
 with another club to spend a holiday  
 in Jersey.A harvest servise and sale  
 is held annually  when other clubs    
 are invited .Members enjoy a Christmas
 Lunch each year.Blankets and jerseys  
 have been knitted and crotcheted for  
 the Ethiopian Famine Appeal and soft  
 toys for the Christmas parcels for the
 privileged children made together with
 dolls renovated and dressed.It is     
 hoped this year to hold a small       
 exhibition of work done by members.   </content>
