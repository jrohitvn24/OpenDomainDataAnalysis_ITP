		<title>19WATER IN OUR 12 sq. km.</title>
		<content>                                       
   The water table in Charing is very  
close to the soil surface. There are   
two springs in our grid square. The    
streams that come from them feed the   
Great Stour river.                     
   There are ten ponds in our grid     
square. They are full of little pond   
creatures such as pond skaters, water  
boatmen and whirligig beetles. We found
a common horse leech in one of the     
ponds.                                 
   Charing is also the place where this
area's water supply comes from. The    
water board buildings are found on the 
Pluckley Road. There are bore-holes    
here. The ground is very sandy so as   
the water comes up from the ground it  
is filtered naturally. It is piped into
the the buildings where Chlorine is    
added. The water here already has      
Fluorine in it, so none is added.      </content>
