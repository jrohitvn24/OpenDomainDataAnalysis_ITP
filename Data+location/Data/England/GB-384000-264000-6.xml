		<title>06DOVERDALE CHURCH.</title>
		<content> The congregation varies from about 25 
 to 150 people. The church has two     
 wardens and its own choir of 7 or 8   
 people.The choir is for boys and      
 girls. Over{Â£300}has been spent on new
 robes for the choir.Doverdale church  
 has not had any vandalism mainly      
 because there is a farm down the road 
 which keeps an eye on it, but this is 
 surprising as it is an isolated area  
 and you would think people would take 
 advantage of this. People can only get
 married if they live in the parish.   
 There are about{7}weddings a year.By  
 law you can be buried in the church   
 land if you die in the parish.There   
 are about {5}funerals a year.The      
 church arranges trips for the people  
 of the church.The church has a service
 on Sundays at 9.45am and another at   
 11.30am.
