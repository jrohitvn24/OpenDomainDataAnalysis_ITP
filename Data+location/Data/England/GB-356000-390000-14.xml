		<title>14A DAY IN MY LIFE (cont.)</title>
		<content>   Our first piece of work is revision 
 either maths or english and should be 
 completed before the bell goes for    
 Assembly. The{Headmistress}takes this.
 We have a hymn, prayer and talk which 
 usually lasts about 20 minutes.       
   During the rest of the morning we   
 complete a piece of{English work}and  
 some{Maths.}When 12.00 noon arrives we
 go to the hall for our lunch and then 
 play out until 1.00 pm.               
   The afternoon lessons are usually   
 connected with{geography, history, bi-
{ology topics}or{library periods.}Once 
 a week we have a games period and in  
 the summer we{swim}in the school pool.
   At 3.30 p.m. school finishes and it 
 is time to walk home. I get changed   
 out of{school uniform}and either play 
 on my{bicycle}or watch{T.V.}until tea 
 time, and then I may play out or do   
{homework}until 9.30 when I go to bed. </content>
