		<content>     ON TUESDAY 4TH JUNE MR NIGHTINGALE
 FROM RADIO BRISTOL CAME TO CLASS 3 OF 
 MILVERTON SCHOOL. HE TALKED TO THEM   
 ABOUT THEIR FOOD PROJECT. CLASS 3'S   
 PROJECT WAS ABOUT WHICH SCHOOL COULD  
 MAKE THE BEST SCHOOL DINNERS. HE ASKED
 HOW THEY FOUND OUT WHICH WAS THE MOST 
 POPULAR MEAL (SAUSAGES, CRISPS, BEANS 
 AND JELLY) AND WHAT KIND OF CHART THEY
 USED. ON WEDNESDAY, 6TH JUNE CLASS 3  
 WERE ON RADIO BRISTOL.                
                                       
     ON THE 2ND OF JUNE 1985, THERE WAS
 A WALK FROM MILVERTON TO RADDINGTON.  
 IT WAS ARRANGED BY MILVERTON'S VICAR. 
 SOME PEOPLE WERE BEING SPONSORED TO   
 RAISE MONEY FOR MILVERTON CHURCH, SOME
 FOR RADDINGTON CHURCH AND SOME FOR    
 ETHIOPIA. IT WAS 9 MILES ACROSS THE   
 COUNTRY, BUT IT WAS MORE LIKE A RAMBLE
 THAN A WALK. WHEN WE GOT TO RADDINGTON
 CHURCH WE HAD A SERVICE, WITH A BAND. </content>
