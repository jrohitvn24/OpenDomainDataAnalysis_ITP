 There has been a monastery on the     
 clifftop at Tynemouth since 627, but  
 it did not become a centre of religion
 until the Benedictine monks rebuilt it
 in 1130 and it remained an important  
 centre until the dissolution of the   
 monasteries by King Henry VIII. The   
 nave continued to be used as a parish 
 church until 1688 but by this time    
 most of the other buildings were      
 falling into decay. Many of the       
 buildings now have only their         
 foundations remaining and the only    
 part of the church to be completely   
 preserved is the tine Percy Chapel    
 added in 1450.
