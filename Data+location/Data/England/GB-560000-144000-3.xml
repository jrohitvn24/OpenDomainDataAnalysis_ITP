		<title>03LIFE AND CONCERNS IN CAPEL</title>
		<content>  THIS AREA IS CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH  
 FIVE OAK GREEN WHERE MOST OF THE 2000 
 PEOPLE LIVE AND WITH WHOM THERE IS A  
 STRONG SENSE OF COMMUNITY. WHEN NEW   
 ESTATES WERE BUILT IN THE LATE SIXTIES
 THERE WAS INITIALLY A GULF BETWEEN    
 "OLD"AND"NEW"VILLAGERS WHICH HAS SINCE
 CLOSED AND ALL ENJOY THE IMPROVED     
 AMENITIES. A LONG STANDING PROBLEM HAS
 BEEN THE WIDE DISTRIBUTION OF THE 3   
 ANGLICAN CHURCHES. RECENTLY ST.LUKE'S 
 HAS JOINED IN COVENANT WITH THE U.R.C.
 TUDELEY,WITH ITS CHAGALL WINDOWS NOW A
 TOURIST MECCA, HAS MAINTAINED A WEEKLY
 TRADITIONAL 11A.M.SERVICE AND CAPEL   
 NOW HOLDS ONLY 2 SERVICES EACH YEAR.  
{SUBJECTS OF CONCERN}= LIMITED AND DEAR
 BUS SERVICES,TOO MANY CONTINENTAL     
 CONTAINER LORRIES THUNDERING ALONG THE
 B2017,INCREASED HOUSE BREAKING, LOCAL 
 GRAVEL EXTRACTION AND FARMING CHANGES 
 CAUSED BY E.E.C. MARKET CONTROLS.     </content>
