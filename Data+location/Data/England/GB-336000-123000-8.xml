		<title>08Curry Rivel Cub Pack</title>
		<content> In Curry Rivel we have a cub pack. Cub
 Scouts are a branch of the Scout      
 Movement, for boys between 8 and 11   
 years old. Our pack has 3 leaders who 
 are called Akela, Bagherer andd Baloo.
 There are 16 boys in our cub pack who 
 are divided into groups of 4. Each    
 group has a leader who is called a    
 sixer and the deputy is called a      
 seconder. The pack meets each Monday  
 evening, except during school         
 holidays, in the old school room      
 between 6.30p pm and 8.oo pm.         
 Activities at these meetings include  
 games such as 'Tag',drill, tidying our
 boxes and badge work. The tests that  
 we do are for our Arrows; Bronze,     
 Silver and Gold. At the start of each 
 meeting we say the Grand Howl. This   
 involves us chanting,                 
  "We will do our best."
