		<title>08LAMPLUGH HOUND TRAILS</title>
		<content> A hound trail is like a fox hunt      
 without a fox. The dogs which are     
 especially bred for the sport, are    
 always called hounds. The hounds have 
 to follow a trail through differnt    
 parts of the lake district. Two men   
 walk around with a sent in old knitted
 jumpers and old socks sewn together.  
 If the hounds worry any lambs while   
 they are running on the trail they all
 have to be put down.If the hounds get 
 lost on there trail, all until the    
 hound has been found. All the hounds  
 line up on the starting line, and are 
 set off together. They are fed on     
 meat, sterry, eggs, milk, vegetables  
 and vitamin tablets when they are not 
 running.
