		<title>20CHILDREN'S GAMES IN SWANAGE</title>
		<content>  {"Army"}is a game where two equal    
 teams have a base each. They fight    
 with make-believe weapons, and if one 
 gets shot, he has to pretend to be    
 dead for ten seconds. We play this at 
 home and at school.                   
   Computer games are very popular and 
 in recent years nearly every school in
 Britain bought a computer. Our        
 favourite computer game is{"Count Down
{to Doom".}In this game you are stuck  
 in a space-ship and none of the doors 
 will open. You have to decide where to
 go and what to do. You have to try to 
 escape and avoid the explosives.      
   A game we play a great deal at      
 school is{"Pom one-two-three".}It is  
 very much like hide and seek.         
   Generally the boys play{"Football"} 
 and the girls{"Skip".}
