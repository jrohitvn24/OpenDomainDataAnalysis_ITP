		<content> The competition between the two       
Clipston Churches has been resolved    
over the years, the two rectors now    
preach in each others' church.         
 A church has existed on the site of   
All Saints Church since the eleventh   
century. It was entirely rebuilt in the
thirteenth century, and the south aisle
was added at a later date.             
 In 1886-88 the whole church was       
restored. At this time the two         
galleries on the south side of the     
nave, one above the other, were        
removed.                               
 The church possesses two fonts, one by
the south door, the other by the north 
door. The one near the south door is   
used at present.                       
 A clock was placed in the tower to    
commemorate the Jubilee of Queen       
Victoria in 1887.
