		<title>05Kimbolton School (Present)</title>
		<content>    In 1950 the School acquired        
{Kimbolton Castle}and its surrounding  
 grounds. In 1975 it became an         
 independent school on the government's
 abolition of{Direct Grant status.}In  
 1976 it became a co-educational       
 school. The castle influences the     
 school's character, and vice-versa.The
 original medieval hall is now a       
 library; the family chapel is crammed 
 for school worship; the apartment once
 used by{Catherine of Aragon}is the    
 Headmaster's study. Vanbrugh's south  
 facade provides a unique setting for  
 cricket, and the C17 courtyard for    
 drama. Numerous new buildings have    
 been erected in the grounds and the   
 school roll has grown to 150 (8-11)   
 and 500 (11-18).The proportion of     
 boarders has declined but population  
 growth in the area has ensured ample  
 day applicants.                       </content>
