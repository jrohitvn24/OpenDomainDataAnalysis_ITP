		<content>In our class eighteen of the thirty    
children have a school dinner. I have a
packed lunch instead. Here is what I   
eat on a typical day. For breakfast I  
have Branflakes or porridge with milk  
or orange juice. At playtime we have a 
snack, crisps or an apple, sometimes   
some chocolate or a biscuit. Dinner or 
lunch is often a roll with cucumber, a 
Mars bar and two glasses of water. Tea 
tis the last real meal of the day      
between 5 and 6 o'clock. It might be   
fried bread and bacon or a casserole   
with a drink of orange or lemonade or  
milk. For supper I have an apple or    
cheese and a glass of milk.            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
