 Woke up at 7.45 got dressed and had   
 toast for breakfast, then got washed  
 for school I walked to school and     
 arrived about 8.45. at 9.00 I went

 play rounders again. At home I watched
 the video until my mum returned from

 wall until teatime. At 18.00 we went  
 to cricket match at Crayke.           
 I then went to Nannys and read for a  
 while, then my cousins arrive and I   
 play with them for a bit and then     
 biked to the pub for peanuts, then    
 went home and had supper and went to  
 bed.
