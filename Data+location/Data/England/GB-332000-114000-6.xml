		<title>06SHATTRICK HOUSE BROADWAY</title>
		<content> Shattrick house,situated in the       
 village of Broadway is known for its  
 fire place.It is the biggest Inglenook
 fire place in Great Britain.The fire  
 place is 13 feet long and the depth is
 15 feet.                              
    The house is about 400 or 500 years
 old,the fire place was built a little 
 later than the house.The fire place   
 has an oak beam which supports it and 
 there are big slabs of cobb stone     
 for the hearth.                       
    The fire place's chimney is very   
 big,it was possible to see the sky if 
 you stood under it,but it is now      
 filled in.Shattrick house is not open 
 to the public,but it is a very nice   
 place.
