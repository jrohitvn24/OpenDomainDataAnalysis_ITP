		<title>11A day of a one pound note.</title>
		<content>  Hello, I'm a pound note. I'm green   
 have a picture of Queen Elizabeth II  
 on one side and Sir Isaac Newton on   
 the other. I am underneath the spring 
 which stops the pound notes from      
 moving around the till. The new coins 
 have a seperate compartment. We pound 
 notes find it above our dignity to mix
 with these new unpopular midgets.I was
 first placed here by a lady who came  
 to this shop,{"Mace"}in{Hawks Road}to 
 buy a pound of apples for 32p. While I
 was in her hand, I took a look at the 
 shop. It had a shelf for bread and    
 cakes by the window, a few shelves    
 with household appliances, and shelves
 for food and drink. I could see       
{Mcvities chocolate biscuits}for 45p,  
{Bisto's gravy}for 30p and{Domestos    
{bleach}for 64p. A refridgerator stores
 cold food, a freezer stores frozen    
 foods.                                </content>
