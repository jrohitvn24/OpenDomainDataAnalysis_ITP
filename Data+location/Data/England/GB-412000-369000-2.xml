		<title>02Taddington's Parish Church</title>
		<content> The church was built of limestone     
 about 1350.It serves   the parishes of
 Taddington,Priestcliffe,Blackwell and 
 Brushfield.It has a stone wall lectern
 stone sedilia seats and an old stone  
 altar top set in the floor under the  
 present wooden altar.One of the two   
 fonts was recovered from the former   
 Star Inn  where it had been used for  
 washing mugs!An older one is in the   
 porch.The churchyard is big and part  
 is cut for hay.It has a slender shaft 
 which may be 1200 years old.You can   
 see where tools have been sharpened on
 one side of it.Some of the older      
 gravestones were made by a family of  
 stonemasons who lived in what is now  
 the old post office. The school pupils
 planted a beech sapling in 1984 to    
 eventually replace a 200 year old     
 beech tree near the tower.
