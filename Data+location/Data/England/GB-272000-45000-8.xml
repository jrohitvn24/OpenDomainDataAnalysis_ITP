		<content> Brunel first thought of a railway to  
 Kingsbridge in 1836.The line ran      
 through Loddiswell,opened in 1893 and 
 closed in 1963.All that is left of the
 trainline are some cuttings,an old    
 tunne and a few stations(now houses). 
 A lot of people remebered the trains  
 and thought it was bad when they      
 stopped. Some said they would like it 
 to be re-used like the one at Dart    
 Valley but it probably won't be.      
 There used to be buses running around 
 a lot of the roads in this area.Today 
 the buses only go on the main roads to
 Plymouth and Totnes (3 per week).     
 Most people use cars to get around in 
 and nearly all the people wa asked    
 said they couldn't live in this area  
 without one.There is a Mini bus that  
 goes around the villages for those who
 can't use a car like the elderly.It is
 called the{Coleridge Bus.}            </content>
