		<title>07A TYPICAL SATURDAY</title>
		<content> On Saturday I get up at 7.00am and    
 watch television for one hour. Then I 
 get dressed and have my breakfast.    
 Then I have my wash and go to town    
 with my mother and sister. We get fish
 and chips for our dinner and eat them 
 in town. We spend the rest of the     
 morning shopping. Then we come home.  
 In the afternoon I jog around Fossetts
 and Chancers. This takes 23 minutes.  
 After I have finished jogging  I play 
 football with my friends for the rest 
 of the afternoon. After tea I watch   
 television for the rest of the        
 evening. I go to bed at nine.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
