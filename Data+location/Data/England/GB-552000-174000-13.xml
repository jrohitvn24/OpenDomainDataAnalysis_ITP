		<content>How children who live in Dartford spend
their spare time?                      
Boys                                   
Most boys like playing on their bikes, 
watching television and swimming.      
Given more free time they would use it 
to play outside more and travel further
afield.  Given more money they would   
spend it on clothes.                   
                                       
Girls                                  
In their spare time girls like.        
shopping, listening to music and       
decorating their rooms.  Given more    
time they would do more sport, and     
spend more on clothes and travel.      
It seems that children in Dartford area
do very similar things in their spare  
time no matter what their age or sex.
