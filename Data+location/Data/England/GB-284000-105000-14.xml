		<content> The{Parish Church}was built in the    
 14th &amp; 15th centuries,probably on the 
 site of an earlier one.Since 1973 the 
 Rector has led a{Team Ministry,}      
 including two other incumbents,serving
 eleven parishes. A gallery, built in{ 
{1833}to accommodate the increasing    
 population, was removed in{1885.}In   
{1965}attendance was low, but picked up
 under a new incumbent who introduced  
 a sung{Eucharist}&amp; with his own hands 
 erected an altar for the Reserved     
 Sacrament. Six bells are rung         
 sometimes. The{Methodist}Church, built
 in 1860, is in the{Exeter Circuit}with
 a steady attendance. The adjoining    
 Methodist School Room supplements the 
 Parish Hall for meeting of Brownies,  
 Cubs, Guides, Youth Club and an{Agency
{on}Saturday mornings, where people    
 gather for coffee and to bring and buy
 goods.                                </content>
