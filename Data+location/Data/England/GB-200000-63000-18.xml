		<title>18THE LANIVET CARNIVAL</title>
		<content> Mr, Blatchford runs the carnival.Last 
 year the teasurer's caravan belonged  
 to Mr.Rohrs.                          
                                       
 There were lots of groups of          
 majorettes who were in competition    
 with one another. We had to book into 
 a tent if we wanted to take part in   
 the fancy dress. After the judging    
 there was the parade.Some people were 
 throwing water balloons about. Others 
 caught the balloons and threw them    
 back!The shop selling second hand     
 goods sold cups of tea for the        
 occasion.Most of the people at the    
 carnival came from Lanivet but some   
 came from Luxulyan and Bodmin.At the  
 end it was time for the announcements 
 of the prize winners.Right at the end 
 some boys were doing B.M.X. stunts on 
 the Green. It was fun.
