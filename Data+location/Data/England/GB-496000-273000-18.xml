As there are only a few shops in       
Ringstead,the children took home a     
questionaire to find out from where    
their parents bought the following     
items:-Bread,eggs,groceries,toys       
clothes,shoes,saucepans,furniture,     
televisions, cars,and gardening goods. 
The results of the survey are as       
follows:-Most people bought bread,     
eggs and some groceries in Ringstead   
but went to larger towns for most of   
their other needs.Kettering was the    
most popular  shopping centre for      
every type of goods with Raunds and    
Rushden next.Clothes and furniture     
were bought mostly from Northampton    
with Wellingborough the next most      
popular. A few people shopped in       
Milton Keynes, Leicester,Corby and     
London.As there is no bus service to   
Thrapston very few people went there.  </content>
