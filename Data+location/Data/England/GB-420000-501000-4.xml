		<content> On Monday evenings there is a computer
 class held in Moulton Village         
 Hall.This takes place at 7.00 p.m.    
 till 8.30 p.m.There are nine students 
 from Moulton who go and people even go
 from East Layton and Gatherley.There  
 are not many people who attend because
 you are expected to bring your own    
 micros and televisions .The small     
 number that do go range from 16 year  
 olds to Old Age Pensioners.           
      There used to be a Mixed Crafts  
 Evening Class held in Moulton Village 
 Hall until the Autumn of 1983.Then it 
 failed to reach its minimum number of 
 8 students .Because of the competition
 for students from Skeeby and Middleton
 Tyas,which hold similar classes,it was
 decided not to put it on again.       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
