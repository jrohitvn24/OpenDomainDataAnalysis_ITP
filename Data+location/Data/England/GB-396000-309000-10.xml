  In terms of housing the District     
offers a wide choice for an employer   
and key personnel whose firm may be    
setting up or expanding in the area.   
  It ranges from cheaper Victorian and 
Edwardian properties in some of the    
older communities to larger,expensive  
inter-war and modern houses in         
extensive grounds in Cannock.          
  Good quality, modern housing is      
available or being built on pleasant   
new estates in such places as Hawks    
Green.                                 
  On this estate and on smaller        
developments within older communities  
the range varies from two bedroomed    
houses and bungalows to 3 &amp; 4 bedroomed
detached houses.                       
  House prices are very reasonable and 
ae in easy reach of beautiful          
countryside-Cannock Chase.             </content>
