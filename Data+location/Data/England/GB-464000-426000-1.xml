 Like many other villages, Drax and    
 Barlow were at one time almost wholly 
 agricultural in character. Drax - from
 the Old English word Draeg meaning a  
 place where boats were lifted from the
 River Ouse and dragged overland to the
 River Aire - contains the site of a   
 mediaeval abbey and a Norman castle.  
 Barlow - from the Old English meaning 
 the clearing where barley was grown - 
 retains a 17th century chapel of ease,
 and the site of an Elizabethan manor  
 house.There is also a huge derelict   
 area which was formerly the site where
 airships were constructed and was     
 later used as an army ordnance depot. 
 With the progress of transport and    
 communications and the establishment  
 of new industries in the area, the    
 villages are now much less insular.   </content>
