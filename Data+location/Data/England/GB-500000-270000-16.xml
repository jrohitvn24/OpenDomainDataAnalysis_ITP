		<title>16HARGRAVE- THE NAGS HEAD</title>
		<content>                                       
THE NAGS HEAD is the public house in   
the centre of the village. It is about 
200 years old. It is owned by MR &amp; MRS 
MILLWARD. The pub is open from 10.30am 
until  3.00pm and from 6.00pm until    
11.00pm. On Sundays it does not open   
until noon in the mornings and 7.00pm  
in the evenings. It has a garden where 
you will find some swings, a climbing  
frame and a see-saw for children to    
play on. There is a field behind the   
garden which is used as a camp-site.   
The owners also keep some animals.     
Round the side of the pub is an old    
derelict shepherd's cottage which is   
now used to store things in. The pub is
important to the village because it is 
a place where people meet. We think it 
was called THE NAGS HEAD because it    
stands on land that was once ploughed  
by horses.                             </content>
