		<title>08WILLERSEY DUCK POND</title>
		<content>{Willersey}is a picturesque village    
 with stone houses and wide, well-     
 trimmed verges but its main attraction
 is the{duck pond}which lies beside the
 village street. Its circumference is  
 roughly 80 metres and it is surrounded
 on three sides by grass. The fourth   
 side is bounded by the garden of a    
 large house to which the pond once    
 belonged. In the centre is a small    
 island of Cotswold stones. The ducks  
 not only attract the tourists but also
 the local people who feed them on     
 stale bread. In 1977 a seat was put   
 beside the pond to commemorate the    
 Queen's Silver Jubilee. Originally    
 the ducks were domestic ones but now  
 they are mainly mallards. These hatch 
 their ducklings in nearby fields      
 and lead them through the village to  
 the pond quite unconcerned about the  
 passing traffic.                      </content>
