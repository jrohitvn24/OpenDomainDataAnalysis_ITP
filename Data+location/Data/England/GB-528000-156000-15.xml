 This km. square is divided in two by a
North/South line drawn through it. To  
the west of the line lies NE Chipstead 
where most of the housing in Chipstead 
is concentrated. This consists of very 
expensive private residences owned by  
city executives.                       
 To the east is SW Coulsdon, which is  
naturally divided by Rickman Hill. On  
the east side the houses are similar to
the above and on the west side an area 
of council housing. The council houses 
are occupied by families with children 
of school age and older. Since there   
are many young people in the area, the 
facilities for them have increased: a  
youth club in Portnalls Rd. and discos 
at St. Frances' Ch., Rickman Hill. The 
recreation ground: Rickman Hill Park is
used for Sunday league football and for
friendly matches.                      </content>
