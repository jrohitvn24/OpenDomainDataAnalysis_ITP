		<title>18 YARDLEY CHASE</title>
		<content>  In 1978 it was announced in a B.B.C. 
news bulletin that one of the          
possible sites for the third London    
air port was Yardley Chase. Part of    
the Chase is in our survey area.       
Eventually it was decided that         
'Yardley Chase was not the place'(one  
of the slogans)During our research for 
this project we have discovered that   
part of the site is now designated     
a Site of Special Scientific Interest  
(S.S.S.I for short).                   
The S.S.S.I is in a section which is   
used by the Ministry of Defence for    
training purposes A visit was arranged 
by the army in conjunction with the    
Northamptonshire Trust for Nature      
Conservation for us to see some        
of the wild-life in this protected     
area. There are a number of habitats   
present which support a variety of     
plants &amp; animals(some uncommon species)</content>
