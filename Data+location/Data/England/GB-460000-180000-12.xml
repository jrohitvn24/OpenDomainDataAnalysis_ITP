		<content>A local farmer,noticing that children's
knowledge of the countryside was weak, 
decided to set up a shceme to improve  
it.He set up a trust fund and with the 
help of the M.S.C employed six         
enthusiasts to go into schools in the  
immediate area  and work with the      
chilldren.Each class in nine small     
schools gets the assistance of one     
naturalist each day during the         
week.They take out small groups of     
children and go for walks,looking at   
the environment and the changes        
throughout the year.They may set up    
clubs or organise family walks, one    
set up a young ornothologist's club and
took out the members bird              
spotting.They may set up environmental 
areas in classrooms or around the      
school they have succesfully           
heightened the intrest and knowledge   
of the children.                       </content>
