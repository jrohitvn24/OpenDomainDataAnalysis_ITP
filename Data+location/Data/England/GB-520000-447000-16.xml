		<title>16WHERE WE PLAY IN HORNSEA</title>
		<content> We conducted a survey among           
 approximately 170 children from       
 Hornsea Primary School to find out    
 where they went to play in their spare
 time.                                 
 The majority of the younger children  
 played in their own garden or at a    
 friend's house. This is probably      
 because their parents thought this was
 safer. Not many of the younger        
 children were allowed to play in the  
 street, in the park or on the beach.  
 The park was a popular place to play  
 for the older children. Nearly 55% of 
 ten year olds and over 30% of nine and
 eleven year olds said that the park   
 was the place where they most         
 often played.                         
 Only between 5% and 15% of the        
 children between 7 and 11 years old   
 were allowed to play on the beach.
