		<content> Sandford House was built in 1858. It  
 was built by{Mr Miles.}Sandford House 
 is a big house. It look's like a      
 church from the front of the          
 house.                                
                                       
 There were stables for horses,        
 which were used to pull a carriage.   
 The attic was used for the maids'     
 bedrooms. There were eight bedrooms in
 the main house.                       
                                       
 There were lots of wild rabbits which 
 got in the garden and dug up the grass
 which made a mess. Sandford House is  
 tall and there are many trees around  
 it. The family went swimming in{      
{Sherford river}but they had to learn  
 to swim before they went. During World
 War Two, the family moved out of the  
 house, and it was used by the army.
