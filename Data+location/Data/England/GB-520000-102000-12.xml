		<title>12The Wildlife of Shoreham</title>
		<content>     A very distinctive feature of     
 Lancing's landscape is an area of     
 inland water behind the beach, called 
 Widewater. The area is to the west of 
 Shoreham. It is a shallow lagoon      
 parted from the sea by a low shingle  
 bank and covers an area of around 7.5 
 hectares with a 1 metre depth. The    
 bottom of Widewater is a very soft mud
 with a high organic content . During  
 the summer months the lagoon is       
 covered by a large mat of green algae.
    The local history of Widewater     
 dates back as far as the eleventh     
 century when it tells of an estuary   
 of the River Adur covering the area   
 where Shoreham Airport now stands.    
 There is another dating about 1250    
 when a shore drift of shingle was     
 built up to spilt the estuary from the
 sea.By 1700 streams to west of the    
 River Adur had been cut off.          </content>
