Navigation Farm is no longer a working 
farm. The land has been sold to another
local farmer, and the farmhouse is now 
used as student accomodation for the   
College students in Stafford. The      
farmhouse is situated beyond the       
railway line from Colwich to Stoke, and
beside the Trent and Mersey Canal. It  
was formerly a canal side Inn, where   
the Bargees could obtain refreshment   
and stable their horses for the night. 
The North Staffordshire Railway        
had a delivery arrangement with the    
Inn. Barrels of Beer were shunted from 
Colwich Junction and rolled down on    
incline to the Inn. It may be that     
heather gathered on nearby Cannock     
Chase was loaded here and carried to   
Stoke, where it was used as a packing  
material for crates of pottery.
