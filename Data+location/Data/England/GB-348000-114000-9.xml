		<content>{Odcombe Playgroup}has been running    
 since 1971. The most children we have 
 had is 18.The numbers vary every year.
 The last two years we have been close 
 to shutting down due to low numbers,  
 but we survived now we have eleven    
 children on the books. We are a       
 committee run playgroup. The committee
 is made up from mothers (fathers) of  
 playgroup children and also ones from 
 the{Mother and Toddler group}that we  
 also run. We have two sessions a week 
{ Wednesdays and Fridays from 9:15am   
{till 12}noon. We provide milk and     
 biscuits for the children.They must   
 bring soft shoes and a towel, both    
 named, in a shoe bag.We are a play    
 group, not a play school, as none of  
 the supervisors are teachers. All we  
 teach them is to play and mix with    
 other children.
