		<title>14BISHOPTHORPE JUNIOR SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Bishopthorpe Junior School has five   
 classes of children, and there are 167
 children in the school.  The          
 Headmaster is called Mr Matthews, and 
 as well as the five teachers there is 
 a secretary, a cook and two           
 assistants, a caretaker and two       
 cleaners, and two dinner supervisers. 
 There is also a part time teacher, and
 five specialist music teachers visit  
 the school to teach different         
 instruments. We have a small outdoor  
 heated swimming pool, and a large     
 playing field area, part of which we  
 hope to turn into a Nature Reserve.   
 The classrooms are built around a     
 central hall which is used for        
 assemblies, P.E. and other activities.
 We use a television and the radio, and
 have one microcomputer.
