		<content>Many buildings here are the legacy of  
Jerimiah James Colman, the great       
Norwich "Mustard King" who once lived  
in the village. Nearly all the Colman  
buildings have the initials J.J.C. on  
them plus the year of construction.    
All the Colman houses were properly    
sewered and had running water, this in 
a rural community before 1900 was very 
remarkable and farsighted.The bungalow 
opposite the Chapel (c. 1880) was      
former servants quarters and           
laundry,and Nos. 21 and 23 typical     
estate workers cottages of 1896. The   
Village Hall is quite a centre for     
village life and activity, with many   
groups meeting here regularly. It was  
built in 1890, and Gladstone, who was  
a friend of Colman and visiting here,  
gave the clock which is inside the     
Hall.
