		<content> Revidge Fold United Reformed Church   
 was formed in 1974, after divine      
 guidance through prayer, of a union of
 St George's and Four Lane Ends        
 Churches. Two years later a new wing  
 was added, providing a major          
 additional hall, stage, lounge,       
 kitchen and chapel area. Activities   
 provide regular Christian worship for 
 adults and young people,including     
 ministry of healing and wholeness;    
 eight groups meet regularly for Bible 
 Study and prayer, either on the       
 premises or in private homes; three   
 other fellowships are run for men and 
 women, plus two more for children and 
 teenagers, based on religious         
 instruction. Four uniformed sections  
 of the Scout/Guide movement are       
 associated; there is badminton, a     
 drama group, a modern religious music 
 group and a traditional choir.        </content>
