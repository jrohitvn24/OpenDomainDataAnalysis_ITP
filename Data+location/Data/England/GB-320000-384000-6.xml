		<title>06INTERVIEW WITH RETIRED MAN.</title>
		<content>   In interviews which the children    
 carried out,a number of people who    
 had lived in West Kirby for a long    
 time were asked about changes they had
 seen in the area and how they felt    
 about the differences.                
   One man who had lived in West Kirby 
 for over fifty years felt that there  
 had been a great deal of change.Many  
 of the open spaces have been built    
 upon and the new housing has tended to
 attract people who work elsewhere with
 a decline in the community spirit that
 was there when the population was much
 smaller.                              
   Other changes had been the closure  
 of the railway and the outdoor        
 swimming pool and the building of the 
 Concourse so that leisure facilities  
 are much more readily available than  
 they were when he was a child when he 
 had to find things to interest him.   </content>
