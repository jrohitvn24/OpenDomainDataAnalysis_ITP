		<title>11Health Services, Melchbourne</title>
		<content> The doctor's surgery that serves      
 Melchbourne is located at Sharnbrook, 
 a large village four miles to the     
 west                                  
 There is no bus available to          
 Sharnbrook, so people with no car have
 to rely upon friends and relatives to 
 take them to the surgery.             
 There is a dispensary attached to the 
 surgery and if a repeat prescription  
 is required the patient can send a    
 postal request and the medicene can be
 collected from the dispensary.        
 If hospital treatment is required,    
 then people travel to Bedford General 
 Hospital.                             
 Dentists and opticians are in either  
 Bedford or Rushden.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
