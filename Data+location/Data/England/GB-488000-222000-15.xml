		<content>    At 7.30a.m. my Dad leaves for work 
 and most other people go about that   
 time. There is a Community Centre on  
 the estate, where the Youth Club      
 meets.There are two small shops next  
 to the Community Centre, one is a     
 newsagents and the other a small      
 supermarket.                          
    There is a school which is over a  
 hill and down a path. It is called    
 Southcott Lower School. There are five
 years of pupils there.                
    When I play out I go up to the     
 Community Centre and play cricket or  
 football.There is a field round the   
 corner from my house where I play     
 football with my friends. My friends  
 live opposite the field. Down the road
 there is a little wood where we play  
 war in the camps we make. There are   
 fields behind the wood where wheat and
 barley are grown.                     </content>
