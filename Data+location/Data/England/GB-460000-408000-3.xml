		<content> The church of{St.Peter and St.Paul}is 
 built close by the River Don.It was   
 first mentioned in Domesday_"there was
 a priest and a church at Beorn".The   
 parish is semi_rural with industry in 
 the vicinity.The vicar is also        
 responsible for the very small church 
 at Kirk Bramwithtwo miles further down
 the River Don.The present church was  
 built in the 14th.C.,the 64'high tower
 followed in the 15th.C.There is a fine
{15th.C.font}and several examples of   
 beautiful{stained glass windows}dating
 from the same early period.The church 
 was fully restored in the             
 19th.C.(1859-62),the nave roof being  
 rotten and the chancel unsafe.The nave
 roof was replaced with the present    
 high pitched roof of Westmorland      
 slate.This fine church is surrounded  
 by a small graveyard which has an     
 overspill at the rear.                </content>
