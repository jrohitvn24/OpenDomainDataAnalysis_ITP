		<content> In our block there is a youth club    
 called Kirkby Boys Youth Club.It costs
 5 pence to get in, except on Wednesday
 when it is 10 pence because they let  
 the big inflatable mattress be used.  
 In the youth club there are space     
 invader machines and snooker tables   
 and sometimes films are shown in the  
 television room. There is a hall where
 the boys can play football and the    
 girls can play netball. On Thursday   
 evenings gym equipment is put out and 
 everyone can do gymnastics.           
 There is also a room for darts and a  
 place where younger children can do   
 drawings with one of the ladies who   
 work there. There is a football pitch 
 outside and all sorts of games are    
 played there during the summer and    
 winter.
