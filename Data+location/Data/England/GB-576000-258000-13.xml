		<title>13A DAY IN HARVEST cont.</title>
		<content>The drive home takes 10 mins. arriving 
home at 11.15am in time to make coffee 
for my husband and his secretary. I    
had left the washing machine going so  
I hung-out the washing, did some house 
work and prepared lunch. I am very fond
of gardening, so after lunch I started 
some weeding but after an hour I had to
take one of the tractor drivers to the 
casualty dept. of the hospital in Bury 
for an ex-ray following an accident on 
the farm, luckily he only sprained his 
ankle. This took 2 hours. Arrived home 
in time for tea with my husband.       
Started to prepare supper, boiled ham, 
carrots, onions, potatoes and runner   
beans followed by plum crumble and     
custard, all the vegetables being grown
in our own garden. My son and husband  
come in about 9.00pm after they have   
bathed we have supper. Days are long   
during harvest for a farmer's wife.    </content>
