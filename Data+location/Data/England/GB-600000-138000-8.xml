		<content>                                       
 This road runs due south/south_east   
 through the block. Starting in the    
 town centre it acts as a link with the
 farmland southwards to the sea,       
 serving as a market way for sheep and 
 crops.In the northern part of the     
 block the road is densely housed and  
 main building periods are easily      
 identified, late Victoria/Edwardian at
 the North end, 1920 &amp; 30s at the      
 centre and a few modern bungalow,     
 houses where it abuts the farmland.   
 One general food shop serves this area
 of the map, people preferring the town
 for bulk shopping. The Kingsnorth Road
 finishes at the town/parish border but
 continues on its way as the A2070 and 
 passes the village on its way         
 Southwards to Romney Marsh.
