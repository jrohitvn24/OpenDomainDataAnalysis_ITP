		<title>19Interview-Salts Avenue</title>
		<content>   A smart youngish woman of about 45  
 was walking up the road to get the dog
 she was looking after.  She had a     
 large house in Salts Avenue which is  
 about 50 years old.  The house was    
 detached with a gret tiled roof.  The 
 house was built of brick with a large 
 front garden, mainly lawn and rose    
 beds.                                 
   She had a son called Peter and had  
 moved from East Farleigh so that her  
 son could go to the grammar school    
 that was nearby.  She had an enormous 
 garden at the back.  Her husband      
 worked at the East Malling Research   
 Station.                              
   She went shopping once a week at a  
 supermarket in Larkfield.             
   She gave us a drink of orange       
 squash!
