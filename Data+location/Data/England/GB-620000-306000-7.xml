		<title>07MY HOUSE IN NORWICH</title>
		<content>{                                      
  My house was built in 1910 it has    
 seven rooms,three bedrooms,a sitting  
 room,dining room,kitchen and a        
 bathroom .Most of the houses are      
 terraced.My dad built a garage and a  
 bathroom.In our front door there are  
 stained glass windows,but they are    
 very loose from people slamming the   
 door.Our garden is quite small due to 
 our garage.We have two cars.We used to
 have a coal fire but now we have a gas
 fire because we have had central      
 heating installed.I live on Glebe Road
 which is just off Unthank Road.To get 
 to                                    
 our back door we have an alley which  
 leads to all of the houses,it is open 
 to cars as well.
