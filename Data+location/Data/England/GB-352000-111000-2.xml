		<title>02THE EAST COKER LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content>  The{landscape}is a varied one.In the 
 south there is a{flat topped ridge}at 
 about{350ft.}running from northwest to
 southeast from which the land falls   
 away fairly steeply on each side.The  
 rest of the land is low,about 175ft.  
 and the{slopes are gentle}or even flat
 in places.There are many small{streams
 running from west to east,many{springs
 as  well as the reservoir.            
                                       
  The area is{well wooded}especially at
 Coker Court Park.There are many farms 
 with{small fields}which are separated 
 by hedges many with trees among them. 
                                       
  There are several small{settlements  
 but East Coker and North Coker are the
 main ones.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
