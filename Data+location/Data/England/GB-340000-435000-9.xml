		<content> Some farms in the D block have land   
 under the plough.  Cash crops of      
 wheat, barley and potatoes are grown. 
 Trial crops of protein peas and oil   
 seed rape are grown.  World imbalance 
 of food has meant overproduction of   
 dairy products and corn.  Farmers must
 experiment with alternative crops for 
 cash and cattle feed.  Rents are high 
 up to Â£160 per hectare rising every   
 third year.  About half the farms are 
 tenanted.  Milk is on a quota system  
 reducing average turnover on dairy    
 farms by thousands of pounds.  Hedges 
 remain to confine animals.  Spraying  
 is used where intensive management is 
 needed.  Larger units are becoming the
 norm.  There is one horticultural unit
 which comprises glass houses and      
 market garden of 1.5 - 2.0 hectares   
 where salad crops, pot plants and cut 
 flowers are grown.                    </content>
