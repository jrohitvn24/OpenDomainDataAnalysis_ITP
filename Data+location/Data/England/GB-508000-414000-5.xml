		<content> At the canoe camp we walked over to   
 the tents, got our bags and put them  
 in the instructors' cars. We then set 
 off to a place on the River Lud where 
 we could launch our canoes. We got the
 canoes off the trailer and put them on
 the grass near the river. We had to   
 take them over the bridge and launch  
 them on the other side. Everybody got 
 into their boats and paddled down     
 stream until we got to the locks. We  
 had to pull the boats out of the water
 and put them in again on the other    
 side. We kept paddling until the next 
 lock and we had to walk around that.  
 We canoed almost to Louth and then we 
 ate our pack-ups. We had to sleep the 
 night in our tents by the river and   
 cook our own breakfast. We had bacon  
 and eggs but mine was burnt. Then the 
 next group came from school.
