		<title>08VILLAGE PLANNING - HALSETOWN</title>
		<content>  Here{local history}deserves a mention
 as Halsetown is Europe's first planned
 village.In 1832 James Halse, a local  
 mining adventurer, built it to house  
 his workers and gave it his name.     
 Each cottage sits upon a third of an  
 acre plot, which by the then new land 
 reform laws,gave the tenant{franchise.
 In this way Halse made sure of his    
 miners' votes, and regained his seat  
 as  M.P. for St.Ives.                 
  A vantage point on the road to       
 Penzance gives a clear view of the{   
{straight rows of cottages}in their    
 gardens of exactly similar size. They 
 are linked by lanes just wide enough  
 for a car. Luckily a conservation     
 order has preserved the appearance of 
 the village. Despite this, some have  
 obtained permission to put another    
 house on their plot. One hopes the    
 unique lay-out will be preserved.     </content>
