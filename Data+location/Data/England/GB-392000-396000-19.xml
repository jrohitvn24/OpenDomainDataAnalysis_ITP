		<content> The original{Christian}church was     
 built 87 years ago.In May, 1985 it is 
 being changed into a{mosque}.Muslims  
 and anyone who wants to know about    
 Islam can go to the mosque.The mosque 
 will be open at least five times a    
 week.                                 
  The muslims have a book called the   
{Quran}it is their holy book.There is a
 washroom for purifing yourself to     
 make yourselves clean.Muslims can only
 worship God if their body is clean.The
 people who come to the mosque remove  
 their shoes because if they have      
 stepped on any dirt they would tread  
 it onto the carpet which people sit   
 down on.                              
  The special days for the muslim      
 people to go to the mosque are the    
 Friday prayer, wedding's and funerals.
 The Muslim christmas is called Eid.
