		<content>    Frognall is a very small hamlet.   
 There are no shops but there are two  
 very old pubs.One was built in the    
 16th century.When we did a survey we  
 found that there were 31 detached     
 houses,2 semi-detached,19 bungalows,  
 and 2 chalets.Most of the houses were 
 built in the last twenty years.They   
 were made of brick with tiled roofs.  
 There were four old houses in the     
 village which date from about 1770.   
 These old houses are built of lime-   
 stone with Collyweston slate roofs.   
    The osier bed is low,wet,and forms 
 a bog.It is covered in reeds and rush-
 es. Its surface is uneven,there are   
 old willow trees across the middle.On 
 one side there is a hedge,and on the  
 other there is Spalding Road.Cows in  
 the next field can get into the osier 
 bed.You can see them on the drier part
 most of the time.                     </content>
