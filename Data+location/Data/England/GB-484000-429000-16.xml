		<content>  Newport is very lucky, as it has     
 three different places where people   
 can go to worship.The largest is the  
 Church of England church.This is a    
 large brick buiding, erected in the   
 last century.It has a spire and a bell
 tower with eight bells. The vicar,Rev.
 Robinson, says that it cost Â£160 a    
 week to keep the church heated and in 
 good repair.There are about fifty     
 worshippers each weekend.             
  In the centre of the village, there  
 is a Methodist chapel,dating from the 
 last century.Most of the buildings    
 date from the 1800's when Newport     
 began to develop, following the       
 cutting of the canal to drain the     
 land,and make housing possible.       
  The third place of worship is a small
 chapel, situated at the eastern end of
 the village.The people who are Roman  
 Catholics worship here.               </content>
