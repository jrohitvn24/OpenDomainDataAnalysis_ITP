		<content>    Several minor earthworks are       
 visible in the area. In{East          
{Torrington}the undulations marking the
 site of the former village are clearly
 visible in the field immediately north
 west of the church. In{West Torrington
 also,a field, surrounded by roads or  
 footpaths, shows the sunken tracks of 
 former roads and the raised house     
 platforms of the earlier village. The 
 modern village is mainly on the west  
 of this site.                         
    In{Bleasby }there is a very small  
 motte,surrounded by a ditch, and now  
 covered by trees.                     
    At{Collow,}just across the beck    
 from East Torrington, is the moated   
 site of Collow Abbey, now occupied by 
 a farm.                               
   {St.Gilbert of Sempringham}once held
 the living of West Torrington.
