		<content> The local village communities have to 
 fight to keep their amenities alive,  
 shops find it difficult to  compete   
 with town supermarkets. The village   
 Post Offices are uneconomical to run, 
 apart from being a social point they  
 also provide vital services especially
 for the elderly who find it hard to   
 travel the 10 miles to the town banks 
 and shops.Some people rarely enter the
 more expensive local shop and would   
 rather travel the distance regularly  
 or stock up into their freezers.      
{EMPLOYMENT}                           
     Unemployment is low even though   
 there is very little work locally, not
 in the villages nor on the farms.     
 People travel to the towns and other  
 large institutions (government and    
 university etc.) a very few commute to
 London daily (car then train). Workers
 to London and Cambridge are increasing</content>
