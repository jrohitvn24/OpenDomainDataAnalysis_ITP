		<title>01Estates around Kingston</title>
		<content> This area is largely owned, as it has 
 been for centuries, by two estates,   
 centred on Encombe House and Smedmore 
 House.                                
                                       
{Encombe House,}owned by the Scott     
 family since the early 19th Century,  
 is the focus of a large agricultural  
 estate including three quarters of the
 village of Kingston.                  
                                       
{Smedmore House,}on land owned by one  
 Ricardus at the time of the Domesday  
 Book, has been owned since then by the
 Smedmore and Mansell families.  This  
 smaller estate is supported by opening
 the house to the public and to        
 location filming, by a caravan site   
 and by the tolls from a private road  
 to Kimmeridge.
