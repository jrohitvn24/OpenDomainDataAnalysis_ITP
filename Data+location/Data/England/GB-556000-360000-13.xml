		<title>13HOTELS IN SKEGNESS</title>
		<content> There are lots of Hotels in           
 Skegness.Most of them are small,family
 businesses.The number of bedrooms in a
 small Hotel is about 11.In the bigger 
 Hotels there may be 25 or more.Most   
 Hotels are situated in the Drummond   
 Road area.There are also many bed and 
 breakfast houses in this area.        
 Recent tough new fire regulations     
 which made the provision of fire      
 escapes and extinguishers compulsory  
 have made things difficult  for hotel 
 owners.Also the prices of holidays    
 abroad have dropped,so that makes     
 competition harder.Some residents have
 turned private houses into holiday    
 flats,to make extra money.Many of the 
 hotels are licensed,with bars.This    
 makes the work more tireing.The       
 average price paid for bed and        
 breakfast is between Â£6.00 and Â£7.00.
