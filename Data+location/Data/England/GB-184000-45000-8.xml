		<title>08Village Questionaire (1)</title>
		<content>  Our questionaire showed that most    
 people liked the view, Tresillian, the
 river and the countryside.            
 Nearly everybody said they liked the  
 people because the people are         
 friendly.Most people said the main    
 reason for liking Tresillian is       
 because the people are friendly and   
 the population isn't great.           
  {What changes has Tresillian gone    
{through in the past years?}           
   Lots of people said that the roads  
 have improved greatly through the     
 years. But more traffic travels on the
 roads obviously that it did ever      
 before. Because of the main road, more
 people have come to live in           
 Tresillian.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
