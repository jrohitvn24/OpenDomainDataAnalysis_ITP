		<title>02LOCAL HISTORY OF SOUTHREPPS</title>
		<content> ORIGIN - Southrepps probably          
 originated in the ninth century as    
 "Repples" or cultivated land between  
 the wastes of heath, marsh and        
 woodland.   The village was part of   
 "SOKE OF GIMINGHAM", a federation of  
 villages;  later  royal estate.       
                                       
 SETTLEMENT - Within the parish are two
 distinct parts - UPPER STREET  and    
 APPLEYARD STREET or LOWER STREET.  The
 latter grew up in the medieval era as 
 an expanding population took up new   
 land and built homes on the far edge  
 of the manor.                         
                                       
 HISTORIC BUILDINGS - For centuries in 
 both parts of Southrepps people have  
 extended, altered and  rebuilt their  
 houses and shops.   Many buildings    
 show signs of having been used for 20 
 generations.                          </content>
