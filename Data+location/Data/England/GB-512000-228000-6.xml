		<title>06PEGSDON COMMON FARM</title>
		<content> The farmer owns the farm of 420 acres 
 and jointly manages 220acres of farm  
 land at High Down.The farm is arable  
 and beef cattle.The crops grown are   
 wheat,barley,field beans and oilseed  
 rape.The grain from the farm is sold  
 mainly to grain merchants,and the     
 cattle go to St.Ives for slaughter.   
 The field beans are used for animal   
 food,and for making dark flour,used in
 some breads on the continent,and the  
 rape seed is used for making oil.Rape 
 oil is more widely available in the   
 shops now.Wheat is for cereals and    
 flour and the barley for malt used in 
 distilling,and for beer and vinegar.  
 For all farmers,any grain of correct  
 quality not sold for other use ,can be
 sold to the Intervention Board,by whom
 it is stored for later use.Many       
 thousands of tonnes are stored in the 
 old brewery in Luton.                 </content>
