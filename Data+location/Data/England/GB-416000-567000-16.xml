		<title>16Butterlaw Farm.</title>
		<content>   Butterlaw Farm was built in 1850 and
 it has 220 acres of land, 25 acres of 
 winter barley and 20 acres of spring  
 barley.                               
   There are sixty cattle on the farm  
 and a Friesian cow with three         
 suckling calves.  There are no sheep  
 on the farm because stray dogs chased 
 them and thirty sheep fell in the     
 stream and had to be rescued.  There  
 are no horses on the farm.  The farmer
 has two dogs and one cat.  There are  
 five tractors on the farm and they    
 pull a plough, a harrow and a baler.  
 There is also a combine harvester.    
   There is an opencast coal site      
 beside the farm and the coal is       
 loaded on to lorries and taken away.  
 There were big heaps of earth on the  
 open cast site.
