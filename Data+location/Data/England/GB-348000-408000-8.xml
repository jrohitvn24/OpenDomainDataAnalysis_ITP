		<content>{    }   Four of the pupils (St.       
 Richard's High School, Skelmersdale)  
 had an interview with a Police        
 Constable, based in nearby            
 Skelmersdale, to ask him about crime  
 in the Parbold area. He said that     
 Parbold was a generally quiet and     
 peaceful village and there was not a  
 great deal of crime. The worst offence
 he could recall was a murder committed
 8 years ago, and a man reported that  
 on Christmas Eve 1984 all his         
 turkeys, chickens,pigs,cheese and pork
 had been stolen. There were worrying  
 signs, however, that there is an      
 increase in the number of houses      
 broken into  - to about 10 per year.  
         He did add that as the village
 had grown, they were finding that they
 were losing the personal touch, and   
 that people did not know each other as
 well.                                 </content>
