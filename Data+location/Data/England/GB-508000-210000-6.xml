		<content>{ Redbourn By_Pass}was opened in       
 November{1984}.                       
  Before Redbourn had a By_Pass all    
 traffic used the{A5}road which runs   
 through the centre of the village and 
 is known as the High Street between   
 the railway bridge in the south and   
 the junction with Harpenden Lane      
 (B487) in the north.Very heavy traffic
 uses this route and with lorries      
 unloading in the High Street and the  
 road being quite narrow several       
 traffic jams and accidents happened.  
   At rush hours there were long       
 traffic jams from the{B487}into the   
 High Street and from Harpeneden Lane  
 and the{B487 Hemel Hempstead Road}    
 junction at{Fish Street}into the High 
 Street.                               
  Several alternative plans for a{     
{By_Pass}were considered.
