		<title>15LOCAL NEWS IN MIDDLETON</title>
		<content> Middleton has it's own paper the      
 Guardian. On Friday 5th July 1985 the 
 front page news was a knife attack    
 hunt. A man who went to a local chip  
 shop was stabbed. Still to do with    
 chip shops-did you know that when you 
 pour vinegar on your chips that in the
 bottle are extracts of North Sea Oil? 
 Why put up with it when a local       
 vinegar factory has been manufacturing
 vinegar for 18 years. A local vicar   
 who has visited our school is moving  
 to the other side of Manchester.      
 Middleton Juniors football team have  
 done the treble, they have won the    
 league, league cup and the K.O cup.   
 Will Secondary Schools be closed or   
 will 11-16 year olds be mixed? It is a
 decision that hasn't been made yet by 
 the Education Committee. Letters to   
 the paper were on subjects like youth 
 clubs,fluoride in water and nurseries.</content>
