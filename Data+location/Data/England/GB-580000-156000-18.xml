		<title>18THE BLACK HORSE PUB</title>
		<content> The Black Horse, Thurnham has been a  
 public house for more than 200 years. 
 It is a relatively small pub with a   
 single bar, car park and paddock      
 containing a few tables for summer    
 use. The bar is furnished in a        
 traditional homely style with settees,
 easy chairs and open fires. At lunch  
 time the pub is mainly used by        
 business men from Maidstone and the   
 surrounding area and retired people   
 from nearby villages. In the summer   
 walkers on the Pilgrims' Way from     
 Winchester to Canterbury often call.  
 There are few people living nearby to 
 use the pub as their local, though    
 there are plenty of regulars of mixed 
 ages in the evenings, the peak season 
 being summer. There are about 1000    
 customers a week, and 15000 gals of   
 wine,spirits and beer is drunk per yr.
 Draught beer is 85p. per pint.        </content>
