		<title>04Clubs in Fremington</title>
		<content> There are 30 children in our class,   
 they have all sorts of hobbies.       
 They do them because some injoy them, 
 to relax, to learn, to keep fit or    
 self defance. Some people collect for 
 value others for the aesthetic        
 reasons. There are clubs in Fremington
 for football tennis, gymnastics,      
 cricket, judo cubs and netball. In    
 the summer holidays, the local        
 churches run a holiday club in the    
 school for the childern. In our       
 village there are no facilities for   
 judo, karati, swimming, babmington,   
 tap_dancing, tennis, horse riding,    
 squash or snooker. People have to go  
 elswere for them. Some adults are in  
 the Womens Institute this started when
 a group of women got together and     
 talked about how little there was for 
 grown ups to do in the village. They  
 do hobbies and charity work.          </content>
