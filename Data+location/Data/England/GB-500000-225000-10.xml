		<title>10SEWAGE TREATMENT 1</title>
		<content> Sewage is a mixture of substances from
 washing up water and waste to rain    
 water which is cleaned and put back in
 the rivers to use again.              
                                       
{PRELIMINARY TREATMENT.}The sewage when
 arrived at the plant carries          
 rags,paper and large stones.These     
 items have to be screened or it will  
 block sewage flows and pipes.The      
 method for this is that the sewage is 
 passed through a screen were it is    
 disposed of separately.               
                                       
{PRIMARY TREATMENT.}SETTLEMENT.the     
 sewage is passed through settling or  
 sedimentation tanks so slowly that    
 fine particles settle to the bottom   
 where it is then called sludge.The    
 sludge will be removed frequently each
 day for treatment or disposal.
