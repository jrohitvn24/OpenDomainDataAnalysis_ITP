		<content>  Southend is served by 2 main railway 
 lines. These are the Southend to      
 Fenchurch line and the Southend to    
 Liverpool St. line. In our area (the  
 Southend to Liverpool line) there is  
 the Southend terminus i.e.Victoria    
 Circus. It has two resident engines   
 which are both diesel, all other      
 traffic being electric.               
  There are over 400 employees working 
 from Victoria Station: 90 drivers,60  
 guards, platform staff, booking office
 staff, signal and telegraph           
 personel,maintenance men, engineers   
 and cleaners.                         
  Southend operates two types of train 
 to London. A twelve carriage fast     
 train and an eight carriage slow      
 train. The slow train has only 8      
 carriages because many of the small   
 stations have platforms which cannot  
 accomodate 12 carrtiages.             </content>
