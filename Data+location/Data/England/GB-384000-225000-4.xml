   The village used to be much larger  
 but at the beginning of the century   
 the river navigation was improved with
 a new weir downstream at Maisemore    
 which raised the river level by about 
 6 feet. This apparently made the      
 flooding worse in the fields between  
 the village and the River Severn so   
 that some cottages and farm buildings 
 were abandoned and the farmers changed
 their land use probably employing     
 fewer workers.                        
              {SCHOOLS                 
   There were 2 schools in the village.
 A Free School for Non-Conformist      
 children opened in 1859 and a Church  
 of England National School in 1862.   
 The last one closed in 1968. The      
 school meals used to be brought by van
 from Gloucester in metal containers.  </content>
