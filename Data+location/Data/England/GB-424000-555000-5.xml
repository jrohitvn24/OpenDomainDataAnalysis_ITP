		<title>05A SCHOOL DAY</title>
		<content> The day started with (assembly). We   
 heard stories and sang hymns. When    
 assembly was finished we either did   
 reading sheets or drew pictures       
 because half of the class was doing   
 (cycling proficiency) where they      
 learned how to ride a bike properly.  
 I did my (Ginn 36O) reading sheets.   
 the story was (The Ugly Duckling). I  
 had to answer question about the      
 story. Then the bell rang.            
    (Spelling) was next. We got a test 
 of words and they were all about      
 science. I got 13 out of 15. Then we  
 wrote out our spellings for the next  
 test. We had to learn them at home.   
    After dinner I went to the class.  
 We did (Art). In art I put paper over 
 my map with paste to make a relief    
 model. Then we got Singing. We sang   
 (Brer Rabbit) songs.
