 The oldest housing in the area of the 
 grid are the farmhouses such as       
 Fullingcott and Bickleton which can be
 traced back over 800 years. The hamlet
 of Instow Town contains cottages over 
 200 years old, one being the old      
 blacksmith's cottage. The hamlet of   
 Worlington on the other hand consists 
 of modern housing designed to take    
 advantage of the fine views over the  
 estuary. Along the main road ribbon   
 development has taken place with      
 larger estates now being developed.   
 The area is convenient for commuting  
 to Bideford and Barnstaple. However,  
 there are no amenities serving these  
 developments.
