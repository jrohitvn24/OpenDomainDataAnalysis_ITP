		<title>16 VILLIERS PARK-EDUCATIONAL</title>
		<content>    This is part of the Manor          
Charitable Trustees-it started in      
London in 1907,it was called the Eton  
Mission Boys' Club.                    
    Villiers Park is situated on the   
edge of Middleton Stoney and overlooks 
the private Middleton Park.            
    One of the founders was Arthur     
Villiers and the park aquired its name 
from him.                              
    The trustees started "Reading      
Courses" in the school holidays for    
advaced students to get used to        
"University life" and could revise in  
peace for their exams.                 
    The first of these courses to be   
held at Villiers Park was in 1965.     
    Arthur Villiers died in 1969 but   
the reading courses are still being    
held at Middleton Stoney,including     
industrial courses.
