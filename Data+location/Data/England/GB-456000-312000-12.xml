		<title>12QUARRYING IN MOUNTSORREL</title>
		<content>{ Mountsorrel Quarry,or Buddon Wood}as 
 it is known has been in existence     
 since 1828,and a{Roman bucket}has been
 found on the site.The material worked 
 is{granite.It produces two and a half 
{million tons of hard-rock granite     
{chippings for the construction        
{industry,especially the building of   
{motorways.It is the largest quarry of 
{its kind in Europe.}It was the first  
 place to make tar-coated granite      
 long before MacAdam.It is excavated by
 drilling holes then putting explosives
 down the hole and blasting it out.It  
 is then loaded into 85-ton dumper     
 trucks using mechanical excavators    
 mounted on tracks.A large crusher     
 reduces the shotrock to &lt;8ins100 men  
 are employed. A NEW TAR-MAKING PROJECT
 is causing some poeple concern,but    
 typifies the policy of progress       
 ensuring employment and fame.         </content>
