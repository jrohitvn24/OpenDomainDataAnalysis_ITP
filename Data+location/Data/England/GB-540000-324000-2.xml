 Rev. David Bratley, was made the vicar
 of the joint benefice of Fleet and    
 Gedney. This is a new office made by

    Over 300 people came to see the    
 bishop of Lincon perform the          
 ceromony. The new vicar swore oaths of
 allegiance to Her Majesty the Queen   
 and to the Bishop. The Bishop was     
 dressed mainly in yellow, had a tall  
 hat and carried a staff. A choir came 
 from holbeach and many other clergymen
 atttended to help in various ways.At  
 one point Rev. Bratley was given the  
 keys of two churches at the main      
 porch.                                
    After the ceremony,which lasted    
 over an hour, there were              
 refreshments. It was a happy occastion
 and the bells were rung.              </content>
