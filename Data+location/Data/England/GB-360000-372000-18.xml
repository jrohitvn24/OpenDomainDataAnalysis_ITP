		<content> In July 1985, a group of children went
 to interview the Reverend Marshall,   
 Vicar of Hartford Parish Church.      
        He told them that religion in  
 Hartford has changed a lot in the last
 few years. He now tries to attract his
 population by means of brightly       
 coloured posters at the gate and he   
 also uses films and videos to help him
 in his Christian teaching.            
         He has a busy working day, for
 even the church based part of his day,
 which is by no means the busiest, in  
 the first six months of this year has 
 seen  50 funerals, 32 weddings and 24 
 christenings.
