		<title>05Garton Wives Club</title>
		<content> Garton Wives Club was formed in 1970  
 when it was called Young Wives Club.At
 that time there were no other clubs or
 socials institutions and a number of  
 people felt that the village needed a 
 club for ladies.                      
 Officers are elected every year and   
 forty members are charged Â£1 a year   
 and 30p a month.                      
 Originally the club was associated    
 with the Church and membership was    
 restricted to Garton Parish.Falling   
 numbers brought about rule changes.   
 The name was changed to Garton Wives  
 and membership was extended to nearby 
 villages and Driffield.               
 The club meets once a month and a     
 variety of speakers are invited.      
 Members go on outings,shopping trips, 
 treasure hunts and visit the theatre. 
 All surplus income is given to a      
 variety of charities.                 </content>
