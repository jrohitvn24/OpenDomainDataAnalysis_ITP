		<title>08BRITANNIA PARK - CONTROVERSY</title>
		<content>{Britannia Park}is a Theme Park which  
 is being built in 350 acres of park   
 land just north of Ilkeston. The first
 phase has cost Â£18 million. The next  
 phase will cost even more.            
                                       
 It was opened against a background of 
 controversy. {Friends of Shipley Park}
 have fought two court cases against   
 the owners. The builders have also    
 been to court with nine different     
 cases against the County Council.     
                                       
 Although the project has found jobs   
 for{400 people,}local residents are   
 worried about the noise and congestion
 on the local roads.                   
 Even the opening was full of problems.
 The park was largely unfinished by the
 time that {Henry Cooper}performed the 
 opening ceremony.
