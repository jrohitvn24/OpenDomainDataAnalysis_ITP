		<title>15    Summertown Shops  Oxford</title>
		<content>   Summertown shops are frequently used
by local people although shoppers visit
Summertown from an average distance of 
up to four miles. In our survey most   
visitors liked to use Summertown       
shops as much as the City Centre.      
   The most popular transport is the   
car followed by walking. Not many      
people cycled that day because it was  
wet weather. Although more people came 
to Summertown for certain items rather 
than a normal shopping spree, the main 
shops used were Gateway, Budgens,      
Centre News and the greengrocers.      
   We calculated that an average person
visits Summertown three times a week   
and spends approximately fifty minutes 
each time.                             
   A popular complaint was parking. In 
the early eighties the cars drove into 
a diagonal space;this caused accidents.
   It is now horizontal parking.       </content>
