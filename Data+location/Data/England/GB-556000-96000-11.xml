		<content>    Walking across the Downs there is  
 plenty of evidence to indicate that   
 the area has been settled and         
 cultivated for thousands of years.    
 Tumuli and lynchets of iron age field 
 systems can be seen. Recent           
 archaeological work (1976) at Bullock 
 Down have discovered flint tools      
 dating back to 4000BC.                
    Settlemant and cultivation of the  
 land came 1000yrs later and although  
 the earliest evidence of man goes back
 to 4000BC, the area has only ever been
 sparsely populated. However, increase 
 in demand for corn in Roman times led 
 to a group of families settling.      
 During the Middle Ages the farmstead  
 at Kiln Combe was probably from       
 Birling Manor. In the sixteenth       
 century profits from wool led to much 
 of the land being turned to sheep     
 pasture and redundancy of labourers.  </content>
