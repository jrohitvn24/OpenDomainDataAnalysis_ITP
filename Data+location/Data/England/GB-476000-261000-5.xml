		<title>05 THE MOUNTS SWIMMING BATHS</title>
		<content>In 1935 the Mounts Swimming Baths was  
built on the site where the old prison 
once stood. The outside appearance of  
the building has hardly changed at all,
but the inside of the baths has been   
considerably altered since it was first
built, especially in the changing rooms
and locker area. The baths supply a    
numbr of activities during the week,   
and probably the most unusual of these 
is the scuba diving which is held on   
Thursday evenings. There are swimming  
lessons in progress every night of the 
week and these range from Beginners'   
lessons to advanced diving and swimming
coaching. The baths are open every day 
of the week for public use andd there  
are always lifeguards available. For   
the very young there is a mother and   
babies' pool. Another facility recently
available is the Health Suite for sauna
and massage treatment.                 </content>
