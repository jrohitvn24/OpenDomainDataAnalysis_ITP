		<title>12SHOPPING CHANGES IN WITHAM.</title>
		<content> In the late 1930's F.W. Woolworth's   
 store was opened, making a big        
 difference to local shopping. It was  
 known as the"3d and 6d" nothing sold  
 cost more than 6d (2pence now!). The  
 population was about 6,000.There used 
 to be tradesmen who went from door to 
 door,such as the Milkman who filled   
 your jug from the churn on the cart.  
 Greengrocery vendors and fish &amp; chip  
 men also had carts. The icecream man  
 came on a bicycle.                    
 Some of the small shops were Hannah   
 (grocer),Rose (greengrocer), Breatrex,
  and Hines ,(grocers/ confectioners), 
 Doole's (grocer and sub post office). 
 Newland Street had larger shops,Home &amp;
 Colonial, International, (grocers),   
 Luckin Smiths (ironmongers), and the  
 largest, The Co-op.There were two high
 class shops Hedley Cook (pork butcher)
 , &amp; Maison Carton (pastry cook).      </content>
