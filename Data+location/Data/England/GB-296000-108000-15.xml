		<title>15AT LEISURE IN BUTTERLEIGH</title>
		<content>     We set out a questionnaire for the
 people of Butterleigh to find out what
 they like doing in their spare time   
 and also what facilities they would   
 like to see in the area.Most people   
 do sewing,knitting,watching T.V,and   
 gardening and nearly all like walking.
     Some people would like more       
 facilities like a swimming pool with  
 cafeteria,something for the young     
 generation and a playing field. Some  
 people would like Butterleigh to stay 
 as it is.                             
     There is a Youth Club which meets 
 in the Village hall and members come  
 from Butterleigh and from Tiverton.   
 There are also Whist Drives from time 
 to time in the winter held in the     
 Village hall which are really a social
 event.
