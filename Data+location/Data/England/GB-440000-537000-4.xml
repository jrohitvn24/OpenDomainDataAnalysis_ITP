		<content> Roland Burdon II opened up Castle Eden
 Dene and helped the old and sick by   
 founding the Castle Eden Friendly     
 Society to produce insurance cover for
 70 years.In 1792 he helped start a    
 textile factory employing over 200    
 which failed because of the French    
 war.The factory clock is now used by  
 the local brewery.Real wealth came to 
 the area when mining spread from East 
 Durham in the 19th century.Families   
 came from all over England to work in 
 the mines at Maria Pit-Castle Eden    
 colliery,Heselden and Wingate colliery
 both sunk in 1840.In 1893 flooding    
 closed the Maria Pit but Wingate      
 worked until 1962.In the 1950's plans 
 were made to build Peterlee New Town  
 to provide up to date housing and to  
 attract new blood to the area.There   
 was a great deal of initial resistance
 to the idea.                          </content>
