		<title>03HOUSING IN HATFIELD</title>
		<content> HATFIELD STARTED AS A SMALL FARMING   
 VILLAGE,BUT WITH THE ADDITION OF A    
 ROYAL HUNTING LODGE,IT GREW IN SIZE   
 TO ACCOMODATE THE SERVANTS OF THE     
 MANOR HOUSE.THE OLDEST HOUSES ARE     
 ALONG THE MAIN ROAD,AND WERE BUILT BY 
 THE MANOR FOR ITS WORKERS.ONE OF THE  
 MOST INTERESTING HOUSES IS THE OLD    
 WORKHOUSE OPPOSITE THE CHURCH (BUILT  
 IN 1711).IT REMAINED AS THE PARISH    
 WORKHOUSE FOR 120 YEARS,UNTIL         
 1831,WHEN IT WAS CONVERTED INTO TWO   
 HOUSES.MOST OF THE HOUSING IN THE     
 VILLAGE TODAY WAS BUILT AFTER THE     
 SECOND WORLD WAR.THE NEW HOUSING IN   
 HATFIELD ARE MAINLY SEMI-DETATCHED AND
 DETACHED HOUSES THEY ARE ALL MADE OF  
 BRICK,LOCAL STONE BEING TOO EXPENSIVE 
 TO USE.THE PRICE OF THESE HOUSES RANGE
 FROM Â£18000 TO Â£35000,DEPENDING ON    
 SIZE AND QUALITY OF THE HOUSING.
