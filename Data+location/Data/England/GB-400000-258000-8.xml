		<content> Because of the location of the houses 
 in the area families rely on private  
 transport to reach most places. This  
 involves children relying on their    
 parents to take them to most          
 activities and younger children rely  
 on one mother organising with another 
 mother for them to play together. Many
 of the children are educated locally  
 although some attend private schools.
