		<title>01SHILLINGSTONE AREA</title>
		<content> Our area is in the Blackmore Vale.The 
 river Stour traverses it from North   
 West to South East, and the valley is 
 bounded on South West by Shillingstone
 and Okeford hills,and on the East by  
 Hambledon Hill. The hills are formed  
 of Middle Chalk,and the valley from   
 Greensand and alluvial deposits.      
 There are three small vllages,known   
 locally as the Three Okefords:Childe  
 Okeford,Okeford Fitzpaine and         
 Shillingstone(once called Shilling    
 Okeford).All three have been inhabited
 since at least Saxon times.There is a 
 small hamlet in the North West called 
 Fiddleford,where there is an old mill 
 on the river.The area is mainly       
 farmland(,mostly dairy with some      
 arable,) and woodland,with some       
 light industry.Population includes    
 commuters,the retired and farmworkers.
