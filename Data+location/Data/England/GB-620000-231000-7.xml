		<title>07ALL SAINT'S CHURCH</title>
		<content> The church, next to what was the      
 village green,is a very interesting   
 piece of{local history.}The present   
{building}dates from around the 14th   
 century and was once the site of a    
 famous{Rood or Cross.}Pilgrims used to
 travel from all over to see this, and 
 it was supposed to have certain       
 special qualities.In 1532, a group of 
 four men from Suffolk entered the     
 church and took the Cross onto the    
 green where they proceeded to set fire
 to it.This was seen as such a terrible
 crime that three of the men were      
 caught and within six months all had  
 been hung. One of the three, Roger    
 Marsh was hung on the green itself.   
 Unfortunately there are no stories    
 about his{ghost}returning to the      
 scene. Today the church is the centre 
 of the{Church of England}ministry in  
 the Harwich area.                     </content>
