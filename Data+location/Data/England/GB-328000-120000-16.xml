		<title>16HATCH COURT I</title>
		<content>   Hatch Court is an eighteenth century
 mansion built of bathstone in the     
 Palladian style. On the south front   
 there are five arches and the roof has
 four pyramidal towers.                
   In the hall, there is a very        
 spectacular staircase made of portland
 stone. There are also huge Ionic      
 columns and a massive oak table with  
 matching benches.                     
   In the drawing room, there is a big 
 bay window that looks out onto the    
 garden and pool. There is also a      
 nineteenth century sideboard and a    
 nice equestrian painting.             
   In the library, which used to be    
 part of the drawing room, there are   
 lots of books and three unusual corner
 cabinets.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
