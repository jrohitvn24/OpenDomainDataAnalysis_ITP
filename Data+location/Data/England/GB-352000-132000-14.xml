		<content>    Butleigh and Baltonsborough formed 
 part of the estate of Glastonbury     
 Abbey until the Dissolution. After    
 this time Butleigh remained in the    
 family of the Squire whereas          
 Baltonsborough was divided into small 
 owner occupied farms.                 
    Barton St.David was, from          
 Domesday times, sublet into small     
 farms and now appears as a ribbon     
 development along the roads. In both  
 Baltonsborough and Butleigh the       
 villages were centred around the      
 Church and then expanded.             
    The villages have changed during   
 the second half of the twentieth      
 century from self_sufficient,         
 agricultural communities to largely   
 dormitory villages with considerable  
 house building from the 1960's.
