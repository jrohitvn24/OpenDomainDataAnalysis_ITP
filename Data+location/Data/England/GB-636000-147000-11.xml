 Kingsdown is generally a law abiding  
 community. Very few people's houses   
 have been burgled but quite a lot of  
 property has been stolen from the     
 neighbourhood.There are a few vandals 
 in the village.A couple of people have
 been attacked,but not many people seem
 to be worried about going out at      
 night.Many young people get into      
 trouble and other people think this is
 because there is not enough for them  
 to do and they are bored,so they would
 like more things to be organised for  
 young people.                         
 Lots of people do not think modern    
 parents do their job properly.        
 The majority of the village think that
 the law is firm enough with criminals 
 apart from when it comes to           
 murder.They then think there should be
 longer sentences.                     </content>
