		<content> There is only one vicar for the       
 Cranmer group of parishes. He goes to 
 each of the six churches in the area  
 in turn. He goes to two of the        
 churches once a week and the remaining
 four churches once every other week.  
 Whatton is the largest of the churches
 and Thoroton is the smallest in       
 between come Hawksworth, Scarington,  
 Aslockton and Orston. The vicar goes  
 to all six churches because the       
 villages are too small to support     
 separate vicars.This makies life very 
 difficult, as the vicar has the worry 
 of six churches instead of just one.  
 There is a Curate who assists the     
 vicar but his time is mostly spent at 
 the nearby "Whatton Detention Centre".
 The church is very important in the   
 villages, as most events are organised
 through it. It also has part control  
 of Aslockton primary school.          </content>
