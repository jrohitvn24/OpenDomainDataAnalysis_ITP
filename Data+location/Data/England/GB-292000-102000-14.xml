		<title>14   Silverton Hallhouses</title>
		<content>    We believe Silverton is unique     
 amongst Devon villages in having a row
 of fourteenth century {Hallhouses.    
 These are of cruck beam construction  
 with walls made of Devon cob and roofs
 of thatch. They derive their name from
 the fact that they were originally    
 built of a single storey without a    
 chimney. Smoke from the fires found   
 its way out through the roof, and     
 evidence of this can still be seen on 
 the roof beams today. At a later date,
 this large room was divided by means  
 of an upper floor, and a chimney was  
 added to the outside wall.            
                                       
    Fortunately, despite their thatched
 roofs which increased the risk of     
 fire, the{Hallhouses}have survived    
 to the present day and are now listed 
 buildings.                            
                                       </content>
