		<content> Generally, local health is very good, 
 and people live to about 80+ without  
 serious illness.Climate &amp; living      
 conditions combined with excellent    
 medical care make this possible. The  
 local {SURGERY}is sited in a converted
 yeoman's house,and is run by a team of
 3 Doctors,headed by Peter Christopher,
 backed by 4 staff.About 50 patients a 
 day go to the Surgery,serious illness 
 beng treated at {HOSPITAL} in Banbury,
 Leamington or Warwick.If required, the
 Doctors visit patients in their own   
 homes, working in shifts, with one    
 Doctor always on 24 hour all.There is 
 an {AMBULANCE SERVICE} available as   
 needed as transport to Hospital. This 
 service works closely with the{POLICE

 the ase of Road Accidents or house
