		<content>  {STRIP FARMING.}                     
 Epworth and the surrounding area is   
 one of the few places in Britain where
 strips of land from the medieval      
 practice of strip farming can still   
 be seen.In this system long,narrow    
 strips of land were owned and         
 cultivated by different people so land
 of differing quality around the       
 village was shared out equally.In most
 areas these strips have been combined 
 to make bigger fields though here some
 still remain.                         
{  DAIRY FARMING.                      
 Dairy farms are rare in our area,there
 being only two or three herds in our  
 block.This is mainly because the land 
 is more suited to arable farming which
 is more profitable.Many small farmers 
 who kept a few cows have in recent    
 years had to dispose of these due to  
 hygiene regulations.                  </content>
