		<content>Mr. Bell is a parent of one of the     
pupils at school. He is the Area NFU   
Secretary and he volunteered to tell   
the class about farming in the area.   
Farming is still traditionally a family
concern in this area. There is a large 
proportion of owner occupied farms     
which are usually passed on from father
to son.                                
Education, science and technology have 
made a tremendous impact on farming    
during the last 20-30 years. Improved  
machinery, chemicals and biological    
factors all play a very important role 
in modern farming techniques.          
Mr. Bell is confronted with all types  
of problems in his work and he feels   
that there are still pressures in      
farming that others do not appreciate. 
EEC policies, animal related problems, 
high capital investment worry today's  
farmers, though many enjoy their work. </content>
