		<title>02CUFFLEY AND NORTHAW-ORIGINS.</title>
		<content>  The name Cuffley first appeared as   
 Kuffele in 1228.Through the years it  
 had many different spellings until    
 1600 when it became Cuffley.It is     
 thought to come from a personal name  
 Cuffa and leah meaning a clearing in a
 wood.In 948 Northaw was known as North
 Haga or Northaga meaning North        
 Enclosure.In 1750 it became known     
 under its present name,having been    
 North Haugh and North Hall.Neither    
 village was mentioned in the original 
 Domesday Book. Evidence of a Roman    
 road through the village was found    
 when Cuffley hall was built in 1971.  
 However,there is no evidence of       
 settlement in Cuffley during the Roman
 period and the road was probably soon 
 engulfed by woodland.In 1842 a cottage
 was licensed as The Plough beerhouse. 
 The 1851 Census showed eighty people  
 living in Cuffley.                    </content>
