		<title>09Religion in Heybridge</title>
		<content>    The area in and around Maldon and  
 Heybridge has a strong history of{    
{religious}influence. Indeed, at       
 Bradwell are the remains of one of the
 earliest Christian churches in the    
 land.                                 
    However, in a survey conducted in  
 and around Heybridge the results of a 
 question asking about church          
 attendance revealed a very low        
 percentage of regular church-goers.   
    The question asked was :           
 "Do you reguarly attend a church      
 service?"                             
                                       
 Results : 6% answered Yes             
                                       
 (Note : Heybridge has been without a  
 vicar for over a year and, although   
 there are other churches in the       
 locality, the results of the survey   
 may have been adversely affected.     </content>
