		<content>    Most of the crops around here are  
 wheat and barley but rape is also     
 grown. These are harvested the same   
 way but maze is cut by a special      
 machine. When harvesting a long time  
 ago, there had to be about twenty     
 people to do one field but now we have
 machines, it only takes two people to 
 harvest a field. The machines are     
 called Combine Harvesters and Tractors
 and Trailers.                         
    The silage, the grass cut during   
 spring and summer for animals to eat  
 in the winter, has to be kept under   
 cover. This is usually made of black  
 plastic. This keeps the silage dry as 
 the cattle will not eat the silage if 
 it is wet.
