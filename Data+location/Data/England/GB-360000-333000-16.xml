 Boundary Farm.                        
   The first house is called Marsden   
 Lodge.The owner has seven goats and   
 keeps bees.The owner of the second    
 house is the Matron of Quarry House   
 for old people in Market Drayton.The  
 third house was built in about 1785.  
 It has two acres of mixed woodland.

 about 100 feet below sea level and the
 soil is peat.The road leading to      
 Smythemoor has recently been repaired 
 because it began to sink.Smythemoor   
 lane is unadopted and full of potholes</content>
