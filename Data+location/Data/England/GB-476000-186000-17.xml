		<content>Lady Hambleden has been chairman of    
Hambleden School governors since 1948. 
She is lady-in-waiting to the Queen    
Mother. On Wednesday,8th May,Lady      
Hambleden attended the service at      
Westminster Abbey to commemorate V.E.  
Day. The purpose of the service was    
threefold.It stressed reconciliation,  
gratitude and also hope for the future.
The latter was illustrated by the      
children from the Royal Ballet School  
who carried posies of white flowers and
laid them in the shape of a cross.This 
showed the world that the youth of     
today has a part to play in our        
future.Lady Hambleden spoke of the     
Queen Mother's love of people,         
particularly children,of her humility, 
her love of gardening,interest in      
racing and her knowledge of television 
programmes.Her duties can be harrowing 
when she sees starving people abroad.  </content>
