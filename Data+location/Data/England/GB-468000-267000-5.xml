		<title>05FARMING - A DETAILED LOOK</title>
		<content> CANK FARM HAS A HISTORY OF EXPERIMENTS
 TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY. EVEN WHEN IT   
 WAS A DAIRY FARM THERE WERE REGULAR   
 INNOVATIONS TO IMPROVE MILK YIELD. ONE
 METHOD WAS THAT OF THE PADDOCK -      
 FIELDS WERE SPLIT INTO 4 PADDOCKS AND 
 COWS WERE GRAZED ON DIFFERENT SECTIONS
 EACH DAY SO THAT PASTURE WAS FRESH.   
 THE ALTERNATIVE STRIP METHOD MOVED THE
 GRAZING AREA DAILY IN A 6 FEET STRIP -
 ELECTRICALLY FENCED - FOR FRESH GRASS.
 CROPS NOW GROWN ARE MAINLY CEREALS    
 LIKE WHEAT, BARLEY AND RYE. THIS FARM 
 HAS NEVER GROWN SUGAR BEET AS A BREAK 
 CROP BUT USES THE MORE POPULAR RAPE   
 FOR THIS PURPOSE, IN COMMON WITH MANY 
 OTHER LOCAL FARMERS. MOST FARM JOBS   
 ARE NOW DONE BY CONTRACTORS - SO THAT 
 PLOUGHING, SPRAYING, DRILLING,HEDGING 
 AND COMBINING ARE DONE BY SPECIALISTS.
 CORN IS CARTED WITH TRACTORS AND      
 TRAILERS BY THE FAMILY.               </content>
