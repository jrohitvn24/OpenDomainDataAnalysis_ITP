		<content>   The local School has closed and the 
 nearest schools are at Kineton.The    
 Church at Chadshunt is C of E but has 
 only a small congregation and shares  
 its Vicar with the church at Kineton. 
 The nearest Doctor and Dentist are at 
 Kineton also and the nearest Hospitals
 at Warwick and Leamington. Even the   
 nearest shop to the area is a small   
 village store at Gaydon where the only
 policeman lives.                      
   There are few community activities, 
 therefore, though harvest festival and
 Christmas festivities still survive.  
   Some old people in the area are     
 catered for by Meals on Wheels.
