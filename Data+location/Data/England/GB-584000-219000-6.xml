 pillars.The roof has recently been    
 restored and new oak beams have been  
 fitted.All of the woodwork in the     
 church is made of oak, even the door  
 which has been there since 1400.      
    In 1330 the{chapel}and the{chancel 
 were built.The chapel has many        
 antiques including the picture of     
 Christ painted by John Constable.The

 way, it was built 400 years ago.Small 
 Tudor bricks have been cut by hand    
 and copper has been put on the        
 windows to prevent condensation.

 end of the Nave.The pipes go          
 underground to the other end of the   
 Nave and the organ pipes.
