        This D-block lies two miles    
 south of the North Yorkshire Moors    
 National Park. The only centres of    
 population are the rural villages of  
 Nawton/ Beadlam and Wombleton. The    
 former lay on the A170, the main      
 east-west route between Thirsk and    
 Scarborough. Nawton/ Beadlam lies     
 three miles east from Helmsley and    
 three miles west from Kirkbymoorside. 
        These villages lie towards the 
 western end of Ryedale and on the     
 northern edge of the Vale of          
 Pickering. This is a rural area with  
 enclosed arable fields and pasture    
 land surrounding farms and villages.  
 In appearance, the countryside has    
 cahanged  little over the past two    
 hundred years.
