		<title>05Housing types in Trent-Vale.</title>
		<content>In this area there are many different  
types of housing.The great majority of 
houses are semi-detached with gardens. 
In some areas there are large detached 
houses and bungalows with big gardens. 
Towards Stoke town centre many streets 
are terraced houses with small back    
yards.Many streets have shops over     
which people live.There are no large   
blocks of flats in this area,although  
there is a small block of about thirty 
flats.Most housing is privately owned  
although there are two small council   
estates.Many of the terraced and older 
property date back to the Victorian    
days,but as we go out from the town    
centre the property is younger,dating  
from the 1940's up to housing that is  
being built in the 1980's.
