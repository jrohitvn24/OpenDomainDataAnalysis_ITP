The Chapel of St.Chad was built before 
900AD while the De Colwyches lived     
here. The Nave and Chancel are said to 
be mediaevil. A Chapel of Ease of      
Colwich Church was built for the Third 
Lord Anson at Great Haywood. This is   
now St.Stephen's Church. A family vault
for the Anson's can be found at St.    
Michael's behind panelling, entered    
through a trap door. The East Window   
commemorates Thomas, The First Earl of 
Lichfield. Charlotte Sparrow, founder  
of Colwich School, and James Trubshaw, 
a builder and civil engineer are also  
remembered here. Trubshaw is buried in 
the South Aisle. He worked on several  
local bridges, and his son Thomas      
designed St. Stephen's. The church has 
a Tower with clock and six working     
bells, which were installed in the mid 
seventeenth century.                   </content>
