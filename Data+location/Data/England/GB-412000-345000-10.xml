The Memorial Hall houses a variety of  
activies,one of the few for women is   
"Keep Fit". Also held at the Memorial  
Hall is Mayfield's W.I. which meets    
once a month. The Senior Social Club   
meet at the Memorial Hall too. This is 
a thriving club for the over sixties.  
They play Bingo,listen to visiting     
speakers,enjoy refreshments and        
organised outings.                     
However in this area if they want to   
swim, play tennis,squash or go to a    
disco the people would have to travel  
to Ashbourne, only two miles along the 
A 52.
