 School is 2km SSE of Cirencester.A 100
 years ago a church was demolished and 
 the school built of the stone.Glos.   
 County Council pay for all repairs,but
 the school has to supply the materials
 There are 5 teachers,one a remedial   
 teacher,a cook and a cleaner.There are
 91 children aged 4 to 11 in 4 classes.
 Many children cycle to school because 
 of its isolated site.They attend from 
 9 am to 3.45 pm.There is a reserve in 
 the grounds which is used for nature  
 study.In the winter boys play football
 and girls play netball.In summer boys 
 and girls do athletics.Music,sport,art
 and craft are the children's favourite
 subjects.The local Vicar,Rev.P.Sudbury
 takes a close interest in the school  
 and is chairman of the Governors.     </content>
