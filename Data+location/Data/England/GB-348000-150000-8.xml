		<title>08RODNEY STOKE VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Not all of the village lies within the
 survey block but the linear settlement
 built along the A371 contains some    
 interesting variations. The main road 
 is narrow and particularly busy in the
 summer tourist season and many of the 
 houses open straight on to this road. 
 It is difficult to walk in safety     
 along the road because there are blind
 corners. Most housing is old ,several 
 buildings dating back to the          
 eighteenth century at least in part . 
 Old farm houses, such as Newell Farm, 
 Manor Farm and Holly Farm dominate and
 are made of natural dolomitic         
 conflomerate and some limestone. In   
 filling in recent years for example in
 Stoke Street, contrasts strongly with 
 imitation stone commonly used, whilst 
 Smiths Close is a good example of a   
 twentieth century council house       
 terrace, built in red brick.          </content>
