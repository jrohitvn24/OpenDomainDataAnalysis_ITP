		<content>The Square.                            
Overlooked by the ancient stones of the
Saxon Tower and Norman Church standing 
on their Prehistoric castle mound, the 
crossroads known as the Square is the  
hub of Earls Barton.                   
  Several yards give their address as  
The Square,and in these yards many     
small businesses thrive- carpenters,   
funeral directors,model-makers,dental  
technicians and trades allied to the   
boot and shoe industry.                
  Shops and banks surround the Green on
which until the turn of the century    
stood the parish pump.Three of the main
banks maintain busy branches,and       
several Building Societies exist round 
the Square.A large and busy Post Office
faces the church.The commercial centre 
of the village is completed with a Fish
and Chip Shop,hairdressers,Restaurant, 
Chemists,Butchers and Doctors Surgery. </content>
