		<content> A member of most households has       
 consulted a doctor during the year -  
 mainly a General Practitioner from    
 neighbouring villages - Sawston,      
 Newport, Barley, Gt. Chesterford.  The
 majority of patients travel to surger-
 ies although there were a few home    
 visits.  The nearest hospital is      
 Addenbrookes, Cambridge - 15 miles    
 away and Saffron Walden. People travel
 to dentists, opticians and chiropod-  
 ists in a variety of directions -     
 Saffron Walden, Shelford, Cambridge,  
 Royston.  A General Practitioner      
 visits Chrishall village twice weekly 
 for open-surgeries.  There are also   
 visits by a District Nurse and Health 
 Visitors.
