<title>22Stanmore Park - ex RAF</title>
<content>RAF Stanmore Park was opened in 1939 and closed in 1997.  The site was developed with relatively high density housing:  a mix of flats and houses, privately owned and social.  Some RAF housing is still there, but empty and due for demolition. &lt;br />&lt;br />Stanmore Park has a Children's Centre and Community Centre with a nursery school and Air Cadets - 2236 (Stanmore) Squadron.&lt;br />&lt;br />The southern edge of the site bordering Temple Mill Pond has been landscaped with pedestrian and cycle paths and a small playground.   &lt;br />
