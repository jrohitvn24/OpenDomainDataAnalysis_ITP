		<content>   My house is about 17 years old and I
live at 14,Oak Drive,Seisdon.There is  
a new housing estate just down the     
road. It is roughly one mile from      
school. It is detached and built of    
brick. The site was a field before. We 
have a garage which can hold two cars  
and some gardening equipment.There are 
four bedrooms,a playroom,a kitchen,    
living room,three toilets and two      
bathrooms.                             
   My dad is a Dental Surgeon.         
We have two dogs who are brothers and  
are 7 years old. I have 5 fish in a    
fairly big pond.                       
   On a school day I get up at 7-40    
a.m. dress and go downstairs to have   
some breakfast. I brush my teeth and   
set off for school. I usually go by    
car. We always start with mental       
arithmetic.
