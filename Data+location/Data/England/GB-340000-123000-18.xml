		<content> Muchelney is a small village south of 
 Langport_the name means 'The Great    
 Island'.At one time the whole         
 neighbourhood was marshland with only 
 one or two areas above flood level.   
 Many of the fields are only 25 feet   
 above sea level and before the pumping
 stations were built it was quite usual
 for Muchelney to be cut off for long  
 periods during the winter.Muchelney is
 widely advertised as a place for the  
 West Country visitor to explore.Within
 walking distance of each other is a   
 toll house restored in 1983 and now a 
 cafe,the 15th century Priest's House  
 owned by the National Trust,a 15th    
 century church and the abbey. 5,904   
 people saw the abbey in 1984.The      
 village no longer has its school or   
 post office but it is well served by  
  the milkman,baker,grocer,hardware van
 and the travelling library.           </content>
