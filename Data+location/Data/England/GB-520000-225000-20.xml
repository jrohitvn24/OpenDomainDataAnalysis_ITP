		<title>20GRAVELEY and GARDEN CENTRE</title>
		<content> Travelling northwards out of Stevenage
 along the old Great North Road you    
 come to a garden centre. This centre  
 has grown with Stevenage. It has a    
 wide range of plants for the house and
 garden. Garden centres are very       
 popular these days because people like
 to have attractive plants in their    
 homes and gardens but like to buy them
 already growing instead of growing    
 them from seeds. A quarter of a mile  
 along the road is the little village  
 of Graveley. It is very old. It was   
 given to William Ewe by William the   
 Conqueror.  The Normans built a church
 in the village but there is only a    
 small part of it left now most of the 
 church has been added by other people 
 since then.  There are two pubs in the
 village and up the lane behind one of 
 them are two ponds with a lot of ducks
 and some moorhens and fish.           </content>
