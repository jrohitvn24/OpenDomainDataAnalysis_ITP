		<content> GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF BLOCK          
{This twelve square kilometre area is  
{on the Dip Slope of the South Downs   
{north of Hove. Part of the deep dry   
{valley known as the Devil's Dyke is in
{square 2610. Most of the land is      
{farmed, arable or grazing, in rotation
{and there are three farm houses.There 
{are two Golf Clubs, each with a Club  
{House and there are small areas of    
{scrubby trees, mostly hawthorn, elder 
{and gorse. There is a minor road from 
{Brighton going north but no public    
{transport.A branch of this road leads 
{to the Devil's Dyke. The South Downs  
{Way, long distance footpath traverses 
{the scarp of the Downs and a number of
{ancient tracks, which are rights of   
{way,cross the area from north to      
{south.The advent of the tractor which 
{allows the cultivation of steep slopes
{has destroyed the open Downland here.}</content>
