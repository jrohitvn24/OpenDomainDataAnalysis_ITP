 Police.Simmond saw a car entering the 
 pub car-park a few minutes later and  
 dashed outside to ask for a ride.     
   The plain-clothes officers in the   
 car were happy to oblige and drove him
 straight back to the prison.          
   A second prisoner tried to escape   
 with Simmonds but sprained his ankle  
 before he reached the security fence. 
   A spokesman for the Home Office said
 Simmond escaped by scaling the        
 security fence,running acrosswaste    
 ground and climbing over a            
 contractor's gate.                    
   Simmond,from Barking,Essex,was      
 sentenced to 15 months last year for  
 entering a building as a              
 tresspasser,for three charges of theft
 and one of deception."
