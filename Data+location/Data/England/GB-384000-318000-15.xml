year and look after such things as the 
playing field,the fences,the roads and 
telephone box,notice boards,litter     
bins,help with the churchyard and      
run a playscheme.The money to do this  
comes from a big office in Stafford,   
the Borough Council,and is part of the 
rates.The Parish Clerk looks after the 
money,she pays the bills  and does the 
accounts.Upstairs in her house she has 
a little office in a corner of a room  
where she keeps her blue typewriter on 
a big desk and a cupboard full of      
folders. She writes letters and        
telephones, arranges for the fences to 
be mended and the swings to be painted 
in the playing field,and the roads to  
be cleared when it snows.              </content>
