		<title>18THE VILLAGE OF BORDEN</title>
		<content> Borden is a small village,south of the
 A2,about 1\ miles from Sittingbourne. 
 It is generally a very quiet place to 
 live but at peak times people use     
 Borden as a short cut to and from the 
 motorway.Borden has a sub post-office 
 but no bank;a general store,a craft   
 shop,a pub and at Oad Street,a        
 blacksmith.The houses are 'up-market'.
 Some very modern,others very old.There
 are farm workers cottages and a small 
 council estate called'Mountview'.Some 
 people say it is the best of both     
 worlds because it has the benefit of  
 the country-side with easy access to  
 Sittingbourne town centre.There is a  
 community atmosphere and about 100    
 people attend each church service with
 an average of 30 weddings a year.Even 
 in this haven glimpses of vandalism   
 can be seen in the children's         
 playground.                           </content>
