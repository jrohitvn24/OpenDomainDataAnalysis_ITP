		<content> The village boundaries have seen very 
 little alteration since the middle of 
 the seventeenth century.A consequence 
 of this fact is that the parish       
 contains a large variety of old       
 buildings - many of which are "listed"
 for preservation by both national and 
 local agencies.There are 29 which are 
 officially listed and a further 16    
 that are to be found on the local     
 list.
