		<title>01THE CITY OF HULL</title>
		<content> Hull is the largest city in the county
 of Humberside with a population of    
 269,100.  As an important commercial, 
 educational and industrial centre     
 though it serves about 850,000 people.
 This linking of the region was        
 completed with the opening of the     
 Humber Bridge by Her Majesty Queen    
 Elizabeth ll in 1981.                 
 The official title of the city is     
 Kingston-upon-Hull, given to it by    
 Edward l in 1299.  This is the first  
 note of the city being used as a port 
 as Edward used it to provision his    
 troops during wartime.                
 From then on the port and the city    
 prospered mainly due to trade from the
 Baltic and Europe.  However the main  
 thing Hull is known for is fish and   
 this is an industry, sadly, much in   
 decline in the 1980's.
