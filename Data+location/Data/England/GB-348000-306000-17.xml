		<content>    When we arrived at All Stretton    
 Hall we dumped our kit against the    
 wall.There was a stage so we made some
 plays.                                
    On the first night I didn't get to 
 sleep till 4.30 a.m. I was crawling   
 round in my sleeping bag with Anna    
 Dudley and we were throwing teddies at
 each other.In the morning when I woke 
 up everybody else was still asleep.We 
 had breakfast at 6 o'clock.           
    After we had had breakfast we went 
 into town and did some shopping.Then  
 we went to the swimming baths.I did my
 Brownie Swimmer's Badge.At the        
 swimming baths there was a diving     
 board which I jumped and dived off.   
    When we went to bed again I put    
 bubble gum in my mouth and Jane and I 
 were blowing bubbles in bed.I blew a  
 big one and it popped on my face.I had
 more sleep than the night before.     </content>
