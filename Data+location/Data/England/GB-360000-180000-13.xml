		<title>13PATCHWAY SORTING OFFICE</title>
		<content>   This was built in 1975. Before that 
 mail was sorted in a shed behind the  
 small Post Office. About 20,000       
 letters and 450 parcels are sorted    
 daily. There are 3 delivery areas:-   
 Patchway,Filton and Almondsbury.      
   In a month,postmen cover 3,539 miles
 in vans,bikes and on foot.The sorting 
 office opens at 5.20am and closes at  
 1.00p.m. The first van brings letters 
 at 5.20a.m.,the second van brings     
 letters and parcels at 6.00a.m.       
 Weekday deliveries start at 7.00 and  
 finish at 12.00noon. On Saturday they 
 finish at 10.00a.m.                   
   There are 20 postmen and 17women, 5 
 vans and 28 bikes. Patchway has 17    
 post boxes,Almondsbury 15 and Filton  
 10.                                   
   There is no weight limit on parcels 
 which can be a problem as once a      
 special van had to come from Bristol. </content>
