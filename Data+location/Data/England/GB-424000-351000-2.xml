		<title>02Life on a Farm ...</title>
		<content> My name is Paul Povey and I live on a 
 farm.We have one hundred and nineteen 
 acres of land.We are a mixed farm.Due 
 to the milk quota we only have twenty 
 two milking cows(we used to have 30). 
 We have four hundred and thirty sheep 
 ,mainly Swale's, but we also have     
 gritstone,mule and masham.We don't    
 grow many cerials now because the     
 reservoir took ten acres of good land 
 and seventeen acres of grazing land.  
 My mum rears calves and sells them but
 my dad gets the money.We have a few   
 chickens so we don't have to buy eggs.
 The disadvantages of living on a farm 
 are that you work seven days a week,  
 long hours and it is very hard work.  
 The advantages of living on a farm are
 that you are in the countryside and in
 the fresh air most of the time.You    
 also mix with a lot of animals!
