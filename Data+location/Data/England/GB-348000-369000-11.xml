		<content> Farming in the Ashton area is very    
 good.The soil is rich and the land is 
 flat.We estimate there are about 10   
 large farms in our block.A typical    
 farm is Village Farm which is in the  
 heart of Ashton.The farm has stood for
 many years but extensions have been   
 built on.Dairy cattle are kept and    
 vegetables such as early potatoes are 
 grown.Wheat and barley are also       
 important.Mr Dobson has owned the farm
 for 32 years.It has been in his wife's
 family for 2 generations.There are 72 
 to 84 cows.Sometimes they have to     
 cross the road to their fields and    
 come back at 15:00 for milking.The    
 farm has lots of machinery including  
 tractors,combine harvesters,grass     
 cutters and potato harvesters.People  
 from the village are employed on the  
 farm.2 men work full time and Mr.     
 Dobson also works on the farm.        </content>
