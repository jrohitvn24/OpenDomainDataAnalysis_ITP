		<title>12FARMING: DANE END AREA:</title>
		<content> There are nine farms in the D-block   
 and we have taken{HOME FARM, DANE END 
 as typical of the farms.              
{HOME FARM}is situated in a valley.  It
 consists of 453 acres, two-thirds     
 being arable and one-third grassland. 
 There is a herd of Friesian cows, some
 of which are pedigree and these       
 date back to the original herd which  
 was started before the 1st World War. 
 The farm is typical of many farms     
 found in{HERTFORDSHIRE,}comprising    
 various types of soil.                
 The land is low lying gravel loam and 
 the steep hillsides run to chalk on   
 one side of the farm; on the South    
 West side the land runs to London clay
 over the top of gravel which makes    
 this land difficult to drain. Other   
 farms keep sheep, pigs and chickens.
