		<title>14PRESTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content> In Domesday times,Preston was linked  
 with the manor of Temple Dinsley.Its  
 earliest name was Wedelee and the     
 first reference to 'Preston' was made 
 at the time of the Knights Templar.It 
 grew from a small hamlet,until in 1894
 an old map shows it as a complete     
 village with its own church_school, a 
 miller,butcher,tailor,wheelwright,car_
 penter,carter,bakehouse,2 shops and   
 several farms.The traders have gone   
 but the farms and 1 shop remain.The   
 village now has a separate church and 
 school and a pub.There is also a girls
 independent boarding school.The resi_ 
 dents commute to London and the nearby
 towns to work as Preston is purely a  
 residential village. There are many   
 attractive houses and the setting is  
 quiet and picturesque.
