		<title>02LOCAL HISTORY INCE BLUNDELL</title>
		<content>    The word "Ince" probably refers to 
 an island (in a marsh).  Blundell     
 comes from the name of the lords of   
 the manor, who came here with William 
 the Conqueror.  One is mentioned in   
 the Battle Abbey roll of 1094.        
                                       
    In the early l2th Century Ince was 
 included in the Barony of Warrington. 
 In early documents it is often        
 referred to as three separate         
 townships; Lady Green, Carr Houses and
 Ince Blundell.  The l844 map clearly  
 shows this and the school register    
 l877 gives addresses in this way.     
                                       
    Towards the end of the l4th Century
 "Blundell" was added to the name of   
 the village.  It is very unusual for  
 the village to take the name of the   
 chief family rather than the reverse.
