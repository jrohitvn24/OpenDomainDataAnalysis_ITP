		<title>16I.B.M. (U.K. Headquarters)</title>
		<content>  Portsmouth is surrounded by water on 
 all sides, so building land is rather 
 scarce. When I.B.M., the large        
 international computer firm, chose to 
 build their U.K. headquarters here,   
 they had to reclaim most of the land  
 form Portsmouth Harbour.              
                                       
  Work began in 1970, using chalk from 
 nearby Portsdown Hill as well as local
 refuse from dustbins. They used the   
 Dutch polder method of reclaiming     
 land, a method which needs a reservoir
 of fresh water to keep levels stable. 
                                       
  This has provided the site with a 15 
 acre lake and this has been surrounded
 by trees to make it attractive to     
 wildlife.                             
  The building was opened in 1978 and  
 gives work to about 3000 people.
