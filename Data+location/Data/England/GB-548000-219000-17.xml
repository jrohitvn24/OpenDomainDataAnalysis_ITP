		<title>17STANSTED AIRPORT</title>
		<content>  It has just been                     
 decided this month, June 1985, that   
 Stansted is to be the third London    
 airport. Stansted is a large village  
 to the North of Stortford with a small
 airport which is going to be made much
 bigger. This will mean a lot more work
 for people living in the town, and    
 lots more houses will be needed for   
 all the extra people to live in. We   
 also think it will be very noisy with 
 lots more aeroplanes flying over our  
 town. Some people think the airport   
 will be a good thing, but others think
 it will spoil the area. There will be 
 a plane taking off every half hour and
 the noise level will increase by      
 70%.The development of Stansted has   
 beeen one of the leading articles in  
 the paper.
