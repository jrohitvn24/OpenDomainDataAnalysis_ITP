		<title>11AN INTERVIEW WITH MRS SPEAR</title>
		<content> Mrs. Spear lives at Codden Farm which 
 is situated on the north west slopes  
 of Codden Hill. It is a dairy farm    
 with about 160 milking cows and its   
 own pasteurising dairy. The cows are  
 milked twice daily at twelve hour     
 intervals and the milk is pasteurised 
 daily, bottled and delivered the next 
 day. The area of distribution covers  
 Bishop's Tawton, Newport, Venn and    
 Whiddon Valley as well as some other  
 parts of Barnstaple. The farm is run  
 on an Autumn calving system which     
 means that most calves are born during
 September. The winter feeding system  
 is self-feed silage with concentrates 
 fed by an out of parlour computer     
 system. The cows are kept indoors all 
 winter in larged covered yards and    
 cubicles; this rests the ground for   
 the grass to regrow.
