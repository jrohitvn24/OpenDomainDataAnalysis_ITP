 An attempt was made to close the      
 school in 1980 but there was a        
 reprieve in the summer of 1982 when   
 children from {Cardington School} were
 transferred to Rushbury School.       
                                       
 The school now consists of an Infant  
 class in the original building and a  
 Junior class in a demountable         
 classroom. Ages of children:4to 11.   </content>
