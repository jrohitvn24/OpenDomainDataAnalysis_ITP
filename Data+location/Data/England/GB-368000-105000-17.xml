		<title>17RELIGION IN BUCKLAND NEWTON</title>
		<content>  Most people do not attend church     
 services regularly. There are two     
 churches in Buckland Newton. The      
 church of the Holy Rood and the chapel
 at Duntish.The vicar of the parish    
 church is responsible for the         
 parishes of Glanvilles Wooton,Pulham, 
 Longburton, Holnest as well as        
 Buckland Newton.He not only takes the 
 services;Communion and Matins,but     
 also visits the sick and the elderly. 
 Sometimes a lay preacher will take the
 Family Services. The popular seasons  
 and services are Christmas,Easter and 
 Harvest when thanks are given for the 
 produce and the church is full.At the 
 chapel there is a service which is    
 followed by Sunday School.A different 
 preacher takes the service each       
 Sunday. Each year the chapel has a    
 Harvest festival,Easter Service and a 
 Carol Service.                        </content>
