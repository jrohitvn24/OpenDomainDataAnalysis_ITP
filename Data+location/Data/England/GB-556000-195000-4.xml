		<content> Crow Green is situated just north of  
 Pilgrims Hatch.The older people say   
 that Crow Green is an individual      
 village,although it is not mentioned  
 on the map of Essex of 1777,but       
 younger inhabitants say it is a part  
 of Pilgrims Hatch.It centres around a 
 triangular village green at the       
 junction of Crow Green Road,Days Lane 
 and Ashwells Road.There are no        
 transport services,no shops except for
 one or two farm shops and surprisingly
 no churches.The only services in Crow 
 Green are two post boxes,with a       
 collection once a day at 9.00am.The   
 buildings in Crow Green were mainly   
 bungalows,half post war and half pre  
 war.Some pre-war bungalows had been   
 modernized.Most of the houses were    
 large detatched modernized buildings. 
 Old Brentwoods new Sports Ground is   
 now in Ashwells Lane.                 </content>
