		<title>20THE POWER STATION</title>
		<content> I think that the power station should 
 not be used for housing,because it is 
 not a place where you get the best of 
 weather.I think that it could be      
 turned into a{maritime museum},if they
 did that they could dig up the boat   
 which is by the pier.They could also  
 do maps of the surrounding sand and   
 mud-banks.They could also give        
 examples of the different kinds of    
 fish found in the surrounding sea.    
 They could use{Portishead Docks}for   
 floating exhibits.
