		<title>12ANIMAL HOLES</title>
		<content>                                       
      On our area of land we saw a     
 number of animal holes such as        
 rabbits, foxes and shrews.   The      
 rabbit hole we saw was about 10 inches
 in diameter.   We could not see much  
 of the hole as it was under tree roots
 and in the middle of a hawthorn bush. 
  The next hole we saw was a foxes.    
 It was about 14 inches in diameter and
 was also under tree roots.   The last 
 hole we saw was a shrew's hole.   It  
 was much smaller than the other holes.
 It was only about 2.5 inches in       
 diameter.
