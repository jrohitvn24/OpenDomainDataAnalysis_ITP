		<content>      We went to three bays and        
 collected information from{Home Farm }
 bay ,{St.Audries}bay and{Doniford}    
 bay.In the{cliffs}the rock consists of
 a mixture of sandstone,limestone and  
 slate but some of the cliffs are made 
 out of sand and mud .On the ground are
 pebbles and sand and large rocks. On  
 some of the rocks is wet moss.        
       In between some of the{rocks}are
 small{rockpools}with shellfish and    
 crabs and seaweed.On the shore are    
 groynes, wave breakers, and mooring   
 posts in the sea.In the sea there are 
 very strong currents.                 
      There are two bays with a{fresh  
{water spring in each.}The fresh water 
 springs are very strong.You can swim  
 and bathe in both of the bays.        
      Trees are growing on the tops of 
 the cliffs  which means the soil must 
 be very good for a coastline          </content>
