		<content>  This is a time of great change for   
 our area. The majority of large metal 
 working firms, many of which had been 
 in existence since the 19C, have      
 closed and they have been replaced by 
 new industry only to a limited extent.
 The motorway built close by makes this
 a good centre for distrubution so GKN 
 fasteners, GKN steelstock, and Tandy  
 electrical have their national        
 distribution HQ in our block.         
  Unemployment, however, is very high  
 and when people were asked about the  
 situation in our block in 1985 this   
 was what they spoke of most. Some     
 older people said the unemployment was
 worse than the 1930's particularly for
 young people. Many people said they   
 were worried about the future and they
 thought that lots of people would have
 to move away from the Wednesbury,     
 Darlaston, Tipton area.               </content>
