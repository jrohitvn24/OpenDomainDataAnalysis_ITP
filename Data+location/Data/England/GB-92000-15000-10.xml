		<title>10RELIGION ON ST.MARTINS I.O.S</title>
		<content>    On this island we have a church,it 
 was built in 1866.In the summer there 
 is a service every week,taken by      
 vicars who spend a holiday in the     
 Parsonage,which was once the home of a
 resident clergyman.The vicar who lives
 on the main island comes over once a  
 month to take a service during the    
 winter.                               
   We also have a Methodist Chapel     
 that was build in 1836.It has a Sunday
 School room next to it,but there are  
 not enough children now to run a      
 Sunday School.It is only used twice   
 a year for the Easter and Harvest     
 teas.Each week throughout the year we 
 have a chapel service.Usually it is   
 taken by the Minister or a Local      
 Preacher who cross over from St.Mary's
 weather permitting.Sometimes holiday  
 makers take a service and occasionally
 there is a united service.            </content>
