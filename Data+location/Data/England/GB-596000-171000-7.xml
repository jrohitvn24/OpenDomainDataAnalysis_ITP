		<title>07Tourism in Eastchurch</title>
		<content>      {Caravan sites}are an important  
 aspect of{tourism}in Eastchurch so we 
 decided to interview a caravan owner  
 as to why he had selected this area to
 buy a caravan.                        
       He informed us that he had paid 
 Â£4,500 for his sited{caravan}and a    
 further Â£350 annually to cover land   
 rental, electricity, water and general
 maintainance.                         
       His main criteria for selecting 
 this site was that it would provide a 
 peaceful weekend retreat from which he
 could go sightseeing. The{beach}at    
 Leysdown is also easily accessible.   
       From here he is able to visit   
 local pubs and restaurants while on   
 the site itself he has the use of     
 their swimming pool.                  
       Finally, as he lives at         
 Maidstone, Eastchurch is an ideal     
 distance for short term visits.       </content>
