    Manchester had to rehouse the      
people from the densely-built slum     
area of East Gorton.  Money was        
available but no land.  The city was   
forced to build an overspill           
elsewhere.  It chose Hyde.             
                                       
     There was considerable resistance 
to this idea.  In September 1956 a     
petition against the overspill was     
signed by many in the market place at  
Hyde.                                  
                                       
     Despite the protests the Estate   
at Hattersley was built and the first  
residents arrived in May 1963. They    
were welcomed by the Mayor.  The       
Estate was not completed until 1973    
when Queen's Walk where the shops are, 
was built.                             
                                       </content>
