More than one hundred children and     
staff contributed to the work contained
on this disk.Children from Worlingham  
Middle School and North Cove Primary   
School worked on this project and      
derived much pleasure from this.       
   The children were between the ages  
of nine and eleven and worked:out in   
thefield,with maps,on paper and on the 
computer.                              
   We hope that anyone who needs       
information from our D-Block enjoys    
reading our screen pages and viewing   
our slides.                            
   Mr.K Savage deserves a special      
mention for co-ordinating the          
computing.His local knowledge too was  
invaluable.
