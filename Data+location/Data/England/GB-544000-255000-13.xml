		<title>13Vicky's Collections</title>
		<content>   I have several strange collections. 
 I collect cardboard-the sort of card- 
 board you find in toothpaste boxes,   
 mini-cereal boxes and photo-film      
 boxes. I also collect photos of famous
 people from magazines. Other people I 
 know collect things like beer mats,   
 foreign coins,stamps,teeth,posters,   
 rubbers,postcards,stickers  and       
 different types of stationery.        
   Stamp collecting is a very popular  
 hobby throughout the world. Some old  
 stamps like 'penny blacks' are very   
 rare and valuable but you can have fun
 collecting ordinary stamps particular-
 ly if you have a pen-pal in another   
 country you can swop stamps with      
    Animals are also very popular with 
 collectors. Claire collects cats-cat  
 ornaments,cat pictures,and any object 
 either with a cat on it or in the     
 shape of a cat.                       </content>
