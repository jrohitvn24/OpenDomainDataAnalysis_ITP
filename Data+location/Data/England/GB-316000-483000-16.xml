		<title>16GAME OF BLOCKY</title>
		<content> Blocky is a game that we play at      
 Thwaites School which is played like  
 this: Someone is "It" and stands by a 
 Blocky post (anything will do) and the
 rest of the children hide.The child   
 who is "It" then hunts for everyone.If
 he sees anyone he runs back to the    
 Blocky post,tigs it and shouts,"Blocky
 one,two three!" making that child out.
 If anyone gets to the Blocky post     
 before the person who is "It",he      
 shouts,"Blocky one,two,three in!" When
 there is one person left,he has to get
 to the Blocky post before the person  
 who is "It" and shout,"Blocky         
 one,two,three save all!" and the      
 person who is "It" is "It"            
 again.Otherwise the first child who   
 was caught is "It" for the next game. 
 We wonder if anyone else plays this   
 game?
