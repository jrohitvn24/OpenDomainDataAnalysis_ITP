		<title>09The M40 Motorway</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
 The proposed M40 motorway will pass   
 close to King's Sutton when it is     
 built.   It was going to be very      
 near the houses in Wales Street and   
 take away some of the gardens.  Many  
 residents did not want a motorway     
 because they thought it took up too   
 much good farming land and there was  
 a protest meeting about it.   Now it  
 will be half a mile from the village. 
    Many people are not very pleased   
 about the motorway; they think it will
 be noisy and make pollution and they  
 will not have the benefit of it       
 because they have to go all the way to
 Banbury to find the nearest access.   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
