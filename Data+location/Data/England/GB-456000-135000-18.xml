		<content> The Group Surgery in Alresford is the 
 centre for medical care. Senior       
 citizens,bed-ridden patients and the  
 disabled are visited in their homes by
 doctors,district nurse ,chiropodists. 
 Villagers must visit dentists and     
 opticians and the nearest hospital is 
 in Winchester. There is a system of   
 "review" for patients which may       
 continue for years, either annually or
 more frequently. Transport is provided
 by ambulance or hospital car service. 
 All immediate health care is free of  
 charge but there are charges for      
 dental,optical and prescriptions.     
 Some villagers choose to pay for      
 private health care, usually via      
 health insurance schemes.
